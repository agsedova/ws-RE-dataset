They were part of the German heavy/speed/power metal scene. Their latest album, \"Santa Muerte\", was released on September 13, 2019.\n\nBased in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, Sinner released their first album, \"Wild'n'Evil\" in 1982. This album, along with the next two (\"Fast Decision\" and \"Danger Zone\") were raw affairs, having little in common with the melodic metal they would later become known for. After many personnel changes (including drummer Edgar Patrik leaving to join Bonfire), the band saw the addition of Accept's Herman Frank on guitars and the release of \"Touch of Sin\" in 1985. Frank would leave before the next album, 1986's \"Comin' Out Fighting\", with future U.D.O. guitarist Mathias Dieth replacing him.\n\n1987 saw the release of \"Dangerous Charm\", a much more melodic album than previous efforts, but shortly after this the band lost their recording contract, took a break and would not be heard of again for five years.\n\nIn 1990, Mat Sinner released a solo album called \"Back to the Bullet\" on BMG with a completely new band. Three members of the Mat Sinner band reformed Sinner and released \"No More Alibis\" in 1992, an album far heavier than anything Sinner had released before. This renewed vigour coupled with songwriting that far exceeded the band's previous releases not only carried on but strengthened with \"Respect\" in 1994 and \"Bottom Line\" in 1995, the latter staying in the Japanese national charts for five weeks. Since the reformation the band's reputation had improved immensely, touring as support for bands such as Mr. Big and Savatage as well as headlining their own German tour and releasing a live album. Sinner were to reach even higher peaks though, releasing two hugely successful albums with \"Judgement Day\" in 1997 and \"The Nature of Evil\" in 1998 before touring Europe as support for rock giants Deep Purple. \"The Nature of Evil\" was the band's most successful album to date, reaching No. 63 in the German album charts.\n\nIn 1998, Mat Sinner and Tom Naumann, who had been with Sinner since their reformation in 1992 formed Primal Fear with ex-Gamma Ray vocalist Ralf Scheepers. Mat Sinner has been involved as a driving force in both Sinner and Primal Fear to this day.\n\nIn 2000, the band saw its first line-up change in five years as several members left, including guitarist Tom Naumann while ex-Helloween and Gamma Ray's Uli Kusch filled in on drums for \"The End of Sanctuary\". However, in 2003 the previous 1995–1999 line-up renewed itself and on 20.01.2003 released \"There Will Be Execution\" before going quiet again for four years. In the past nine years the band had released six albums, each as good, if not better than the last, proving to be the band's most successful period. This success would continue, as after releasing two more albums with Primal Fear, an album with his pre-Sinner band Goddess Shiva and guesting on Tribuzy's debut album, Mat Sinner brought Sinner back to release \"Mask of Sanity\" in 2007. This album spawned two popular singles in \"Diary of Evil\" and \"Black\" and included a faithful rendition of Thin Lizzy's \"Baby Please Don't Go\".\n\nSinner album sales have never been spectacular: it is estimated they sold less than 150,000 copies of their first three releases. The band's six and seven track albums of the 1990s, \"Respect\" and \"Bottom Line\", sold less than 200,000 combined and without any real advertising except that of word of mouth. Sinner's fourth full-length album, \"Judgement Day\", received fair reviews but again had little advertising put into it as the band spent most of its money on recording. Sinner's \"Nature of Evil\" released in 1998 proved to be the band's most successful original album with over 100,000 copies sold. \"Nature of Evil\" was advertised heavily on the internet mostly on German Music web sites.\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, Sinner released two compilation albums, the first was \"Emerald Collection\" containing many tracks from \"Danger Zone\" and \"Comin' Out Fighting\". The second compilation album, which contained three songs from \"Bottom Line\", three songs from \"Nature of Evil\", four songs from \"Judgement Day\", two from live recording and three new released songs, was called \"The Second Decade\". \"The Second Decade\" became Sinner's best selling album, most of which were bought on eBay. \"The Second Decade\" by Sinner until 2005 was the only album available for sale on eBay and proved to be an international success. \"The Second Decade\" brought new fans to Europe primarily from Latin America, Japan, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Poland and Greece.\n\n\"The End of Sanctuary\" and \"There Will Be Execution\" are currently Sinner's only 21st century albums selling good and entered the German album charts. After the German Top 50 album \"Tequila Suicide\" Sinner toured Europe, Japan & Australia. The new Sinner album \"Santa Muerte\" will be released via AFM Records on September 13, 2019 incl. the first single/video \"Fiesta Y Copas\" feat. Ronnie Romero of Rainbow. Sinner has released seventeen albums and sold over a million records worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She always loved to sing and perform in front of an audience. Music was an integral part of her childhood. She sang in choruses, performed as a soloist, attended music school, and learned to play the accordion. Shortly before finishing primary school, Nuša joined a band of young musicians.\n\nAlthough Derenda originally wanted to become a preschool teacher and work part-time in a nursery school for a year, she continued to sing with the band and traveled throughout Europe. In 1990, her band broke up and Nuša, along with her partner Frenk, established a new group. By that time they had already become professional and toured Yugoslavia, Germany, and Switzerland, and were invited to the US three times. Seven years of success and hard work followed, as their act performed up to 150 concerts in a single year. Since 1998, Derenda has mostly been working with a group called Happy Hour, with whom she records music in the studio and performs live.\n\nIn 1995, Frenk and Nuša Derenda married and started thinking about permanently settling in Slovenia. She had dreamt about making an album for some time. In 1999, she fulfilled this ambition with the CD \"Vzemi me veter\" (Take Me, Wind): a song with the same title as the CD was written by her friend, Majda Arh. This song earned Nuša first place in the Slovene TV contest Orion (November 1998). At the Slovene Pop Contest 1999 (\"Slovenska popevka\") Nuša received the award for best singer, and at the MMS festival (Melodies of the Sea and the Sun) the second prize from the audience with the song \"Boginja\" (The Goddess; written by Urša and Matjaž Vlašič, and Boštjan Grabnar). The same team of songwriter helped her win the Orion 2000 contest with the song \"Čez dvajset let\" (In Twenty Years). This group of songwriters also accompanied her to the festival MMS 2000 (Melodies of the Sea and Sun). Nuša Derenda sang the song \"Ne kliči me\" (Don't Call Me) and won the audience prize for the second time.\n\nIn November 2000, the first HIT Festival was held, and Nuša Derenda won with the song \"Ni mi žal\" (I'm Not Sorry). In December the same year she issued a CD with the same title.\n\nWinning the EMA 2001 attracted greater media attention and popularity. She participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 in Copenhagen with the song \"Energy\" (Ne, ni res), where she finished seventh, achieving the best result for Slovenia (as of 2017).\nIn 2001, thanks to her Eurovision performance, she attended the International Golden Stag Festival in Braşov, Romania. There, she won a special prize from the Ministry of Culture for the best interpretation of a Romanian-language song. Nuša also visited Germany for the Eurosong Fan Club Party in Cologne, where she also held a solo concert. At the end of October 2001, she was invited to Croatia to Zadarfest. There she was awarded second place by the professional jury, and the prize for the best lyrics. That same year 2001 also brought her Victor of Popularity in the music category, which is presented every year by the magazine \"Stop\": the winner is selected by its readers. Also that year, she received the \"Zlati petelin\" (Golden Rooster) award for the song \"Ni mi žal\" (I'm Not Sorry).\n\nNuša became one of the candidates for Slovene Woman of the Year 2001. 2002 was marked by victory at \"Slovenska popevka\" (Slovene Pop Contest) with the song \"Pesek v oči\" (Deception). At the beginning of December 2002, she released her third CD with the title \"Na štiri oči\" (In Private).\n\nIn 2003, Nuša again attended the HIT Festival – the third in succession – and won with the song \"V ogenj zdaj obleci me\" (Dress Me With Fire). The song won the prize from professional jury for the best music and lyrics.\n\nHer Greatest Hits Collection 1998–2003 (\"Največji uspehi 1998/2003\") was released in April 2004. The CD contains most of the popular songs from the beginning of her career to her latest tracks to date of release.\n\nOn September 5 that year, she hosted \"Slovenska popevka 2004\" (Slovene Song 2004) at Križanke in Ljubljana and successfully passed the challenge of TV host.\n\nFrom September 6 to 12, 2004, she participated in the 3rd Megahit-International Mediterranean Song Contest at the Fethiye tourist centre in southern Turkey. The Mediterranean Song Contest is an international music festival, founded by the END PRODUCTION company, led by Serhat Hacipasalioglu. The festival promotes popular music of Mediterranean countries. Its motto is \"Music Unites Peace and Friendship\". With 91 points, Nuša won a perfect third place with the song \"Devil\" at the award ceremony in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2301005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301005", "title": "Lee Chaolan", "text": "Lee Chaolan\n\nLee Chaolan (Chinese: 李 超狼; pinyin: \"Lǐ Chāoláng\"; Japanese: リー・チャオラン; Hepburn: \"Rī Chaoran\") is a player character from the \"Tekken\" fighting game franchise by Bandai Namco Entertainment. He is an orphan adopted by Heihachi Mishima, head of the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation, and later becoming embroiled in a one-sided rivalry with his adoptive brother, Kazuya Mishima. The defeat of Kazuya is Lee's primary objective in entering the King of Iron Fist fighting tournaments. Since making his debut in the original \"Tekken\", Lee has been a mainstay in the series, appearing in every subsequent game except for \"Tekken 3\", and has at times appeared as an alter ego named Violet, who is additionally playable in several series installments. Outside of the games, Lee has appeared in two animated \"Tekken\" films, and he has received critical reception for his flamboyant personality and particularly his \"Tekken 5\" ending.\n\nLee is the Chinese adoptive son of Heihachi Mishima, whose own son Kazuya's defeat is Lee's motivation for entering the numerous King of Iron Fist tournaments held throughout the \"Tekken\" series. Lee was adopted by Heihachi to provide a rival for Kazuya, who he felt was too weak to lead his Mishima Zaibatsu company. Lee studies in the United States alongside Paul Phoenix and Marshall Law. After Kazuya wins control of the company, Lee works as Kazuya's secretary, in addition to overseeing Kazuya's team of bodyguards and Dr. Bosconovitch's experiments, all while secretly hoping to take over the Zaibatsu. However, Lee is soon expelled from the Zaibatsu for unknown reasons while Heihachi disowns him, causing him to leave the world of fighting and pursuing a career in robotics.\n\nLee returns in \"Tekken 4\" as a playboy whose robotics operation is a success. Upon learning that the Zaibatsu's rival G Corporation was attacked by the Tekken Force, Lee joins the fourth tournament after changing his appearance and calling himself Violet in order to conceal his identity, while hoping to test his new \"Combot\" experiment in the process. However, he is defeated early by Kazuya, whom Lee had believed to be dead, but he then learns someone else had controlled the Zaibatsu in Heihachi's absence. Believing it to be Kazuya, Lee enters the fifth tournament in \"Tekken 5\" to take him out personally and regain control of the Zaibatsu, but upon learning that the culprit is Heihachi's father Jinpachi, he drops out of the tournament and returns to his business. After Kazuya legitimately takes control of the company, Lee enters the next tournament in attempt again to come in contact with Kazuya. In the game's \"Scenario Campaign\" story mode, Lee joins forces with Julia Chang, Lars Alexandersson, and Dr. Bosconovitch's android daughter Alisa, due to their shared objective of stopping Kazuya and Jin, but Lee and Lars are not aware at first that Alisa was created to serve Jin, thus acting as a mole for Lars. When Alisa is destroyed at the climax, Lee promises Lars that she will be reconstructed with his company's resources, which he finally succeeded at the same time of Heihachi's return in the seventh tournament.\n\nLee is selectable in the noncanonical games \"Tekken Tag Tournament\", \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", \"\", and \"Tekken Revolution\".\n\nThe first \"Tekken\" features Lee wearing a simple purple vest and black pants, a color palette that would regularly be used for the character. In \"Tekken 4\", Lee has a more formal design with a purple dress shirt, white vest and matching pants. Lee's primary outfit for \"Tekken 5\" and \"6\" is a retread of his original costume from the first game embellished with a fishnet undershirt and a black collar. An alternate \"Tekken 5\" costume was designed by manga artist and character designer Ryōji Minagawa. For \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", Lee wears a black leather vest with a unicorn printed on the back. Lee's \"Tekken 7\" design is his most elaborate, with a suit and tie worn beneath a long purple overcoat. A constant for Lee throughout his series appearances has been his silver hair, which, as Violet, changes to dark purple to go with an open-chested purple dress shirt and sunglasses. In response to a fan's tweet requesting Lee's inclusion in \"Tekken 7\", \"Tekken\" producer Katsushiro Harada joked that a future installment would need to include \"130 characters\" to satisfy the series' fanbase.\n\nGameSpy considered non-walled arenas in \"Tekken 4\" and \"Tekken 5\" to be a disadvantage for Lee players, but added that he was among \"the faster characters in the game\" with \"good combo ability\". The site said of Lee in \"Tekken 6\", \"Lee has the best use of Okizeme in the game\", though his \"attacks only have average reach and damage.\" 1UP.com wrote in 2013: \"Playing mind games with your opponent is one of Lee’s specialties. After a juggle, you have the option to manipulate your opponent in whether to stay on the ground, roll back, or get straight back up.\" \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\" includes a \"Fight Lab\" tutorial, where players control training robot Combot under Violet's guidance and face a series of bizarre opponents.\n\nLee appears in the 1997 OVA \"\" as one of the main antagonists. In the film, he is mentioned as being a former underground fighter known as the Silver Devil. Heihachi plans to hand the Mishima Zaibatsu over to Kazuya should he defeat Heihachi in the upcoming tournament, but Lee wants the company for himself and therefore hires assassins Nina and Anna Williams to kill Kazuya, a task they repeatedly fail. During the tournament, Lee tests his new experiments on the fighters: humanoid dinosaurs called Rex (based on Alex). His plan backfires as Anna is devoured by one of the creatures, while Kazuya kills the others before scaring the last surviving one away. Lee then confronts Kazuya at the doors of the Zaibatsu tower, but he is beaten with a single punch and Heihachi discards him for being worthless. Lee subsequently commits suicide by entering the tower, killing all its security personnel before setting the island's self-destruction sequence, and remaining inside when it explodes. The explosion causes a chain reaction that takes out the entire island that had served as the tournament grounds, but both Kazuya and Heihachi escape in time. Lee was voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki in the original Japanese version, and by David Stokey in the film's English dubbing.\n\nLee's personality differs in the 2011 CGI film \"\", in which he has a minor role as a wealthy and eccentric teacher at Kyoto International School. He aids Alisa, Ling Xiaoyu, and Panda during an escape by providing them shelter, but part of his mansion is later destroyed in a fight between Anna and Nina. He was voiced by Ryôtarô Okiayu in the original Japanese version, and by Kaiji Tang in the English dub.\n\nElton Jones of \"Complex\" described Lee in 2012 as \"Heihachi's adopted son and the man that invented 'swagged out martial arts.'\" Tom Goulter of \"GamesRadar\" remarked on Lee's adoption into the Mishima family: \"One suspects that the entire storyline of \"Tekken\" would be rendered void if anyone had just given the young Heihachi some decent parenting literature.\" Gavin Jasper of 4thletter.net ranked Lee's \"Tag Tournament 2\" ending, in which a tuxedo-clad Lee nonchalantly beats up a group of soldiers while walking with his assistant to his robotics laboratory, 125th in his 2013 rating of the 200 greatest fighting game endings: \"When people describe someone as being 'like a boss,' they’re really comparing him to Lee Chaolan.\" Mike Luces of \"International Business Times\" considered Lee's inclusion in \"Tekken 7\" to be a \"highlight\" of the game. Rich Knight of \"Complex\" ranked Lee's appearance in \"Tekken: Blood Vengeance\" as the fifth-\"craziest\" \"Tekken\" series moment in 2012: \"Lee is probably one of the weirdest characters we’ve ever seen, as he’s giving random thumbs up and calling young girls his 'kittens.'\" Charles Webb of MTV.com described Lee's extravagant mansion in the film as \"the definition of 'swag'\". In an official fan poll hosted by Namco in 2012, Lee was the eleventh-most requested \"Tekken\" character (9.28% of 88,280 votes) for inclusion in the crossover fighter \"Tekken X Street Fighter\", in which he did not appear.\n\nLee's \"Tekken 5\" ending, which depicts him living luxuriously with Heihachi as his personal servant dressed only in swim briefs and a bow tie, has received critical attention for its perceived homoeroticism. In 2009, Michael Harradence of \"PlayStation Universe\" ranked it as the seventh-greatest \"Tekken\" ending of all time: \"Lee enjoys the fruits of his labor and humiliates Heihachi by having him serve as his thong-wearing poolside lackey.\" However, Cracked.com included it in their 2013 feature \"6 Video Game Endings That Are Clearly F#@%ing With Us,\" commenting: \"There is not a doubt in my mind that the makers of that cutscene had to delete 40 minutes of video because the rating system would not allow for a full-length hardcore gay porno.\" In his 2013 feature \"10 Video Game Endings with Disturbing Implications You Totally Missed\", Simon Gallagher of WhatCulture placed Lee's ending third: \"All of this strange Oedipal mesh plays out as both men are wearing nothing more than speedos ... and we are encouraged to laugh at the misfortune of the fallen villain (as well as marvel at his firm, ancient body) while he is powerless to run or fight back. Seriously?\"\n"}

Dobson was then succeeded in August 2016 by AJ Sherrill, former pastor of Trinity Grace Church: Chelsea in NYC.\n\nFounded in February 1999, the church's services, or \"gatherings\", were originally celebrated in a school gym in Wyoming, Michigan. Based on the idea that worship could be stripped down to its simplest form, it quickly grew in popularity. Through word-of-mouth and the launch support of Calvary Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the church attracted about 1,000 visitors to their first gathering. Within a year the church had the defunct Grand Village Mall donated to them and purchased the land on which it is now located in Grandville, Michigan. After some remodeling, the 3,500 seat facility opened its doors in July 2000. In the early 2000s, the church attracted around 6,000 churchgoers to its two Sunday services and up to 50,000 downloads per week. As of 2018, this community has worked hard to establish themselves as a local church, while still offering weekly podcasts of their teachings that are listened to by thousands around the world. Their current weekly attendance is around 2500. \n\nThe church's founding pastor, Rob Bell, founded the church at 28 years old, and served as Mars Hill's Teaching Pastor until 2011. On August 1, 2005, Zondervan Publishing released his first book, \"Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith\". His second book, \"Sex God\", was released in 2007 through the same publishing company, and in 2008, former Lead Pastor Don Golden co-wrote a book with Bell titled \"\"Jesus Wants to Save Christians: A Manifesto for the Church in Exile.\"\" Upon Golden's departure, Mars Hill shifted to a team leadership structure while retaining an executive pastor, currently Brian Mucci. In 2010 Shane Hipps joined Mars Hill, splitting time with Bell as teaching pastor. Hipps had previously pastored a small Mennonite Church in Arizona, Trinity Mennonite Church. Prior to his pastoral ministry, Hipps had worked in marketing and advertising for Porsche. In March 2011 Bell released a book titled \"Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell And The Fate Of Every Person Who Ever Lived\". The church announced on 9 September 2011 that Bell would be leaving the church in pursuit of new opportunities. On 18 December 2011, Bell delivered his final message as the head pastor of Mars Hill, saying farewell to the community in which he had a critical role in launching nearly 13 years prior.\n\nFollowing Bell's departure, a national search was conducted and in August 2012, it was announced that Kent Dobson would take over the role as sole teaching pastor. Previously, Dobson had served as worship director during the early years of the church. \n\nIn November 2015, Dobson announced he was leaving Mars Hill telling the congregation \"being a pastor at a church is not really who I am.\" Dobson was succeeded in August 2016 by AJ Sherrill, former pastor of Trinity Grace Church: Chelsea in NYC.\n\nThe church is somewhat different from other large mega-churches in that it places little emphasis on high-tech production during its weekly gatherings. The church's sanctuary (formerly the anchor store of the mall) reflects this simplistic outlook; the sanctuary walls are a light gray with a black ceiling, the lights are low, and there is a freestanding homemade wooden cross in the sanctuary on communion Sundays. The multimedia projections are white text on a black background with no additional flair or background images. There is a belief that the gatherings should not be a performance as many megachurches are often known for, but should be the gathering of the church in worship and the place where the church is, in turn, motivated to go out and live the life of the gospel, the kingdom of God within the world.\n\nMars Hill receives the financial tithes and offerings of the people through \"joy boxes\" that are located in the back of the room (versus a traditional “pass the plate” tithing moment). The initial 25% of the offering is given away to global and local partners in order to \"join God where He is already at work among some of the most church-forsaken peoples, places and issues of our city and world.\" This figure is public knowledge and the individual missionaries supported are highlighted on a regular basis through preaching stories, video testimonies, and strategic updates in \"the Sheet\", their bi-weekly bulletin. The mission of Mars Hill Bible Church is \"\"Living out the way of Jesus in missional communities, announcing the arrival of his kingdom, working for measurable change among the oppressed.\"\"\n\nTheir approach to theology is narrative in nature, seeking to view the Scripture as an unfolding drama in which the church has a unique role. Matt Krick, lead pastor at Bay Marin Community Church, and a former pastor at Mars Hill and former intern for Rob Bell, greatly influenced the theological stance of Mars Hill. He has been influenced by theologians like Brian Walsh, Sylvia Keesmaat, Richard Middleton, and Steven Bouma-Prediger.\n\nTheir New Exodus Theology, which former lead pastor Don Golden brought to them, is based upon his research and study of the Exodus Narrative and the OT prophetic voices of a forthcoming new exodus, which is fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth. The New Exodus motif, in his view, can be expressed as follows. It begins in Egypt where God \"hears the cry\" of the oppressed. It moves to Sinai where God makes a covenant with the descendants of Abraham, giving them a \"purpose and mission.\" Third - Jerusalem - where Israel has a choice to be \"indifferent\" using forced labor to build their own kingdom or to promote a \"kingdom of righteousness and justice.\" Finally, Babylon is the place where there is hope for a New Exodus, that ultimately climaxes in Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The church, in Golden's view, is called to live out the gospel in missional and communal ways, particularly promoting the care of the poor and oppressed of our world. This approach is considered by the ministry of Mars Hill to be a holistic understanding of the bible. \nN.T. Wright presents his five-act hermeneutic as follows. Today we find ourselves within the fifth act, called to live out the gospel in imaginative, creative, and improvisational ways.\n\nAct 1 - Creation,\nAct 2 - Fall,\nAct 3 - Israel,\nAct 4 - Jesus,\nAct 5 - Church,\n\nMars Hill Bible Church occupies a building which was originally a shopping mall called Grand Village Mall. The mall, including a Witmark catalog showroom as an anchor store, closed in the late 1990s and was converted into the current home of Mars Hill.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301052", "title": "Poverty reduction", "text": "Poverty reduction\n\nPoverty reduction, or poverty alleviation, is a set of measures, both economic and humanitarian, that are intended to permanently lift people out of poverty.\n\nMeasures, like those promoted by Henry George in his economics classic \"Progress and Poverty\", are those that raise, or are intended to raise, ways of enabling the poor to create wealth for themselves as a means of ending poverty forever. In modern times, various economists within the Georgism movement propose measures like the land value tax to enhance access to the natural world for all. Poverty occurs in both developing countries and developed countries. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures.\n\nPoverty has been historically accepted in some parts of the world as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little, while populations grew almost as fast, making wealth scarce. Geoffrey Parker wrote that Poverty reduction occurs largely as a result of overall economic growth. Food shortages were common before modern agricultural technology and in places that lack them today, such as nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation methods. The dawn of the Industrial Revolution led to high economic growth, eliminating mass poverty in what is now considered the developed world. World GDP per person quintupled during the 20th century. In 1820, 75% of humanity lived on less than a dollar a day, while in 2001 only about 20% did.\n\nToday, continued economic development is constrained by the lack of economic freedoms. Economic liberalization requires extending property rights to the poor, especially to land. Financial services, notably savings, can be made accessible to the poor through technology, such as mobile banking. Inefficient institutions, corruption, and political instability can also discourage investment. Aid and government support in health, education, and infrastructure helps growth by increasing human and physical capital.\n\nPoverty alleviation also involves improving the living conditions of people who are already poor. Aid, particularly in the medical and scientific areas, is essential in providing better lives, such as the Green Revolution and the eradication of smallpox. Problems with today's development aid include the high proportion of tied aid, which mandates receiving nations to buy products, often more expensive, originating only from donor countries. Nevertheless, some believe (Peter Singer in his book \"The Life You Can Save\") that small changes in the ways people in affluent nations lives their lives could solve world poverty.\n\nSome commentators have claimed that, due to economic liberalization, poverty in the world is rising rather than declining, and the data provided by the World Bank, which shows poverty is decreasing, is flawed. They also argue that extending property rights protection to the poor is one of the most important poverty reduction strategies a nation can implement. Securing property rights to land, the largest asset for most societies, is vital to their economic freedom. The World Bank concludes that increasing land rights is 'the key to reducing poverty' citing that land rights greatly increase poor people's wealth, in some cases doubling it. It is estimated that state recognition of the property of the poor would give them assets worth 40 times all the foreign aid since 1945. Although approaches varied, the World Bank said the key issues were security of tenure and ensuring land transactions were low cost. In China and India, noted reductions in poverty in recent decades have occurred mostly as a result of the abandonment of collective farming in China and the cutting of government red tape in India.\n\nNew enterprises and foreign investment can be driven away by the results of inefficient institutions, corruption, the weak rule of law and excessive bureaucratic burdens. It takes two days, two bureaucratic procedures, and $280 to open a business in Canada while an entrepreneur in Bolivia must pay $2,696 in fees, wait 82 business days, and go through 20 procedures to do the same. Such costly barriers favor big firms at the expense of small enterprises where most jobs are created. In India before economic reforms, businesses had to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which was in effect a tax on business.\n\nHowever, ending government sponsorship of social programs is sometimes advocated as a free market principle with tragic consequences. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer that many farmers cannot afford at market prices. The reconfiguration of public financing in former Soviet states during their transition to a market economy called for reduced spending on health and education, sharply increasing poverty.\n\nTrade liberalization increases total surplus of trading nations. Remittances sent to poor countries, such as India, are sometimes larger than foreign direct investment and total remittances are more than double aid flows from OECD countries. Foreign investment and export industries helped fuel the economic expansion of fast growing Asian nations. However, trade rules are often unfair as they block access to richer nations' markets and ban poorer nations from supporting their industries. Processed products from poorer nations, in contrast to raw materials, get vastly higher tariffs at richer nations' ports. A University of Toronto study found the dropping of duty charges on thousands of products from African nations because of the African Growth and Opportunity Act was directly responsible for a \"surprisingly large\" increase in imports from Africa. Deals can sometimes be negotiated to favor the developing country such as in China, where laws compel foreign multinationals to train their future Chinese competitors in strategic industries and render themselves redundant in the long term. In Thailand, the 51 percent rule compels multinational corporations starting operations in Thailand give 51 percent control to a Thai company in a joint venture.\n\nLong run economic growth per person is achieved through increases in capital (factors that increase productivity), both human and physical, and technology. Improving human capital, in the form of health, is needed for economic growth. Nations do not necessarily need wealth to gain health. For example, Sri Lanka had a maternal mortality rate of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today. It reduced it to 0.5–0.6% in the 1950s and to 0.06% today. However, it was spending less each year on maternal health because it learned what worked and what did not. Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive but educational measures to disseminate what works are available, such as the disease control priorities project. Promoting hand washing is one of the most cost effective health intervention and can cut deaths from the major childhood diseases of diarrhea and pneumonia by half.\n\nHuman capital, in the form of education, is an even more important determinant of economic growth than physical capital. Deworming children costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition and is only a twenty-fifth as expensive to increase school attendance as by constructing schools.\n\nUN economists argue that good infrastructure, such as roads and information networks, helps market reforms to work. China claims it is investing in railways, roads, ports and rural telephones in African countries as part of its formula for economic development. It was the technology of the steam engine that originally began the dramatic decreases in poverty levels. Cell phone technology brings the market to poor or rural sections. With necessary information, remote farmers can produce specific crops to sell to the buyers that brings the best price.\n\nSuch technology also helps bring economic freedom by making financial services accessible to the poor. Those in poverty place overwhelming importance on having a safe place to save money, much more so than receiving loans. Also, a large part of microfinance loans are spent on products that would usually be paid by a checking or savings account. Mobile banking addresses the problem of the heavy regulation and costly maintenance of saving accounts. Mobile financial services in the developing world, ahead of the developed world in this respect, could be worth $5 billion by 2012. Safaricom's M-Pesa launched one of the first systems where a network of agents of mostly shopkeepers, instead of bank branches, would take deposits in cash and translate these onto a virtual account on customers' phones. Cash transfers can be done between phones and issued back in cash with a small commission, making remittances safer.\n\nHowever, several academic studies have shown that mobile phones have only limited effect on poverty reduction when not accompanied by other basic infrastructure development.\n\nEconomic growth has the indirect potential to alleviate poverty, as a result of simultaneous increases in employment opportunities and labour productivity. A study by researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) of 24 countries that experienced growth found that in 18 cases, poverty was alleviated. However, employment is no guarantee of escaping poverty, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of workers are poor, not earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day poverty line. For instance, in India most of the chronically poor are wage earners in formal employment, because their jobs are insecure and low paid and offer no chance to accumulate wealth to avoid risks. This appears to be the result of a negative relationship between employment creation and increased productivity, when a simultaneous positive increase is required to reduced poverty. According to the UNRISD, increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.\n\nIncreases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"working poor\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labour market policies. This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show. In Vietnam, for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued. Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s. The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as manufacturing. The services sector is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth. Agriculture provides a safety net for jobs and economic buffer when other sectors are struggling. This study suggests a more nuanced understanding of economic growth and quality of life and poverty alleviation.\n\nRaising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three quarters of the poor today are farmers. Estimates show that growth in the agricultural productivity of small farmers is, on average, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country's population as growth generated in nonagricultural sectors. For example, a 2012 study suggested that new varieties of chickpea could benefit Ethiopian farmers in future. The study assessed the potential economic and poverty impact of 11 improved chickpea varieties, released by the national agricultural research organization of Ethiopia in collaboration with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, (ICRISAT). The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty. The authors concluded that further investments in the chickpea and other legume research in Ethiopia were therefore justified as a means of poverty alleviation.\n\nImproving water management is an effective way to help reduce poverty among farmers. With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.\n\nThe International Water Management Institute in Colombo, Sri Lanka aims to improve the management of land and water resources for food, livelihoods and the environment. One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.\n\nMaking employment opportunities available is just as important as increasing income and access to basic needs. Poverty activist Paul Polak has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating \"radically\" affordable goods. In his book \"Out of Poverty\" he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems. He lists \"Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths\": that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty. Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency. However, businesses designed with a social goal in mind, such as micro finance banks, may be able to make a difference.\n\nA 2012 World Bank research article, \"A Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India,\" looked at the three nations' strategies and their relative challenges and successes. During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\"\n\nAid in its simplest form is a basic income grant, a form of social security periodically providing citizens with money. In pilot projects in Namibia, where such a program pays just $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, child malnutrition rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew 10%. Aid could also be rewarded based on doing certain requirements. Conditional Cash Transfers, widely credited as a successful anti-poverty program, is based on actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving vaccinations. In Mexico, for example, the country with the largest such program, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families to stay at home rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children are prevented from begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.\n\nWelfare states have an effect on poverty reduction. Currently modern, expansive welfare states that ensure economic opportunity, independence and security in a near universal manner are still the exclusive domain of the developed nations. commonly constituting at least 20% of GDP, with the largest Scandinavian welfare states constituting over 40% of GDP. These modern welfare states, which largely arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, seeing their greatest expansion in the mid 20th century, and have proven themselves highly effective in reducing relative as well as absolute poverty in all analyzed high-income OECD countries.\n\nPhilosopher Thomas Pogge is a supporter of gathering funds for the poor by using a sort of Global Resources Dividend.\n\nA major proportion of aid from donor nations is 'tied', mandating that a receiving nation buy products originating only from the donor country. This can be harmful economically. For example, Eritrea is forced to spend aid money on foreign goods and services to build a network of railways even though it is cheaper to use local expertise and resources. Money from the United States to fight AIDS requires it be spent on U.S brand name drugs that can cost up to $15,000 a year compared to $350 a year for generics from other countries. Only Norway, Denmark, Netherlands and Britain have stopped tying their aid.\n\nSome people disagree with aid when looking at where the development aid money from NGOs and other funding is going. Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control. Through this ranking system, the disease that cause the most mortality and are most easily treated are given the funding. The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.\n\nSome think tanks and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries, or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives. Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient, and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance. Policy becomes much more oriented toward what will get more aid money than it does towards meeting the needs of the people. Problems with the aid system and not aid itself are that the aid is excessively directed towards the salaries of consultants from donor countries, the aid is not spread properly, neglecting vital, less publicized area such as agriculture, and the aid is not properly coordinated among donors, leading to a plethora of disconnected projects rather than unified strategies.\n\nSupporters of aid argue that these problems may be solved with better auditing of how the aid is used. Immunization campaigns for children, such as against polio, diphtheria and measles have saved millions of lives. Aid from non-governmental organizations may be more effective than governmental aid; this may be because it is better at reaching the poor and better controlled at the grassroots level. As a point of comparison, the annual world military spending is over $1 trillion.\n\nOne of the proposed ways to help poor countries that emerged during the 1980s has been debt relief. Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations \"to get out of the hole\". If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education. Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.\n\nUniversal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size—an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.\n\nOne of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of irrigation. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Vietnam country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to microcredit for taking up small-scale farm activities.\n\nThe empowerment of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with gender inequality. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies. In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty, policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men. In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the World Bank, suggesting that promoting gender equality through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.\n\nAddressing gender equality and empowering women are necessary steps in overcoming poverty and furthering development as supported by the human development and capabilities approach and the Millennium Development Goals. Disparities in the areas of education, mortality rates, health and other social and economic indicators impose large costs on well-being and health of the poor, which diminishes productivity and the potential to reduce poverty. The limited opportunities of women in most societies restrict their aptitude to improve economic conditions and access services to enhance their well-being.\n\nGender mainstreaming, the concept of placing gender issues into the mainstream of society, was established by the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women as a global strategy for promoting gender equality; the UN conference emphasized the necessity to ensure that gender equality is a primary goal in all areas of social and economic development, which includes the discussion of poverty and its reduction. Correspondingly, the World Bank also created objectives to address poverty with respect to the different effects on women. One important goal was the revision of laws and administrative practices to ensure women's equal rights and access to economic resources. Mainstreaming strengthens women's active involvement in poverty alleviation by linking women's capabilities and contributions with macro-economic issues. The underlying purpose of both the UN and World Bank policies speaks to the use of discussion of gender issues in the promotion of gender equality and reduction of poverty.\n\nSeveral platforms have been adopted and reiterated across many organizations in support of the empowerment of women with the specific aim of reducing poverty. Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.\n\nWomen's economic empowerment, or ensuring that women and men have equal opportunities to generate and manage income, is an important step to enhancing their development within the household and in society. Additionally, women play an important economic role in addressing poverty experienced by children. By increasing female participation in the labor force, women are able to contribute more effectively to economic growth and income distribution since having a source of income elevates their financial and social status. However, women's entry into the paid labor force does not necessarily equate to reduction of poverty; the creation of decent employment opportunities and movement of women from the informal work sector to the formal labor market are key to poverty reduction. Other ways to encourage female participation in the workforce to promote decline of poverty include providing childcare services, increasing educational quality and opportunities, and furthering entrepreneurship for women.\nProtection of property rights is a key element in economically empowering women and fostering economic growth overall for both genders. With legitimate claims to land, women gain bargaining power, which can be applied to their lives outside of and within the household. The ability and opportunity for women to lawfully own land also decreases the asset gap that exists between women and men, which promotes gender equality.\n\nPolitical participation is supported by organizations such as IFAD as one pillar of gender equality and women's empowerment. Sustainable economic growth requires poor people to have influence on the decisions that affect their lives; specifically strengthening women's voices in the political process builds social independence and greater consideration of gender issues in policy. In order to promote women's political empowerment, the United Nations Development Programme advocated for several efforts: increase women in public office; strengthen advocate ability of women's organizations; ensure fair legal protection; and provide equivalent health and education. Fair political representation and participation enable women to lobby for more female-specific poverty reduction policies and programs.\n\nEfficient institutions that are not corrupt and obey the rule of law make and enforce good laws that provide security to property and businesses. Efficient and fair governments would work to invest in the long-term interests of the nation rather than plunder resources through corruption. Researchers at UC Berkeley developed what they called a \"Weberianness scale\" which measures aspects of bureaucracies and governments which Max Weber described as most important for rational-legal and efficient government over 100 years ago. Comparative research has found that the scale is correlated with higher rates of economic development. With their related concept of good governance World Bank researchers have found much the same: Data from 150 nations have shown several measures of good governance (such as accountability, effectiveness, rule of law, low corruption) to be related to higher rates of economic development.\n\nFunds from aid and natural resources are often diverted into private hands and then sent to banks overseas as a result of graft. If Western banks rejected stolen money, says a report by Global Witness, ordinary people would benefit \"in a way that aid flows will never achieve\". The report asked for more regulation of banks as they have proved capable of stanching the flow of funds linked to terrorism, money-laundering or tax evasion.\n\nSome, like Thomas Pogge, call for a global organization that can manage some form of Global Resources Dividend, which could evolve in complexity with time.\n\nExamples of good governance leading to economic development and poverty reduction include Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Vietnam, which tend to have a strong government, called a \"hard state\" or \"development state\". These \"hard states\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for pay and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.\n\nThe United Nations Development Program published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \"Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\" Despite the promise of such research several questions remain, such as where good governance comes from and how it can be achieved. The comparative analysis of one sociologist suggests that broad historical forces have shaped the likelihood of good governance. Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before colonialism, as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.\n\nAnother approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is Fair Trade which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.\n\nCommunity and monetary economist Thomas H. Greco, Jr. has argued that the mainstream global economy with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern barter clubs and historical local currencies such as the Wörgl Experiment at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of community currency as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.\n\nThe Toronto Dollar is an example of a local currency oriented towards reducing poverty. Toronto Dollars are sold and redeemed in such a way that raise funds which are then given as grants to local charities, primarily ones oriented towards reducing poverty. Toronto Dollars also provide a means to create an incentive for welfare recipients to work: Toronto dollars can be given as gifts to welfare recipients who perform volunteer work for charitable and non-profit organizations, and these gifts do not affect welfare benefits.\n\nSome have argued for radical economic change in the system. There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented. Such proposals have been put forward by both left-wing and right-wing groups: socialism, communism, anarchism, libertarianism, binary economics and participatory economics, among others.\n\nInequality can be reduced by progressive tax.\n\nIn law, there has been a move to establish the absence of poverty as a human right.\n\nThe IMF and member countries have produced Poverty Reduction Strategy papers or PRSPs.\n\nIn his book \"The End of Poverty\", prominent economist Jeffrey Sachs laid out a plan to eradicate global poverty by 2025. Following his recommendations, international organizations such as the Global Solidarity Network are working to help eradicate poverty worldwide with intervention in the areas of housing, food, education, basic health, agricultural inputs, safe drinking water, transportation and communications.\n\nThe Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign is an organization in the United States working to secure freedom from poverty for all by organizing the poor themselves. The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty. \n\nThe increase in extreme weather events, linked to climate change, and resulting disasters is expected to continue. Disasters are a major cause of impoverishment and can reverse progress towards poverty reduction.\n\nIt is predicted that by 2030, 325 million (plus) extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard prone countries. Most of these are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA researcher at a leading global think-tank, the Overseas Development Institute, suggests that far more effort should be done to better coordinate and integrate poverty reduction strategies with climate change adaptation. The two issues are argued to be currently only dealt with in parallel as most poverty reduction strategy papers ignore climate change adaptation altogether, while National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) likewise do not deal directly with poverty reduction. Adaptation-poverty linkages were found to be strongest in NAPAs from sub-Saharan Africa LDCs.\n\nExperiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.\n\nEradication of extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the Sachs Report (for the UN Millennium Project) proposes a series of \"quick wins\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:\n\nThe first of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events. As the decade that began in 2002, the percentage of the world's population living under the poverty line by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. If during those 10 years growth rates prevailed over the next 15 years, it is possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.\n\nPoverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes. There are several poverty targeting methods through which poor communities are identified and tracked for poverty reduction programmes. For instance, one common method of poverty targeting is 'means testing' that uses a certain income or expenditure threshold for an individual or the a household to be considered as poor and eligible for support.\n\nAn important part of the fight against poverty are efforts to end hunger and achieve food security. In April 2012, the Food Assistance Convention was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 Copenhagen Consensus recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against malaria and AIDS.\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved Sustainable Development Goals. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.\n\nIn 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.\n\nThe partnership Compact2025, led by IFPRI with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.\n\nThe EndingHunger campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAnother initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010, this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries.\n\nIn spite of the intensive reduction strategies deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced. Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined. While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise. Unless suitable reduction procedures are formulated and implemented in the near future, rustic poverty will probably be a real issue for quite some long time. Families are determined to be low-pay if their monthly income does not surpass the evaluated monthly minimum set by every city or region. To meet the family's essential needs (shelter, food, clothing, and education) in Taipei, one would need to have $337 every month. This sum changes relying upon the city's way of life; for instance, one would just need to have $171 every month to live in Kinmen County.\n\nSustained economic growth is noted as the main propelling agent for Poverty Reduction in Taiwan. While internal FDI has no noteworthy effect on the mean wage of poor people, outward FDI from Taiwan in the previous two decades appears to have adversely affected the poorest 20% of the populace. Poverty in Taiwan has nearly been eliminated, with under 1 percent of the populace considered as poor or earning the low-level pay. This implies more than 99 percent of the populace appreciates the advantages of Taiwan's economic flourishing and extraordinarily enhanced personal satisfaction. Beside lowly-paid families, the government offers support to other individuals, for example, the elderly and the incapacitated, who cannot work. During 1980 to 1999 Taiwanese government developed a program called National Health Insurance program. NHI mainly provides economically disadvantaged people with quality healthcare at an affordable price. July 1993, the government of Taiwan started giving a monthly sponsorship to elderly people. People beyond 65 years old whose normal family salary is not exactly, or equivalent to, 1.5 times the base monthly costs are fit to get a monthly sponsorship of $174. Private transfers also play an important role in Taiwan for antipoverty according to the date Taiwan provided to the Luxembourg Income Studies, the results indicates the private transfer has greater impact than public transfers in terms of proving welfare state.\n\nIn 1999, the government of Taiwan spent US$5.08 billion on social welfare projects and offered numerous sorts of assistance to people and families from low-pay sets. Notwithstanding money, assistance to get employment is given to the breadwinners in families, alongside educational guide for school-age children and well-being programs for women and children. In addition, there are additionally community associations, scholastic organizations, and private establishments arranged by government offices to help needy people. In principle, Taiwan is currently a liberal and elections based society. Hence social versatility ought to be the standard. Notably, as per an investigation of extra cash in Taiwan by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, families with the most astounding dispensable salaries number 2.6 people, while families with the least discretionary cash flow number 4.7 people. With rising costs of simple commodities and privatization of the training market, economically distraught families will end up in an undeniably hard position to educate their own children. However, this type of social welfare will significantly lower the Taiwan's revenue. Due to the slow economic development in the past years, this method will no longer close the income inequality or reduce the unemployment rate effectively in the future.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2301054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301054", "title": "Borderline hydrides", "text": "Borderline hydrides\n\nBorderline hydrides typically refer to hydrides formed of hydrogen and elements of the periodic table in group 11 and group 12 and indium (In) and thallium (Tl). These compounds have properties intermediate between covalent hydrides and saline hydrides. Hydrides are chemical compounds that contain a metal and hydrogen acting as a negative ion.\n\nBorderline hydrides exhibit bonding characteristics between ionic and covalent bond types. A specific examples of a borderline hydride CuH, copper hydride, that appears as a spongy reddish-brown substance is a moderate reducing agent. It will catalytically oxidize hypophosphorous acid to phosphorous acid at room temperature, and it gives off hydrogen gas when subjected to heat.\nZnH is also a solid at room temperature that breaks down at 90 °C, but even left alone decomposes over several days to zinc metal and hydrogen gas. Hydrogen telluride (HTe) and hydrogen selenide (HSe) are both borderline hydrides of high volatility that produce strong, unpleasant odors.\n\n\nBorderline hydrides are most commonly formed via the acidification or reduction of metal salts.\nFor instance, copper hydride is formed by reacting copper sulphate and hypophosphorous acid at about 70 °C, forming a yellow precipitate that soon turns red-brown.\nZinc hydride, ZnH, can be formed by the reduction of either a zinc halide or dimethylzinc.\n\nA more recent definition of borderline hydrides refers to hydrides that exist between classic and non-classic dihydrides. The classic form is the dihydride M(H) configuration, where the metal is bound to two free hydrogen atoms. The non-classic form contains two hydrogen atoms bound to a central metal atom with an η-H hapticity, indicating that a single coordination point on the metal atom bonds to two contiguous atoms from another molecule, in this case H. A well-known example of this is from the first such molecule to be synthesized with a coordinated hydrogen ligand (dihydrogen complex): W(CO)(PPri)(η-H).\nClassic dihydrides containing the dihydride M-(H) ligands are typically found as a tautomer with the non-classical dihydrogen complexes containing a M-(η-H) group.\n\nBorderline hydrides exist with a bond character somewhere between the classical and non-classical hydrides. Those that are thermally unstable exhibit stretching frequencies ν greater than 2150 cm as a result of poor electron donation from the metal center. An electron dense metal center will yield hydride with a ν less than 2060 cm, while anything between is considered to be in the borderline region. Kubas, et al. state that a stretching frequency of 2090 cm is within the bounds of stable H complexes while 2060 cm is right on the borderline between dihydrogen and dihydrides.\n"}

{"id": "2301060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301060", "title": "7 Faces of Dr. Lao", "text": "7 Faces of Dr. Lao\n\n7 Faces of Dr. Lao is a 1964 American Metrocolor fantasy-comedy film directed by George Pal (his final directorial effort) and starring Tony Randall. It is an adaptation of the 1935 fantasy novel \"The Circus of Dr. Lao\" by Charles G. Finney. It details the visit of a magical circus to a small town in the southwest United States, and the effects that visit has on the people of the town. The novel was adapted by Charles Beaumont.\n\nDr. Lao (Randall) rides a golden donkey into the small town of Abalone, Arizona and visits Edward Cunningham's newspaper to place a large ad for his traveling circus, which will play for two nights only.\n\nThough quiet, Abalone is not peaceful. Wealthy rancher Clinton Stark (Arthur O'Connell) has inside information that a railroad is coming to town and plans to buy the entire township while the land is cheap. Stark arrives at the newspaper offices to smugly confront Cunningham over a recent editorial in opposition to Stark's plan. Lao, patiently waiting to place his ad, silently listens to the meeting.\n\nAnother of Stark's opponents is Angela Benedict (Eden), a local widow who serves as librarian and schoolteacher. Cunningham is open about his affection for her, embarrassing her in a visit to the library to research Lao's background; she suppresses her reciprocal feelings.\n\nThat night, a town hall meeting is held in the library. Before the meeting, Stark quietly complains to the mayor that \"every time I bet on weakness, corruption and fallibility, I want to lose . . .but I always win.\" As the meeting progresses, Stark announces that its 16-mile long water supply pipe is decaying and would be too expensive to replace. He then offers to buy the entire town. Arguing against the offer, Cunningham introduces everyone to George G. George, a Navajo Indian who lives in \"another city, close to our own\", and points out that the lives of its residents depend on Abalone's continued existence.\n\nStark reluctantly allows the townspeople to ponder their choice \"until Friday night\" and the meeting is adjourned.\n\nThe next day, Cunningham visits the circus site, encountering the Abominable Snowman and Merlin, the fabled magician. Cunningham confronts Lao with the fact that Lao's alleged hometown vanished centuries before. Lao deflects Cunningham's questions, about himself and the large circus, which arrived without wagons and announces that he is \"a major mystery!\" The newspaperman \"leaves in a cloud of befuddlement,\" but accepting that Lao is \"a nice guy.\"\n\nLater, as Lao puts up posters advertising his circus, Angela's young son Mike learns that the mysterious wanderer is 7,321 years old. Mike takes this statement, as well as Lao's displays of extra-human capabilities, without doubt.\n\nThe circus opens and is attended by the entire town. Lao uses his many faces to offer his wisdom to the visitors, only some of whom heed the advice. Angela Benedict is fascinated by a sensuous and seductive dance of Pan, the God of Joy, who wears the face of Cunningham. Stark visits The Great Serpent, who points out that Stark is himself in a form of \"cage.\" Medusa turns the disbelieving Kate Lindquist to stone; her long-suffering husband excuses this by claiming it to be an \"arthritis attack . . .she's had them before.\" Lao calls an end to the proceedings as the guests flee, then Merlin appears, restoring the woman to life, her experience causing a much-needed reformation in her character.\n\nLater that night, Mike visits Lao and tries to get a job, displaying his novice juggling and conjuring skills. Lao instead offers some advice and observations about the world, which Mike doesn't understand, and Lao claims to not understand either.\n\nDuring the evening's presentation, Stark's henchmen had destroyed the newspaper office; this is discovered by Cunningham and his assistant, who go off to become drunk, as Lao stands in the nearby shadows.\n\nAngela is kept awake that night, plagued by the music that Pan had played, while nobody else can hear it.\n\nAt dawn, intoxicated, the newspapermen are astonished to discover that their office has been fully restored and the press is operating. Attributing it to Lao, they rush to produce a short edition of the paper, which Cunningham personally delivers to Stark in the morning. When he visits the circus site, Lao offers encouragement and calls on Cunningham to keep faith.\n\nThat evening, Lao stages his grand finale, a magic lantern show in which the mythical city of \"Woldercan,\" populated by doubles of the townfolk, is destroyed when it succumbs to temptation. The show ends in explosions and darkness and the townsfolk find themselves again in the library and in a town meeting. The vote is called on Stark's proposal, and to the surprise of Cunningham, Benedict and Stark it is rejected unanimously. A redeemed Stark tells them about the coming railroad. Angela confesses her love to Cunningham, to the delight of her mother-in-law.\n\nStark's henchmen are confused by their boss' apparent change of character and decide to trash Lao's circus in a drunken spree, during which they break Lao's fishbowl. The inhabitant is revealed to be the Loch Ness Monster, which balloons to enormous size when exposed to the open air. After it chases the two thugs away (and temporarily grows seven heads to resemble the seven faces of the inhabitants of the circus), Mike alerts Dr. Lao and then helps conjure up a cloudburst to wet and shrink the beast back to its original size.\n\nMorning comes and the circus is gone, leaving a red-colored circle on the desert floor where the tent had been. Mike's reports of the night before are initially disbelieved, until Stark finds the hat belonging to one of the henchmen. As Stark, Cunningham and Benedict wonder about the events, Mike chases after a dust plume, which he thinks is made by Lao. He only finds three wooden balls, which he expertly juggles, while calling on the absent Lao to see.\n\nThe closing scene shows the disappearing Dr. Lao riding his donkey over a nearby rise as his voice-over repeats his advice to Mike from two nights earlier, reminding Mike that the Circus of Dr. Lao is life itself, and everything in it is a wonder.\n\n\n\"*\" Randall voices the Serpent, a stop-motion animated snake which has the face of O'Connell.\n\n\"**\" While Randall is credited as the Abominable Snowman, bodybuilder Péter Pál (son of the film's director) was the (uncredited) body double. Randall also has a cameo appearance, wearing his own face, as a silent audience member.\n\nThe trailer shows date of the picture, in Roman numerals, as 1963 rather than 1964.\n\nAccording to notes on the Leigh Harline soundtrack CD released by \"Film Score Monthly,\" Pal's first choice for the role was Peter Sellers who was strongly interested in the role. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer decided that they wished an American in the lead role.\n\nWilliam Tuttle received an honorary Oscar for his makeup work on this film. It was the first of only two honorary Oscars awarded for makeup; the other went to John Chambers in 1968 for \"Planet of the Apes\". As part of Tuttle's work, Randall had his head shaved, not only to play the bald Dr. Lao, but also to make it convenient for the \"appliances\" he had to wear. Randall later said, \"It gave me an unborn look.\" The studio publicity department arrived at the barber too late to photograph the process, so they had a make-up artist glue hair back on Randall's head and the barber once again removed it, this time for the cameras. Randall makes a cameo appearance in the film, sans makeup, during the parade of cast members before the Woldercan sequence, sitting in the audience. Since his head was already shaved, makeup artist Tuttle applied a hairpiece to him. Randall later said in an interview, \"Gene Kelly's old toupee came in handy.\"\n\nJim Danforth's model animation of the Loch Ness Monster, the Giant Serpent, Medusa's snake hair were nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe \"Woldercan spectacular\" that Dr. Lao presents as the grand finale of his circus contains much footage from an earlier George Pal production, 1961's \"Atlantis, the Lost Continent\" as well as some footage of flowing lava from \"The Time Machine\" and stock footage of destruction from MGM's 1951 production of \"Quo Vadis\".\n\nThe crystal ball and large hourglass used by the Wicked Witch of the West in 1939's \"The Wizard of Oz\" can both be spotted in the film. Also, in the scene where Mike visits Lao at night, a two-headed tortoise can be seen; this made a few later appearances in the television series \"The Addams Family\".\n\n\"7 Faces of Dr. Lao\" was released on a region-free DVD as part of the Warner Bros. Archive Collection in November 2011.\n\n\"7 Faces of Dr. Lao\" garnered positive reception from multiple movie critics. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 100% of six surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10. Howard Thompson of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"heavy, thick, pint-sized fantasy, laid on with an anvil\".\n\n\n"}

Ertegun married Emine Hayrünnisa Rüstem in 1917 and the couple had three children, two of whom were Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegun, the brothers who founded Atlantic Records and became iconic figures in the American music industry.\n\nBorn in Constantinople to a civil servant father, Mehmet Cemil Bey, and a mother Ayşe Hamide Hanım, who was a daughter of Sufi shaykh İbrahim Edhem Efendi, he studied law at Darülfünûn-u Şahâne (دار الفنون شهانه), now Istanbul University, and graduated in 1908. He was a legal counsel for the Ottoman Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when he saw the birth of his first son, Nesuhi, on 26 November 1917, in Constantinople (now Istanbul), during the First World War. Taking part in an Ottoman delegation with a mission to search reconciliation with the Nationalists in Ankara, by the end of 1920, changed his destiny. While the two Ottoman Ministers heading the delegation returned to Istanbul after not achieving an understanding with the revolutionaries led by Mustafa Kemal Pasha he chose to join the National Struggle and remained in Ankara, leaving behind his young wife and three-year-old son, Nesuhi. He became an aide to Mustafa Kemal during the Turkish War of Independence and the chief legal counsel of the Turkish delegation to the resulting Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.\n\nAfter the Western powers recognized the newly founded Republic of Turkey in 1923, he was sent to Geneva to the League of Nations as an observer for the Turkish Republic. During this assignment, he frequently went to Paris for the Ottoman public debt negotiations. Following this posting to the League of Nations, he was appointed ambassador to Switzerland (1925–1930), France (1930–1932), the United Kingdom (1932–1934) and the United States (1934–1944). As the Republic's ambassador to Washington, Ertegun opened his embassy’s parlors to African American jazz musicians, who gathered there to play freely in a socio-historical context which was deeply divided by racial segregation at the time. Ambassador Ertegun became the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in May 1944. He held this last post until he died in Washington, D.C., of a heart attack in November of the same year. In April 1946, a year after World War II had ended, his body was carried back to Istanbul by the USS \"Missouri\" and buried in the garden of Sufi tekke, in Sultantepe, Üsküdar. near his shaykh grandfather İbrahim Edhem Efendi, who was once the head of the Tekke. (His two sons Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegun also rest there.) \n\nWhen Ertegun died, there was not yet a mosque in Washington, D.C., at which his funeral could be held.

In 1815, he and his brother Carlo accompanied their father, who had been identified with Murat's cause, into exile, and settled at Florence. In 1818, they were allowed to return to Naples, and on the proclamation of the constitution in 1820, the Poerios were among the stoutest defenders of the newly-won freedom. Alessandro fought as a volunteer under General Guglielmo Pepe against the Austrians in 1821, but when the latter reoccupied Naples and the king abolished the constitution, the family was again exiled and settled at Graz. \n\nAlessandro devoted himself to study in various German universities, and at Weimar, he became the friend of Goethe. In 1835, the Poerios returned to Naples, and Alessandro, while practising law with his father, published a number of lyrics. In 1848, he accompanied Pepe as a volunteer to fight the Austrians in northern Italy, and on the recall of the Neapolitan contingent Alessancho followed Pepe to Venice and displayed great bravery during the siege. Severely wounded in the fighting round Mestre, he died of his injuries. \n\nHis poetry reveals the idealism of a tender and delicate mind which was diligent in storing up sensations and images that for others would have been at most the transient impressions of a moment.

The NC formats were originally designed by CNC drill and route machine vendors as proprietary input formats for their equipment, and are known under their company name: Excellon, Hitachi, Sieb & Meyer, Posalux, etc. These formats are similar as they are based on RS-274-C and related to G-code. In 1985 IPC published a generic standard NC format, IPC-NC-349. Later XNC was designed, a simple strict subset of IPC-NC-349, designed not for driving machines but for exchanging drill information between CAD and CAM. They are collectively referred to as (PCB) NC files.\n\nThe NC files are primarily used to drive CNC machines, and they are adequate for that task. \n\nThey are also used to exchange design information between CAD and CAM, for which they are \"not\" adequate: essential information such as plating and drill span is missing. Furthermore, the NC output in CAD systems is often poorly implemented, resulting in poor registration between drill holes and copper layers and other problems. To exchange date between CAD and CAM it is more preferred to use the Gerber format. The quality of the Gerber file output software is typically good, and Gerber supports attributes to transfer meta-information such as plating and span.\nThe IPC-NC-349 format is the only IPC standard governing drill and routing formats. XNC is a strict subset of IPC-NC-349, Excellon a big superset. Many indefinite NC files pick some elements of the IPC standard.\n\nA digital rights managed copy of the specification is available from the IPC website, for a fee. It is targeted at input for drill/rout machines, not CAD to CAM data exchange.\n\nThe XNC format is strict subset of the IPC-NC-349 specification targeted at data exchange between CAD and CAM. The name XNC format stands for Exchange NC format. As a strict subset, it is highly compatible with existing software. Its purpose is to address the current chaos of different subsets and incomplete NC files, and define a simple common standard.\nThe XNC subset was defined by a consortium formed by Graphicode, Ucamco, KiCad and Pentalogix. \n\nThe specification is freely available among others at the Ucamco download page. The specification is brief, detailed, easy to understand and unambiguous. It is targeted at CAD to CAM data exchange, not at input for drill/rout machines.\n\nAn example:\n\nThe name Excellon format is derived from the company Excellon Automation (not to be confused with Excellon Software), which was the market leader in PCB drilling and routing machines during the 1980s, and whose proprietary format became widely used.\n\nThere are actually two Excellon formats, the older Excellon 1 and Excellon 2. Excellon 2 is a superset of IPC-NC-349. Commands from both are sometimes confusingly mixed in the same file.\n\nExcellon Automation stopped publishing the specification of its format, without statement on the IP and usage rights of the format. An archived copy exists. The specification is ambiguous, leading to different interpretations, especially in the area of coordinates and units. It is targeted at input for drill/rout machines, not CAD to CAM data exchange.\n\nFor CAD/CAM data exchange often NC files are used that do not conform to any specification. These files contain a few IPC-NC-349 commands, but follow neither the Excellon nor the IPC-NC-349 specification. Commands are not used properly, or are used in a syntactically incorrect way, and binary data objects may be included. Sometimes the historic EIA or EBCDIC character encoding is used. Usually the header is incomplete: the scale or the tool diameters is missing. Sometimes there is no header at all, and the file only contains tool numbers, with an unspecified diameter, and X,Y coordinates, in an unspecified unit. They are often called Excellon files although they are undefinite NC files. No specification exists.\n\nAn example:\n\nThe tool diameters and how to interpret the coordinates is not specified. This file is meaningless without additional information, typically put in a free format human readable \"tool\" file. This information must be re-entered manually by the CAD/CAM operator, with unnecessary manual labor and risk of delays or errors. Astonishingly, such enigmatic files are still used.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301107", "title": "Chicago Golf Club", "text": "Chicago Golf Club\n\nChicago Golf Club is a private golf club in the central United States, located in Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb west of Chicago. The oldest 18-hole course in North America, it was one of the five founding clubs of the United States Golf Association (USGA) in 1894.\n\nThe club has hosted several prominent events, including multiple U.S. Opens and Walker Cups, and was founded by renowned course designer and World Golf Hall of Fame member Charles B. Macdonald. In July 2018, the club hosted the inaugural U.S. Senior Women's Open, the newly created 14th USGA national championship.\n\nKnown as the \"Father of Golf\" in Chicago, Macdonald went to college in Scotland at the University of St Andrews, where he learned to play the game. He brought back a set of clubs, and in early 1888, on the Lake Forest estate of a friend, C.B. Farwell, and his son-in-law, Hobart Chatfield-Taylor, laid out seven informal golf holes on an interesting piece of lakefront property known as \"Bluff's Edge.\" His group of friends were fascinated by the new game and demanded a course be built on a dedicated site. In late spring of 1892, Macdonald passed around a hat with his friends, who contributed $10 each for a total of two or three hundred dollars. Macdonald spent that money in laying out a nine-hole course, about west of Chicago's Union Station, on the stock farm of A. Haddow Smith at Belmont, located one block north of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad line. This was to become the first golf course built west of the Alleghenies, and second to Shinnecock Hills in Long Island, New York, which opened 12 holes in 1891.\n\nWith contacts in Scotland, Macdonald next cabled the Royal Liverpool Golf Club and ordered six sets of clubs. As soon as they arrived, his newfound associates were soon bitten by the golf bug.\n\nThe first American woman to win an Olympic event, Margaret Abbott, was a member at the Chicago Golf Club in the 1890s.\n\nIn the spring of 1893, Macdonald wrote in his c. 1925 book \"Scotland's Gift – Golf\", that he increased the number of holes at Belmont to 18, creating the first 18-hole golf course in North America. On July 18, 1893, the charter was granted for the \"Chicago Golf Club\". \n\nThe club became so popular that, in 1894, the members bought a piece of property to build an improved 18-hole course. They purchased a parcel of the Patrick farm in Wheaton, for a complete sum totaling $28,000, which became \"a first class 18-hole course of 6,500 yards.\" The site was chosen because of its vast rolling hills covered with native grasses, which reminded Macdonald of Scotland.\n\nMacdonald designed the links-style layout himself; since he was a chronic slicer, he routed the holes so that both nines would play in a clockwise fashion so that he would stay out of trouble. Once the private land adjacent to the course became developed, a new rule was needed for errant golf balls leaving the premises. The United States Golf Association Rule of Golf for \"Out Of Bounds\" (27-1) had its origin at Chicago Golf Club.\n\nOssian Cole Simonds was commissioned to design the landscape architecture for the course at the Wheaton property in 1894. O.C. Simonds went on to do the landscape architecture for many famous Chicago properties including Lincoln Park, the Morton Arboretum and other golf courses including the Glen View Golf Club in 1897.\n\nThe Chicago clubhouse was designed by renowned Chicago architect Jarvis Hunt.\n\nAround 1902, the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad constructed an electrified third-rail railroad between the far western terminus of the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad at 52nd Avenue (now Laramie Avenue) in Chicago, and the Fox River towns of Aurora and Elgin. The branch line splitting to Aurora from downtown Wheaton traveled just past the main entrance to Chicago Golf Club, where was built a splendid brick station. A large majority of the club members commuted from downtown Chicago, and on weekends and special occasions a luxuriously appointed wood-paneled club car with a well-stocked bar and linen tablecloth dinner service was employed to ferry golfers out to the Chicago Golf Club. At the club's station was a siding, where the club car was parked until it was needed for the evening return trip.\n\nMacdonald also brought the Foulis brothers to Chicago from St Andrews, Scotland, to help grow the new game. The Foulis' father, James Foulis, Sr., worked as a foreman in the clubmaking shop of the legendary Old Tom Morris -- which was located across the street from the Old Course at St Andrews. Macdonald invited Robert Foulis to be the first club professional at Chicago Golf, but, as he was already under contract at a separate club, he passed the offer to his brother, James Foulis, who became the golf professional at Chicago Golf in 1895; he had worked for both Old Tom Morris and clubmaker Robert Forgan. \n\nIn 1905, Jim was succeeded by his brother David Foulis, who stayed at the Wheaton course until 1916. In addition to their skills as golf professionals, clubmakers and players, they were responsible for many innovations to the game of golf. They were first to apply the bramble (reverse-dimple) pattern on the cover of Coburn Haskell's new rubber-cored wound golf ball, and in response to the demands of the new ball developed the \"mashie-niblick\", the modern 7-iron, which fell between the traditional mashie (5-iron) and niblick (9-iron). Jim and Dave also designed many golf courses, most of which still exist today. While at Chicago Golf, Dave brought the metal hole-liner to the U.S. from Scotland and improved the design to hold the flagstick upright, even in the wind. Another brother, John, was a ballmaker and bookkeeper at the club until his death in 1907. \n\nAfter the Chicago Golf Club vacated the Belmont location, Herbert J. Tweedie, a one-time member of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, formed the Belmont Golf Club, of which the charter was granted in 1899. By that time, however, the course was back to nine holes. The original site has remained a golf course through the years, passing through several owners, and now is owned and operated as a public facility by the Downers Grove Park District.\n\nChicago Golf Club is ranked the fifth-most exclusive in the world. There are only 120 members and it will never exceed this amount, the only way to get in is by invitation from a member.\n\nCurrent members include Cleveland Golf founder Roger Cleveland, former ServiceMaster chief executive Jonathan P. Ward, actor Chris O'Donnell, former ServiceMaster vice chairman Charles Stair and former Amoco chairman H. Laurence Fuller. Two-time Masters champion Ben Crenshaw is a non-resident member, and recently deceased members include radio great Paul Harvey and International Harvester scion Brooks McCormick. Club President Bob King (1990–1991) led the process which allowed African Americans and women to be admitted as members of the club. Despite being in close proximity to multiple all-male clubs, Chicago Golf Club began admitting female members in the 1890s. Chicago Golf Club admitted its first African-American member, Charles Thurston, in 1993. \n\"(History collected from Chicagoland Golf magazine, April 1992, by Phil Kosin)\"\n\nThe 1897 Open was the first tournament hosted at Charles Blair MacDonald's club as well as the first championship west of the Appalachia. Macdonald ended up losing the championship on his home turf in the semifinals to W. Rosstier Betts. The actual open championship was played over 36 holes in one day between the semifinals and finals of the Amateur championship and was won by Scotsman Joe Lloyd with a score of 162. Local club professional James Foulis finished in third place two shots behind Lloyd. Eventual Amateur champion H.J. Wigham finished as the low amateur in a tie for eighth.\n\nThe 1900 Open was the sole USGA Championship won by Englishman Harry Vardon, who is regarded by many to be one of the greatest players of all time. Vardon competed in the championship after finishing a 90 match tour of the United States and Canada. He won the Open by two strokes over Englishman J.H. Taylor\n\nThe 1911 Open was the first of back to back championships won by John McDermott. This came following a defeat in a playoff in the 1910 U.S. Open in his hometown of Philadelphia. McDermott was the first American to win the Championship, and to this day is the youngest ever to win the U.S. Open at 19 years of age. McDermott won in a playoff over Mike Brady and Chicago Golf Club member George Simpson. He would go on to successfully defend his title the following year.\n\nThe 1928 Walker Cup was the first championship played across the newly designed Seth Raynor course at Chicago Golf Club. The American team crushed their GB&I foes 11 to 1. The team is widely regarded as one of the greatest Walker Cup teams of all time, having a combined 6 U.S. Open and 12 U.S. Amateur Championships among the eight of them. The team featured superstars such as Bobby Jones, Francis Ouimet, and Chick Evans\n\nThe 2018 Senior Women's Open was the inaugural edition of the championship. \n\nNotable events at Chicago Golf Club:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1893, it hosted both the first U.S. Amateur Championship and the first U.S. Open in 1895.\n\nTheodore Havemeyer, a wealthy sportsman whose family owned the American Sugar Company, played the game of golf on a trip to Pau in the south of France in 1889 and returned to his summer home in Newport excited about its future. In 1890, he and his friends rented some property on the old Castle Hill Farm and played golf on a primitive course. He convinced a few pals from the summer colony's social elite, men such as John Jacob Astor IV, Perry Belmont, and - to purchase the Rocky Farm property for $80,000 and establish the golf club in 1893.\n\nAt the time of the club's founding, Newport was at the peak of its prestige as the favorite summer colony of America's wealthy elite. The city had thus established one of America's earliest golf clubs since the sport was played almost exclusively by the rich when it was first introduced to the United States. The primitive course that they played upon in 1890 was bought roughly thirty years later and is now the site of seven holes (2–8) of the front nine.\n\nAnxious to host national competitions, Havemeyer invited the country's best amateurs to his new course for a championship in 1894. That December, Havemeyer held a meeting at New York City's Calumet Club with representatives from four other clubs: St. Andrew's Golf Club in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY; Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton on Long Island, New York; The Country Club in Brookline, MA; and the Chicago Golf Club. These clubs agreed to form the Amateur Golf Association, the forerunner of the United States Golf Association (USGA).\n\nIn October 1895, Newport Country Club hosted both the first U.S. Amateur Championship and the first U.S. Open. To this day, the U.S. Amateur champion is awarded the Havemeyer Trophy.\n\nIn celebration of the centennial of those first two USGA events, the club hosted the U.S. Amateur in 1995, won by defending champion Tiger Woods. Eleven years later, it was the site of the U.S. Women's Open in 2006, won by Annika Sörenstam in an 18-hole In 2017, the USGA announced Newport will host the 41st U.S. Senior Open in June 2020.\n\nThe Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County has annually held a fundraiser tournament at Newport Country Club.\n\nWhitney Warren designed the classic, Beaux Arts style clubhouse on a largely barren farm overlooking Brenton Point in 1895. Warren's only other major Newport project at the time was a home for his sister, Edith. This mansion, which overlooks Bailey's Beach and completed in 1900, was called High Tide. Michelle Wie stayed here for the week of the 2006 U.S. Women's Open. The clubhouse went under extensive renovation in 2005.\n\nThe original nine-hole course was designed in 1894 by William F. Davis, the club's first professional, and later expanded to 18 holes in 1899, again by Davis. This second nine was long thought to be designed by Donald Ross, but a recent discovery (2013) of an original scorecard (1899) rebuked Ross' work. This information is in the recently written club history.\n\nA. W. Tillinghast, famous for such designs as Winged Foot, Baltusrol, Bethpage Black, and the San Francisco Golf Club, was hired in 1923 to remodel the course layout. Since 1995, restoration on some of the course has been completed by Ron Forse.\n\n"}

It community is located approximately southeast of Cardston, which is home to Cardston County's municipal office.\n\nThe community itself has no government such as a mayor or councillors. It is administered by the Cardston County.\n\nOne of Jefferson's two services at this point in time is an unmanned postal box outlet (Rural Route 2 Site 10). It shares the same postal code as Cardston (T0K 0K0), and in fact, mail going to the Jefferson area is addressed to Cardston - as Jefferson-bound mail is sorted at Cardston - then delivered to Jefferson by Canada Post on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. There is a new Canada Post box installment after the old, green one was covered by debris when the neighboring abandoned Jefferson Garage collapsed in a windstorm in 2003.\n\nThe garage had been abandoned for generations and the wooden structure had seemed to be on the verge of collapse for years. The now-flattened garage had been beside an old General Store, but that store was converted into a family home generations ago.\n\nThe other service for the community is the Jefferson Waste Transfer Site, constructed in the 1980s to replace an old open-air dump that was located in a small gully two miles west of Jefferson. The newer Waste Transfer Site is located only about a quarter-mile east of Jefferson, and is manned only one day a week.\n\nThe newer waste site is much stricter than the old one, where anything up to old cars were left behind. The new site requires certain treatment of the waste before dumping it in the building, where it is later pushed off into a dump truck waiting in a passageway below. Many items are not allowed to be dumped at all anymore.\n\nThis modernization of waste treatment in rural communities seems to have occurred in many regions of Alberta, as identical facilities can be seen elsewhere.\n\nThere was a community hall (which used to be the Jefferson School in the mid 1900s), but it fell into disuse and disrepair in the 1990s. The main problem was roof leaks that ruined the hardwood gym floor. Prior to this, it had been used for community dances and 4-H functions such as public speaking competitions. By 2007, sadly, it was broken into and vandalized by unknown culprits and internal destruction was of such a scale that it was condemned. After being scheduled to be demolished, it was burned to the ground on April 24, 2007.\n\nThe Jefferson 4-H Beef Club seems to have disappeared, also during the 1990s, and been absorbed by the Chinook 4-H Club in Cardston. This is probably due to many of the 4-H aged youth growing up and moving on, with not enough younger club members to replace them.\n\nJefferson used to have its own Alberta Wheat Pool elevator and had a railroad going through it. However, as a result of Alberta removing its lesser-used rail lines, the railway going through Jefferson (from east of Cardston south to Jefferson, then east to Whiskey Gap, Alberta) was torn up in the early 1980s. The grain elevator was torn down when the province began consolidating its grain processing in larger centers.\n\n\n"}

Jacobs\n\nJack Howard Jacobs (born August 2, 1945) is a retired colonel in the United States Army and a Medal of Honor recipient for his actions during the Vietnam War. He currently serves as a military analyst for NBC News and MSNBC and previously worked as an investment manager.\n\nBorn on August 2, 1945, in Brooklyn, New York, Jacobs lived in Queens near LaGuardia Airport. He was born into a Jewish family with origins in Greece, Poland, and Romania. As a child, he moved with his family to Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, in the mid-1950s and in 1962 graduated from Woodbridge High School.\n\nHe then attended Rutgers University, where he earned both Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees. A member of the school's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps program, he entered military service as a first lieutenant in 1966.\n\nIn the course of his military career, he served as a platoon leader in the 82nd Airborne Division, a battalion executive officer in the 7th Infantry Division (United States), and a battalion commander with the 10th Infantry Regiment in Panama. He spent two tours of duty in Vietnam, both times as an advisor to infantry units in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN).\n\nIn his first deployment to Vietnam, Jacobs served as a first lieutenant with Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, in Kien Phong Province, part of the Mekong Delta region. By March 9, 1968, he was working as the assistant battalion advisor for the ARVN's 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. During a mission on that day, 2nd Battalion came under intense fire from an entrenched Viet Cong force. As Jacobs called in air support from his position with the leading company, the company commander was disabled and the unit became disorganized due to heavy casualties.\n\nAlthough wounded himself by mortar fragments to the head and arms, Jacobs took command of the company and ordered a withdrawal and the establishment of a defense line at a more secure position. Despite impaired vision caused by his injuries, he repeatedly ran across open rice paddies through heavy fire to evacuate the wounded, personally saving a fellow advisor, the wounded company commander, and twelve other allied soldiers. Three times during these trips he encountered Viet Cong squads, which he single-handedly dispersed. He was subsequently promoted to captain and awarded the Medal of Honor. The medal was formally presented to him by President Richard Nixon.\n\nIn addition to the Medal of Honor, Jacobs received two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts.\n\nIn his memoir, Jacobs recounts that he had to use subterfuge to return to a combat role in Vietnam after being awarded the Medal of Honor, as the military was unwilling to assign Medal of Honor recipients to combat roles.\n\nJacobs was a faculty member at the United States Military Academy in West Point, teaching international relations and comparative politics for three years, from 1973 to 1976, and at the National War College in Washington, D.C. He retired from the Army in 1987 as a colonel.\n\nAfter his military retirement, Jacobs began a career in investment banking. He founded and was chief operating officer of AutoFinance Group, Inc., which dealt in the securitization of debt instruments. The company was later sold to KeyBank. He next worked as a managing director of Bankers Trust, overseeing the firm's foreign exchange options and being involved in the institutional hedge fund business until leaving the company in 1996. Jacobs is a principal in The Fitzroy Group, an investment and residential real estate development organization which operates in London. He is also on the board of directors for several smaller corporations.\n\nJacobs maintains involvement in several military-related organizations. He is vice chairman of the Medal of Honor Foundation, a member of the board of trustees for the National World War II Museum, and holds the McDermott Chair of Politics at the U.S. Military Academy.\n\nIn October 2008, the Penguin Group published Jacobs' memoir, \"If Not Now, When?: Duty and Sacrifice In America's Time of Need,\" coauthored with \"New York Times\" best-selling author, Douglas Century, with a foreword by \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor and managing editor Brian Williams. The book won the 2010 Colby Award, recognizing a \"first work of fiction or nonfiction that has made a significant contribution to the public's understanding of intelligence operations, military history, or international affairs.\"\n\nIn May 2012, Thomas Dunne Books published Jacobs' \"Basic: Surviving Boot Camp and Basic Training\", co-written with David Fisher. The book is a history of the American military's basic training told mainly through oral histories of those who have gone through Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force initial training.\n\nHe is also a military analyst for NBC/MSNBC. In 2009, he appeared on The Colbert Report as part of the Doom Bunker segment.\n\nHe currently serves on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military service organization.\n\nJacobs is married to Sue Jacobs, has a grown daughter and two sons, and lives in Far Hills, New Jersey. He has also been a resident of the Millington section of Long Hill Township, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2016, Jacobs was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In 2018, Jacobs delivered the Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\n\nJacobs' Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Capt. Jacobs (then 1st Lt.), Infantry, distinguished himself while serving as assistant battalion advisor, 2d Battalion, 16th Infantry, 9th Infantry Division, Army . of the Republic of Vietnam. The 2d Battalion was advancing to contact when it came under intense heavy machine gun and mortar fire from a Viet Cong battalion positioned in well fortified bunkers. As the 2d Battalion deployed into attack formation its advance was halted by devastating fire. Capt. Jacobs, with the command element of the lead company, called for and directed air strikes on the enemy positions to facilitate a renewed attack. Due to the intensity of the enemy fire and heavy casualties to the command group, including the company commander, the attack stopped and the friendly troops became disorganized. Although wounded by mortar fragments, Capt. Jacobs assumed command of the allied company, ordered a withdrawal from the exposed position and established a defensive perimeter. Despite profuse bleeding from head wounds which impaired his vision, Capt. Jacobs, with complete disregard for his safety, returned under intense fire to evacuate a seriously wounded advisor to the safety of a wooded area where he administered lifesaving first aid. He then returned through heavy automatic weapons fire to evacuate the wounded company commander. Capt. Jacobs made repeated trips across the fire-swept open rice paddies evacuating wounded and their weapons. On 3 separate occasions, Capt. Jacobs contacted and drove off Viet Cong squads who were searching for allied wounded and weapons, single-handedly killing 3 and wounding several others. His gallant actions and extraordinary heroism saved the lives of 1 U.S. advisor and 13 allied soldiers. Through his effort the allied company was restored to an effective fighting unit and prevented defeat of the friendly forces by a strong and determined enemy. Capt. Jacobs, by his gallantry and bravery in action in the highest traditions of the military service, has reflected great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.\"\n\n\n"}

The bit has bit shanks, D-shaped rings, and a curb chain. Due to its shanks, it is regarded as a type of curb bit. The curb action is minimal to mild, however, because the shanks have short purchase arms and no lever arms (see Lever). Some variations increase the curb action. A Kimblewick is used with one set of reins.\n\nThis bit was originally called the Kimblewick after the English town where it first appeared. First invented by show jumper, horse man and family farmer, Felix Oliver (Aka Phil) \nMr Oliver & his family lived at Meadacre Farm, Kimblewick, and started a partnership with Harry Payne, from Bushey, that was to make his reputation with such great horses as Red Admiral, Red Star, Sheila, Galway Bay and Planet.\nMr. Oliver rode the horses himself at that time, including many winners of point-to-pointing.\nHis eldest son, Alan, began show jumping as a schoolboy and, schooled by his father, became one of the greatest names in top show jumping. With his second son, Paul, Mr. Oliver produced many successful ponies.\nHis daughter Vivien was also a very successful rider.\nIn 1967, after the death of Mr. Payne, he formed a partnership with Mr. Leonard Crawthraw.\nAfter his retirement from the farm in 1974 he lived in Longwick where he took immense pleasure in schooling and advising young riders.\n\nLike the pelham and curb bits in general, the Kimblewick has bit shanks with purchase arms. However, unlike these other bits, its shanks have no lever arm. Due to the purchase arm and geometry of the rings, the rings may function as very short lever arms and create a small amount of leverage, which puts this type of bit into the pelham or curb bit \"family\". The curb function varies with the style of bit: slotted Kimblewicks provide the option of more curb action, whereas unslotted Kimblewicks are very close in function to the Baucher bit, which most users regard as a snaffle bit, and to the pelham bit when the snaffle rein is used. \n\nDepending on the position of the rider's hands, the standard Kimblewick has different effects when the rein is allowed to slide freely along the curved portion of the D-ring. If the rider's hands are held high, there is no leverage effect. If the rider's hands are low, the slight leverage effect can be used. However, one popular design, the Uxeter Kimblewick, has slots in the curved portion of the ring, so that the rein may be fixed into one position. This increases the curb effect, especially when the rein is placed on the lower of the two slots. \n\nKimblewick bits have a variety of bit mouthpieces. The original design has a ported mouthpiece, but it now is also manufactured with others, including a solid, unjointed \"mullen\" mouth, and a single-jointed mouthpiece.\n\nKimblewicks are not as widely used as snaffles and pelhams, and are illegal in some horse show competition classes, notably dressage and show hunter. Kimblewicks are regarded by some people as unconventional or non-\"classic\", and the compromise design that combines snaffle and curb features may lead some horses to either overflex in the bit or learn to lean on it. However, they do offer the rider a slight curb effect without the risk of a shank getting caught on something, which is useful for contact sports, such as polocrosse, and provide a bit more control than a snaffle, which can be helpful for smaller riders on strong horses. They are seen commonly on ponies.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301179", "title": "Curb bit", "text": "Curb bit\n\nA curb bit is a type of bit used for riding horses that uses lever action. It includes the pelham bit and the Weymouth curb along with the traditional \"curb bit\" used mainly by Western riders. \n\nKimblewicks or \"Kimberwickes\" are modified curb bits, and a curb bit is used in a double bridle along with a bradoon. A curb bit is, in general, more severe than a basic snaffle bit, although there are several factors that are involved in determining a bit's severity. Liverpool bits are a type of curb bit commonly used for horses in harness.\n\nThe curb bit consists of a mouthpiece, curb chain, and a shank, with one ring on each side of the purchase arm of the shank, and one ring on the bottom of the lever arm of the shank. Pelham bits add a ring for a snaffle rein, next to the mouthpiece.\n\nA curb bit works on several parts of a horse's head and mouth. The bit mouthpiece acts on the bars, tongue and roof of the mouth. The shanks add leverage and place pressure on the poll via the crownpiece of the bridle, to the chin groove via the curb chain, and, especially with a \"loose jaw\" shank, may act on the sides of the mouth and jaw.\n\nA curb bit is a leverage bit, meaning that it multiplies the pressure applied by the rider. Unlike a snaffle bit, which applies direct rein pressure from the rider's hand to the horse's mouth, the curb can amplify rein pressure several times over, depending on the length of the curb's bit shank. Shank sizes vary from the Tom Thumb (2 inches long) to more than 5 inches. The longer the bit shank, the more powerful its potential effect on the horse. For this reason, overall shank or \"cheek\" length, from the top of the cheek ring to the bottom of the rein ring, usually cannot exceed inches for most horse show disciplines.\n\nThe relation of the upper shank (\"purchase\")—the shank length from the mouthpiece to the cheekpiece rings—and the lower shank or lever arm—the shank length from the mouthpiece to the lowest rein ring, is important in the severity of the bit. The standard curb bit has a \" purchase and a \" lower shank, thus producing a 1:3 ratio of purchase to lower shank, a 1:4 ratio of purchase to full shank, thus producing 3 lbs of pressure on the chin groove and 4 lbs of pressure on the horse's mouth for every 1 lb placed on the reins (3 and 4 newtons respectively for every newton). \n\nRegardless of the ratio, the longer the shank, the less force is needed on the reins to provide a given amount of pressure on the mouth. So, if one were to apply 1 lb of pressure on the horse's mouth, a 2\" shank would need more rein pressure than an 8\" shank to provide the same effect. \n\nA long lower shank in relation to the upper shank (or \"purchase\") increases the leverage, and thus the pressure, on the curb groove and the bars of the mouth. A long purchase in relation to the lower shank increases the pressure on the poll and chin, but does not apply as much pressure on the bars of the mouth. A longer purchase will also lift the cannons up and cause significant lip stretch, with an increased danger of dragging the cannons of the bit into the premolars.\n\nA horse has more warning or pre-signal, in a long-shanked bit, allowing it to respond before any significant pressure is applied to its mouth, than it would in a shorter-shanked bit, but ultimately it is the straightness or curve or the shank which translates to the abruptness of response. A straight shank, following the line of leverage, will produce a faster response in the mouth and curb than a shorter curved shank. In this way, a longer shank can allow better communication between horse and rider, without increasing severity. This is also directly dependent on the tightness of the curb chain. Pre-signal is everything that happens before the curbstrap engages, so a properly adjusted curbstrap is paramount in determining the amount of rotation and the timeframe a horse has to prepare for the bit to engage. Too tight and the action is abrupt and severe, too loose and the action is slower, but the bit rotates further, causing it to lift in the mouth and hit the premolars.\n\nShanks come in a variety of types, which may affect the action of the bit. Some shanks are loose-jawed, meaning they swivel where the mouthpiece attaches to the shank. Others have a loose, rotating ring at the bottom of the shank for rein attachment. Both of these functions allow slight rotation before the bit engages, again providing a \"warning\" to the horse before the bit engages fully and allowing him to respond to the slightest pressure, thus increasing communication between horse and rider.\n\nThe cheek-shank angle also varies, with some straight up and down, others with the shanks curving backward, and some with an S-curve in the shank. The straighter the cheek-shank line is, the less signal is provided to the horse before the bit engages. Those that curve backward provide more of a signal to the horse. Therefore, the type of shank needs to be considered according to the use of the horse. Horses that maintain a more vertical head position, such as dressage horses, generally use a curb bit with straight shanks. Those that have a nose-out head position when working, such as cutting and roping horses, more commonly use a curved shank.\n\nThe curb bit's mouthpiece controls the pressure on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and bars. A mullen mouth places even pressure on the bars and tongue. A port places more pressure on the bars, but provides room for the tongue. A high port may act on the roof of the mouth as it touches. Some Western style curbs, particularly the spade bit, have both a straight bar mouthpiece and a high welded port, thus acting on the bars, tongue and palate. In the wrong hands, such bits can be extremely severe, but on an exquisitely trained animal, they allow the rider to communicate with the horse with a simple touch of the fingertips to the reins.\n\nCurb bits can also be purchased with a variety of jointed mouthpieces that are sometimes mistakenly called \"snaffles\", some of which (like the twisted wire) can further increase severity. Jointed mouthpieces increase the pressure on the bars due to the nutcracker action of the mouthpiece. In addition, the joint angle is altered by the shank leverage to tip the bit downward and into the tongue. These bits, sometimes called \"cowboy snaffles\" due to their popularity among western riders, are actually more harsh than a curb with a simple, solid, ported mouthpiece.\n\nThe curb chain or strap applies pressure to the curb groove under a horse's chin. When the shank of the bit rotates back (due to rein pressure), the cheek of the bit rotates forward since it is a lever arm. The curb chain is attached to the rings at the end of the cheek. So as the cheek moves forward, it pulls the curb chain, tightening in the curb groove. Once it comes in contact with the curb groove of the horse it acts as a fulcrum, causing the cannons of the bit mouthpiece to push down onto the horse's bars, thus amplifying the bit's pressure on the bars of the horse's mouth.\n\nThe action of the bit is therefore also dependent on the tightness of the curb chain. If the bit is used without a curb chain (very uncommon—and dangerous), it loses its leverage action. If used with a loose curb chain, it allows the shanks to rotate more before the curb chain is tight enough to act as a fulcrum and exert pressure. This extra rotation can warn the horse before pressure is exerted on the mouth, so the well-trained horse may respond faster. If used with a very tight curb chain, the bit immediately exerts leverage and increased pressure on the bars as soon as pressure is applied to the reins. Therefore, a tight curb chain is harsher, and provides less finesse in signaling the horse than a looser curb chain would.\n\nLess often seen is the lip strap, a thin strap or light chain that helps keep the curb chain in place and also prevents the horse from grabbing, or \"lipping\" the bit shanks with its mouth.\n\nCurb bits have tremendous variation, from the relatively simple English Weymouth curb or the simple western medium-port curb to very elaborate designs with complex mouthpieces and shank designs. Some of the more common include:\n\n\nCurbs are generally placed lower down in a horse's mouth than snaffle bits, touching the corners of the mouth, or creating a single slight wrinkle in the lips. The lower the bit is placed, the more severe it is as the bars of the mouth get thinner and pressure is more concentrated.\n\nThe curb chain should be adjusted correctly, lying flat against the chin groove and only coming into action against the jaw when the shank is rotated, but not so loose that the shank exceeds 45 degrees of rotation.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301207", "title": "Ghost Town (Specials song)", "text": "Ghost Town (Specials song)\n\n\"Ghost Town\" is a song by the British two-tone band the Specials, released on 12 June 1981. The song spent three weeks at number one and 10 weeks in total in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. Addressing themes of urban decay, deindustrialisation, unemployment and violence in inner cities, the song is remembered for being a hit at the same time as riots were occurring in British cities. Internal tensions within the band were also coming to a head when the single was being recorded, resulting in the song being the last single recorded by the original seven members of the group before splitting up. However, the song was hailed by the contemporary UK music press as a major piece of popular social commentary, and all three of the major UK music magazines of the time awarded \"Ghost Town\" the accolade of \"Single of the Year\" for 1981.\n\nThe tour for the group's \"More Specials\" album in autumn 1980 had been a fraught experience: already tired from a long touring schedule and with several band members at odds with keyboardist and band leader Jerry Dammers over his decision to incorporate \"muzak\" keyboard sounds on the album, several of the gigs descended into audience violence. As they travelled around the country the band witnessed sights that summed up the depressed mood of a country gripped by recession. In 2002 Dammers told \"The Guardian\", \"You travelled from town to town and what was happening was terrible. In Liverpool, all the shops were shuttered up, everything was closing down ... We could actually see it by touring around. You could see that frustration and anger in the audience. In Glasgow, there were these little old ladies on the streets selling all their household goods, their cups and saucers. It was unbelievable. It was clear that something was very, very wrong.\"\n\nIn an interview in 2011, Dammers explained how witnessing this event inspired his composition:\n\nThe song's sparse lyrics address urban decay, unemployment and violence in inner cities. Jo-Ann Greene of Allmusic notes that the lyrics \"only brush on the causes for this apocalyptic vision—the closed down clubs, the numerous fights on the dancefloor, the spiraling unemployment, the anger building to explosive levels. But so embedded were these in the British psyche, that Dammers needed only a minimum of words to paint his picture.\" The club referred to in the song was the Locarno (run by the Mecca Leisure Group and later renamed Tiffanys), a regular haunt of Neville Staple and Lynval Golding, and which is also named as the club in \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\", one of the songs on the B-side. The building which housed the club is now Coventry Central Library.\n\nIn March 1981, Jerry Dammers heard the reggae song \"At the Club\" by actor and singer Victor Romero Evans played on \"Roundtable\", the singles review show on BBC Radio 1. Fascinated by the record's sound, Dammers telephoned the song's co-writer and producer John Collins a few days later, although as Dammers first phone call was in the middle of the night, Collins initially took it to be a joke. Following further conversations with Dammers, Collins travelled up from his home in London to meet the Specials at their rehearsal studio and agreed to produce their new single.\n\nAfter becoming overwhelmed with the multitude of choices available in the 24-track studio used during the recording of \"More Specials\", Dammers had decided that he wanted to return a more basic set-up, and after a recommendation from bass player Horace Panter who was familiar with the place, the band chose the small 8-track studio in the house owned by John Rivers in Woodbine Street in Royal Leamington Spa. The studio, which consisted of a recording space in the cellar and a control room in the living room, was too small to accommodate all the members of the band, so rather than their normal recording method of playing all together, Collins recorded each band member playing one at a time and built up the songs track by track.\n\nThe three songs for the single were recorded over ten days in April 1981 in two separate sessions at Woodbine Street: seven days from 3 to 9 April and then a further three days from 15 to 17 April. Tensions were high during the recording of the single, with little communication between the band members, and at one point a frustrated Roddy Byers kicked a hole in the studio door, angering Rivers. Panter remembered, \"Everybody was stood in different parts of this huge room with their equipment, no one talking. Jerry stormed out a couple of times virtually in tears and I went after him, 'Calm down, calm down'. It was hell to be around.\" Dammers said, \"People weren't cooperating. 'Ghost Town' wasn't a free-for-all jam session. Every little bit was worked out and composed, all the different parts, I'd been working on it for at least a year, trying out every conceivable chord ... I can remember walking out of a rehearsal in total despair because Neville would not try the ideas. You know the brass bit is kind of jazzy, it has a dischord? I remember Lynval rushing into the control room while they were doing it going, 'No, no, no, it sounds wrong! Wrong! Wrong!'\"\n\nCollins wanted the song to sound more like a Sly and Robbie roots reggae track, so he brought a copy of a Sly and Robbie-produced single, \"What a Feeling\" by Gregory Isaacs, to the studio so that drummer John Bradbury could mimic the drum sound. He also suggested the two-handed shuffle rhythm played by Dammers on the Hammond organ throughout the song. Using just eight tracks limited Collins' recording possibilities, but as a reggae producer he decided to use the common reggae method of recording everything in mono: \"As we were recording eight-track, I did go with a track plan. I wanted the drums in mono on one track, the bass in mono on another and the rhythm – that shuffle organ and Lynval's DI'd guitar – on another. They're the backbone of a reggae song. Then there was brass on another track, lead vocals on another, backing vocals on another, and various little bits and pieces dropped in ...'Ghost Town' is basically a mono record with stereo reverb and echo that I added in the mix ... The same applied to the brass: John [Rivers] put one mic in the middle of the room, placed Dick [Cuthell] and Rico [Rodriguez] in diagonal corners, and when we listened in the control room it sounded great. Recording simply in mono really helped the instruments balance themselves.\" However, there was a tense moment towards the end of recording when Dammers decided at the last minute that he wanted to add a flute to the song, and with no free tracks available Collins was forced to record the flute directly onto the track containing the previously recorded brass section, with the possibility that any error would have rendered the entire track unusable:\n\nAs it had not been decided where exactly the backing vocals would be used, Terry Hall, Staple, Golding and Dammers sang a full backing vocal track throughout the song, which Collins used to his advantage as the lyric \"this town is coming like a ghost town\" had become like a \"hypnotic chant\" by the end of the song.\n\nCollins took a recording of the separate tracks back to his home in Tottenham in north London where he spent three weeks mixing the song. During this period Hall, Staple, Golding and Dammers all turned up at the house at various times to add further vocals. Since the song had no proper beginning or ending during recording at Woodbine Street, Collins recreated the idea of fading in over a sound effect, which he had used previously on \"Lift Off\", the B-side of \"At the Club\". To achieve the effect he wanted, Collins utilised a kit-built Transcendent 2000 synthesiser to create a \"ghost\" sound, which he used to fade in and out at the beginning and end of the track.\n\nThe single had two B-sides, written by two different members of the Specials. \"Why?\" is a plea for racial tolerance and was written by guitarist Lynval Golding in response to a violent racist attack he had suffered in July 1980 outside the Moonlight Club in West Hampstead in London, which had left him hospitalised with broken ribs. \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\" was written by lead singer Terry Hall and describes a mundane night out in Coventry.\n\nThe video, directed by Barney Bubbles, consists of bass player Panter driving the band around London in a 1961 Vauxhall Cresta, intercut with views of streets and buildings filmed from the moving vehicle, and ends with a shot of the band standing on the banks of the River Thames at low tide. The video's locations include driving through the Rotherhithe Tunnel and around semi-derelict areas of the East End before ending up in the financial district of the City of London in the early hours of daylight on Sunday morning, where the streets were deserted as it was the weekend. The shots of the band in the car were achieved by attaching a camera to the bonnet using a rubber sucker: Panter recalled that at one point the camera fell off (briefly seen in the finished video at 1:18) and scratched the car's paintwork, to the displeasure of the car's owner. The original Ghost Town car can be seen (and sat in) at The Coventry Music Museum.\n\nContemporary reviews identified the song's impact as an \"instant musical editorial\" on recent events (the 1981 England riots). Although initial reviews of the single in the UK music press were lukewarm, by the end of the year the song had won over the critics to be named \"Single of the Year\" in \"Melody Maker\", \"NME\" and \"Sounds\", the UK's top three weekly music magazines at the time. AllMusic's review of the original single argued that the song was the band's \"crowning achievement\".\n\nThe summer of 1981 saw riots in over 35 locations around the UK. In response to the linking of the song to these events, singer Terry Hall said, \"When we recorded 'Ghost Town', we were talking about [1980]'s riots in Bristol and Brixton. The fact that it became popular when it did was just a weird coincidence.\" The song created resentment in Coventry where residents angrily rejected the characterisation of the city as a town in decline.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Paris, 15 August 1717 – d. Paris, 26 December 1806) was a French dramatist, painter, architect, set designer and author, and designer of one of the earliest examples of the French landscape garden, Parc Monceau in Paris. He also invented the \"transparent\", an early ancestor of the magic lantern and motion picture, for viewing moving bands of landscape paintings.\n\nCarmontelle came from a modest background; his father was a bootmaker. He studied drawing and geometry, and at the age of twenty three qualified for the title of engineer, and entered the service of the Duc de Chevreuse and the Duc de Luynes at the Château de Dampierre, where he taught drawing and mathematics to the children.\n\nIn 1758, he entered the service of the Comte Pons de Saint-Maurice, governor of the Duc de Chartres and commander of regiment of Orléans-dragons as a topographical engineer. In addition to his drawing duties, he wrote farces and tales. After 1763 entered into the service of Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans as a lecteur, responsible for providing theatrical performances for the family. He wrote and directed plays, decorated the scenery and made the costumes. In this way he invented a new genre of play, the \"proverbe dramatique\", a scene of light comedy designed to be a point of departure for a theatrical improvisation. He also wrote plays for the famous ballerina, Marie-Madeleine Guimard for performance at the private theater of her residence, Pantin.\n\nIn addition to his work in the theater, he was a talented artist, who made portraits in pen and watercolor in less than two hours of notable people that he met. The most famous of his drawings is that of the infant Mozart playing the clavier.\n\nIn 1773, he was asked by the Duc de Chartres, the son of Louis-Philippe d'Orléans and the future Philippe Egalité, to design a garden around a small house that he was building to the northwest of Paris. Between 1773 and 1778, he created the \"folie de Chartres\", (now Parc Monceau), one of the most famous French landscape gardens of the time. It departed from the more natural English landscape gardens of the time by presenting a series of fantastic scenes designed \"to unite in one garden all places and all times.\". It included a series of fabriques, or architectural structures, while illustrated all the styles known at the time; antiquity, exoticism, Chinese, Turkish, ruins, tombs, and rustic landscapes, all created to surprise and divert the visitor.\n\nAfter the death of the duc d'Orleans in 1785, Carmonetelle entered into the service of the Duc de Chartres, and taught drawing to his son Louis-Philippe of France, the future and last King of France, and his sister Adeleide .\n\nIn the last years of his life, he pioneered a new invention for showing paintings in motion, which was a distant ancestor of the motion picture. In 1783 he began working on what he termed \"décors transparents animés.\" These were paintings of landscapes on long bands of paper, fifty centimeters high and as many as forty two meters long. These were mounted on two wooden rollers in a box, with the light of day coming into the box from behind and passing through the paper. The landscapes were slowly rolled from one roll to the other, giving the illusion of a walk in the garden. The first moving landscapes he titled \"Landscapes of France,\" \"English Gardens,\" \"The Seasons,\" and \"The Banks of the Seine.\" One of the moving landscapes is preserved at the Museum of Sceaux.\n\n\n"}

It arose as a replacement for the outdated Diversi-Dial system (DDial). Like DDial, it was a multi-line modem system that originally could handle eight simultaneous connections (later updated to handle sixteen), and using custom-produced RS-232 serial boards had a theoretical connection limit of thirty-two on an IBM PC-AT - type computer (80286 processor). While DDial was limited to 300 baud, STS was initially capable of 2400 baud speeds (later editions upped this to 14.4, 19.2, and 28.8). Using internal software, one or more of these lines could be used to establish links to other STS stations, effectively making the number of simultaneous users dependent on how many STSes were involved.\n\nThe interface and design was similar to DDial in that users logged into the system with a three digit number that served as a username. Once logged in, the user could change his or her name to whatever he or she wished, while his or her user number served as a unique identifier. Each user was assigned a user level. 0 was for non-members. Callers without a user number could log in for only a limited time (usually 10 minutes, but this could be decreased to 5 when call volume was high.) The numbered levels were for registered users, usually paying members. The upper levels, 50-99 were for various levels of moderators. The sysop could assign a moderator level to any user, effectively giving them power to do various tasks such as creating specialty channels, making links to other STS stations, moderating lower-level users, and kicking out people who were being a nuisance, (one early feature added was used to ban \"nuisance\" guests from returning after they were kicked, using the then-recently emerging technology of caller ID).\n\nSynergy Teleconferencing System also incorporated other interesting features that predated similar ones offered by larger ISPs (internet service providers); One of which (introduced early on) was the ability to inform a user that had call waiting on their phone line that they had an incoming call and allow them the opportunity to answer the call and then return to their online session. This feature was built into the system long before other corporate service providers offered this feature.\n\nSTS was originally written in Pascal with assembly language \"hooks\" for driving the hardware. The earliest versions were functional on IBM PC-XT-type computers, while later versions required the more robust IBM PC-AT platform with the 80286 processor. Connection speed evolved over the life of the software; Version 2.0 of the software supported up to 28.8k directly. V1.5 and later also had a far superior network linking mode to that of Diversi-Dial that supported encrypted data communications and would use IRC as a \"hub\" to link multiple systems without tying up more than one phone line per station. The software was produced by the Florida company \"Lightspeed Electronics LLC.\", which began producing early hard disk drive systems for PCs in the early 1980s. The primany (\"flagship\") station, STS-01, was called Fantasia, the successor to a D-Dial of the same name. The system was run by Falkor and the software and hardware was designed and produced by him as well as his CoSysOps Sloth, Creidiki, Troubadour and Trillian.\n\nSTS 07 Information Overload is back up and running currently 8 lines until we find a 486 without a riser card to support 16 lines if anyone would like to donate one they have that would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTelnet address is 154.20.6.193 (will be adding a dyndns hostname soon and setting up a webpage with embedded telnet client)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synergy_Teleconferencing_System&action=edit&section=3\n"}

{"id": "2301234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301234", "title": "Deutschland sucht den Superstar", "text": "Deutschland sucht den Superstar\n\nDeutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS; \"Germany seeks the superstar\") is a German reality talent show. Part of the \"Idol\" franchise, it was created by British media mogul Simon Fuller as a spin-off from the British show \"Pop Idol\", of which two series were broadcast between the years of 2001 and 2003. Debuting to mediocre ratings in November 2002 on the RTL network, the show has since become one of the most successful shows on German television.\n\nThe program aims to discover the best singer in the country through a series of nationwide auditions in which viewer voting determines the winner. Voting is done through telephone and SMS text voting.\n\nThe first season 2002–2003 of \"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\" debuted without much hype in November 2002 on the \nRTL network. The show's co-hosts were Swiss actress Michelle Hunziker and former soap opera actor , while the jury consisted of music producer Dieter Bohlen, radio host , British music journalist Shona Fraser, and then-president of BMG Germany, . Through word of mouth generated by the appeal of its contestants and the presence of Bohlen's acid-tongued commentary, the show grew into a phenomenon ending with a finale viewed by an estimated twelve million viewers in March 2003.\n\nBesides Klaws, all ten finalists with the exception of then-pregnant Andrea Josten signed record deals with various record companies. Runner-up Juliette Schoppmann also signed with BMG, but in contrast to public expectations she declined working with Bohlen. Instead, she released three singles of which two entered the top ten and a solo album, \"Unique\", which eventually debuted in 2004. Due to moderate sales BMG dropped her shortly after its release. She has since made herself a name as professional songwriter. Third-placed Daniel Küblböck also expanded his nationwide but extremely polarising popularity with a contract with BMG. Until June 2004 he released four major succeeded hit singles and a number-one album, titled \"Positive Energien\" (2003). However, further efforts failed on the charts after a controversial participations in the German versions of \"I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!\" and \"Big Brother\" and the release of his flopped motion picture \"Daniel – Der Zauberer\" (2004).\n\nVanessa Struhler became the protégé of Hip-Hop producer DJ Tomekk and saw solid commercial success with her first album, \"Ride with Me\" (2003). Gracia Baur also was signed to BMG, but was dropped after her moderate succeeded rock debut \"Intoxicated\" (2003). She then signed with Bros Music and was selected to represent Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 with the song \"Run & Hide\", where it placed last in a field of 24. Judith Lefeber, Daniel Lopes, and Nektarios Bamiatzis also scored mediocre to little success after the show with their own releases.\n\nIn the second series of \"DSDS\" 2003–2004, co-hosts Hunziker and Spengemann and all four jury members reprised their engagements in the show. Following the success of the first installment, the second season was aired to a higher profile during 2003 fall schedule, including an increased number of episodes, budgets and charges for commercial spots. In contrast to the first season, however, the second soon found its main audience but never reached the overwhelming hype and demand which the first season had captured. This fact was underscored by decreasing phone votes and ratings, which were released after the show's final.\n\nUnlike in season one, the other finalists hit on major problems when they watched out for record deals. While runner-up Denise Tillmanns never signed a recording contract, third-place finisher Philippe Bühler established himself as a professional songwriter and released two R&B-influenced singles, entitled \"Warum?\" (2005) and \"Ich Kann Dich Lieben\" (2006), both of which entered the top forty of the German Singles Chart. Anke Wagner signed with independent label Perleberg, but neither her debut single nor her album magaged to enter any chart. Benjamin Martell was signed to BMG, but was dropped when he demanded to write the album by himself. Fifth-place finisher Gunther Göbbel became part of the R&B duo Lemon Ice, whose cover single \"Stand by Me\" entered the German top twenty in fall 2006. Lorenzo Woodard participated in several prominent reality shows such as \"Die Alm\" and \"Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus!\" and has since enjoyed media attention under his transsexual identity \"Lorielle London\".\n\n After an absence of one year (2004–2005), the third season 2005–2006 introduced several new elements. Neither Hunziker nor Spengemann were asked back as the show's hosts as the studio wanted a new complexion on the season. They were replaced with Marco Schreyl and Dutch co-host Tooske Ragas. The jury cast also went through radical changes; Dieter Bohlen remained the only original member, and was eventually joined by music producer Sylvia Kollek and former manager Heinz Henn.\n\nDeutschland sucht den Superstar Season 4 is the fourth season of Deutschland sucht den Superstar which aired on RTL network. Mark Medlock, this season's winner, was awarded a contract with Sony-BMG. The judges in this season were Dieter Bohlen, Heinz Henn and Anja Lukaseder. It was hosted by Marco Schreyl and Tooske Ragas. The viewers chose the contestant's fates as they were able to call for their favorite contestant. The voting results were published on 7 May.\n\n Because of the success of season four RTL decided to create a fifth season in 2008. This was announced just before the fourth season final show was shown on TV. There were several changes: Marco Schreyl became the sole host of the show, without the assistance of Tooske Ragas. Due to some arguments with Dieter Bohlen, Heinz Henn was replaced in the jury by Andreas \"Bär\" Läsker. Läsker discovered and is the manager of Die Fantastischen Vier (The Fantastic Four), and joined existing jury members Bohlen and Anja Lukaseder. The last substantial change concerns only one semi-final shows (\"Top 15 shows\") with the name \"Jetzt oder nie\" (Now or Never): So far the 10 best candidates had been determined by telephone and SMS voting. Instead the jury selected the Top 10 live in front of 1,000 spectators. The five contestants with the highest number of votes from the public went through to the motto shows. The judges picked five more contestants of the remaining 10 to join them. Later, the candidates enter the final shows with public voting as in the earlier series. With the new rules, the producers hope to increase the excitement and to prevent good candidates from being knocked out too early.\nThe auditions started in August on Mallorca and for the first time ever on Ibiza. From September on the casting crew toured throughout Germany.\nThe first show, \"Now or never – Jetzt oder nie\", started on 8 March.\n\nDeutschland sucht den Superstar Season 6 was the sixth season of Deutschland sucht den Superstar which is airing on the RTL network. This season's winner, Daniel Schuhmacher, was awarded a contract with Sony-BMG. The judges in this season are Dieter Bohlen, Nina Eichinger, and Volker Neumüller. This season is hosted by Marco Schreyl. The viewers chose the contestant's fates as they were able to call for their favorite contestant.\nAs with season 5, the \"top 10\" was created by the top 5 contestants with the most telephone and SMS voting and the other 5 were selected by the jury. The sixth season started on 21 January 2009.\n\nDeutschland sucht den Superstar Season 7 is the seventh season of the Idol series which aired on RTL Television and started on 6 January 2010. The season marked a new national record with more than 35,000 participants. The final aired on 17 April 2010, and the winner was Mehrzad Marashi.\n\nMehrzad Marahsi won the show. Second was Menowin Fröhlich and on third place Manuel Hoffmann. Menowin has won every liveshow but lost against Mehrzad who won the final with 56,04%. Manuel Hoffmann was eliminated in the 5th show, but he came back after Helmut Orosz was expelled from the show. Manuel came back and reached the semi-final, so that he was the first one who was eliminated and has survived more than one show again. Thomas Karaoglan, who reached the 5th place was known as \"der Checker\" and Kim Debkowski has made some advertisement during her video previous her performance with some beauty tips on \"Kim Gloss Tv\".\n\nThe live-shows began with the Top-15 show to determine the contestants that would make up the Top 10 in the mottoshows. As done in the previous seasons, the Top 10 were contestants put through from the public vote and the jury's vote. However, 7 (instead of 5) contestants were put through with the public votes and 3 (instead of 5) would be put through by the jury; which ultimately became the contestants that ranked with the next three largest number of votes. In the first live show, Steffi Landerer, who was known for her sex appeal, was eliminated. Marcel Pluschke, who was eliminated on the second live-show, did not perceive an excellent audience respect because of his weak voice and country music roots (which was a first in DSDS). Though criticized for his song selection in the third live show, Nelson Sangaré was surprisingly eliminated after ranking as one of the top contestants throughout the first and second live-shows. After being in the bottom groups every week, Ines Redjeb was eventually eliminated in the fourth live-show. Though proving to be a favorite in the competition despite ranking in the bottom half of the voting, Manuel Hoffmann was eliminated in the fifth show against Helmut Orosz. Orosz, who was a Top 50 contestant in the second season, became criticized for his problems with singing correct texts; immediately after Hoffmann's elimination, the producers of DSDS had found a video of Orosz with a friend using cocaine recently, to which Orosz confessed. Because of this, Orosz was disqualified from the contest and Hoffmann returned to the live-shows surpassing crowd favorite Thomas Karaoglan in the sixth-live show and Kim Debkowski in the seventh live-show. However, Hoffmann's journey ended in the semi-final leaving the finale in the hands of the season's front-runners Menowin Fröhlich and Mehrzad Marashi. Fröhlich, a local DJ, successfully auditioned for the show in the third season making it to the Top-20 live-shows; he later became disqualified due to battery and fraud. Both friends throughout the recall, tensions rose throughout the competition between fans and themselves. After the final vote, Marashi won though only ranking in first place in the Top-15 and the finale as Fröhlich ranked first every week.\n\nDeutschland sucht den Superstar Season 8 is the eighth season of the Idol series in Germany began airing on RTL on 8 January 2011. The winner will get a recording contract with Universal Music Group. 34,956 people auditioned throughout the 35 cities that hosted auditions. Nina Eichinger and Volker Neumüller were removed from the panel. Their successors are Swiss singer Patrick Nuo and singer/dancer Fernanda Brandao. Marco Schreyl returned as the host. DSDS has extended participation privileges to Austria and Switzerland. The Top 35 will be going to the Maldives. The final aired on 7 May 2011, and the winner was Pietro Lombardi. This season reintroduced the contestants singing with backing tracks as opposed to a live band.\n\nThe \"Hamburger Morgenpost\" questioned whether RTL misquoted DSDS Top 10 candidate Anna-Carina Woitschack. In an interview, Anna-Carina was quoted as saying \"It was cut together all wrong. I never said that I hate Sarah – but on the contrary, I do not hate Sarah Engels. That is what I said. But it was cut this way by RTL, because it looks good for the show.\"\n\nRTL received a statement from the Office of Public Safety stating that Sebastian Wurth was not allowed to participate after 10 PM. RTL was also fined 15,000 Euro for the incident.\n\nThe \"Hamburger Morgenpost\" questioned whether the liveshows were actually live broadcast. In the 3rd Mottoshow, Marco Angelini slipped up in his performance and forgot to sing at the correct time.\n\nPietro Lombardi's brother posted nude picture of Sarah Engels after she used Pietro's cell phone to talk to girls. The hardcore fans of Pietro Lombardi told his brother Marco about this and he wasn't happy about this. So, he decided to take \"revenge.\" Pietro's brother also wrote \"Everyone knows how cheap Sarah Engels is. She is sneaky. A liar.\"\n\nDSDS host Marco Schreyl mixed up the phone numbers for candidates Zazou Mall and Marco Angelini. A camera shot of Marco Angelini showed him enraged towards the lens. A reporter for the Hamburger Morgenpost, who was present, reported there were chaotic scenes shortly before the end of the recording. Dieter Bohlen mentioned the mistake and Marco Schreyl replied that \"It could be made easier for the host\". RTL decided that no candidate would be eliminated and the final show was pushed back a week.\n\nOn the 6th mottoshow, Sarah Engels had two wardrobe incidents, when dancing to \"Walking on Sunshine\", where she began dancing too close to one of the cameras, causing two upskirts. This was eventually shown to the studio audience during the recap of her performance and was noted by the judges.\n\nDeutschland sucht den Superstar (season 9) is the ninth season of \"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\". Jury members Fernanda Brandao and Patrick Nuo left DSDS and were replaced by Bruce Darnell and Cascada's Natalie Horler. The winner will receive a recording contract with Universal Music Group and €500,000. Participants must be between the ages of 16 and 30 and living in Germany, Austria or Switzerland. The auditions stage had 34 audition events in 33 cities across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 35.401 participants auditioned for season 9. RTL decided to have a \"Top 16\" instead of a \"Top 15\". Unlike previous seasons, participants sung in a duet. Luca Hänni won season 9. At age 17, Luca is the youngest winner-to-date.\n\nThe Cologne district government wants to enforce a law that protect minors. The law will not allow minors to participate on stage after 10 PM. The issue started last season when this law was enforced for Sebastian Wurth. RTL received a 15,000 Euro fine for the incident. The candidates that this would affect are Daniele Negroni, age 16; Luca Hänni, age 17; Vanessa Krasniqi, age 17 and Fabienne Rothe, age 16. RTL decided to cancel the results show for 7, 14 and 21 April due to the minor protection law.\n\nHamburger Morgenpost hinted that Thomas Pegram's elimination was expected because of some of his statistics on Facebook. He has the fewest people who clicked the \"like\" button only 4.105 people and received only 813 comments after the official DSDS Facebook fanpage put up his photo. Hamburger Morgenpost continued this when Silvia Amaru was eliminated restating how the lowest \"like\" total showed who was going to be eliminated before the final decision. Silvia Amaru's photo had 4.761 \"like\" while the competition was at around 10.000 on Sunday 11 March at 10:15 CET. Hamburger Morgenpost stated that it should be \"clear\" for RTL that \"Facebook is a power killer\" for \"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\". In the Top 8, Kristof had the fews likes for his photo and was not voted out of the show.\n\nKristof Hering suffered verbal and death threats during his participation during season 9 due to his homosexuality. People were writing stuff like \"You are sooo gay to ..\"; \"I'll cut your eggs\"; \"Get out of DSDS, if you value your life\" and \"I stab you up\". RTL filed charges against unknown persons because of the threats.\n\nTV ratings for season 9 have been disappointing. None of the mottoshows have reached 5 million viewers. season 1 averaged 8.09 million viewers and season 8 averaged 6.32 million viewers in the show's key demographic (ages 14 to 49). Only 4.71 million people watch the final show of season 9. This is the lowest viewership in the history of all the final shows of DSDS. RTL stated they want to continue with the show declining rates.\n\nOn 30 April 2012, RTL announced that the show will return for a tenth season, in spite of declining ratings in Season 9. It was also announced that previous judges Natalie Horler and Bruce Darnell as well as host Marco Schreyl will be replaced. Furthermore, a \"female quota\" will be introduced in order to have an equal balance of male and female contestants.\n\nAccording to reports, the show was supposed to have a live band accompanying the contestants in the live shows, which has been absent since season 8. However, the first motto show of the season did not feature a live band and contestants sounded to be singing to pre-recorded tracks.\n\nOn 14 September 2012, RTL announced Tom and Bill Kaulitz from the MTV Video Music Awards winning band Tokio Hotel and Mateo Jaschik founding member of the German dancehall band Culcha Candela as the replacements for Natalie Horler and Bruce Darnell in the jury. This is the first time since season 2 that the jury consisted of four judges.\n\nThe first episode attracted 5.18 Mio. viewers, which marks the lowest season premiere rating since Season 1, which has not been broadcast on the primetime slot on 8.15pm. Despite this, the show was renewed for an eleventh season for 2014. Only 4,63 Mio. viewers watched the final, a major low record.\n\nThe winner of the tenth season was Beatrice Egli. She became the first female winner since season 2 and the first German Schlager singer to win the competition. The season featured a female finale which has happened only twice so far in the history of the show. Furthermore, this is the first time that three women reached the final four.\n\nOn 13 March 2013 RTL announced, that there will be an eleventh season. The judges from the previous season, with the exception of Dieter Bohlen, were replaced by rapper Prince Kay One, the singer \"Mieze Katz\" of the band MIA., and the Schlager singer Marianne Rosenberg. Nazan Eckes returned as the host of the eleventh season, however without Raúl Richter. The season started on Wednesday, 8 January 2014 on RTL.\n\nThe top 30, which consisted of 15 female and 15 male contestants, were brought to Cuba for the further competition. In the top 20 round, the judges chose the top ten to compete in the live shows. Five of the ten eliminated contestants were given a wild card by the judges and made available for public voting. The two with the highest votes by the viewers will be joining the top 10.\n\nThe season premiere attracted 2,70 Mil. viewers, which makes it the least-watched season premiere in the history of \"Deutschland such den Superstar\". However, ratings improved up to 3,33 Mil. viewers by episode three, which makes it the most watched episode of the season so far within the demographics between ages 14–49. Overall, this season showed the lowest ratings in the history of the show.\n\nFor the second year in a row this season featured a female final top two and producing a female Superstar for the third time in the history of the show. Aneta Sablik was announced as the winner on 3 May 2014.\n\nDuring the live-shows of season 11, it was announced that the castings for season 12 will start in August 2014. RTL's Head of Programm Frank Hoffmann stated in April 2014 that he wants to keep the series for the years the come, although the ratings continued to fall, especially in the live shows.

The station is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, as part of a duopoly with Garland-licensed Univision owned-and-operated station KUVN-DT (channel 23). The two stations share studios on Bryan Street (near I-345/US 75) in downtown Dallas; KSTR's transmitter is located south of Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on April 17, 1984 as KLTJ-TV (the call letters stood for \"Keep Looking To Jesus\"). Founded by Eldred Thomas, owner of radio station KVTT-FM (91.7, now KKXT), it originally maintained a religious programming format as an affiliate of the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). In early 1986, Thomas sold the station to Silver King Broadcasting, the broadcasting arm of the Home Shopping Network (HSN). As a result of the sale, the station became an affiliate of HSN in September of that year; this left TBN without an outlet in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex for the next five months, until it launched owned-and-operated station KDTX-TV (channel 58) in February 1987. On June 1, 1987, the station changed its call letters to KHSX (standing for \"Home Shopping in Texas\").\n\nOn November 27, 1995, veteran television executive Barry Diller announced that he would acquire the Home Shopping Network and Silver King Communications, which owned HSN-affiliated stations in several other larger media markets. The purchase was finalized on December 19, 1996, ten months after the transaction received approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 11. Two years later in 1997, HSN purchased the USA Network, and renamed its broadcast television subsidiary as USA Broadcasting, as part of a corporate rebranding borrowing from the identity of its new cable channel property. That year, KHSX began carrying a one-hour block of programming from business news channel Bloomberg Information Television (now simply Bloomberg Television) at 6:00 a.m. daily and added a block of classic children's programs on Sunday mornings.\n\nIn June 1998, USA Broadcasting launched a customized independent station format, \"CityVision\", which infused syndicated programming—including a few produced by sister production unit Studios USA that also aired nationally on USA Network—with a limited amount of local entertainment and magazine programs (reminiscent of the format used by CITY-TV in Toronto and more prominently, that station's sister broadcast television properties that became charter stations of Citytv, when CHUM Limited expanded the format to other Canadian markets as a television system in 2002).\nOn October 15, 1999, the station changed its call letters to KSTR-TV (which were used as part of the station's branding, phonetically pronounced as \"K-Star\"). Channel 49 adopted the \"CityVision\" format first adopted the previous fall by Miami sister station WAMI-TV on that date, converting into a general entertainment independent station; HSN programming remained part of the schedule, however it was relegated to two separate blocks, running nightly from 2:00 to 5:30 a.m.\n\nKSTR's initial lineup under the \"CityVision\" format began to primarily feature a mix of reality shows (such as \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" and \"Real TV\"), sitcoms (such as \"Sister, Sister\", \"The Three Stooges\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"NewsRadio\") and talk shows during the daytime and prime time hours, as well as drama series (\"Knight Rider\" and \"The A-Team\") on weekend evenings, and movies—under the \"Star Time Movies\" banner—during prime time on weekends and on Sunday late afternoons. It also aired USA's original programs (such as \"Tens\"—rebroadcast from its Miami sister station WAMI-TV—and \"Strip Poker\"), along with the regionally syndicated newscast \"The News of Texas\". It also carried a decent lineup of children's programming on Saturday mornings, including those sourced from the BKN syndication block (such as \"\", \"Mighty Max\", \"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\", \"Sonic Underground\", \"Jumanji\", \"Pocket Dragon Adventures\", \"Beakman's World\" and \"Extreme Dinosaurs\").\nDuring this period, KSTR served as the official station for the Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise. The station also used the \"City Vision\" (\"Your City is Our Studio\") bumper cards common with USA-owned stations that had converted to general entertainment independents during this time. The local programming-infused format that was adopted by KSTR-DT and its sister stations in Atlanta and Miami, was originally planned to be expanded to the remainder of USA Broadcasting's stations, with some (such as WHOT-TV (now WUVG-DT) in Atlanta and WHUB-TV (now WUTF-DT) in Boston) having either already adopted or eventually switching to the format.\n\nDue to financial problems, in September 2000, USA eliminated half of KSTR's entertainment programming inventory, filling the newly opened time periods with an expanded block of infomercials during the morning hours and an additional block of HSN programming on weekday mornings from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (later reduced to a three-hour block from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. by September 2001). The station also reduced its children's programs inventory to a daily half-hour of educational programming (consisting of the reality-documentary series \"Animal Rescue\").\n\nIn the summer of 2000, USA Networks announced that it would sell off its television station group, in order to focus on its cable network and television production properties. Among the prospective buyers for the USA Broadcasting unit was The Walt Disney Company—the corporate parent of ABC, the network affiliated locally with WFAA (channel 8)—which was the original frontrunner to purchase the thirteen-station group. However, Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications beat out Disney and the competing bidders in a close race, securing a deal to purchase the USA Broadcasting stations for $1.1 billion on December 7, 2000. When the sale was finalized on May 21, 2001, KSTR became part of a duopoly with Univision owned-and-operated station KUVN (channel 23).\n\nThe week prior to the sale's completion, on May 15, 2001, Univision Communications announced during its upfront presentation that it would launch a secondary television network—later announced to be named TeleFutura (now UniMás) on July 31—that would compete with Univision, Telemundo and the then-recently launched Azteca América. Univision would utilize the former USA Broadcasting stations to serve as charter outlets of the network, which would cater to bilingual Latinos and young adult males between the ages 18 and 34 that seldom watch Spanish language television other than sporting events.\nUnivision, however, continued to maintain English language programming formats on the nine HSN affiliates and four independent stations it acquired from USA Networks for fourteen months following the completion of the purchase. Despite this, the station utilized its ties to Univision on September 11, 2001, when KSTR simulcast live coverage of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia as well as the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania from KUVN for several days afterward, before resuming what was left of its regular English language schedule on September 18. On September 2, 2001, Channel 49 began incorporating daily, two-hour-long mini-marathons of \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and movies to fill part of its schedule for its final months as an English language station. \n\nKSTR officially converted into a Spanish language station on January 14, 2002, when it became an owned-and-operated station of TeleFutura, which initially launched on that date on 18 Univision-owned stations (including eleven of KSTR's large-market sister stations under USA Broadcasting ownership). The meager programming inventory that had occupied KSTR's schedule prior to the switch was subsequently acquired by KFWD (channel 52, now a Sonlife Broadcasting Network affiliate), which itself converted into an English language independent station days earlier on January 1, after losing its Telemundo affiliation to KXTX-TV (channel 39) as a result of NBC/Telemundo's acquisition of that station; the local over-the-air television rights to the Mavericks were concurrently transferred to then-UPN affiliate KTXA (channel 21, now an independent station).\n\nIn January 2018, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Nexstar Media Group, and Univision Communications announced that they reached an agreement with American Tower Corporation to construct an ATSC 3.0 single-frequency network in Dallas. It was decided that Univision-owned KSTR-DT would become the test station, with Univision owned-and-operated sister station KUVN-DT, and Sinclair-operated station KTXD-TV, providing ATSC 1.0 simulcasts of KSTR-DT's programming during the tests.\n\nIn November 2018, KSTR-DT submitted an experimental special temporary authority (STA) to the FCC, to test ATSC 3.0 distributed transmission system (DTS) broadcasting. The FCC granted the STA in February 2019, with testing beginning in March 2019. KSTR-DT's ATSC 3.0 DTS test consisted of four transmitters located throughout the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, all broadcasting on UHF channel 48: Cedar Hill (main transmitter), Garland, Fort Worth, and Denton.\n\nIn July 2019, KSTR-DT shut down its channel 48 transmitters as part of the broadcast frequency repacking process following the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction, and began broadcasting from an auxiliary transmitter on its assigned displacement channel 34. DTS testing resumed after all transmitters were broadcasting on channel 34.\n\nDue to ATSC 3.0-capable tuners not being widely available, KSTR-DT began simulcasting its programming on KUVN-DT (49.1 UniMás & 49.3 Grit) and KTXD-TV (49.2 GetTV) in February 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKSTR-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 49, on January 12, 2009. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 48, using PSIP to display its virtual channel as 49 on digital television receivers.\n\n"}

The club's traditional home ground is Bloomfield Stadium. To date, the club has won thirteen championships and sixteen State Cups. In 1967 Hapoel Tel Aviv became the first club to win the Asian Club Championships.\n\nSince 1995 the club has competed in European club competitions, and has the highest rank among all Israeli clubs, with some outstanding achievements, such as wins against Chelsea, Milan, Hamburg, Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Rangers, and Celtic. It is also one of only 3 Israeli teams to have qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage, and one of the two which are ordinary members of the European Club Association.\n\nThe club name, \"Hapoel\", translates to \"The Worker\", and combined with its red Hammer and sickle badge represents the club ties to Marxism, Socialism, and the working class. For seven decades, the club was owned by the Histadrut, Israel's national trade union center.\n\nHapoel Tel Aviv F.C. was originally established in 1923, but was disbanded soon after. The club was re-formed in 1925, and then for a third time in May 1926. In 1927 the club merged with Allenby F.C., giving the club its modern form. It is part of the Hapoel sports association which was affiliated with the Histadrut, and supporters of the club were often referred to as communists.\n\nIn 1928 the club reached the Palestine Cup final (the first one to be recognised by the Israel Football Association). Although they beat Maccabi Hasmonean Jerusalem 2–0, Hapoel fielded an ineligible player, resulting in the cup being shared.\n\nThe 1933–34 saw the club win the double, finishing as champions of the Palestine League, winning every match, the only Israeli club to have achieved such a feat, and winners of the cup, beating local rivals Maccabi Tel Aviv 3–2 in the final. The 1934–35 season saw Hapoel led the league table, but the championship was abandoned and they were not declared champions. The 1937–38 season ended the same way, with Hapoel top of the league, but the season abandoned. In the meantime, the club won the cup again in 1937, 1938 and 1939, and remain the only club to have won the trophy in three successive seasons (although the Royal Air Force won it four years in a row between 1924 and 1927, pre-1928 wins are not recognised by the IFA).\n\nIn 1939–40 they won their second championship. The following season no national championships were held, but the club won the tournament for Hapoel-affiliated clubs. They won a third championship in the 1943–44 season, and in the following year won the northern region league, as well as what became known as the \"War Cup\", which was boycotted by\nBeitar-affiliated clubs. In the cup final Hapoel were leading Hapoel Petah Tikva 1–0, but the match was abandoned on 89 minutes when a Petah Tikva player refused to leave the pitch after being sent off for insulting the referee.\n\nFollowing Israeli independence, Hapoel joined the new Israeli League. They won the title in 1956–57 and the State Cup in 1961, beating Hapoel Petah Tikva 2–1.\n\nIn the 1965–66 season Hapoel won the title, and qualified for the first Asian Club Championships. In the tournament Hapoel were given byes all the way to the final, where they beat Selangor 2–1 to become Asia's first club champions. The club also reached the State Cup final that year, but lost 2–1 to Maccabi Tel Aviv.\n\nHapoel won the title again in 1968–69, and again qualified for the Asian Club championships. Although they reached the final, they lost 2–1 to Iranian side Taj Club (in an era when Iran and Israel had diplomatic relations). They won the State Cup again in 1972, beating Hapoel Jerusalem 1–0 in the final, but did not win the title again until 1980–81, when they missed out on the double after losing the cup final 4–3 on penalties (after a 2–2 draw) to Bnei Yehuda. The following season they reached the cup final again, but lost 1–0 to Hapoel Yehud. A hat-trick of cup final defeats was avoided when they beat Maccabi Tel Aviv 3–2 in the 1982 final.\n\nAnother title was won in 1985–86, and another in 1987–88. However, the following season Hapoel finished bottom of the league (with a four-point deduction for breaking budget rules) and were relegated to the second tier for the first time in their history.\n\nThe club made an immediate return to the top division as Liga Artzit runners-up, though they only beat Maccabi Yavne to the second promotion slot on goal difference. In 1997–98 Hapoel finished second, and qualified for Europe for the second time. In the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Hapoel knocked out FinnPa, before losing on penalties to Strømsgodset. In the same season they won the State Cup, beating Beitar Jerusalem 3–1 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.\n\nThe 1999–2000 season saw Hapoel win the double, claiming their first title in over a decade and winning the State Cup (beating Beitar Jerusalem on penalties again). However, they failed to reach the group stages of the Champions League after being beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Sturm Graz. They finished second in the league in 2000–01 and 2001–02 and third in 2002–03, qualifying for the UEFA Cup on each occasion. In the 2001–02 UEFA Cup Hapoel reached the quarter-finals after knocking out Chelsea, Lokomotiv Moscow and Parma. Although they beat A.C. Milan 1–0 in the home leg (a match which had to be played in the GSP Stadium in Cyprus as UEFA did not allow matches to be held in Israel due to security reasons), Hapoel lost the away leg 2–0.\n\nIn 2002 the club won its first Toto Cup. They won the State Cup in 2006, beating Bnei Yehuda 1–0 in the final, and also won it the following season, when they defeated second division Hapoel Ashkelon on penalties. They reached the final again in 2007–08, but lost 5–4 on penalties to Beitar Jerusalem after a 0–0 draw.\n\nIn 2009–10, the club won the double, claiming the State Cup after a 3–1 victory over Bnei Yehuda. The title was won after a dramatic game against Beitar Jerusalem on the final day of the season, with Eran Zahavi scoring the title-winning goal two minutes into injury time. The club also had a successful season in the Europa League, winning their group, before losing to Rubin Kazan in the second round. The following season they reached the group stages of the Champions League for the first time, but failed to advance to the next round. at the same season the team reached to the second place and won the Israeli State Cup for the second time in row.\n\nIn the beginning of season 2011–12 most of the successful players of the team left and spread at Europe, also the Team's manager Eli Guttman left too. The club's legendary coach, Dror Kashtan, returned and new players came as part of the transfer of ownership of the club to Eli Tabib. During the season there was tension between the manager Dror Kashtan and Eli Tabib, which led to the manager's departure and current Manager was appointed in his place, Nitzan Shirazi, who led the team winning the Israeli State Cup for the third time in a row. After large-scale protests of the fans against the club's owner Tabib and his unprofessional conduct, he decided to leave the club after one year and sold it to Haim Ramon and to the supporters' trust called \"Haadumim\", \"The Reds\" in Hebrew, that establish at the summer of 2012 and raise 2 million shekel for 20% of the ownership. The other part of the club sold to several other businessmen. Altogether the club sold at summer 2012 for 12 million NIS (about $ 3 Million).\nAt the beginning of season 2012–13, Yossi Abuksis was appointed coach in place of Nitzan Shirazi, who appointed professional manager due to his health reasons. On 1 July 2015, the club was bought by Amir Gross Kabiri.\n\nAfter playing at three different stadiums, the club moved to the old Bloomfield Stadium in 1949, after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In 1962 the ground was renovated using donation from the Bloomfield family, thus receiving its official name. The ground was owned by Tel-Aviv histadrut branch, who were also owners of Hapoel, although today it is a municipal stadium.\n\nThe stadium, located in Jaffa, is an upgraded version of the older stadium called \"Basa\". The first match at the new Bloomfield was played on 12 December 1962 against FC Twente, the game ending in a 1–1 draw. The stadium is currently shared with city rivals Maccabi (who moved to the ground in 2000) and Bnei Yehuda (since 2004).\n\nHapoel main fans' gate is gate 5, where Ultras Hapoel lead the cheering, and away crowds sit oppositely, on Gate 11. Another traditional Hapoel fans' gate is gate 7.\n\nBloomfield Stadium has been under renovation for expansion since 2016, and the team temporarily plays at HaMoshava Stadium in Petah Tikva.\n\nThe team is the standard-bearer of the Israeli left and far-left. It was the last club to cut formal links with politics, in this case the trade union movement and the moderate Social Democratic Labor Party Mapai, as well more radical parties such as the Marxist Party Mapam, and its predecessor Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party and the Marxist-Leninist Israeli Communist Party (Maki).\n\nUltras Hapoel often wave flags emblazoned with the faces of Che Guevara and Karl Marx, as well as banners with the slogan \"Workers of the world, unite!\". The club ultras has friendships with many other antifa supporter groups, including strong bonds with fans of FC St. Pauli, Standard Liège, Omonia Nicosia and Celtic F.C..\n\nHapoel's two rivals are Maccabi Tel Aviv, whose game against them is the Tel Aviv derby and, above all, Beitar Jerusalem, which is considered (and considers itself) the team of the Israeli far-right.\n\nA \"Haaretz\" poll published on June 2011 identified Hapoel Tel Aviv as the second most popular football team among Israeli Arabs, behind Maccabi Haifa.\n\nAnother survey had been conducted in March 2012 by Yedioth showed that Hapoel is the fourth most popular team among Israeli football fans (nineteen percent). The same survey revealed that thirty-two percent of Tel Aviv residents support the team.\n\n\"As of 30 January 2020\n\n \n\nOnly up to six non-Israeli nationals can be in an Israeli club, but only five can play at the same time on the pitch. Those with Jewish ancestry, married to an Israeli, or have played in Israel for an extended period of time, can claim a passport or permanent residency which would allow them to play with Israeli status.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both Global Mirror for ESS (Asynchronous PPRC) and XRC (Global Mirror for z/Series) are asynchronous replication technologies, although their implementations are somewhat different.\n\nExtended Remote Copy or XRC is now known as Global Mirror for z/Series (XRC).\n\nXRC is a z/Series asynchronous disk mirroring technique which is effective over any distance. It keeps the data time consistent across multiple ESS (Enterprise Storage Server) or HDS (Hitachi Data Systems) disk subsystems at the recovery site. \n\nXRC functions as a combination of disk (IBM ESS or HDS licensed) Microcode and application code running on a z/Series host and provides a recovery point that is time consistent across multiple disk subsystems.\n\nThe host component of the software is called the System Data Mover or SDM. The SDM ensures that no dependent writes are made out of sequence and data residing on the secondary volumes will always provide a time consistent copy of the primary volumes being mirrored.\n\n"}

The GW invariants may be packaged as a homology or cohomology class in an appropriate space, or as the deformed cup product of quantum cohomology. These invariants have been used to distinguish symplectic manifolds that were previously indistinguishable. They also play a crucial role in closed type IIA string theory. They are named after Mikhail Gromov and Edward Witten.\n\nThe rigorous mathematical definition of Gromov–Witten invariants is lengthy and difficult, so it is treated separately in the stable map article. This article attempts a more intuitive explanation of what the invariants mean, how they are computed, and why they are important.\n\nConsider the following:\nNow we define the Gromov–Witten invariants associated to the 4-tuple: (\"X\", \"A\", \"g\", \"n\"). Let formula_1 be the Deligne–Mumford moduli space of curves of genus \"g\" with \"n\" marked points and formula_2 denote the moduli space of stable maps into \"X\" of class \"A\", for some chosen almost complex structure \"J\" on \"X\" compatible with its symplectic form. The elements of formula_2 are of the form: \nwhere \"C\" is a (not necessarily stable) curve with \"n\" marked points \"x\", ..., \"x\" and \"f\" : \"C\" → \"X\" is pseudoholomorphic. The moduli space has real dimension\n\nLet\ndenote the stabilization of the curve. Let\nwhich has real dimension formula_8. There is an evaluation map\nThe evaluation map sends the fundamental class of formula_2 to a \"d\"-dimensional rational homology class in \"Y\", denoted\nIn a sense, this homology class is the Gromov–Witten invariant of \"X\" for the data \"g\", \"n\", and \"A\". It is an invariant of the symplectic isotopy class of the symplectic manifold \"X\".\n\nTo interpret the Gromov–Witten invariant geometrically, let β be a homology class in formula_1 and formula_13 homology classes in \"X\", such that the sum of the codimensions of formula_14 equals \"d\". These induce homology classes in \"Y\" by the Künneth formula. Let\nwhere formula_16 denotes the intersection product in the rational homology of \"Y\". This is a rational number, the Gromov–Witten invariant for the given classes. This number gives a \"virtual\" count of the number of pseudoholomorphic curves (in the class \"A\", of genus \"g\", with domain in the β-part of the Deligne–Mumford space) whose \"n\" marked points are mapped to cycles representing the formula_17.\n\nPut simply, a GW invariant counts how many curves there are that intersect \"n\" chosen submanifolds of \"X\". However, due to the \"virtual\" nature of the count, it need not be a natural number, as one might expect a count to be. For the space of stable maps is an orbifold, whose points of isotropy can contribute noninteger values to the invariant.\n\nThere are numerous variations on this construction, in which cohomology is used instead of homology, integration replaces intersection, Chern classes pulled back from the Deligne–Mumford space are also integrated, etc.\n\nGromov–Witten invariants are generally difficult to compute. While they are defined for any generic almost complex structure \"J\", for which the linearization \"D\" of the formula_18operator is surjective, they must actually be computed with respect to a specific, chosen \"J\". It is most convenient to choose \"J\" with special properties, such as nongeneric symmetries or integrability. Indeed, computations are often carried out on Kähler manifolds using the techniques of algebraic geometry.\n\nHowever, a special \"J\" may induce a nonsurjective \"D\" and thus a moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves that is larger than expected. Loosely speaking, one corrects for this effect by forming from the cokernel of \"D\" a vector bundle, called the obstruction bundle, and then realizing the GW invariant as the integral of the Euler class of the obstruction bundle. Making this idea precise requires significant technical argument using Kuranishi structures.\n\nThe main computational technique is localization. This applies when \"X\" is toric, meaning that it is acted upon by a complex torus, or at least locally toric. Then one can use the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem, of Michael Atiyah and Raoul Bott, to reduce, or localize, the computation of a GW invariant to an integration over the fixed-point locus of the action.\n\nAnother approach is to employ symplectic surgeries to relate \"X\" to one or more other spaces whose GW invariants are more easily computed. Of course, one must first understand how the invariants behave under the surgeries. For such applications one often uses the more elaborate relative GW invariants, which count curves with prescribed tangency conditions along a symplectic submanifold of \"X\" of real codimension two.\n\nThe GW invariants are closely related to a number of other concepts in geometry, including the Donaldson invariants and Seiberg–Witten invariants in the symplectic category, and Donaldson–Thomas theory in the algebraic category. For compact symplectic four-manifolds, Clifford Taubes showed that a variant of the GW invariants (see Taubes's Gromov invariant) are equivalent to the Seiberg–Witten invariants. They are conjectured to contain the same information as Donaldson–Thomas invariants and Gopakumar–Vafa invariants, both of which are integer-valued.\n\nGW invariants can also be defined using the language of algebraic geometry. In some cases, GW invariants agree with classical enumerative invariants of algebraic geometry. However, in general GW invariants enjoy one important advantage over the enumerative invariants, namely the existence of a composition law which describes how curves glue. The GW invariants can be bundled up into the quantum cohomology ring of the manifold \"X\", which is a deformation of the ordinary cohomology. The composition law of GW invariants is what makes the deformed cup product associative.\n\nThe quantum cohomology ring is known to be isomorphic to the symplectic Floer homology with its pair-of-pants product.\n\nGW invariants are of interest in string theory, a branch of physics that attempts to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. In this theory, everything in the universe, beginning with the elementary particles, is made of tiny strings. As a string travels through spacetime it traces out a surface, called the worldsheet of the string. Unfortunately, the moduli space of such parametrized surfaces, at least \"a priori\", is infinite-dimensional; no appropriate measure on this space is known, and thus the path integrals of the theory lack a rigorous definition.\n\nThe situation improves in the variation known as closed A-model. Here there are six spacetime dimensions, which constitute a symplectic manifold, and it turns out that the worldsheets are necessarily parametrized by pseudoholomorphic curves, whose moduli spaces are only finite-dimensional. GW invariants, as integrals over these moduli spaces, are then path integrals of the theory. In particular, the free energy of the A-model at genus \"g\" is the generating function of the genus \"g\" GW invariants.\n\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 27, 1997. It was written by Donick Cary and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode guest stars Sab Shimono as Mr. Sparkle, Gedde Watanabe as the factory worker, Denice Kumagai and Karen Maruyama as dancers, and Frank Welker as the baboons. In the episode, Marge replaces Reverend Lovejoy as the town's moral adviser while Homer explores the mystery of why his face appears on a Japanese-language detergent box.\n\nAfter Reverend Lovejoy's sermon bores his congregation, Marge voices her concern over his lack of enthusiasm about helping people. Lovejoy explains that his passion faded as he dealt with Ned Flanders' constant trivial problems. Marge begins working for the Church as the \"Listen Lady\", listening to people's problems and helping solve them. Lovejoy realizes his inadequacy and feels depressed; visions of the saints chastise him for doing little to inspire his congregation.\n\nHomer takes Bart and Lisa to the Springfield dump to dispose of their Christmas tree, where they find a box of Japanese dishwasher detergent, Mr. Sparkle, whose mascot clearly resembles Homer. Disturbed, Homer contacts the manufacturer in Hokkaidō, Japan. Homer is sent a promotional video that reveals that the mascot is a result of a joint venture between two conglomerates, whose mascots, a fish and a lightbulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle; the similarity to Homer is a mere coincidence.\n\nNed calls Marge for help: the delinquents Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney, are loitering outside his store, the Leftorium. At her suggestion, he tries to shoo them away, but they harass him. Ned calls Marge again, but when the bullies cut the phone cord, Marge assumes that Ned has hung up and that everything is fine. The next morning, Maude informs Marge that Ned is missing. Marge goes to Lovejoy for help, and they track Ned to the zoo, where Japanese tourists think Homer is Mr. Sparkle. Lovejoy rescues Ned from the baboon enclosure and rediscovers his passion for his career, regaling his congregation with the tale of Ned's rescue.\n\nBy season 8, the show had begun to explore episodes revolving around secondary characters. Reverend Lovejoy was selected for this episode because, aside from being noted as \"the priest who didn't care\", he had not had much character development. This was the first episode that Donick Cary wrote for \"The Simpsons\". He was disappointed that his first story was about \"Marge's crisis with faith.\" The trip to the dump was inspired by Donick Cary's youth, in which he would often go \"dump picking\". This led to the writers deciding to have Homer's face on a discarded box, which became the Mr. Sparkle subplot. To help create the advertisement, the writers watched videos of many Japanese commercials. An original scene from Lovejoy's flashback showed that Jasper Beardley preceded him as minister of the First Church of Springfield. The solution for how Mr. Sparkle resembles Homer was written by George Meyer, after hours of time had been spent trying to come up with a realistic ending. Matsumura Fishworks was named after Ichiro Matsumura, a friend of David X. Cohen.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"In Marge We Trust\" finished 25th in ratings for the week of April 21–27, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 10.1, equivalent to approximately 9.8 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\" and \"King of the Hill\".\n\nThe episode received critical acclaim. \n\nAuthors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: \"A rare case of both storylines being worthy of full episodes in their own right, this is a cracking episode which highlights the unduly neglected Rev. Lovejoy and makes you realize Homer isn't the only one ready to kill Ned Flanders! Great stuff.\" \n\nIn a 2000 \"Entertainment Weekly\" article, Matt Groening ranked it as his fifth favorite in the history of the show. \n\nJosh Weinstein described it as one of the best of the season, as well as being one of the most underrated episodes of all time. He also described the Mr. Sparkle commercial as his all-time favorite sequence. \n\nThe fake Fruity Oaty Bar commercial from the film \"Serenity\" was partially inspired by the Mr. Sparkle advertisement. \n\nSince 2009, the show's new opening sequence includes Mr. Sparkle detergent with Marge's supermarket purchases.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301314", "title": "Double bridle", "text": "Double bridle\n\nA double bridle, also called a full bridle or Weymouth bridle, is a bridle that has two bits and four reins (sometimes called \"double reins\"). One bit is the \"bradoon\" (or \"bridoon\"), is a modified snaffle bit that is smaller in diameter and has smaller bit rings than a traditional snaffle, and it is adjusted so that it sits above and behind the other bit, a curb bit. Another term for this combination of curb and snaffle bit is a \"bit and bradoon\", where the word \"bit\" in this particular context refers to the curb.\n\nDouble bridles are most commonly associated with dressage and certain horse show classes where formal tack, attire and turnout is standard. They are required for upper level FEI dressage tests (Prix St. Georges (PSG), Intermediare, and Grand Prix), and are optional at the USDF third and fourth level. They are also permitted in the dressage phase of eventing at the Intermediate or Advanced levels, although not required. (In eventing, even at the advanced level, snaffle bridles are still the norm.)\n\nDouble bridles are fairly common for horse show purposes in Australia, and in the United Kingdom for show hunters and show hacks, but are less common at shows in the United States, except for Saddle seat, show hack and upper level Dressage competition. Additionally, ladies riding side saddle traditionally use a double bridle. Double bridles used to be seen on show hunters in the United States, but have been replaced by the snaffle.\n\nDouble bridles are rarely used by show jumping riders and eventers in the stadium and cross-country phases. The double bridle is still sometimes used by cavalry and police horses.\n\nWhile the snaffle bridle is more common, the double bridle, in the hands of an experienced rider, is able to transmit more nuanced commands and obtain more sophisticated responses from the horse. Thus, for advanced forms of riding, it is preferred.\n\nDouble bridles, originally called \"full bridles\", were much more common several hundred years ago. They were considered the \"proper\" equipment for a trained rider and horse, while a simple snaffle bridle was only for green horses and riders, young children, grooms, and poor riders. The double bridle is commonly seen in old paintings of hunt scenes, used by the well-trained gentry as they rode cross-country.\n\nAlthough the modern ideal is for balance between the snaffle and the curb, and most riders today tend to employ the bradoon for the majority of commands, historically, the accomplished rider would \"ride on the curb.\" Riding on the curb indicated lightness in the mouth, was a demonstration that both horse and rider had been highly trained, and that the rider had very good control of his or her hands, and was able to ride the horse mainly from the seat. The rider would keep a modest contact with the curb bit to regulate collection and only engage the bradoon bit to raise the head or reinforce leg and seat aids for impulsion and direction if those aids failed to achieve their effect. With a supremely trained horse and rider, not only would the horse be ridden on the curb only, but with placing both sets reins in one hand and carrying the whip upright in the other. Today, the tradition of riding only on the curb is preserved by classical and advanced military riders, and it is possible to see such performances at the Spanish Riding School. It is also used on finished horses in western riding. The tradition of riding with double reins in one hand is preserved by polo players, where double reins remain the norm but the double bridle has been largely replaced by the pelham bit or the gag bit.\n\nThe double bridle was once used frequently by fox hunters, as they could employ the bradoon at the beginning of the hunt, and then use the curb if the horse became excessively excited and forward as the hunt continued. Additionally, it allowed women, confined to riding sidesaddle at the time, to ride hotter horses, with the option of using the curb rein if the horse began to pull too much.\n\nMany eventers also used to ride with the double bridle when going cross-country on exceptionally high-strung horses. However, this practice has fallen out of favor, with most riders preferring the pelham instead, which is less harsh should the rider accidentally make a mistake. Additionally, the pelham could be used with bit converters, which allowed for one rein and made the bit much easier to handle.\n\nThe double bridle differs from the usual snaffle bridle in that it consists of four reins attached to two separate bits: the bradoon-style snaffle and a curb. The curb bit hangs down from the main headstall, and the bradoon has a separate, simpler headstall made from a narrow piece of leather known as a \"bradoon hanger\" or a \"slip head.\" The bradoon headstall lies under the curb headstall, with the browband of the bridle holding both pieces, as well as the cavesson all together as a single unit.\n\nA bradoon is a snaffle bit designed specifically for use in the double bridle. The bit mouthpiece is usually single-jointed, and the bit ring is usually a loose-ring, less often an eggbutt, or baucher. The rings are smaller in diameter (maximum 8 centimeters) than a regular snaffle bit, and for USDF competition, the mouthpiece must be at least 3/8\" in diameter when used on a horse, with smaller diameters allowed for ponies. It is especially important to choose a bradoon that is the correct width. A bradoon that is too wide may get caught on top of the port of the curb bit and push the bridoon's joint upward into the upper palate, while one that is too narrow will pinch the horse's skin against his molars. Both cases are painful and should be avoided. In general, the bradoon should be about 1/2\" wider than the Weymouth.\n\nThe curb bit, or Weymouth, consists of a mouthpiece with shanks and a curb chain. In USDF competition, the lower shank may be no longer than 10 cm (about 4\") in length. With a sliding mouthpiece, this measurement is taken when the mouthpiece is at its highest point. The width of the curb bit is also important: a curb that is too narrow will cause the shanks to pinch the lips, one that is too wide will cause the lips to be pinched between the curb and the curb chain and may also cause it to lie unevenly in the mouth. The upper shank should bend slightly outward, to prevent it from pinching when the reins are pulled. The severity of the curb is determined by several factors: longer shanks are considered more severe, as are tighter or thinner curb chains and higher ports.\n\nThe bradoon always lies higher in the horse's mouth than the curb bit, and is placed above the curb chain. It is common to place the bradoon a bit higher in the mouth than a snaffle used alone, because it is less likely to get caught on the curb. However, it is important that the bits do not lie too far apart from each other within the mouth, as the tongue may be caught between the two. In general, both bits are chosen to be slightly thinner. Although this increases their severity, most horses prefer thinner bits because it allows for more room for the tongue, which can be uncomfortably cramped with two thick bits sharing the space.\n\nThe bradoon rein should be wider than the rein used on the curb bit and in sport horse disciplines is often a bit more grippy (laced or, less often, rubber reins are popular), while the curb rein is thinner and smooth. This makes it easy for the rider to distinguish the two by feel. The extra grip provided by the snaffle rein also helps prevent the horse from pulling it through the rider's hands, which would make the curb rein shorter in comparison and encourage the rider to over-use the curb rein.\n\nWhen using a double bridle, a cavesson is always used. It should not be adjusted too low, as it may cause the skin and lip to pinch between it and the bradoon. Some riders use a padded crownpiece because the curb places pressure on the poll.\n\nThe bradoon bit works like any other snaffle, placing pressure on the lips, tongue, and to some extent the bars of the mouth. In the classical dressage tradition, the bradoon is used to regulate horizontal flexion (bending the horse left and right) and impulsion (faster and slower). Any action that is meant to place pressure on one side of the mouth must be performed with the bradoon, because the curb is designed in such a way that a pull on one rein will produce equal pressure across the tongue and bars, unless it is extremely harsh. Additionally, use of only one rein of the curb causes the bit to twist in the mouth and the chain to pinch.\n\nThe curb bit places pressure on the bars, the palate (especially if the port of the curb bit is fairly large), and via the curb chain, the poll and chin groove. It is used to regulate vertical flexion (cresting the neck and collecting the body through an arched spine), and the poll pressure asks the horse to lower the poll and telescope the neck to raise the base of the neck. If the horse tries to push his nose outward without permission from the rider, the curb reins will automatically come into play and tighten, asking the horse to flex. If the horse stiffens, adding slight poll and tongue pressure with the curb can ask him to relax at the poll.\nA rider may increase pressure on the \"curb alone\" by lifting their hands forward and upward. The hands remain the same distance from the bradoon because they move around a circle that is a radius equal to that of the bradoon rein. Therefore, the action of the bradoon does not come into play. However, because the curb rein is several inches below the bradoon, raising the hands pull upward on the bit and engages the shank.\n\nWhen used in Saddle seat tradition, particularly in the United States, the bradoon is used both to raise the head and turn, while the curb is used to lower the head, soften the jaw, and to slow the horse. In saddle seat riding, contact is to be maintained equally on all four reins.\n\nIn modern dressage, most riders employing the double bridle \"ride on the bradoon.\" In other words, they keep a steady contact with the bradoon bit and only engage the curb bit to when necessary to encourage the horse to collect. As a result, the bradoon rein keeps slightly more pressure, and the curb rein, although in contact, is much softer. In competition, total loss of rein contact of the curb (which will result in the rein being bowed) will cause a severe deduction from the rider's score. To ride mainly from the bradoon while still keeping a soft contact on the curb, the rider must have steady, soft hands and a correct hand position. To activate the bradoon separately from the curb, if the rider is using the most common rein holds (described below), the rider simply rotates the lower fingers into the hand and slightly upward, which will tighten pressure on the bradoon. The upper part of the hand, where the curb is held, remains in the same point in space and acts as a pivot, so that the pressure on the curb does not change.\n\nRiders must be skilled before attempting to use the double bridle, and the horse should be far enough along in his training that the double bridle would be accepted and understood. It is a refined piece of equipment that can greatly enhance the riding in good hands, or destroy the animal's training and mouth. Because it uses two bits, it has a much greater chance of damaging the horse's mouth if used incorrectly.\n\nThe rider must have an independent seat and soft hands. Additionally, they should be able to keep their horse moving uphill with elevated shoulders, or else activating the curb will cause him to hollow, fall onto the forehand, and flex incorrectly at the 3rd vertebra rather than the poll. The rider must also take care to determine if a double bridle is proper for the individual horse's training and temperament. Certain sensitive horses will do better if kept in a snaffle for a longer period of time. Horses that tend to be lazy or behind their rider's leg will also become more so if ridden in double bridle before they are consistently forward.\n\nOveruse of the curb will cause the horse to go behind the bit, open his mouth, draw his tongue back in his mouth to escape the pressure, or damage the tongue. Additionally, it can cause unpure gaits, including a \"pacey\" walk, a stiff trot, and a 4-beat canter. Overuse of the somewhat thin bradoon can lead to a hard mouth, and in severe cases, cause sores or bleeding at the corners of the mouth.\n\nIf a running martingale is used with a double bridle, only the snaffle reins should run through the rings. Running curb reins through the martingale creates excessive amounts of leverage and can cause pain to the horse if misused. While fox hunters once were known to ride with a running martingale attached to the curb rein, today this practice is relatively non-existent, partly because the double bridle is only common in equestrian disciplines that usually do not use a running martingale. However, if a running martingale is used on the curb, however ill-advised, it is extremely important to use rein stops, as the martingale ring is sometimes larger than the ring on the curb bit shank, and can get caught on the bit with potentially disastrous consequences.\n\nWhen first learning to use the double bridle, it can be helpful to gain experience holding and manipulating two reins without actually using the more severe curb. To do so, the rider may place two reins on the snaffle. A rider may also ride on contact with the snaffle rein, keeping the curb rein loose until the hold becomes comfortable and familiar.\n\nThere are several types of rein holds which offer various degrees of action between both bits.\n\nThe traditional cavalry hold has the rider place all four reins in the left hand; in this way, the right hand is left free to hold a sword, lance, or other weapon. The precise order of reins has varied from era to era, from country to country, and to suit specific circumstances of battle or pageantry. In every case, a great deal of precise control is needed to selectively engage the bradoon or curb independently. Less schooled troopers may ride while engaging only a single pair of reins for one bit, and allowing the reins for the second bit to bow and thereby apply only the passive effect of gravity on that bit.\n\nThis rein hold is also seen in competitive dressage, during FEI freestyle tests. It demonstrates the horse's throughness, self-carriage, and obedience due to the fact that the rider has little control with the reins except to create flexion. When used, it can increase the difficulty of the movement, thereby helping the rider attain a higher score if executed well.\n\n\"2 to 2 holds\" involve the rider holding two reins in each hand. The two most commonly used in the United States allow for softer use of the curb rein. In one such hold, the rider holds the bradoon rein under the fourth finger (pinkie or little finger), and the curb between the third and fourth fingers. In the second method, the bradoon is held between the third (ring) and fourth finger, and the curb between the second and third fingers. The latter is in some ways preferable, because the rider continues to hold the snaffle rein between the ring finger and pinkie, in the same manner as when riding with a snaffle alone, and so will already have the feel developed for that use. Additionally, pressure from the bradoon rein pushing on the underside of the little finger can encourage riders to raise their hands, because it will feel as if there is not longer a perfectly straight line from elbow to bit. In either case, the reins cross one another, the rider should be sure that the curb rein crosses \"under\" the bradoon when the horse is viewed from the side, so that it is closer to the neck. Both these holds allow for the rider to flex his or her hand and apply slightly more contact to the bradoon than to the curb, allowing it to be softer.\n\nIn both cases, the ends of the reins usually leave the fist between the thumb and index finger, as seen when riding with just a snaffle rein. However, another variation allows the end of the snaffle rein to leave between the first and second fingers, and the end of the curb to leave between the thumb and first finger. This allows the rider to easily identify each rein and adjust the tension on each. It also helps to avoid too much tension on the curb rein.\nThere are several rein holds which increase the ratio of curb to bradoon pressure. In all these cases, the curb rein is held lower down in the hand than the bradoon, so that the two reins do not cross when the horse is viewed from the side. As the distance increases between where the two reins insert into the hand, the curb reins becomes more and more prominent when rein pressure is applied. This is because the curb has greater action when the lower part of the hand is flexed back. This hold is usually used if the horse is especially hard-mouthed, easily distractible, or needs a bit more curb action because he tries to raise his head. It should only be applied by riders with exceptionally soft hands who have a good foundation in using the double bridle.\n\nTwo of the mild forms of this type of hold involve the curb rein either under the fourth finger, or between the fourth and third finger, while holding the bradoon between the second and third fingers.\n\nThe most extreme form of this is called the \"Fillis Hold\", named after James Fillis. It involves the curb rein being held under the pinkie, and the bradoon rein held like a driving rein, between the thumb and first finger. The two reins therefore insert into the hand as far away as they possibly could and allow each set to be used with considerable leverage. Therefore, either rein can be used without the influence of the other, simply by rotating the lower or upper part of the hand back. This hold is commonly seen used (correctly) by the dressage rider Philipe Karl. However, when used incorrectly, which can be extremely easy to do even by excellent riders, it causes the horse to flex at the third vertebra instead of the poll, a major fault.\n\nIn the 3 to 1 rein hold, one hand (historically, the left hand) holds three reins and the other only one rein. The three-rein hand controls both curb reins and the bradoon rein which belongs to that side, and the other hand simply holds the other bradoon rein and the whip. It is a hold that was common to the classical dressage tradition. Today the 3 to 1 rein hold is used while training, rather than competition, although it is still seen used by the Spanish Riding School.\n\nThe left hand holds the left bradoon rein below the fourth finger (pinkie), the left hand curb rein between the third and fourth fingers, and the right hand curb between the second and third fingers. It is held right over the pommel of the saddle. The right hand holds the bradoon as it would normally hold a snaffle (between the third and fourth fingers), and the hand is held very close to the left hand. This hold has several important consequences: it decreases the action of the curb, it prevents the rider from riding with their hands too wide or performing an overzealous opening rein with their left hand, and it shows when the horse is not properly straight, because the rider can no longer make the rein pressure on one side of the mouth any stronger than the other, since reins from both sides are held in the left hand. The rider must ride off the seat and legs to bend the horse, and the horse must therefore be properly \"through\".\n\nThe bridoon reins are dropped on the neck near the withers, and contact is kept only with the curb, both reins being held in the left hand. This means that the rider must have good hands, a well-developed seat, and the horse must accept the bit, or else the horse will end up overbent. The rider can only create bend in the horse with the seat and legs, not the hands.\n\nThe whip is held upright in the right hand, going back to the tradition where the sword would be held in such a way as a salute. This method is rarely practiced today, although still seen used by the Spanish Riding School, the Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre, and the mounted troops of the household cavalry in London, England.\n\nThe method is also mandatory at the higher levels of the equestrian discipline of Working Equitation.\n\nA distantly related variation on the English double bridle is the \"two rein\" setup used in the western riding classic vaquero tradition (also known as the \"buckaroo\" or \"California\" tradition) of developing a \"spade bit\" horse. Rather than use of a bit and bradoon, the trainer uses a thin bosal style hackamore over a complex type of curb bit known as a spade. This tradition originated with the same haute ecole and military uses of horses in the Middle Ages, but developed differently from classical dressage since approximately the 16th century, when Spanish horse trainers arrived in the Americas. In this tradition, the ultimate goal is use of one hand on the spade alone. A young horse is started in a bosal, then is transitioned into the spade by wearing both the spade bit with progressively smaller diameter bosals, with the rider usually carrying the reins in the 3 in 1 hold. The reins of the spade bit are romal style, with light chains or small lead weights added between the bit and the rein so that it balances perfectly in the mouth of the horse. Over time the trainer uses the bosal less and less until the horse travels with lightness and collection on the spade alone. The process of moving from a bosal alone to a \"straight up\" spade bit horse using the spade alone can take many years, as long as it takes to bring a Dressage horse to Grand Prix level. For practical working purposes, the modern cowboy of the vaquero or \"buckaroo\" tradition usually keeps a light bosal on the finished horse as a type of noseband.\n\n\n"}

The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins; while heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning where, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either a complex single occurrence of sexual intercourse, separate occurrences of sexual intercourse, or through artificial insemination.\n\nSuperfecundation most commonly happens within hours or days of the first instance of fertilization with ova released during the same cycle. The time window when eggs are able to be fertilized is small. Sperm cells can live inside a female's body for three days. Once ovulation occurs, the egg remains viable for 12–48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. Thus, the fertile period can span five to seven days.\n\nOvulation is usually suspended during pregnancy to prevent further ova becoming fertilized and to help increase the chances of a full-term pregnancy. However, if an ovum is released after the female was already impregnated when previously ovulating, a chance of a second pregnancy occurs, albeit at a different stage of development. This is known as superfetation.\n\nHeteropaternal superfecundation is common in animals such as cats and dogs. Stray dogs can produce litters in which every puppy has a different sire. Though rare in humans, cases have been documented. In one study on humans, the frequency was 2.4% among dizygotic twins whose parents had been involved in paternity suits.\n\nHellenism holds many cases of superfecundation:\n\nIn 1982, twins who were born with two different skin colors were discovered to be conceived as a result of heteropaternal superfecundation.\n\nIn 1995, a young woman gave birth to diamniotic monochorionic twins, who were originally assumed to be monozygotic twins until a paternity suit led to a DNA test. This led to the discovery that the twins had different fathers.\n\nIn 2001, a case of spontaneous monopaternal superfecundation was reported after a woman undergoing IVF treatments gave birth to quintuplets after only two embryos were implanted. Genetic testing supported that the twinning was not a result of the embryos splitting, and that all five boys shared the same father.\n\nIn 2016, an IVF-implanted surrogate mother gave birth to two children: one genetically unrelated child from an implanted embryo, and a biological child from her own egg and her husband's sperm.\n\nIn 2019, a Chinese woman was reported to have two babies from different fathers, one of whom was her husband and the other was a man having a secret affair with her during the same time.\n\n\n"}

Used for disaster recovery, Parallel Sysplex combines data sharing and parallel computing to allow a cluster of up to 32 systems to share a workload for high performance and high availability.\n\nIn 1990, IBM mainframe computers introduced the concept of a Systems Complex, commonly called a Sysplex, with MVS/ESA SPV4.1. This allows authorized components in up to eight logical partitions (\"LPARs\") to communicate and cooperate with each other using the XCF protocol.\n\nComponents of a Sysplex include:\n\nUsers of a (base) Sysplex include: \n\nThe Parallel Sysplex was introduced with the addition of the Coupling Facility (CF) with coupling links for high speed communication, with MVS/ESA V5.1 operating system support, together with the mainframe models in April 1994.\n\nThe Coupling Facility (CF) may reside on a dedicated stand-alone server configured with processors that can run Coupling Facility control code (CFCC), as integral processors on the mainframes themselves configured as ICFs (Internal Coupling Facilities), or less common, as normal LPARs. The CF contains Lock, List, and Cache structures to help with serialization, message passing, and buffer consistency between multiple LPARs.\n\nThe primary goal of a Parallel Sysplex is to provide data sharing capabilities, allowing multiple databases for direct reads and writes to shared data. This can provide benefits of \n\nDatabases running on the System z server that can take advantage of this include: \n\nOther components can use the Coupling Facility to help with system management, performance, or reduced hardware requirements. Called “Resource Sharing”, uses include: \nTape Switching uses the GRS structure to provide sharing of tape units between z/OS images. \n\nMulti-system enclave management for improved performance \n\nMajor components of a Parallel Sysplex include:\nThe Coupling Facility may be either a dedicated external system (a small mainframe, such as a System z9 BC, specially configured with only coupling facility processors) or integral processors on the mainframes themselves configured as ICFs (Internal Coupling Facilities). It is recommended that at least one external CF be used in a parallel sysplex. It is recommended that a Parallel Sysplex has at least two CFs and/or ICFs for redundancy, especially in a production data sharing environment. Server Time Protocol (STP) replaced the Sysplex Timers beginning in 2005 for System z mainframe models z990 and newer. A Sysplex Timer is a physically separate piece of hardware from the mainframe, whereas STP is an integral facility within the mainframe's microcode.\nWith STP and ICFs it is possible to construct a complete Parallel Sysplex installation with two connected mainframes. Moreover, a single mainframe can contain the internal equivalent of a complete physical Parallel Sysplex, useful for application testing and development purposes.\n\nThe IBM Systems Journal dedicated a full issue to all the technology components.\n\nMaintaining accurate time is important in computer systems. For example, in a transaction-processing system the recovery process reconstructs the transaction data from log files. If time stamps are used for transaction-data logging, and the time stamps of two related transactions are transposed from the actual sequence, then the reconstruction of the transaction database may not match the state before the recovery process. \nServer Time Protocol (STP) can be used to provide a single time source between multiple servers. Based on Network Time Protocol concepts, one of the System z servers is designated by the HMC as the primary time source (Stratum 1). It then sends timing signals to the Stratum 2 servers through use of coupling links. The Stratum 2 servers in turn send timing signals to the Stratum 3 servers. To provide availability, one of the servers can be designated as a backup time source, and a third server can be designated as an “Arbiter” to assist the Backup Time Server in determining if it should take the role of the Primary during exception conditions.\n\nSTP has been available on System z servers since 2005.\n\nMore information on STP is available in “Server Time Protocol Planning Guide”\n\nGeographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS) is an extension of Parallel Sysplex of mainframes located, potentially, in different cities.

Konstantin stated in his charter to the Saint George Monastery near Skopje that Stefan Nemanja of Serbia was his grandfather. The Byzantine historian, George Pachymeres, described him as a \"half-Serbian\". He could have been related to the Serbian royal house through either his mother or father. If he was a patrilinear relative of Nemanja, his father, Tih, may have been the son of Nemanja's brother, Tihomir, according to historian Srdjan Pirivatrić. Pirivatrić and other scholars also say, Konstantin may have been a son or a nephew of the Bulgarian boyar John Tihomir, who controlled Skopje in the late 12th century. If Konstantin was related to the Serbian royal house through his mother, a daughter or a niece of Nemanja must have been his mother.\n\nKonstantin Tich mounted the Bulgarian throne after the death of Michael II Asen, but the circumstances of his ascension are obscure. Michael Asen was murdered by his cousin, Kaliman in late 1256 or early 1257. Before long, Kaliman was also killed, and the male line of the Asen dynasty died out.\n\nRostislav Mikhailovich, Duke of Macsó (who was Michael and Kaliman's father-in-law), and the boyar Mitso (who was Michael's brother-in-law), laid claim to Bulgaria. Rostislav captured Vidin, Mitso held sway over southeastern Bulgaria, but none of them could secure the support of the boyars who controlled Tarnovo. The latter offered the throne Konstantin who accepted the election.\n\nKonstantin divorced his first wife (whose name is unknown), and married Irene Doukaina Laskarina in 1258. Irene was the daughter of Theodore II Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea, and Elena of Bulgaria, a daughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. The marriage with a descendant of the Bulgarian royal family strengthened his position. He was thereafter called Konstantin Asen. The marriage also forged an alliance between Bulgaria and Nicaea, which was confirmed one or two years later, when the Byzantine historian and official George Akropolites came to Tarnovo.\n\nRostislav Mikhailovich invaded Bulgaria with Hungarian assistance in 1259. In the following year, Rostislav left his duchy to join the campaign of his father-in-law, Béla IV of Hungary, against Bohemia. Taking advantage of Rostislav's absence, Konstantin broke into his realm and reoccupied Vidin. He also sent an army to attack the Banate of Severin, but the Hungarian commander, Lawrence, fought the invaders off.\n\nThe Bulgarian invasion of Severin outraged Béla IV. Soon after he concluded a peace treaty with Ottokar II of Bohemia in March 1261, Hungarian troops stormed into Bulgaria under the command of Béla IV's son and heir, Stephen. They captured Vidin and besieged Lom on the Lower Danube, but they were unable to bring Konstantin to a pitched battle, because he withdrew to Tarnovo. The Hungarian army left Bulgaria before the end of the year, but the campaign restored northwestern Bulgaria to Rostislav.\n\nKonstantin's minor brother-in-law, John IV Laskaris, was dethroned and blinded by his former guardian and co-ruler, Michael VIII Palaiologos, before the end of 1261. Michael VIII's army had occupied Constantinople already in July, thus the coup made him the sole ruler of the restored Byzantine Empire. The rebirth of the empire changed the traditional relations between the powers of the Balkan Peninsula. Furthermore, Konstantine's wife decided to take vengeance of her brother's mutilation and persuaded Konstantine to turn against Michael.\n\nMitso, who still held southeastern Bulgaria, made an alliance with the Byzantines, but another powerful nobleman, Jacob Svetoslav, who had taken control of the southwestern region, was loyal to Konstantine. Benefiting from a war between the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice, Achaea and Epirus, Konstantine invaded Thrace and captured Stanimaka and Philippopolis (now Asenovgrad and Plovdiv in Bulgaria) in the autumn of 1262. Mitso was also forced to flee to Mesembria (now Nesebar in Bulgaria). After Konstantine laid siege to the town, Mitso sought assistance from the Byzantines, offering to surrender Mesembria to them in exchange for landed property in the Byzantine Empire. Michael VIII accepted the offer and sent Michael Glabas Tarchaneiotes to help Mitso in 1263.\n\nA second Byzantine army stormed into Thrace and recaptured Stanimaka and Philippopolis. After seizing Mesembria from Mitso, Glabas Tarchaneiotes continued his campaign along the Black Sea and occupied Agathopolis, Sozopolis and Anchialos (now Ahtopol, Sozopol and Pomorie in Bulgaria). Meanwhile, the Byzantine fleet took control of Vicina and other ports at the Danube Delta. Glabas Tarchaneiotes attacked Jacob Svetoslav who could only resist with Hungarian assistance, thus he accepted Béla IV's suzerainty.\n\nAs a consequence of the war with the Byzantines, by the end of 1263, Bulgaria lost significant territories to his two principal enemies, the Byzantine Empire and Hungary. Konstantin could only seek assistance from the Tatars of the Golden Horde to put an end to his isolation. The Tatar khans had been the overlords of the Bulgarian monarchs for almost two decades, although their rule was only formal. A former Sultan of Rum, Kaykaus II, who had been imprisoned at Michael VIII's order, also wanted to regain his throne with the Tatars' help. One of his uncles was a prominent leader of the Golden Horde and he sent messages to him to persuade the Tatars to invade the Byzantine Empire with Bulgarian assistance. According to the Byzantine historian, Nicephorus Gregoras, Kaykaus also approached Konstantin, offering much money to him if he came to release him.\n\nThousands of Tatars crossed the frozen Lower Danube to invade the Byzantine Empire in late 1264. Konstantin soon joined them, although he had fallen from a horse and broken his leg. The united Tatar and Bulgarian armies launched a sudden attack against Michael VIII who was returning from Thessaly to Constantinople, but they could not capture the emperor. Konstantin laid siege the Byzantine fortress of Ainos (now Enez in Turkey), forcing the defenders to surrender. The Byzantines also agreed to release Kaykaus (who soon left for the Golden Horde), but his family was kept imprisoned even thereafter.\n\nKonstantine's alliance with the Tatars strengthened his position. Jacob Svetoslav again accepted his suzerainty. Taking advantage of a civil war in Hungary, Jacob Svetoslav also invaded the Banate of Severin. The Hungarian civil war ended with the division of the country between Béla IV and Stephen in March 1266. Stephen launched a military campaign against Bulgaria and captured Vidin in June. Konstantin tried to resist, but the Hungarians defeated his army and plundered the region of Tarnovo. The Hungarians captured Pleven and other fortresses on the Danube and forced Jacob Svetoslav to again do homage to Stephen. Thereafter Jacob Svetoslav was styled as \"emperor of Bulgaria\" in the Hungarian royal charters.\n\nCharles I of Sicily and Baldwin II, the dispossessed Latin Emperor of Constantinople, made an alliance against the Byzantine Empire in 1267. To prevent Bulgaria from joining the anti-Byzantine coalition, Michael VIII offered his niece, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, to the widowed Konstantin in 1268. The emperor also pledged that he would return Mesembria and Anchialos to Bulgaria as her dowry if she gave birth to a son. Konstantin married Maria, but Michael VIII broke his promise and did not renounce the two towns after the birth of Konstantin and Maria's son, Michael. Outraged by the emperor's betrayal, Konstantin sent envoys to Charles to Naples in September 1271. The negotiations continued during the following years, showing that Konstantin was willing to support Charles against the Byzantines.\n\nKonstantin broke into Thrace in 1271 or 1272, but Michael VIII persuaded Nogai, the dominant figure in the westernmost territory of the Golden Horde, to invade Bulgaria. The Tatars plundered the country, forcing Konstantin to return and abandon his claim to the two towns. Nogai set up his capital in Isaccea near the Danube Delta, thus he could easily attack Bulgaria.\n\nKonstantin had been seriously injured after a riding accident and could not move without assistance, because he was paralyzed from the waist down. His ambitious wife took control of the government. After Michael VIII's envoys accepted Pope Gregory X's proposal to a church union at the Second Council of Lyon in summer 1274, she became one of the leading opponents of the union. She even tried to persuade Baibars, the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, to attack the Byzantine Empire. Maria was also determined to secure the throne to her son. Jacob Svetoslav, however, had a strong claim to succeed Konstantin, because his wife was a granddaughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. Maria first adopted Jacob Svetoslav to persuade him to acknowledge her son's right to the throne, but later she had him poisoned. He also had other noblemen captured or executed, which made Konstantin's rule unpopular.\n\nThe paralyzed Konstantin could not prevent Nogai's Tatars from making regular plundering raids against Bulgaria. The local inhabitants of the regions which were most exposed to the Tatar raids had to organize the defense without the monarch's support.\n\nDue to the expensive and unsuccessful wars, repeated Mongol raids, and economic instability (Constantine was the first Bulgarian ruler to mint his own coins on a vast scale), the government was faced with a revolt in 1277. The social and economic aspects of this movement have been stressed by Marxist historians, but its true character is elusive. What is clear is that a swineherd or swine-owner named Ivaylo became a leader of the discontented and attracted many (presumably mostly lower-class followers, asserting his control over a significant area. Constantine set out against Ivaylo with his guard, but was decisively defeated and slain in his chariot.\n\nConstantine I was married three times. The names of his first wife and children are unknown. By his second wife, Irene of Nicaea, Constantine had no children. By his third wife, Maria Kantakouzene, he had Michael, who succeeded as co-emperor of Bulgaria 1277–1279.\n\n"}

Before the questions begin, Happy starts to praise the qualities of Milady Soap, but Beauregard says that it works just like any other soap, outraging Waters. Beauregard easily answers correctly the maximum six questions, then requests one more, which he also answers correctly, earning $320. Beauregard turns down the money and asks to return next week.\n\nWaters decides to invite Beauregard back for one question per show for six weeks and heavily publicizes it. During that time, \"Masquerade for Money\" tops the ratings, and sales of Milady Soap skyrocket.\n\nAt the end of that time, Waters approves of giving Beauregard an impossibly hard question, but when Beauregard answers it correctly, Waters becomes uneasy. Happy offers to take piano lessons from Gwenn to try to find a weakness in Beauregard. Beauregard sees through the scheme, but Gwenn sneaks out on a date with Happy anyway. When Gwenn tells Happy that she and her brother think that he is just trying to get information from her, he admits that he is but also says that he is glad to have met her. Gwenn tells Happy that Beauregard intends to win $40 million, to take everything that Waters has. Happy tells Waters, who cancels the show and sends Beauregard a check for his current winnings ($40,000), which Beauregard refuses to accept.\n\nAfter the show cancellation causes Milady Soap sales to plummet, Waters is forced to reinstate the show, and Beauregard reaches $10 million. Waters calls in a scheming \"Flame\" O'Neill (Celeste Holm) to distract Beauregard. Beauregard catches a cold from being in a driving rainstorm, so Flame pretends to be a nurse to him. Beauregard is aware of, but nevertheless quickly succumbs to, Flame's charms (as does Waters). Flame breaks her dinner date with Beauregard to undermine his self-confidence and peace of mind. The night of the show, Beauregard reveals that he (supposedly) never mastered Albert Einstein's \"space-time theories\". The next question is, of course, about Einstein's views of space-time. Realizing Flame has betrayed him, Beauregard initially struggles but eventually comes up with an answer. Happy says that Beauregard's answer is incorrect and intends to reward him the consolation prize of Milady Soap. However, Einstein himself calls on the telephone before the end of the show to say that Beauregard's answer is correct, whereupon Happy acknowledges on-air that Beauregard's answer is correct after all. Afterward, Beauregard confronts Flame, who has fallen for him. Unaware of Flame's supposed newly found fondness for him, Beauregard spanks her with her hairbrush and informs her that he deliberately misled her, that he actually \"spent an entire season with Einstein\", but also admits that he fell madly in love with her.\n\nWaters books the Hollywood Bowl for the last show. Happy and Gwenn, and Beauregard and Flame, each plan to marry. Beauregard and Gwenn caution each other that their would-be spouses could be just after the money. Each calls and suggests marrying \"before\" the show, but Happy and Flame each come up with excuses.\n\nFor the final quiz show question, Happy asks Beauregard what his Social Security number is. Beauregard answers incorrectly. After the show, to the joy of Beauregard and Gwenn, Flame and Happy still want to marry them. Waters shows up at Beauregard's home, bearing gifts, including champagne. (Caesar used to be Waters' pet.) As Beauregard and Flame drive to Las Vegas to get married, Beauregard reveals that he and Waters had made a deal in which Beauregard would lose in exchange for getting his own radio show, some stock, and other considerations. Maybe Beauregard was motivated to make such a deal because two T men (Brian O'Hara, Jack Daly) had signaled their intent to tax a significant amount of his winnings. Beauregard then admits that he actually did not know the answer. (Or so Beauregard said. Since Beauregard had to know his own Social Security number to complete job applications, it is inconceivable that he really didn't know it. The only reasonable inference fulfilling all of the parameters is that Beauregard blanked out on the show when presented the question.)\n\nIn his 1950 review of the film in \"The New York Times\", Bosley Crowther panned the film, sparing only Holm:\n\n\"Some of his [Vincent Price's] broad aberrations offer faintly satirical thrusts at advertising genius, but most of them are duds. Mr. Coleman's exquisite urbanity wears awfully thin as time goes on. ... With Celeste Holm playing the charmer, there is some evident reason, at least, for the hero's infatuation. But with a chap named Art Linkletter cast as the quiz-master, we cannot fathom the basis for the sister's romance.\"\nContemporary criticism of the story indicated that the film violated Beauregard's criticism of the nature of quiz shows in its final plot twist, with Beauregard being given his own quiz show - unless Beauregard were to use the opportunity to reform quiz shows by having one that is truly intellectually stimulating.\n\nNicholas Laham has analysed the treatment of Beauregard as a highly educated, yet unemployable, character in the context of how scholars were regarded in the 1950s, and in anticipation of the unemployment of information-based, highly educated people in later decades in the information age/\"new economy\". Laham also places \"Champagne for Caesar\" in the historical lineage of screwball comedy, over a decade after that genre had reached its peak before World War II.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301383", "title": "Logical partition", "text": "Logical partition\n\nA logical partition (LPAR) is a subset of a computer's hardware resources, virtualized as a separate computer. In effect, a physical machine can be partitioned into multiple logical partitions, each hosting a separate instance of an operating system.\n\nIBM developed the concept of hypervisors (virtual machines in CP-40 and CP-67) and in 1972 provided it for the S/370 as Virtual Machine Facility/370. IBM introduced the Start Interpretive Execution (SIE) instruction (designed specifically for the execution of virtual machines) as part of 370-XA architecture on the 3081, as well as VM/XA versions of VM to exploit it. PR/SM is a type-1 Hypervisor based on the CP component of VM/XA that runs directly on the machine level and allocates system resources across LPARs to share physical resources. It is a standard feature on IBM System z only. An IBM POWER system uses PHYP (the POWER Hypervisor) to enable its LPAR functionalities for System p and System i since approximately 2000 in POWER4 systems.\n\nThe terms \"PR/SM\" and \"LPAR\" are often used interchangeably in IBM Z, including in IBM documentation. Formally, LPAR designates the logical partitioning function and mode of operation, whereas PR/SM is the commercial designation of the feature.\n\nAmdahl Corporation's Multiple Domain Facility (MDF) was introduced in 1982. IBM began marketing its functionally similar PR/SM in 1988, implemented on its ESA/390 architecture released that year. MDF-based LPAR technology continued to be developed separately by Amdahl, and Hitachi Data Systems in part for their implementations of the new architecture, which featured the introduction of access registers that allowed use of multiple data spaces addressable by a single address space. IBM subsequently continued its LPAR development with its 64-bit System z and System i architectures. LPAR and PR/SM reconfigurations can be made without rebooting the computer, i.e., while some LPARs remain active. Reconfigurations can include changing channel path definitions and device definitions.\n\nz/VM supports the z/Architecture HiperSockets function for high-speed TCP/IP communication among virtual machines and logical partitions (LPARs) within the same IBM zSeries server. This function uses an adaptation of the Queued-Direct Input/Output (QDIO) high-speed I/O protocol.\n\nIBM later introduced LPARs to their iSeries and pSeries servers in 1999 and 2001, respectively, albeit with varying technical specifications. Multiple operating systems are compatible with LPARs, including z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, z/TPF, AIX, Linux, and i/OS. In storage systems, such as the IBM TotalStorage DS8000, LPARs allow for multiple virtual instances of a storage array to exist within a single physical array.\n\nIn first part of 2010 year, Fujitsu announced availability of its x86 64 PRIMEQUEST line of servers, which support LPARs.\n\nIn second part of 2011 year, Hitachi has announced availability of CB2000 and CB320 blade systems, which support LPAR on x86 64 hardware.\n\nLogical partitioning divides hardware resources. Two LPARs may access memory from a common memory chip, provided that the ranges of addresses directly accessible to each do not overlap. It is possible for one partition to control memory managed by a second partition indirectly by communicating with a process on the partition with direct access, which acts as an intermediary. CPUs may be dedicated to a single LPAR or shared. While on Amdahl's MDF(Multiple Domain Facility) it was possible to configure an LPAR with both shared and dedicated CPUs. This is no longer possible with any mainframes currently in the market.\n\nOn IBM mainframes, LPARs are managed by the PR/SM facility or a related, optional, simplified facility called Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM). All 64-bit IBM mainframes, except for the first generation 64-bit models (z900 and z800), operate exclusively in LPAR mode, even when there is only one partition on a machine. Multiple LPARs running z/OS can form a Sysplex or Parallel Sysplex, whether on one machine or spread across multiple machines.\n\nOn IBM System p POWER hardware, LPARs are managed by PHYP (the POWER Hypervisor). PHYP acts as a virtual switch between the LPARs and also handles the virtual SCSI traffic between LPARs. Micro-Partitioning supports 10 times as many LPARs as processors with fractional allocations. It was introduced with the POWER5 processor. All IBM POWER5, POWER6, and successor systems may be partitioned. Note that a full system partition may be defined where all resources are consumed by a single partition. System P servers with PowerVM enabled allow LPARs with shared CPUs to delegate their unused cycles into the shared pool. Dedicated processors are not available for sharing. Unused cycles become available for other partitions and are governed by the parameters specified when the LPAR is defined. Changes to a running partition can be made dynamically up to the maximum value set, and down to the minimum value set in the active profile. The changing of resource allocations without restart of the logical partition is called dynamic logical partitioning. IBM PowerVM is the licensed/purchased feature that enables the virtualization features on p4, 5, 6, 7, and subsequent series servers.\n\nExploiting Intel vPro (i.e. Non-uniform memory access), there are also implementations of Logical Partitioning based on Intel Xeon e.g. by Hitachi Data Systems.\n\nLPARs (with sufficient certification) safely allow combining multiple test, development, quality assurance, and production work on the same server, offering advantages such as lower costs, faster deployment, and more convenience. IBM mainframe LPARs are Common Criteria certifiable, equivalent to physically unconnected servers, so they support the highest security requirements, including military use. Nearly all IBM mainframes run with multiple LPARs with the IBM System z9 and IBM System z10 supporting up to 60 LPARs and later models up to 85.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Changzhou County (長洲縣, not Changzhou), now part of Suzhou, in Jiangsu Province.\n\nFeng was born into a scholar-bureaucrat gentry household, where he and his brothers Feng Menggui () and Feng Mengxiong () were educated in the classics and the traditional arts of the gentleman. He and his brothers, all well-known as accomplished writers, artists, and poets, became known collectively as the \"Three Fengs of the Wu Area\" (). In spite of his literary talent and his zeal for scholarship from a young age, Feng sat the imperial civil service examinations many times without success, eventually giving up and making a living as a tutor and teacher.\n\nIn 1626, he narrowly avoided punishment after being implicated as an associate of Zhou Shunchang (), who was framed and purged by the corrupt eunuch Wei Zhongxian. Appalled by the injustice, he resolved to complete his trilogy of vernacular Chinese short story collections: \"Stories to Instruct the World\", \"Stories to Caution the World\", and \"Stories to Awaken the World\" (喻世明言, 警世通言, and 醒世恆言).\n\nIn recognition of his reputation as a writer, Feng was finally awarded the \"gongsheng\" degree in 1630 at the age of fifty-seven. In the subsequent year, he received his first government post as instructor of Dantu County (丹徒縣, today Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). In 1634, he was appointed magistrate of Shouning County () in Fujian. During his tenure, he became regarded as a morally upright and diligent administrator. He retired in 1638.\n\nIn 1644, the Ming state was thrown into turmoil by the sacking of Beijing by Li Zicheng's rebel army and invasion by the Manchu Qing forces. At the age of seventy-one, he published the \"Grand Proposals for National Rejuvenation\" () to inspire his countrymen to repel the invaders. He died in despair in 1646 as the Ming dynasty continued to collapse. Some works indicate or imply that he was killed by Qing soldiers.\n\nFeng's literary output consisted of the compilation of histories and local gazettes, the retelling of folktales and stories from antiquity in the form of short stories and plays, and the authorship of vernacular Chinese novels. Two of his noteworthy works are the \"Qing Shi\" (\"History of Love\", 情史), an anthology of classical love stories, and the shenmo novel \"Pingyao Zhuan\". In 1620 he published the \"Illustrious Words to Instruct the World\" (喻世明言 Yushi Mingyan), or \"Stories Old and New\", the first part of his well-known trilogy.\n\nFeng was a proponent of the school of Li Zhi, which supported the importance of human feelings and behavior in literature. He is frequently associated with Ling Mengchu, author of Slapping the Table in Amazement, a two-part collection of entertaining vernacular tales.\n\nFeng Menglong was in love with a famous prostitute when he was young. Unfortunately, Feng Menglong was not able to afford to redeem his lover out. At the end, his lover was redeemed by a merchant, and they had to leave each other. Feng Menglong suffered from pain and desperation due to the separation, and he expressed his sorrow through poems. This experience influenced the way he portrayed female characters in his stories. In fact, Feng Menglong was one of the few authors who portrayed female as being strong and intelligent; and this is different from other authors, where they tended to ignore the importance of female’s position. The female characters in Feng Menglong’s stories were portrayed as brave and bright when dealing with different situations. For instance, in his story Wan Xiuniang Takes Revenge Through Toy Pavilions from Jing Shi Tong Yan, Wan Xiuniang showed her braveness during her tough times, and she was able to escape using her intelligence. Other female characters, such as Du Shi-niang and Qu Xiuxiu, are example to show Feng Menglong’s respectful and sympathetic portrayal of female characters.\n\nFeng Menglong also expressed his attitudes towards society through his works, which were heavily influenced by his interactions with officialdom and the Chinese literati. Feng Menglong became the magistrate of Shouning near the end of his life, in his sixties. During his appointment, he sought to correct injustices and hoped to build up a reputation as an humble and upright official. Unfortunately, his efforts were frustrated by the widespread corruption of the late Ming dynasty (a theme also treated extensively in other contemporaneous works, such as Zhang Yingyu's \"The Book of Swindles\" (ca. 1617)); bribery and extortion were common bureaucratic behaviors, and themes of official malfeasance figure in many of Feng's stories. Realizing that atmosphere of corruption could not be easily changed, Feng Menglong conveyed his discontent and patriotism through words. Each character of his stories has strong and direct characteristics: there is a clear morality line drawn between “good” and “bad”. Moreover, the meaning behind the stories explores the social issues during Ming Dynasty. For instance, the stories of \"The White Maiden Locked for Eternity in Leifeng Pagoda\" and \"The Young Lady Gives the Young Man a Gift of Money\" from \"Stories to Caution the World\" express the idea of how women pursued their freedom and happiness under a patriarchal society.\n\nDuring his tenure as magistrate of Shouning, Feng learned of the local practice of drowning female infants in the river. He authored the \"Public Notice on the Prohibition of the Drowning of Daughters\" () to appeal to parents not to carry out what he viewed as an abhorrent custom and provide for punishments for infanticidal parents and rewards for those taking in abandoned children.\n\n\nSinger Yan Weiwen stars as Feng Menglong in the 2017 biographical film \"Feng Menglong's Legend\" ().\n\n\n"}

The convention was agreed upon at the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Conference on Road Traffic (7 October – 8 November 1968) and concluded in Vienna on 8 November 1968. It came into force on 21 May 1977. This conference also produced the Convention on Road Signs and Signals. The Convention had amendments on 3 September 1993 and 28 March 2006. There is a European Agreement supplementing the Convention on Road Traffic (1968), which was concluded in Geneva, on 1 May 1971. \n\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic was concluded at Vienna on 8 November 1968. Since its entry into force on 21 May 1977, in signatory countries (\"Contracting Parties\") it replaces previous road traffic conventions, notably the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, in accordance with Article 48 of the Convention. The convention has been ratified by 83 countries, but those who have not ratified the convention may still be parties to the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic. Ireland, Canada, the United States, Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, China and Malaysia are examples of non-signatory countries. \n\nShort-term tourists are not permitted to bring cars into China. All foreign-registered vehicles in China must display a Chinese vehicle registration plate. In Malaysia, foreign registered vehicles are required to adhere to Malaysian window tint limit regulations or will be denied entry into Malaysia.\n\nOne of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognize the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. The following requirements must be met when driving outside the country of registration:\n\nThe convention also addresses minimum mechanical and safety equipment needed to be on board and defines an identification mark (Annex 4) to identify the origin of the vehicle.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of the Convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic. This requirement is challenged by the development of technology for collision avoidance systems and autonomous driving.\n\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic is the newest of three conventions that governs International Driving Permits. The other two are the 1926 Paris International Convention relative to Motor Traffic and the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic. When a state is contracting to more than one convention, the newest one terminate and replace previous ones in relation between those states. \n\nThe main regulations about driving licences are in Annex 6 (domestic driving permit) and Annex 7 (International Driving Permit). The currently active version of those is in force in each contracting party since no later than 29 March 2011 (Article 43). According to the 1968 Vienna Convention, an IDP must have an expiration date of no more than three years from its issue date or until the expiration date of national driving permit, whichever is earlier, and it is valid for a period of one year upon the arrival in the foreign country. \n\nArticle 41 of the convention describes requirements for driving licences. Key of those are:\n\n\nPrior to 29 March 2011, annex 6 and annex 7 defined forms of driver's licences that are different from those defined after that date. Driving licences issued before 29 March 2011 that match older edition of the annexes are valid until their expiration dates (article 43).\n\nBefore 29 March 2011 the convention demanded contracting parties to recognise as valid for driving in their territories:\n\n\nThe broad objective of these international conventions and agreements, the depositary of which is the Secretary-General of the United Nations, is to facilitate international transport while providing for a high level of safety, security, and environmental protection in transport:\n\n\n\n"}

Under UK labour law, the police are prohibited from joining ordinary trade unions to defend pay and working conditions, by the Police Act 1996, because of the view that a police strike would pose an exceptional public safety risk. The PFEW was originally established by the Police Act 1919 as an alternative system, which would serve to represent staff, and where disputes could be resolved through arbitration so long as the government (as employer) continued to bargain in good faith.\n\nThere were approximately 124,000 members in 2014. Members can elect not to pay subscriptions and thereby not receive the legal representation and other benefits that paying members receive, but they still continue officially to be members of the Federation. In reality only a very few officers have ever decided not to pay their full subscription dues. Superintendents and Chief superintendents are represented by a separate staff association, the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales (PSA), while the most senior officers are members of the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA).\n\nThe Police Federation of England and Wales was set up by the Police Act 1919 after two British police strikes in 1918 and 1919. The government of the day were frightened by the prospect of the police going on strike and created the Police Federation of England and Wales and withdrew the right of officers in the UK to strike.\n\nPolice officers hold office and are not employees. Each officer is an independent legal official and not an \"agent of the police force, police authority or government\". This allows the police their unique status and notionally provides the citizens of the UK a protection from any government that might wish unlawfully to use the police as an instrument against them. Many observers mistakenly equate the Police Federation with a trade union. This is technically an incorrect assumption, as it was set up specifically by the government of the day not to be a trade union; however in reality the Federation does function in a similar manner. It negotiates with the Official Side on all matters concerning its membership's pay, allowances, hour of duty, annual leave, pensions and other conditions of service. However, unlike a union, the Federation is controlled entirely by serving police officers, has no political affiliations, and has no powers to call a strike. That is not to say that the Federation remains aloof from applying political pressure, as the successful 1976 ballot regarding the right to strike and the 2012/13 \"Plebgate\" affair.\n\nEach of the 43 police forces in England and Wales has its own federation branch board and council. The 43 forces are grouped into eight regions. Due to its size, the Metropolitan Police federation branch board is structured differently.\n\nAt the end of December 2012, the PFEW announced it would be independently reviewed. The review was conducted by Sir David Normington and the Police Federation accepted all 36 recommendations of the review in May 2014 and is currently working through making these organisational changes. \n\nAs such, an Interim National Board (INB) was set up (formerly the Joint Central Committee) which had responsibility for national pay negotiations on behalf of its members. This has now been superseded by the National Board. It also performs many other functions, such as training, administering legal representation and liaising with government and other national bodies on policy and legislative matters. The present National Board Chair is John Apter.\n\nThe PFEW's HQ is at Leatherhead, Surrey, in a complex which also incorporates the federation's national training centre and a hotel facility for federation members.\n\nChair and general secretary of Police Federation of England and Wales both retired after \"turbulent period\" on 7 April 2014. Steve Williams and Ian Rennie announced their plans to retire from the police service at the end of May. Steve White was elected as Chair and Andy Fittes elected as General Secretary at the Police Federation's Annual Conference in May 2014. \n\nAt the same conference (on 21 May 2014), the Home Secretary Theresa May announced that public funding of the Police Federation would end in August 2014.\n\nIn the police drama \"Line of Duty\", officers under investigation are often shown accompanied by a \"Fed rep\" during interviews.\n\n\n"}

Ross, Paul Postal, and later James McCawley. George Lakoff and Pieter Seuren were also instrumental in developing and advocating the theory.\n\nThe approach developed out of transformational generative grammar in the mid-1960s, but stood largely apart from, and in opposition to, work by Noam Chomsky and his later students. This move led to a more abstract framework and lately to the abandonment of the notion of the CFG formal grammar induced deep structure.\n\nA number of ideas from later work in generative semantics have been incorporated into cognitive linguistics, head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG), construction grammar, and into mainstream Chomskyan linguistics.\n\nThe controversy surrounding generative semantics stemmed in part from the competition between two fundamentally different approaches to semantics within transformational generative syntax. The first semantic theories designed to be compatible with transformational syntax were \"interpretive\". Syntactic rules enumerated a set of well-formed sentences paired with syntactic structures, each of which was assigned an \"interpretation\" by the rules of a separate semantic theory. This left syntax relatively (though by no means entirely) \"autonomous\" with respect to semantics, and was the approach preferred by Chomsky.\n\nIn contrast, generative semanticists argued that interpretations were generated directly by the grammar as deep structures, and were subsequently transformed into recognizable sentences by transformations. This approach necessitated more complex underlying structures than those proposed by Chomsky, and more complex transformations as a consequence. Despite this additional complexity, the approach was appealing in several respects. First, it offered a powerful mechanism for explaining synonymity. In his initial work in generative syntax, Chomsky motivated transformations using active/passive pairs such as \"I hit John\" and \"John was hit by me\", which despite their identical meanings have quite different surface forms. Generative semanticists wanted to account for \"all\" cases of synonymity in a similar fashion—an impressively ambitious goal before the advent of more sophisticated interpretive theories in the 1970s. Second, the theory had a pleasingly intuitive structure: the form of a sentence was quite literally \"derived\" from its meaning via transformations. To some, interpretive semantics seemed rather \"clunky\" and \"ad hoc\" in comparison. This was especially so before the development of trace theory.\n\n There is little agreement concerning the question of whose idea generative semantics was. All of the people mentioned here have been credited with its invention (often by each other). \n\n\n"}

By 2012, the museum experienced a profit of $300,000, its most successful year since 2007.\n\nIn June 2019, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was awarded the Gold American Award for Nonprofit Organization of the Year from the American Business Awards.\n\nThe museum chronologically charts the progress of the Negro leagues with informative placards and interactive exhibits. Its walls are lined with pictures of players, owners, and officials of Negro league baseball from the Negro National League of 1920 through the Negro American League which lasted until 1962. As visitors progress through the exhibit, they move forward in time through the history of Black baseball. In one area of the museum, there are lockers set up for some of the legends of the Negro leagues. One can see game-worn uniforms, cleats, gloves, and other artifacts from stars such as Josh Gibson, the \"Black Babe Ruth.\"\n\nAn impressive aspect of the museum is the Field of Legends. Separated from the visitor at the entrance by chicken wire, it is accessible only at the end of the tour. One can walk onto a field adorned by nearly life-sized bronze statues of twelve figures from Negro league history. Crouching behind the plate is Gibson, one of the most prolific hitters in baseball history, a man who allegedly hit over 80 home runs in one season. At first base is another Baseball Hall of Famer, Buck Leonard, a teammate of Gibson's with the Homestead Grays. At second base is Pop Lloyd, Judy Johnson monitors shortstop, while Ray Dandridge holds down third base. In the outfield are Cool Papa Bell, Oscar Charleston, and Leon Day. On the mound is perhaps the most famous Negro leaguer of all time, Satchel Paige, who became a rookie in the major leagues at age 42 in 1948. At the plate is Martín Dihigo, the only man to be inducted into the Halls of Fame in three countries: Mexico, Cuba, and the United States. Other statues commemorate Rube Foster, the founder of the first Negro National League, and Buck O'Neil, a former Kansas City Monarch and a member of the board of the museum until his October 6, 2006, death.\n\nOn November 13, 2012, the family of Buck O'Neil donated two items to the museum in honor of what would have been his 101st birthday. O'Neil's Presidential Medal of Freedom—awarded posthumously by President George W. Bush—was donated. Also given to the museum was a miniature replica of the Buck O' Neil statue which is displayed at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The items are showcased in a special area of the NLBM dedicated to O'Neil.\n\nOn June 5, 2008, Geddy Lee (of the Canadian band Rush), himself an avid baseball fan, donated nearly 200 autographed baseballs to the NLBM. The signatures on these baseballs include names such as Hank Aaron, Cool Papa Bell, and Lionel Hampton. At the time, Geddy Lee's gift was one of the largest single donations the NLBM had ever received.\n\nEach year, the museum presents the following awards:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301444", "title": "1994–95 NHL lockout", "text": "1994–95 NHL lockout\n\nThe 1994–95 NHL lockout was a lockout that came after a year of National Hockey League (NHL) hockey that was played without a collective bargaining agreement. The lockout was a subject of dispute as the players sought collective bargaining and owners sought to help franchises that had a weaker market as well as make sure they could cap the rising salaries of players. The lockout caused the 1994–95 season to be shortened to 48 games instead of 84, the shortest season in 53 years.\n\nMuch like the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the big issue was the implementation of a salary cap. The NHL owners were strongly in favor of the cap while the players were opposed to it. The NHL wanted to levy a luxury tax, a financial penalty that is assigned by the league, on salaries that were higher than the average. However, the NHL's Player Association viewed that as a variation on a salary cap and refused to accept it. This came right off the heels of the 1992 walkout by players, which interrupted the race for the Stanley Cup.\n\nThis 3 month, 1 week, and 3 day lockout stretched from October 1, 1994, to January 11, 1995. A total of 468 games were lost due to the lockout, along with the All-Star Game. Unlike the league's future lockouts, the players went to training camp as if to start the season. However, as these camps came to a close it was obvious that there was to be labor talks in the near future.\n\nAs previously noted, the NHL wanted to levy a luxury tax on salaries that were higher than the average and the NHLPA viewed that as a variation on a salary cap and refused to accept it. Unlike in the 1992 strike, it was the owners who wanted to make sure that they got the right deal and this was under a new commissioner Gary Bettman. There were a few issues that the owners wanted to work out, most of which revolved around salary caps, free agency and hoping to limit escalating salaries. Bettman's \"NHL mandate was: aggressive expansion, a new American TV deal, a focus on growth (especially in the southern U.S.), and lasting labor peace … under the owners' terms, of course.\". It was widely assumed that to reach this peace a salary cap would have to be in place. Bettman's insisted the owners' plan was merely a tax plan, but would result the same as a salary cap.\n\nUnder the leadership of Bob Goodenow, the players decided that they would be open to a small tax, however the bulk of the financial goals could be achieved through revenue sharing. Going into the negotiations both the players and the owners agreed on one big issue, the small market franchises. The league wanted to tie salaries to revenue in order to subsidize the operation of weaker teams while the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) sought revenue sharing to help the smaller market teams.\n\nThe lockout attracted the attention of worldwide negotiation experts. An op-ed article in \"The New York Times\" by James K. Sebenius and his colleague Prof. Michael A. Wheeler brought to prominence a suggestion from fellow professors Howard Raiffa and David Lax: Revenue should flow into a separate escrow account touched by neither players nor owners until the dispute was resolved. This suggestion was not adopted.\n\nAfter the lockout had dragged on, the talk of salary cap faded and new items entered the debate. Talk of rookie salary cap, changes to the arbitration system, and loosened free agency. However, large market teams such as Toronto, Detroit, the New York Rangers, Dallas, and Philadelphia eventually broke with the league, as they feared that an extended lockout would outweigh the benefits from getting a salary cap and didn't want to be the first league in North America to forfeit an entire season just to help out their small-market colleagues.\n\nWhile some NHL players decided to play in various European leagues, others decided to remain in North America. Around that time, the \"4-on-4 Challenge\" (i.e. four players and a goalie on the ice) was initiated. This NHLPA organized tournament was played over the course of three days from the 10th to the 12th of November 1994 during the owners' lockout of 1994–95; all the games were played in Hamilton, Ontario's Copps Coliseum. In the end, Team Ontario defeated Team USA, Team Western Canada and Team Quebec to win the tournament, which raised more than half a million dollars to support the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities of Canada and minor hockey associations throughout North America. Many NHL superstars, notably Patrick Roy, Luc Robitaille, Brett Hull, Joe Sakic, Doug Gilmour, Rob Blake and Mike Richter, took part in this competition.\n\nAlso in the meantime, Wayne Gretzky and some friends formed the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour and played some exhibition games in various countries.\n\nThe lockout ended on January 11, 1995. As a result, the league shortened the season length from 84 games, the length of the previous two seasons, to 48. Furthermore, the season would last from January 20 to May 3; this was the first and only time in NHL history that the regular season extended into May. Regular-season games would be limited to intra-conference play (Eastern Conference teams did not play Western Conference teams). During the lockout, the NHL and NHLPA agreed to shorten future seasons to 82 games. San Jose, which was to host the All-Star game that year, was awarded the 1997 game instead.\n\nThe lockout would eventually lead to two Canadian teams moving to the United States—the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver in the summer of 1995 and became the Colorado Avalanche, and the original Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix and became the Phoenix Coyotes in the summer of 1996. The Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The Avalanche and Hurricanes would win the Stanley Cup within the next decade.\n\nEventually there was another lockout in 2004–05, which resulted in that season being canceled altogether. On September 16, 2012 another lockout started, but it ended on January 6, 2013. The 1994–1995 lockout had created resentment between the players and owners. When the next lockout happened in 2004 the owners attempted to come down hard on the players. In the end a salary cap for rookies was instituted, and all players signing rookie contract needed to sign two-way contracts which allowed teams to send them down to minor league teams at minor league-level pay rather than the pay rate they received while playing for the parent NHL club. The league had expanded by four teams and began to participate in the Olympics. The league was to extend the CBA twice to ensure labor peace during that time. However salaries continue to rise, eventually hitting an average of $1.8 million and this was key in setting up the issues in the 2004–2005 lockout.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301451", "title": "Pete Sanstol", "text": "Pete Sanstol\n\nPete Sanstol (March 28, 1905 – March 13, 1982) was a Norwegian professional boxer who took the Canadian version of the World Bantamweight Championship in Montreal in 1931 against Archie Bell. He contended twice unsuccessfully for the NBA World Bantamweight Title, and was a class of 2000 World Boxing Hall of Fame inductee.\n\nLew Burston, Raoul Godbout, George Blake, and Bobby Diamond were his managers. His trainers were Jake Kravitz and Manny Seeman.\n\nPeder Olai Sanstøl was the youngest of five children born to Jonas Jonasen Sanstøl (1864–1942) and Elen Dortea Nilsdatter Lindland (1860–1946) in Moi, Lunde municipality, in Rogaland county in Norway. He moved to Stavanger with his parents as a child. Sanstol learned to box in the club Kristiana AK, after his family moved to Oslo. Boxing as an amateur, he came in fourth in the flyweight class championship in 1923 and won gold in the bantam class championship in 1925.\n\nPete Sanstol embarked on a professional career in 1926. After winning his professional debut against the British boxing veteran Bert Gallard in Oslo, Sanstol was invited by Max Schmeling's manager to train in Berlin. After Sanstol left Norway in the mid-1920s, he only occasionally returned.\n\nOn July 13, 1926 Sanstol defeated Harry Stein, than the Flyweight Champion of Germany, in Berlin at Luna Park in a four-round newspaper decision. The source, BOX-SPORT reported that Sanstol won the decision decisively.\n\nWinning all his bouts in Germany, Sanstol moved on to Paris where he fought at least through February 1927. On January 24, 1927, he met the well known Andre Dedieu at the Central Sporting Club in Paris, winning in a third-round technical knockout. Some observers in Paris compared him to French boxing champion, Georges Carpentier. Discovered in Paris by American manager Lew Burston (1896–1969), Sanstol was brought to New York around mid-1927, where he graduated from the club preliminaries to become the most sought after bantam in the eastern United States and Canada.\n\nOn October 22, 1930, Sanstol fought a tough ten-round draw against Joey Scalfano at Madison Square Garden that was \"nip and tuck for the entire ten rounds\", and a great crowd pleaser. Sanstol later described it as one of his toughest fights. There were no knockdowns in the bout and the fighting was fast-paced and frenzied. Scalfaro's left eye was completed closed for the last two rounds and his blows often missed their mark. Sanstol had previously lost to Scalfaro on August 6, 1930 at Madison Square Garden in a ten-round points decision. Scalfaro was known as the only boxer to score a knock down of the Black Cuban champion Kid Chocolate in North America.\n\nBy late 1930, Sanstol had moved his headquarters from the Norwegian-American community of Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn, NY, to Montreal, Canada where he came under the management of Raoul Godbout (1894–1975).\n\nOn May 20, 1931, in his most important bout, Sanstol won the World Bantamweight Title in a ten-round unanimous decision against the great New York Jewish contender Archie Bell in Montreal. The title was recognized by the Montreal Athletic Commission and the Canadian Boxing Federation, so it had some limits in its scope. The fast bout had no knockdowns. For a championship bout, it received very limited coverage in American newspapers. Sanstol weighted 115 1/2, giving up only two pounds to Bell. Bell would later contend for but not take the British version of the World Bantamweight Title and contend twice for the California version of the World Featherweight Title.\n\nSanstol twice successfully defended his bantamweight title. On June 17, 1931, Sanstol defeated Art Giroux, also of Montreal, in the Canadian version of a World Bantamweight Title. Leading in the betting odds by 7 to 5, Sanstol won the fifteen round bout at the Forum in Montreal in a fifteen-round Unanimous Decision. Giroux was the Canadian Bantamweight Champion at the time. After the win, Sanstol was rated second in the world in the bantamweight division, behind only Panama Al Brown, according to the quarterly standings of the National Boxing Association (NBA).\n\nOn July 29, 1931, again at the Forum in Montreal, Sanstol defeated Eugène Huat in a ten-round Unanimous Decision in his second defense of the Canadian version of the World Bantamweight Title. Huat was the French Bantamweight Champion at the time. In a fairly close bout, Huat knocked Sanstol off his feet in the eighth round. In the eighth round, Huat scored often with lightning fast jabs that went through Sanstol's defense, though Huat appeared to have lost the first few rounds, with Sanstol not clearly taking the lead til the seventh. In the ninth the boxing seemed close, but in the tenth, perhaps with greater stamina, Sanstol took the offensive and battered Huat with telling blows. Sanstol's performance in the final round may have strongly influenced the judge's decisions. The final decision for Sanstol was not entirely popular with the crowd.\n\nOn August 25, 1931, Sanstol met Panama Al Brown for the widely recognized NBA and NYSAC World Bantamweight Title before a crowd of 23,000 at the Forum in Montreal. The bout was considered the largest gross take on a bout in the history of boxing in Montreal according to the \"New York Times\", and was easily one of the largest audiences for any of Sanstol's fights. Sanstol lost the bout in a close fifteen round split decision. In the close bout, the Canadian Press gave Brown seven rounds, Stanstol five, with three rounds even.\n\nSanstol fought much of the bout in a crouch, to compensate for a six-inch disadvantage in height and reach. Aiming down on Sanstol, Brown scored frequently with blows to the head, opening a cut over one of Sanstol's eyes, which eventually reduced his vision. Sanstol fought on doggedly despite his. Fighting during the depression, Sanstol took about $3,427 for his loss, not a great amount for a world championship bout, considering Jack Dempsey had received over $150,000 for some of his World Heavyweight Championship wins.\n\nOn July 20, 1932 Sanstol fought a ten-round draw with 1929 NBA World Flyweight Champion Emille \"Spider\" Pladner, a French born boxer, at the Forum in Montreal, Canada. An important bout between contenders, the January 1932 ratings, listed Sanstol as the third best bantamweight in the world, with Pladner listed as fourth. Pladner had also held the 1931 Canadian World Bantamweight Title.\n\nAfter losing the bout with Brown, Sanstol took a year off between August 1931 and June 1932, before resuming another campaign for the championship. On August 15, 1933, Sanstol fought an important bout against Midget Wolgast, NYSAC World Flyweight Champion at the time, losing in a ten-round non-title points decision in a bout where the brows of his face and his eyes were battered. According to one source, Wolgast won every round.\n\nOn September 1, 1934, Sanstol defeated World Champion Victor \"Young\" Perez at Bislet Stadium in Oslo in a ten-round points decision. In October 1931, Perez had taken the NBA World Flyweight Championship in a second-round knockout at the Palais de Sports in Paris, France, making him one of the youngest world boxing champions in history. In 1929, Perez had also taken the French Flyweight Title. A Tunisian Jew, Perez would die tragically in 1945 on a march from Auschwitz, where he had been interned, after being denounced to the Nazis in Paris in 1943.\n\nHe retired from boxing in late 1933, fighting only one bout in 1934, and then resumed his boxing in Sweden in 1935. He won a ten-round points decision in Berlin against Hans Schiller, former German Featherweight Champion, on May 10, 1935. In Sweden he met Werner Reithdorf on April 26, 1935, winning in an eighth-round TKO in Gothenburg, and Joey Carr on March 1, 1935, also in Gothenburg, where he won in a first-round knockout.\n\nWith both boxers very near 118, Sanstol had his last NBA World Bantamweight Championship match with Sixto Escobar, on August 7, 1935 at the Forum in Montreal. Sanstol lost the bout in a twelve-round unanimous decision, that was not particularly close, though quite satisfying to the crowd. In the seventh, Escobar closed Sanstol's left eye, in effect winning the bout, or reducing his need to show the same level of aggression. Ringside observers gave Escobar eight rounds, with four rounds even.\n\nSanstol had one more career bout of consequence, on September 13, 1935, defeating Al Brown in Oslo in a ten-round non-title decision a month after the Escobar fight, not long before his retirement.\n\nSanstol joined the US Army Air Corp on April 3, 1942. He served a total of three years and two months. During his service, he fought two army benefit fights on May 1, and July 16, 1942 in Miami, Florida, winning both in a four-round and then ten-round decision. While in the Air Corp, he also refereed a bout on May 8, 1943 in Montreal.\n\nHe completed his service on June 12, 1945. He became a U.S. citizen, a privilege he had long awaited, in 1943 during his service with the Army.\n\nSanstol was known for his aggression, energy, speed, amazing stamina and uncanny defense. He was also known for his ability to give the crowd a thrilling show. About the only attribute he lacked was the so-called \"power punch\", although a quarter of his 98 victories were by way of knockout. Throughout his early career, Sanstol used these skills to build an impressive record. In time, his fighting style gradually evolved from that of a careless youth, to that of a wizened veteran. After his first bout with Panama Al Brown, Sanstol learned to pace himself better and to use every punch sparingly, not wasting a single drop of energy. Part of this evolution may have resulted from a chronically bad foot or ankle he first sustained during one of these title bouts. It would haunt and hobble him for the remainder of his professional career.\n\nLong-time \"Montreal Herald\" Sports Editor Elmer W. Ferguson (1885–1972) once described Sanstol's evolved fighting style as follows:\n\n\nAfter his boxing career ended, Sanstol worked various jobs in Norway, New York City, Chicago, Seattle, and Alaska, including restaurant owner, newspaper writer, recreation center director, hotel clerk, and translator. In 1957, he completed his autobiography entitled \"Gjennom Ringen\".\n\nHe married Bessie Andrews Marshal in Seattle on August 24, 1956. Shortly after the wedding, Sanstol and his wife moved to live in Norway, where he was still remembered for his boxing. He was in demand, often telling stories of his boxing days, and speaking to groups. In 1960, Pete moved back to the West Coast of the United States with his wife, taking a job in Long Beach, California, as a translator for a shipping company. In 1962, Sanstol and his wife moved to nearby San Pedro. By October 15, 1981, Sanstol was living in a Convalescent Home in Torrance, California suffering from a diagnosed form of dementia.\n\nHe died in 1982 in Whittier, California after a series of strokes. On June 7, 2005, Lund municipality raised a monolith in a park in Moi to his memory, listing him as Norway's most famous boxer.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301456", "title": "South West Africa Territorial Force", "text": "South West Africa Territorial Force\n\nThe South West Africa Territorial Force (SWATF) was an auxiliary arm of the South African Defence Force (SADF) and comprised the armed forces of South West Africa (now Namibia) from 1977 to 1989. It emerged as a product of South Africa's political control of the territory which was granted to the former as a League of Nations mandate following World War I.\n\nFrom 1966 until 1989, South African security forces waged a long and bitter counterinsurgency conflict against indigenous nationalists in what was then South West Africa, represented by the Marxist South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) and its military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). As the guerrilla war intensified, however, it became clear that the local civilian police alone were not enough to cope with SWAPO/PLAN incursions and escalating unrest. Consequently, military units were deployed for the first time; 60,000 South African combat troops were engaged in South West Africa by the late 1970s.\n\nAs part of a general policy of military and social reform, Pretoria initiated the establishment of local defence and police agencies for its protectorate beginning in 1977.\n\nA start was also made with the regrouping of existing units into four formations: \n\nAs regarding the latter, the South African Air Force would remain responsible for aerial operations although provision was made for an air commando squadron consisting of private and commercially qualified air crews. Their main function was to assist the South African Air Force in reconnaissance and communication flights and to provide operational officers for the operational service.\n\nThe new South West African Territorial Force was officially created on 1 August 1980, from South West African citizens already serving with the South African Defence Force.\n\nOperationally, the SWATF was further divided into a Permanent Force infantry component, logistic/administrative divisions, a training wing, and a Citizen Force, which included at least three motorised infantry battalions. The 'permanent force' comprised mostly volunteer auxiliaries and national servicemen, who formed eight battalions. A militia system was also developed for local security, including over twenty 'area protection units'.\n\nBy 1981, SWATF's total strength numbered some 10,100 men, organised into both tribal-based battalions (including separate units for Ovambo, Herero, and Coloured ethnic groups) and multiethnic units partially manned by at least 10,000 white South West African personnel.\n\nBy 1987, SWATF had an estimated 22,000 troops, including additional units of engineers, signals personnel, mounted troops, a parachute battalion, and a commando squadron.\n\nA school cadet program similar to that in South Africa was developed for South West Africa.\nPrimarily all SWATF members received their initial training at 2 SA Infantry Battalion at Walvis Bay, (considered South African territory at that stage).\n\nAdvanced training, NCOs and Officer development however occurred at the SWA Military School at Okhandja.\n\nFor all practical purposes, SWATF remained firmly integrated into existing SADF command structures. Its primary goal was protection of the territory of SWA from SWAPO incursions. The SWATF was placed under the control of the Department of Defence for South West Africa and was always headed by a SADF general. There was also a joint SWATF/SADF committee established for \"planning, liaison, and coordination\" efforts.\n\nThe first major step in the establishment of an independent territorial defence force in SWA was the introduction of a new nutria uniform on 6 September 1979 through which SWA units could be distinguished from SADF units.\n\nThe rank structure of the SWATF was identical to that of the SADF. The insignia however differed considerably.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough SWATF relied heavily on South Africa's special forces, over time it developed its own capability.\n\nBy 1979, South West Africa was subdivided into Operational Sectors. Three Frontline Sectors, 10, 20 and 70 fell under direct control of the South Africa Defence Force's South West Africa Command. Four additional Sectors, 30, 40, 50 and 60 covered the rest of South West Africa and was commanded directly by SWATF officers from 1980.\n\nFrontline Sectors were used for the massing of forces in preparation for external operations into Angola, acting as a buffer with the rest of the territory and reaction to immediate threats. \n\nAlthough theoretically under control of the Area Force, due to their proximity to Angola the vast majority of conventional forces was based in these areas and remained under the direct control of South West Africa Command, a SADF regional command.\n\n(Kaokoland and Owambo) - HQ Oshakati\n\n\n\n\n(Kavango and Western Caprivi) - HQ Rundu\n\n\nThese frontline Sectors also had immediate reaction forces (Special Service Companies) to deal with any attack and were primarily infantry company strength and fully motorised.\n\n\n\n(Eastern Caprivi) - HQ Mpacha\nEncompassed the Eastern Caprivi covering the Zambian border from Cuado to the Zambezi River.\n\n\nApart from the Frontline Sectors, four additional Sectors existed. 26 Area Force Units, similar to the South African commando system, was established for these less vulnerable parts of the territory.\n\nHQ Otjiwarongo (Citadel).\n\n\nSWATF Otjiwarongo AME (Area Force Unit - \"Area Mag Eenheid\"), Outjo AME, Grootfontein AME, Tsumeb AME, Herreroland AME, Ethosa AME, Otavi AME, Damaraland AME and UIS PL. Its area of responsibility was likewise the Grootfontein, Tsumeb, Otavi, Outjo, Otjiwarongo, Hereroland and Damaraland regions.\n\n\nHQ Windhoek.\n\nSWATF Alte Feste AME, Khomas AME, Hochl AME, Okahandja AME, Omaruru AME, Swakopmund AME, Rehoboth AME, Katatura AME and Khomasdal AME.\n\nOther Units in this Sector:\n\n\n\nHQ Gobabis.\n\nSWATF Aranos AME, Auob AME, Bo-Nossob AME, Aminius PL, Gobabis AME, Rietfont AME, Mariental AME and Maltahohe AME.\n\nHQ Keetmanshoop.\n\nSWATF Karasburg AME, Keetmanshop AME, Hoop AME, Bethanien AME, Oranjemund AME, Luderitz AME and Namaland AME.\n\nWhile the SWATF relied heavily on the South African Air Force for combat and heavy logistics transportation, it did have its own Air Wing, which consisted mainly of civilian aircraft.\n\n1 SWA Commando Squadron was established as 112 Air Commando on 24 September 1963 in Windhoek. The unit was staffed by volunteer civilian aircraft. From 1968, control of 112 Commando squadron passed from the SA Army to the SAAF and it was transferred to Light Aircraft Command. \nIn 1970, it was disbanded, but in 1980 it was re-established as part of the SWATF.\n\n\n\nA lot of effort was used to interdict insurgent groups that had crossed over the Angolan border. These Insurgents were on foot, but knew the land and moved fast. There have been stories of the insurgents moving incredible distances with little supplies, whilst being chased and if cornered putting up a good resistance to their followers. Adrenaline injections were found at some of the incident scenes after a fire fight.\n\nThese insurgents were normally stalked by using trained trackers, who directed the reaction force.

As a youngster, he wanted to become a priest and was educated in a monastery. He changed his mind, however, and left Languedoc to become a mercenary in the service of Denmark. De la Gardie was promoted to officer and was in charge of a regiment of mercenaries. In 1565, during the Northern Seven Years' War, he was captured by Swedish troops at Varberg and changed allegiance to Sweden. De la Gardie quickly became a favourite of John III of Sweden and in 1569, after only four years in the Swedish service, he received nobility status. In 1571, he was created a baron and was given Ekholmen Castle.\n\nHe was suspected to have taken part in a plot to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay. John III was to be killed during a sword dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic. After the assassination, the king's brother Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. The plot did not materialize as de Mornay lost his nerve and never gave the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot. However, it is noted that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Banér and Pontus De la Gardie often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth of Sweden, meetings where Princess Cecilia of Sweden had also frequently been seen, and the two sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised though they were never accused. Pontus De la Gardie was himself never put on trial for his suspected involvement in the affair.\n\nAfter Clas Åkesson Tott's resignation as the supreme commander of the Swedish forces in Finland and Estonia as a consequence of the Siege of Wesenberg (1574) during the Livonian War, de la Gardie took over Tott's office. De la Gardie's skills, combined with the fact that Sweden's enemy Russia had to transfer troops to defend against Polish attacks further south, led to considerable military success for Sweden during the following years. In the fall of 1580, Karelia was conquered. De la Gardie led his troops over the frozen Gulf of Finland to capture the fortresses of Wesenberg (now Rakvere) and Tolsburg (now Toolse). In September 1581, Narva was taken after a storming that had been preceded by a massive bombardment. 4,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, pointing out the fact that De la Gardie was not only a skillful warrior, but a cruel and hard commander as well. De la Gardie and his Swedish troops went on to capture the fortress of Ivangorod and several other fortresses that autumn. In 1582, the war with Russia ended and Sweden got to keep the conquests made in Karelia and Ingria, but had to withdraw from Livonia.\n\nDe la Gardie was the most renowned military commander in Sweden during the 16th century and has been credited with much of the country's military success in the 1580s. An example of his ingenuity was the strategy of using zigzag shaped saps during the siege of Narva, a new technique at the time.\n\nDe la Gardie drowned in the Narva River and is buried in St Mary's Cathedral of Tallinn. His tomb chest is made by well-known artist and architect Arent Passer.\n\nOn 4 February 1580 De la Gardie married Sofia Johansdotter Gyllenhielm (ca.1556-1583), the illegitimate daughter of John III of Sweden and a Finnish lady, Karin Hansdotter. During the wedding, a gallery in the church collapsed and one person was killed. Some sceptics claimed it was a bad omen or a divine act with which God condemned the marriage.\n\nPontus De la Gardie and Sofia Gyllenhielm had three children:\n"}

Their sound was an array of mixed influences, including progressive rock, AOR and pop reminiscent of both the Beatles and the Beach Boys.\n\nToy Matinee was formed by producer/composer/keyboardist Patrick Leonard in collaboration with singer/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist Kevin Gilbert. Backed by a group of session musicians (drummer Brian MacLeod, guitarist Tim Pierce, and bassist Guy Pratt), and with guest appearances from several other musicians including Julian Lennon, the duo recorded just one self-titled album which was released on Reprise Records in 1990.\n\nThe album was engineered and produced by Bill Bottrell. Thematically, it covered a rather broad ground. Two tracks were dedicated to Czech poet and political figure Václav Havel and painter Salvador Dalí, while \"Queen of Misery\" is about Madonna. Leonard was the singer's longtime songwriting and producing partner, and in addition to him most members of Toy Matinee worked on Madonna's \"I'm Breathless\" album—Gilbert as an engineer, Bottrell as producer and engineer, Pratt on bass, and Pierce on guitar.\n\nAfter the album was released, session musicians Pratt, MacLeod and Pierce moved on to other work, and Leonard wasn't interested in a tour that involved replacing all of them. Gilbert took on that role himself instead, assembling a promotional band for the album which featured Gilbert's then girlfriend, Sheryl Crow, on keyboards, Marc Bonilla on guitar. Spencer Campbell on bass. Toss Panos on drums. There were a number of short tours.\n\nA 1991 live recording of Gilbert and this touring band performing songs from the album was released in 2010 as \"Kevin Gilbert Performs Toy Matinee Live at the Roxy\" The group engaged in heavy radio promotion wherever possible, most notably frequent appearances on the Mark & Brian show on Los Angeles-area station KLOS. Some of those sessions were released on Mark & Brian's KLOS compilation recordings, such as a stripped down version of \"The Ballad Of Jenny Ledge\" on their \"You Had to Be There\" collection.\n\nTwo of the songs on \"Toy Matinee\" -- \"The Ballad of Jenny Ledge\" and \"Last Plane Out\"—received wide play on AOR stations partly due to Gilbert's promotional work, both of them peaking at No. 23 on \"Billboard's\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Despite the chart success of the singles, the album's highest U.S. chart position was No. 129, and sales were below expectations enough that many unsold copies of the CD were widely available as cut-outs in the early '90s.\n\nGilbert went on to do additional work with Bottrell including Sheryl Crow's debut album and solo projects. In 1994, Leonard and former Mr. Mister frontman Richard Page released the album \"Meanwhile\" as Third Matinee. Gilbert's untimely death in 1996 ended any possibility of a second Toy Matinee album.\n\n\nIn 1999 the album was remixed into surround by DTS Entertainment, released as a DTS encoded 5.1 compact disc with a slightly altered version of first track \"Last Plane Out\". A second DTS version was released in 2001 as a DVD-Audio title, using Meridian Lossless Packing and a 2.0 channel stereo version of the album encoded in Dolby Digital. The 2001 stereo remaster and the 2.0 Dolby Digital version on the DVD-Audio release all include the alternate \"Last Plane Out\".

He first appeared in \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #148 (August 1981), by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum. He is a Mutant who has the ability to sense other mutants, he was originally a member of the Morlocks. He was also a member of the X-Factor, X-Men, X-Force and . He was chosen twice by Apocalypse as one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, first as Death and the second time as Pestilence, and Apocalypse also enhanced his superpowers through genetic manipulation.\n\nThe character was portrayed in film by Tómas Lemarquis in \"\" (2016) and his older version by Stephen Merchant in \"Logan\" (2017).\n\nCaliban's first appearance was in \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #148 (August 1981), written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Dave Cockrum.\n\nHe is born an albino mutant with a pale complexion and large yellow eyes. At some point in his life, he is banished from his home by his father, who called him Caliban, after a character from the play \"The Tempest\" by William Shakespeare.\n\nGrowing up, a still young Caliban, who speaks in the third person, is discovered by the mutant Callisto and taken under her wing. Learning of his mutant tracking ability, Callisto uses Caliban to locate other disenfranchised mutants and organizes them into the Morlocks, a band of homeless, rejected mutants. The founding Morlocks consist of Caliban, Callisto, Masque, Plague, and Sunder. The Morlocks live in the sewers and abandoned subway tunnels running underneath New York City, and, like Caliban, most of them had grotesque appearances.\n\nCaliban senses the presence of nearby mutants and enters a New York City nightclub seeking their friendship. He finds Storm, Dazzler, Kitty Pryde, and the original Spider-Woman in the club, and has a misunderstood confrontation with them. Though the battle ends peacefully, Caliban returns to his home underground.\n\nShortly thereafter, Morlock leader Callisto desires a consort and has the Morlocks abduct Warren Worthington, the Angel and a member of the X-Men, to be her husband. The X-Men arrive in the sewers to rescue their ally, and Kitty is infected with a virus by Plague. Caliban takes her to his quarters to care for her. Kitty pleads with Caliban to allow her to assist her teammates. Caliban agrees, but only if she will return after the fight and stay with him. Though Kitty promised to stay with him forever, she left and returned home. Weeks later, Callisto, vengeful after losing a one-on-one battle with X-Men leader Storm, orders the Morlocks to kidnap Kitty to force her to marry Caliban, knowing Storm would return. Caliban, however, realized Kitty did not truly love him and released her from her promise. Kitty then became Caliban's friend.\n\nCaliban was later temporarily magically merged with Professor X by Kulan Gath during a confrontation with the sorcerer.\n\nDuring the Morlock massacre, X-Factor rescued Caliban from the Marauders, and Caliban swore vengeance upon the Marauders. With nowhere else to stay, he took up residence at X-Factor headquarters with several other surviving Morlocks. Soon, he forced Masque to undo damage to the Beast's face, and then returned to the Alley. However, shortly thereafter, Rictor went missing and Caliban volunteered to help X-Factor find him, officially joining the group at that point. Alongside X-Factor, he next battled the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Caliban voiced his wish for increased power, so Iceman began teaching Caliban unarmed combat. He next fought the Right's soldiers and was nearly killed by them; then he aided X-Factor in rescuing the Right's mutant captives.\n\nNot long after that, X-Factor's immortal enemy Apocalypse kidnaps the entire team after changing Angel into Death. Caliban, intrigued by Apocalypse's transformation of the fallen Angel, betrays X-Factor and asks Apocalypse to do the same to him. Agreeing, Apocalypse promises to give Caliban enough power to gain revenge against the Marauders who killed his Morlock family. Caliban agrees to become Apocalypse's servant and locator of mutants. Apocalypse renames him Hellhound. Caliban senses the telepathic cry of Val-Or. Through genetic manipulation, Caliban becomes the second Horseman of Apocalypse known as Death.\n\nWhen Apocalypse had re-located to the moon in a confrontation with the original X-Factor and the Inhumans, Caliban returns to the Morlock tunnels. There, he locates Sabretooth, a ferocious mutant and member of the Marauders, who is stalking the sewers to find and kill more Morlocks. In combat, Caliban breaks Sabretooth's back and leaves him for dead, not realizing that he has a healing factor. Caliban then attacks and defeats Archangel. He later finds and defeats Sabretooth again.\n\nAs Death, Caliban performs various tasks for his new master, serving as his warrior servant. During the X-Cutioner's Song, Caliban attacks former X-Factor members (and current X-Men) Jean Grey and Cyclops, under Apocalypse's (actually Mister Sinister posing as Apocalypse) orders. Alongside War and Famine, Caliban kidnaps Cyclops and Jean Grey so Apocalypse can give the pair to the mad telepath Stryfe, who believes the couple to be his parents. Famine, War, and Death then battle the X-Men and are defeated by them.\n\nEventually, the loner Caliban defeats Apocalypse's control at the cost of his mental faculties. At one point, when Sabretooth is a reluctant X-Men member, the mutant detector kidnaps X-Man Jubilee in exchange for the savage mutant, but he flees when Sabretooth mauls his face.\n\nThough mentally unwell, he retains enormous physical power and is befriended by the mutant Cable. Oddly, Caliban's color shifts from white and monstrous to a semi-friendly Ogre-like form that is purple in coloration. Cable invites Caliban to join his team X-Force. Caliban has many adventures with the team, such as confronting Mojo and his forces, and when Apocalypse's enemy Mister Sinister infiltrates the X-Mansion, Apocalypse's mental leash causes him to savagely maul Sinister. He also has several confrontations with Sabretooth during this time.\n\nAfter some time, Apocalypse returns and takes Caliban away from X-Force. This time, Apocalypse makes him his new Horseman Pestilence (coincidentally, the former Pestilence was Caliban's Morlock ally Plague). This time, Apocalypse augments Caliban's physical power even more and gives him the ability to spread telepathic disease as well. This time, Apocalypse's horsemen include Ahab, Deathbird, and Wolverine. After Apocalypse is merged with Cyclops, Caliban tracks down the merged being, and is freed from his service shortly before Cable destroys Apocalypse's spirit.\n\nReleased from his servitude to Apocalypse, Caliban once more reverts to his childlike state although he retains the monstrous physique he attained through Apocalypse's machinations. Subsequently, Caliban is captured by an anti-mutant medical research facility called the Watchtower. The Watchtower wishes to use Caliban for their own purposes but he is freed by X-Force. Caliban has devolved into a feral mental state where he only grunts and snarls but he manages to help X-Force against a menace called the Skornn.\n\nAfter M-Day, Caliban turned up at the Xavier institute as a member of . He is seen carrying the 198 banner, created by Erg, during the confrontation with O*N*E* over the \"tracking chips\" and again during Mr. M's exodus from the institute. He later helps the 198 escape with Domino and Shatterstar to one of Nick Fury's secret bases in the Nevada desert. Caliban was able to sense the stockpile of weapons in the base, but they were activated and locked down by Johnny Dee, a mutant who had puppet-like control over a fraction of the team. The original X-Men team went to collect the 198 but Bishop's pro-registration team stopped them. After a short battle, the two sides teamed up and, thanks to a joint effort by Cyclops and Bishop, were able to free the 198.\n\nCaliban later aids the Uncanny X-Men team after he is seriously injured by Masque, and crawls his way back to the Xavier Institute. Caliban enters the Morlock Tunnels with Warpath, Storm, and Hepzibah and find what Masque was talking about.\n\nCaliban becomes part of a strike-force, who are in search of the first newborn mutant since Decimation, along with Wolverine, Wolfsbane, X-23, Warpath, and Hepzibah (all of whom, except Hepzibah, form the new incarnation of X-Force). During a battle with Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers, Caliban sacrifices himself to save Warpath by jumping into the path of a line of bullets meant for him. His death distracts Warpath making Wolverine the only X-Force member to chase down Cable.\n\nDuring the \"Necrosha\" storyline, Caliban is revived through the Technarch transmode virus by Eli Bard and presented to Selene for the purpose of finding other dead mutants and resurrecting them by the same means, so Bard can sacrifice them and their powers to her. Caliban is later seen next to the grave of long time deceased New Mutants member Cypher and began reviving him. Through him Selene resurrected many deceased mutants, and as she faced X-Force, she digested their powerful life-force energies that would help extend her life.\n\nCaliban was one amongst many of the fallen mutants revived by The Five on the homeland of Homo Superior called Krakoa, he was shortly gunned down by assailants whom invaded Krakoa. \nCaliban is a mutant with the ability to psionically sense other mutants out to several miles away and track their movements. He also has the uncontrolled ability to psionically sense, absorb, and turn the psionic energy of fear radiated by humans against them, inducing more intense fear within their minds. He could also utilize fear from others to boost his strength to a level sufficient to easily overpower the original Spider Woman (Jessica Drew).\n\nHe is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by Iceman and later Apocalypse.\n\nAs Death, he attained superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, endurance, claws and fangs as well as imperviousness to physical injury through Apocalypse's genetic manipulation. He also has great skill at climbing and possesses superhuman leaping ability. He was also mentally conditioned to attack Apocalypse's former ally Mister Sinister on sight. His fear siphoning abilities had also been augmented and he can now control them as well as cast his power over a much wider net; not only gaining in strength from siphoning the anxiety of others but could harness strengthen and redistribute it in much stronger quantities by force of will. This facet of his bolstered power was dubbed the Shadow of Fear by Caliban himself.\n\nAs Pestilence, Apocalypse gave him the ability to generate a mental plague, a virus that attacks from within on the highest planes of the psyche and breaks down the mental functions of the target.\n\nBeing reverted to his original form by Masque, Caliban still appears to retain some superhuman strength affected by his adrenaline, as he was shown lifting rubble off of Skids that proved difficult for even Warpath to hoist.\n\nAfter being reanimated through the Technarch transmode virus, his ability changed to psionically sense not living mutants but dead mutants.\n\nOnce resurrected after the rise of the new mutant homeland, he resumed his muscular physical appearance he had when he was a horsemen of Apocalypse and before Masque warped his excess flesh away.\n\nIn the Age of Apocalypse reality, Caliban was a henchman of the bounty hunter Domino, using his powers to track down Nate Grey.

The firm opened a New York branch in 1885. Allard's Paris origin reinforced the firm's credibility in composing \"high style\" French interiors for the American elite, at times employing authentic \"boiseries\", mirrors and chimneypieces, skillfully extended and adapted for results that were comprehensive, acceptably correct from an academic point of view and socially conservative. Architectural fittings and sculpture were provided from the firm's ateliers, as well as furniture and upholstery, carpets, curtains and hangings.\n\nAllard, who employed, retained and collaborated with architects, had an arrangement with the designer Eugène Prignot, with whom he formed a partnership for the New York branch of his business. Prignot also provided designs for the London furniture makers Jackson and Graham; his prize-winning designs for elaborate draperies and curtains were exhibited at World's Fairs and published in engravings. Allard's Paris showrooms were in rue de Châteaudun. According to the 1895 London street directory the company, 'Jules Allard & Sons, Decorators' also had a branch in the heart of London's architectural quarter at No.9 Buckingham Street, Adelphi, just off the Strand.\n\nThe French salon supplied by Allard at the William K. Vanderbilt House at 660 Fifth Avenue helped launch the taste for French \"dix-huitième\" interiors in New York City. This room and what was called a \"lady's room\" in the house of William Henry Vanderbilt at 640 Fifth Avenue ensured the American reputation of Jules Allard's firm (founded in 1878), which traded in New York as Allard and Sons from 1885, becoming the pre-eminent source for French architectural interiors until the death of Jules Allard in 1907. The firm was subsequently absorbed by Lucien Alavoine and Company.\n\nIn the leading northeastern resort of Newport, Rhode Island alone, Allard and Sons worked on the interiors of Richard Morris Hunt's The Breakers. There they cooperated with the decorator Ogden Codman, Jr. who permitted \"AF\" to be incorporated into the painted designs of the Music Room ceiling; that room and the state dining room, were entirely constructed in Allard's Paris workshops, disassembled, and shipped across the Atlantic. At Hunt's Marble House Allard's name is connected with the Gothic Room and is to be found on the bronze figures reclining on the pedimented mantel in the \"Grand Salon\". Elsewhere in Newport, at The Elms, Allard's name is cast in the bronze lion and crocodile group on the terrace; Allard worked also at Vernon Court. Allard et Fils were the favored decorators of the architect Horace Trumbauer and of Stanford White, whose own New York house in Gramercy Park was fitted out to his own designs, by Jules Allard and his son, Georges.\n\nBeginning with the highly finished ink and watercolor presentation sketches for interiors that Allard's draughtsmen could deliver through an architect the Allard workshops, working either with sketches or specification drawings from architects, could extend old panelling or equally well design and execute new, and finish their carved and molded surfaces with gilding and decorative painting, done in-house. Accurate reproductions of Louis XV and Louis XVI seat furniture could be built, gilded and upholstered. Allard maintained close connections with textile workshops to provide appropriate silks and velvets for upholstery, window curtains and portières.\n"}

He is best known for his vernacular short fiction collections \"Slapping the Table in Amazement\" (拍案驚奇), I and II.\n\nLing Mengchu was born into the Ling clan of Wucheng in northern Zhejiang province (modern day Wuxing District). His courtesy name was 'Xuanfang' (玄房) and his pseudonym was 'Chucheng' (初成).\n\nHis ancestors were government officials. His grandfather was named Ling Yueyan (凌约言). He was a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations of Ming Dynasty and in Nanjing served as an adjutant, managing legal affairs and prisons. Ling Mengchu's father was Ling Dizhi (凌迪知), styled Zhizhe (稚哲). He was a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations in 1556. He first worked in the Labor ministry as a leader, managing projects, water conservation, farmlands and so on. This was an unimportant position, but Ling Dizhi was studious and serious. Soon he was appreciated by the emperor of Ming Dynasty, and became tongpan (通判) of Ding Zhou government and Tong Zhou government.\n\nAt the time of Ling's birth, his family fortunes were declining. He had four brothers, and he was the fourth son in this family. He went to school when he was 12 and became Xiucai at age eighteen. By 1605 his mother died and he failed the next level of exams. Afterwards, he wrote Break with Ju Zi (绝交举子书). In 1623, he was 44 years old. He met with minister of the Ministry of Rites Zhu Guozhen (朱国桢). After that meeting, Ling Mengchu decided to take up writing. In 1634 he worked as a country magistrate in Shanghai. In 1637 he wrote \"Wu Sao He Bian\" (吴骚合编) with Zhang Xudong. 1643 he was promoted to tongpan of Xuzhou government.\n\nIn addition family members were actively engaged in the printing business with a local specialty of books in polychrome. The Wucheng area was adjacent to the commercial and cultural areas of Hangzhou and Suzhou where reading materials were in increasing demand. Ling Mengchu was certainly a merchant businessman and also certainly a traditional scholar with civil service ambitions.\n\nThe business motive of the Ling family was originally discussed by Ling Mengchu’s contemporary Xie Zhaozhe (谢肇浙 1567-1624) in his \"Wu zazu\" (五雜俎 - Five Assorted Offerings). Such were the times. Ling repeatedly failed at the examinations and did not take a government post until he was fifty-four. Ling would finally perish in fighting against the Li Zicheng led rebels in 1644. He is frequently associated with Feng Menglong.\n\nLing’s \"Two Slaps\" collections of short stories (\"Slapping the Table in Amazement\" and \"Slapping the Table in Amazement, vol. 2\") comprise a detailed composite portrait of his 17th century moral world, offering tales of virtue, vice, and adventure. Sometimes racy, often outrageous, and wildly imaginative, they have remained popular reading for centuries. While focusing on extraordinary events, the narratorial attitude alternates openness toward the unorthodox with reflexive Confucian conservatism, a mix also found in contemporaneous works such as Feng Menglong's \"Three Words\" trio of story collections and Zhang Yingyu's \"The Book of Swindles\". Ling was most strongly influenced by Feng Menglong, whose success he acknowledged as having emboldened him to publish commercially. \n\nIn the prefatory material to his first short story collection he insisted it was infinitely more difficult to paint a likeness of a dog or horse one had actually seen than to render a ghost or goblin one had never observed (a quotation from Han Feizi).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301510", "title": "Bivouac shelter", "text": "Bivouac shelter\n\nA bivouac shelter is any of a variety of improvised camp site, or shelter that is usually of a temporary nature, used especially by soldiers, or persons engaged in backpacking, scouting, or mountain climbing. It may often refer to sleeping in the open with a bivouac sack, but it may also refer to a shelter constructed of natural materials like a structure of branches to form a frame, which is then covered with leaves, ferns, and similar material for waterproofing and duff (leaf litter) for insulation. Modern bivouacs often involve the use of one or two man tents, but may also be without tents or full cover. In modern mountaineering the nature of the bivouac shelter will depend on the level of preparedness; in particular whether existing camping and outdoor gear may be incorporated into the shelter. A bivouac shelter is colloquially known as a bivvy (also spelled \"bivy\" or \"bivvi\" or \"bivi\").\n\nThe word \"bivouac\" is French and ultimately derives from an 18th-century Swiss German usage of \"beiwacht (bei\" by, \"wacht\" watch or patrol). It referred to an additional watch that would be maintained by a military or civilian force to increase vigilance at an encampment. Following use by the troops of the British Empire the term became also known as \"bivvy\" for short.\n\nSingle-sided designs allow easy access and allow the heat of a fire into the shelters, while full roofed designs have much better heat retention. As a general rule the roof should be at least a foot thick and opaque to block sunlight. Artificial bivouacs can be constructed using a variety of available materials from corrugated iron sheeting or plywood, to groundsheets or a purpose-made basha. Although these have the advantage of being speedy to erect and resource efficient they have relatively poor insulation properties.\n\nThere are many different ways to put up a bivouac shelter. The most common method is to use one bivouac sheet as the roof of the shelter and a second as the groundsheet. The 'roof' flysheet is suspended along in its ridge line by a cord tied between two trees which are a suitable distance apart. The four corners of the flysheet are then either pegged out or tied down to other trees. Care must be taken to leave a gap between the ground and the sheet to ensure that there is enough air flow to stop condensation.\n\nA basha is a simple tent, made from one or two sheets of waterproof fabric and some strong cord. Generally a basha is made of reinforced nylon with eyelets and loops or tabs located along all four sides of the sheet and sometimes across the two central lines of symmetry. The basha is an extremely versatile shelter that can be erected in many different ways to suit the particular conditions of the location. (The word also sometimes refers to a special type of bivouac sack (see below).\n\nA bivouac sack is a smaller type of bivouac shelter. Generally it is a portable, lightweight, waterproof shelter, and an alternative to larger bivouac shelters. The main benefit of a bivouac sack shelter is speed of setup and ability to use in a tiny space as compared to tent-like shelters. A bivouac sack is therefore a common choice for hikers or climbers who have to camp in tight areas, or in unknown areas. A bivouac sack will usually have a thin waterproof fabric shell that is designed to slip over a sleeping bag, providing an additional 5 to 10 °C of insulation and forming an effective barrier against wind chill and rain.\n\nA drawback of a simple bivy sack is the humidity that condenses on the inner side, leaving the occupant or the sleeping bag moist. Moisture severely decreases the insulating effect of sleeping bags. This problem has been alleviated somewhat in recent years with the advent of more waterproof/breathable fabrics, such as Gore-Tex, which allow some humidity to pass through the fabric while blocking most external water. A traditional bivy bag typically cinches all the way down to the user's face, leaving only a small hole to breathe or look through. Some modern fabrics are sufficiently gas-permeable that they can be safely zipped up around the user's head in order to shut out the elements completely.\n\nIn the German region of Saxon Switzerland in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains climbers refer to overnighting in the open air as \"Boofen\" (pronounced \"bo-fen\"). The spot selected for overnight stays usually comprises an overhang in the sandstone rock or a cave, the so-called \"Boofe\" (\"bo-fe\"). This has often been adapted with a sleeping area and fireplace. In the national park itself, \"Boofen\" is only permitted at designated sites and only in connection with climbing, although in this case lighting fires is absolutely forbidden. The colloquial Saxon word \"boofen\" was derived from \"pofen\" (= sleep soundly and for a long time). \n\nAn example of a bivouac being made in a time of urgency was shown when the climber Hermann Buhl made his ascent of Nanga Parbat in 1953 and was forced to bivouac alone on a rock ledge at 8000 m altitude, in order to survive until the following morning.\n\n"}

A nest is constructed out of the living ant workers' own bodies to protect the queen and larvae, and is later deconstructed as the ants move on.\n\nArmy ants can forage and feed on insects over large areas of more than 1,800 square yards in a single day, so they must constantly move to new areas. During what is called the migratory phase, the ants set up bivouacs at new sites each night. As many as 150,000 to 700,000 worker bodies cover and protect the queen, linking legs and bodies in a mass that measures a meter across. Thousands of larvae are located near the centre with the queen, and workers are responsible for feeding them. Larger workers also serve as porters, carrying larvae to new bivouacs. In the morning, the bivouac dissolves into raiding columns that form a fan-shaped front. These raiding columns can travel up to 20 metres per hour with lead workers laying a chemical trail for other workers to follow. Smaller workers lead the column, while larger, formidable soldiers protect the flanks.\n"}

The Orangemen's parade both to and from the service and the reaction of the community on Garvaghy Road has been the catalyst for sectarian unrest between the Protestant paraders and the Catholic residents of the area for more than 200 years.\n\nThe present church was consecrated by the Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore, Robert Bent Knox, on 28 October 1856. Its foundation stone was laid on 17 May 1855, which in that year was Ascension Day. The current rector is the Reverend Gary Galway, previous curate of St. Marks Parish in Portadown. The Church of Ireland parish of Drumcree has borders identical to the Roman Catholic parish of Drumcree.\n\nDrumcree (Irish language: \"Droim Crí\") is the name of the townland in which the church and the surrounding area are located. Its name means \"ridge of the boundary\", most likely referring to the River Bann. The site has been used for Christian worship since the time of the Celts. The parish of Drumcree was formed in 1110 comprising sixty-six townlands lying to the west of the Bann. Historical records list the first vicar as David Macralagen. He died in 1414. The parish remained a Catholic entity until the Reformation in the mid 16th century.\n\nIt is unclear what happened to the church during the time of the Reformation, but a map of 1609 shows the church in ruins within the churchyard. Following the Ulster Plantation in 1610 a new church was built. This was described as \"a plain stone building rough cast and whitewashed\".\n\nIn 1812 a tower was built and in 1814 a church bell was installed. In 1826 the rector, Charles Alexander, had a new rectory built. Almost thirty years later, in 1854, it was decided to build a new church. The church so built is the one that stands today and is now the oldest church in Portadown. It occupies a position roughly the same as the former church.\n\nThe Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871 and as a result Drumcree lost most of its land, known as the glebe.\n\nIn 1901 a new burial ground was established on the north side of the church. In the following year the Parochial Hall was built. A pipe organ was installed in the church in 1907 and a memorial to the Great War was built in 1921. A further burial ground known as the Terrace Burial Ground was created on the east side of the church in 1922.\n\nIn 1989 a war memorial to commemorate those lost in World War II was erected. Then in 1992 major renovation work was carried out to repair the fabric of the building.\n\nThe Orange Order was founded in and around the Co. Armagh town of Portadown in 1795. The first Orange service and 'church parade' from Drumcree was on 1 July 1795. That parade was instigated by Protestant ministers in the Portadown area. One of them, a Reverend George Maunsell gave a sermon in June 1795. Maunsell called on his congregation: \" to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne in the true spirit of the institution\" by attending a sermon to be given by a Rev. Devine of the Established Church at Drumcree on Sunday 1 July. And that 1st first Sunday church parade, like so many since, was celebrated with 'wrecking' and bloodletting in the parish of Drumcree. On page 17 of his \"History of Ireland\" (Vol. I), published in 1809, the historian Francis Plowden described the events that followed the Rev Devine's sermon:\nThis evangelical labourer in the vineyard of the Lord of peace so worked up the minds of his audience, that upon retiring from service, on the different roads leading to their respective homes, they gave full scope to the antipapistical zeal, with which he had inspired them, falling upon every Catholic they met, beating and bruising them without provocation or distinction, breaking the doors and windows of their houses, and actually murdering two unoffending Catholics in a bog. This unprovoked atrocity of the Protestants revived and redoubled religious rancour. The flame spread and threatened a contest of extermination... \n\nPlowden tells of a similar assault on Catholics in Lurgan where influential Catholics and Protestants living east of the river Bann convened a meeting and succeeded in maintaining the peace in that area. But in Portadown the Catholic Defenders: \"remained under arms for three days successively, challenging their opponents to fight it out fairly in the field rather that harass them with murderous nocturnal visits\".\nSeven weeks later, on 21 September a party of Defenders was routed by a smaller but better armed coalition of 'wreckers' at the Diamond, 4 miles from Drumcree. The 'wreckers' were under the command of a Captain Giffard from Dublin. William Blacker, a member of the landed gentry and commander of the Seagoe Yeomanry, was later attributed a role in the affray. He is said to have stripped lead from the roof of his house to make ammunition in preparation for the ambush of Catholic Defenders at the Diamond. However, we could find nothing to support this and it may be no more than a piece of Orange legend that helped establish an affinity with the aristocracy in the minds of the Protestant peasantry. It was after the Diamond skirmish that the name 'Orange Boys' was adopted. This was changed to 'the Orange Order' as the ‘wreckers’ became more organised under the leadership of Blacker and James Verner, an attorney and agent for the Armagh estates of absentee landlord, Lord Charlemont.\n\nTraditionally the Orangemen parade from the centre of Portadown, returning after the church service. The service and accompanying parades are now often represented by Orangemen as being held to commemorate the men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who died during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. \n\nPortadown is a predominantly Protestant town. The small area surrounding the Garvaghy Road is a small Catholic community within Portadown. That community has long been subjected to sectarian discrimination, marginalisation, and abuse. The Orange Order insist it is their right as citizens to march down the Garvaghy Road, a route they claim to hold traditional and communal value. The residents of Garvaghy Road insist it is their right not to be subjected to marches perceived by many as sectarian and intimidating. The stand-off between the Orangemen and the RUC Royal Ulster Constabulary, which previously colluded in facilitating the Orange demonstrations of strength, has become symbolic of the intractable sectarian divide that poisons relations between the two communities in Northern Ireland. And a local anthropologist, Peter Mulholland, has argued that Orange parades effectively deny the human rights and dignity of the minority community through annually reviving and fanning the flames of sectarian hatred.\n\nThe aforementioned Plowden report and many other instances of Orange parade-related violence during the two centuries since 1795 were documented by a small group of Portadown Nationalists in the early 1980s and circulated to journalists in 1996-7 under the title 'Two Hundred Years in the Orange Citadel'. Their research was also included in Nationalist submissions to the British government's 'North' commission of inquiry into sectarian parades.\n\nIn 1998 the Northern Ireland Parades Commission banned the Orangeman's parade. Every year since then the parade has been prevented from parading down the Garvaghy Road. In an attempt to defuse the situation the General Synod of the Church of Ireland has requested the Reverend John Pickering, Rector of Drumcree Church, to refrain from holding the Orangemen's service. The Primate of the Church of Ireland, Dr. Robin Eames, stated that \"It is a form of blasphemy if, following a religious service, those who have attended it engage in behaviour which makes a mockery of such a service.\" Pickering has, however, refused the request, maintaining that \"the doors of my church are open to anyone, including Orangemen\".\n\nIn 2007, following the Northern Ireland power-sharing agreement, the Orange Order parade passed peacefully. The Order is still blocked from marching down the Garvaghy Road.\n\n"}

A coupling facility is a mainframe processor (runs in an own LPAR, with dedicated physical CP, defined thru HMC), with memory and special channels (CF Links), and a specialised operating system called Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC). It has no I/O devices, other than the CF links. The information in the CF resides entirely in memory as CFCC is not a virtual memory operating system. A CF typically has a large memory – of the order of several gigabytes. In principle any IBM mainframe can serve as a coupling facility. The CF runs no application software.\n\nWhen originally introduced, the CFCC executed in a separate mainframe unit that was essentially a processor without I/O facilities other than the CF links. Later IBM enabled the use of an Internal Coupling Facility where the CFCC runs in a logical partition (LPAR) defined in standard processor complex and communicates over internal links within that processor complex hardware. Links to another processor unit are over copper cables. More than one CF is typically configured in a Sysplex cluster for reliability and availability. Recovery support in the z/OS operating system allows structures to be rebuilt in the alternate CF in the event of a failure.\n\nSupported by CFs, a Sysplex cluster scales very well up to several hundreds of CPUs (in up to 32 members, each with up to 64 CPUs) running transaction and data base applications. Using the CF links, data can be directly exchanged between the CF memory and the memory of the attached systems, using a direct memory access like mechanism, without interrupting a running program. Systems in a Sysplex cluster store CF information in local memory in an area called a bit vector. This enables them to locally query critical state information of other systems in the Sysplex without the need for issuing requests to the CF. The System z Architecture includes 18 special machine instructions and additional hardware features supporting CF operation.\n\nA CF is used for three purposes:\nThese three purposes are catered for by three types of structure:\nA structure is a dedicated portion of CF memory. It is said to be connected to by specific CF-exploiting applications on the coupled z/OS systems. A typical Parallel Sysplex contains several structures of each type. Each software exploiter may use several structures of each type. For example, each DB2 Data Sharing Group uses one Lock structure, one List structure and several cache structures (one for each Group Buffer Pool (GBP)).\n\nStructures may be duplexed across different CFs, allowing two copies of the same structure to be kept synchronised. Duplexing is often used as part of an installation's drive to remove single points of failure, with the aim of reducing the incidence and duration of application outages. In the event of the failure of one CF, the other copy of the structure is used to satisfy all requests.\n\nA request to a CF structure is of one of two kinds:\nExploiting z/OS applications explicitly issue CF requests as synch or asynch.\n\nIn z/OS Release 2, the \"Dynamic Request Conversion\" heuristic algorithm was introduced. This uses sampled response times to decide whether to convert Sync requests to Async or not. These decisions are based on such criteria as coupled processor speed. The greater the distance between the coupled z/OS system and the CF the greater the likelihood requests will be converted to Async from Sync.\n\nAsync requests are never converted to Sync.\n\nThis heuristic algorithm complements a previously-existing algorithm that automatically (but not heuristically) converted requests, based on conditions such as path busy and on request data size. The difference is the new algorithm samples response times dynamically.\n\nCFs are unique to S/390, zSeries and System z mainframes. They are key to Parallel Sysplex technology.\n\nThe CFCC code is released as \"Levels\", usually denoted by their \"CFLEVEL\". For example, CFLEVEL 15 was announced in April 2007. Each level brings new function and sometimes improved performance. In most cases the new function or performance improvement requires a corequisite release of z/OS and perhaps new function in some subsystem (such as DB2). One such example is Coupling Facility Structure Duplexing. (Sometimes support from the operating system and subsystems is available via PTFs rather than a full release.)\n"}

{"id": "2301542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301542", "title": "Sleeping Bride", "text": "Sleeping Bride\n\nOn March 13, 1954, a passenger plane crashes in Japan, killing all but one passenger: a woman who is nine months pregnant. Ultimately she dies in a hospital, but her unborn daughter is saved. However, for a reason inexplicable by the science of the day, the daughter (named Yumi) does not wake up and is essentially in a comatose state. Her wealthy father has her placed in a hospital where she will be cared for indefinitely (and also offers a reward to anyone who can wake her) while he vanishes in search of a cure to her condition.\n\nSeven years later (March 25, 1961) Yuichi (a boy who is roughly seven himself) is admitted to the same hospital (with asthma) and discovers Yumi. After being told of her condition and then reading the story of Sleeping Beauty, he resolves to awaken Yumi by kissing her. Saying, \"Wake up, I'm the prince,\" he kisses her on the lips. This has no effect, but Yuichi is undeterred, and makes a routine of this, even after he leaves the hospital, repeating the same line and kissing her. Although a nurse finds this \"cute\" and lets him continue, when Doctor Hikawa discovers his actions, he ejects Yuichi from the hospital, infuriated that Yuichi believes that he can awaken the girl, whom he himself could not awaken with all the powers of medical science.\n\nFor the next ten years Yuichi does not visit the hospital at all, until February 14, 1972 when he sees a new report on Yumi who, after 17 years, has still never awoken. Overcome by the memories of his childhood, Yuichi returns to the hospital, and although initially thwarted by a new (apparently American) nurse, he eventually resumes his ten-year-old routine, with similarly little results, although more genuine emotion. Doctor Hikawa – now a Director of the Hospital – gradually becomes aware of his actions.\n\nAfter Yuichi accidentally kisses a girl at school as part of an elaborate setup on the part of his friends, he rushes to the hospital (it would appear he considered it an act of infidelity) despite the rain and late hour, and passionately kisses Yumi. He does not use the \"Wake up, I'm the prince\" line, but instead begs her (apparently in his thoughts), stating, \"I'm no prince, I'm Yuichi Nasagawa, but please wake up, I want to talk to you.\" Though it would appear to have no effect at first, as Yuichi is leaving he notices some movement, and then he realises that Yumi has indeed awoken.\n\nPromptly, the silent Yumi is besieged by a team of doctors and nurses who start to run series of tests, essentially ignoring and shutting out Yuichi. Yuichi, seeing that Yumi has been revived only to become some sort of human guinea pig, abducts her. Although Yumi has the mentality of a baby (even lacking the ability to walk or talk) they have a mutually enjoyable time together, until Yumi is reminded* of the crash-site in which her mother died, and is returned to the hospital by orderlies.\n\nYumi is seen in bed, at night, with her eyes open; Yumi does not sleep at all any more.\n\nThe next day (the \"second day\" that Yumi is awake), Yumi has advanced to the mentality of a young child, able to speak and read, and also an amazing talent for photo-realistic art, as she draws the image of her father. Yuichi returns after school and is immediately recognised by Yumi. They (this time by mutual consent, and accompanied by orderlies) walk outside in the grounds of the hospital. Upon sighting a bus (which Yumi seems to want to ride) Yuichi decides to give the orderlies (who have the air of cartoon comic-relief thugs to them) the slip, and does so successfully. They have an enjoyable \"date\" together (although Yumi is still only capable of conversing in simple terms).\n\nBy the third day Yumi has been discovered by the media and is being paraded all over for the press. Yuichi, Yuichi's nurse (who retired), and Yumi's father all witness the report on TV. Yuichi, once more, decides of his own accord that this is not \"right\" (although unlike when she was being tested, Yumi can clearly be seen to be distressed by many of the questions about her own genesis) and abducts Yumi once more. By this time Yumi has acquired the vocal and cognitive abilities approximately the same as other girls her age.\n\nYumi and Yuichi have their first conversation as intellectual equals. Yumi asks several philosophical questions about life and death. She declares that she only has two more days left before she falls asleep again (she gives no explanation as to how she acquired this knowledge, but she simply has it). Overall, she only has five days to be awake. She goes on to inquire about a strange emotion she has when she thinks of someone. After hearing the description, Yuichi explains the emotion is probably love. Yumi declares that, therefore, she is in love with Doctor Hikawa, shattering Yuichi.\n\nYuichi comes to the conclusion that someone told Yumi that she could only be awake for five days while she was asleep, and as such she believes it, but it is not true. He urges Hikawa to marry Yumi, as Yumi apparently loves him, and Yuichi's primary concern is Yumi's happiness. Hikawa does not believe in the five-day limit either, or that Yumi really loves him. Yumi hears their conversation through the door and is herself, heart-broken. She attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but she is stopped by Yuichi.\n\nOn the fourth day, Yuichi's old nurse returns to the hospital to see Yumi, who is now in a state of depression. After hearing the story from Yuichi, she reveals that Hikawa had been doing something sexual to her at night, and that she left the hospital upon discovering this. Yuichi is infuriated, he confronts Hikawa and punches him, knocking him to the floor. Hikawa does not get up, but simply talks, his head lying down, not facing anything, of how Yumi was abandoned by her parents, and God. She was left only with him, but he was unable to help her. He explains that it was because he was unwilling to admit his impotency that he did what he did.\n\nYuichi returns to Yumi. Yumi explains that she heard someone, for a long time, praying for her to wake up, and then felt something that made her feel very warm. She thought this was Doctor Hikawa, and as such, that she loved him. Yuichi kisses her, and she realises the kiss was what made her warm, and by extension, it was Yuichi who prayed to her, and he whom she loved all along. They continue to kiss, and presumably make love. The same night they announce to Yuichi's mother that they are getting married.\n\nOn the fifth and final day of the film, Yuichi and Yumi are wed. Although Yumi's father watches and is happy to see that his daughter has found happiness, he does not reveal himself, but simply leaves once more, content. Hikawa arrives after the wedding and speaks alone to Yuichi about the fifth day limit. While he maintains that it is simply autosuggestion, he reminds Yuichi that it is real for Yumi. When Yuichi asks what to do, all Hikawa can suggest is prayer.\n\nThat night as Yumi and Yuichi depart on their honeymoon on a train, Yumi states, \"I will be with Yuichi forever,\" and that she remembers everything about him, even in sleep, going on to list all the things they did together. Yumi's speech is rather bittersweet. Despite the fact she appears genuinely happy at moments, she is also on the verge of tears. Yuichi has a similar mix of anxiety and sorrow. Yumi inquires if Yuichi believes in God. Yuichi replies, that if God is the one who only allows her to be awake for five days, then he does not believe in him. Yumi says she will tell God that the world is \"very big,\" paraphrasing something Yuichi told her before. Finally, she states she will thank God for meeting Yuichi as well, and then she drifts off to sleep. Yuichi tries to wake her, eventually even resorting to the sleeping-beauty kiss. Yumi opens her eyes briefly and says, \"I… am… happy,\" before falling asleep once more, forever.\n\nTwenty seven years later (August 7, 1999), an aged Yuichi, now a scientist, returns home from work and talks to his wife. Yumi, herself aged, but not dramatically (her hair has greyed, but presumably her face has not wrinkled since she has not been moving) and still sleeps. As he is showing her a picture of a friend's son, he notices she has stopped breathing – Yumi is dead.\n\nAs Yuichi watches the video of Yumi talking to the press (before he, in his youth, liberates her – i.e. the third day) he explains by monologue that after her death he had an autopsy performed on Yumi. When her brain was removed, it was completely transparent, and beautiful. He believes that although she was only awake for five days, she was happier than anyone else.\n\nThe film ends, replaying the earlier footage of Yumi and Yuichi running from the press. Yumi happily calls, \"Yuichi!\" and he retorts, \"The world is very big, Yumi.\"\n\n"}

It was released on March 2, 1985 by Geffen Records as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album. Film producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song. After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song about the situation in which the lead characters meet at a nightclub. Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, and they felt that \"Crazy for You\" would be dropped from the soundtrack. However, a new version was recorded to their liking.\n\nJohn \"Jellybean\" Benitez was the record producer of \"Crazy for You\", and it was a challenge for him, as previously he was associated with recording dance-pop songs only. Initially Warner Bros. Records did not want the song to be released as a single, since they believed that it would take away the attention from Madonna's second studio album \"Like a Virgin\" (1984). In the end, Peters and Guber convinced Warner officials to greenlight its release. \"Crazy for You\" ushered a new musical direction for Madonna, as she had not previously released a ballad as a single. The track features instrumentation from snare drums, harp, bass synthesizer and electric guitar. Lyrically, the song speaks of sexual desire between two lovers and consists of innuendos.\n\n\"Crazy for You\" received positive response from music critics and earned Madonna her first Grammy Award nomination in the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance category. The song became Madonna's second number-one single on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and reached the top of the charts of Australia and Canada. It also peaked at number two in Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it was released twice, in 1985 and 1991. Madonna has performed \"Crazy for You\" during The Virgin Tour in 1985, Re-Invention World Tour in 2004 and in some dates of Rebel Heart Tour in 2016. The performance from The Virgin Tour was included in the on VHS and LaserDisc. \"Crazy for You\" has been covered by a number of artists.\n\n\"Crazy for You\" was written by John Bettis and Jon Lind. The ballad was released as the first single from the soundtrack of the 1985 film \"Vision Quest\", a coming of age drama about a high school wrestler, played by Matthew Modine. Film producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber and music director Phil Ramone were aware of the then unknown Madonna, who was just signed to Sire Records. Ramone took her for dinner at his house in Carolwood Records, where she played some of her music videos. Ramone and the other Warner executives present there, were impressed by Madonna's self-possession and fishnet-crucifix style, and they decided to test her voice in a New York studio. Peters assigned Joel Sill, an executive in charge of music at Warner Bros. Pictures, to handle the recording of the two songs for the film. Sill sent the script of the film to Bettis and Lind. After reading through the script, Bettis wanted to write a song about the situation where the main characters – a young boy and a girl boarding at a house – dance together at a nightclub. He elaborated:\n\n\"We were noodling around and 'Crazy for You' was something that Jon was singing over that section of the song. It was really descriptive of the scene in the film. [...] After that, I was out on vacation out in the desert and [Sill] called and said Phil Ramone was in love with the song and wanted to cut it on Madonna. [Laughing] 'Borderline' was out at that time and I said, 'Excuse me? This is for Madonna? Really? Can she sing a song like this?' Jon and I were surprised at the choice of artist at the time, if you want to know the truth.\"\nAfter Sill let Bettis and Lind know that Madonna was singing the song, some time elapsed before either of them heard anything from Warner Bros. Records. In between, they went to one of the recording sessions and were not impressed with the process of recording the song. Bettis commented, \"We went to one of the sessions, and to be honest, that particular session did not go all that well. [...] Jon and I were depressed about the way the song had come out. We heard nothing else about it and we were a little nervous that the song was going to be dropped from the picture.\" Bettis went to England to work on the 1985 fantasy film \"Legend\" with music producer Jerry Goldsmith. It was there he received a call from Lind, who informed Bettis that a new version of \"Crazy for You\" was recorded and was made ready for a single release. Bettis was surprised and went over to Lind's house, where he warmly received the new recorded version of the song. It had a different arrangement from the demo version, and the arrangement was done by composer Rob Mounsey who rearranged the original track and added the background vocals. Bettis said: \"We owe a big debt of gratitude to [Mounsey]. He really made a hit record out of [the song].\" Mounsey was introduced in the project by record producer John \"Jellybean\" Benitez who was producing \"Crazy for You\". Benitez was previously associated with producing dance-pop themed songs and it was the first time that he produced a ballad. In Fred Bronson's \"The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits\", Benitez commented,\n\n\"The song was recorded live. It was the first time that I produced a live session, as opposed to having synthesizers and drum machines do everything. [...] I was tense because I had never done a record like this. [...] Everything I did was totally on instinct. I tried to make the song stand on its own, but at the same time work in the two scenes in which it was used in the movie.\"\n\nBenitez also noted that \"Crazy for You\" was an important recording for Madonna, as the song being a ballad, was openly accepted at adult contemporary radios. She had already charted with her singles \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Material Girl\", hence Madonna wanted to prove that she can sing in a different genre of music. However, Warner initially did not want the song to be released as a single, since the release of \"Vision Quest\" coincided with the release of Madonna's second studio album \"Like a Virgin\" and releasing \"Crazy for You\" would have distracted attention from the album. Warner Bros. Records chief Mo Ostin went to Robert A. Daly, chairman of Warner, and requested him to pull out the Madonna tracks from the \"Vision Quest\" soundtrack. Daly summoned Peters and Guber to his office and informed them that they had to let-go of the Madonna tracks. Peters protested and shouted at Daly, resulting him escaping in fright and Warner allowing \"Crazy for You\" to be released as a single.\n\n\"Crazy for You\" was a new musical direction for Madonna, as she had not recorded ballad songs before. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the song is sophisticated compared to her previous singles. The introduction features a melody by a woodwind instrument and an electric guitar chord, sliding from one motif to the other. It has a snare drum on the last beat of the bar, leading to the spacey quality to most of the verses. Other instrumentation comes from a harp, a bass synthesizer and a chattering single note guitar lick. The fuller rhythm of the song does not start, until the chorus is reached. The turn of the melody allows Madonna's voice to stretch further on the higher notes.\n\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, \"Crazy for You\" is set in the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. It is set in the key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning between the high note of C to the low note of G. The song has a basic sequence of E–A–B–A as its chord progression. Unlike her previous singles, the chord sequence does not repeat itself and the chorus slowly unravels to the climax of the song. Lyrically, the song talks about extreme love for one another. It contains innuendos similar to The Crystals' 1963 song \"Then He Kissed Me\". According to scholar Dave Marsh, the lyrics talk about frank sexual desire among two teenagers. He believed that the line \"I'm crazy for you, Touch me once and you'll know it's true\" was not ambiguous and it helped Madonna to capitalize on such disambiguation.\n\nKeith Caulfield of \"Billboard\" said that \"Crazy for You\" is \"[p]erhaps the ultimate slow-dance song.\" Rikky Rooksby, author of \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\", called the song sophisticated. Alex Henderson of Allmusic felt that the other Madonna song on the \"Vision Quest\" soundtrack, \"Gambler\", should have been the more successful single. Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli characterized the song as \"sassy\" and commented that the song provided proof that Madonna was vocally capable of delivering a serious ballad. Author Andrew Morton believed that the song cemented Madonna as a talented and serious singer which \"had been missing from her past recordings.\" Allen Metz and Carol Benson, authors of \"The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary\", said that the song sounded like a \"remake of sweet-sixteen Connie Francis tune, dripping with old-fashioned, hand-held romance\" especially in the line \"It's so brand new; I'm really crazy for you.\" Edna Gundersen from \"USA Today\" felt that the song is \"touching and beautifully arranged.\"\n\nDave Marsh, author of \"The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made\", felt that with the coda of the song, Madonna transformed her record into an adult love song. William McKeen, author of \"Rock and Roll is Here to Stay: An Anthology\", said that the song \"offered an aggressive sexuality for women\". Maria Raha, author of \"Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground\", said that with the song, \"Madonna brought a trunk full of trite lyrics on the long-standing tradition of pop music, love.\"\n\n\"Crazy for You\" was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at 1986 Grammy Awards, but lost to Whitney Houston's \"Saving All My Love for You\". The song was ranked number 38 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Love Songs\", and during the special it was revealed that \"Crazy for You\" was recorded in one take. In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time by \"Q\"; \"Crazy for You\" was allocated the eleventh spot.\n\nIn the United States, \"Crazy for You\" became Madonna's second number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song debuted on the chart at number 55 on the issue dated March 2, 1985. After six weeks, the song reached the top of the chart, replacing \"We Are the World\" by USA for Africa. \"Crazy for You\" was the second number-one song for Bettis as a songwriter, after \"Top of the World\" by The Carpenters (1973). With \"Crazy for You\", Bettis was in doubt whether the song would reach the top, after it was stuck at number two for three weeks, behind \"We Are the World\". Both he and Lind commented, \"If you gotta lose to something, it might as well be 'We Are the World'. Luckily enough, the final week of the upsurge of the record, we topped 'We Are the World', which lets you know how hot the song and how hot the artist [Madonna] was.\" \n\n\"Crazy for You\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 16, 1985, for shipment of one million copies of the single across United States—the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989. The song reached number two on the Adult Contemporary Singles (behind \"Rhythm of the Night\" by DeBarge), and 80 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It placed at nine on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year. In Canada, the song debuted at number 70 on the \"RPM\" issue dated March 16, 1985. On its eleventh week on the chart, the song reached the top position. It was present on the chart for a total of 25 weeks and was ranked seventh on the \"RPM\" Year-end chart for 1985. A music video was released, featuring Madonna singing the song in a night-club. The video was included in \"\", released in 2009.\n\n\"Crazy for You\" reached number one in Australia and displaced another Madonna release, \"Angel\"/\"Into the Groove\", from the top spot on the Kent Music Report chart, making Madonna one of the few acts in Australian chart history to replace themselves at the number-one spot. After the song was released in the United Kingdom on June 8, 1985, it debuted at number 25 and peaked at number two. In February 1991, the song was re-released and again reached a peak of number two. \"Crazy for You\" was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 500,000 copies across United Kingdom. Such was Madonna's popularity that when \"Vision Quest\" was released in home video in the UK, it was renamed as \"Crazy for You\", to cash in on her success. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 781,900 copies there as of August 2016. \"Crazy for You\" was also a number-two hit in Ireland and New Zealand. The song reached the top 20 in Belgium, Europe, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and top 40 in Austria, France and Germany.\n\nMadonna first performed \"Crazy for You\" on The Virgin Tour in 1985. She wore a black top and long black skirt with her hair in knots and a crucifix attached. After an energetic performance of \"Lucky Star\", Madonna sat on some steps and sang \"Crazy for You\". Paul Grein, music editor of \"Billboard\", commented that \"She was at her best on 'Crazy for You', making good use of a deeper, huskier vocal quality that mirrors the song's deeper lyrical approach. The performance was included in the VHS release \"\" recorded in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, Madonna performed the song in the last segment of the show, the \"Scottish\" segment. During that segment, she wore a Scottish kilt and a t-shirt which had different captions in different venues; usually it had the caption \"Kabbalists Do It Better\", however she also had \"Brits Do It Better\" and \"Irish Do It Better\" on the British and Irish stops of the tour, respectively. Generally after finishing the performance of \"Papa Don't Preach\", Madonna would dedicate the next song to the fans of twenty years, and start singing \"Crazy for You\" on top of a rising platform. At the end of the performance, she would usually throw her t-shirt to the audience. The performance was excluded from the album of the documentary on the tour titled \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\", which was released in 2006.\n\nOn February 25, 2016, Madonna performed \"Crazy for You\" during the Manila stop of her Rebel Heart Tour as a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the 1986 EDSA Revolution. Before the performance she said; \"I believe 30 years ago you fought for your freedom, am I correct? It's called People Power Freedom [sic], did I say that right? Up with democracy and freedom! That is the revolution of love. And that's what a rebel heart fights for. So on this very special occasion, I want to sing this song\".\n\nPhilippine acoustic band MYMP recorded a cover version and released it their album \"New Horizon\" (2006). In 2007, Groove Armada recorded a cover with Alan Donohoe of art rock band The Rakes on vocals for the compilation \"Radio 1 Established 1967\". New Found Glory recorded a pop punk cover of the song with Max Bemis for their 2007 album \"From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II\". A cover of the song by Lion of Panjshir was included on the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation \"Through the Wilderness\". Melissa Totten did a Hi-NRG cover for her 2008 dance album, \"Forever Madonna\". An instrumental version was played in the \"Full House\" episode \"13 Candles\" when Kimmy dares D.J. to kiss Kevin at her party. The original Madonna recording was also featured in the 2004 film \"13 Going on 30\", starring Jennifer Garner. At the end of the film, the song is played again, but to signify Jenna Rink's life staying on the \"good path\" 17 years later, and a bigger, modern rock/string orchestration by the film's composer Theodore Shapiro is added. Kelly Clarkson covered the song during her 2012 Stronger Tour per fan request in Bossier City, Louisiana. \"Crazy for You\" was also featured in the 2016 web film \"The Do-Over\" with vocals by Adam Sandler and David Spade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the soundtrack's liner notes.\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Digital\n\n"}

Gorm and Thyra were the parents of King Harald Bluetooth.\n\nWhile Gorm the Old had disparaging nicknames, his wife Thyra was referred to as a woman of great prudence. Saxo Grammaticus wrote that Thyra was mainly responsible for building the Danevirke on the southern border, but archeology has proven it to be much older, and Thyra's role was to extend it.\n\nThyra died before Gorm, who raised a memorial stone to Thyra at Jelling, which refers to her as the \"Pride of Denmark\" or the \"Ornament of Denmark\" (Old Danish: \"tanmarka but\", Modern Danish: \"Dannebod\"). Gorm and Thyra were buried under one of the two great mounds at Jelling, and later moved to the first Christian church there. This was confirmed when a tomb containing their remains was excavated in 1978 under the east end of the present church.\n\nAccounts of Thyra's parentage are late, contradictory and chronologically dubious. Saxo names her father as Ethelred, King of England (usually identified with Æthelred of Wessex), but his description of her brother as Æthelstan suggests he intended Edward the Elder, though no such daughter appears in the detailed lists of Edward's children that survive. \"Jómsvíkinga saga\" and Snorri's \"Heimskringla\" say her father was a king or \"jarl\" of Jutland or Holstein called Harald Klak.\n\nTradition also has it that before Thyra consented to marry Gorm, she insisted he build a new house and sleep in it for the first three nights of winter and give her an account of his dreams those nights. The dreams were told at the wedding banquet and as recorded, imitate the dreams Pharaoh had that were interpreted by Joseph in Genesis. In the first dream, three white boars came out of the sea, fed on the grass, and went back to the sea. In the second, three red boars came out of the sea, and did the same. In the third dream, three black boars with great tusks did the same, but when they returned to the sea, there was such a loud rush of the waves returning to the land that the noise could be heard throughout Denmark.\nThyra's interpretation was that the three white boars represented three very cold, snowy winters which would kill \"all the fruits of the ground.\" The red boars meant there would next be three mild winters, while the black boars with tusks indicated there would be wars in the land. The fact that they all went back into the sea showed that their effect would not be long-lasting. The loud noise as the waves of the sea rolled back on the Danish shores meant that \"mighty men would come on the land with great wars, and many of his relations would take part.\" She said that had he dreamed of the black boars and the rushing waves the first night, she would not have married him, but now, since she would be available to provide advice, there would be little injury from the wars.\n\nAsteroid 115 Thyra is named in her honour.\n\n\n"}

It is a National Monument and has a priceless historical value being one of the main tourist attractions among the older monuments belonging to the university.\n\nThe \"Casa da Livraria\" (\"House of the Library\"), the name that it was known, received its first books in 1750, its construction completed between 1717 and 1728.\n\nOver the entrance door, the library exhibits the national coat of arms. Inside, there are three great rooms divided by decorated arches, bearing the same style as the portal and entirely executed by Portuguese artists. The walls are covered by two storied shelves, in gilded or painted exotic woods; the painted ceilings, by the Lisbon artists Simões Ribeiro and Vicente Nunes, blend harmoniously with the rest of the decoration.\n\nThe building has three floors and shelters about 200000 volumes, of which 40000 are located on the first floor. These bibliographic collections can be consulted, by request, with justification and motives for the need to consultation. Upon approval, the referenced work is taken to the \"Biblioteca Geral\" by functionary, where the document can be examined. The care taken in this respect is a direct consequence of the rarity and age of the documents in the library; the collection date from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, whose majority represent the best works from Europe at the time. The library contains about 250 thousand volumes, namely works of medicine, geography, history, humanistic studies, science, civil and canon law, philosophy and theology.\n\nAll the bibliographic works are in the best condition since the building is a perfect vault, with a stable environment, throughout the year, from summer to winter. The building was conceived as a \"library house\" constructed with exterior walls around thick. The door of the \"vault\" is constructed of teak, that permits the space maintain a constant temperature of . To maintain this stable environment the humidity hovers around 60%, thereby conditioning the wood interior. In addition to issues of humidity and temperature, the stacks are affected by another \"enemy\": papirófagos, insects that survive on paper. But, the structure is protected by being constructed of oak woods, that, in addition to its dense nature (which makes it difficult for wood penetration, elicits an odor that is repellent to these insects.\n\nThe library is noted as being one of two in the world (the Mafra palace library being the other) whose books are protected from insects by the presence of a colony of bats within the library. During the night, the bats consume the insects that appear, eliminating the pest and assisting the maintenance of the stacks. Each night, workers cover the \"bufets\" (credenzas) with sheets of leather. In the morning the library is cleaned of bat guano.\n\n"}

This includes direct sunlight, diffuse sky radiation, and (often) both of these reflected by Earth and terrestrial objects, like landforms and buildings. Sunlight scattered or reflected by objects in outer space (that is, beyond Earth's atmosphere) is generally not considered daylight. Thus, daylight excludes moonlight, despite it being reflected indirect sunlight. \"Daytime\" is the period of time each day when daylight occurs. Daylight happens as Earth rotates, and either side on which the Sun shines is considered daylight.\n\nDaylight is present at a particular location, to some degree, whenever the Sun is above the local horizon. (This is true for slightly more than 50% of the Earth at any given time. For an explanation of why it is not exactly half, see here). However, the outdoor illuminance can vary from 120,000 lux for direct sunlight at noon, which may cause eye pain, to less than 5 lux for thick storm clouds with the Sun at the horizon (even <1 lux for the most extreme case), which may make shadows from distant street lights visible. It may be darker under unusual circumstances like a solar eclipse or very high levels of atmospheric particulates, which include smoke (see New England's Dark Day), dust, and volcanic ash.\n\nFor comparison, nighttime illuminance levels are:\n\nFor a table of approximate daylight intensity in the Solar System, see sunlight.\n\nDaylighting is lighting an indoor space with openings such as windows and skylights that allow daylight into the building. This type of lighting is chosen to save energy, to avoid hypothesized adverse health effects of over-illumination by artificial light, and also for aesthetics. The amount of daylight received into an indoor space or room is defined as a daylight factor, being the ratio between the measured internal and external light levels. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights because daylight is present, or by dimming/switching electric lights automatically in response to the presence of daylight, a process known as daylight harvesting.\n\nIn recent years, work has taken place to recreate the effects of daylight artificially. This is however expensive in terms of both equipment and energy consumption and is applied almost exclusively in specialist areas such as filmmaking, where light of such intensity is required anyway. In some filmmaking locations, such as Sweden or Norway, there is too much light due to long summer days. As a result, in location films such as \"Marianne\" (2011), night scenes have to be shot during daylight hours and are digitally altered later.\n\n\n"}

It was released on April 10, 1985 by Sire Records as the album's third single. Written by Madonna and Steve Bray, it was one of the first songs developed for the project and, according to Madonna, was inspired by a girl who is saved by an angel, and she falls in love with him. \"Angel\" was released as a 12\" single with \"Into the Groove\" in some countries and charted likewise. A music video was planned but was canceled, and a promotional clip comprising segments of her previous videos was released in the United Kingdom.\n\nMusically \"Angel\" consists of three chord ascending hook, which serves for the verse and chorus. It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour. Critical response to the song varied, with some music critics calling it a classic and others deeming it sub-par compared to Madonna's previous singles. \"Angel\" became the singer's fifth consecutive top-five single on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and reached the top of its dance charts. It was also able to reach number-one in Australia and the top-five of the charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. Madonna has performed the song only once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. The song was used at the soundtrack of the 3rd season of \"Stranger Things\".\n\n\"Angel\" was written by Madonna and Steve Bray and released worldwide on April 10, 1985. The song first began as a demo and was recorded as early as April 1984 for her second studio album, \"Like a Virgin\". However, the whole project was held off, much to Madonna's frustration, by the continuing sales of her self-titled debut album, which had by then sold over a million copies in United States. She had decided to release \"Angel\" as the initial single from the album, but changed her mind, after the recording of the title track \"Like a Virgin\" was complete. \"Angel\" was an ode to \"a heavenly love\" and inspired from Madonna's Catholic upbringing with the singer saying, \"I think it's important to call angels to you to protect you... That's part of the ritualistic moment. The calling of angels.\" The track was ultimately released as the third single, and included the song \"Into the Groove\", from Madonna's 1985 film \"Desperately Seeking Susan\", on the B-side of the 12-inch maxi-single.\n\nMadonna had initially planned to release a music video for \"Angel\", but later decided to go against it, as at that time, there were already five Madonna music videos on-rotation in the music channels and were being broadcast continuously. Hence, Warner Bros. and Madonna felt that adding another video to the already saturated channels, might not be in her favour. A promotional video, containing scenes from the music videos of \"Burning Up\", \"Borderline\", \"Lucky Star\", \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Material Girl\" was made by Warner Bros. Records and aired in the United Kingdom. The video was included on the promotional-only video compilations \"It's That Girl\" and \"She's Breathless\".\n\n\"Angel\" begins with a laugh and an echo, panning from left to the right. The song is built on an ascending hook consisting of three chord sequence, which serves for the verse and chorus. It consists of a constant 8th rhythm throughout the song, making it sound similar to the songs of the band Machine. Vocal harmonies are also added beneath the main chorus. It is a two-bar phrase song, and laughter is again added as the song slowly fades out. Madonna sings in her lower register at the beginning, and shifts to the higher one in the line \"I can see it in your e-e-e-eyye-e-s\". The line was taken from the song \"Death Disco\" (1979), by the British musical group Public Image Ltd. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in common time, with a medium tempo of 133 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the low-note of G to the high-note of B. The song has a basic sequence of Am–Bm–C as its chord progression. The lyrics continuously repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour.\n\nRikky Rooksby, author of \"Madonna: The Complete Guide to Her Music\", commented that \"Angel\" is a song \"that is less than even the sum of its parts\". Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of \"Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Cultural Transformations\", felt that \"the pizzicato synthesizer line that opens 'Angel' was indeed classical Madonna\". John Leland from \"Spin\" called it a rehash of Madonna's previous single \"Lucky Star\" (1984), with \"an even lamer melody and punch. [...] 'Angel' is Nile Rodgers doing what he does best: turning crass product into cash product\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called the song \"excellent standard-issue dance-pop\". Sal Cinquemani from \"Slant Magazine\" called the song sugary. Also from \"Slant Magazine\", Eric Henderson opined it was \"the ultimate “this is better than I remember it” single of Madonna’s career, 'Angel' is best half-remembered, the better by which to keep rediscovering it again and again\".\n\n\"Billboard\"s Joe Lynch deemed it a \"a sadly undervalued gem from her second album [...] this ineffably charming dance-pop lark also features some of Madge's cutest come-ons\". Also from \"Billboard\", Nancy Erlich called the song \"romantic, uncontroversial techno-pop. [...] [Madonna's] reign continues as '85's premier media obsession\". While reviewing \"Like a Virgin\" in 1995, Dave Karger from \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that the song comes off as a bit repetitious and immature. Alfred Soto of Stylus Magazine commented that \"'Angel' is a particular stunner, certainly the apex of Rodgers' post-Chic skills. [...] It does a better job than the two big singles of delineating the boundaries of Madonna's determined shallowness, an act that confounds Philistines today and made the appreciation of her musical skills a lot harder than it took these critics to dismiss Cyndi Lauper as the real charlatan\". From \"The Guardian\", Jude Rogers felt it was \"an early pass at religious-ecstasy pop, but needing bigger wings\". Medium's Richard LaBeau was also critical; \"[this] sweet and catchy ditty features one of her better early vocal performances but deviates too little from the template of her early tracks to be a standout\".\n\nAfter its release, \"Angel\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 48 on the issue dated April 27, 1985, while her previous single \"Crazy for You\" was at number-two on the chart. After ten weeks, \"Angel\" reached a peak position of five on the chart. The song tied Madonna with Olivia Newton-John, as the female artist with the most consecutive top-five hits on the Hot 100 at that time. \"Angel\" debuted on the Adult Contemporary chart for the issue dated May 11, 1985, and reached a peak of five. The song debuted at number 40 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart on June 1, 1985, and reached the top after three weeks. It also charted on a number of \"Billboard\" charts, such as reaching the top of the Hot Dance Singles Sales and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at position 71. On July 30, 1985, \"Angel\" and \"Into the Groove\" were together certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the shipment of one million copies across United States—the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989. It was the first 12-inch single to be certified gold, since Frankie Smith's \"Double Dutch Bus\" (1981). \"Angel/Into the Groove\" placed at number 81 on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year.\n\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 80 on the \"RPM\" issue dated May 4, 1985. After eight weeks, the song reached a peak of five on the chart. \"Angel\" was present on the chart for 25 weeks and ranked at number 56 on the 1985 \"RPM\" Year-end chart. The song was released in the United Kingdom with \"Burning Up\" as its B-Side, and debuted at number ten on the UK Singles Chart on September 9, 1985. It reached a peak of five next week, and was present for a total of 12 weeks on the chart. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 205,000 copies there. In Australia, \"Angel\" charted as a combined single with \"Into the Groove\" and topped the Kent Music Report chart for four weeks. It was the second highest selling single of 1985 in Australia. The song reached the top 20 in the charts of Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland and the European Hot 100 Singles.\n\nThe song was performed as part of Madonna's 1985 Virgin Tour; it was the fifth song of the setlist. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around an ear and her neck. As she finished the vigorous performance of \"Everybody\", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of the song started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change. \"Angel\" did not appear in the final home video release \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n\n"}

Nick Brimble, Rosanna Arquette, Lynn Whitfield, and Willie Nelson co-star. This film is the only collaboration between Glover and Pesci outside of the \"Lethal Weapon series\".\n\nJoe Waters (Joe Pesci) and Gus Green (Danny Glover) are bumbling yet happy best friends who live modestly in Newark, New Jersey and have known each other since childhood. They share the hobby of fishing and win a stay in the Florida Everglades to go angling, but promise to return home in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nOn the way, however, while stopping at a restaurant, they meet an Englishman, Martin (Nick Brimble), who discreetly steals Joe's car keys and leaves. Joe and Gus are forced to push their boat down the road until they are met by two women, Rita (Rosanna Arquette) and Angie (Lynn Whitfield), who are after Martin and offer them a lift. During the ride, a bump causes the boat to disconnect from the car, leaving Joe and Gus stranded yet again, and the boat is accidentally hooked to a train and pulled away along with their beer and supplies. Joe and Gus hitch a ride with two men, but on the way, they see their car at a gas station and investigate. Joe goes to confront Martin inside the bathroom, but backs down when he catches Martin loading a gun. Joe and Gus flee the petrol station in their car, and discover a blood-stained knife in the dashboard.\n\nJoe and Gus stay at a trailer park for the night, and while watching a documentary on television, they learn that Martin is actually Dekker Massey, a wanted criminal who has conned several women out of their riches and is implied to have stabbed his last victim to death and hidden her money and jewelry somewhere. The presenters offer a bounty for Dekker's capture, and Joe and Gus decide to turn in the knife after their fishing trip. Meanwhile, Dekker begins hunting Joe and Gus down.\n\nFollowing a recommendation by the trailer park owner, Joe and Gus visit Phil Beasly's boatyard and rent a speedboat, but end up breaking almost every gadget on the boat, losing the knife and wrecking the boatyard by accident. Distraught, they decide to return home early, but end up with a flat tire. While getting the spare tire from the trunk, Joe discovers a map that leads to Dekker's fortune. They book a room in a nearby hotel, and while having dinner, they are found by Rita and Angie, who question them about Dekker and reveal that they are after him because Rita's mother was one of Dekker's victims. Joe and Gus promise to bring Dekker to justice, but that night, Gus sleepwalks and starts a fire in the hotel, destroying their suite and the map. They only barely manage to escape undetected, though their car breaks down on the road and Joe is struck by lightning while they try to fix it. Instead of killing him, the lightning boosts Joe's memory and he is able to lead the way to the cave where Dekker hid his fortune. Despite an altercation with an alligator, they retrieve the treasure and escape, but are accosted by Dekker. At gunpoint, Dekker forces them to push Joe's car into the swamp and ties them up inside a sheriff's office, intending to flee the country with the treasure.\n\nAfter Dekker leaves, however, Joe and Gus are found and freed by their idol, Billy \"Catch\" Pool (Willie Nelson), and they set out to stop Dekker. After a long chase across the swamp, Joe and Gus find and capture Dekker moments before his escape via plane and hand him over to the police. Though they claim the reward money, Joe and Gus are forced to spend it mostly on the damages they caused during their trip.\n\n\nWhen \"Gone Fishin\" was in the early stages of development during the early 1990s, the roles of Joe and Gus were first offered to John Candy and Rick Moranis. Both turned it down as they were busy with other projects. Once the film was given the greenlight in 1995, Joe Pesci and Danny Glover were eventually cast as the leads. John G. Avildsen was set to direct the movie and had already filmed it for the first two weeks, but he was fired from Disney and paid his $2 million salary to the studio, and Christopher Cain immediately signed on to replace him.\n\nDuring production of the film, stuntwoman Janet Wilder was killed when a boat that was made to jump a ramp in one of the scenes landed on top of her. Wilder's husband and father-in-law were also injured.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office behind \"\" and \"Addicted to Love\", earning around $5.8 million USD. The film eventually made around $19 million domestically, making it a box office bomb. Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a \"BOMB\" rating, his lowest rating. He called it \"an annoyingly unfunny gambit\" and declared that it was a waste of Pesci and Glover's talent, and \"this film really smells\". Film critic Chris Hicks of Salt Lake City said after \"Gone Fishin\"' and \"8 Heads in a Duffel Bag\" the Academy should have asked Pesci to return the Oscar he had won for \"Goodfellas\". The film currently holds a 4% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average score of 2.32/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Sloppy, formulaic, and unfunny, \"Gone Fishin\" marks a painful low point in the careers of its two talented leads.\"\n\nIn \"Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon\", Joe Queenan says that he was \"so embarrassed about Joe Pesci that he has been known to wait outside cinemas showing a film called \"Gone Fishin\"' and give those few customers who sat through it their money back, on behalf of the \"American Celluloid Retribution Society\".\n\nThe film also received two nominations at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards: Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Worst Actor for Pesci.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2301586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301586", "title": "Lyfe Jennings", "text": "Lyfe Jennings\n\nChester Jermaine \"Lyfe\" Jennings (born June 3, 1978) is an American R&B and soul singer-songwriter, record producer, and instrumentalist. He plays the guitar, bass, and piano which he integrates into his music. The New York Times referred to him as a \"socially minded R&B singer\".\n\nLyfe Jennings was born on June 3, 1978 in Toledo, Ohio to a working-class family and was the middle of five kids. As stated in \"Ghetto Superman\" and \"More Than A Girl\" from \"The Phoenix\", Lyfe lost his father at a young age. When he was a teenager, Lyfe Jennings started to perform with the group called \"The Dotsons\". \"The Dotsons\" consisted of himself, his brother, and two cousins. In the beginning of the 90s, however, the band disbanded. During this time, Lyfe began to get into legal trouble and his musical career came to a halt when he was sent to prison at then age of 14.\n\nIn 2002, after serving 10 years in prison, Lyfe returned to his musical aspirations. Two days after his December 2002 release from prison, he recorded a four-song demo CD.After a month post release, he performed at the Apollo. He was booed as he walked onto the stage, but when the Apollo audience heard his gritty falsetto and lyrical songwriting, they were swayed to the tune of five amateur-night victories in a row. Lyfe sold about 1,000 copies of his four-song demo CD during his Apollo \"residency.\" His growing success, influenced Lyfe to move to New York City and pursue a major-label deal. Columbia Records provided him with a contract and released his debut, Lyfe 268-192 in August 2004. A year after its original release, the album was reissued with a new version of \"Hypothetically\" added as bonus track featuring American Idol winner, Fantasia.\n\nLyfe released a more hip-hop-oriented follow-up \"The Phoenix\" arrived in August 2006, with Three 6 Mafia and Young Buck making guest appearances. Lyfe Change released in April 2008, featuring a handful of new production associates as well as a verse from T.I. Jennings. Subsequently, Lyfe accepted a new deal with Warner Bros. and began working on another album, tentatively titled Sooner or Later, which he stated would be his last. The album was finally released in August 2010 and featured guest spots from Bryan-Michael Cox, Warryn Campbell, Fabolous, Bobby Valentino, Ludacris, Anthony Hamilton, and Jazmine Sullivan. Lyfe completed another prison stint for his actions stemming from a 2008 domestic dispute.\n\nHe returned to music in October 2013 with \"Lucid\", released on the Mass Appeal label. Like all of his previous studio releases, it peaked in the Top 10 of Billboard's R&B chart. Tree of Lyfe, recorded primarily in his home studio, followed in June 2015. On his new album, \"Tree of Lyfe\", Lyfe Jennings describes it as his most personal work to date and produced the majority of the album at his home studio in Greenwood, Mississippi . When asked about his current musical mindset, Lyfe Jennings response is one of reflection and experience, \"Everybody feels like they have to reinvent themselves. I don’t think you can reinvent the truth. It is what it is. I’m not focused on reinvention. I want to go deeper. This album reaffirms the reasons why people started loving this music in the first place.\"\n\nThe numbers \"268-192\" attached to the end of his debut album represent the identification number he was given while incarcerated. Then Lyfe appeared on \"Showtime at the Apollo\".\n\nWith his former-manager and ex fiancé, Associate Producer Joy Bounds Jennings has two sons, Phoenix Roy Jennings (2005) and Elijah Jennings (2006).\n\nHe has a daughter Liyah Jennings (born October 2008) with ex-girlfriend early childhood educator Anita Priestley.\n\nJennings has a son with Marquita, Lyfe Michael Jennings, born February 2011.\n\nHis youngest son, Knoah Mendoza born January 2016, with ex-girlfriend, model India Mendoza.\n\nJennings has two more children, both born days apart in April 2018.\n\nAccording to the Marietta Daily Journal, in October 2008 after arguing with Joy Bounds, he followed her to her family's house in Smyrna, Georgia. At the residence, he destroyed the door, fired shots in the street, and then led police on a 90 mph chase that ended when he crashed his 2005 Corvette. In September 2010 he was sentenced to three and a half years after he pleaded guilty to multiple charges arising from the incident.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301592", "title": "USS Saratoga (1814)", "text": "USS Saratoga (1814)\n\nUSS \"Saratoga\" was a corvette built in Vergennes, Vermont, for service on Lake Champlain in the War of 1812. She was named for the Battles of Saratoga. \n\n\"Saratoga\" was laid down on 7 March 1814, launched on 11 April 1814 and she was christened April 6, the day that Napoleon abdicated. She was a Corvette weighing 734 tons, 143' long with a beam of 36'6\" and a depth of hold 12'6\". She had a complement of 212 with an armament of eight long 24-pounders, six 42-pounder carronades and twelve 32-pounder carronades. The \"Saratoga\" began her service on Lake Champlain as England was turning her attention and resources from the European continent to North America. British strategy envisaged a series of amphibious raids along the American coast as a diversion to cover a lethal thrust south from Canada down the strategic and already historic Lake Champlain-Hudson River corridor.\n\nHowever, the completion of \"Saratoga\" put the United States ahead in the naval construction race on Lake Champlain; and Sir George Prévost, the Governor General of Canada and top British military commander in America, felt that supremacy afloat was a prerequisite to a successful invasion of the United States through the state of New York. He, therefore, delayed the start of his campaign until new naval construction had tipped the balance back in his favor.\n\nMeanwhile, Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough, commander of American naval forces on the lake, took advantage of the edge which \"Saratoga\" had given him and sailed to the mouth of the Richelieu River. He proceeded to blockade the Richelieu for most of the following summer. Up the river at Ile aux Noix, the little British fleet, protected by shore batteries and by the river's narrow and tricky channel, waited while English shipwrights worked feverishly to complete . The British launched the \"Confiance\" on 25 August 1814. She was a 36-gun frigate hastily fitted out for battle and the largest warship ever to sail on Lake Champlain.\n\nMaster Commandant Macdonough, commanding officer of \"Saratoga\" as well as of the other American forces on the lake, had sailed back south. He had proceeded around Cumberland Head, New York; and entered Plattsburgh Bay. There, he deployed his ships across the mouth of the harbor in a strong defensive position where when the British fleet would attack them, they would be at a disadvantage of having to slowly and laboriously approach the line of American broadsides, against the wind and unable to bring most of their guns to bear.\n\nAs Master Commandant MacDonough awaited the arrival of the enemy, he dropped kedge anchors and arranged spring lines, which afforded his ships maximum maneuverability. He then had the crews practice turning their ships so that alternately starboard and port guns would face south.\n\nDuring the construction race, crack British troops — veterans hardened in Wellington's bloody Peninsular Campaign — had been rushed from Spain to the St. Lawrence for the impending offensive. Before the end of August, the British Army had begun to march south along the western shore of Lake Champlain. Badly outnumbered, American ground forces withdrew before the English advance, crossed the Saranac River, and took prepared positions on the bluffs which overlook Plattsburgh Bay. On the morning of 11 September, when Commodore George Downie led the British squadron around Cumberland Head, Macdonough was ready. As British brig, \"Linnet\", approached firing range, she opened the action with a salvo toward \"Saratoga\". All but one of the projectiles fell short; and that solid shot was all but spent as it landed on the American corvette, bounced across her deck, and smashed a wooden poultry cage freeing a gamecock. The indignant rooster took to his wings and landed in the rigging. Facing the British warships, the cock defiantly called out challenge to battle.\n\nMacdonough, himself, aimed a long 24-pounder at the bow of \"Confiance\", pulled the lanyard firing \"Saratoga\"s first round, and gave the signal, \"close action.\" The shot cut the British flagship's anchor cable, ripped up her deck, and smashed her helm. Then, all the American ships opened fire.\n\n\"Confiance\"s first broadside struck \"Saratoga\" from point blank range, and the American flagship reeled from the blow. Half of her men were felled by the shock; but most of the sailors picked themselves up, carried their dead and wounded comrades below, and returned to the fray. Since \"Confiance\"s green gunners failed to reset the elevation of their barrels, each of her subsequent volleys tended to be higher than its predecessor and, while shredding \"Saratoga\"s rigging, did little structural damage to the ship.\n\nAfter almost two hours' fighting, \"Saratoga\"s last serviceable starboard gun, a carronade, broke loose from its carriage and hurtled down the main hatch. Macdonough then dropped a stern anchor; cut his bow cable; and, with the help of tars hauling on lines to kedge anchors, swung the ship around bringing her fresh, port, broadside guns to bear on the enemy.\n\nThe badly battered British flagship, with Downie and her first lieutenant dead, also attempted to wind ship but was unable to do so. Helpless to do further harm to her adversary, \"Confiance\" struck her colors.\n\nThen, by pulling on her starboard kedge line, \"Saratoga\"s sailors turned the corvette's guns toward \"Linnet\" and opened fire. The British brig, although severely damaged and unable to move, gallantly kept up the fight for about an hour before surrendering. At that time, \"Finch\" and \"Chub\", the other two relatively large warships in the British squadron, were already in American hands; so the surviving English gunboats fled toward Canada.\n\nMacdonough's victory in Plattsburgh Bay left the United States unchallenged on Lake Champlain and forced Prevost to retreat to Canada. This weakened the British position in negotiations at Ghent and enabled American commissioners to secure a favorable rather than a humiliating peace. It also helped to restore American morale after the recent burning of Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter the war, \"Saratoga\" was laid up until sold at Whitehall, New York, in 1825.\n\nSaratoga Passage, a body of water in Puget Sound, was named after the ship.\n"}

{"id": "2301603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301603", "title": "Into the Groove", "text": "Into the Groove\n\n\"Into the Groove\" is a song recorded by American singer Madonna for the 1985 film \"Desperately Seeking Susan\". It was featured on the re-issue of her second studio album, \"Like a Virgin\" (1984), outside North America. Sire Records released it on July 15, 1985, as the album's fourth single. Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man, across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it as the soundtrack of the film \"Desperately Seeking Susan\".\n\n\"Into the Groove\" consists of instrumentation from synthesizers and drum machines. Madonna's voice is double tracked in the chorus; the song also consists of musical contrasts, overdubs, and Madonna's voice in lower register during the bridge. The lyrics of the song are simple, written as an invitation to dance with the singer. However, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. The song received positive response from music critics, and was a commercial success. \"Into the Groove\" topped the record charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, and became her first number-one song in the United Kingdom. The track was only available as the B-side of the 12-inch single of \"Angel\" in the United States, therefore it was ineligible to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at the time.\n\nA music video, consisting of clips from the film, was released to accompany the song. The song has been performed by Madonna in most of her concert tours, most recently on the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015–2016. \"Into the Groove\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Australian singer Dannii Minogue, who combined the song with her single \"Don't Wanna Lose This Feeling\". By the end of the 1980s, \"Into the Groove\" was honored by \"Billboard\" magazine as the Dance Single of the Decade.\n\n\"Into the Groove\" was written and produced by Madonna and her then-boyfriend Stephen Bray. The singer had initially written the song for her friend Mark Kamins' protégée, Chyne, and recorded a demo which Kamins intended to modify later. However, Madonna believed that the song would be more suitable for her film \"Desperately Seeking Susan\", and recorded it with Bray for the film's soundtrack. When Kamins found out he was furious that Madonna did not inform him that she would use the song for the film. The singer retorted: \"I'm tough, I'm ambitious and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, that's okay.\" \"Into the Groove\" ultimately did not appear on the soundtrack album of the film, but was released on the 1985 worldwide re-issue of Madonna's second studio album, \"Like a Virgin\". During an interview with \"Time\", Madonna said that she wrote the song while watching a Latin boy across her balcony. Describing the song as \"dorky\", Madonna further explained:\n\"Into the Groove\" had an accompanying music video, made up of clips from the film, with the lyrics often matching the images. Doug Dowdle of Parallax Productions, a company that pioneered in movie tie-in music videos during the 1980s, created this video from edited footage of the movie, directed by Susan Seidelman. This was done because there were five Madonna videos already on power rotation on MTV, and Warner Bros. did not want the audience to be saturated with any new video. Hence, they decided to use the shots from the film and made a music video. During a 2009 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Madonna commented: \"'Into the Groove' is another song I feel retarded singing, but everybody seems to like it.\"\n\nMadonna and Bray started on the re-recording and changed some portion of the lyrics. Bray commented on the recording sessions as: \"I've always kind of made the rib cage and the skeleton [music] of the song already – she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut [lyrics]. She writes in a stream of mood really.\" \"Into the Groove\" was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's \"Madonna\" biography, she noted that at one point of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing with the rest of the composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up to the microphone and sang the words \"Live out your fantasy here with me\". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: \"[The song] seemed to come out of her, I was awestruck.\"\n\nMadonna re-tailored the song in 2003, and developed a remix called \"Into the Hollywood Groove\", which replaced the first verse of \"Into the Groove\" with the first verse of Madonna's single \"Hollywood\" (2003). The lyrics of the chorus were also slightly altered and it featured a rap by Missy Elliott. This version of the song was used for a Gap commercial in the summer of 2003, featuring Madonna and Elliot wearing Gap jeans. Another remix version was created by Josh Harris and Omar Galeano as \"The Passengerz\", and was included in Madonna's remix album, \"Remixed & Revisited\" (2003).\n\nA dance-pop song, \"Into the Groove\" begins with a spoken introduction by Madonna, and the sound of drums and synth bassline being heard. This is followed by the chorus, where Madonna's voice is double tracked and the treble is increased by a notch. A synth line counterpoints the main tune, adding a contrast. The bridge, where Madonna sings the line \"Live out your fantasy\", features her vocals in a lower register alongside the main ones. According to the sheet music published in Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing Co. Inc., the song is set in the time signature of common time with a medium tempo of 116 beats per minute. The song is set in the key of C minor with Madonna's voice spanning from the low-tone of C to the high-tone of D. It has a basic sequence of Cm7–B/C–Cm7–A as its chord progression.\n\nThe song was remixed by Shep Pettibone for Madonna's remix compilation \"You Can Dance\" (1987). In the remixed version, overdubs are present with the continuous repetition of the phrase \"c'mon\". The first verse does not start until about ninety seconds into the remix. After the first \"Now I know you're mine\" line is sung, there is a percussion break, and repetition of the phrases \"step to the beat\" and \"c'mon\". The last verse incorporates echoing on the vocals, causing overlap of the phrases. The remix ends with instrumentation from congas, whistles and timbales, giving it a Mexican ending. Pettibone also remixed the song alongside Goh Hotoda for \"The Immaculate Collection\" (1990) compilation.\n\nThe lyrics of the song are simple, written as an invitation to dance with the singer. Despite the simple lyrics, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. Similar to Madonna's previous single \"Like a Virgin\" (1984), a lyrical hook is also present in \"Into the Groove\", directed at shy girls. The line \"At night I lock the door so no-one else can see\" implied that Madonna was not as brazen as her provocative image suggested. According to Barker, the nostalgic people would instantly recognize the song's lyrics at night clubs. He added that the line, \"Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free,\" expresses the freedom that a dance floor brings about, with the dancers happy to find freedom in the music. A neume is visible in the line \"Live out your fantasy here with me\", which Barker believed, blurred the boundaries of reality and brought one closer to the world of fantasy.\n\nEver since its release, \"Into the Groove\" has received critical acclaim. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of \"\", said that the song demonstrated Madonna's ability to create infectious dance music. Rikky Rooksby, author of \"Madonna: the complete guide to her music\", said that \"'Into the Groove' will make you feel like you're a winner either way. And that's one of the best things pop music can do for ya. [It's] Madonna's first great single.\" Clive Barker and Simon Trussler, authors of \"New Theatre Quarterly\", felt that the song was the first disco-anthem of the 1980s.\n\nToby Cresswell, author of \"1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets\", said that the song is a \"sweet, limited white tune on the top, and there's Madonna – all the right-shop chic – dragging the straight world into this subterranean paradise. All the magic of the eighties is right here.\" Matthew Rettenmund, author of \"Totally Awesome 80s: A Lexicon of the Music, Videos, Movies, TV Shows, Stars, and Trends of that Decadent Decade\", declared \"Into the Groove\" as the ultimate 1980s song and felt that it \"cemented Madonna's place as the dancing queen of the era\". Dawn Keetley and John Pettigrew, authors of \"Public Women, Public Words: A Documentary History of American Feminism\", called it a \"mesmerizing theme song\".\n\nSantiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of \"Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations\", commented that the song \"taunted playfully\". Sal Cinquemani from \"Slant Magazine\" ranked it at twenty-nine on the list of \"100 Greatest Dance Songs\". He commented: \"It's hard to imagine the most famous woman in the world dancing alone in her bedroom at night, locking the doors so 'no one else can see' (as she sings on 'Groove'), even 20 years ago, but you can't help but believe her. The song—and Madonna's performance—are that good.\" Alfred Soto from \"Stylus\" commented that \"'Into the Groove' itself is as much wish-fulfillment as 'Crazy For You'. Austin Scaggs from \"Rolling Stone\" commented that the song had \"an amazing bassline\".\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, \"Into the Groove\" was honored by \"Billboard\" magazine as the \"Dance Single of the Decade\". In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their top-twenty Madonna singles of all-time by \"Q\" magazine; \"Into the Groove\" was allocated the number-three spot. In 2009, the song was ranked at ninety on \"Blender\" magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". \"Billboard\" ranked the song number three on a 2015 list of Madonna's top 15 best songs, calling it \"\"the\" Madonna club track.\" In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation's 19th favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV. Pitchfork Media named \"Into the Groove\" the 17th best song from the 1980s.\n\nIn the United States, due to similar problems with \"Crazy for You\" and \"Material Girl\" being released at the same time and competing with each other, it was decided against releasing \"Into the Groove\" as a 7\" single so it would not compete with \"Angel\", the third single from the \"Like a Virgin\". \"Into the Groove\" was eventually released as the B-side to the maxi-single of \"Angel\", therefore it was ineligible to enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 or Hot Singles Sales charts. The song debuted at number 40 on Hot Dance Club Songs chart, as a double A-side with \"Angel\", on the issue dated June 1, 1985. After four weeks, it reached the top of the chart and also reached number 19 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Into the Groove\" is Madonna's most played song on \"Billboard\"s Recurrent Airplay Chart. On July 30, 1985, \"Angel/Into the Groove\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of one million copies across the US—the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989. It was the first 12-inch single to be certified gold since Frankie Smith's \"Double Dutch Bus\" (1981). The song placed at number 12 on the Dance year-end charts and sold approximately 600,000 copies of the 12\"; it also reached number-one on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart.\n\n\"Into the Groove\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number four, on the chart dated July 27, 1985, becoming the highest debuting single for any female artist in the history of the chart at that time. It reached the top of the chart and stayed there for four weeks, and was present for a total of 14 weeks on the chart. The song was Madonna's first number-one single in United Kingdom. During its stay at number-one, Madonna's first UK hit \"Holiday\" was at number-two position. This made her the first female artist in UK chart history to hold the top-two positions of the chart simultaneously. \"Into the Groove\" was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 500,000 copies of the single. It has sold 957,000 copies there as of August 2018, and is Madonna's biggest selling song in the country. The song was the third biggest selling UK single of 1985, behind Jennifer Rush's \"The Power of Love\" and Elaine Paige's and Barbara Dickson's \"I Know Him So Well\". In Australia, \"Into the Groove\" charted as a combined single with \"Angel\" and reached the top of the Kent Music Report chart. It was the second-highest selling single of 1985 in Australia. Across Europe, Oceania and Africa, the song was able to reach the top of the charts in Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain, and inside the top five in France, Germany, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and European Hot 100 Singles chart. According to \"Music & Media\" magazine the song had sold around 1.5 million copies by September 1985.\n\n\"Into the Groove\" was performed as the third song during The Virgin Tour in 1985. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. Her hair was tied at the top and fell in unkempt manner around her ears. She had a tambourine in her hand like her two male dancers, and together they sang the song while standing in front of a microphone, in tandem. The performance was included on the video release titled \"\", shot in Detroit. She also performed it on her Live Aid concert on July 13, 1985.\n\nIn the Who's That Girl World Tour of 1987, \"Into the Groove\" was the second-to-last song before the encore. The outfit she wore during the performance was inspired by artist Andy Warhol. It consisted of a loose pant with a tin of Campbell's soup on the side, the letter U in the front and the word DANCE in the back; it was designed so that when she turned, audience were able to read 'U [Can] Dance]'. In the middle of her singing, a young boy joined her on stage to dance alongside. Madonna then wore a pink bolero jacket. At the end she is joined by her backup singers and dancers. Together they take a bow to the audience and finish the performance. Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: \"Who's That Girl – Live in Japan\", filmed in Tokyo on June 22, 1987, and \"\", filmed in Turin on September 4, 1987.\nThree years later on the Blond Ambition World Tour, \"Into the Groove\" was again performed before the encore. Madonna, her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory were portrayed as being seduced by three macho guys in leather jackets. The girls asked the guys to \"prove their love to them\" and wondered if they would wear a condom when necessary. After that, they sing the Shep Pettibone extended remix of \"Into The Groove\". Two different performances were taped and released on video, the \"Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90\", taped in Yokohama on April 27, 1990, and the \"Blond Ambition World Tour Live\", taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. In the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, Madonna included the song at the start of the final segment, which started with Scottish bagpiper players parading around the stage in kilts and playing drums and pipes. Madonna appeared onstage in similar long kilts and a white sleeveless T-shirt to perform \"Into the Groove\" with Scottish bagpiper group Lorne Cousin. Rapper Missy Elliott appeared on the video screen for a rap interlude.\n\nThe song was again added to the setlist of 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Elements of Cassius's \"Toop Toop\", Frankie Smith's \"Double Dutch Bus\", The Sugarhill Gang's \"\" and Madonna's own \"Jump\" were added to the performance. \"Into the Groove\" marked the beginning of the second segment titled Old School. It began with Madonna appearing on the stage in shorts and T-shirt, while skipping to a DJ station. She started singing the song while cartoon characters from late artist, and Madonna's friend, Keith Haring dance on the backdrops. Near the end of the song, Madonna performed a Double Dutch dance interlude. In 2015, \"Into the Groove\" was included in the set list of the Rebel Heart Tour, performed in a flamenco-style medley with \"Dress You Up\", \"Everybody\" and \"Lucky Star\". During the sequence the singer dressed by in a Latin and gypsy inspired dress, created by Alessandro Michele for Gucci consisting off a shawl, flamenco hat, lace, skirts and jacquard bodysuit.\n\nThe song was covered by alternative rock band Sonic Youth under the pseudonym Ciccone Youth for a 1986 single, and re-titled \"Into the Groove(y)\"; this recording also appears on the 1988 release \"The Whitey Album\". Dale Bozzio, former lead singer of new wave band Missing Persons, covered the song for the Madonna tribute album \"Virgin Voices: A Tribute To Madonna, Vol. 2\" from 2000. Alternative pop singer Jeremy Jay covered the song in 2007; it was also included on \"Through the Wilderness\", a psychedelic-folk tribute album to Madonna. French pop/rock group Superbus covered \"Into the Groove\" for their 2002 album, \"Aéromusical\". It was the third and final single from the album.\n\nIn 2003, the song was combined with the vocals of Dannii Minogue's \"Don't Wanna Lose This Feeling\", the fourth and final single from her album \"Neon Nights\". \"Into the Groove\"'s instrumentation and a small Madonna vocal sample were added to Minogue's vocals, though Minogue's pitch was altered to fit the tempo of the song.\nIn 1985 and 2017, Hong Kong singer Anita Mui and Priscilla Chan covered this song in Cantonese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Like a Virgin\" (1985 re-issue) and \"You Can Dance\" album's liner notes.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301629", "title": "Adolph Kiefer", "text": "Adolph Kiefer\n\nAdolph Gustav Kiefer (June 27, 1918 – May 5, 2017) was an American competition swimmer, Olympic competitor, the last surviving gold medalist of the 1936 Summer Olympics and former world record-holder. He was the first man in the world to swim the 100-yard backstroke in under one minute. Kiefer was also an inventor and innovator of new products related to aquatics competition.\n\nKiefer was born as a son of German immigrants in Chicago, Illinois, and there attended Roosevelt High School (1936). He then attended the University of Texas at Austin (1939), and Columbia College, Columbia University (1940).\n\nKiefer became the first man to break the one-minute mark in the 100-yard backstroke while competing as a 16-year-old in the Illinois High School Championships of 1935, swimming 59.8 seconds. His 1936 Illinois state championship backstroke time of 58.5 seconds was the Illinois state high-school record until 1960. On April 6, 1940, Kiefer set another world record, swimming the 100-yard backstroke in 57.9 seconds. He broke twenty-three records after breaking the one-minute backstroke mark. Kiefer set a world record for the 100-meter backstroke of 1:04.8 on January 18, 1936, at Brennan Pools in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nEighteen-year-old Kiefer represented the United States at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. On August 14, Kiefer won the gold medal in the men's 100-meter backstroke. He set new Olympic records in the first-round heats (1:06.9), the second-round heats (1:06.8), and the event final (1:05.9). His Olympic Record would stand for over 20 years, finally broken by David Theile in the 1956 Summer Olympics.\n\nKiefer returned home a national hero, and began traveling with other U.S. Olympic medalists on a tour of Europe, China, Japan, and South America, during which he challenged other great swimmers in those locations to individual races.\n\nIn over 2,000 races, Kiefer lost only twice. At the National AAU swimming championship in April 1943, University of Michigan All-American swimmer Harry Holiday, Jr. finally went head-to-head with world-record holder Kiefer. Holiday beat him in the 150-yard backstroke at the AAU meet. The defeat was the first for Kiefer in eight years.\n\nIn his first two months of varsity competition, Holiday broke two of Kiefer's world records, lowering the 100-yard backstroke mark to 57 seconds and the 200-meter standard to 2:22.9. In August 1943, the NCAA also recognized Holiday as the holder of the new world record in the 150-yard backstroke with a mark of 1:31.5. Shortly thereafter, Kiefer was asked to audition for the role of \"Tarzan\", but answered the call of arms instead, joining the U.S. Navy.\n\nKiefer joined the U.S. Navy as a Chief Petty Officer in late 1943 and was initially assigned to the physical fitness and swimming division of the United States Navy's Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) as a Chief Athletics Specialist. When the Navy realized that it was losing more lives to drowning than to enemy bullets, Kiefer was appointed to a committee to set new guidelines for safety and training. He quickly moved through the ranks, becoming Officer in Charge of Swimming for the entire U.S. Navy, training over 13,000 navy swim instructors to do the \"Victory backstroke\", a term Kiefer coined himself. Victory backstroke was a simplified version of the modern backstroke that allowed novice swimmers to breathe easily (on their backs) while leveraging what Adolph considered to be a more buoyant stroke style for novice swimmers. Victory backstroke was performed with both arms underwater, sweeping down simultaneously (instead of using alternating arms), while using a freestyle kick. The American Red Cross would later add Victory Backstroke to their swim training protocols.\n\nBy the war's end, he had reached the rank of Lieutenant, Senior Grade.\n\nIn 1947, he established Adolph Kiefer & Associates, Inc. in Chicago, which has provided swimmers with training, safety, and competition equipment. His company was responsible for the development of the nylon tank suit in 1948. and debuted the first nylon swimsuit supplied to the U.S. Olympic Swim Team—a marked improvement over the wool and cotton suits available at the time.\n\nKiefer subsequently devoted himself to community service, combining swimming and philanthropy in innovative ways. In the 1960s he worked with Mayor Richard J. Daley to build swimming-pools across the inner city of Chicago, providing the facilities needed for thousands of children to learn to swim. Kiefer actively supported Swim Across America, a nonprofit organization that raises funds for cancer research, and participated in SAA public swimming events well into his 70s and 80s.\n\nKiefer was an \"Honor Swimmer\" member of the inaugural class inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1965. In 1966 he patented the first design for a no-wave, non-turbulence racing lane.\n\nIn 2008 Kiefer celebrated his 90th birthday in Omaha at the 2008 U.S. Swimming Olympic Trials, where he awarded medals for the 200-meter backstroke. On June 27, 2012, he celebrated his birthday again in Omaha at the 2012 U.S. Swimming Olympic Trials—by awarding the medals for the 200-meter backstroke. In 2013 USA Swimming named Kiefer the \"father of American swimming\" in recognition of his contributions to American swimming.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, 2017, Kiefer died at home in Wadsworth, Illinois, at the age of 98.\n\n\n"}

Tad is portrayed by Michael E. Knight, and Dixie is portrayed by Cady McClain. On Internet message boards, the couple is often referred to as \"T&D\" or \"TnD\" (for Tad and Dixie).\n\nThe pairing became one of the most prominent soap opera couples in American daytime history. Their union was studied and featured within books, held up as an ideal paradigm for other fictional pairings, and praised as one of the greatest love stories ever told.\n\nIn early 2007, controversy abounded when former \"All My Children\" head writer Megan McTavish made the decision to kill off one half of the pair — Dixie. Viewers protested against the writers and the ABC television network, demanding that they find a way to undo Dixie's death. However, the character's demise was deemed permanent. The incident was elevated as one of the most prominent controversies in American daytime television history. To appease fans and make an effort to amend the situation, ABC Daytime executives and McClain confirmed in March 2008 that Dixie would be returning to the series but in the form of a ghost and for a brief time period. McClain's first airdate was May 2, 2008. In April 2011, it was announced that she would be returning to the serial before its September 23, 2011 network ending. Dixie is seen returning on the May 17, 2011 episode, where she is shown to be alive and held captive in an undisclosed location by David Hayward, later managing to escape.\n\nSoon after her arrival in Pine Valley, Dixie falls under the influence of Adam Chandler, the archenemy of her Uncle Palmer. Although Adam and Brooke English are happily married at the time, Adam realizes that Brooke cannot give him the one thing that he wants most in the world — a son. Adam has a brief affair with Dixie, and she becomes pregnant. He suggests to Brooke that they adopt Dixie's baby and she agrees, but she has one small problem — she wonders who the father is. Brooke hires Tad Martin to find out who fathered Dixie's baby, and Tad and Dixie become friends. They talk, laugh, eat chicken fingers and become very close. However, their bond is shattered when Dixie realizes that Tad is only interested in her to find out information for Brooke. She decides to try to make it work with Adam, but deep down she knows that Tad has found his way into her heart. \n\nDixie marries Adam, not knowing that he is only interested in gaining full custody of their child. Tad persists in warning Dixie about Adam's true intentions, but she simply will not listen. \"I'm his wife, Tad, of course he loves me!\" is what Dixie often replies whenever Tad suggests that Adam is only after the baby. Despite Dixie's stubbornness and refusal to face the truth, Tad persists in warning his beloved, and his insistence gets him beaten up by Adam's thugs. Dixie nurses her best friend back to health, and the two once again feel the closeness they shared at the beginning of their friendship. On the day Adam Jr. (later known as JR) is born, Tad reveals to Dixie that he wants more than friendship from her. He has fallen in love with the girl from Pigeon Hollow and finally admits his true feelings. Although it is obvious (to the audience) that Dixie loves Tad as well, she decides to stay with Adam and tells Tad that they cannot be friends or see each other anymore.\n\nStaying away from each other proves to be very painful and difficult for Tad and Dixie, especially considering that Pine Valley is a small town. Try as she may, Dixie is unable to stay away from Tad and when JR is kidnapped, Dixie immediately calls Tad. While everyone thinks that Skye Chandler is the kidnapper, Tad manages to prove that the baby snatcher was really a woman named Karen.\n\nDetermined to get sole custody of JR, Adam comes up with a very elaborate and sadistic plot to make Dixie think that she is losing her mind. In time, Adam's plan works and he sends Dixie to a sanitarium. Adam looks forward to raising his son and winning back Brooke, but has not counted on the fact that Tad will stop at nothing to get Dixie out of the mental institution. With characters Cecily and Nico's help, Tad manages to free his beloved from the clutches of Adam and his accomplice, Dr. Snow. While on the run from Adam, Dixie finally admits her true feelings to Tad; she does not love Adam, it is him she loves.\n\nEven though they manage to prove that Dixie is sane, she still loses custody of JR, and Adam offers her generous visiting privileges if she agrees to a quick divorce, which she does. Finally freed from Adam, Dixie falls into Tad's arms and he proposes to her wearing a bright yellow chicken suit. Dixie happily accepts, and the two make plans to wed. Their happiness is further cemented when Dixie regains custody of her son, and Palmer gets the best of Adam in a business deal. Tad and Dixie finally marry in late December 1989.\n\nThe couple divorces, however, just months later in May 1990 after Tad's mother, Opal, and Palmer interfere. They soon grow close again, but their plans to remarry are spoiled after Tad is presumed dead following an explosion. Nearly three years later, in late 1992, it is revealed that Tad had survived the explosion and has been living in California under a different name. He and Dixie reconcile, and in 1994, they remarry. With Tad's help, she finally regains custody of Adam Jr.\n\nTheir second marriage, lasts about 2 years until JR (then 8 years old) catches Tad having an affair. Dixie divorces Tad, takes JR and moves to Pigeon Hollow, West Virginia. But she returns to Pine Valley in 1998 when Adam Chandler demands to see his son. She and Tad began dating again, and in 1999, they marry a third time.\n\nBy late 2001, their marriage has collapsed. In January 2002, Dixie leaves Tad and JR, off to the Caribbean, where she gets a divorce from Tad. Dixie regrets this decision, however, and returns to Pine Valley to try and reconcile with Tad. She and Tad make up, but Dixie learns that she is pregnant with a baby girl and flees to Switzerland to give birth to the child in secret. When Dixie is in her third trimester, she writes Tad a letter, telling him that she is pregnant and wants to come back to him. However, on May 10, 2002, while driving back from Geneva to Bern, she is in involved in a horrible car crash and is presumed dead. Tad and JR mourn, but eventually move on with their lives.\n\nDixie is still mentioned, and there is a time where a woman named Di Kirby claims to be the \"back from the dead\" Dixie. It is later revealed that she is rather Dixie's half-sister.\n\nOn December 23, 2005, it is shown (to the audience) that Dixie did indeed survive the automobile accident that was thought to have claimed her life while she was in Europe. Di, the only one who knows that Dixie is alive, goes to visit her, and urges her to return to Pine Valley and let her family know that she is alive. Dixie seems adamant on not taking Di's advice at first, but soon returns to Pine Valley in February 2006. She attends the Mardi Gras ball thrown by Erica Kane. Because her face is hidden by a mask, no one from her family recognizes her. She does, however, witness a tender moment between Tad and Di, as well as JR and Babe. Janet Dillon rigs the hot water heater at the mansion where the ball is being held so that it will explode. When it does, many people die and are injured and Dixie is trapped by some rubble. She manages to escape without being discovered by anyone. She goes to Wildwind, where Di is staying. In the middle of confronting her sister, Tad arrives and Dixie runs off before he can see her. Later, she runs into Zach Slater, and he promises not to reveal the fact that she is still alive. Later, she secretly watches in horror as her son holds a gun to Krystal Carey at a cabin, demanding to know where his ex-wife, Babe, has taken their son. Dixie hides as Tad arrives and tries to wrestle the gun away from JR, but the gun goes off and hits Dixie (who is outside) in the arm. It is soon revealed that Tad and Dixie's baby, Kate, is in fact alive, but was taken by Dr. Greg Madden, a famous surgeon who is hated by virtually everyone in Pine Valley. A few months earlier, Tad had informed Erica that Greg stole her baby, the one she aborted twenty-something years ago, and Erica's son is also alive, going by the name Josh Madden.\n\nOn April 14, 2006, Tad and Dixie finally come face to face since her presumed death. Tad looks at Dixie with an astonished expression and leaves with her, resulting in him punching Dr. David Hayward, who was and is determined to keep Tad from Dixie. Tad first thinks that David's obsession with Dixie has led him to have plastic surgery performed on someone, but once Dixie says the words \"Ozzie and Harriet\", he knows that this woman is his true love.\n\nTad is furious, however, that Dixie let him and JR think that she was dead for four years without a word. He grows even angrier when he learns that she gave away Kate after letting Greg Madden convince her that Tad could not love a daughter, who, Madden claimed, would remind him of Dixie's death too much for him to love the child properly. Tad vents his anger while testifying at Dixie's trial when she stands accused of Greg Madden's murder. Afterwards, though, the two begin to reconcile. Tad invites her for a date one morning, and Dixie accepts. However, in 2007, she dies that day after eating poisoned pancakes that were meant for her daughter-in-law (Babe). Babe's attempted murderer is known as the Satin Slayer, a serial killer killing off the women of Fusion Cosmetics. Dixie's ghost/spirit later sees Tad playing with a little 4-year-old named Kathy and instinctively knows that the little girl is actually their lost daughter — Kate. At first, no one else in Pine Valley knows this but Dixie. Adam, however, later discovers the child alive and keeps the knowledge to himself. He is conflicted on a number of occasions on whether to tell Tad, but ultimately decides against it when he finds out that Tad has married the woman he loves, Krystal Carey.\n\nIn May 2008, Dixie's spirit returns to Pine Valley. On a mission to reunite Tad with his daughter, she haunts Adam, telling him that she will only stop if he tells Tad where Kate is. Adam constantly refuses, but finally relents once Tad is shot by a deranged Rob Gardner at Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter's wedding, where celebration has just ended. As Tad experiences the life he could have had with Dixie while lying in Pine Valley hospital hanging between life and death, Adam calls out to him. At Tad's bedside, he tries to reach Tad through the unconscious. Dixie hears Adam calling Tad and smiles, still in Tad's embrace. Tad and Dixie say once last goodbye, after one last kiss, and part hands. Tad goes back to the land of the living to be a father to Kate.\n\nOn May 17, 2011, despite her ghostly appearances, Dixie is revealed to be alive and being held under observation in a locked cell by David. It later turns out she is one of the patients in David's medical experiment called Project Orpheus. Dixie manages to escape, still disoriented and weak from the drugs David has given her. She comes to Pine Valley, where her daughter Kathy and son JR see her, but think that they're hallucinating. Eventually, officer Brot Monroe finds her and takes her to Oak Haven.\n\nAt Oak Haven, she runs into Erica, who has recently been admitted. Erica helps Dixie get out, along with Annie Lavery, Marian Colby, and Janet Dillon. Marian, Erica, and Dixie make their way to Erica's daughter, Kendall's house. When Kendall brings up David's name, Dixie runs away in fright. She still hasn't gained back her senses yet.\n\nDixie makes her way to the park and finds Tad, who is talking to her through the stars. On August 8, 2011, Tad asks for a sign from Dixie, and she calls out his name. At first, Tad thinks he's imagining it. Then, Dixie calls out again. Tad turns around and sees Dixie, and they finally reunite. As they spend time under the stars that night, Dixie slowly regains her senses and strength again in Tad's presence.\n\nTad takes Dixie home the next morning, where she meets their daughter, Kathy, face-to-face for the first time.\n\nTad and Dixie's romance has been featured, alluded to and studied in several books, and is considered a timeless, classic romance. Reasons for the couple's success were analyzed by soap opera magazine \"Soap Opera Digest\": \"The thing that made Tad and Dixie so magical was their sparkling humor, and Michael E. Knight's and Cady McClain's ability to express it brilliantly.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated, \"Soulmates Tad (Michael E. Knight) and Dixie (Cady McClain) set the soap world on fire with their straightforward, often hilarious interactions as they fought ex-husbands, ex-wives, and countless others to be with each other.\"\n\nIn 2004, writers Robert Parkin and Linda Stone published the book \"Kinship and Family: An Anthropological Reader\", a representative collection tracing the history of the anthropological study of kinship from the early 1900s to the present day. In their study, one of the topics Parkin and Stone analyzed was how in today's soap opera medium, a family consisting of a husband and wife living with their biological children is now \"exceedingly rare\" and it is not something that is expected anymore on daytime dramas to create the \"ideal\" family. In their chapter \"Kinship In The American Soap Opera\", Parkin and Stone presented the Tad and Dixie marriage as the prime example. Studied was how JR (biological son of Adam and Dixie) and Jamie (Tad's biological son with ex-wife Brooke English) lived with Tad and Dixie. Tad shared custody with Brooke, which pleased everyone. He was and an ideal stepfather to JR, despite the fact that JR's \"other\" father, Adam, is Tad's archenemy. Likewise, Dixie was an ideal stepmother to Jamie. Parkin and Stone reasoned that \"in this family, there are biological connections with children, but these are not shared between husband and wife. On today's soaps, this is as good as it gets. Tad and Dixie are happy to have created a family and they do not long to create biogenetic children together\".\n\nSteven Pinker, often called the world's leading expert on language and the mind lucidly, is another writer to document Tad and Dixie's romance for one of his examples analyzing the power of words. His book, \"The Language Instinct\", which is said to explain everything a person wanted to know about languages (how it works, how children learn it, how it changes, how the brain computes it, and how it evolved) received the William James Book Award from the American Psychological Association and the Public Interest Award from the Linguistic Society of America. Pinker wrote: \"Simply by making noises with our mouths, we can reliably cause precise new combinations of ideas to arise in each other's minds. The ability comes so naturally that we are apt to forget what a miracle it is.\"\n\nAs a demonstration, Pinker asks the reader to surrender only his or her imagination to his words for a few moments. He says that he can cause the reader to think some \"very specific thoughts\". Pinker gives a few immediate examples; he notes how the \"normally grayish body\" of a male octopus suddenly becomes striped when selecting a female to mate with, cherries jubilee on a white suit, wine on an altar cloth, and how immediately applying club soda to the white suit or altar cloth works well to remove the stains from the fabrics. In his next mention, Pinker notes a Tad and Dixie scene: \"When Dixie opens the door to Tad, she is stunned, because she thought he was dead,\" says Pinker. \"She slams it in his face and then tries to escape. However, when Tad says, 'I love you,' she lets him in. Tad comforts her, and they become passionate, When Brian interrupts, Dixie tells a stunned Tad that she and Brian were married earlier that day. With much difficulty, Dixie informs Brian that things are nowhere near finished between her and Tad. Then she spills the news that Jamie is Tad's son. 'My what?' says a shocked Tad.\"\n\nPinker asks the reader to think about the words of his Tad and Dixie example and how they resonate. \"I did not simply remind you of octopuses; in the unlikely event that you ever see one develop stripes, you now know what will happen next,\" he said. \"Perhaps the next time you are in a supermarket you will look for club soda, one out of the tens of thousands of items available, and then not touch it until months later when a particular substance and a particular object accidentally come together. You now share with millions of other people the secrets of protagonists in a world that is the product of some stranger's imagination, the daytime drama \"All My Children\".\"\n\nDr. Nancy Kalish's Lost Love Project, titled \"Lost And Found Lovers: Facts And Fantasies of Rekindled Romances\", is an experiment which documented people who seek out lost love and how often they achieve \"happy endings\". Kalish studied the accounts of 1,001 people who participated in the project. Her focus was not only on real-life couples but on fictional couples as well. She cited that \"Lost Love\" is also central to soap operas and film. The romance of Tad and Dixie is one that she took note of.\n\nIn addition, Tad and Dixie's romance has been referred to by fictional characters within books of fiction. In the book \"Along Came Mary: A Bad Girl Creek Novel\" (by writer Jo-Ann Mapson of the original bestseller \"Bad Girl Creek\"), character Mary Madigan details the extent of the impact that the Tad and Dixie love story has had on the people in her life: \"One thing I knew for sure, unless Mama had gotten a job, she was home, because it was time for \"All My Children\". Both MayAnn and Mama had a king-size investment in Tad and Dixie's marriage, the one union on earth they considered unbreakable. It was the source of most of their bickering.\"\n\nAnother analysis regarding Tad and Dixie's romance includes the aftermath of Dixie's first \"death\". Her sister, Di, pretends to be her during one of the show's storylines. Parts of the couple's romance were parodied in the book \"Teleparody: Predicting/Preventing the TV Discourse of Tomorrow\". In addition, \"All My Children - Daytime's Greatest Weddings\" have documented Tad and Dixie as one of the greatest romances ever told.\n\nIn early 2007, \"All My Children\" made the controversial decision to kill off Dixie. Dixie had been killed off before, but this time her death was permanent. The decision is considered \"one of the biggest upsets\" in daytime history. Former \"All My Children\" head writer Megan McTavish created the tale, tentatively titled the Satin Slayer storyline, which centered around a vicious serial killer murdering the women of a cosmetics company called Fusion. In what was poisoned food (peanut butter and banana pancakes) meant for Dixie's daughter-in-law, Babe Carey Chandler, Dixie ate instead. The poison almost immediately took effect and (after being rushed to the hospital) eventually killed the character within an hour.\n\nABC executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers later explained in an interview what the writers were going for with the storyline. Carruthers said, \"When Megan [McTavish, head writer] came up with this whole concept, it was about, 'How do we emotionally impact [upon] all the people we care about?' And obviously high stakes, and life-or-death stakes, really raise the bar of emotion. When you can tap into the personal relationships and the love and the caring and also the hopes and fears of all these people we've invested so much time and support in, you have compelling storytelling.\"\n\nThe writers felt that by killing Dixie, it was unexpected and went beyond \"just being about the women of Fusion\". Killing Dixie was to send a message that anyone could be the next to die. \"In order for a story like this to have real impact, it's not just about the reaction of our environment to the people who are lost,\" Carruthers said. \"You have to understand that it can affect anybody, you know? It's not just the girls in Fusion who you only see once a week. It's people who are pivotal to the environment, as well. I'm trying to say this in a way that doesn't undercut what the Fusion girls have meant to the canvas, particularly those three characters who've been attacked [ Simone, Erin and Danielle], but a character with as much history as Dixie... It shows that nothing is sacred and nothing is safe. By jumping off that diving board, not knowing what's at the bottom of the pool, you've now taken the story to a whole new level.\"\n\nViewers feeling that Dixie was \"too safe\" to kill is what \"ironically\" led to the writers to issue her demise. \"In order to keep the audience, who is as savvy as they are — which we love, by the way — on the edge of their seat,\" said Carruthers, \"they have to be able not to anticipate what the outcome is going to be. And to me, part of what we do is the element of surprise. Surprise that's validated by the play-out of the story, obviously; it's not just surprise for surprise's sake.\"\n\nThe audience disagreed with Carruthers. They expressed that the show made a \"ludicrous decision\" to keep Babe over Dixie. On February 18, 2007, it was reported that Cady McClain, Dixie's portrayer, had spoken out about what happened via her blog — to set the record straight and to ease the nerves of fans. Viewers had often voiced that Dixie was killed off because McClain was very out-spoken about matters she disagreed with in regards to the soap opera and executives. In December 2006, McClain learned that Dixie would be one of the Satin Slayer's victims. It was not until several weeks later, however, that the news of McClain's exit leaked to the media. Viewers speculated that her dismissal was due to her outspokenness about the exit of Emmy-winning actress Julia Barr (ex-Brooke English). Seemingly adding credibility to the rumor was a report from Fox News Channel stating that McClain's outspokenness led to ABC executives firing McClain. McClain responded on her blog: \"Who is this guy from Fox news and what does he know?\" She stated that her blog entries were always approved by ABC executives before they were posted to the Internet. \"I was talking about the character of Brooke when I said 'life is not fair,' [..] not Julia getting let go.\" \nGiving insight into what actually happened behind the scenes, McClain stated that \"the show's triumvirate of top executives decided that killing Dixie was the best way to move forward for a character that no one quite knew what to do with [anymore]\". She said, \"This [was] a mutual decision of Brian [Frons, president of Daytime for Disney-ABC Television Group], Julie [Hanan Carruthers, \"AMC's\" executive producer] and Megan [McTavish, \"AMC's\" head writer].\" McClain noted, \"I was told they all agreed on this decision.\"\n\nFurther frustrating fans, it seemed as though ABC had seemingly removed all references to McClain and Dixie from their official \"All My Children\" website earlier that month, which further outraged fans. To this, McClain responded, \"I really am only the actor. I don't think they will ever bring me back, especially if they have removed the Dixie CHARACTER bio from the website,\" McClain relayed. \"It's over. It's all done. \"AMC\" is going to become something totally different than it once was. It will be all new, all different. Why? I can only conjecture.\" Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: \"Do not stop watching \"All My Children\",\" McClain stated. \"There are some good actors on that show, the producers are trying new and innovative things, and the writers are trying out lots of concepts and ideas that you may ultimately find very entertaining.\"\n\nFans of the Tad and Dixie romance, in particular, respected McClain's words, but still sought ways to get Dixie back on canvas before the episode of Dixie's death even aired. Viewers sent \"thousands of angry letters\" threatening to stop watching the show to get ABC executives to take notice of their request. Their request, however, was not granted.\n\nIn March 2008, it was confirmed by ABC Daytime executives and McClain that Dixie would return to Pine Valley in the form of a ghost to lead Tad to Kate. McClain's first airdate was May 2, 2008. At that time, her last airdate as the character was on June 12, 2008. McClain additionally returned as Dixie's spirit in 2010 when her son, JR, is battling cancer. She greets \"Uncle Palmer\" Cortlandt into the great beyond upon the actor's (James Mitchell) passing. On April 29, 2011, it was confirmed [on McClain's Facebook page] that she would again reprise her role of Dixie Cooney Martin one final time. On May 17, 2011, Dixie was revealed to be alive, it was later revealed she was revived by David Hayward's Project Orpheus, and kept in the basements of Oak Haven.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2301634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301634", "title": "Bible prophecy", "text": "Bible prophecy\n\nBible prophecy or biblical prophecy comprises the passages of the Bible that reflect communications from God to humans through prophets. Jews and Christians usually consider the biblical prophets to have received revelations from God.\n\nProphetic passagesinspirations, interpretations, admonitions or predictionsappear widely distributed throughout Biblical narratives. Some future-looking prophecies in the Bible are conditional, with the conditions either implicitly assumed or explicitly stated.\n\nIn general, believers in biblical prophecy engage in exegesis and hermeneutics of scriptures which they believe contain descriptions of global politics, natural disasters, the future of the nation of Israel, the coming of a Messiah and of a Messianic Kingdom—as well as the ultimate destiny of humankind.\n\nProphets in the Hebrew Bible often warn the Israelites to repent of their sins and idolatries, with the threat of punishment or reward.\nThey attribute both blessings and catastrophes to the deity. According to believers in Bible prophecy, later biblical passages - especially those contained in the New Testament - contain accounts of the fulfillment of many of these prophecies.\n\nJudaism and Christianity have taken a number of biblical passages as prophecies or foreshadowings of a coming Messiah. Christians believe that Christ Jesus fulfills these messianic prophecies, while followers of Rabbinic Judaism still await the arrival of the Jewish Messiah and other signs of Jewish eschatology. Most Christians believe that the Second Coming of Christ will fulfill many messianic prophecies, though some Christians (Full Preterists) believe that all Messianic prophecies have already been fulfilled. Rabbinic Judaism does not separate the original coming of the Messiah and the advent of a Messianic Age. (For details of differences, see Christianity and Judaism.)\n\nA much-discussed issue within Christianity concerns the \"end times\", or \"last days\", particularly as depicted in the Book of Revelation.\n\n promises Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, and Genesis 17:8 states:\nF. F. Bruce argues that the fulfilment of this prophecy occurred during David's reign. He writes:\nChristian apologists point to corporate personality here to connect Abraham with the Jewish nation. H. Wheeler Robinson writes:\nGod is represented as guaranteeing that the Israelites would drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites from their lands, which the Israelites wanted to appropriate (). The same applies to the Girgashites (). In , this is referred to as a covenant, commandments being given. In Judges, the Israelites are described as disobeying the commandment to worship no other gods () and, as a result, not being able to drive out the Jebusites (). The Israelites did not drive all of the Canaanite tribes out in the lifetime of Joshua. The books of Joshua and Judges (Chapters 1) mention towns that could not be defeated. According to 2 Samuel, the Israelites occupied Canaan but the complete seizure took place only when David defeated the Jebusites in Jerusalem and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. ()\n\nGod states that the house, throne and kingdom of David and his offspring (called \"the one who will build a house for my Name\" in the verse) will last forever (2 Samuel 7:12–16; 2 Chronicles 13:5; Psalm 89:20–37). 1 Kings 9:4–7 as well as 1 Chronicles 28:5 and 2 Chronicle 7:17 state that Solomon's establishment is conditional on Solomon obeying God's commandments.\n\nSolomon built the temple in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 2:1; 6:7–10) and did not obey God's commandments (1 Kings 11:1–14).\n\nThe destruction of the Kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC brought an end to the rule of the royal house of David.\n\nSome scholars including Saul of Cyrene state that God has promised an eternal dynasty to David unconditionally (1 Kings 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19). They feel the conditional promise of 1 Kings 9:4–7 seems to undercut this unconditional covenant. Most interpreters have taken the expression \"throne of Israel\" as a reference to the throne of the United Monarchy. They see this as a conditionalization of the unconditional dynastic promise to David's house expressed in 1 Kings 11:36, 15:4 and 2 Kings 8:19. They argue the presence of both unconditional and conditional promises to the house of David would create intense theological dissonance in the Book of Kings.\n\nChristians believe that the promise is of surviving descendants that could fulfill the role of king rather than a permanent earthly kingship.\n\n\nI am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon... You will not die by the sword; you will die peacefully. (Jeremiah 34:2–5)\n\nThe Books of Kings and Jeremiah relate that Zedekiah's eyes were put out after he was taken to the King of Babylon and that he remained a prisoner in Babylon until his death (2 Kings 25:6–7 and Jeremiah 52:10–11). There is no other historical record of what happened with Zedekiah in Babylon.\n\nJosiah fought against the Egyptians although the pharaoh, Necho II, prophesied that God would destroy him if he did (2 Chronicles 35:21–22)—possibly Josiah was \"\"opposing the faithful prophetic party\"\". Josiah was killed in battle against the Egyptians (2 Kings 23:29–30). However, Judah was in a time of peace when Josiah died, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n\nIt will not take place, it will not happen... Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. ()\n\nAccording to \"God delivered the King of the Jews, Ahaz, into the hands of the King of Syria, who carried away a great multitude of them captives to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter\".In the prophet says clearly that a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the prophecy is that Ahaz stands firm in his faith. This means that he should trust God and not seek military help in the Assyrians which Ahaz nevertheless did.\n\nThe Book of Isaiah also foretold;\nChristian apologists state that the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 13 and 21 could possibly have been directed originally against Assyria whose capital Nineveh was defeated in 612 BC by a combined onslaught of the Medes and Babylonians. According to this explanation the prophecy was later updated and referred to Babylon not recognizing the rising power of Persia. On the other hand, it can be mentioned that the Persian King Cyrus after overthrowing Media in 550 BC did not treat the Medes as a subject nation.\n\nInstead of treating the Medes as a beaten foe and a subject nation, he had himself installed as king of Media and governed Media and Persia as a dual monarchy, each part of which enjoyed equal rights.\nThe prophecy may date from 735 BC when Damascus and Israel were allied against Judah. Tiglath-Pileser took Damascus in 732 BC, which some apologists point to as a fulfillment of this prophecy, but this campaign never reduced the city to rubble. The depiction of Damascus as a \"heap of ruins\" has been understood as figurative language to describe the despoiling of the city, the leading of its people as captives to Kir (an unidentified city), and the way that the city lost much of its wealth and political influence in the years following Tiglath-Pileser's attack. The prophecy is also believed by some to have a future fulfilment relating to end-time developments concerning Israel.\n\nThe passage is consistent with , which states that Assyria defeated the city and exiled the civilians to Kir.\n\nSome theologians argue the statement that the \"land of Judah\" will terrify the Egyptians is not a reference to a large army from Judah attacking Egypt but a circumlocution for the place where God lives. They argue it is God and his plans that will cause Egypt to be terrified. They go on to argue the second \"in that day\" message from verse 18 announces the beginning of a deeper relationship between God and Egypt which leads to Egypt's conversion and worshiping God (verses 19–21). They say the last \"in that day\" prophecy (verses 23–25) speaks about Israel, Assyria and Egypt as God's special people, thus, describing eschatological events.\n\nThere are many scholars, however, who point out that the prophet himself spoke of Cyrus arguing that Deutero-Isaiah interpreted Cyrus' victorious entry into Babylon in 539 BC as evidence of divine commission to benefit Israel. The main argument against the idols in these chapters is that they cannot declare the future, whereas God does tell future events like the Cyrus predictions.\n\nJeremiah prophesied that;\nIt lasted 68 years (605 BC–537 BC) from the capture of the land of Israel by Babylon and the exile of a small number of hostages including Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael (). It lasted 60 years (597–537 BC) from the deportation of the 10,000 elite () including Jehoiachin and Ezekiel though there is a discrepancy with Jeremiah's numbers of exiles (). It lasted 49 years (586–537 BC) from the exile of the majority of Judah () including Jeremiah who was taken to Egypt and leaving behind a poor remnant ().\nHowever, some Christian scholars try to explain the figure in a different way stating that Jeremiah gave a round number.\nChristian commentaries have considered the conquering Persian force an alliance between the Persians and the Medes. One suggests the use of the term \"Medes\" is due to earlier recognition among the Jews and because the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes. \nThe destruction of temple by the Romans in 70 brought an end to the Jewish sacrificial system.(33:18) (See Korban) Christians have stated this refers to the millennium in which Christ reigns for a thousand years, since Jeremiah 33:18 goes along with the eternal reign of the line of David in verses 21–22.\n\n\n\nTyre was an island fortress-city with mainland villages along the shore. These mainland settlements were destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II, but after a 13-year siege from 585–573 BC, the King of Tyre made peace with Nebuchadnezzar, going into exile and leaving the island city itself intact. Alexander the Great used debris from the mainland to build a causeway to the island, entered the city, and plundered the city, sacking it without mercy. Most of the residents were either killed in the battle or sold into slavery. It was quickly repopulated by colonists and escaped citizens, and later regained its independence. Tyre did eventually enter a period of decline, being reduced to a small remnant. Echoing Ezekiel's words, historian Philip Myers writes in 1889: The city never recovered from this blow. The site of the once brilliant maritime capital is now \"bare as the top of a rock,\" a place where the few fishermen that still frequent the spot spread their nets to dry. Older sources often refer to the locations as a \"fishing village\". However, the nearby area grew rapidly in the 20th century. The ruins of a part of ancient Tyre (a protected site) can still be seen on the southern half of the island whereas modern Tyre occupies the northern half and also sprawls across Alexander's causeway and onto the mainland. It is now the fourth largest city in Lebanon with a population of 14,000 people\n\n\nThis includes the claim that God will make Egypt so weak that it will never again rule over other nations. Pharaoh Amasis II (who drove off Nebuchadnezzar) also conquered Cyprus, ruling it until 545 BC. Despite being a powerful nation in ancient times, Egypt has since been ruled by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantine Empire, Ottomans, British and the French, and has also enjoyed periods of independence from external rule. During the Hellenistic period, the break-up of the empire of Alexander the Great left the Ptolemaic Dynasty (of Macedonian/Greek origin) as rulers of Egypt: the Ptolemies then conquered and ruled Cyrenaica (now northeastern Libya), Palestine, and Cyprus at various times. (see also History of Ptolemaic Egypt and Ptolemaic kingdom).\n\nThere is some uncertainty among modern scholars regarding when (and by whom) various portions of the Book of Ezekiel were written, making the timing of prophecies difficult to unravel (see Book of Ezekiel).\n\nNebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt around 568 BC. However, the armies of Pharaoh Amasis II defeated the Babylonians (though the author did not elaborate and there are no known detailed accounts of this invasion). Herodotus reports that this Pharaoh had a long and prosperous reign. The Egyptians were conquered by the Persians in 525 BC.\n\n\n\n\"When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\" ()\n\nThe Christian response is varied:\n\nMoffatt puts it \"before the Son of man arrives\" as if Jesus referred to this special tour of Galilee. Jesus could overtake them. Possibly so, but it is by no means clear. Some refer it to the Transfiguration, others to the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, others to the Second Coming. Some hold that Matthew has put the saying in the wrong context. Others bluntly say that Jesus was mistaken, a very serious charge to make in his instructions to these preachers. The use of ἑως [heōs] with aorist subjunctive for a future event is a good Greek idiom.\n\nPreterist scholars explain this verse as referring to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD with the phrase \"before the Son of Man comes\" meaning before judgment comes upon the nation of Israel and the city of Jerusalem for rejecting Jesus Christ as The Messiah. They reject to refer Matthew 10:23 to the second coming of Jesus because Jesus speaks to his disciples about the towns of Israel:\n\nSuch a view completely divorces the passage from its immediate and localized context, such as the fact that this was an admonition to the apostles – and not directed to a generation several millennia removed from the first century.\n\nThe Wycliffe Bible Commentary disagrees with this view:\n\nIn the similar context of Mt 24:8–31 the great tribulation and the second advent are in view. Hence, the \"coming of the Son of man\" is probably eschatological here also. This would have been more readily understood by the disciples, who would hardly have thought to equate this \"coming\" with the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.\n\"as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" (See also Matthew 16:21, 20:19, Mark 8:31, 9:31, 10:34, Luke 11:29–30 and John 2:19) According to Mark 15:42–46, Jesus was buried in Friday night and according to Matthew 28:1–6 and John 20:1, Jesus' tomb was found empty on Sunday dawn.\nIt is customary for eastern nations to count part of a day as a whole 24-hour day.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\n\nChristian responses have been varied:\n\nSome of them that stand here (τινες των ὁδε ἑστωτων [tines tōn hode hestōtōn]). A \"crux interpretum\" in reality. Does Jesus refer to the transfiguration, the resurrection of Jesus, the great day of Pentecost, the destruction of Jerusalem, the second coming and judgment? We do not know, only that Jesus was certain of his final victory which would be typified and symbolized in various ways.\n\nPreterists respond that Jesus did not mean His second coming but a demonstration of His might when He says \"coming in his kingdom\". In this view, this was accomplished by the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD when some of the Apostles were still living and thus fulfilling the word of Jesus that only some will not have died.\nOthers argue it refers to the Transfiguration. The Wycliffe Bible Commentary states:\n\nThis coming of the Son of Man in his kingdom is explained by some as the destruction of Jerusalem and by others as the beginning of the Church. But referring it to the Transfiguration meets the requirements of the context (all Synoptists follow this statement with the Transfiguration, Mk 9:1; Lk 9:27). Furthermore, Peter, who was one of those standing here, referred to the Transfiguration in the same words (II Pet 1:16–18). Chafer calls the Transfiguration a \"preview of the coming kingdom on earth\" (L. S. Chafer, Systematic Theology, V, 85).\n\nHereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.\n\nThe word \"you will see\" is in Greek \"ὄψεσθε\" [opheste, from the infinitive optomai] which is plural. Jesus meant that the Jews, and not just the high priest, will see his coming.\n\n\nChristians argue that the first cock-crow is simply missing from Matthew, Luke, and John. In Matthew (), Luke (), and John (), Jesus foretells three denials of Peter before cock-crow. , , report the fulfillment of this prophecy. In , Jesus speaks of two cock-crows, which is mentioned in as having taken place. Christians argue that Matthew, Luke, and John removed the first cock-crow and diminished (Luke even eliminated) the partial exit by Peter after the first denial (which Mark reports). If Mark was the \"interpreter of Peter\", he would have gotten his information directly and thus would be considered the more reliable source.\n\n\nJesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. \"Do you see all these things?\" he asked. \"I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\"\n\nPreterists claim these verses are metaphorical. Others claim that the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70 fulfilled this despite the existence of the wailing wall. The IVP Bible Background Commentary states:\n\nSome stones were left on others (e.g., part of one wall still stands), but this fact does not weaken the force of the hyperbole: the temple was almost entirely demolished in A.D. 70.\n\nThe parts of the wall Jesus refers to in the verse may not have included the wailing wall. Recent archaeological evidence suggest that the wailing wall part of the temple complex was not completed until an uncertain date in or after 16 A.D.\n\nNation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.\n\nThe famines part of this verse has often been associated with the third seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:5–6), and the pestilences and earthquakes aspect has often been associated with the fourth seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:7–8). The presence of the term birthpains could be representative of better times ahead. Scholars point out that these events have always been on earth, so the verse must refer to a significant increase in the intensity of them.\n\nThere are also instances of erroneous, or untraceable, quotations from the prophets cited by the early Christians:\n\nChristian writers have given several responses. First is that the use of Jeremiah is meant to refer to all the books of prophecy. Second is that although Jeremiah said this, any record has not survived. Third is this was the result of a scribal error because of the single letter difference in the abridged versions of the names.\n\n\nChristians have given several responses. First is that this prophecy has not survived to the present day. Second is the Greek word \"nazaret\" does not mean Nazarene but is related to the Hebrew word \"netzer\" which can be translated as 'branch'. Third is that the verse is not a prophetic saying but simply reflects an Old Testament requirement for the Messiah to be held in contempt, (Psalm 22:6–8; 69:9–11, 19–21; Isaiah 53:2–4, 7–9) which they argue Nazarenes were (John 1:46; John 7:52).\n\nSome scholars respond that this is because the Malachi reference was just an introduction, which made it significantly less important than Isaiah 40:3, leading to the whole being attributed to the prophet Isaiah. Other reasons given are Isaiah's authority was considered higher than Malachi and the Isaiah text was better known.\n\n\n...we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. (1 Thessalonians 4:15–17)\n\nChristians argue that Paul speaks about his own presence at the last day only hypothetically. They point out Paul later states the Day of the Lord comes like a thief () which is a word Jesus uses himself () expressing the impossibility of predicting His second coming ().\nThere are different attempts to explain the term \"to take his seat in the temple of God\". Some understand it as a divine attribute which the man of lawlessness arrogates to himself and hence no conclusion can be drawn for time and place. Many in the early Church, such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome, Origen and Cyril of Jerusalem, believed a literal Temple would be rebuilt by the Antichrist before the Lord's Second Coming whereas Jerome and John Chrysostom referred the Temple to the Church. Also some today's scholars refer the phrase \"God's temple\" to the Church pointing out that Paul used this term five other times outside 2 Thessalonians and does not refer it to a literal temple.\nThe Church fathers such as John Chrysostom who lived at the time of Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Encratites, the Manicheans—who rejected Christian marriage and the eating of because they believed that all flesh was from an evil principle—asserted this text referred to such sects and that they were therefore \"in the latter times\". The Protestant theologian John Gill believed that this refers to the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, particularly priestly celibacy and Lent as promulgated by the medieval church. (see Great Apostasy)\nSome Christian scholars believe the verses 11–14 refer to the era of salvation beginning with Christ's resurrection and its coming fulfillment on the last day. Thus, they think that the claim Paul makes here about salvation is a claim every Christian and not only Paul in his time can affirm. Some see this verse as indicating that there are no prophesied or salvation events before the Lord comes. Those holding the belief that Paul has a longer time span in view point to its context after Romans 11, which describes the repentance of all of Israel in future. They also point to Paul's plan to visit Rome and more western places in Romans 15 as indicating that he did not believe Christ's return would be soon enough to simply wait for it.\n\n\nThe word \"soon\" (other translations use \"shortly\" or \"quickly\") does not have to be understood in the sense of close future. The Norwegian scholar Thorleif Boman explained that the Israelites, unlike Europeans or people in the West, did not understand time as something measurable or calculable according to Hebrew thinking but as something qualitative:\n\nWe have examined the ideas underlying the expression of calculable time and more than once have found that the Israelites understood time as something qualitative, because for them time is determined by its content.\" \n...the Semitic concept of time is closely coincident with that of its content without which time would be quite impossible. The quantity of duration completely recedes behind the characteristic feature that enters with time or advances in it. Johannes Pedersen comes to the same conclusion when he distinguishes sharply between the Semitic understanding of time and ours. According to him, time is for us an abstraction since we distinguish time from the events that occur in time. The ancient Semites did not do this; for them time is determined by its content.\n\nThe following are the scriptural requirements in Judaism concerning the Messiah, his actions, and his reign. Jewish sources insist that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright. Some Christians maintain that some of these prophecies are associated with a putative second coming while Jewish scholars state there is no concept of a second coming in the Hebrew Bible.\n\n\nWhile Christian biblical scholars have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.\nThe gospels of Mark, Luke, and John state Jesus sent his disciples after only one animal. (Mark 11:1–7, Luke 19:30–35, John 12: 14,15) Critics claim this is a contradiction with some mocking the idea of Jesus riding two animals at the same time. A response is that the text allows for Jesus to have ridden on a colt that was accompanied by a donkey, perhaps its mother.\n\nRashi, a 10th-century French rabbi, gave the following commentaries regarding Bible prophecies:\n\nThese passages have been interpreted by some Muslim scholars as prophetic references to Muhammad. This claim has always been unacceptable to most Bible scholars. All the following are Muslim scholars' interpretations of various Biblical passages.\n\nBahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the return of Christ \"in the glory of the Father\" and that the passages below were fulfilled by the coming of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh, the two most recent Manifestations of God, in 1844 AD and 1863 AD, respectively.\n\n\nLatter-Day Saints believe that the following biblical passages prophesy or otherwise support the provenance of the Book of Mormon:\n\n\nBiblical prophecy is believed to be literally true by a number of conservative Christians, such as Norman Geisler and Young Earth Creationists. Interpreters uphold this principle by providing details of prophecies that have been fulfilled. Interpreters also dispute the legitimacy of non-biblical prophets and psychics. Professor Peter Stoner and Dr. Hawley O. Taylor, for example, believed the Bible prophecies were too remarkable and detailed to occur by chance. Arthur C. Custance maintained that the Ezekiel Tyre prophecy (Ezek. 26: 1–11; 29:17–20) was remarkable.\n\nThese interpretive issues are related to the more general idea of how passages should be read or interpreted—a concept known as Biblical hermeneutics. Bible prophecy is an area which is often discussed in regard to Christian apologetics. Traditional Jewish readings of the Bible do not generally reflect the same attention to the details of prophecies. Maimonides stated that Moses was the greatest of the prophets and only he experienced direct revelation. Concern with Moses' revelation involves law and ethical teaching more than predictive prophecy. According to Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed the prophets used metaphors and analogies and, except for Moses, their words are not to be taken literally.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, prophecy ceased in Israel following the rebuilding of the second temple. Nonetheless Maimonides held that a prophet can be identified if his or her predictions come true.\n\nMany scholarly and popular interpreters have argued that a prophecy may have a dual fulfillment; others have argued for the possibility of multiple fulfillments. In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an apotelesmatic interpretation of specific prophecies.\n\nIn Christian eschatology, the idea of at least a dual fulfillment is usually applied to passages in the apocalyptic books of Daniel or Revelation, and to the apocalyptic discourse of Jesus in the synoptic gospels (Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21), especially in interpretations that predict a future tribulation and a future Antichrist figure. Futurists and Historicists usually hold to variations of this view, while Preterists see the same passages as applying only to events and persecutions from the time of Daniel through the first century CE. Some who believe in multiple fulfillment tend to restrict the idea to a view of history where ancient events reflecting Israel and first-century Judaism and Christianity are predictors of larger future events to happen on a global scale at a point in time, while others tend to include symbolic applications of prophecies to multiple entities and events throughout history.\n\nHenry Kett suggested multiple fulfillments in his 1799 book \"History the Interpreter of Prophecy\", in which he outlined numerous fulfillments for Antichrist prophecies, with chapters on the \"Papal power\", \"Mahometanism\" and \"Infidelity\" as parts of a long series of fulfillments of the prophecies.\n\nSamuel Horsley (1733-1806) stated \"The application of the prophecy to any one of these events bears all the characteristics of a true interpretation\".\n\nMoses Stuart (1780–1852) differentiated the idea that a prophetic passage has an inherent dual sense or double meaning from the idea of a later application of the prophecy in subsequent events, separate from the original prophecy: \"In these principles there is no double sense; no ὑπόνοια \"[huponoia or \"suspicion\"]\", in the sense in which that word is usually employed and understood. But there may be an apotelesmatic view or sense of a passage in the ancient Scriptures; and this is the case whenever a proceeding or a principle is reillustrated or reconfirmed. This makes out no double sense, but a fuller and more complete exhibition of the one and simple meaning of the original. Well may it be named a πλήρωσις \"[plerosis or \"fulfillment / fulfilling\"]\".\" Stuart noted prior usage of the term \"apotelesmatic\" by European interpreters.\n\nOther interpreters have referred to an apotelesmatic meaning of prophecy as a collapsing of perspective of \"near\" and \"far\" or \"inaugurated\" and \"consummated\" fulfillments, where from the viewpoint of the ancient Israelite prophet local events affecting Israel are merged with end-time cosmic events relating to the kingdom of God.\n\nC. F. Keil (1807–1888) suggested in an influential commentary \"this uniting together of the two events is not to be explained only from the perspective and apotelesmatic character of the prophecy, but has its foundation in the very nature of the thing itself. The prophetic perspective, by virtue of which the inward eye of the seer beholds only the elevated summits of historical events as they unfold themselves, and not the valleys of the common incidents of history which lie between these heights, is indeed peculiar to prophecy in general, and accounts for the circumstance that the prophecies as a rule give no fixed dates, and apotelesmatically bind together the points of history which open the way to the end, with the end itself.\"\n\nSeventh-day Adventist theologian Desmond Ford (Historicist) termed this belief the apotelesmatic principle and stated \"The ultimate fulfillment is the most comprehensive in scope, though details of the original forecast may be limited to the first fulfillment.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Dispensational Futurist theologian Randall Price applies the term \"apotelesmatic\" primarily to the sense of \"prophetic postponement\" or \"an interruption in fulfillment\" that dispensationalists hold occurs between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks of the seventy weeks prophecy of Daniel 9:24–27: \"The technical expression for this delay in the fulfillment of the messianic program for Israel is derived from the Greek verb \"apotelo\" meaning, 'to bring to completion, finish.' The usual sense of \"telos\" as 'end' or 'goal' may here have the more technical idea of 'the consummation that comes to prophecies when they are fulfilled' (Luke 22:37). With the prefix \"apo\", which basically has the connotation of 'separation from something,' the idea is of a delay or interruption in the completion of the prophetic program. Therefore, \"apotelesmatic\" interpretation recognizes that in Old Testament texts that present the messianic program as a single event, a near and far historical fulfillment is intended, separated by an indeterminate period of time. Dispensational writers have referred to this as an 'intercalation' or a 'gap.' However, prophetic postponement better expresses this concept.\"\n\n\"Halley's Bible Handbook\", the \"Scofield Reference Bible\" and many other Bible commentaries hold that the \"little horn\" of Daniel 8 is fulfilled both with Antiochus Epiphanes (reigned 175-164 BC) and with a future Antichrist. Henry Kett, taking the writings of Sir Isaac Newton, advanced to identifying three fulfillments: Antiochus Epiphanes, the Romans, and a future Antichrist. Several Historicist interpreters (Faber, Bickersteth, Keith, Elliott, etc.) proposed the same, but noted that the Roman Empire is classified in two forms, the Pagan and the Papal, and that the Roman Empire was also split (East and West), and that in the East Mohammed or his religion were also meant, and more particularly the Turks, and that the final form (particularly according to authors writing after the Crimean War of 1853-1856) was Russia.\n\nMethodist theologian Adam Clarke (ca 1761-1832) concurred with Anglican bishop Thomas Newton (1704-1782) that the abomination of desolation as a proverbial phrase could include multiple events “substituted in the place of, or set up in opposition to, the ordinances of God, his worship, his truth, etc.” This allows for viewing some, or all of the following events as partial fulfillments of this prophecy simultaneously:\n\n\nThe British Israelist Howard Rand (1963) wrote, “because men have been able to see one—and only one—fulfillment, they have missed the greater scope of this prophecy and their understanding of the full message has been thwarted. ... Too, because of the double, triple and quadruple applications of this prophecy to world events, an enormous amount of history is involved in the cryptogrammic language of the vision.”\n\nAmong most Christian denominations, the prophecy that Jesus will return to Earth is a major doctrine, which can be seen by its inclusion in the Nicene Creed. Many specific timeframes for this prediction have been declared by individuals and groups, although many of these dates have expired without the occurrences predicted. An official statement of the Vatican, issued in 1993, asserted, \"\"we are already in the last hour\"\".\n\nBiblical references claimed to prophesy the end times include:\n\n\n"}

These stoves are designed primarily for backpackers, with a focus on light weight, durability and simple design. First sold in 1925, Trangia stoves were initially preferred to kerosene (paraffin) pressure stoves because they required only one type of fuel (alcohol, usually in the form of methylated spirit). Trangia's selling point is that the entire packaged stove, including pots, is not significantly larger than a standard camp cooking pot. For this reason the Trangia has retained much of its popularity despite the development of alternative stove fuels and designs.\n\nThe standard stove set includes a base, which lifts the burner off the ground and has vents to provide airflow, and a windscreen, which protects the pot and flame (the latter leading to its Swedish nickname, the \"stormkök\", or \"storm kitchen\"). The standard stove also includes two billycans (pots), a pot lid/frying pan, an optional kettle and a handle, commonly referred to as a \"billy grip\", used to grip onto the lip of the pots and pans. The entire set is designed to fit together in a single, portable package.\n\nThe burner is a small brass cup that looks and functions similar to a beverage-can stove. Fuel is poured into the burner and ignited. The heat from the flame causes the fuel to vaporize, forcing it out of 23 or 24 jets around the top of the burner, and producing a steady cooking flame. The burner includes a removable \"simmer ring\", which partially blocks the flame in order to reduce heat output and threaded lid.\n\nAlternative burners are available allowing gas cartridges or white gasoline to fuel the Trangia.\n\nThe standard stove sets come in several variants, with varying sizes of pots, some with non-stick finishes. A similar burner produced by Trangia is also a component in the Swedish military mess kit. The Finnish Defence Forces use the Trangia, given to soldiers when needed and does not form part of the basic equipment.\n\nThere is also a Mini Trangia. It was specially produced for the multi-sport competition KIMM (Karrimor International Mountain Marathon). This consists of a standard burner (with simmer ring), small wind shield, 800 ml (28 fl oz) pot, 15 cm (6\") frying pan and pot/pan grip (handle). The entire package weighs just 330 grams (12 oz), according to Trangia's website. The Mini Trangia is much more portable than the standard-sized Trangia and is even lighter than most liquid-fuelled, pressure stoves (which don't include pots or pans in the weight). However, it is not as windproof as the full-size Trangias.\n\nOriginally, Trangia stoves were made entirely from aluminium (except for the burner, which has always been brass), in order to keep them lightweight. However, aluminum makes for a poor cooking surface, as food sticks to it, and it can add odd tastes to certain foods. Later, Trangia introduced Teflon-coated pots and pans. These are better for cooking, though the Teflon is susceptible to flaking off over time. More recently introduced is cookware made from titanium, ultra-light aluminum, anodized ultra-light aluminum, and \"Duossal\" (a portmanteau of \"duo\", \"stainless steel\", and \"aluminum\"), which is aluminum with a stainless steel cooking surface.\n\n\n"}

It is the potassium salt of peroxymonosulfuric acid.\n\nThe triple salt 2KHSO·KHSO·KSO (known by the tradename Oxone) is a form with higher stability. The standard electrode potential for this compound is +1.81 V with a half reaction generating the hydrogen sulfate (pH=0).\n\nMPS is a versatile oxidant. It oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids; in the presence of alcoholic solvents, the esters may be obtained. Internal alkenes may be cleaved to two carboxylic acids (see below), while terminal alkenes may be epoxidized. Sulfides give sulfones, tertiary amines give amine oxides, and phosphines give phosphine oxides.\n\nIllustrative of the oxidative power of this salt is the conversion of an acridine derivative to the corresponding acridine-N-oxide.\n\nMPS will also oxidize a sulfide to a sulfone with 2 equivalents. With one equivalent the reaction converting sulfide to sulfoxide is much faster than that of sulfoxide to sulfone, so the reaction can conveniently be stopped at that stage if so desired.\n\nMPS can also react with ketones to form dioxiranes, with the synthesis of dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) being representative. These are versatile oxidising agents and may be used for the epoxidation of olefins. In particular, if the starting ketone is chiral then the epoxide may be generated enantioselectively, which forms the basis of the Shi epoxidation.\n\nPotassium peroxymonosulfate can be used in swimming pools to keep the water clear, thus allowing chlorine in pools to work to sanitize the water rather than clarify the water, resulting in less chlorine needed to keep pools clean. One of the drawbacks of using potassium peroxymonosulfate in pools is it can cause the common DPD #3 water test for combined chlorine to read incorrectly high. Moreover, the byproducts can be formed during the peroxymonosulfate treatment, which are sometimes even more toxic than the original contaminants.\n"}

It was developed after 1965 to replace the AMX-VCI in service with the mechanized regiments of the French Army; the first prototypes were completed in 1968. Production commenced between 1972 and 1973.\n\nThe AMX-10P is fully amphibious, being propelled through water at speeds of up to 7 km/h by twin waterjets. It is also fitted as standard with a trim vane and bilge pumps to assist with the flotation process. AMX-10Ps were popular with a number of Arab armies and have been operated by Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Special marine variants were also developed for Singapore and Indonesia, including a fire support model known as the \"AMX-10 PAC 90\", which mated the AMX-10P chassis to the complete turret and 90 mm gun assembly of the Panhard ERC-90 Sagaie.\n\nAMX-10Ps share a number of common transmission and chassis components with their armoured car counterpart, the AMX-10RC.\n\nThe AMX-10P was developed by the \"Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux\" (AMX) in response to a French army requirement for a new tracked armoured fighting vehicle to supplement or replace the ageing \"AMX-VCI\". The first prototypes were completed around 1968 and showcased to potential domestic and international customers at Satory the following year. Production did not commence on the vehicle until the French Army placed its first order in late 1972. The first AMX-10Ps were delivered in mid to late 1973 to the 7th Mechanised Brigade stationed at Reims. French Army AMX-10Ps were fitted with a 20 mm autocannon in a \"Toucan II\" two-man turret with seating for a gunner and commander; however, a number of other one-man turrets could be fitted, as well as an observation cupola for training vehicles. Export variants of the AMX-10P also abounded, including models equipped with battlefield surveillance radars, the ATILA artillery fire control system, a bank of HOT anti-tank missiles, 60 mm or 81 mm gun-mortars, and a large 90 mm gun.\n\nGreece was the first foreign power to purchase the AMX-10P; between 1974 and 1977 the Hellenic Army ordered over a hundred individual vehicles from France, in three separate variants. Qatar followed up with an order for thirty AMX-10Ps in 1975, while Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia also accounted for large export orders during the early 1980s. GIAT Industries accepted a final order from Singapore for AMX-10P PAC-90s in 1994; following their delivery production lines for the AMX-10P were finally closed. At this point 1,750 AMX-10Ps had been manufactured.\n\nApproximately 108 AMX-10Ps remaining in service with the French Army underwent extensive overhauls to improve their armour and mobility between 2006 and 2008, including new gearboxes and suspension systems. They are gradually being retired and replaced by the wheeled Véhicule Blindé de Combat d'Infanterie.\n\nAMX-10P hulls are fabricated from a welded steel or aluminum alloy and notable for their parallel incorporation of the driving and engine compartments. The driver is seated at the front of the vehicle and to the left. An AMX-10P's driving compartment is provided with a single hatch cover opening to the rear and three periscopes intended for observation purposes when the hatch is closed. Night vision equipment was not fitted as standard to the base production model; however, one of the three driving periscopes could be replaced with combined day/night intensification sights as needed. The troop compartment is at the rear of the hull and provided with two roof hatches. Passengers embark and debark from a ramp, which is accessed through two doors at the rear.\n\nTransmission consists of a hydraulic torque converter coupled to a gearbox with one reverse and four forward driving gears. The AMX-10P utilises a torsion bar suspension, which supports five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and idler near the rear. These can be accessed from inside the hull through maintenance panels.\n\nStandard AMX-10P turrets are equipped with a GIAT M693 automatic cannon firing two different types of both high explosive ammunition and armour-piercing ammunition. More than one ammunition type may be loaded at once and fired alternatively. The high explosive rounds have a muzzle velocity of 1,050 m/s, while the latest armour-piercing round has a muzzle velocity of 1,300 m/s and is capable of penetrating 20 mm of rolled homogeneous armour at an incidence of 60°. The autocannon has a cyclic rate of fire of 740 rounds per minute, with the gunner being able to switch between semiautomatic, limited burst, or fully automatic fire as necessary.\n\nAMX-10Ps have a very distinctive, pointed hull and a sloping glacis plate, with the driver's position plainly visible to the left. The hull roof is horizontal as well as sloped slightly inwards, accommodating a turret ring near the centre of the chassis. Both hull sides are vertical and lack firing ports. There is a circular exhaust outlet on the right side of the hull above the second and third road wheels.\n\n\n\"This section is about operators of the AMX-10P tracked infantry fighting vehicle and its engineering and recovery variants.

He was the second bassist and co-founder of the alternative metal band Marilyn Manson. His stage name is a combination of fictional character Gidget and serial killer Ed Gein.\n\nGein was born and raised in Hollywood, Florida. His mother was a Roman Catholic schoolteacher and his father was a police officer. His parents divorced when he was the age of 3 and his mother remarried a few years later to a carny and a birthday clown who became Gein's step father. \"He was like Krusty the Clown,\" describes Gein. \"And he was a rampant alcoholic, so after these birthday parties, he would hang out with the parents and drink. Then he'd come home, reeking and smoking cigars in his clown makeup, drunk off his ass, busting shit, being nasty. That was a weekly occurrence.\"\n\nAs a child he attended Catholic school and his favorite movies were \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" and \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\".\n\nStewart joined the band Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids in 1989. The band eventually gained the attention of Trent Reznor who signed them to his label Nothing Records. As the band became more famous after dropping the \"Spooky Kids\" title in 1992, Gein's personality was becoming more chaotic through extensive drug use and other various acts of debauchery. In October 1993, Reznor agreed to rework the production on Marilyn Manson's album, taking them and their tapes to The Record Plant in Los Angeles. On Christmas Eve of 1993, Gein was hospitalized after overdosing on heroin. While still hospitalized, he received a message from Marilyn Manson's lawyer via FedEx that he was fired due to his drug use. Gein was replaced by Jeordie White, known as Twiggy Ramirez.\n\nAfter being fired from Marilyn Manson, he formed a group called Gidget Gein and the Dali Gaggers. The group featured vocalist Anthony Taboada, a.k.a. Alistarr Liddell, and guitarist Al B. Romano which highlighted displays of degenerate art, ideas, and post-punk styled songwriting. The group released the album \"Just AdNauseam\" in 1998. Before the release of the Dali Gaggers' second album, \"Confessions of a Spooky Kid\" in 1999, Gein relapsed and began shooting heroin. He headed back to Florida in order to kick his drug addiction and began work for the south Florida medical examiner as a \"bag boy\", spending years retrieving and cleaning up after the deceased. His macabre experiences at the coroner's office have been documented in various international magazines and spurred a script and early production of a motion picture entitled \"Bag Boy\" which never saw a release.\n\nDuring the production of Marilyn Manson's \"The Golden Age of Grotesque\" album in 2003, Gein and Manson reunited to collaborate in a music video independently produced for the song \"Saint\" (stylized as \"(s)AINT\"). Directed by Asia Argento and containing scenes of violence, nudity, masturbation, drug-use and self-mutilation, Interscope considered it \"too graphic\" and refused to be associated with the project, although it was later included on international editions of the \"\" bonus DVD. \"NME\" referred to the video as \"one of the most explicit music videos ever made\", and both \"Time\" and \"SF Weekly\" included it on their respective lists of the 'Most Controversial Music Videos'.\n\nGein returned to Los Angeles in 2004. During the final few years of his life, he was very active in various film, art and musical projects. He acted in several independent films including \"The Three Trials\", \"The Devil's Muse\" and others. During this final period, he was at the forefront of the \"UnPop and \"GaGa\" style art and fashion movements. His mixed media art was typically billed under his trademark GOLLYWOOD brand and featured various themes of blaxploitation, transgender people, and grotesque depictions of pop culture icons. Examples of his art can still be found at the Hyaena Art Gallery in Burbank, Ca.\n\nOn October 8, 2008, Stewart died of a suspected drug overdose at his home in Burbank, California. His body was discovered on October 9. Shortly before his death, Gein had completed another stint in rehab and was reportedly recording an album with record producer Dave Jerden. He had been contracted to publish his art in a show scheduled for February 2009.\n\nOn December 8, 2008, a memorial benefit for Gein was held at the Dragonfly in Los Angeles. It featured Gein's art and an array of friends and fans performing in his honor. The guest list included Ego Plum, Kim Fowley, ex Courtney Love guitarist Lisa Leveridge, Jessicka, Allen Wrench, Lenora Claire, Courtney Cruz, Ramzi Abed, Brian Clark (co-founder of the UnPop art movement to which Gein belonged), Bill Shafer of Hyaena Gallery (his art representative), Damian Crowley, Giddle Partridge, Hollie Stevens, and drag queens Squeaky Blonde and Fade-Dra. Funds raised from the gathering were used to purchase a memorial plaque in Gein's honor that was placed at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Gein's mother retains possession of his cremains in Florida.\n\nA commemorative tribute was filmed on October 9, 2010 at the horror convention 'Spooky Empire', based in Orlando, Florida. Participants included Al B. Romano, Billy Baker, Parris Mayhew, Mike Merryfield, CC Manded from Murder Museum, and Petey Mongelli. The 9-part compendium was filmed by the Film Director/Artist/Musician Cynosure and is respectively owned by Cynosure Enterprises. The film closes with Gein's memorial plaque, embellished with the slogan, 'Luv is GG'.\n\nIn January 2016 it was revealed via Facebook that Gein's band Dali Gaggers was reforming in North Carolina by some fans with the intent to carry on Gein's legacy by playing his songs as well as writing new songs in similar fashion. The followup to Gein's album \"Just Ad Nauseam\"/\"Confessions of a Spooky Kid\", entitled \"Abraxas\", was set to be released sometime in late 2016. However, as of Early 2019 no new information has been posted about the album nor has there been any new updates from the band.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301683", "title": "Jouhikko", "text": "Jouhikko\n\nThe jouhikko is a traditional, two- or three-stringed bowed lyre, from Finland and Karelia, Russia. Its strings are traditionally of horsehair. The playing of this instrument died out in the early 20th century but has been revived and there are now a number of musicians playing it.\n\nThe Jouhikko is also called jouhikannel or jouhikantele, meaning a bowed kantele. In English, the usual modern designation is bowed lyre, although the earlier preferred term bowed harp is also met with. There are different names for the instrument in different languages.\n\nPerhaps the earliest definite depiction of this kind of instrument is the stone carving from Trondheim Cathedral, Norway, dating from the second quarter of the 14th century.\n\n18th-century writers in Latin mention instruments that seem to be a jouhikko, but the first illustration comes from c. 1830 CE. Folk music collectors in the late 19th and early 20th century visited players in Finland and Karelia, and collected instruments, noted tunes, made field recordings and took photographs.\n\nThe jouhikko repertory was mostly collected in the field by A. O. Väisänen from 1913 to 1931. The jouhikko was used for playing dance music, and the collected tunes are very short, and were largely improvised. The scale of the jouhikko is only 6 notes, with a constantly sounding drone.\n\nIn a three-string jouhikko, the middle string, or in a two-string instrument, the lower or left hand string, is the drone string. Absolute pitch is not fixed, but in Nieminen's charts this is given the note d. The upper or right hand string, passing over the finger-hole, is fingered to give a scale, and this scale typically runs upwards from the note a 4th above the drone, or in Nieminen's charts, g a b c d e. The third or left hand string can be tuned down to a lower drone, or up to provide one of the melody notes.\n\nThe strings are stopped by touching them with the back of the fingers (the knuckles or nails), as there is no fingerboard to press the strings against. This fingering method is rather similar to the igil or the sarangi which also lack fingerboards. To touch the melody string the hand is inserted through a hole in the flat wooden board that makes up the top third of the instrument.\n\nOn a 3-string instrument tuned g-d-a, the first note of the scale is played on the g string, which cannot be fingered as it lies on the far side of the drone and out of reach of the hand hole. The second note is the a string played open. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth notes of the scale are played with the backs of the four fingers, stopping the a string. Whilst it is possible to play higher notes by moving the hand further up the string all the traditional melodies are within a compass of six notes, the first six notes of either a major or minor scale.\n\nModern instruments are made with horsehair, nylon, gut or even metal viola strings . Following Estonian talharpa technique, the hand hole is often made larger so that the hand can be inserted between the first and second strings, stopping the first with the insides of the fingers and the second with the outside\n\nThe most prominent recent use of the jouhikko is the Finnish folk band Jouhiorkesteri, whose member Rauno Nieminen is considered to be the modern master of the instrument. Other bands using jouhikko include Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani, and Estonian folk metal bands Raud-Ants and Metsatöll.\n\nKvitrafn (Einar Selvik) of the Norwegian traditional/folk band Wardruna uses his own made Jouhikko on their 2009 album Runaljod – Gap Var Ginnunga.\n\nThe Jouhikko sound has been recently popularized in performances by the traditional siberian/norse folk music of 'Nyttland' and also in the dark age trance music from celtic duo 'Primordia'.\n\nThe jouhikko is a member of a family of bowed lyre type instruments that stretches from Russia in the east, through Scandinavia, to Britain and Ireland. Most of these regions have only very sketchy evidence about their extinct bowed lyre traditions. The four-stringed Estonian talharpa and hiiu kannel have a wider hand hole and can play a wider range and shifting drones. The Welsh crwth is the most developed of this family to survive, with six strings, a fingerboard, and a complex playing style. Extinct or obscure variants include the Shetland gue and the English \"crowd\". Other instruments are perhaps less closely related, including the bowed zithers such as the Finnish harppu, Icelandic fiðla, and the North American Inuit tautirut.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301687", "title": "Repossession", "text": "Repossession\n\nRepossession, colloquially repo, is a \"self-help\" type of action - mainly in the U.S. - in which the party having right of ownership of the property in question takes the property back from the party having right of possession without invoking court proceedings. The property may then be sold by either the financial institution or third party sellers.\n\nThe extent to which repossession is authorized, and how it may be executed, greatly varies in different jurisdictions - see below. When a lender cannot find the collateral, cannot peacefully obtain it through self-help repossession, or the jurisdiction does not allow self-help repossession, the alternative legal remedy to order the borrower to return the goods (prior to judgment) is replevin.\n\nThe security interest over the collateral is often known as a lien. The lender/creditor is known as the lienholder.\n\nThe existence and handling of repossessions varies greatly between jurisdictions. In most jurisdictions outside of the U.S., self-help is limited to real estate, and otherwise the right of possession can only be enforced by a court or other official agents.\n\nWhen a provision of law requires when repossession takes place, the lien holder has a \"non-delegatable\" obligation not to cause a \"Breach of the Peace\" (which is synonymous with disturbing the peace) in performing the repossession or the repossession will be reversed, and the party ordering the repossession will be liable for damages (or the lienholder will be held responsible). This requirement not to breach the peace includes even if the breach is caused by the debtor objecting to the repossession or resists the repossession. In \"MBank El Paso v. Sanchez\" (1992), 836 S.W.2d 151, where a repossession agent towed away a car even after the loanee locked herself in it, the court decided that this was an unlawful breach of the peace and declared the repossession invalid. The debtor was also awarded $1,200,000 in damages from the bank involved. Repossession also generally does not apply to real property. Real property is generally subject to a cause of action known as foreclosure.\n\nIn the United States, repossessions are carried out pursuant to state laws that permit a creditor with a security interest in goods to take possession of those goods if the debtor defaults under the contract that created the security interest. In particular, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have enacted (with minor variations) Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which generally permits security interest holders to repossess goods if a debtor is in default and the repossession can be conducted without a breach of the peace. Being \"in default\" means that the debtor has failed to fulfill his or her obligations under the contract. The most common forms of default resulting in repossession are failing to make required payments and failing to maintain adequate insurance coverage.\n\nMany U.S. states have enacted additional laws that apply specifically to the repossession of purchased and leased automobiles, and which are intended to afford additional consumer protections. Typical requirements include mandating that auto lenders provide consumers with opportunities to either \"reinstate\" or \"redeem\" their purchase or lease contracts after their vehicles have been repossessed. A \"reinstatement\" entails a consumer paying all of his or her past due amounts plus the creditor's repossession expenses, and then reacquiring the automobile as if the repossession had not occurred. A \"redemption\" entails the consumer paying off the entire contract balance and then being given ownership of the vehicle free and clear of any contract obligations. If these instances do not occur and the vehicle becomes repossessed, the lien holder is required to notify the debtor of their intent to sell the property. This is usually in the form of a letter that states that if the amount owed is not paid within ten business days, the entity officially takes ownership and may sell the property. \n\nSome consumers believe that they be legally entitled to a \"grace period\" that prevents creditors from repossessing goods until the payments are a certain number of days overdue. Actually grace periods are non-compulsory business practices that have been adopted by most consumer lenders through a term in the lending contract. There is nothing legally preventing a creditor with a security interest from repossessing the goods if a payment is late - even if it is only one day overdue - unless the lender has agreed otherwise as a binding term of contract. \n\nVarious objects can be repossessed, but most repossession agencies focus on car repossession. The repo agent normally uses a tow truck or pickup truck with a special towing attachment called a boom. They also may obtain the key from the car owner. The agent must be careful however, because they cannot cause physical harm to the vehicle. Usually, the vehicle owner must be notified of a repossession. The repossession agent will find the car and check its information such as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to make sure they have the right vehicle. If there is a match, they will attempt to hook up the car to the tow truck and tow it away or pick the lock and drive it away. However doing so does not absolve the repossession agent's requirement to be covered under an active insurance policy for the vehicle under the applicable criminal traffic laws. Thus, an agent who elects to do this may be subject to arrest for the violation of criminal traffic laws which apply to insurance requirements. The repo agents also cannot legally cross locked and enclosed storage spaces such as gates and garages. Repo agents also carry a massive amount of liability, so if they do not have all the proper insurances, the debtor will win a lawsuit. \n\nRepossession does not necessarily satisfy the loan. If the repossessor sells the asset for an appropriate amount, and if that amount is less than the amount of the loan, and if the repossessor sues the debtor for the balance (plus reasonable fees if applicable) in a timely manner, the debtor may be liable to pay the balance (sometimes called the \"deficiency\"). In this case the creditor will be liable for contributory negligence if the creditor auctions the property for less than applicable blue-book value. This is because such a failure directly contributes to any remaining deficiency. To avoid this liability, financial institutions will document a source (such as Kelley Blue Book or NADA) to price the collateral for sale. They will also document the condition of the vehicle to justify the sales price of it. \n\nWhether a debtor is actually liable for a balance depends on jurisdiction and on the details of the loan contract. In the case of a nonrecourse debt, for example, the debtor is not personally liable for a deficiency.\n\nReposession is only possible with Real estate. \n\nThese numbers and text relate to home mortgage repossessions in England.\n\nSource: Council of Mortgage Lenders and The Ministry of Justice.\n\nIn 2010, there looks to be a downtrend though, as lenders seized 9,400 properties in April, May and June, 400 fewer than in the first quarter of 2010, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).\n\nRepossession by self-help is generally illegal and constitutes theft. In most cases, if the debtor is unable or unwilling to pay an outstanding debt, the creditor must first obtain either a court order authorizing the repossession (\"Vollstreckungsbescheid\", only possible if the debtor does not contest the debt) or a regular court judgment. The debt must then be collected by an officer of the court (\"Gerichtsvollzieher\") who exclusively may use force to collect the debt, such as opening a door or enlisting help from police. Neither the creditor nor private debt collection agencies may use force or seize property against the will of the debtor.\n\nSpecific forms of self-help repossession for Real estate are legal. For example, a landlord may seize the tenant's property in a rented object if there are outstanding payments.\n\n\n"}

Lebedev Studio, a Russian design studio headed by Artemy Lebedev. Each of its keys is a display which can dynamically change to adapt to the keyboard layout in use or to show the function of the key. It was launched initially in 2008 and is no longer available to new orders.\n\nThe design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on Slashdot on July 14, 2005, and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was \"end of 2006\", however production issues caused the Optimus mini three to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the \"Wired Magazine\" 2006 Vaporware Awards and number 4 on the list in 2007 due to its numerous delays and feature reductions.\n\nThe Optimus allows for greater user interaction, by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the shift key, the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as English and Cyrillic) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as Dvorak easier for people who only have a QWERTY keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for \"Quake III Arena\" and Adobe Photoshop.\n\nA patent application filed on March 13, 2007 suggests that Apple Inc. may be working on a similar dynamically changeable organic light-emitting diode (OLED) keyboard.\n\nArt. Lebedev Studio released a smaller three-key version of their keyboard, named Optimus mini three. Each of the keys is larger than a standard key. The mini three can be adjusted, through the configuration software, to either a horizontal or vertical orientation.\n\nInitial reviews were mixed. The keyboard functions as advertised, but it has been criticized for inordinately high CPU usage, slow response time, and buggy configuration software.\n\nOn July 21, 2008, Engadget posted about a new version of the keyboard, originally named Optimus Pultius. It features 15 OLED keys in a three-by-five arrangement and a USB port. Engadget also reported that the Pultius had been renamed to the Aux and included a new rendering of the rear side showing that there would be two USB ports instead of one.\n\nIn 2014, the existing models in the Optimus range were discontinued and superseded by the \"Optimus Popularis\" model which uses a single large LCD screen under the transparent keyboard instead of individual OLED displays for each key.\n\nThe patent for this \"Display Keyboard\" (, filed 1996, published 1998) is held by inventor Elkin Acevedo. However, the first programmable LCD keyboard was developed in the mid-1980s in Germany. This keyboard, sold under the LCBoard name in the U.S. until 1999, contained many of the features of the Optimus keyboard including monochrome graphic icons on each keyboard key, macro programming, context sensitive and application dependent switching between functions. S. Bigbie et. al. published related ideas in an IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin (Vol. 21 No. 2 July 1978) , as did Alan Bagley of Hewlett-Packard in ().\n\nE Ink technology has been used in a product by Sonder Design. \n\nA concept design using E Ink technology was created by Maxim Mezentsev and Aleksander Suhih in 2013. A similar design by Jaasta was also created in 2014 but was never built since they used Sonder Design's prior art.\n\nArt. Lebedev Studio manufactured the keyboard with these features:\n\nThe keyboard’s full name relates to Jupiter Optimus Maximus (\"Father God the Best and Greatest\"), the full name of Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology.\n\nEngadget published an early impression of the keyboard, approving of the quality of the displays, the build quality of the keyboard, and the customisation software. However, they note that the keys' high resistance means that it is tiring to type on (exhausting the author in \"30 seconds to a minute\"), and therefore \"it's better off used as an absurdly configurable Swiss army knife\".\n\nOther reviewers felt that whilst the keyboard performed well, the high purchase price was not justified.\n\n"}

{"id": "2301706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301706", "title": "Albert Chevalier", "text": "Albert Chevalier\n\nAlbert Chevalier born Albert Onésime Britannicus Gwathveoyd Louis Chevalier; (21 March 186110 July 1923), was an English music hall comedian, singer and musical theatre actor. He specialised in cockney related humour based on life as a costermonger in London during the Victorian era. Owing to this and his ability to write songs, he became known to his audiences as the \"costers' laureate\".\n\nBorn in London, Chevalier showed an interest in entertainment from an early age through his private performances to family and friends. He made his debut on the amateur stage when he was eight, performing in \"Julius Caesar\", at the local Cornwall Hall. Soon after he joined a local amateur dramatics group before changing his stage name to \"Albert Knight\".\n\nChevalier joined the music hall circuit in the 1880s and over the decade became very successful. His success meant that from the early 1890s he was able to choose which theatres to perform in and often performing at three or four halls each night. Together with his brother Charles Ingle he wrote a number of highly successful coster songs to support his act including \"Wot cher!, or, Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\", \"The Future Mrs. 'Awkins\", \"Appy 'Ampstead\", and the melodrama \"My Old Dutch\". As well as in London, Chevalier became popular with audiences in the English provinces which he toured over the length of his career.\n\nDuring the 1910s Chevalier moved from comedy into music composition for straight plays. With a deteriorating health his final appearance was in \"My Old Dutch\" at the Lyceum Theatre in 1920. The play was based on Chevalier's own song of the same name and had some success. The play ran for over a year and Chevalier completed his last performance in November 1922. He died aged 62 and was buried in Abney Park cemetery in the same plot as his son and father-in-law George Leybourne.\n\nChevalier was born Albert Onesime Britannicus Gwathveoyd Louis Chevalier, at 21 St Anne's Villas, Royal Crescent, London. The son of Jean Onésime Chevalier, a French master at Kensington School, and his Welsh wife, Ellen Louisa Mathews; he had five siblings, two of whom died in infancy. His surviving brothers were Bertram, who in later life became a freelance photographer, and Auguste, who was better known as Charles Ingle, a composer of music hall songs. Chevalier was educated at Clanricarde College, Bayswater, and later, St Mary's College, Richmond. From a young age he showed an interest in acting and privately performed scenes from \"The September Gale\" for his family when he was eight years old.\n\nIn 1869 Chevalier made his amateur debut on the stage performing as Mark Anthony in Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", at Cornwall Hall in Notting Hill. A year later, on 17 August, and at the same venue, he performed some minor scenes from \"The September Gale\", this time to a paying audience. When he was 14 he joined a local amateur dramatics group called the Roscius Dramatic Club, where he adopted the stage name, Albert Knight. When he left education, and to pay his drama fees, Chevalier took up a position as a clerk in a newspaper office, and then as a pupil teacher. It was in that job that his father introduced him to the playwright Dion Boucicault who arranged for a friend to mentor Chevalier's start in the theatre.\n\nIn 1876 Chevalier organised two amateur performances of \"The Quack Doctor\" and \"Handy Andy\" both of which he produced and starred in. In 1877 Chevalier was engaged as an actor under the Bancrofts in London, and for some years played \"legitimate\" parts at the Court theatre and elsewhere. Chevalier's first professional appearance was alongside Madge Kendal and her husband William in \"An Unequal Match\" at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, London, on 29 September 1877; Chevalier appeared in the piece under his chosen stage name, Albert Knight. The following year the Kendals engaged him to play the part of \"Sam Winkle\" in the drama \"The Omadhaun Witness\" and then in a small role in the comic farce \"Checkmate\".\n\nThe following January, and owing to Arthur Cecil's introduction of him to the Kendals, the show's producers, Chevalier toured for the first time in the highly successful melodrama \"Diplomacy\" in which he took the small role of \"Antoine\"; midway through the tour, Chevalier decided to change his stage name to his real moniker. The provincial press were complimentary of the show and singled out Chevalier in particular for his role. A critic for the \"Edinburgh Daily Review\" noted that although his part was small, \"Mr. Chevalier's Antoine should be praised\", while a theatre reviewer from the \"Liverpool Daily Post\" commented \"The Parisian quaintness of Antoine, the \"major domo of the Parisian ménage is exactly hit off by Mr. Chevalier.\"\n\nChevalier remained until the end of the tour, after which he was engaged to appear at the Court Theatre, London in the comedy \"A Scrap of Paper\" in which he played the role of \"Jones\". The show opened on 6 January 1879 and was, according to Chavalier's biographer Brian Daley, \"met with unquestioned success\". The following month he took a minor part in \"The Ladies Battle\" in which he took the role of \"Montrichard\", a characterisation which Daley describes as being \"inimitable\". Through the summer of 1879 he undertook a series of small roles for the Kendals in Liverpool. Towards the end of that year he was chosen by the Kendals to understudy for the main actors in the short plays \"M. le Duc\", \"The Queen's Shilling\" and \"A Regular Fix\".\n\nIn February 1881 Chevalier was chosen to form part of a touring company headed by the cellist and composer Auguste van Biene on a provincial tour of England. The classical plays, \"La Somnambula\" and \"The Grand Duchess\" were unsuccessful and the company were forced to raise funds by staging small concerts in rundown theatres in nearby towns. It was Chevalier's job to sing comic-songs, accompanied by a backdrop of classical music. They were booed and hissed from the audience who were leaving the hall rapidly. At the last minute Chevalier stepped in and performed a short ditty as \"Sammy Stammers\" which, as the title suggests, was a character with a stutter who sang comic songs. The audience believed his affliction and ridiculed him as they left. Unperturbed, van Biene staged \"Don Giovanni\" the following night, but the lead singer failed to show. Chevalier offered his services to van Biene and assumed the role with the added promise that he could make the show his own. During a break, Chevalier borrowed a box of props from the storeroom and went back on to impersonate the music hall star George H. Chirgwin. The show went well and he stayed with the company for the remainder of the tour.\n\nA few months later Chevalier was recruited for a short tour of Scotland. Among the places he visited were Glasgow, Coatbridge and Greenock the latter in which he enjoyed much success in the burlesques \"False Glitter\" and the show's after piece, \"Peebles\".\n\nChevalier was engaged to appear in Arthur Pinero's \"The Magistrate\" in 1885 and \"The Schoolmistress\" the following year. In 1889 he became the principal comedian at the Avenue Theatre, predominantly in burlesques. Throughout the 1880s he was a prolific writer of songs, including \"Our 'armonic Club\", which was written for the burlesque \"Aladdin, or, The Wonderful Scamp\" in around 1888.\n\nOn 5 February 1891 Chevalier appeared for the first time on the music hall stage at the New London Pavilion, Piccadilly Circus. For his costume, Chevalier opted for a peaked cap, a check jacket, a necktie, and a pair of bell-bottomed trousers. In preparation, he sought advice from Marie Lloyd, an already established music hall singer in her own right and who formed part of the audience on his opening night. Also in the auditorium was a curious Lewis Carroll, a staunch opposer of music hall entertainment, who had come to hear about Chevalier's debut through friends. Carroll had earlier been impressed by Chevalier's performances in the straight theatre. Writing in his memoirs, Carroll thought was \"decidedly good as an actor; but as a comic singer (with considerable powers of pathos as well), he [was] quite first rate.\"\n\nHe appeared in character as a costermonger, and sang \"The Coster's Serenade\", \"The Nasty Way 'e Sez It\", and \"Funny Without Being Vulgar\".\n\nChevalier based his act upon the performances of Alfred Vance, a cockney comedian from the beginnings of the English music hall tradition. Chevalier also drew inspiration from the London characters of Charles Dickens, including Sam Weller, whom Chevalier had played unsuccessfully in a touring show. For the tour, he updated the character by modernising the dialogue and mixing it with the performance style used by mid-century cockney performers, including Vance. The changes resulted in Chevalier inventing a new, sentimental variation of Vance's \"criminal coster\", which was loosely based on a working-class Londoner.\n\nChevalier's failure in the theatre was instrumental in his decision to start performing in music hall. The move into music hall was considered by some critics to be unusual for an actor in legitimate theatre, but it was welcomed by music hall syndicates who were eager to appeal to as many different audiences as they could. Chevalier justified his move by arguing that audiences were ready for something different and benefitted from support by George Bernard Shaw and the poet Arthur Symons.\nFrom the early 1890s Chevalier agreed to only work in the major London music-halls, which he did for over a seven-year period, often performing at three or four halls each night. Together with his brother Charles he wrote a number of highly successful coster songs including \"Wot cher!, or, Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\", \"The Future Mrs. 'Awkins\", \"Appy 'Ampstead\", and the melodrama \"My Old Dutch\". As well as in London, Chevalier appeared in various concert halls throughout the English provinces, as he refused to appear in music halls outside of the capital.\n\nDuring the 1890s, Chevalier became a highly popular performer on the music hall stage, rivalled only by Dan Leno, whose comedy act was based much more on gritty working-class realism than Chevalier's aspirational romanticism.\n\nIn 1893 Chevalier undertook managerial responsibilities at the Trocadero Music Hall; the venture proved disastrous, and left him with a £10,000 debt. On 8 October 1894 he married Florence Isabel Leybourne (b. 1868/9) who was the daughter of the music hall performer George Leybourne; they had no children. Chevalier travelled to New York in 1896 where he repeated his success at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Despite suffering stage fright, the appearance was a success for the comedian, and he was hailed as one of the city's idols.\n\nUpon his return from America and Canada in 1896, Chevalier decided to reduce his music hall appearances owing to the unpredictability and inattentiveness of the genre's audiences, which he came to dislike. From the paying public's point of view, his style of humour had become common place within the music hall. His biggest rival was Gus Elen who had developed a more complex and comical alternative to Chevalier's. Instead, Chevalier decided to concentrate his time on creating comic characters which he used in one-man sketches which he called his \"recitals\". To keep within the audiences gaze, he still performed occasional coster songs and performed them alongside his characterisations. The characters included a country vicar in \"Our Bazaar\", a struggling actor in \"A Fallen Star\", and a west-country peasant in \"E Can't Take a Roise out of oi\". While none of these pieces earned the kind of success that his coster songs had achieved, Chevalier maintained a successful solo career performing them. His annual engagement at the Queen's Hall in London of twice-daily performances began in 1899 and ran in excess of 1000 performances.\n\nChevalier returned to America in 1906 for a six-week tour with the French singer Yvette Guilbert who described her co-star as being \"more skilful than actually talented\". During the 1900s he became one of the highest paid music hall stars in London, earning up to £450 per week. He played the title role in J. M. Barrie's Pantaloon (1906) and in the same year appeared with the French chanteuse Yvette Guilbert.\n\nChevalier continued to compose songs and perform in straight plays. His final appearance was at the Lyceum Theatre in 1920 in \"My Old Dutch\", which Chevalier co-wrote with Arthur Shirley. The play was based on Chevalier's own song of the same name and had some success despite, according to the biographer Simon Featherstone, its by then \"dated sentimentality\". The play ran for over a year and Chevalier completed his last performance in November 1922.\n\nChevalier died on 10 July 1923 at his home, Lake House, at 38 Woodberry Down, Stoke Newington. He was buried in Abney Park Cemetery on 13 July in the same plot as his son and father-in-law George Leybourne. He was survived by his wife.\n\nAlbert Chevalier was in some ways an innovative popular performer who established the coster style of performance, wrote his own material, and exploited the commercial opportunities of the developing music-halls in the 1890s. He made commercial recordings of his songs, and appeared in several early films, including the 1915 British silent \"My Old Dutch\".\n\nThe English theatre critic Clement Scott noted Chevalier for his ability to interact with his audiences on a working class level and to modernise the music hall: \"Albert Chevalier has had much – very much – to do with the wholesome reform of the modern music hall. An artist by instinct, he left the stage and, with laudable courage, he gave his talent to the common people. He understood that there was a warm heart under a corduroy jacket, a vein of sentiment even in the lowly costermonger and he gave us the ballads which are now household words.\" The writer Richard Anthony Baker highlighted the \"snobbery\" of some theatre critics who thought that music hall entertainment was \"innately inferior to the legitimate theatre\". However, Baker opined that although Chevalier was an \"entertainer and lyricist of considerable talent\", the sentimentality of his act would, when compared to modern entertainment, be thought of as outdated.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301720", "title": "Kinsey Millhone", "text": "Kinsey Millhone\n\nKinsey Millhone is a fictional character who was created by American author Sue Grafton (1940–2017) for her \"alphabet mysteries\" series of best-selling novels which debuted in 1982 and feature 25 volumes. Millhone, a former police officer turned private investigator, also appears in a number of short stories written by Grafton.\n\nGrafton's mystery novels featuring Millhone are set in 1980s Santa Teresa, a fictionalized town based on Santa Barbara, California.\n\nThe fictional character Kinsey Millhone was born on May 5, 1950. Her unusual first name was the maiden name of her mother, wealthy debutante Rita Cynthia Kinsey, who married Kinsey's father, Randy Millhone, against the wishes of Kinsey's grandmother, Cornelia LaGrand Kinsey (Grand), causing a family rift. Kinsey's parents were killed in a car wreck when she was five; Kinsey was trapped in the car with her dead parents for several hours before she was rescued, retaining only the memory of her mother weeping softly before her death. She then moved in with her mother’s sister Virginia (Aunt Gin), the only relative to side with Rita in the family rift, although Kinsey later finds out her parents were en route to a bridge-building family visit when the accident occurred. From her Aunt Gin, Kinsey acquired various eccentricities, including a liking for peanut-butter and pickle sandwiches. In high school, Kinsey was a self-described pot-smoking delinquent. After three semesters at the local community college she realized that academic life was not for her and she joined the Santa Teresa police force. After two years, Kinsey decided life in uniform wasn't for her, either, and quit the police force to become an investigator for California Fidelity, an insurance company, where Aunt Gin had worked. Eventually, she became a self-employed private investigator, initially mentored by local PI Benjamin Byrd, who had been a partner of another local PI, Morley Shine, before striking out on her own, solving various disappearances and murders, clearing names and dodging hitmen. For some years she maintained a loose relationship with CFI, then rented premises in the offices of her lawyer, Lonnie Kingman, before renting independent office space in later years. She has an antagonistic relationship with local policeman Con Dolan, although this mellowed into a reasonably amicable truce after Dolan's retirement and they have co-operated on more than one recent case.\n\nKinsey is 5'6\" tall, and weighs about 118 pounds. She has short, dark, thick hair that she trims with nail scissors, being generally uninterested in her physical appearance. She is, however, very particular about her teeth, and even mentions other people's good teeth (especially men to whom she might be attracted). Her wardrobe consists mostly of jeans and turtleneck sweaters, though she also owns an extremely wrinkle-resistant \"little black dress\" for those occasions when dressing up is unavoidable. She does, however, place a great premium on physical fitness and jogs three miles every weekday. At the same time, she has a \"penchant for junk food.\" She also suffers from tinnitus, caused when she shot an attacker from inside a trash can. Kinsey has been divorced twice. Her first husband, Mickey, an ex-cop, appears in \"O is for Outlaw\". Her second husband, Daniel, a struggling musician, appears in \"E is for Evidence\", where he is revealed to be attracted to men. In most ways, Kinsey is a loner. She has no children and lives in an extremely compact studio apartment converted from a single-car garage. Her landlord is a young-at-heart octogenarian, Henry Pitts, a retired commercial baker who enjoys creating crossword puzzles; Kinsey admits to having a crush on Henry, but also says he is the closest thing she will have to a father. Henry's family is long-lived, his siblings all being well into their 90s. When not dining on fast food, Kinsey eats regularly at a local tavern, run by flamboyant Hungarian Rosie, who, in the course of the stories, marries Henry's hypochondriac brother, William.\n\nKinsey has had several relationships in the series, beginning with Charlie Scorsoni, then Jonah Robb, a police officer, and Robert Dietz, another private eye, until the later novels in which she began an affair with longtime friend Cheney Phillips, a police detective. Kinsey remains friends with Cheney after their split, as she did for a while with Jonah, though Jonah slowly drops out of her life after patching up his on-off marriage. Dietz on the other hand loses touch with her completely, returning briefly in \"M is for Malice\", although Kinsey still thinks of him occasionally.\n\nHaving lived for most of her life with very few family members (for most of the series, her \"family\" consisted of Henry and his siblings, Rosie, and the generous-natured employees in nearby offices), Kinsey received a shock when she found out about the Kinsey clan. When she met cousins Tasha and Lisa, she realized the three are very similar in appearance. Kinsey and Tasha formed a business relationship in \"M Is for Malice\" and Kinsey was instinctively attached to Tasha's mother, her aunt Susanna, when they met. However, she has remained reluctant to become involved with her new-found family, feeling that they abandoned her when she was orphaned. However, in \"U is for Undertow\" she discovers that her grandmother made strenuous efforts to foster her after the accident, which Aunt Gin concealed from Kinsey. Kinsey finally agreed to meet Grand at a family event where her grandmother, now very frail, mistook her for her mother.\n\nWhen asked about the title of book 24, Grafton told the \"Minneapolis Star-Tribune\" that the title \"almost has to be Xenophobe or Xenophobia. I've checked the penal codes in most states and xylophone isn't a crime, so I'm stuck.\" Ultimately, Grafton broke the usual title pattern, naming the 24th book simply \"\"X\"\".\n\nGrafton had planned the twenty-sixth and final book in the series, titled \"\"Z\" Is for Zero\", to be released in 2019. On Grafton's death in 2017, her daughter indicated that the final installment was unwritten and the family would not hire a ghostwriter, stating that \"as far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y.\"\n\nAccording to Grafton, the 1981 book \"Telling Lies for Fun and Profit\" by prolific author Lawrence Block was her main creative guide during the \"early years\" of the Millhone novels. She re-read Block's advice book cover-to-cover before starting a new Millhone novel, and also wrote a new introduction for the 1994 reprint.\n\n\nKinsey Millhone is featured in cameo appearances in crime novels by other authors. Bill Pronzini and Marcia Muller have their fictional detective spot Millhone at a convention in Chicago. Sara Paretsky has her sleuth V.I. Warshawski envy Millhone's organization. Kinsey also makes a cameo appearance in \"The Sultan of Byzantium\" by Selçuk Altun. As the story takes place in 2012, Kinsey is described: \"As if her worn-out jeans and faded rose-colored t-shirt weren't enough, she made no attempt to hide the gray in her hair...she looked a little over fifty but didn't seem to care about that.\"\n"}

She has also appeared in other media related to the series, including animated films and comics. The character has received positive reception and was noted by some as epitomizing racial diversity in fighting games.\n\nMichelle debuted in the \"Tekken\" series at the age of 18, which, alongside Anna Williams, made her the youngest human character to debut in the series until Ling Xiaoyu, who debuted in \"Tekken 3\" at the age of 16. She is 20 years old in \"Tekken 2\" and chronologically would be 41 as of \"Tekken 6\"; however, due to her never making a canonical appearance since \"Tekken 2\" (aside from a cameo in her daughter Julia's ending in \"Tekken 3\"), she appeared in \"Tekken Tag Tournament\" and \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\" in her \"Tekken 2\" appearance, making her physically comparable to her daughter, Julia, who too appeared in both games and is around 20 years of age as of \"Tekken 7\".\n\nDuring an early development of \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", some of Michelle's motion capture was done by the series producer Katsuhiro Harada. On Twitter, Harada complained about the \"spam\" from fans demanding to bring back Michelle and Jun Kazama, even after they were both confirmed to return in this game.\n\nMichelle utilized a variation of Kenpo called \"Chang kenpo\" mixed with xingyiquan. She shared many moves with Wang Jinrei, who too practiced xingyiquan. Her style and moveset were later adopted by her adopted daughter and substitute in the series, Julia. She still used the same fighting style in \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", but she gained several unique moves to differentiate herself from both Wang and Julia.\n\nAccording to Prima Games' guide to the original \"Tekken\", \"though she does not have the awesome power of the heavy hitters, Michelle can tear through her enemies with fast counters and spectacular juggles. Michelle is next to unbeatable once you have mastered her ability to evade attacks and counter with lingering juggles.\" Similarly, a \"Hyper\" guide to \"Tekken 2\" states that Michelle was often underestimated due to her lack of flashy moves, but for those who learned using her properly she could become one the most deadly character in the game. In \"Tekken Tag Tournament\", Michelle is extremely fast; she is supposed to be played very aggressively as her combos hit all levels, causing problems for the opponents to block them all. She is also able to perform devastating counters and has a large number of moves that can start juggle combos. However, she can be a very difficult character to play.\n\nMichelle Chang is a Chinese-Native American woman (her father was from Hong Kong and her mother is a Native American from Arizona) and the foster mother of Julia Chang. Michelle's father had been ordered by Heihachi to search for an ancient treasure of the Native Americans; a pendant allegedly capable of controlling powerful spirits, which is owned by Michelle. When he failed to retrieve it for Heihachi, the latter ordered his men to murder him. This fact is presented by Michelle's mother when she turns eighteen; she thus sets out to enter The King of Iron Fist Tournament in order to take revenge against Heihachi. Michelle encounters and defeats Kunimitsu, a female ninja treasure hunter that was seeking the pendant, and secures the amulet. She promptly withdraws from the tournament; as she has achieved what she then realises should have been her main goal, and although she does not win the tournament, Michelle is still satisfied that another fighter (Kazuya Mishima) defeated Heihachi.\n\nIn \"Tekken 2\", Michelle's mother has been kidnapped by Ganryu, who is working for Kazuya, who desires the pendant. She has entered the tournament to rescue her mother. Michelle meets Ganryu and battles him. After defeating Ganryu, she rescues her mother and returns home. However, unknown to her, Ganryu has fallen in love with her.\n\nA couple of years later, Michelle discovers an abandoned baby girl nearby her village. She adopts the infant, names her Julia, and loves her as if she were her own daughter. When Julia grows into a teenager, Michelle teaches her Chinese martial arts such as xingyiquan. Michelle's tribe grow worried when various martial artists around the world disappeared, allegedly because of the awakening of Ogre, whose legends have been passed on within the tribe. They fear that Michelle's pendant is the suspect. Michelle departs for Japan to ask Heihachi why he sought her pendant before, but she fails to return. Julia has entered the tournament to rescue her mother. She appears in Julia's ending, being reunited with her adopted daughter. Her further fate has never been canonically resolved within the games.\n\nShe appears as a playable character in \"Tekken Tag Tournament\" and is one of the console-exclusive returning characters via free downloadable content (DLC) in \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\" (first introduced as pre-order bonus from GameStop). In her \"TTT2\" ending movie, Michelle dons a mask to team-up with Jaycee (Julia) in lucha libre professional wrestling.\n\nMichelle appears in the anime film \"\" with a bigger role than most of the other contenders. Before the tournament, she attempts to kill Heihachi with a tomahawk, but Heihachi breaks the axe with his teeth and welcomes Michelle's challenge if she makes it to the tower. Michelle encounters and defeats Ganryu, but is beaten by Kazuya to the point that she begs him to let her face Heihachi and take revenge for Heihachi burning down her village and inadvertently killing \"both\" her parents. Kazuya, knowing that Michelle will be killed, refuses. Michelle continues to attack Kazuya relentlessly until he beats her into submission and nearly mercy-kills her, but is stopped by Jun's intervention. She is later found and rescued from the crumbling island by Paul Phoenix. She is voiced by Narumi Hidaka in the original Japanese version and by Jessica Robertson in the English dub. Michelle also appears in the comics \"Tekken Saga\", \"Tekken 2\", \"Tekken: Tatakai no Kanatani\", and \"Tekken Forever\".\n\nAccording to Liz Faber's book \"Computer Game Graphics\" (1999), \"Michelle Chan, a 'superbabe' who cuts a nice line in denim hot-pants in \"Tekken\" epitomizes the racially diverse characters that populate the modern [video] games.\" \"The New York Times\" \"Game Theory\" columnist JC Herz claimed that Michelle, having an Asian name but ambiguous features, is \"such a confused mixture of signs\" that she \"represents a perfect metaphor of video games themselves.\"\n\nA 1997 article in \"Game On! USA\", highlighted her, Chun Li, Mai Shiranui, and Jill Valentine as the female \"video game characters who have marked the near absurd level of popularity.\" In 2008, \"FHM\" listed Michelle as one of the \"female vixens that are equally tough and certainly hot\", representing \"Tekken\" along with Nina Williams and Christie Monteiro. \"Complex\" featured Michelle among the 50 \"hottest women in video games\" in 2010, and ranked her as the 13th \"best looking sideline chick in games\" in 2011.\n\nAndrew Bridgman from Dorkly listed her as one of the most stereotypical Native American characters in fighting game history, ranking her at seventh place, tying with her daughter Julia. Andrew Rivera from \"Complex\" compared her to the \"Street Fighter\" series character T. Hawk. In an official poll by Namco, Michelle was the 26th most requested \"Tekken\" character to be added to the roster of \"Tekken X Street Fighter\".\n\n"}

She is left nameless in Chrétien's unfinished romance, but Wolfram von Eschenbach, who reworked the tale for the German epic \"Parzival\", calls her Orgeluse (taken from \"rguilleuse\", the Old French word for \"proud\").\n\nIn Chrétien's work, Gawain meets the Haughty Maiden while travelling; she treats him with contempt and scorn. Despite her humiliating treatment, Gawain acts with unfailing courtesy towards her, accepting her insults with grace.\n\nFollowing her instructions to search for a nearby castle by a ford, Gawain encounters a knight who tells him that he is either very brave or foolish, for everyone who has tried to cross the perilous ford between them had drowned. Gawain realises the damsel had tried to do away with him. The knight offers to lead Gawain to a bridge, but the hero chooses to jump the ford on his horse Gringolet. He fails once, but succeeds the second time, and when he returns to the Haughty Maiden, she finally gives in and asks for forgiveness for treating him so poorly. She explains that her attitude was the result of tragic circumstances; the knight Guiromelant tried to win her love by killing her first suitor in single combat. Gawain sets off to avenge the fallen knight, but matters are complicated when Guiromelant reveals his love for Gawain's sister. The poem breaks off before the matter is resolved, though a later author tied up some of the loose threads in the First Continuation of \"Perceval\".\n\nWolfram expands the story and brings it to completion. He explains that the Wounded King Anfortas had been injured fighting for Orgeluse, and was now waiting for Parzival (Percival) to heal him. Gawain and Orgeluse express their love for each other, and eventually peace is made between the lady and Guiromelant. Orgeluse marries Gawain while Guiromelant marries the champion's sister.\n"}

{"id": "2301726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301726", "title": "Arcanis", "text": "Arcanis\n\nArcanis was originally a campaign setting for the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game, created by Henry Lopez and supported by Paradigm Concepts. It is also the name of the fictional world where the setting takes place. The setting was launched in 2001 and is known for its odd twists on the fantasy genre, as well as its wide member approval and community-based design and construction. Unlike many other fantasy roleplaying games, which focus primarily on tactical combat, the Arcanis campaigns focus on moral ambiguity and politics.\n\nWhile originally launched as a d20srd title, Arcanis was relaunched in 2011 with a unique rules set as detailed in Paradigm Concepts. This system uses a similar initiative system to \"Feng Shui\"; a progressive clock system of initiative, with each action taking a specific number of 'ticks' of a clock rather than simply having everyone go in a predetermined order.\n\nArcanis is set on the continent of Onara, where a crumbling Coryani Empire (reminiscent of the Western Roman Empire) struggles with newly created nations such as Milandir (reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire) or Canceri (reminiscent of Russia during the Middle Ages and the Balkans).\n\nThe playable Races in Arcanis differ from the traditional races in other \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign settings. There are seven primary races: Dark-kin (infernally tainted), Dwarves (cursed Giants), Elorii (basically Elves, but with some significant differences), Gnomes (offspring of a human and a dwarf), Humans (including the elementally attuned Kio and Undir), Ss'ressen (Lizard-folk), and Val (touched by the gods with different bloodlines depending on which God was their progenitor). While in the days of the d20srd rules other playable races were allowed—such as Half-Orcs—the most recent Arcanis RPG rules have streamlined the system somewhat to remove these hold-overs from \"Dungeons & Dragons\".\n\nDark-kin are those born with demonic traits. They are usually born from human parents who carry recessive demonic traits. Because of their bloodlines, Dark-kin tend to be marginalized in society. Dark-kin are the results of a period of Onara's history called the Time of Terror, when Demons, Devils, and other Infernals were released from the Hells by the powerful magics of the Myrantian Empire.\n\nGiants were assigned the task of protecting mankind. When they began to lord over man, the king of the gods, Illiir cursed the giants, diminishing them into dwarves. Later, Sarish, the grandson of Illiir and the God of Contracts came to the Dwarves and told them that should they craft the perfect item, their curse would be lifted.\n\nThe Dwarves are divided into different groups, called Enclaves. Unlike other humanoids on Onara, dwarves are barred from the afterlife due to their curse. To preserve their souls, each Dwarf carries with him a gem, known as Soul Stone to which their soul is trapped following their death, to be released when the Curse has been lifted.\n\nElves in Arcanis are called Elorii. Made of the traditional Greek elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, the Elorii are immortal. Elorii are divided into different subraces based on their elemental ancestry, adding another subrace known as the Life Elorii, or Ardekenes.\n\nThe Elorii were created by four very powerful elementals in conjunction with a \"life spirit\" called Belisarda, who imbued elemental energies and life force into bioconstructed orc-like creature known as a Gar. Because of this, Elorii do not look like traditional Elves, having distinct fangs as well as other minor differences. These elemental spirits were worshipped by the Elorii as gods; they despise humanity because four of the human gods \"absorbed\" the four Elemental Lords, leaving only Belisarda. They eventually rebelled against their creators.\n\nGnomes in Arcanis are ugly, short half-breeds. These Gnomes are not an independent race, but are considered an 'aberration' race, resulting from the unholy breeding between Dwarves and Humans. Gnomes in Arcanis are disgustingly deformed, as the curse applied to dwarves applies equally to the stature of their offspring. However, unlike their Dwarven parents, Gnomes are not barred from the afterlife.\n\nHumans mirror the traditional \"Dungeons & Dragons\" human. Most of humanity are latecomers to the continent of Onara (where most of the current story takes place), but at least one group, the Pengik, predate the Ss'regorean Empire, who have the oldest recorded history. Presently, there are two notable variations of Humanity: The Kio and the Undir. These subraces of Human have been attuned to the elements of air and water, respectively, and display several differences including longer life (Kio) and more elven traits (Undir).\n\nSs'ressen are lizard-men and a major component of the Ssethregoran Empire. This empire consists of many races, many of them serpentine such as Naga and Ssanu snake-men (who replaced the Yuan-ti after the latter were removed from the Open Gaming License content). The Ssethregorans are the oldest civilized group on the continent of Onara and at one point had conquered most of it. They are well known for their strange magics and were responsible for the creation of the Elorii. Originally, they worshiped the gods Kassegore and Yig, but with the rise of the Naga to a ruling position, they now worship vile gods known as the Varn. (Originally, they worshiped slaadi, but with the removal of these beings from the Open Gaming License content, Paradigm Concepts was forced to change this.)\n\nThe Black Talon ss'ressen rebelled against the Ssethregoran Empire and fled. They had come to worship a god known as The Fire Dragon. They live in a swampy area of the nation of Milandir. The Ghost Scale are descendants of a splinter group of Black Talons who came upon an artifact in the sewers of Grand Coryan that radiates a magical aura (which so happens to also radiate heat enough to support a ss'eressen clutch) and took to worshiping it as a god by the name of Herka. The Ashen Hide ss'ressen broke off from the Black Talons, deciding that the Fire Dragon was actually the human god of fire and war, Nier. The Ashen Hide Clutch now resides in the nation of Canceri.\n\nVal were created during the God War as the elite warriors of the Gods and thereafter, as the caretakers of Mankind. In their stead, every god sent his servants, the Valinor, to mingle with the populace, and create a semi-divine family capable of aiding mankind. Every Val has a bloodline, which is tied to a specific god; they have divine powers which they may improve; these are related to their bloodline. For example, val'Ossan are tied to Yarris, god of the sea, and can gain Bloodline Powers such as walking on water and controlling sea creatures.\n\nVal are also the only psionic humans in Arcanis. Val always have steel grey eyes, unless they are psionically active; in psions, the iris turns clear, leaving the eye almost entirely white.\n\nThe nations of Arcanis are mostly human affairs, all related to the First Imperium that fell thousands of years ago; most of these are ruled by the Val.\nThe primary human lands are:\n\nThe three Elorii Nations are:\n\nThe major Dwarven Enclaves are:\n\nThere are three major clutches of Ss'ressen (outside of the Ssethregoran Empire), the second two being offshoots of the first:\n\nThe other races are mostly outcasts and wanderers, though occasionally small racial enclaves arise in larger cities, rather than maintaining organized civilizations.\n\nThe Deities of Arcanis are sectioned off into different pantheons. The main pantheon is the Pantheon of Man, housing the human gods. Other pantheons such as the Pantheon of the Elves, are broken, or destroyed leaving only one or no gods behind.\n\nIn Arcanis, \"true\" gods are unconcerned with petty mortal morality, so have no alignment as gods in other settings do; only churches have alignment, depending on what aspects of a god they worship. The Pantheon of Man, for example, does not have alignment, but the Sethregoran Varn Gods do.\n\nThe foundation of the pantheon are three brother gods: \"Illiir\", the Patron God of Emperors and Order, Sun God and Head of the Pantheon; \"Yarris\", God of the Sea; and \"Neroth\", God of Death. Further, three Goddesses are their sisters and in some cases consorts: \"Saluwé\", Goddess of the Earth, consort of Illiir; \"Beltine\", Goddess of the Soul, wife of Neroth; and \"Anshar\", Goddess of Pain and Suffering. The children of Illiir and Saluwé are \"Hurrian\", God of Storms and Honorable Combat, the Reluctant Warrior, \"Nier\", God of Fire, War and Slaughter, and \"Larissa\", Oracle of the Gods and (more recently) Goddess of Pleasure. The child of Neroth and Beltine is \"Cadic\", the God of Shadows, Murder, and Music. Larissa and Cadic have a son named \"Sarish\", God of Oaths and Binding of Demons. There is reference to \"Althares\", God of Knowledge, Invention, and Artifice, as being the \"Grand Uncle of Sarish,\" but exactly where he fits into the divine family tree is unclear.\n\nThe Mother Church of the Pantheon of Man once held all the gods in equal worship, until a schism occurred which drove followers of Neroth, Sarish and Nier to form an independent church, the Dark Triumvirate in Canceri. The Mother Church and the Dark Triumvirate differ in several ways, primarily in that the Dark Triumvirate approves of activities the Mother Church fears: the creation of Undead and the summoning of demons and devils for the most part.\n\nThe Fire Dragon is the god worshiped by the Black Talon ss'ressen. The Ashen Hide split off from this group, believing that Fire Dragon was actually the human god, Nier.\n\nThe Ssethregoran Empire once worshiped the gods Kassegore and Yig. With the ascension of the Naga to a ruling position in the Empire, they have begun to worship a pantheon of beings from another plane known as the Varn.\n\nThe Elorii follow the Elemental Lords that created them, despite the destruction of four of them. The remaining Elemental Lord, the life spirit Belisarda, was believed to have been destroyed by The Other (or Umor, as the Elorii knew him), until the arrival of a Prophet who claimed this was not true.\n\n\nA somewhat common movement among Elorii has been the practice of identifying elemental lords with one of the human gods that supposedly absorbed those elemental lords powers. For instance, some Elorii followers of the Lord of Air consider Hurrian, the Storm Lord in the Pantheon of Man, to be their God. To other Elorii this seems to be heresy and is considered to be so, although the Mother Church (and the Dark Triumvirate in the case of Nier) has little or no issues for Elorii who choose this path.\n\nThe ancient Myrantian Hegemony had its own pantheon of gods, although much information about them has been lost to the ages. The Mother Church of Coryan considers worship of the Myrantian deities heresy, but allows the worship of traditional Pantheon of Man deities under the names of Myrantian gods. The Myrantian Pantheon seems primarily based on the Ancient Egyptian pantheon, though not entirely. \"Tzizhet\" is considered a combination of Sarish and Neroth. \"Shu\" is a god of storms, sky, and magic, considered an amalgam of Hurrian and Sarish.\n\nThe setting also has secret societies, which are factions who have beliefs and goals that occasionally aid or impede the mission of players. Each faction varies in its goals as well as how secret each faction is. Many secret societies exist in the world, though a good number of them are restricted to non-player characters in the living campaigns. The following secret societies have been open to player characters in the living campaigns:\nIn addition, sometimes secret orders are issued to specific nationalities, sides in war, or other subgroups.\n\nLiving Arcanis was the name of the first Living Campaign set in the Arcanis setting. It was run by Paradigm Concepts who hosts major events at large gaming conventions, such as Gen Con and Origins Game Fair. Also, Living Arcanis was played at smaller regional conventions throughout the world, many of which host special events, as well as by players at home.\n\nThe core plot of the campaign was closely controlled by Henry Lopez. There are also several groups of quasi-independent writers whose adventures are sub-plots to the main story and are centered around a specific city, region, or secret society. These domains are known as Invisible Kingdoms, and their stewards are known as Invisible Kings and Queens.\n\nThe first Living Arcanis campaign ended in 2009 with a climactic battle that ended the Coryani Civil War. A second interactive, \"living\" campaign, started a year later with Paradigm's new Arcanis game rules. This new campaign, originally called the Chronicles of the Shattered Empires and renamed Legends of Arcanis, is set about 50 years after the first one.\n\n\n"}

This error rests on misunderstanding the word \"argument\". \"Argument\" can mean \"a series of persuasive statements\" (the legal sense discussed in this article) as well as \"a verbal fight or disagreement\". Thus, an argumentative objection may be raised only when the lawyer himself is making a legal argument under the guise of asking a question. \"Badgering the witness\" is the proper objection for a lawyer who is antagonizing or mocking a witness by asking insulting or derisive questions, perhaps in an attempt to provoke an emotional response.\n\nIn this example, however, the lawyer conducting the direct examination may have an opportunity to rephrase his question. If the judge sustains the argumentative objection, the lawyer may instead ask questions such as \"was John Doe exceeding the posted speed limit?\", \"was John Doe making lane changes without proper signals?\", \"how did Mr. Doe respond to your comments about his driving,\" or \"Did you feel unsafe when you were a passenger in the car driven by John Doe?\"\n\nSuch questions may be permitted and require no legal expertise for a layperson to answer, thus allowing the lawyer to introduce testimony about John Doe's driving habits without specifically using the legal term \"negligence\".\n\n"}

In the 2001 census there were 1,158 households with a total population of 2,765 of whom 1,244 were economically active. The population had increased to 2,942 at the 2011 Census.\n\nThe village is surrounded by hills, including Telegraph Hill at , Marley Heights at , Bexley Hill at , Fridays Hill at and the highest hill in Sussex, Blackdown at , to the northeast. Fernhurst is surrounded by miles of footpaths, the path to the summit of Blackdown commencing at the \"Red Lion\" pub.\n\nThe village, on the Weald, originally developed around crossroads (\"The Cross\") and the village green, and ancient remains (Stone Age and Roman) have been found here. Iron working took place in the 17th/18th centuries; and a turnpike ran through the village. The church, dedicated to St Margaret, () and \"Red Lion\" pub are on the green, where several old houses still remain. With the coming of the railway to Haslemere the village developed around and beyond The Cross, and since the 1960s the village has expanded further westwards. The village houses a commuter population, attracted by the proximity of Haslemere railway station.\n\nIn November 2006 the Fernhurst Society published a book, \"Voices of Fernhurst\", comprising edited extracts of oral history interviews with local villagers.\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Linchmere and had at the 2011 census a total ward population of 5,334.\n\nThe Anglican parish church, dedicated to St Margaret, was rebuilt in the nineteenth century, the south aisle in 1859 and the tower and spire as part of a general restoration by Anthony Salvin in 1881. The interior is plain.\n\nEvery May the traditional \"Revels\" fete is held on the green, raising funds for village societies and some local charities.

In the 1950s, he moved to Buffalo where he became the chief play-by-play announcer for the Buffalo Bills Radio Network, the official radio broadcasting arm of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League from the team's inception as an AFL team in 1960 to 1971, and again from 1977 to 2003. At the time of his retirement in 2003, Miller was the longest-tenured commentator with one team (37 years) in pro football history.\n\nOn July 30, 1960, Van Miller debuted on the air at War Memorial Stadium to call play-by-play for the Bills' inaugural contest against the Boston Patriots. Besides his status as the \"Voice of the Bills,\" Miller was the sports director for WBEN-TV/WIVB-TV for many years. During that time, he served as a sportscaster, weather reporter, and as host of the local version of \"It's Academic\" and \"Beat the Champ\" (a ten-pin bowling show), among other shows. Miller also hosted a popular afternoon program for many years on WBEN radio.\n\nMiller called Buffalo Braves and Niagara University basketball, Buffalo Bisons baseball, Buffalo Stallions soccer, University at Buffalo football and, in his early years, high school sports. Miller continued play-by-play for college basketball well into the 1990s for Empire Sports Network, giving the upstart network credibility in its formative years.\n\nWith the exception of a seven-season hiatus from 1972 through 1978, when the Bills were being carried on rival station WKBW-AM (and Miller was covering the Buffalo Braves), Miller covered the Bills for most of the team's existence. This period included the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965, and the Super Bowl run of the early 1990s. Miller shared the booth with color men Stan Barron, Jefferson Kaye (a trio known as Van, Stan and Fan, which ended with Barron's death and Kaye's departure to Philadelphia to join NFL Films in 1984) and John Murphy. In 2004, Miller retired and Murphy succeeded him as the Bills' play-by-play voice. Of all of his commentary duties, Miller considered the Bills position his favorite; he took personal regret when WKBW picked up Bills rights in 1972, felt serious discomfort having to wish successor Al Meltzer luck, expressed great pleasure when WBEN had reacquired rights to the Bills' broadcasts.\n\nAfter 43 years, Miller called his final broadcast for the Bills as they lost 31-0 to the New England Patriots (the same franchise Buffalo had faced for Miller's first broadcast in 1960) in the last game of the 2003 regular season.\n\nMiller retired with Gloria Miller, whom he had married in 1953, in the town of Tonawanda, New York.\n\nDuring retirement, Miller did guest sports commentary appearances and voiced commercials for some Western New York retail businesses (notably the Grapevine Restaurant, where he was known as \"Van the Grapevine Man\"). The Pro Football Hall of Fame presented him with its Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award in 2004. He is an inductee in the Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame (1998), Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame (1999), and the Chautauqua Sports Hall of Fame (2002).\n\nMiller was an avid tennis player and often paired with Jack Ramsay in doubles matches.\n\nSignature calls include: \"Fandemonium\" – often referring to the celebrations after big Bills wins, and \"Do you believe it?\" after an exciting and often game-changing play. Miller also had a custom-made routine he used when being interviewed on radio shows, in which he called a fictional game in which the host of the show carries the ball just short of the end zone only to fumble on the goal line, after which Miller mocked anguish.\n\nMiller was inducted onto the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame on October 19, 2014. He died July 17, 2015 at the age of 87, from complications due to a stroke. Miller suffered various complications due to old age in his last years. Most of his estate was auctioned off in February 2017, including a large collection of football memorabilia (Miller received, for instance, championship rings as a member of the Bills staff for every AFL and AFC championship in which the team appeared); he also owned a Maserati.\n\n"}

In 2017, its former Principal, James Anderson, was accused by several students and staff of inappropriate behavior and conduct in the workplace. Amidst scandals, Anderson exited the school under mysterious circumstances. In 2018, the school's founder, James Riady, who was earlier indicted by the federal government of the United States for campaign finance violations to the Democratic Party, was charged by the Indonesian government for corruption.\n"}

Hinton's recording career lasted over 60 years, mostly in jazz but also with a variety of other genres as a prolific session musician.\n\nHe was also a photographer of note, praised for documenting American jazz during the 20th Century.\n\nHinton was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, the only child of Hilda Gertrude Robinson, whom he referred to as \"Titter,\" and Milton Dixon Hinton. He was three-months-old when his father left the family. He grew up in a home with his mother, his maternal grandmother (whom he referred to as \"Mama\"), and two of his mother's sisters.\n\nHis childhood in Vicksburg was characterized by extreme poverty and extreme racism. Lynching was a common practice at the time. Hinton said that one of the clearest memories of his childhood was when he accidentally came upon a lynching.\n\nHinton moved with his extended family to Chicago, Illinois, in the fall of 1919, which created opportunities for him. Chicago was where Hinton first encountered economic diversity among African-Americans, about which he later noted, \"That's when I realized that being black didn't always mean you had to be poor.\" It was also where he experienced an abundance of music, either in person or through live performances on the radio. During this time he first heard concerts featuring Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Eddie South, and many others.\n\nMusic was a fixture at home. His mother and other relatives regularly played piano. He received his first instrument – a violin – in 1923 for his thirteenth birthday. While attending Wendell Phillips High School, he played violin in the school orchestra and learned peck horn in order to play in the school's ROTC marching band that was directed by Major N. Clark Smith. He soon transitioned from peck horn to bass saxophone and then to tuba, while also being accepted into the citywide brass band sponsored by \"The Chicago Defender\", where he played with Lionel Hampton.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Hinton attended Crane Junior College for two years, during which time he began receiving regular work as a freelance musician around Chicago. He performed with Freddie Keppard, Zutty Singleton, Jabbo Smith, Erskine Tate, and Art Tatum. His first steady job began in the spring of 1930, playing tuba (and later double bass) in the band of pianist Tiny Parham. His recording debut on November 4, 1930 was on tuba with Parham's band on a tune titled \"Squeeze Me.\" After graduating from Crane Junior College in 1932, attended Northwestern University for one semester, then dropped out to pursue music full-time. He received steady work from 1932 through 1935 in a quartet with violinist Eddie South, with extended residencies in California, Chicago, and Detroit. With this group he first recorded on double bass in the spring of 1933.\n\nIn 1936, Hinton joined the Cab Calloway Orchestra, initially as a temporary replacement for Al Morgan while the band was on tour en route to a six-month residency at the newly opened midtown location of the Cotton Club in New York City. He quickly found acceptance among the band members, and he ended up staying with Calloway for over fifteen years. Until the Cotton Club closed in 1940, the Calloway band would perform there for up to six months per year, going on tour for the remaining six months of the year. During the Cotton Club residencies, Hinton took part in recording sessions with Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Billie Holiday, Ethel Waters, Teddy Wilson, and many others. It was at this time that he recorded what is possibly the first bass feature, \"Pluckin' the Bass\" in August 1939.\n\nHinton appeared regularly on radio while in Calloway's band, either on bass in concerts broadcast from the Cotton Club, or as a cast member for the short-lived music quiz show \"Cab Calloway's Quizzicale.\" These broadcasts brought national attention to the Calloway band and helped enable the successful national tours the band would schedule. They also gave listeners a chance to hear examples of jive talk, which Calloway would formalize through publications such as his \"Hepster's Dictionary\", first published in 1938.\n\nCalloway's band included renowned sidemen such as Danny Barker, Chu Berry, Doc Cheatham, Cozy Cole, Dizzy Gillespie, Illinois Jacquet, Jonah Jones, Ike Quebec, and Ben Webster. Hinton credits Chu Berry with elevating the overall musicianship of the Calloway band in part by encouraging Cab to hire arrangers such as Benny Carter to create new arrangements that would challenge the musicians. As Hinton put it, \"Musically he was the greatest thing that ever happened to the band.\" Hinton was also heavily influenced by the musical innovations of Dizzy Gillespie, with whom he had informal sessions in the late 1930s during breaks between sets at the Cotton Club. Hinton credits Gillespie with introducing him to many of the experimental harmonic practices and chord substitutions that would later be associated with bebop.\n\nIn 1939 when Hinton returned to Chicago for his grandmother's funeral, he met Mona Clayton, who was then singing in his mother's church choir. The two were married a few years later and remained inseparable for the rest of Milt's life. (Mona was his second wife; the first was a brief relationship in the 1930s with Oby Allen, a friend he knew from high school.) He and Mona's only child, Charlotte, was born on February 28, 1947. Mona had begun traveling with the Calloway Orchestra in the early 1940s—the only musician's friend or spouse to do so. She helped musicians in the band manage their money, and she often insisted that they open savings accounts. For band members, she was a trusted confidant who was known for her discretion. When traveling with a toddler became too difficult, the Hintons bought a two-family house in Queens, and ten years later they purchased a larger single-family home in an adjacent neighborhood where they remained for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn addition to caring for their daughter, Mona handled the family's finances, and her attention to detail ensured the couple's financial security later in life. She kept track of Hinton's freelance work, scheduled interviews, coordinated public relations events, and often drove him back and forth to gigs (Hinton never drove as an adult, due in part to a car accident he was involved in as a teenager in Chicago). In the mid 1960s, Mona completed both a bachelor's and a master's degree and taught in the public schools for several years. In the 1970s, she began traveling with Hinton again and was regularly invited to join him at jazz parties and festivals where he performed. At the same time, she was active as a music contractor for Lena Horne and others. Mona was always well respected in the jazz community, and she and Hinton were viewed by many as role models; as the jazz historian Dan Morgenstern noted in an article from 2000, \"If there is a closer couple, I'd be surprised.\"\n\nBy 1950, popular music tastes had changed, and Calloway lacked the funds to support a full big band. Instead, he hired Hinton and a few others to create a smaller ensemble, first a septet and later a quartet, which toured until June 1952, with trips to Cuba and Uruguay. After the Calloway ensemble disbanded, Hinton spent more time as a freelance studio musician in New York City. At first, the work was sporadic, and, as Hinton put it, \"This was the one period in my life when I was worried about earning a living.\" He played as many clubs and restaurants as possible, a practice he would continue for the next several decades. He performed regularly at La Vie en Rose, the Embers, the Metropole, and Basin Street West, where he appeared with Jackie Gleason, Phil Moore, and Joe Bushkin. In the early 1950s, he performed with Count Basie for a brief time in the New York area.\n\nAlthough his freelance work was increasing, in July 1953 Hinton signed a one-year contract to tour with Louis Armstrong. He described the decision as \"very difficult\" as it would force him to be away from his family, and it would also slow down the momentum he was gaining as a freelance musician in New York City. Steady pay and the opportunity to perform with Armstrong were persuasive, and Hinton performed dozens of concerts, including a tour of Japan, as a member of the band. When an opportunity to join the house band for a television show hosted by Robert Q. Lewis in New York opened up in February 1954, Hinton gave his notice to Armstrong and returned to Queens.\n\nFor roughly the next two decades he performed regularly on numerous radio and television programs, including those hosted by Jackie Gleason, Robert Q. Lewis, Galen Drake, Patti Page, Polly Bergen, Teddy Wilson, Mitch Miller, Dick Cavett, and others. As he recalled, \"I had a great situation because I was never on staff. That meant I'd get paid by the show. And since I never spent more than fifteen hours a week on rehearsals and shows, I always had free time to do record dates.\"\n\nBy far, his most regular work during this era was in the recording studio, where Milt was among the first African-Americans to be regularly hired for studio contract work. From the mid-1950s through the early 1970s he contributed to thousands of jazz and popular records as well as hundreds of jingles and film soundtracks. He would regularly play on three three-hour studio sessions per day, requiring him to own multiple basses that he hired assistants to transport from one studio to the next. During this era Milt recorded with everyone from Billie Holiday to Paul McCartney, Frank Sinatra to Leon Redbone, and Sam Cooke to Barbra Streisand. As Hinton summarized his time in the studios, \"I might be on a date for Andre Kostelanetz in the morning, do one with Brook Benton or Johnny Mathis in the afternoon, and then finish up the day with Paul Anka or Bobby Rydell. At one time or another, I probably played for just about every popular artist around in those days.\"\n\nStarting in the mid-1950s, he regularly worked in the studio with Hank Jones (piano), Barry Galbraith (guitar), and Osie Johnson (drums) in a group that informally became known as the New York Rhythm Section. The four played on hundreds of sessions together and even recorded an LP in 1956 that was titled \"The Rhythm Section\".\n\nBy the late 1960s studio work began dropping off, so Hinton incorporated more live performances into his schedule. He regularly accepted club gigs, most often at Michael's Pub, Zinno's, and the Rainbow Room where he performed with Benny Goodman, Johnny Hartman, Dick Hyman, Red Norvo, Teddy Wilson, and others. He also went back on the road, first with Diahann Carroll for a tour in Paris in 1966, and later with Paul Anka, Barbra Streisand, Pearl Bailey, and Bing Crosby. From the 1960s through the 1990s he traveled extensively to Europe, Canada, South America, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East, while also appearing throughout the U.S.\nIn 1968 he began performing as a part of Professionals Unlimited (later renamed the New York Bass Violin Choir), a collective bass ensemble organized by Bill Lee that included Lisle Atkinson, Ron Carter, Richard Davis, Michael Fleming, Percy Heath, and Sam Jones. The group performed irregularly for a number of years and in 1980 released a self-titled album on the Strata-East label (SES-8003) containing material recorded between 1969 and 1975.\n\nHinton taught for nearly twenty years as a visiting professor of jazz studies at Hunter College and Baruch College, first offering a jazz workshop at Hunter in the fall of 1973. During this time he regularly appeared at jazz festivals, parties, and cruises; performing annually at Dick Gibson's jazz parties in Colorado, the Odessa and Midland jazz parties in Texas beginning in 1967, and Don and Sue Miller's jazz parties in Phoenix and Scottsdale.\n\nHe played at the first Newport Jazz Festival in 1954 and was a regular at Newport and other jazz festivals produced by George Wein throughout the next four decades. He was a favorite at the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland, sponsored by Hans Zurbruegg and Marianne Gauer. In 1977 he recorded with Earl Hines and Lionel Hampton. For much of the 1980s and 1990s Hinton was featured on jazz cruises organized by Hank O'Neal, then owner of Chiaroscuro Records.\n\nBy the 1990s, he was revered as an elder statesman in jazz, and he was regularly honored with significant awards and accolades. He received honorary doctorates from William Paterson College, Skidmore College, Hamilton College, DePaul University, Trinity College, the Berklee College of Music, Fairfield University, and Baruch College of the City University of New York. He won the Eubie Award from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Living Treasure Award from the Smithsonian Institution, and he was the first recipient of the Three Keys Award in Bern, Switzerland. In 1993, he was awarded the highly prestigious National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master Fellowship. He also contributed to the NEA's Jazz Oral History Program, continuing a longstanding practice of recording interviews with friends in his basement during extended visits. In 1996 he received a New York State Governor's Arts Award, in March 1998 he was awarded the Artist Achievement Award by the Governor of Mississippi, and in 2000 his name was installed on ASCAP's Wall of Fame.\n\nIn 1990, Hinton's 80th year, WRTI-FM in Philadelphia produced a series of twenty-eight short programs in which he chronicled his life. These were aired nationwide by more than one hundred fifty public radio stations and received a Gabriel Award that year as Best National Short Feature. In the same year George Wein produced a concert as a part of the JVC Jazz Festival in honor of Hinton's 80th birthday. Similar concerts were produced for his 85th and 90th birthdays. By 1996, he ceased performing on bass, due to a number of physical ailments, and he died at the age of 90 on December 19, 2000.\n\nHinton was broadly regarded as a consummate sideman, possessing a sensitivity for appropriately applying his formidable technique and his extensive harmonic knowledge to the performance at hand. He was equally adept at bowing, pizzicato, and \"slapping,\" a technique for which he first became famous while playing with the Cab Calloway Orchestra early in his career. He was also an accomplished sight-reader, a skill which he developed on the road with Calloway and honed during his several decades of studio work. As he described his technical diversity, \"Working with Cab for sixteen years could have made me stale. You play the same music over and over, and after awhile you can do it in your sleep. Many guys liked it that way because it was easy. But when the band business got bad, they weren’t prepared to do anything else. On the other hand, I was able to work on radio and TV and get all kinds of record dates. In a real way, practicing and discipline paid off.\"\n\nHinton received his first camera, a 35mm Argus C3, on his 25th birthday in 1935. He later moved on to a Leica, then a Canon 35mm range-finder, and by the 1960s to a Nikon F. Between 1935 and 1999 Hinton took thousands of photographs, approximately 60,000 of which now comprise the Milton J. Hinton Photographic Collection, co-directed by David G. Berger and Holly Maxson. The Collection includes 35mm black and white negatives and color transparencies, reference and exhibition-quality prints, and photographs given to and collected by Hinton throughout his life. The work depicts an extensive range of jazz artists and popular performers in varied settings - on the road, in recording studios, at parties, and at home - over a period of six decades.\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, Hinton and Berger worked together to organize the photographs and identify the subjects of the photos. In June 1981, Hinton had his first one-person photographic exhibition in Philadelphia, and since then items from the Collection have been featured in dozens of exhibits across the country and in Europe.\n\nPhotographs from the Collection have also regularly appeared in periodicals, calendars, postcards, CD liner notes, films, and books. Hinton and Berger co-wrote \"Bass Line: The Stories and Photographs of Milt Hinton\" (Temple University Press, 1988), and with the addition of Holly Maxson, the three co-wrote \"OverTime: The Jazz Photographs of Milt Hinton\" (Pomegranate Art Books, 1991) and \"Playing the Changes: Milt Hinton’s Life in Stories and Photographs\" (Vanderbilt University Press, 2008). Notable documentary films that have drawn upon the Collection include \"The Long Night of Lady Day\" (Billie Holiday), \"The Brute and the Beautiful\" (Ben Webster), and \"Listen Up\" (Quincy Jones). \"A Great Day in Harlem\", a 1994 documentary about Esquire's photographic shoot of jazz legends in 1958, features numerous photographs by Milt as well as a home movie shot by Mona. In late 2002 Berger and Maxson utilized the Collection along with a number of original interviews with Hinton's friends and colleagues to produce the documentary film \"Keeping Time: The Life, Music & Photographs of Milt Hinton\". It debuted at the London Film Festival, won the Audience Award at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2003, and has been shown at film festivals both domestically and abroad.\n\nIn 1980, in honor of Hinton's 70th birthday, his friends and associates worked to create the Milton J. Hinton Scholarship Fund, which was used to help support the musical studies of a variety of bass students over the next 35 years. In 2014 the fund was transferred to Oberlin College to provide scholarships to students attending the biennial Milton J. Hinton Summer Institute for Studio Bass, established at Oberlin College in 2014 and directed by Peter Dominguez, Professor of Jazz Studies and Double Bass at Oberlin. The institute is one component of a broader relationship between the Hinton Estate and Oberlin, which also includes:\nThis relationship is in line with Hinton's longstanding goal to educate and inspire future generations of musicians. As he noted when discussing one of his own bass teachers, \"For [Dmitri Shmuklovsky], passing on his skill and knowledge to the next generation was a solemn duty. It was a mission that went beyond his music. And looking back, I know his greatest gift was to teach me this strong sense of responsibility. It's the reason I've always tried to help young people. If someone wants to improve, if they have a sincere desire to learn, I've always tried to be there to give them whatever I can.\" The multifaceted relationship between the Hinton Estate and Oberlin College will ensure that Milt and Mona's legacy will be passed on to future generations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2301813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301813", "title": "The Way of Cross and Dragon", "text": "The Way of Cross and Dragon\n\n\"The Way of Cross and Dragon\" is a science fiction short story by American writer George R. R. Martin. It involves a far-future priest of the One True Interstellar Catholic Church of Earth and the Thousand Worlds (with similarities to the Roman Catholic hierarchy) investigating a sect that reveres Judas Iscariot. The story deals with the nature and limitations of religious faith.\n\nThe story originally appeared in the June 1979 issue of \"Omni\". In 1980, it won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story as well as the Locus Award for best short story. It is set in the same fictional \"Thousand Worlds\" universe as several of Martin's other works, including \"Dying of the Light\", \"Sandkings\", \"Nightflyers\", \"A Song for Lya\" and the stories collected in \"Tuf Voyaging\".\n\nDamien Har Veris — a priest skilled in resolving heretical disputes efficiently, although now spiritually exhausted — is sent by his alien archbishop as Knight Inquisitor to deal with a particular sect that has made a saint of Judas Iscariot.\n\nThe sect follows a religious text, \"The Way of Cross and Dragon\", that radically revises the life of Iscariot and his place in Christianity. The text describes how, born of a prostitute, Iscariot mastered the dark arts to become a tamer of dragons and the ruler of a great empire. After torturing and maiming Christ, Iscariot repented and relinquished his empire to become the penitent Legs of Christ, the first and best-beloved of the Twelve Apostles. Returning from proselytizing to find Christ crucified, an enraged Iscariot then destroyed the perpetrating empire and strangled St. Peter for renouncing Christ, only to discover, too late, Christ's Resurrection. Rejecting Judas' violence, Christ restored St. Peter to life and gave him the keys of the kingdom. St. Peter then suppressed the truth about Judas, vilifying his name and exploits. Seeking redemption for his wrath, Iscariot became the thousand-year-old Wandering Jew, before finally rejoining Christ in the Kingdom of God.\n\nPerusing the materials of the sect, Har Veris finds himself enjoying the fanciful, creative but ultimately ridiculous narrative, finding it far more interesting than the more mundane heresies that have developed around power, money and doctrinal quibbles.\n\nArriving on the sect's distant planet onboard his ship, the \"Truth of Christ\", Har Veris confronts its heresiarch, Lukyan Judasson, creator of the \"Way of Cross and Dragon\" narrative, but finds that he is already expected. Questioning Judasson, Har Veris uncovers a conspiracy of nihilistic Liars, who see Truth as entropy and despair, and who wish to soften and color the ultimately meaningless lives of others by creating belief in carefully crafted Lies. In essence, they create faiths. They have perpetrated this Judas cult as well as others, and now want Har Veris to join them. Despite his own spiritual exhaustion, he realizes that, though he may be losing his faith, he has not lost his passion for truth. When he refuses to join the Liars, Judasson wishes to have him silenced, but his senior in the conspiracy, a misshapen psionic mutant, senses the impending Liar in Har Veris, and allows him to go.\n\nHar Veris then uses political manipulation and the public's fear and distrust of psychic powers to turn the tide on the Judas cult, resolving yet another heresy with dispatch. When, much later, he fully acknowledges that he has lost his faith, his superior is indifferent: results are what is needed, and Har Veris is to continue in his role as inquisitor. The priest accepts this, realizing that the psychic was right: he is himself a consummate Liar, perpetuating a faith in which he no longer believes.\n\nHowever, departing on his next Inquisition, he has named his new starship \"Dragon\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2301817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301817", "title": "Kurt Wallander", "text": "Kurt Wallander\n\nKurt Wallander () is a fictional Swedish police Inspector created by Swedish crime writer Henning Mankell (1948 – 2015). He is the protagonist of many mystery novels set in and around the town of Ystad, south-east of the city of Malmö, in the southern province of Scania. Wallander has been portrayed on screen by the actors Rolf Lassgård, Krister Henriksson and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nAs a young police officer, he was nearly killed when a drunk whom he was questioning stabbed him with a butcher's knife (this is mentioned in the account of his first case). Wallander was once married, but his wife Mona left him and he has since had a difficult relationship with his rebellious only child, Linda, who barely survived a suicide attempt when she was fifteen. He also had issues with his late father, an artist who painted the same landscape 7,000 times for a living; the elder Wallander strongly disapproved of his son's decision to join the police force and frequently derided him for it.\n\nWallander is a great fan of the opera; while in his car he regularly listens to recordings of famous opera singers such as Maria Callas, and when he can find the time goes to opera performances, sometimes crossing over to Copenhagen, Denmark for this purpose. At one time, Wallander had dreamed of making opera his life, leaving the police force and becoming the impresario of his friend, Sten Widén, a tenor who aspired to sing opera. But Widén's voice was not good enough and the dream came to naught—a crushing disappointment in Wallander's life (as in Widén's).\n\nInspector Wallander has few close friends and is known for his less-than-desirable lifestyle; he consumes too much alcohol and junk food, exercises very little, and sometimes struggles with anger. He frequently regards the crimes he investigates on a very personal level, throwing himself into catching criminals and going against the orders of his superiors to try to solve a case, often with negative effects on his emotional stability.\n\nOver the years he has grown increasingly disillusioned with his work and often wonders whether he should have become a police officer at all. He was once falsely sued and harassed for police brutality and still lives with the guilt of having shot and killed a man in the fog, an act which drove him into depression and nearly led to his resignation. His relationships with his colleagues are tentative; they are alternately amazed by his intellect and frustrated by his brusque manner and aggressive tactics.\n\nHe is frequently at loose ends socially and with his family. After the breakup of his marriage, he had an affair with Annette Brolin, the prosecutor with whom he was working on some cases — but she was married and had children, and would not consider divorcing for his sake (\"Faceless Killers\"). In later years, he maintains a somewhat inconsistent romantic relationship with Baiba Liepa, a woman in Riga, Latvia, whom he met while investigating a murder there, until it eventually dissolves. Over the course of the series he is diagnosed with diabetes, and towards the end of his career he suffers from memory lapses, discovering he has developed Alzheimer's disease, with which his father was also afflicted.\n\nThe following Kurt Wallander novels have been translated into English. They are listed in the order that they were originally published in Sweden:\n\n\nThe following novel features Wallander's daughter Linda in the lead, while he is a secondary character:\nIt was intended as the first of a spinoff trilogy. However Mankell was so distraught after the suicide of Johanna Sällström, the actress playing the character at the time in the Swedish TV series, that he decided to abandon the series after only the first novel.\n\nThe order that the novels occur in the \"timeline of the series\" is shown below (with the title of the English translation shown in parentheses). Note that there is some overlap in the timeline among the novels as there are three separate series.\n\n\nBetween 1994 and 2007, all nine Wallander novels published at the time were made into films in Sweden starring Rolf Lassgård as Wallander: \n\nFrom 2005 to 2006, 13 new stories, starring Krister Henriksson as Kurt Wallander and Johanna Sällström as Linda Wallander, were produced. The first film, based on \"Before the Frost\", was released in cinemas. The rest are original stories not based on any of Mankell's books, and were released on DVD, with the exception of \"Mastermind\" which was also released in cinemas.\nTwo of these films were directed by BAFTA award winning Swedish director Jonas Grimås, who outside Sweden is best known for his work on British television such as the 1990s crime drama \"Second Sight\" (Kingdom of the Blind) starring Clive Owen, police drama series \"Heartbeat\", and \"Hamish Macbeth\".\n\nYellow Bird announced in March 2008 that 13 new Swedish language Wallander films were to be made with Krister Henriksson. Production started in 2008. These new films were to have a more political slant than the previous films starring Henriksson. The first production in the second series, , was given a cinematic launch in Sweden on 9 January 2009 before being released on DVD. The theme over the closing credits is \"Quiet Night\", sung by Anna Ternheim. The remaining were scheduled to be released on DVD during early 2010: \n\nA third series consisting of six episodes was released in 2013. This is the last season with Krister Henriksson. In these final episodes, Kurt Wallander suffers from memory problems because of Alzheimer’s disease, and he cannot continue to work as a policeman.\n\n\nThe novels have also been adapted as twelve television films for the BBC, produced by Yellow Bird and Left Bank Pictures. The series stars Kenneth Branagh as Wallander. The episodes have not been filmed in the order in which the original novels were published, resulting in changes to the backstories of the lead characters in the films. The first series consisted of the novels \"Sidetracked\", \"Firewall\" and \"One Step Behind\". These three were shot on location in Ystad in the summer of 2008, with a combined budget of £6 million ($12 million). They aired in late 2008 on the BBC.\n\nA second series of Wallander adaptations was commissioned by the BBC from the same production team in 2008. Broadcast in January 2010, the second series was composed of adaptations of \"Faceless Killers\", \"The Man Who Smiled\", and \"The Fifth Woman\".\n\nThe third series began shooting in Ystad and Riga, Latvia in the Summer of 2011 and continued into the winter. Broadcast in July 2012, it consists of adaptations of \"An Event in Autumn\", \"The Dogs of Riga\" and \"Before the Frost\". While the novel \"Before the Frost\" has Wallander's daughter Linda as its protagonist detective, the story was adapted for television so that Wallander himself became the lead.\n\nThe BBC \"Wallander\" series concluded in May 2016 with a three-episode fourth series consisting of an adaptation of \"The White Lioness\" and a two-episode adaptation of Mankell's final Wallander novel, \"The Troubled Man\".\n\nIn November 2018 it was announced that Netflix and Yellow Bird UK were producing a TV series based on the Kurt Wallander character and titled Young Wallander, and a 2019 release date was announced for the six-part series. The series explores the life of Kurt Wallander as a young man, before the events of the books. On September 11, 2019 it was announced that filming had begun on the \"Young Wallander\" series. The series stars Adam Pålsson, Richard Dillane, Leanne Best, Ellise Chappell, and Yasen Atour. The series is directed by Ole Endresen and Jens Jonsson, and written by Ben Harris.\n\nMankell's friend and writer Jan Guillou used Kurt Wallander in the 10th book of his Carl Hamilton-series . Guillou and Mankell also co-wrote the Swedish crime-drama mini series \"Talismanen\" and here we also encounter Kurt Wallander as a supporting character, this time portrayed by actor Lennart Jähkel.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301827", "title": "Trisagion", "text": "Trisagion\n\nThe Trisagion (), sometimes called by its opening line Agios O Theos, is a standard hymn of the Divine Liturgy in most of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.\n\nIn churches which use the Byzantine Rite, the Trisagion is chanted immediately before the \"Prokeimenon\" and the Epistle reading. It is also included in a set of prayers named for it, called the Trisagion Prayers, which forms part of numerous services (the Hours, Vespers, Matins, and as part of the opening prayers for most services).\n\nIt is most prominent in the Latin Church for its use on Good Friday, and is also used in the Liturgy of Hours and in some Catholic devotions.\n\nThe Trisagion prayer is an ancient prayer in Christianity. It may be that the prayer was originally an expansion of the angelic cry recorded in Isaiah ch 6, v 3 (sometimes called the \"Sanctus\") or the one at Revelation 4:8\nIn Greek:\n\nIn Latin:\n\nIn English - Literal Translation:\nIn English - Common Liturgical Translation:\n\nThe Greek phrase \"Trisagion\" translates as \"Thrice Holy\" – as in this hymn God is described as holy in three different qualities; \"Agios o Theos\" means \"Holy God\".\n\nThe hymn is of great antiquity, and perhaps much older than the event assigned by the Greek Menology as connected to its origin. The tradition recounts that during the reign of Theodosius II (408-450) Constantinople was shaken by a violent earthquake, 24 September, and that whilst the people, the emperor and the Patriarch Proclus of Constantinople (434-446) were praying for heavenly assistance, a child was suddenly lifted into midair, to whom all cried out \"Kyrie eleison\" ('Lord, have mercy'). The child was then seen to descend again to the earth, and in a loud voice he exhorted the people to pray : 'Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal'. After giving this exhortation, the child died.\n\nThe hymn was one of the exclamations of the fathers at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and is common not only to all the Greek Oriental liturgies but was used also in the Gallican Liturgy (see Saint Germain of Paris, d. 576), which shows that the hymn is ancient. Some believe it is extremely ancient, perhaps of apostolic-era origin. However this goes against the menology tradition regarding its origin.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church and Armenian Apostolic Church believe that the Trisagion originated from Nicodemus. While taking the body of Christ off the cross with Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus saw Jesus Christ's eyes open and then shouted \"Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal\". Traditionally, it is also considered proof that his Divinity did not part from his humanity.\n\nThe Gallican Liturgy refers to it as being sung both in Greek and in Latin: \"Incipiente præsule ecclesia Ajus\" [that is, Agios] \"psallit, dicens latinum cum græco\", as also previously in Greek alone, before the Prophetia. Benedict XIV thought that the Greek formula was joined with the Latin in allusion to the divine voice heard at Constantinople. But the explanation seems hardly necessary, in view of the retention of Kyrie eleison in the Roman Liturgy, as well as such Hebrew words as Amen, Alleluia, Hosanna, Sabaoth. It is true that the \"Kyrie eleison\" is not joined to a Latin version; on the other hand, it is so simple and occurs so frequently, that its meaning could easily be learned and remembered – whereas the entire Trisagion might well receive a parallel version into Latin.\n\nVarious additions or modifications made to the Trisagion at certain points in history have been the subject of considerable controversy. According to Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor, the phrase 'who wast crucified for us' was added to it by Eustathius of Antioch to combat the Arians, although this is dismissed by some scholars. It was more likely written during the time of Peter the Fuller who enforced its use as a sort of \"test of orthodoxy against Nestorianism\". Those who understood the hymn as being addressed to the Trinity (such as John of Damascus) censured Peter for propagating the teaching of the Theopaschites. Emperor Anastasius I's attempt to adopt the addition in 512 at Constantinople resulted in a riot.\n\nWhether the Trisagion is to be understood as addressed to the Holy Trinity or addressed to God the Son has been a matter of contention, particularly between those who approved of the council of Chalcedon and those who were against it. But, in light of widespread adoption of the hymn with the above addition ('who wast crucified for us'), Calandion, Bishop of Antioch, sought to allay the controversy surrounding it by prefixing the words 'Christ, King'. This had the effect of making the hymn refer directly to the incarnate Word: \"Holy God, Holy and Strong, Holy and Immortal, Christ, King, who was crucified for us, have mercy on us.\" Though perhaps well intended, this effort at emendation was ultimately rejected.\n\nLater Severus, who was the Non-Chalcedonian Patriarch of Antioch, wrote to prove the correct ascription of the hymn to the Son of God, and made the use of the emended version standard in his diocese. \n\nThe eighty-first canon of the Council of Trullo anathematized anyone who allows the Trisagion to be modified by adding \"who was crucified for us\" or any other modification.\n\nIn the eleventh century, Pope Gregory VII (1073–1085) wrote to the Armenians, who still used the emended formula, instructing them to avoid all occasion for scandal by removing the additions, which Pope Gregory argues (incorrectly) that neither the Roman nor any Eastern Church (save the Armenians themselves) had adopted. The injunction appears to have been ignored. When, centuries later, Roman Catholic union with the Armenians was again discussed, a question was addressed (30 January 1635) to the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide as to whether the Armenian Catholics might still use the formula 'who suffered for us'. The request was answered in the negative. Nevertheless, Armenian Catholic continue to use the traditional formula.\n\nVariations of the traditional formula and Trinitarian ascription are found also in the Armenian Orthodox Liturgy. In these the hymn is addressed to the Redeemer, and versions vary with the feast or office. Thus, the formula of Peter the Fuller (above) is used on all Fridays; on all Sundays: 'risen from the dead'; on Holy Thursday: 'betrayed for us'; on Holy Saturday: 'buried for us'; on the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos: 'who came to the death of the Holy Mother and Virgin'; on the feasts of the Holy Cross: 'who was crucified for us'; for the celebration of marriages: 'who took flesh for us', etc.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox and other Oriental Orthodox Churches also use the formula 'crucified for us', with minor seasonal variations from the Armenian use.\n\nWhen the Trisagion is sung during the Divine Liturgy of the Byzantine Rite, before the Prokeimenon of the Gospel that precedes the Epistle reading, it is normally sung three times to one of many melodies composed for it. This is followed by singing \"Glory... Now...\", the second half of the Trisagion once, and finally the whole Trisagion a fourth time:\n\nOn the other hand, in the usage of the other, non-Byzantine Eastern Churches, the Trisagion is simply sung thrice, with no \"Glory... Now...\".\n\nIn the East Syriac Rite, used by the Assyrian Church of the East and Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, the Trisagion is sung towards the beginning of the Holy Qurbana, before the Old Testament Readings.\n\nIn the West Syriac Rite, used by the Syriac Orthodox Church, Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and in a hybrid form, the Maronite Church and other derived rites of Syriac Christianity, the Trisagion is sung towards the beginning of the Holy Qurbana (Divine Liturgy), after the Old Testament Readings and the Introductory Hymn.\n\nIn the Armenian Rite, used by the Armenian Orthodox Church and the Armenian Catholic Church, the Trisagion occurs early in the Divine Liturgy, coming after the troparion of the Monogenes (Only-begotten Son) and the Midday first Antiphon. The choir sings the Trisagion during the lesser entrance of the Gospel Books.\n\nThe Trisagion also has a similar place in the liturgies of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, as well as the Coptic Catholic Church and the Ethiopic Catholic Church.\n\nDuring most services of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Trisagion is combined with several other prayers to form a unit, often called simply the Trisagion Prayers. This set of prayers forms part of the opening prayers of most services, and is also located within many of the Hours and daily cycle of services.\n\nThe full version normally looks like this:\n\nWhile it is possible that the Trisagion has origins in the Biblical 'thrice holy' of Isaiah 6:3 (the Sanctus: Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of your glory', etc.), they are today separate prayers. The latter is used at a different point in the Liturgy (in the Divine Liturgy, during the anaphora).\n\nThe trisagion is also sung at the entry of the coffin into the church at a funeral and when the coffin is carried to the grave. It is also sung at the conclusion of the Great Doxology.\n\nIn the Latin Church, the main regular use of the Trisagion is on Good Friday, when it is sung during the ceremony of the Adoration of the Cross. In the Sistine Chapel, the traditional setting was the polyphonic musical setting of Palestrina. During this service, the hymn is sung by two choirs, alternately in Greek and Latin, originally two antiphonal Greek and Latin choirs, as follows:\n\nThe hymn is sung in this manner thrice, responding to the first three of twelve reproaches.\n\nIn the Latin Church, the Trisagion is employed in the hour of Prime, in the ferial Preces, on ferias of Advent and Lent and on common Vigils. There is a Chaplet to the Holy Trinity used by the Order of the Most Holy Trinity called 'The Trisagion' or the 'Angelic Trisagion', which makes use of both forms of the Trisagion. It also occurs in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin and in the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic church, an indulgence of 100 days was once associated with the Trisagion when prayed once a day together with the Sanctus, with a contrite heart to adore the Holy Trinity.\n\nThe Episcopal Church's 1979 \"Book of Common Prayer\" introduced the Trisagion into the Eucharist in both Rite One and Rite Two as part of the Word of God. In Rite One it follows the Summary of the Law. In Rite Two it can be used as an alternative to the Kyrie eleison, which follows the Collect for Purity and precedes the Collect of the Day. The form of the Trisagion found in the 1979 BCP is as follows:\n\nHoly God,\nHoly and Mighty,\nHoly Immortal One,\nHave mercy upon us.\n\nIn \"Common Worship\" used by the Church of England, the Trisagion is used principally as a concluding prayer of the Litany in the following form:\n\nHoly God, holy and strong, holy and immortal, have mercy upon us.\n\nIt is also used in the Good Friday liturgy in the same way as in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nAmharic (Ethiopia):\n\nGe'ez (Classical Ethiopic):\n\nTigrinya:\n\nHebrew:\nArabic:\n\nChinese:\n\nFilipino:\n\nIndonesian:\n\nJapanese:\n\nKorean:\n\nMalayalam:\n\nMarathi:\n\nEast Syriac:\nܩܰܢܕܺܝܫܰܐ ܐܰܠܳܗܳܐ ܩܰܢܕܺܝܫܰܐ ܚܰܝܠܬܳܢܳܐ ܩܰܢܕܺܝܫܰܐ ܠܐܳ ܡܳܝܽܘܬܳܐ ܐܶܬܪܰܚܰܡ ܥܠܰܝܢ\n\nWest Syriac:\nܩܰܕܺܝܫܰܬ ܐܰܠܳܗܳܐ ܩܰܕܺܝܫܰܬ ܚܰܝܠܬܳܢܳܐ ܩܰܕܺܝܫܰܬ ܠܐܳ ܡܳܝܽܘܬܳܐ ܡܫܺܝܚܳܐ ܪܘܽܡ ܡܶܢ ܒܶܝܬ ܡܺܝܬܶܐ ܐܶܬܪܰܚܰܡ ܥܠܰܝܢ\n\nChavacano:\n\nClassical Armenian:\n\nBelarusian:\n\nBulgarian:\n\nChurch Slavonic:\n\nCroatian:\n\nDanish:\n\nDutch:\n\nEstonian:\n\nFinnish:\n\nFrench:\n\nGeorgian:\n\nGerman:\n\nHungarian:\n\nIcelandic:\n\nItalian:\n\nLow Mari (spoken in the Russian Federation):\n\nNorwegian:\n\nPolish:\n\nPortuguese:\n\nRomanian:\n\nRussian:\n\nSerbian:\n\nSlovak:\n\nSpanish:\n\nSwedish:\n\nTurkish:\n\nUkrainian:\n\nSome services call for replacing the Trisagion with an alternative invocation known as an Anti-Trisagion.

At one time \"Pistacia palaestina\", growing on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea (in Syria and Lebanon) was regarded as a separate species, but it is now considered to be a synonym of \"P. terebinthus\".\n\nIt is a species of flowering plant belonging to the cashew family, Anacardiaceae. A small deciduous tree or large shrub, it grows to tall. The leaves are compound, long, odd pinnate with five to eleven opposite glossy oval leaflets, the leaflets long and broad. The flowers are reddish-purple, appearing with the new leaves in early spring. The fruit consists of small, globular drupes long, red to black when ripe. All parts of the plant have a strong resinous smell.\n\nIt is a dioecious tree, i.e. exists as male and female specimens. For a viable population both sexes must be present. The oblong leaf is bright green, leathery, with long or more with three to nine leaflets. Leaves alternate, leathery and compound paripinnate (no terminal leaflet) with three or six deep green leaflets. They are generally larger and rounder than the leaves of the mastic, reminiscent of the leaves of carob tree. The flowers range from purple to green, the fruit is the size of a pea and turns from red to brown, depending on the degree of maturation. The whole plant emits a strong smell: bitter, resinous, or medicinal. In the vegetative period they develop \"galls\" shaped like a goat's horn (from which the plant gets the name cornicabra, the common name in Spanish), that occur on the leaves and leaflets which have been bitten by insects. The species propagates by seeds and shoots. Although marred by the presence of galls, it is a very strong and resistant tree which survives in degraded areas where other species have been eliminated. Pistacia terebinthus is a plant related to \"Pistacia lentiscus\", with which it hybridizes frequently in contact zones. The cornicabra is more abundant in the mountains and inland and the mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea moderates the climate. The mastic tree does not reach the size of the Pistacia terebinthus, but the hybrids are very difficult to distinguish. The mastic has winged stalks to its leaflets, i.e., they are flattened and side fins, whereas these stems in Cornicabra are simple. On the west coast of the Mediterranean, Canary Islands and Middle East, \"Pistacia terebinthus\" can be confused with \"Pistacia atlantica\".\n\nIt prefers relatively moist areas, up to in elevation. Supports Mediterranean summer drought and frost more intense than mastic. The plant is common in the garrigue and maquis. It appears in deciduous oak wood. It has a gray trunk very aromatic, may have multiple trunks or stems when grown as a shrub. Usually reaching in height, although in rare cases can reach . \"P. terebinthus\" is one of the European species of Anacardiaceae, a family of about 600 mostly tropical species. It can be found to above sea level. \"P. terebinthus\" is more moisture demanding than the mastic and more resistant to cold. It requires a sunny exposure and average soils, tolerating lime and some salt, often grows near the sea, deep ravines and near salt-lakes and streams.\n\nHistorian of Mycenae John Chadwick believes that the terebinth is the plant called \"ki-ta-no\" in some of the Linear B tablets. He cites the work of a Spanish scholar, J.L. Melena, who had found \"an ancient lexicon which showed that \"kritanos\" was another name for the turpentine tree, and that the Mycenaean spelling could represent a variant form of this word.\"\n\nThe Latin name is underlain by the Ancient Greek name τερέβινθος, which, in turn, is underlain by a pre-Greek Pelasgian word, marked by the characteristic consonant complex νθ.\n\nTerebinth from Oricum is referred to in Virgil's Aeneid, Book 10, line 136, where Ascanius in battle is compared to \"\"ivory skilfully inlaid in [...] Orician terebinth\"\" (\"\"inclusum[...] Oricia terebintho [...] ebur\"\").\n\nTerebinth is referred to by Robin Lane Fox in \"Alexander the Great\": \"When a Persian king took the throne, he attended Pasargadae, site of King Cyrus's tomb, and dressed in a rough leather uniform to eat a ritual meal of figs, sour milk and leaves of terebinth.\"\n\nThe terebinth is mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures (or Old Testament), where the Hebrew word (plural ) is used, although the word is sometimes translated as 'oak'. (The Hebrew word means 'oak', and the words may be related.) \n\nThe word \"terebinth\" is found in three successive chapters of Genesis (12:6, 13:18, 14:13, 18:1) in reference to the places where Abram (later Abraham) camped called \"Terebinths of Mam're the Amorite\". Here, the traditional rendering in English is \"oaks of Mamre.\"\n\nIt is also found in Genesis chapter 35, where Jacob commands his family to remove idols that were taken as booty from the battle in Shechem before travelling to Bethel.\n\nTerebinths are also found in Isaiah in possible reference to idolatry associated with the trees, although in the Septuagint and Vulgate the word is translated 'idols', as the plural of .)\nThe best known clear reference to a terebinth () in the Hebrew Scriptures is that of the Valley of Elah or 'Valley of the Terebinth' (), where David fought Goliath (, ).\n\nAt least a few references occur in Judges: chapter 4 (in reference to Heber, the Kenite, of the children of Hobab), chapter 6 (in reference to an angel of the Lord who came to visit Gideon—most versions use 'oak'), and Ch 9 (in reference to the crowning of Abimelech, by the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem—again most versions use 'oak'). This reference of Abimelech's crowning by an oak is actually referring to the Palestine oak, closely related to the Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera). The Hebrew distinguishes the Palestine oak and the terebinth. It is also mentioned in Hosea 4:13 when Hosea is talking about Israel's spiritual adultery by sacrificing to false gods and how to repent and be forgiven in Hosea 14.\n\n\"Pistacia terebinthus\" is used as a source for turpentine, possibly the earliest known source. The word 'turpentine' derives (via French and Latin) from the Greek word τερεβινθίνη \"terebinthine\", the feminine form (to go with the feminine Greek word for resin) of an adjective τερεβίνθινος derived from the Greek noun τερέβινθος, the name for the terebinth tree. The turpentine of the terebinth is now called Chian, Scio, or Cyprian turpentine.\n\nThe fruits are used in Cyprus for baking of a specialty village bread. In Crete, where the plant is called \"tsikoudia\", it is used to flavor the local variety of pomace brandy, also called tsikoudia. In the Northern Sporades the shoots are used as a vegetable (called tsitsíravla). The plant is rich in tannins and resinous substances and was used for its aromatic and medicinal properties in classical Greece. A mild sweet scented gum can be produced from the bark, and galls often found on the plant are used for tanning leather. A triterpene has been extracted from these galls. In Turkey, it is known as \"menengiç\" or \"bıttım\". A coffee-like beverage, Kurdish coffee or \"menengiç kahvesi\", is made from the roasted fruit, and a soap is made from the oil. Terebinth resin was used as a wine preservative in ancient Israel and the ancient Near East.\n\n\n"}

Period gas lamps line the curving streets of the community. The Llewellyn Park Ladies Association is largely responsible for the beautification of the Park. Its activities include annual plantings; purchasing, and selecting appropriate sites for rustic architecture including gazebos and benches; and directing the Park's maintenance staff to care for the trees, shrubs and flowers.\n\nA major function of the Ladies Association is its commitment to fostering a sense of community among Park residents by planning social activities for adults and children. These activities include a Halloween Party for the children and a Holiday Party for adults. Recently the Ladies Association has also sponsored a barn dance, an Easter egg hunt, a Victorian picnic, and a High Tea.

Haskell discovered the lush, wooded area on the eastern slope on the first range of the Watchung Mountains which was originally farmland owned by Ira Harrison Condit. Purchasing 100 acres from Condit in 1855, Haskell set out to create a suburban community of country estates. These finely crafted homes would stand amid majestic trees and running streams.

{"id": "2301845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301845", "title": "Living Newspaper", "text": "Living Newspaper\n\nLiving Newspaper is a term for a theatrical form presenting factual information on current events to a popular audience. Historically, Living Newspapers have also urged social action (both implicitly and explicitly) and reacted against naturalistic and realistic theatrical conventions in favor of the more direct, experimental techniques of agitprop theatre, including the extensive use of multimedia.\n\nThough Living Newspapers originated in Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution, the English term is most often associated with the Living Newspapers produced by the Federal Theatre Project. Part of the federally funded arts program established under the Works Progress Administration in the United States of the 1930s, the Federal Theatre Project wrote and presented a number of Living Newspapers on social issues of the day, including \"Triple-A Plowed Under\", \"Injunction Granted\", \"One-Third of a Nation\", \"Power,\" and \"Spirochete.\" Controversy over the political ideology of the Living Newspapers contributed to the disbanding of the Federal Theatre Project in 1939, and a number of Living Newspapers already written or in development were never performed, including several that addressed race issues.\n\nThe Living Newspaper program began very shortly after the establishment of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP). Following her appointment as National Director of the FTP in July 1935, Hallie Flanagan, a professor and playwright at Vassar College, and playwright Elmer Rice set to work planning the organization and focus of the FTP. The New York Living Newspaper Unit came from this meeting; allied with the American Newspaper Guild, this first and most active of the Living Newspaper Units employed out-of-work journalists and theatre professionals of all types, providing hourly wages for many reporters and entertainers left unemployed by the Depression.\n\nThe research staff of the Living Newspaper Unit quickly compiled their first Living Newspaper, \"Ethiopia,\" which went into rehearsal in 1936. It never opened to the public. The federal government issued a censorship order prohibiting the impersonation of heads of state onstage; the order effectively scuttled the production, which dramatized the invasion of Ethiopia by Italy and featured Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and other real-life figures prominently as characters. Elmer Rice withdrew from the FTP in protest.\n\nLeft with no script and the pressing need to provide its performers with a play, the Unit drew up another Living Newspaper, \"Triple-A Plowed Under,\" within a matter of weeks. Morale had dropped after the cancellation of \"Ethiopia\", and the original director of \"Triple-A Plowed Under\" left in frustration; Joseph Losey, known for his support of the Communist Party and recently returned from a visit to Moscow, replaced him. \"Triple-A Plowed Under\" dramatized the plight of Dust Bowl farmers and suggested that farmers and workers unite to cut out the \"middlemen\" – dealers and other commercial interests. The \"Triple-A\" in the title came from the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, which the play criticized. Like other Living Newspapers to follow, it employed the \"Voice of the Living Newspaper,\" a disembodied voice which commented on and narrated the action; shadows; image projections; elaborate sound design, with sound effects and music; abrupt blackouts and scene changes; and other non-realistic devices to keep the audiences' attention and support the message of the play.\n\nA minor Living Newspaper, \"Events of 1935,\" followed \"Triple-A Plowed Under\". A collage of scenes from many 1935 news events, ranging from celebrity gossip to major legal cases, \"1935\" ran for only 34 performances. Cosgrove identifies it as the \"least successful\" of all the Living Newspapers.\n\nThough \"Triple-A\" had clearly criticized government decisions and supported the laborer over the \"merchant,\" the Unit's third Living Newspaper, also directed by Losey, explicitly supported workers' organizations and angered members of the federal government. \"Injunction Granted,\" which opened four months after the close of \"Triple-A\", lampooned big business men such as H. J. Heinz and newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst and called for unions to join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), a major, militant workers' association. It aroused government concern during rehearsal; and Hallie Flanagan urged Losey to re-write parts of the script, but the play made it to the stage largely unaltered. The piece ran on over-the-top satire and explicit bias: Heinz was introduced holding a giant pickle; Dean Jennings of the Newspaper Guild trounced Hearst in a boxing match; and a clown (played by actor Norman Lloyd) served as master-of-ceremonies for the entire production, according to Cosgrove. \"Injunction Granted\" drew massive criticism and closed early. Losey soon left the Unit and the FTP, though Flanagan offered to give him another chance.\n\nWith the censorship of \"Ethiopia\" and the negative reaction to \"Injunction Granted,\" the Living Newspaper Unit had twice attracted criticism from the government that funded it. In order to continue as a federal program, it became more retrospect and less politically radical in its choice of topics but did not give up its dedication to reportage on major social issues and calls for social change.\n\nIts first production following \"Injunction Granted\" demonstrated this new emphasis. Opening early in 1937, \"Power\" clearly supported the policies of the New Deal and the Works Progress Administration. \"Power\" chronicled the search of the public consumer for affordable electric power and held up the Tennessee Valley Authority project as an example of where such power could come from. The play also introduced the \"little man\" figure to the Living Newspaper – a character who represented the consumer and the public, appearing throughout the play, asking questions and receiving explanations. \"Power\" garnered a positive reception, running for 140 performances and then converting to a scaled-down travelling form for outdoors summer performances throughout the city.\n\nThe next Living Newspaper also met with public and critical success. Over the summer of 1937, Flanagan oversaw the Federal Theatre Project Summer School at Vassar College; the forty theatre artists invited to this program developed the first version of a Living Newspaper on tenant housing which grew to become \"One-Third of a Nation.\" In its finished form, \"One-Third of a Nation\" opened early in 1938 and ran for 237 performances, making it the most successful of the Living Newspapers. The play abandoned some of the experimental nature of the earlier Living Newspapers, using a very realistic set to display the filth and dangers of a tenant slum, but retained the episodic format and multimedia (sound, film, and image) displays that characterized the form. The production received praise from critics and may have helped push through housing legislation. It eventually opened in major cities throughout the country.\n\nDespite its rising success and less radical tone, the tide of government opinion turned against the Federal Theatre Project – and the Living Newspapers in particular – in 1938. Established in this year, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began an investigation of the FTP, focusing on its alleged Communist sympathies and anti-American propagandism. Flanagan defended the FTP and the Living Newspapers, holding that the program had presented propaganda, yes, but \"... propaganda for democracy, propaganda for better housing,\" not propaganda against the government. Despite her defense of the program and President Roosevelt's protests, Congress disbanded the FTP – and with it, the New York Living Newspaper Unit – on July 30, 1939.\n\nThe end of the FTP and the Unit left many complete and partially developed Living Newspaper scripts unperformed and unfinished. Among these were three by African-American playwrights that dealt with race issues and racism, including \"Liberty Deferred\", by Abram Hill and John Silvera, which followed the history of slavery in the U.S. and addressed the lynchings of African-Americans in the South. Some historians suggest that Congress shut down the Federal Theatre Project partially to stifle the voices of African-American theatre professionals and criticism of racism in the U.S., or that the FTP delayed production of these plays out of fear of just such a reprisal.\n\nWhile it is no longer a federally funded initiative, the Living Newspaper project has influenced progressive theatre in the 21st Century. A good example of a theatre company performing in the style of the Living Newspaper is the progressive DC Theatre Collective whose piece, The Tea Party Project, was performed in Washington DC in July 2010.\n\nThough the New York Living Newspaper Unit produced most of the major Living Newspapers, other units in cities throughout the U.S. produced or planned Living Newspapers. In most cases, these productions were local runs of the New York Living Newspapers. Both \"Power\" and \"One-Third of a Nation\" ran throughout the U.S., with the scripts altered to various degrees to suit local conditions. In Seattle, the mayor declared \"Power Week\" in honor of the week-long run of \"Power,\" recognizing the timeliness of the play's subject matter: With the public Bonneville hydroelectric project on the horizon, private and public power companies were vying for support in the city.\n\nNon-New-York Units also researched and wrote their own Living Newspapers. The Southwest Unit, in California, planned and researched \"Spanish Grant,\" on a historical incident in which a series of \"speculative land deals\" took land from communities, and \"Land Grant\", on the 1848 cession of California to the United States and corrupt land deals that led up to it. Washington's unit planned \"Timber\"; Iowa's \"Dirt\"; and Connecticut's \"Stars and Bars\"; however, none of these regional Living Newspapers ever made it to full production.\n\nOn the other hand, Chicago produced an original Living Newspaper that rivalled the later New York Living Newspapers in its impact and positive reception. In 1938, Arnold Sundgaard's \"Spirochete,\" a Living Newspaper on the history of syphilis, opened in Chicago. Using the image projections, extensive sound design, shadowplay, brief scenes, and \"little man\" character (here, a patient embodying all syphilis sufferers throughout history) made standard by the New York Unit, \"Spirochete\" followed syphilis from its introduction in Europe in the 15th century through to the social stigma surrounding it in the 1930s. The play pushed for audiences to support the Marriage Test Law of 1937, which required blood tests for syphilis prior to marriage. \"Spirochete\" became the second most produced Living Newspaper, after \"One-Third of a Nation\" and ran in four other major cities as part of a nationwide syphilis-education and -prevention campaign.\n\nThough definitions of the Living Newspaper and its purpose, both within the Federal Theatre Project and at large, varied, certain characteristics united all of the FTP's Living Newspaper productions.\n\nFirst, a Living Newspaper's content always centered on some current event or issue affecting the United States working class at large – whether it be the spread of syphilis, slum housing conditions, or the search for affordable electrical power. Teams of research workers, many of whom were out-of-work journalists, carried out extensive research to provide the factual base for each Living Newspaper. Editors then organized the information and turned it over to writers, who collectively assembled a Living Newspaper from this collage of facts, statistics, newspaper clippings, and anecdotes. Though Hallie Flanagan repeatedly stated that Living Newspapers should be objective and unbiased, most Living Newspaper productions communicated a clear bias and a call for action from the watching audience.\n\nSecond, the FTP's Living Newspapers tended to break from realistic stage conventions in favor of non-naturalistic, experimental dramaturgy and stage design. \"Techniques Available to the Living Newspaper Dramatist,\" a guide compiled by the Federal Theatre Project in 1938, lists many of the elements that became characteristic of the Living Newspaper. These included quick scene and set changes; flexibility of stage space, using many levels, rolling and hand-carried scenery, and scrims to establish a multitude of locations without elaborate constructed sets; projection of settings, statistics, and film; shadowplay; sound effects and full musical scores; the use of a loudspeaker to narrate and comment on the action; and abrupt blackouts and harsh spotlights. The guide also suggests the use of puppetry, modern dance, and pantomime. In terms of dramatic construction, the guide urges writers and designers to keep the concept of counterpoint in mind when constructing Living Newspapers—alternating quickly between scenes and voices displaying contrasting viewpoints, to comment on the action and keep the audience involved and aware.\n\nThe developers of the Living Newspapers built upon theatrical forms they had encountered in Bolshevik Russia, Germany, and European workers' theatre. Living-Newspaper-like performances appeared in Bolshevik Russia as early as 1919, using a variety of devices (such as lantern slides, songs, newspaper readings, and film segments) to present news and propaganda to the illiterate. As the form matured in Russia, workers' groups put on highly regionalized Living Newspapers, treating issues of public interest and concern. \"Zhivaya Gazeta\" (the Russian term for \"Living Newspaper\") reached its peak from 1923 to 1928; Hallie Flanagan visited the country and witnessed workers' performances during this period, in 1926. The Blue Blouse theatre groups, which employed satire and demanding acrobatics to bring news to the public, particularly captured Flanagan's attention. The work of Russian theatre artists Vsevolod Meyerhold and Vladimir Mayakovsky, active during this time, also influenced the form, as did the work of German theatre artists Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On 4 September 2017, the IOC announced a partnership with beIN Sports to launch a local linear version of Olympic Channel for MENA on 1 November 2017.\n\nAl Jazeera Sport was founded on 1 November 2003 by Qatari channel Al Jazeera.\n\nOn 1 November 2005, the channel launched its new website.\n\nThe network of Al Jazeera Sport channels is separated from the Al Jazeera group and renamed BeIn Sports on 1 January 2014.\n\nThere are 11 Arabic-language sports channels in the beIN Sports group:\nIn 2016, BeIN Sports founded 4 events channels.\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing diplomatic crisis between Qatar and other Arab nations, the beIN Sports channels were briefly banned in the United Arab Emirates in June 2017, and Saudi Arabia banned beIN from selling its subscriptions in the country. The channels have since become available in Saudi Arabia via an unofficial satellite service known as beoutQ, which repackages beIN Sports channels as their own by overlaying its own digital on-screen graphics on the feed. beIN has published evidence linking the service Arabsat, but its operators have consistently denied any involvement. The beoutQ service has been criticised by a number of sports sanctioning bodies and event organisers due to its commercial-scale copyright infringement.\n\nOn 2 October 2018, Qatar filed a case against Saudi Arabia with the World Trade Organization, citing violations of the TRIPS Agreement. The same day, beIN Media Group also initiated an investment arbitration lawsuit against Saudi Arabia seeking US$1 billion in damages, citing beoutQ and other measures decided to hinder its business in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn February 2019, beIN's managing director stated that rightsholder stances on beoutQ's \"industrial-scale theft\" would be a consideration in future rights deals, and that it would also pay less because it can no longer guarantee that its rights would be protected. He went on to explain that \"we have been warning of the very real commercial consequences of beoutQ's theft of world sport and entertainment for almost two years now – yet the piracy continues with impunity every day and represents an existential threat to the economic model of the sports and entertainment industry.\" In June 2019, beIN laid off 300 employees, citing the piracy issues as a factor. It also declined to renew its rights to Formula One, which were instead acquired by free-to-air satellite channel MBC Action.\n\nFree-to-air broadcasters in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia decided against sub-licensing domestic rights to the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations from beIN, considering the fees they were charging to be too exorbitant.\n\nOn 22 June 2018, minister Saud al-Qahtani stated that the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) had filed a complaint with FIFA against beIN Sports' monopolization of sports broadcast rights in the MENA region.\n\nOn 21 August 2018, beIN Sports was fined US$2.6 million by Saudi Arabia for violations of competition law, including forced bundling of its services with other unrelated channels. beIN responded to the fine by claiming it was politically-motivated, arguing that they were being \"attacked by the Saudi authorities for doing exactly what sports and entertainment broadcasters around the world do, and indeed what other broadcasters active in the Saudi market also do\", and that the actions were \"another illegitimate attempt by Saudi Arabia to drive beIN's highly successful business from the country, putting politics ahead of the interests of Saudi consumers.\", also factoring in the aforementioned beoutQ piracy operation. On 23 August 2018, beIN Sports' license to broadcast in Saudi Arabia was officially revoked.\n\nOn 12 March 2019, the SAFF announced that the Asian Football Confederation had stripped beIN Sports of its media rights in Saudi Arabia to \"cancel\" its monopoly on football, citing the \"illegality of BeIN Sport to transmit in the Kingdom due to the grave violations of the laws and regulations BeIN Sport has committed\", and \"its inability to obtain the required licenses necessary for it to fulfil its commitments in transmitting AFC's competitions to the viewers and followers in the Kingdom\". The AFC announced that it would \"gradually\" transition its media rights to an in-house digital platform, beginning with a Saudi Professional League match occurring that week. The AFC had previously condemned the aforementioned beoutQ for its illegal broadcasts of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. beIN subsequently announced that it would pursue legal action, accusing the AFC of apparent collusion with the SAFF to breach its media rights agreements.\n\nThe only European satellite broadcasting JSC Sports is Hot Bird. According to Al Jazeera's former general manager, Aiman Jada, this decision was imposed because the channel is being picked up in the south of Europe, which is causing rights problems.\n\nOn 1 March 2014, they launched SD switch-off on satellite. These channels will carry a text caption with SD shutdown information until 11 June 2014.\n\nOn 11 June 2014, BeIN Sports switch-off SD satellite transmissions.\n\nOn its launch in 2003, Subscribers could receive encrypted programs with an integrated CA on satellite receivers.\n\nSince 1 March 2014, after switching to the Irdeto secure mode, subscribers must have a JSC/BeIN receiver to watch encrypted programs.\n\n\n"}

It was written in 1949 in support of the progressive movement, and was first recorded by The Weavers, a folk music quartet composed of Seeger, Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman. It was a number 10 hit for Peter, Paul and Mary in 1962 and then went to number three a year later when recorded by Trini Lopez.\n\nThe Weavers released the song under the title \"The Hammer Song\" as a 78 single in March 1950 on Hootenanny Records, 101-A, backed with \"Banks of Marble\".\n\nThe song was first performed publicly by Pete Seeger and Lee Hays on June 3, 1949, at St. Nicholas Arena in New York City at a testimonial dinner for the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States, who were then on trial in federal court, charged with violating the Smith Act by advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government.

The ensemble was built in the early eighteenth century by the famous Baroque architect, Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt, and comprises the Upper and Lower Belvedere, with the Orangery and Palace Stables, as well as extensive gardens. As one of Europe's most stunning Baroque landmarks, it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nToday, the Belvedere houses the greatest collection of Austrian art dating from the Middle Ages to the present day, complemented by the works of international artists. At the Upper Belvedere, visitors not only encounter artworks drawn from over five hundred years of art history but can also experience the magnificent staterooms. In addition to the Lower and Upper Belvedere, the museum has further sites at Prince Eugene's town palace and the 21er Haus as well as the Gustinus Ambrosi Museum.\n\nThe Belvedere's art collection presents an almost complete overview of the development of art in Austria and, thus, an insight into the country's history. The world's largest collection of Gustav Klimt's paintings lies at the heart of the presentation of \"Art around 1900\", on show at the Upper Belvedere. Its highlights are Klimt's paintings, \"The Kiss\" (1908/09) and \"Judith and the Head of Holofernes\" (1901), and masterpieces by Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. Key works of French Impressionism and the greatest collection of Viennese Biedermeier art are further attractions at the museum.\n\nThe two Belvedere palaces housed an array of artworks even when they were the summer residence of the art patron and collector, Prince Eugene. After the Prince’s death, the Habsburgs acquired some of his collections together with the palaces. Various parts of the imperial art collection were subsequently placed on display at the Belvedere from 1781 onwards. In 1903, the state's \"Moderne Galerie\" was opened at the Lower Belvedere. After the fall of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the Upper Belvedere and the Orangery were converted into museums as well. The Österreichische Galerie (Austrian Gallery), as the museum was named in 1921, came to comprise the Baroque Museum in the Lower Belvedere (opened in 1923), the Gallery of 19th Century Art at the Upper Belvedere (from 1924), and the Modern Gallery at the Orangery (from 1929). The Belvedere's collection of medieval art was first exhibited at the Orangery next to the Lower Belvedere in 1953.\n\nIn 1955, after years of rebuilding and renovation, the Upper Belvedere was reopened to the public, showing works by Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka, and other major Austrian artists.\n\nIn the years after the Second World War, there were many acquisitions and the museum was expanded and modernized. The Österreichische Galerie Belvedere is today one of the Austrian Federal Museums (Bundesmuseen) and since 2000 has been a vollrechtsfähige \"wissenschaftliche Anstalt\" (a legally independent public research/scientific institution).\nAgnes Husslein, formerly director of the Salzburg Rupertinum and the Museum der Moderne on the Mönchsberg, was director of the Belvedere between 2007 and 2016. She has positioned the Belvedere as a museum of Austrian art in an international context.\n\nFollowing extensive adaptation and remodelling, the highlights of the collections of medieval and Baroque art (previously in the Lower Belvedere) have been placed on display at the Upper Belvedere since spring 2008. For the first time, the entire scope of the permanent collection, from the Middle Ages to the mid-twentieth century, can now be seen under one roof. The adapted rooms in the Lower Belvedere and Orangery now provide space for temporary exhibitions. Moreover, a study collection of the medieval holdings was set up in the former Palace Stables. The permanent collections were redisplayed in 2011.\n\nVisitor numbers have been increasing steadily during the years of Husslein's directorship and, in 2012, they surpassed the one million mark for the first time (1,088,000 visitors).\n\n\n"}

In the first episode, Nate is returning to Los Angeles on Christmas Eve only to learn that his father has died.\n\nA recurring theme throughout the series is Nate searching for the ideal life. In the pilot episode, he meets Brenda Chenowith on an airplane and has sex with her upon landing. Brenda becomes his on-again/off-again lover throughout the series. Upon learning of his father's death, his mother asks him to stay, despite Nate wanting to return to Seattle. Displeased with the direction his life is going, Nate agrees to stay and become business partners with his brother in the funeral home. Nate becomes diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and becomes engaged to Brenda around the same time. During their engagement, Brenda sleeps with others, claiming a sex addiction which Nate does not believe. Nate began having seizures and seeks treatment for his AVM. Nate marries his former girlfriend Lisa, after discovering that Lisa is pregnant (between seasons 2 and 3). When their daughter Maya is still very young, Lisa disappears and is eventually discovered to have drowned. It's later implied that she was murdered by her brother-in-law when she tried to end their affair. Nate conspired to fulfill Lisa's wishes for a \"green\" burial. Nate reconciles with Brenda and they move in together. He agrees to marry her and have a child but Brenda miscarries on the eve of their wedding. Nate doesn't want Brenda's next pregnancy.

Natelike his fathercontinues to appear in these episodes as a mental manifestation of his surviving family.\n\nDavid James Fisher (1969–2044), played by Michael C. Hall, is the middle child in the Fisher family. Prior to the start of the series, David was engaged to a woman named Jennifer Mason, but broke the engagement because he was unsure of his sexuality. David is gay but no one knows except his boyfriend, Keith Charles, a police officer, whom he met at a church social function. Keith has come out to his family and friends and quickly loses patience with David hiding his own sexuality. David joined the family business in 1989 at the age of 20 and was upset that his brother Nate did not do the same. After his father's death and Nate's return, David holds resentment towards Nate, which is resolved when Nate agrees to help with the family funeral business. At the same time, David is offered his father's old position as deacon at their local church, which frowns upon homosexuality. After breaking up with Keith over continuing sexuality issues, David briefly engages in some anonymous sex, for which he suffered ongoing legal issues. After arranging a funeral for a young gay man who was brutally murdered for his sexual orientation, David comes out to his family and resigns his post as deacon. David and Keith eventually reconcile and start planning a family together. Soon after, David is carjacked. The experience leaves him extremely traumatized and he remains so for the rest of the series. They later adopt two young boys (brothers) Anthony and Durrell.\n\nDavid marries Keith around 2009 and they remain together until Keith's death in 2029.

Ruth had an unhappy and abusive childhood, so she has learned to bottle her emotions, frequently resulting in a violent outburst.\n\nRuth married Nathaniel Fisher in 1965 after becoming pregnant with her first child, Nate, who was born while Nathaniel is serving in Vietnam. Four years later, David was born. Their last child, Claire, is born much later, in 1983. Feeling trapped in a maternal role at such a young age, Ruth resented her younger sister Sarah, an artist whom Ruth views as a free spirit.\n\nBefore the series begins, Ruth had an affair with her hairdresser, Hiram Gunderson. After Nathaniel's sudden death, she calls off the affair to mourn but rekindles the relationship some months later. Ruth takes a job at a flower shop, where the owner Nikolai becomes infatuated with her. Hiram then breaks up with Ruth and she begins seeing Nikolai. Ruth ends their relationship when she realizes Nikolai has been feeling suffocated by her attentions and has only been staying with her out of guilt.\n\nDuring her daughter-in-law Lisa's disappearance, Ruth struggles with her emotions and her role of matriarch. During this time, she meets and marries geologist George Sibley after six weeks of courtship. Ruth discovers unpleasant facts about her new husband's past, including multiple wives and an estranged son. Over time, George becomes increasingly paranoid, particularly with beliefs regarding an inevitable nuclear apocalypse, forcing Ruth to admit him for treatments including electro-convulsive therapy. Finding it hard to deal with his subsequent memory loss and emotional instability, Ruth decides to set George up with a life separate from hers before eventually divorcing him.\n\nAfter Nate's death, Ruth decides she needs a change in her life and moves in with her sister Sarah and her caretaker, Bettina. Ruth dies at the age of 79 at a hospital with George and her surviving children at her bedside.

Claire dated a fellow college student Russell, who struggled with his sexuality and had an affair with their professor, Olivier.\n\nDuring Season 5, Claire works as a temp in a legal department where she meets and begins to date Ted, a handsome Republican lawyer, despite having left-wing views. Ted becomes a source of comfort after Nate's death. In the series finale, Claire receives a job offer to work as a photographer's assistant in New York, but the job offer is later rescinded. Claire's mental manifestation of Nate encourages her to move to New York anyway, assuring her she will find something. Claire decides to do so, leaving her family and Ted behind, driving to NYC in her new Toyota Prius, replacing the family's vintage Cadillac hearse, which she wrecked. On her journey, she listens to a CD which Ted gave her, a compilation of 'un-hip' songs he listens to. In 2025, then in her 40s, Claire returns to L.A. shortly before her mother's death. She reunites with Ted at her mother's funeral and later marries him. According to her obituary, she became an award-winning photographer and taught photography as a faculty member at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 2018, earning tenure in 2028. Claire eventually dies of natural causes in 2085 at the age of 102, as she lies in her bed surrounded by pictures of her family – eight decades after the finale and the last to die from those introduced in the opening episode.\n\nBrenda Chenowith (1969–2051), played by Rachel Griffiths, is Nate's girlfriend and, later, wife. Her parents are wealthy psychiatrists who were in an open marriage, flaunting their activities in front of their children. As a child, she was under the scrutiny of Dr. Gareth Feinberg and various psychologists who began documenting her odd behavior. Being a genius, however, she would study the symptoms of various mental disorders and feign them to spite the doctors. Her case was turned into a best-selling book titled \"Charlotte Light and Dark\", which haunts Brenda into adulthood.\n\nHer brother (Billy) is a successful photographer, struggling with bipolar disorder. Brenda spent much of her life taking care of Billy and has struggled to build her own life outside of Billy's illness. Billy has a strong fixation on Brenda's life and their relationship at times bordered on incest.\n\nAt the time of the series beginning, Brenda runs a shiatsu massage service out of her house. Brenda meets Nate Fisher on a flight from Seattle to Los Angeles, immediately before Nate learns of his father's death. The two begin a relationship which is often interrupted by her brother Billy who continues to find his way into her life. After she has her brother institutionalized for violent behavior, Brenda returns to college to study psychology and begins writing a novel to stave off depression. She develops a friendship with a high-class prostitute and eventually finds herself succumbing to sexual impulses outside of her relationship. Nate breaks up with Brenda after her sexual addiction is revealed. Consequently, she spirals into drug addiction and harmful behavior. Brenda moves away from Los Angeles and seeks therapy.\n\nBrenda returns to L.A. after her father is diagnosed with terminal cancer. She then begins a relationship with her neighbor Joe, who likes to be dominated in bed. After Joe catches Brenda making out with Nate, he ends the relationship and moves out of the house they had recently bought.\n\nBrenda reconciles with Nate and becomes pregnant.

Brenda later marries a man named Daniel Nathanson and has another child, Forrest Nathanson. She dies of natural causes in 2051, aged 82, while sitting talking with her brother Billy.\n\nKeith Dwayne Charles (1968–2029), played by Mathew St. Patrick, is David's main love interest over the course of the series. Keith was born in 1968 in San Diego and attended West Point Military Academy, before graduating with a degree in Criminology in 1989. David and Keith began dating some months before the pilot episode after meeting at a gay-friendly church.\n\nKeith is an openly gay policeman who works for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). He tolerates David hiding his sexuality until an incident where a fellow shopper calls them \"fags\". Keith dumps David and begins dating an emergency medical technician named Eddie, but their relationship fails when Keith becomes concerned with his niece Taylor and his sister Karla Denise, who goes into drug rehabilitation. David and Keith then reconcile. After Keith's sister is incarcerated, Keith gets custody of Taylor and begins adoption proceedings. However, after Keith brutally beats a man during a domestic violence call, he resigns from the LAPD and gives Taylor to his parents without consulting David. David is hurt and furious, and the two go into couples' counseling to sort out their issues.\n\nAfter another breakup with David, Keith finds work as a bodyguard, but does not reveal his sexuality to co-workers. He is selected to go on tour with pop star Celeste (Michelle Trachtenberg). While Keith is on tour, David is carjacked and tortured, so Keith returns home for several days, but returns to the tour at David's insistence. While he is gone, David begins to suffer from panic attacks and becomes emotionally unstable. Keith, who has \"come out\" at work, confides in Celeste about David, and she seduces him into having sex, then fires him the next day for the indiscretion. When Keith gets home, he confesses the one-night stand to David, and David suffers anxiety that Keith will leave him for a woman. Keith is hired as personal security to an agent named Roger in order to have a lawsuit against David (who had previously attacked Roger and was being sued) dropped.\n\nTowards the end of Season 4, Keith and David decide to have children, with Keith favoring surrogacy and David favoring adoption. During Season 5, after the surrogacy attempt fails, they adopt brothers Anthony and Durrell, whom David met at a fair. Durrell is rebellious due to his history of foster care, but despite Keith's protests, David insists that they keep the boys. Soon, Keith begins to embrace his new family life. Keith offers to combine his savings with David's when Rico has a chance to buy his own smaller mortuary and agrees to sell back his 25% share of Fisher & Diaz Funeral Home for $500,000.\n\nThe series finale and official HBO website reveal that Keith eventually owns his own security company, and dies in 2029 after being gunned down in an armored car. While at a family function in 2044, David sees Keith in a vision, still young and healthy and playing football; Keith smiles at David who immediately dies from a heart attack.\n\nHector Federico \"Rico\" Diaz (1974–2049), played by Freddy Rodriguez, is the extremely skilled restorative artist who later becomes a partner in the business. In 1992, Rico's father Mauricio slipped on the roof and landed face-first in a pile of bricks next to the house. Rico and his mother Lilia went to the Fisher funeral home for burial, and to Rico's shock, Nathaniel Fisher Sr. (who then owned and operated the home) had made his father look just as he was before the accident. Rico struck up a friendship with Nathaniel, who paid for his education and hired him as a restorative artist. They remained close until Nathaniel's death. Rico married his high school sweetheart, Vanessa and had two children. Federico graduated from Cypress College in 1997 with a degree in Mortuary Science. Rico is considered one of the best in the business, and is briefly lured away by a funeral home chain called Kroehner Services International, before he realizes he has become just another over-worked employee. He returns to work with David and Nate, though often resenting his status within the business. Although Rico and Vanessa struggle for money, they receive inheritance from an elderly neighbor and Rico buys 25% of Fisher & Sons, becoming Fisher & Diaz Funeral Home. Rico becomes involved with a stripper and is thrown out by his wife. He is devastated by the breakdown of his marriage, however he and Vanessa eventually reconcile. Federico is frequently in conflict with the Fishers over the direction of the business. After the death of Nate, Federico is pondering his future with Fisher & Diaz when he hears about a mortuary in the area for sale. David and Keith purchase Rico's 25% and Federico and Vanessa go on to establish the Diaz Family Mortuary in 2005, where he serves the community for 35 years before retiring. Rico dies in 2049 at age 75 on a cruise ship apparently of a heart attack while at his wife's side. He leaves behind his wife Vanessa, his sons Julio and Augusto and his three grandchildren: Emily, Celestina and Vincent.\n\nBilly Chenowith, played by Jeremy Sisto, is an artist and Brenda's younger brother. He suffers from bipolar disorder and occasionally suffers from disruptive, and sometimes violent, episodes of mania, depression, and psychosis. While his disorder can be managed with medication, he sometimes stops using it for various reasons, which has caused many issues for his family, especially Brenda. In 1986, he burnt down a section of the family home which caused Brenda to leave school and abandon her fiancé. In another incident, he carved a tattoo off his back with a box cutter and attempts to do the same to his sister, forcing his sister to have him committed. Billy is an alumnus and associate professor at LAC-Arts, where Claire Fisher also attends college until late 2004. Billy first meets Claire in 2001 at Brenda's place but nothing happens besides casual flirting. After being institutionalized, the only person he can talk to is Claire and they begin to communicate over instant messaging. After he is released he rekindles the relationship, and the two begin dating two years later, briefly living together. After some taunting by old acquaintances that he's not the guy he used to be, coupled with finding himself lacking artistic inspiration, Billy again ceases to take his medication. When Claire realizes this, she breaks it off with him for her own safety. Billy goes back on his medication and asks Claire to take him back, but she refuses. Billy later helps his sister after Nate dies, until she asks him to leave. However, the two remain close and Billy is present when Brenda dies. During Brenda's death, Billy is shown talking about Claire's husband, Ted.\n\nGeorge Sibley, played by James Cromwell, is Ruth's second husband, a professor of geology who had been married six times previously. He has two children from a previous marriage: a son, Brian, and a daughter, Maggie, who is a traveling pharmaceutical representative. While he was still a student, George dated a woman and she became pregnant with a son, Kyle. Before Kyle was born, however, George signed away his custodial rights, and Kyle, though he was born into great wealth, intensely hated his father and sent boxes of feces to the Fisher home. George and Kyle later reconcile with Ruth's help. George suffers from psychotic depression and undergoes electroconvulsive therapy, still recovering from the wounds of his mother's suicide when he was a child in 1953. It soon becomes too much for Ruth to take care of him, and the two separate. After adjusting, he reveals to Ruth that he is engaged for the eighth time. Ruth warns this new fiancée of George's past and sabotages the relationship. George and Ruth later reconcile at the time of Nate's death.

Ruth and George remain in separate residences, but stay together until her death in 2025.\n\nVanessa Diaz, played by Justina Machado, is Federico's high school sweetheart, wife and mother of his two sons Julio and Augusto.

She later finds work at a hospital. In 2003 Vanessa sinks into clinical depression following the death of her mother and begins abusing prescription medication. When her health begins to suffer she seeks help; her increased spending habits and closeness to her sister Angelica alienate Rico. In late season four, Federico's infidelity causes the couple to separate and consider divorce. After finding it difficult to live and raise her sons alone, she asks Federico to move back in. However, she is initially very cold towards him, refusing to communicate with him more than the bare minimum and taking every opportunity to let him know he is not forgiven for his actions. When Rico finally tells her that he does not want to be there if she no longer loves him and will move out for good, Vanessa begins treating him a little better, and they slowly begin to successfully work through their issues until their marriage is back on solid footing.

Although Ruth viewed him as a distant husband and father, many flashbacks show him trying his best to bond with his children, but also to give them their space, as well as acting as a surrogate father and friend to Rico. Even after his death, he is still a presence with all of the Fishers and Rico and frequently appears in scenes as the living characters converse with him, visually like a \"ghost\" but actually as a fiction of their minds and sort of a conscience. In many of the early episodes, family members have lengthy conversations with the senior Nathaniel, on their way to reconciling themselves with his death. His children, particularly Nate, all come to realize that they never really knew their father; something they all grieve. Both Nathaniel Sr. and Jr. appear to Ruth shortly before her death.\n\nLisa Kimmel Fisher (1967–2003), played by Lili Taylor, is Nate's friend from Seattle who becomes pregnant by him after a one-night stand.

It becomes evident that she is dead and her corpse is later found washed up on the beach. Nate conflicts with Lisa's family about how she wanted to be buried; Lisa had told him that she wanted to be buried in the wilderness with no chemicals or preservatives, while her family wants her cremated and buried in their family mausoleum in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Nate buries Lisa as she wanted, while giving her family the cremated remains of an unclaimed body from several decades earlier. At the end of season 4, it is revealed that her brother-in-law, Hoyt, with whom she had an affair before marrying Nate, was with her on the beach the day she drowned. The details of Lisa's death are left ambiguous (although murder by Hoyt is strongly implied, it is never confirmed) but she remains in the show as another deceased character who appears in recurring visions, frequently to Nate or Brenda.\n\nMargaret Chenowith, played by Joanna Cassidy, is Brenda and Billy's dysfunctional mother and a psychologist. Her bouts of misplaced anger can be seen throughout the series. In the 1960s, she met her future husband, Bernard Chenowith in therapy when she was working as an intern. The couple married in 1967. In the 1970s, the Chenowiths had become controversial for allowing their daughter Brenda to undergo testing by the controversial Gareth Feinberg, who later wrote \"Charlotte: Light and Dark\" about Brenda. Though Margaret and Bernard have an open marriage, they separate briefly in 2002 after Bernard lies about an infidelity.

Nate's feelings for her, combined with his problems with Brenda, lead to him committing adultery with Maggie on the evening of his seizure. Maggie suffers guilt and tried to make amends with Brenda, who is not interested. Maggie leaves town after Nate's funeral and an argument with her father. Ruth later calls Maggie to ask her if Nate had been happy while he was with her before he had his stroke. During the phone call, Maggie is at the doctor's office, which led to audience speculation as to whether she was pregnant with Nate's child. Alan Ball specifically denied this speculation during his DVD commentary on the series finale, noting that as a pharmaceutical industry representative, Maggie is simply working when we see her in the doctor's office.\n\nSarah O'Connor, played by Patricia Clarkson, is Ruth's artistic younger sister who runs an artists' colony in Topanga Canyon. Sarah lives with a caretaker and friend named Bettina. Sarah feels she has little talent but surrounds herself with people who do. As a young girl Sarah left Ruth alone to deal with sick relatives.

Ruth resented Sarah for both these reasons and they stayed out of touch for decades. The two finally reconcile after Ruth attends a self-help seminar and Sarah returns from Spain. Sarah feels a strong connection to Claire, whom she believes is a true artist. She invites Claire to her house in Topanga and they spend a weekend together. She sends Claire magic mushrooms on her birthday to help inspire her artistic passion. Ruth discovers that Sarah has developed a drug addiction to the pain killer Vicodin.

He is Ruth's lover for almost two years. Nikolai is in serious debt which culminates several encounters with a Russian mob. When they break his legs because he is unable to repay his debt, he recuperates at the Fishers' house. Ruth takes this as an opportunity to expand their relationship, but instead causes more tension when she pays off Nikolai's debt with Nathaniel's life insurance policy. Several weeks after their break-up, Ruth resigns from Blossom d'Amour so that she can spend more time with her newborn grandchild, Maya. Nikolai had a son and wife who died before he moved to the U.S. He has a brief cameo in episode #5.9 (\"Ecotone\") when Ruth envisions herself shooting all of her ex-lovers with a rifle to the tune of carnival music in a bloodless shooting gallery.\n\nGabriel \"Gabe\" Dimas (1983–2002), played by Eric Balfour, is Claire's boyfriend during her senior year in high school.

When she runs into him at another showing, he tells her he had been hit by a car, and that while most believe he's in love with fellow student/artist, Jimmy (to whom he gave a drunken blow job), he confides in Claire that he's merely jealous and wishes he could be as talented as she.

Dover was a scholar at the University of Cambridge in 1595, possibly as a sizar at Queens' College: during his time at Cambridge the \"Gog Magog Games\" were held on the Gog Magog Hills outside Cambridge, although it is not known whether these were already being termed \"Olympik\" as was the case by 1620. Dover left university early to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy, and a Robert Dover was among those questioned by Lord Burghley's officers looking for recusants in Norfolk. On 27 February 1605 Dover was admitted to Gray's Inn, and was probably called to the bar in 1611. Dover was known as a wit, and author of a lost poem \"The Wandering Jew\": according to Peter Heylin, a pageant put on at Gray's Inn. In 1611 he moved to Saintbury, near Chipping Campden. After the inauguration of the Games, he obtained patronage from neighbour Endymion Porter, a well-connected courtier, who arranged for Dover to receive a cast-off set of royal garments to wear while presiding. Later in life he moved to Barton-on-the-Heath.\n\nDover founded his annual Games held in the Cotwsold hills above Chipping Campden in about 1612, and presided over them for forty years. A mixture of courtly and folk events, the Cotswold Olimpicks were so named in \"Annalia Dubrensia\", one of a series of literary celebrations of the events. The games consisted of cudgel-playing, wrestling, running at the quintain, jumping, casting the bar and hammer, hand-ball, gymnastics, rural dances and games and horse-racing, the winners in which received valuable prizes. The Games were interrupted by the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642. Revived after the Restoration, the Games continued until 1852, and were again revived in 1965.\n\nIn 1610 Dover married Sibilla Sanford, daughter of William Cole, Dean of Lincoln and widow of John Sanford of Stow on the Wold; they had two sons (Robert, died in infancy, and John, 1614–1696) and two daughters (Sibella and Abigail). Robert Dover was buried at Barton on 24 July 1652(the date of 6 June 1641 appears to be a mistake).\n\nThere is a monument to Robert Dover at Dover's Hill, near Aston-sub-Edge.\n"}

It was nominated for the 1964 Hugo Award for Short Fiction.\n\nThe story is narrated by a gifted human linguist and poet named Gallinger, who is part of a mission studying Mars. He becomes the first human to learn the \"high language\" of the intelligent Martians, and to be allowed to read their sacred texts. He comes to believe that Martian culture is essentially fatalistic, following an event in the distant past that left the long-lived Martians sterile.\n\nThe Martian high priestess regards Gallinger highly, and over the course of months, his theological and poetical discussion elevate him to a status something like a prophet. Ultimately, he is seduced by a Martian temple dancer and impregnates her, the first such pregnancy on the planet in hundreds of years. The Martians appear not to take this well, as it contradicts their religion's expectation of extinction.\n\nGallinger sets out to do two things: he translates the Biblical book of Ecclesiastes, which he finds thematically similar to their religious texts, into the High Tongue. As part of the cultural exchange he engages in with the High Priestess, he promises to bring her a rose, since the Martians have never seen one. The ship's biologist grows a rose and gives it to Gallinger. \n\nIn anger at Martian religious fatalism and impassioned by his love for the dancer and his child-to-be, Gallinger breaks into the temple during a closed service and reads to the Martians from his translation of Ecclesiastes. He mocks it as he reads it, stating:\n\nHe discovers that the Martian religion is more complicated than he had originally realized, as is his role in fulfilling prophecy. It has been prophesied that a stranger will \"go shod in the temple\", breaking in without removing all unclean items, restoring life to the Martian race and bringing something new. His actions have brought life, and the High Priestess takes the rose vowing to learn how to grow the flower.\n\nThe story ends well for the Martians, though perhaps less so for Gallinger, who discovers his dancer was only fulfilling her religious duty by seducing him, not caring for him otherwise. He attempts suicide, but, when he wakes up, he is in the infirmary, and he sees Mars through a port, growing farther away as the ship leaves Mars to return to Earth.\n\n\"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\" has been anthologized several times, including in \"Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories #25\" (edited by Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg), \"The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth, and Other Stories\", and \"Science Fiction: The Science Fiction Research Association Anthology\" (edited by Patricia S. Warrick, Charles Waugh, and Martin H. Greenberg). It is regarded as one of Zelazny's best early stories and was included in \"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964\", an anthology of the greatest science fiction short stories prior to 1965, as judged by the Science Fiction Writers of America. \n\nR. D. Mullen termed the story \"perhaps the best story ever on Mars as a dying world\". Judith Merril praised it as \"incomparable\". Samuel R. Delany characterized \"Rose\" as a \"wonderful and magical tale\". \"The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century Literature in English\" declares the story \"rewrote the cliches of science fiction into augurs of renewal\". Theodore Sturgeon called the story \"one of the most beautifully written, skillfully composed and passionately expressed works of art to appear anywhere, ever.\"\n\n\"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\" was included in \"Visions of Mars: First Library on Mars\", a silica glass mini-DVD taken to Mars by the Phoenix Mars Lander in 2008.\n"}

He committed suicide in exile at Rhodes after being proscribed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla shortly after the latter's victory in the civil war.\n\nA member of the plebeian and a novus homo, Gaius Norbanus first came to prominence when he was elected one of the plebeian tribunes for 103 BC. He achieved notoriety for his prosecution of Quintus Servilius Caepio the Elder, where he accused Servilius Caepio of incompetence and dereliction of duty at the catastrophic defeat of the Roman armies by the Cimbri at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC. At the \"concilium plebis\" where Servilius Caepio was tried, two tribunes attempted to veto proceedings, but were driven off by force. Although the Senate vigorously tried to obtain his acquittal and he was defended by Lucius Licinius Crassus, Norbanus managed to secure Caepio’s conviction. Caepio was forced into exile to Smyrna, while his fortune was confiscated.\n\nIn 101 BC, Norbanus served as quaestor under Marcus Antonius, grandfather of the triumvir Mark Antony, in his campaign against the pirates in Cilicia. In 94 BC, Norbanus was accused of \"minuta maiestas\" (treason) under the \"Lex Appuleia\" by Publius Sulpicius Rufus on account of the disturbances that had taken place at the trial of Caepio, but the eloquence of Marcus Antonius secured his acquittal.\n\nThis was followed by his election as Praetor in 89 BC, and his appointment as governor of Sicily. He kept the peace in his province, defending it against the Italian \"socii\" during the Social War. He managed to capture Rhegium from the Samnites in 88 BC.\n\nDuring the civil war between Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla he sided with Marius. He was elected consul for 83 BC; at Mount Tifata, near Capua, he intercepted Sulla, who had returned to Italy from Greece. Sulla sent over some emissaries to discuss coming to terms with Norbanus, but they were thrown out when it became apparent that they were trying to suborn Norbanus’ men, who were mostly raw recruits. Although Norbanus was helped by Quintus Sertorius, they were defeated by Sulla at the Battle of Mount Tifata, losing around 6,000 men in the process. He managed to regroup his shattered army at Capua, whereupon he eventually retreated to Cisalpine Gaul. He and Gnaeus Papirius Carbo were defeated by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius at Faventia. Norbanus was betrayed by one of his legates, Publius Tullius Albinovanus, who murdered many of Norbanus’ principal officers after inviting them to dinner before surrendering Ariminium to Metellus Pius.\n\nNorbanus himself did not attend Albinovanus' invitation, and he managed to evade capture, fleeing to Rhodes. After proscription by Sulla, he committed suicide in the middle of a market-place, while the leading citizens of Rhodes were debating whether to hand him over to Sulla's men.\n\n"}

For 20 years, she was the muse of French poet and art critic Charles Baudelaire. They met in 1842 when Duval left Haiti for France, and the two remained together, albeit stormily, for the next two decades. Duval is said to have been the woman whom Baudelaire loved most in his life after his mother. She was born in Haiti on an unknown date, sometime around 1820.\n\nPoems of Baudelaire's that are dedicated to Duval or pay her homage include \"Le balcon\" (The Balcony), \"Parfum exotique\" (Exotic Perfume), \"La chevelure\" (The Hair), \"Sed non satiata\" (Yet she is not satisfied), \"Le serpent qui danse\" (The Dancing Serpent), and \"Une charogne\" (A Carcass).\n\nBaudelaire called her \"mistress of mistresses\" and his \"Vénus Noire\" (\"Black Venus\"), and it is believed that Duval symbolized to him the dangerous beauty, sexuality, and mystery of a Creole woman in mid-19th century France. She lived at 6, rue de la Femme-sans-tête (Street of the Headless Woman), near the Hôtel Pimodan.\n\nÉdouard Manet, a friend of Baudelaire, painted Duval in his 1862 painting \"Baudelaire's Mistress, Reclining\". She was, by this time, going blind.\n\nDuval may have died of syphilis as early as 1862, five years before Baudelaire, who also died of syphilis. Other sources claim that Duval survived Baudelaire. Nadar claimed to have seen Duval, last, in 1870—by this time she was on crutches, suffering heavily from syphilis.\n\nJeanne Duval serves as a main character in Caribbean author Nalo Hopkinson's \"The Salt Roads\", a work of historic fiction, and in the title story of the collection \"Black Venus\" by Angela Carter. Tinge Krishnan's film \"My Heart Laid Bare\" is about the life of Jeanne Duval.\n\nThe noted American conceptual artist Lorraine O'Grady developed a 16-diptych photo-installation featuring paired images of Charles Baudelaire and Jeanne Duval titled \"Flowers of Evil and Good\". Preliminary studies for this installation have been exhibited in the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, the Thomas Erben Gallery, New York, and Galerie Fotohof in Salzburg, Austria. O'Grady has written extensively about the relationship of Baudelaire and Duval in \"Mousse Magazine\" and \"Pétunia: magazine féministe d’art contemporain et de loisirs\".\n\nScottish artist Maud Sulter created several artworks inspired by Duval, using images such as her photograph by Nadar, and self-portraits of the artist. Many of these were displayed in a solo show at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery titled \"Jeanne Duval: A Melodrama\". \n\nIn addition, Jeanne Duval is the inspiration for a song titled \"Street of Roses\" by then-Soviet heavy metal band Aria on the 1987 album \"Hero of Asphalt\".\n\n"}

As a poet, he published more than a hundred poems. He was born in Jiayingzhou, now Mei County, Guangdong, and died 57 years later in the same place. His game-changing contributions to China made him a recognised figure of his time, and a namesake foundation has been established in his honour. Huang's former residence is now marked as a public museum.\n\nHuang was born May 29, 1848 in Jiayingzhou (now Mei County), Guangdong, China to a family of Hakka heritage. His father Huang Hung Chow was a scholar-official (Juren or 举人) and served the courts of the Qing dynasty. At age three, he witnessed the effects of the greatest land reforms in China. As a toddler, the younger Huang could recite the famous Chinese anthology \"Thousand Families Poems\" () and as a nine-year-old child studied poems from the Tang dynasty. His life took a turn a few years later, during the Taiping Rebellion, when he was robbed of many of his possessions. He applied to be a \"Juren\", like his father, when he became of age in 1877. Despite heavy competition, he found success and was posted to Tokyo, Japan to serve as the Imperial Chinese Embassy's Counsellor. In September 1880, he published \"Korea Strategy\" a paper regarding the high level plans of Korea (unified as it then was). Huang suggested that China and Korea become good allies. The work is described by one source as \"a work of destiny that \ndetermined the modern history of East Asia\". While in Japan, he did some editorial work for the \"Japan World Magazine\", looked into aspects of the medicine of the country, and noted how much the country had progressed through time and published his studies in a book, \"Treatises on Japan\" (printed 1890). The Guangxu Emperor was fascinated with the work and invited Huang to detailedly explain it to him in person. It was partially because of Huang's book that the Guangxu Emperor amended some rules in China. Huang is also considered to be a philosopher, having analysed, discussed, and questioned the framework of China. His influences in philosophy included the Enlightenment figures Rousseau and Montesquieu.\n\nAfterwards in 1882, Huang was assigned as Consul-General in San Francisco, United States. During his time there, he realised how wealthy the immigrant Chinese had become, and how much of an asset they were to China. Huang wrote a poem about Frederick Bee, an official at the Chinese Consulate. After seven years in the United States, he moved back to his home country China. In 1890, he relocated to London to act as the Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy; one year later he was reassigned to Singapore to become the Consul-General there. He witnessed how similar the Singaporean Chinese, both rich and generous, were to the native Chinese. Disagreeing with China's policy of not allowing overseas Chinese to return to the country, and torturing them if they did so, Huang composed a formal request to the Emperor to do away with the rule, offering the view that China was \"driv[ing] fish into other people's nets\". The request was accepted and on January 29, 1894, it was announced that the Chinese overseas were no longer barred from returning to China. In between, Huang was Hunan Province's Salt Intendant and he started the \"Journal for Contemporary Affairs\". The change of policy was widely celebrated and reported; Huang was soon to be appointed China's ambassador to Japan. However, before that could materialize, the ruler of China changed from the Guangxu Emperor to the Xuantong Emperor (see Hundred Days' Reform). With the Guangxu Emperor detained, Huang's career as a diplomat ended. He slammed Empress Dowager Cixi's coup but at the same time expressed his relief at being freed of his diplomatic duties.\n\nHuang had a few takes on race. As a teenager he expressed that every person \"is made from yellow clay\". Decades later he asked, \"Why is the yellow race not the only race in the world?\" Huang enjoyed penning poems. He was also patriotic towards China, and once described it as a gold-paved nation. He was well-liked as a poet and his poetry works received positive criticism, with one source citing him as \"the most distinguished poet among the late nineteenth-century reformers\". His influences in poetry included Wei Yuan, Gong Zizhen, and Jin He. His grandmother was a Lady Li, whose death when Huang was still a child supposedly put him in \"deep sorrow\", as evidenced in a poem pertaining to Li's tomb. Most of Huang's poems relate to world affairs of his time, including foreign ones, such as the presidential elections in the United States. In total, he published more than a hundred poems. After he died, an anthology of his poems, \"Poems of the Human Environment\" (), was published and remains popular in China. A proponent of the late Qing Poetic Revolution, select poems of his include: \"The Mountain Song\", \"The Cherry Blossom Festival\", \"The Fog of London\", \"Songs of the Taiping Rebels\", \"On The Road to Wuqing\", and \"Expelling the Visitor\". In his lifetime, he also showed an interest in opening schools in various countries in Asia. Huang and Liang Qichao were close friends. Huang extensively toured many parts of Asia, his favourite being Malaysia. His nephew, Parkcane C. Hwang, was the founder and manager of the Bank of China in Singapore.\n\nEvading arrest following the change of ruler of China, Huang fled to his hometown of Jiayingzhou, where he died on March 28, 1905, aged 58. Huang is remembered for saying the famous and often-quoted line when he was twenty years old, \"我手写我口，古岂能拘牵!\", which roughly means that it is perfectly fine to express one's feelings whenever one feels like it. Huang is credited as the \"first Chinese to use the word 文明 to mean civilisation\", a term which he made use of in one of his poetry works. His body is as of 2013 missing, having been thrown into a dumpster following looting of his tomb. The Huang Zun Xian Foundation, based in Hong Kong, has listed finding the body of Huang as one of its missions. One source credits Huang as \"the first Chinese diplomat and scholar who championed for human rights for the early Chinese migrants\", whilst another exalts him as \"one of the most famous authors of late nineteenth-century China\". An exhibition honoring the achievements of Huang was held in January 1991. It featured artistic depictions of him by some 130 various artists. Huang's former abode in Mei County has been converted into a museum and a local government-promoted tourist destination. It is cited as a \"key preservation unit of cultural relic\" and an exemplification of the \"beauty of the Lingnan-style garden\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2301923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301923", "title": "Power of appointment", "text": "Power of appointment\n\nA power of appointment is a term most frequently used in the law of wills to describe the ability of the testator (the person writing the will) to select a person who will be given the authority to dispose of certain property under the will. Although any person can exercise this power at any time during their life, its use is rare outside of a will. The power is divided into two broad categories: general powers of appointment and special powers of appointment. The holder of a power of appointment differs from the trustee of a trust in that the former has no obligation to manage the property for the generation of income, but need only distribute it.\n\n\"Example: \"I leave my video game collection to be distributed as my son Andrew sees fit.\"\"\n\nA general power of appointment is defined for federal estate tax purposes in the Internal Revenue Code §2041. A general power of appointment is one which allows the holder of the power to appoint to himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his or her estate the right to have the beneficial use and enjoyment of certain property covered by the power of appointment. The holder of a general power of appointment is treated for estate tax purposes as if he or she is the owner of the property subject to the power, whether or not the power is exercised. Thus, the property which is subject to the power is includable in the power holder's estate for estate tax purposes.\n\nA general power of appointment is a key element of a type of marital deduction tax law as prescribed in Internal Revenue Code §2056(b)(5). It is a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction, provided that the surviving spouse is given the income at least annually and the surviving spouse has a general power of appointment over the trust property remaining at his death.\n\nMost general powers of appointment are exercisable under a will. The holder of the power refers to the document creating the power in his or her will and designates who among the permissible objects of the power should receive the property. The power could be exercised by creating further trusts.\n\nIf the power of appointment is not exercised, the default provision of the document that created the power takes over.\n\n\"Example: \"I leave my cactus collection to my children, my wife Pat to choose who receives which cactus.\"\"\n\nA special power of appointment allows the recipient to distribute the designated property among a specified group or class of people, not including donee, donee's estate, creditors of donee, or creditors of donee's estate. For example, a testator might grant his brother the special power to distribute property among the testator's three children. The brother would then have the authority to choose which of the testator's children gets which property. Unlike a general power of appointment, the refusal of the appointed party to exercise a specific power of appointment causes the designated property to revert as a gift to the members of a group or a class.\n\nA special power of appointment may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If exclusive, the donee can appoint all the property to one or more members of the class of permissible appointees to the exclusion of the other members of the class. If nonexclusive, the donee must appoint some property to each object.\n\nSpecial powers of appointment also appear in the context of a trust and are primarily used to reduce liability for generation-skipping transfer tax, or to provide asset protection trust features without fraudulent conveyance liability. Such trusts are referred to as SPA Trusts.\n\nIn addition to general and special powers, donors may limit when the power may be exercised by the donees. Testamentary powers are usually indicated by the inclusion of limiting language in the granting instrument such as \"to B for life, remainder to persons as B shall 'by will' appoint\". General powers presently exercisable do not contain such limitations on power. Wording such as \"to B for life, and upon B's death to those that B shall appoint\" indicates a power presently exercisable, not a testamentary power.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the donee's creditors cannot reach the appointive property when the donee has a presently exercisable power of appointment as long as the power is unexercised.\n"}

He was survived by his wife, Betty Mae Chapman Schmitz.\n\nSchmitz wrote mostly short stories, which sold chiefly to \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" and \"Astounding Science-Fiction\" (which later became \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\"). \"Gale Biography in Context\" called him \"a craftsmanlike writer who was a steady contributor to science fiction magazines for over 20 years.\"\n\nSchmitz is best known as a writer of \"space opera\", and for his strong female characters (such as Telzey Amberdon and Trigger Argee) who did not conform to the \"damsel in distress\" stereotype typical of science fiction of the time.\n\nHis first published story was \"Greenface\", published in August 1943 in \"Unknown\".\n\nMost of his works are part of the \"Hub\" series. However, the novel that \"is usually thought of as Schmitz's best work\" is \"The Witches of Karres\", concerning juvenile \"witches\" with genuine psi-powers and their escape from slavery. \"The Witches of Karres\" was nominated for a Hugo Award. In recent years, his novels and short stories have been republished by Baen Books, edited and with notes by Eric Flint.\n\nIn an introductory essay comparing Schmitz with contemporary author A. E. van Vogt, Dozois wrote, \"Although he lacked van Vogt's paranoid tension and ornately Byzantine plots, the late James H. Schmitz was considerably better at \"people\" than van Vogt was, crafting even his villains as complicated, psychologically complex, and non-stereotypical characters, full of surprising quirks and behaviors that you didn't see in a lot of other Space Adventure stuff.\"\n\nDozois added:\n\nJohn Clute writes in \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\",\n\nGreg Fowlkes, editor-in-chief of Resurrected Press, said, \"During the 50s and 60s \"Space Opera\" and James H. Schmitz were almost synonymous. He was famous for his tales of interstellar secret agents and galactic criminals, and particularly for heroines such as Telzey Amberdon and Trigger Argee. Many of these characters had enhanced \"psionic\" powers that let them use their minds as well as their weapons to foil their enemies. All of them were resourceful in the best heroic tradition.\"\n\nIn an essay in the anthology \"The Good Old Stuff\" (1998), Dozois laments that the book \"Agent of Vega\" is \"long out-of-print, alas, but one which – if you can find it – delivers as pure a jolt of Widescreen Space Opera Sense of wonder as can be found anywhere.\" However, the website Free Speculative Fiction Online freely offers \"Agent of Vega\", along with several of Schmitz's other stories, including \"Greenface\", \"Balanced Ecology\", \"Lion Loose\", \"Goblin Night\", and many more.\n\nSchmitz wrote the introduction to the concordance \"The Universes of E. E. Smith\".\n\nGardner Dozois has said, in prefacing the Schmitz tale \"The Second Night of Summer\", in which humans on the planet Noorhut face an attack from aliens and are, unbeknownst to themselves, saved by the actions of a single woman with psi powers, Granny Wannattel, with the sole help of a friendly alien she calls her pony:\n\nWith his popular equality-between-the-sexes fiction, Schmitz eased the way for later writers such as Joanna Russ, James Tiptree, Jr., Kit Reed, Connie Willis, Sheri S. Tepper, and other science fiction authors who used female protagonists and feminine point-of-view more than half the time. Of \"The Second Night of Summer\", Dozois went on to write, \"the hero of the piece is not only a woman, but an \"old\" woman ... a choice that most adventure writers wouldn't even make \"now\", in 1998, let alone in 1950, which is when Schmitz made it!\"\n\nMercedes Lackey places her first meeting with science fiction at age 10 or 11, when she happened to pick up her father's copy of James H. Schmitz's \"Agent of Vega\".\n\nListed chronologically, with month and year of publication, as well as the magazine, listed in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\nListed by title, with chronological publishing list.\n\n"}

It was painted in 1882 and exhibited at the Paris Salon of that year. It depicts a scene in the Folies Bergère nightclub in Paris. The painting originally belonged to the composer Emmanuel Chabrier, a close friend of Manet, and hung over his piano. It is now in the Courtauld Gallery in London. \n\nThe painting exemplifies Manet's commitment to Realism in its detailed representation of a contemporary scene. Many features have puzzled critics but almost all of them have been shown to have a rationale, and the painting has been the subject of numerous popular and scholarly articles.\n\nThe central figure stands before a mirror, although critics—accusing Manet of ignorance of perspective and alleging various impossibilities in the painting—have debated this point since the earliest reviews were published. In 2000, however, a photograph taken from a suitable point of view of a staged reconstruction was shown to reproduce the scene as painted by Manet. According to this reconstruction, \"the conversation that many have assumed was transpiring between the barmaid and gentleman is revealed to be an optical trick—the man stands outside the painter's field of vision, to the left, and looks away from the barmaid, rather than standing right in front of her.\" As it appears, the observer should be standing to the right and closer to the bar than the man whose reflection appears at the right edge of the picture. This is an unusual departure from the central point of view usually assumed when viewing pictures drawn according to perspective. \n\nAsserting the presence of the mirror has been crucial for many modern interpreters. It provides a meaningful parallel with \"Las Meninas\", a masterpiece by an artist Manet admired, Diego Velázquez. There has been a considerable development of this topic since Michel Foucault broached it in his book \"The Order of Things\" (1966).\n\nThe art historian Jeffrey Meyers describes the intentional play on perspective and the apparent violation of the operations of mirrors: \"Behind her, and extending for the entire length of the four-and-a-quarter-foot painting, is the gold frame of an enormous mirror. The French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty has called a mirror 'the instrument of a universal magic that changes things into spectacles, spectacles into things, me into others, and others into me.' We, the viewers, stand opposite the barmaid on the other side of the counter and, looking at the reflection in the mirror, see exactly what she sees... A critic has noted that Manet's 'preliminary study shows her placed off to the right, whereas in the finished canvas she is very much the centre of attention.' Though Manet shifted her from the right to the center, he kept her reflection on the right. Seen in the mirror, she seems engaged with a customer; in full face, she's self-protectively withdrawn and remote.\"\n\nThe painting is rich in details which provide clues to social class and milieu. The woman at the bar is a real person, known as Suzon, who worked at the Folies-Bergère in the early 1880s. For his painting, Manet posed her in his studio. By including a dish of oranges in the foreground, Manet identifies the barmaid as a prostitute, according to art historian Larry L. Ligo, who says that Manet habitually associated oranges with prostitution in his paintings. T.J. Clark says that the barmaid is \"intended to represent one of the prostitutes for which the Folies-Bergère was well-known\", who is represented \"as both a salesperson and a commodity—something to be purchased along with a drink.\"\n\nOther notable details include the pair of green feet in the upper left-hand corner, which belong to a trapeze artist who is performing above the restaurant's patrons. The beer bottles depicted are easily identified by the red triangle on the label as Bass Pale Ale, and the conspicuous presence of this English brand instead of German beer has been interpreted as documentation of anti-German sentiment in France in the decade after the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nThe 1934 ballet \"Bar aux Folies-Bergère\" with choreography by Ninette de Valois and music of Chabrier was created from, and based around, Manet's painting. The 1947 film \"The Private Affairs of Bel Ami\" faithfully references \"A Bar at the Folies-Bergère\" twenty nine minutes into the film with a look-alike actress, set and props as the main characters enter the establishment.\n\nThe painting was the inspiration of a song (possibly by Sydney Carter) in the popular theatre production \"The Lyric Revue\", in London in 1951. The refrain went \"Oh, how I long to be Back in my dear Brittany ... But fate has chosen me For the bar at the Folies-Bergères\".\n\nThe painting \"The Bar\" (1954) by Australian artist John Brack, which depicts a comparatively grim and austere Melbourne bar-room scene, is an ironic reference to \"A Bar at the Folies-Bergère\".\n\nIn the 1988 Eddie Murphy film \"Coming To America\", during the party scene at McDowell's house, there is a spoof on the painting above the couch, in which the central female figure is replaced with a dark-skinned woman instead.\n\nCanadian artist Jeff Wall makes reference to \"A Bar at the Folies-Bergère\" in his work \"Picture for Women\" (1979). The Tate Modern wall text for \"Picture of Women\", from the 2005–2006 exhibition \"Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004\", outlines the influence of Manet's painting: \n\nIn Manet's painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, observed by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene appears to be reflected in the mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet's barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer's role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet's painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n"}

Among the world's best players in the mid-1930s, he won two PGA Championships, and is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Runyan was also a golf instructor.\n\nBorn in Hot Springs, Arkansas, Runyan started out as a caddie and then an apprentice at a golf course in his hometown, before turning pro at age 17. He was head professional at a Little Rock club by age 18. Runyan served as head pro at Metropolis Country Club in White Plains, New York from 1931 to 1943 during which time he won both of his PGA championships.\n\nThree years later, Runyan defeated Wood in extra holes in the title match of the 1934 PGA Championship, the first of his two PGA Championships. Of Runyan's 29 career PGA Tour wins, 16 of them came in 1933 and 1934, and his nine wins in 1933 make him one of only seven golfers to win nine or more times in one year on the PGA Tour. In the first Masters Tournament in 1934, he was paired for the first 36 holes with tournament host Bobby Jones. Runyan won the tour money title in 1934, and was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team in 1933 and 1935.\n\nRunyan was competitive for many years; he won the PGA Championship again in 1938 and led the U.S. Open after three rounds as late as 1951. In the finals of his 1938 PGA, Runyan defeated Sam Snead 8 and 7, the most lopsided title match ever in the event, conducted as match play through 1957. This was despite Snead's vastly greater length off the tee, as much as per hole.\n\nFellow golfers nicknamed him \"Little Poison\" (a take on 1930s baseball player Lloyd Waner, who had the same nickname), primarily because he did not drive the ball very far, but also because he had a terrific short game. Runyan had worked tirelessly on his short game from boyhood, since he realized early on if he were to succeed in golf, he had to compensate for his lack of length. Runyan opined that he is the smallest player in golf history who had significant success, although Fred McLeod had a fine record, too, and stood only and weighed a paltry .\n\nRunyan's teaching prowess led many top pros to him over his 75 years of teaching, including Gene Littler, Phil Rodgers, Chuck Courtney, Frank Beard, Jim Ferree and Mickey Wright. \"Golf Magazine\" wrote: \"... since the late 1930s, he has probably been the most influential short game instructor. Untold thousands have been taught his methods for putting and chipping.\" Runyan wrote an influential book outlining his short-game methods, \"The Short Way to Lower Scoring\". In 2000, he astoundingly completed the annual Par 3 competition held one day before the Masters at the age of 91. He died in Palm Springs, California.\n\nRunyan was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1990.

It is one of the largest and busiest ports on the Eastern Mediterranean. The Port of Beirut and Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport are the main ports of entry into the country.\n\nThe port is operated and managed by the Gestion et exploitation du port de Beyrouth (GEPB), which is French for Port Authority of Beirut. Container terminal operations are subcontracted to a private consortium called the Beirut Container Terminal Consortium (BCTC).\n\nSince the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 1990, the port has gone through a major updating and expansion program with the rehabilitation of existing port facilities, the construction of new administration buildings, and the construction of a new container terminal.\n\nIt's an important gateway for transporting freight to Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf States.\n\nThe Port of Beirut has a total area of 1,200,000m and has 4 basins, 16 quays, and a new container terminal at quay 16 capable of handling per year.\n\nThe Free Zone includes three industrial buildings with warehouses covering a total area of 32,400m and a commercial building with 46 duty-free shops covering an area of 11,200m. In 2007, the Logistic Free Zone (LFZ) was established containing several logistics warehouses where goods can undergo transformations before being exported via land, sea, and air or imported into Lebanon.\n\nThe general cargo area consists of 12 warehouses and a grain silo with a capacity of 120,000 tons of grain.\n\nThe Port of Beirut has been selected as a transshipment hub for the second and third largest container shipping companies in the world, Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and French-based Compagnie Maritime d’Affrètement - Compagnie Générale Maritime (CMA-CGM). The latter building a $12 million regional headquarters building near the port.\n\nThe passenger terminal is located along quay 5 facing the second basin of the port. The facility was deemed outdated and inadequate, so it is being reconstructed into a modern 600m facility that will have a decorative front sail structure. It is scheduled for completion early this year.\n\nThe historic first basin of the port, which hosts the Beirut Naval Base, will be completely redeveloped by Solidere, the $2 billion Lebanese real estate company that is rebuilding the Beirut Central District (BCD). The redevelopment will involve transforming quays 1 and 2 into a public promenade along with the construction of leisure commercial properties.\n\nThe port lacks a railway connection, however, as part of long term plans to reinstate the railway system in Lebanon, plans are to have a railway link to the port.\nManagement and operation of the container terminal is subcontracted to the Beirut Container Terminal Consortium (BCTC) which is made up of the Lebanese-based International Port Management Beirut (IPMB), British-based Portia Management Services (PMS), and American-based Logistics and Port Management, Americas (LPMA). It was established in December 2004 and began operations in 2005, although the container terminal facilities were completed in 2000.\n\nThe majority of container traffic is handled by the new quay 16, the longest and deepest of all the quays at a length of 600m and a draft of 15.5m allowing it to accommodate the largest container ships in the world. It has a stacking area of 365,000m allowing it to process up to 745,000 TEU per year.\n\nQuay 16 is equipped with 6 Super-post-Panamax container cranes and 18 rubber tyred gantry cranes manufactured by Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industry Company (ZPMC).\n\nDue to the very high traffic the container terminal is experiencing, the BCTC reached an agreement with the port authority to utilize the older quays 12, 13, and 14 for handling smaller container ships when quay 16 is occupied. This allows the container terminal to process up to 1,200,000 TEU per year and reduce vessel wait times. Container ships that are processed at these older quays as well as quay 15 have their containers loaded and unloaded by two mobile harbour cranes manufactured by Gottwald Port Technology.\n\nThe first phase of the container terminal expansion was launched last year and involves expanding quay 16 by 500m to the east reaching the mouth of the Beirut River by reclaiming 140,000m of land creating a new 180,000m stacking area for containers. This will extend the quay from its present 600m to 1,100m. The draft along the expanded quay will be 17.5m. The existing detached breakwater for quay 16 will also be extended. The expansion will increase the container terminal capacity by 450,000 TEU allowing the terminal to process 1,500,000 TEU per year. The Danish-Lebanese joint venture, Pihl-Hourie, won the contract for the expansion project which will cost $128 million and be completed in 2012.\n\nOnce the first phase is completed in 2012, the second phase will be launched which will involve filling in the 4th basin of the port, bridging quays 12 and 16, creating a continuous 2,300m long quay increasing the container terminal capacity by 600,000 TEU allowing the terminal to process 2,100,000 TEU per year.\n\nSee Marine environmental issues in Lebanon\n\n"}

He then toured for five years as aa member of the folksinging duo, \"The Saxons\", before writing the music for and appearing in the off-Broadway musical \"Hark!\".\n\nGoggin began composing both music and lyrics for revues satirizing current events, trends, and personalities. He later composed incidental music for the short-lived 1976 Broadway production, \"Legend\", starring Elizabeth Ashley and F. Murray Abraham, which closed after five performances.\n\nGoggin's early life experiences, including schooling by the Marywood Dominican Sisters and his days as a seminarian, influenced him to create his greatest success. A line of greeting cards featuring a nun offering tart quips caught on so quickly that Goggin decided to expand the concept into a cabaret show called \"The Nunsense Story\", which opened for a four-day run at Manhattan's Duplex and remained for 38 weeks, encouraging its creator to expand it into a full-length theater production.\n\nWhat followed was \"Nunsense\" (1985), one of off-Broadway's biggest commercial successes, which ran a total of 3672 performances. By the time it closed, it had become an international phenomenon translated into 21 languages with more than 5000 productions worldwide. Goggin followed it with six sequels, \"Nunsense 2: The Second Coming\", \"Sister Amnesia's Country Western Nunsense Jamboree\", \"Nuncrackers: The Nunsense Christmas Musical\", \"Meshuggah-Nuns!\", \"Nunsensations: The Nunsense Vegas Revue\", and \"Nunset Boulevard\". In 1998 Dan opened an all-male production of \"Nunsense\" entitled N\"unsense A-Men!\" The show played in New York City to rave reviews.\n\nGoggin also wrote the book, music, and lyrics for \"A One-Way Ticket To Broadway\" and \"Balancing Act\", neither of which was as successful as the \"Nunsense\" franchise.\n\n"}
{"id": "2301967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301967", "title": "Lorne (electoral district)", "text": "Lorne (electoral district)\n\nLorne was an electoral district that existed in the District of Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories from 1880 until 1888. The district was one of the first three electoral districts in the Territories. It was created by statutory proclamation in 1880. Of the three electoral districts proclaimed, it was the only one to actually have an election held in it.\n\nUnder the \"Northwest Territories Act 1880\" the district was mandated at its inception to return a single member to the Northwest Territories Legislature under the first past the post electoral system. The district was named in the honour of then-Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne. Lorne toured through the Northwest Territories just after the electoral district was created in 1881.\n\nThe electoral district ceased to exist following electoral redistribution before the 1888 Northwest Territories general election was called. The redistribution was due to a population boom in the area caused by an influx of settlers. The electoral district was redistributed and split between the electoral districts of Batoche and Prince Albert. During the nine years the district existed, it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three-year terms.\n\nThe electoral district was one of three proclaimed by Lieutenant-Governor David Laird on November 13, 1880, under the authority of the \"North-West Territories Act\". The other two electoral districts were Salisbury, named after the Marquess of Salisbury and Kimberley name after the Lord of Kimberley. Kimberley's contribution to the Northwest Territories was transferring the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to Canada on September 1, 1880.\n\nThe electoral district was created with the provision to cover an area of and have a population of 1000 electors. The major population centres in the electoral district at the time of creation were Prince Albert, and Fort Carlton. The land around the district boomed due to a high rate of settlement in that period. The cause of this was due to the possibility of the Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway line being built through the area.\n\nThe Northwest Territories political system used at this time was run by an early form of consensus government. Candidates stood for election independent of the political parties that exist in other provinces and territories and the federal level within Canada. The government had not yet developed to the point of being a Responsible government as the majority of members were appointed and not elected. The district was served by three representatives during its eight-year history.\n\nThe 1881 by-election held on March 23, 1881 was a pivotal milestone towards Responsible Government being attained in the Northwest Territories. The election marked the first time the provision of the \"North-West Territories Act 1880\" that allowed for an electoral district to be proclaimed if an area the size of had 1000 residents had been activated.\n\nThe election was conducted by voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who he was going to vote for and the results would be tallied. Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.\n\nThe election commenced when Lieutenant-Governor David Laird dropped the writ on 1881. The election was contested by two candidates, Lawrence Clarke who was a fur trader and Chief Factor of the District of Saskatchewan for the Hudson's Bay Company. Clarke's opponent was Henry Stewart Moore a local French speaking businessman from Prince Albert who had been operating a flour mill since 1875.\n\nClarke held a big advantage in the campaign as he was supported by the Métis who had been looking for someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870. Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member to sit on the Northwest Territories council.\n\nNearing the end of his term in office Clarke decided not to run for re-election in 1883. He was losing too much support due to his ties with the Hudson's Bay Company. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.\n\nAndrew Porter was famous for being the first registered private practicing medical doctor in the history of the Northwest Territories. He originally settled in Prince Albert in 1878.\nMacDowall campaigned by appealing to the concerns of the Métis who comprised the largest demographic in the district. He promised them that he would go to the Federal Government with their demands for better representation. He also helped win support by donating $1,100 out of pocket towards the construction of a new church for the community of Batoche. MacDowall's campaign efforts and donation proved to be very popular. \n\nMacDowall's appeal for representation translated into a landslide victory on election day. On June 5, 1883 he defeated Andrew Porter capturing nearly 70% of the popular vote. His win was the largest majority of the three elections held in the electoral district.\n\nThe official results for the race showed MacDowall won big in most of the polls, winning four out of five. Porter's support was concentrated in \"The Ridge\" where he won his only poll. MacDowall swept the south end of the district winning a shut out in the Métis communities of Duck Lake and St. Laurent de Grandin. Along with the shut out he held strong support in the rest of the riding, with his biggest single vote tally of votes coming from within the town of Prince Albert.\n\nThe 1885 election in this district was held on September 17, 1885 as part of the 1885 Northwest Territories election. This was the first major election held in the Northwest Territories. The election grouped together a number of old districts that had been coming up for renewal on their three-year cycle and by-elections in new districts that were created by a population boom of settlers moving into the territory.\nIncumbent MacDowall, had played a major role in subduing the North-West Rebellion at the end of his term in office. He would not run for re-election instead choosing to campaign for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Dr. Porter attempted to win a seat by running for office a second time. Porter was challenged by Captain Owen E. Hughes, a business man from Duck Lake. Hughes had been the captain of the Prince Albert militia unit that was disbanded by the Federal Government prior to the start of the North-West Resistance. Many of his former unit, including his lieutenant, Gabriel Dumont, were among the Metis who drove the loyalist forces back at the Battle of Fish Creek.\n\nOn election day, despite increasing his popular share of the vote over the 1883 election even with lower turnout, Porter was defeated by Hughes. The race was very tight and hotly contested nearly ending in a tie vote. Hughes captured the electoral district by a margin of eight votes winning just over 51% of the popular vote.\n\n"}

When a Commission Member's term is due to expire, a nomination election is held in the applicable district; five candidates for District Commission Member are nominated through votes cast by local hunters and anglers in each district, who must be licensed to hunt or fish. The five nominees receiving the most votes are sent to the Governor of Kentucky for appointment of one as District Commission Member.

It was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the Prometheus Award in 1990.\n\nThe novel follows a group of eleven immortals from the ancient past to the distant future. Most of the novel follows the various immortals throughout their lives as they try to find others like themselves, avoid being killed, and remain quiet about their gift. \nGradually, the immortals begin to meet across the world and form a family of sorts. After they share their secret of immortality with the rest of humanity, the ensuing years result in a human culture they no longer relate to or fit in with. Consequently, they create and crew a starship to explore new civilizations within the galaxy.\n\n\nAs their name implies, at a certain point Immortals stop outwardly aging, generally at about twenty-five years, though apparently among east-Asians possibly a little later. When Immortals' teeth are damaged, they regrow. Immortals receive no permanent scars and also never contract contagious illnesses, even during times of plague. They remain fertile for as long as they live and can rapidly heal broken bones or other serious wounds. If the Immortal men are circumcised, their foreskins will regenerate. Speculation on \"recurrent intactness\" among women is left unanswered, with the possibility of the female hymen likewise restoring itself having been brought up at one point during dialogue in the novel. Immortals can and in the course of the novel do die, as they are not capable of recovering from injuries such as a stab to the heart or decapitation. There is also discussion about whether long-term exposure to tobacco smoke might present the possibility of lung cancer developing, though the researcher who opens the possibility admits he has no data on the matter.\n\n\n"}

This classification is often referred to as Killing-Cartan classification. \n\nThe list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of simple Lie algebras and Riemannian symmetric spaces. See also the table of Lie groups for a smaller list of groups that commonly occur in theoretical physics, and the Bianchi classification for groups of dimension at most 3. \n\nUnfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition of a simple Lie group. In particular, it is not always defined as a Lie group that is simple as an abstract group. Authors differ on whether a simple Lie group has to be connected, or on whether it is allowed to have a non-trivial center, or on whether R is a simple Lie group. \n\nThe most common definition is that a Lie group is simple if it is connected, non-abelian, and every closed \"connected\" normal subgroup is either the identity or the whole group. In particular, simple groups are allowed to have a non-trivial center, but R is not simple. \n\nIn this article the connected simple Lie groups with trivial center are listed. Once these are known, the ones with non-trivial center are easy to list as follows. Any simple Lie group with trivial center has a universal cover, whose center is the fundamental group of the simple Lie group. The corresponding simple Lie groups with non-trivial center can be obtained as quotients of this universal cover by a subgroup of the center.\n\nThe Lie algebra of a simple Lie group is a simple Lie algebra. This is a one-to-one correspondence between connected simple Lie groups with trivial center and simple Lie algebras of dimension greater than 1. (Authors differ on whether the one-dimensional Lie algebra should be counted as simple.)\n\nOver the complex numbers the semisimple Lie algebras are classified by their Dynkin diagrams, of types \"ABCDEFG\". If \"L\" is a real simple Lie algebra, its complexification is a simple complex Lie algebra, unless \"L\" is already the complexification of a Lie algebra, in which case the complexification of \"L\" is a product of two copies of \"L\". This reduces the problem of classifying the real simple Lie algebras to that of finding all the real forms of each complex simple Lie algebra (i.e., real Lie algebras whose complexification is the given complex Lie algebra). There are always at least 2 such forms: a split form and a compact form, and there are usually a few others. The different real forms correspond to the classes of automorphisms of order at most 2 of the complex Lie algebra.\n\nSymmetric spaces are classified as follows. \n\nFirst, the universal cover of a symmetric space is still symmetric, so we can reduce to the case of simply connected symmetric spaces. (For example, the universal cover of a real projective plane is a sphere.)\n\nSecond, the product of symmetric spaces is symmetric, so we may as well just classify the irreducible simply connected ones (where irreducible means they cannot be written as a product of smaller symmetric spaces). \n\nThe irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces are the real line, and exactly two symmetric spaces corresponding to each \"non-compact\" simple Lie group \"G\",\none compact and one non-compact. The non-compact one is a cover of the quotient of \"G\" by a maximal compact subgroup \"H\", and the compact one is a cover of the quotient of\nthe compact form of \"G\" by the same subgroup \"H\". This duality between compact and non-compact symmetric spaces is a generalization of the well known duality between spherical and hyperbolic geometry.\n\nA symmetric space with a compatible complex structure is called Hermitian. The compact simply connected irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces fall into 4 infinite families with 2 exceptional ones left over, and each has a non-compact dual. In addition the complex plane is also a Hermitian symmetric space; this gives the complete list of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces.\n\nThe four families are the types A III, B I and D I for , D III, and C I, and the two exceptional ones are types E III and E VII of complex dimensions 16 and 27.\n\nformula_1  stand for the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions.\n\nIn the symbols such as \"E\" for the exceptional groups, the exponent −26 is the signature of an invariant symmetric bilinear form that is negative definite on the maximal compact subgroup. It is equal to the dimension of the group minus twice the dimension of a maximal compact subgroup.\n\nThe fundamental group listed in the table below is the fundamental group of the simple group with trivial center. \nOther simple groups with the same Lie algebra correspond to subgroups of this fundamental group (modulo the action of the outer automorphism group).\n\nThe following table lists some Lie groups with simple Lie algebras of small \ndimension. The groups on a given line all have the same Lie algebra. In the dimension 1 case, the groups are abelian and not simple.\n\n"}

Ellis' influence on the fashion industry has been called \"a huge turning point\" because he introduced new patterns and proportions to a market which was dominated by more traditional men's clothing.\n\nEllis was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, on March 3, 1940, the only child of Edwin and Winifred Rountree Ellis. His father owned a coal and home heating oil company, which enabled the family to live a comfortable middle-class life. Ellis graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1957. He then studied at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, and graduated with a degree in business administration in 1961. To avoid the draft, Ellis enlisted in the United States Coast Guard Reserve with service that included six months of active duty with the Coast Guard. He graduated from New York University with a master's degree in retailing in 1963.\n\nEllis started out in department store retailing in the Richmond, Virginia, area to gain experience in the fashion industry as a buyer and merchandiser at the department store Miller & Rhoads. While there, he was co-founder of Richmond retail shop \"A Sunny Day\". He later joined the sportswear company John Meyer of Norwich in New York City. Eventually, in the mid-1970s, he was approached by his then employer, The Vera Companies, famous for their polyester double-knit pantsuits, to design a fashion collection for them. Soon after that, Ellis presented his first women's sportswear line, called Portfolio, in November 1976. Although he could not sketch, he knew exactly how the industry worked and proved a master of innovative ideas who created 'new classics' that American women longed for at the time.\n\nEllis, together with The Vera Companies' parent company, Manhattan Industries, founded his own fashion house, Perry Ellis International, in 1978. He opened his showroom on New York's Seventh Avenue. As the company's chairman and head designer he later developed Perry Ellis Menswear Collection – marked by \"non-traditional, modern classics\". Step by step, he added shoes, accessories, furs and perfume that all bear his name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the company continued to expand and include various labels such as Perry Ellis Collection and Perry Ellis Portfolio. By 1982, the company had more than 75 staff. In 1984, Perry Ellis America was created in cooperation with Levi Strauss. In 1985, he revived his lesser-priced Portfolio product line. In the early 1980s, wholesale revenues had figured at about $60 million. By 1986 that number had risen to about $260 million.\n\nHighly praised professionally and personally, Ellis believed that \"fashion dies when you take it too seriously.\" Of Perry Ellis' fashion design, Michael Bastian remarked that \"no one did it better...He was able to be modern and yet not come off antiseptic,\" while Steven Kolb, CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, described Ellis' fashion as \"my way to step forward in fashion, but to still have a comfort level. It helped define my personality.\"\n\nEllis served as president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) from 1984 to 1986.\n\nIn 1981, Ellis began a relationship with attorney Laughlin Barker. Later that year, Ellis appointed Barker the President of the licensing division of Perry Ellis International. They remained together until Barker's death in January 1986.\n\nIn February 1984, Ellis and his long-time friend, television producer and writer Barbara Gallagher, conceived a child together via artificial insemination. Their daughter, Tyler Alexandra Gallagher Ellis, was born in November 1984. Ellis bought a home for Gallagher and their daughter in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and would visit frequently. In 2011, Tyler released her first line of handbags using the name Tyler Alexandra.\n\nIn October 1985, rumors that Ellis had contracted AIDS began to surface when he appeared on the runway at the end of his Fall fashion show. By that time, Ellis had lost a considerable amount of weight and looked much older. Around the same time, Ellis' partner Laughlin Barker was undergoing chemotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer that later metastasized to his lungs. Ellis continued to deny that he was sick, but rumors of his illness persisted after he passed out in the receiving line at a party at the Costume Institute in December 1985. On January 2, 1986, Barker died of lung cancer at the couple's home in Manhattan. After Barker's death, Ellis' health rapidly declined. By May 1986, Ellis had contracted viral encephalitis which caused paralysis on one side of his face. Despite his appearance, he insisted on appearing at his Fall fashion show held in New York City on May 8. At the end of the show, Ellis attempted to walk the runway for his final bow but was so weak, he had to be supported by two assistants. It was his final public appearance. Ellis was hospitalized soon after and slipped into a coma. He died of viral encephalitis on May 30, 1986. A spokesperson for Ellis' company would not comment on whether the designer's death was AIDS-related stating, \"Those were Perry's wishes.\"\n\nMost newspapers omitted the AIDS rumors from Ellis' obituary and simply attributed his death to encephalitis. In August 1986, \"New York\" magazine writer Patricia Morrisroe wrote a story about Ellis where she concluded that, \"...many people believe Ellis had AIDS, and given the evidence, it seems likely.\" A 1993 article from the Associated Press included Ellis among its list of better known AIDS victims.\n\nIn 1986, the annual Perry Ellis Award—now known as the Swarovski Emerging Talent Award—was created to honor emerging talents in the world of men's and women's fashion designers. The first designer to receive it was David Cameron.\n\nThough he worked as a designer for less than a decade, over 25 years after his death his work is \"still seen as incredibly influential.\"\n\nIn 1999, Miami-based textile company Supreme International purchased the Perry Ellis brand from Salant, a licensee of Perry Ellis that acquired it from Manhattan Industries in 1986. Supreme renamed itself Perry Ellis International and the company became traded on the NASDAQ under PERY. Perry Ellis International also owns and licenses other notable fashion brands, such as Original Penguin by Munsingwear, Cubavera, C&C California, Rafaella, Laundry by Shelli Segal, Ben Hogan, Jantzen, Nike Swim and Callaway, among others.\n\nMoving into the twenty-first century, the Perry Ellis name has continued to expand. Building upon styles set forth by Ellis, the brand has successfully continued to grow, collaborate with other designers, such as Duckie Brown, and hold critical acclaim.\n\n\n\n"}

He established the soil mechanics course at Imperial College London, where the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department's building was renamed after him in 2004, and was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to engineering. He was also a notable contributor on the history of British civil engineering.\n\nSkempton was born in Northampton and attended Northampton grammar school. In 1932 Skempton he went to the City and Guilds College in London to study civil engineering. After beginning work on a Goldsmiths' Company bursary-funded PhD, he joined the Building Research Station (BRS) in 1936, initially working on reinforced concrete before moving to soil mechanics in 1937.\n\nThe failure of an earth embankment for a reservoir at Chingford in north-east London helped highlight Skempton's insights on clay strata. Other projects included Waterloo Bridge, the Muirhead dam near Largs in Scotland, Gosport Dockyard and the Eau Brink Cut channel of the River Great Ouse near King's Lynn.\n\nIn 1945, Skempton was seconded from BRS to establish a soil mechanics course at Imperial College (recruiting Alan W. Bishop as his first member of staff), becoming a full-time lecturer there in 1946, and introducing, in 1950, the first postgraduate course in soil mechanics. In 1955, he was elevated to the chair of soil mechanics, and from 1957 to 1976 was head of department and professor of civil engineering.\n\nHe made great contributions in the field of quaternary geology and was widely consulted on problems involving landslips, foundations, retaining walls and embankments. Notable projects included the Mangla Dam in Pakistan and the Carsington Dam failure in Derbyshire in 1984.\n\nSkempton worked on many high-profile projects through his life, notably the back analysis of the Chingford reservoir failure (July 1937) and other embankment dams, including that at Chew Valley Lake, for which he designed an array of sand-drains to accelerate consolidation of the weak alluvial foundations, the first such in the UK.\n\nIn situ behaviour of natural clays was of great interest to Skempton, who wrote two papers published by the Geological Society on the geological compaction of natural clays. Among other academic writings, he formulated concepts such as that of A and B pore water pressure coefficient which is still widely used today. Many of his research documents and other writing are available in the Skempton and Bishop Archives at Imperial College.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Institution of Civil Engineers' Soil Mechanics and Foundations committee (now the British Geotechnical Association).\n\nSkempton was also an influential contributor to the history of civil engineering. He chaired the civil engineers archive panel at ICE where he edited works on William Jessop (1979), John Smeaton (1981), regarded as the founder of civil engineering, and early fen drainage engineer John Grundy, and started work on the first volume of \"A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers of the British Isles\", eventually published in 2002.\n\nSkempton was a member of the Links Club of the City and Guilds College whilst at Imperial College. He delivered the 4th Rankine Lecture titled \"Long-term stability of clay slopes\" in 1964. In recognition of his soil mechanics contributions, in 2004, the department of Civil & Environmental Engineering building at Imperial College was renamed after him: the Skempton Building.\n\nOther accolades included Fellow of the Royal Society (1961) and Founding Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. Skempton also accumulated medals from the ICE (the 1968 James Alfred Ewing Medal), the Geological Society (the 1972 Lyell Medal), Newcomen Society, and a gold medal from the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE). He was knighted for services to engineering in the 2000 New Year Honours.\n\nSkempton was elected as the second President of the International Society of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, following Terzaghi, in 1957. He also won the Terzaghi award from the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\n\n\"A Particle of Clay: the Biography of Alec Skempton\". \n"}

Since its founding in 1976 by Bill Kramer, Henry Posner, and David Tenney, Kramer's has become a local institution and meeting place for neighborhood residents, authors, and politicians. It was one of the first bookstores in the country to feature a cafe which influenced similar business models nationwide. Notable people that have visited Kramer's include Barack Obama, Andy Warhol, Maya Angelou, and Monica Lewinsky, whose purchases at the bookstore attracted national attention during the Lewinsky scandal investigation and led to a high-profile legal battle. Kramer's was sold in 2016 to Steve Salis.\n\nKramerbooks, located at 1517 Connecticut Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood, opened in August 1976 by Bill Kramer, David Tenney, and Henry Posner. Two months later, the business partners opened Afterwords Cafe, with an entrance on 19th Street, in the same building. Constructed in 1920, the building was originally an automobile showroom. Later tenants included Hudson Air Conditioning Corporation and the women's clothing stores Looby and Peck & Peck.\n\nThe bookstore was one of four in Washington, D.C. managed by Kramer, who had taken over the business from his parents, Sidney and Miriam Z. Kramer, librarians who opened their first store, Sidney Kramer Books, in 1946. Kramer wanted to open a business that provided customers a place to eat and read, what he described as \"two of the three most enjoyable human activities.\" At the time of its opening, there were few places in the country that provided such a service. The concept became popular and other businesses, including the Harvard Book Store and Square Books, followed Kramerbooks & Afterwords' lead and opened their own cafes.\n\nIn its early history, Kramer's was open 24 hours and soon became a popular destination for neighborhood residents, authors, and politicians. It also earned a reputation as a place to meet a potential date. \"The New York Times\" described Kramer's as \"one part bookstore, one part restaurant and perhaps one part singles bar.\" According to Posner, Kramer's in part \"helped establish a street life in Dupont Circle.\" For many patrons, it was the first place where they had their \"first real espresso and cappuccino, their first microbrews, their first taste of Häagen-Dazs, their first decent bagels.\" The owners would have fresh bagels from New York delivered to Washington, D.C.'s Greyhound station because they couldn't find any decent ones in the area.\n\nIn 1984, Afterwords Cafe expanded by offering sidewalk seating on 19th Street. The business expanded again in 1991 when the adjoining building occupied by Cafe Splendide, 1521 Connecticut Avenue, was purchased. The expanded section included an enlarged bar. In 1993, the first of two branches opened in Arlington, Virginia. The store was three times the size of the Connecticut Avenue location and also included a restaurant. Both of the Arlington branches were unsuccessful and soon closed.\n\nKramer's came to national attention in 1998 during the Lewinsky scandal, when it successfully fought a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to disclose which books Monica Lewinsky had purchased. When the subpoena was first issued, it was reported Kramer's management would comply, although Kramer said that was not the case. The store was picketed by librarians, customers were upset, and sales dropped. Management chose to fight the subpoena with the help of several organizations, including the American Booksellers Association (ABA), American Library Association, and American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn an interview, Kramer defended his actions citing the First Amendment and said \"They are looking for us to hand over information about a specific customer's specific purchases, and that we will not do.\" After U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ordered Kramer's management to hand over the information to Starr, they declined and said they were ready to take the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. Kramer's management and Lewinsky's lawyers reached an agreement whereby the list of books she purchased would be given to Starr by her lawyers and not the bookstore, thereby protecting the store's integrity. The store's six-figure legal bills were paid in part by the ABA.\n\nDespite the decline in the independent bookstore industry, Kramer's has continued to draw in customers looking for an intimate setting, live music, author events, and full bar. Kramer's is often called a Washington, D.C. institution and has been described as \"iconic\" and a \"staple of the District's cultural scene.\" Notable people that have visited Kramer's include President Barack Obama and his daughters who shopped at the store in 2011 on Small Business Saturday. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and John Slattery filmed a scene from the television series \"Veep\" in Kramer's. Other celebrities that have visited include Maya Angelou, Andy Warhol, Toni Morrison, and Margaret Cho.\n\nThe shuttering of large chain bookstores, most notably the nearby Books-A-Million, proved to be a benefit to Kramer's although the increased number of trendy restaurants in the city affected the cafe's business. The cafe and bookstore bring in around the same amount of revenue, whereas before the cafe brought in more money. In 2015, the combined sales for the restaurant and cafe was $10 million. That same year Kramer and Tenney began plans to sell the business. Tenney said \"I knew the business was viable, but I also knew the restaurant was beat up and tired. If we could find some way to resurrect and invigorate the restaurant, there would be a wonderful future ahead.\" They were introduced to &pizza co-founder Steve Salis and in 2016 it was announced Salis would purchase Kramer's with Tenney remaining as part-owner. Salis oversaw an expansion and renovation of the business that included purchasing the adjoining building previously occupied by Willie T’s Lobster Shack. With the additional of retail space, the bookstore and cafe measure . In 2017, several longtime employees, including the general manager, events manager, and head buyer, quit after disagreements with Salis and opened a new bookstore on H Street NE later that year.\n\n"}

After the \"Clampherdown\"s guns fail to sink the cruiser, and she drifts aimlessly being shelled, she collides with the cruiser, and her crew \"out cutlasses, and board!\" the enemy.\n\nIt was inspired by a letter written to the \"St James's Gazette\", whose author \"seemed to believe that naval warfare of the future would be conducted on the old Nelsonic battle lines, including boarding, etc.\", to quote Kipling's explanation. He wrote the poem as a deliberate humorous play on this idea; however, to his surprise, it was taken quite seriously and published. Whilst boarding did never return as a major part of naval warfare, it did occur occasionally. The last major boarding action by the Royal Navy was the \"Altmark\" incident, in 1940, complete with cutlass-wielding Royal Marines.\n\nThe \"Clampherdown\" is described in some detail in the poem, allowing some comparison to be made to real vessels. Whilst the name is similar to HMS \"Camperdown\", the physical description—\"one bow-gun of a hundred ton / and a great stern-gun beside\"—is closer to that of her sister ship the \"Benbow\", which was built with an experimental armament. Both were Admiral class battleships, pre-dreadnoughts launched in the 1880s. The 16.25″ guns of \"Benbow\", the largest and most powerful then fitted to a Royal Navy battleship, were not greatly successful in service; they took four or five minutes to load and fire, the barrels only had a life of 75 rounds, and the muzzles tended to droop. The ships of this class were only partially armoured, with the bow and stern being lightly protected, and had low freeboard; these factors are noted and reflected in the text. In 1892, \"Benbow\" had recently been removed from active service and was serving as a guard ship at Greenock; the defects in her design would have been clear by this point.\n"}

She is a founding member of the International Thriller Writers.\n\nHillhouse is also a health care executive who has developed behavioral health programs for children with autism. She was CEO and President of Hawaii Behavioral Health. She also founded Thrive Autism Solutions, one of the largest providers of autism behavioral health services in the Midwest.\n\nHillhouse studied in Central and Eastern Europe for over six years at various institutions including Moscow State University, Moscow Finance Institute, Humboldt University of Berlin, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen (both in Germany), and Babes-Bolyai University (Cluj, Romania). She earned her undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis and her MA in Russian and East European Studies as well as her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan.\n\nWhen living as a student in Europe, she claims to have engaged in the black market between East and West, running Cuban rum, smuggling jewels from the Soviet Union and laundering East Bloc currencies. She claims to have been recruited by the East German secret police, the Stasi, and by the Libyan Intelligence Service. Some sources assert that she was an American intelligence officer, but Hillhouse denies this.\n\nHillhouse was born in the Ozarks and currently lives in Hawaii.\n\nHillhouse writes a national security blog which has broken multiple national security stories. Her work has been extensively cited in global media, books and academic journals and law reviews. In 2007 the \"New York Times\" Week in Review republished excerpts from an exclusive interview from Hillhouse's blog with the head of the private military corporation Blackwater USA. In June 2007, Hillhouse discovered the US national Intelligence Community budget metadata in a declassified PowerPoint presentation released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Hillhouse broke international news stories on national security risks caused by the explosion in outsourcing governmental intelligence functions. Hillhouse's controversial articles have twice elicited a response from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence—the only times the office of the nation's chief spy has ever publicly responded to the writings of a private citizen. Her most controversial work involved an account of the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nOn August 7, 2011 Hillhouse published an account of Osama bin Laden's death on her blog that suggested Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had been sheltering bin Laden in return for Saudi cash and that he was betrayed by a Pakistani intelligence officer. Hillhouse's sources claimed that the narrative given by the White House of the courier revealing the location of bin Laden was a cover story, created to hide involvement of US allies in sheltering bin Laden. According to \"The Telegraph\", Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance on their way to and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid. Hillhouse's 2011 story received widespread international attention and was picked up by the Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail, the National Post, The Vancouver Sun, The Sydney Morning Herald, The New Zealand Herald and others, but had little coverage in the US.\n\nIn May 2015, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report in the \"London Review of Books\" in which he claimed to break the story of bin Laden's death. His claims mirrored the one's Hillhouse had raised four years earlier. The \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\" and other global media acknowledged that Hillhouse wrote about the events years before Hersh, although Hersh denied ever having seen Hillhouse's account.\n\nMedia suggested that Hillhouse and Hersh's stories appeared to be based on different sources and The Intercept concluded that they might corroborate each other if the identities of the sources were known. After the Hersh story broke, major news outlets confirmed portions of Hillhouse's original story. NBC News also independently reported that a Pakistani intelligence officer was the source of the original bin Laden location report, and not the courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse both reported that their sources indicated that a walk-in was a highly valuable asset in the discovery of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the \"News International\" reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family.\n\nShe has also published stories on national security in the \"Washington Post\" and \"The Nation\". In the controversial Washington Post article, Hillhouse wrote that \"the private spy industry has succeeded where no foreign government has: It has penetrated the CIA and is running the show.\" In the Nation article, Hillhouse revealed that private companies are heavily involved in the nation’s most important and most sensitive national security document — the President’s Daily Brief. Hillhouse was also a regular contributor to Wired's national security blog, The Danger Room.\n\n\nHillhouse's debut novel, \"Rift Zone\" (2004), is a spy thriller about a female smuggler who becomes entangled in an East German plot to stop the fall of the Berlin Wall. The American Booksellers Association Book Sense program selected it as one of the best books of 2004 and Library Journal named it one of the year's most promising debuts. Her second novel, \"Outsourced\" (2007) is a political thriller about the outsourcing of the CIA and Pentagon and the turf wars between the two agencies.

It is situated 1 mile northwest of the modern town of Norma, on the western edge of the Volscian Mountains or Monti Lepini. The town is perched above a precipitous cliff with a splendid view over the Pomptine Marshes below; the highest point stands to ca. 460 meters (over 1500 feet) above sea level.\nNorba was a member of the Latin League of 499 BC. It became a Roman colony in 492 BC, initially to protect the border with the Volsci, and later serving as an important fortress guarding the Pomptine Marshes. It served in 199 BC as a place of detention for the Carthaginian hostages, and was captured and destroyed by Sulla's troops during the civil wars at the end of 82 BC. By the first century AD Norba is included by Pliny the Elder on his list of extinct cities in Latium.\nFrom excavations begun in 1901 it seems clear that the remains now visible on the site are entirely Roman. The well-preserved walls are in the polygonal style, over 2.5 km in circuit, and are entirely embankment walls, not standing free above the internal ground level. The walls enclose an area of approximately 38 hectares. Remains of two towers, and of several gateways (notably the Porta Maggiore, defended by a tower), exist. The bastion at the Porta Maggiore still stands to 13 m. A square tower, referred to as \"La Loggia\" is also to be found along the curtain. The main gate is enormous, with jambs over 8 m in height, 4.30 m in width, and internal width of 12.8 m. Within, the remains of several, buildings, including the foundations (podia) of two temples, one dedicated to Juno Lucina, have been examined. At the foot of the cliff are the picturesque ruins of the medieval town of Ninfa, (12th-13th centuries) abandoned on account of malaria. The remains of a primitive settlement, on the other hand, have been discovered on the mountainside to the southeast, above the 13th-century abbey of Valvisciolo, where there is a succession of terraces supported by walls of rough polygonal masonry, and approached by a road similarly supported. Here a quantity of primitive pottery has been found. The necropolis of this settlement was probably the extensive one situated at Caracupa (8th-7th century BC), near the railway station of Sermoneta, which belongs also to the 8th-6th century BC, terminating thus at the precise date at which the Roman city of Norba is believed to have been established.\n\nAdditional ancient remains are to be found in the hinterland of Norba, including the polygonal masonry structure at Poggio Serrone di Bove.\n\n"}

It tells the story of Zadig, a philosopher in ancient Babylonia. The author does not attempt any historical accuracy, and some of the problems Zadig faces are thinly disguised references to social and political problems of Voltaire's own day.\n\nIt was originally published as \"Memnon\" in Amsterdam (with a false imprint of London given) and first issued under its more familiar title in 1748.\n\nThe book makes use of the Persian tale \"The Three Princes of Serendip\". It is philosophical in nature, and presents human life as in the hands of a destiny beyond human control. Voltaire challenges religious and metaphysical orthodoxy with his presentation of the moral revolution taking place in Zadig himself. \"Zadig\" is one of Voltaire's most celebrated works after \"Candide\". Many literary critics have praised Voltaire's use of contradiction and juxtaposition.\n\n\nZadig, a good-hearted, handsome young man from Babylonia, is in love with Sémire and they are to marry. Sémire, however, has another suitor: Orcan, who wants her for himself. Zadig tries to defend his love from Orcan's threat, but his eye is injured in the process. Sémire abhors this injury, causing her to depart with his enemy. Shortly after, Zadig makes a full recovery and falls into the arms of another woman, Azora, with whom he is married, but who promptly betrays him.\n\nDisillusioned with women, Zadig turns to science, but his knowledge lands him in prison, the first of several injustices to befall him. Indeed, the \"\" derives its pace and rhythm from the protagonist's ever-changing fortunes which see him rise to great heights and fall to great lows. Upon his release from prison, Zadig rises in favour with the king and queen of Babylonia and is eventually appointed prime minister; in this role, he proves himself to be a very honest man, looked upon favourably by the king, as he passes fair judgements on his citizens unlike the other ministers who base their judgements on the people's wealth. He is forced to flee the kingdom, though, when his relationship with King Moabdar is compromised: Zadig's reciprocated love for queen Astarté is discovered and he worries that the king's desire for revenge might drive him to kill the queen.\n\nHaving reached Egypt, Zadig kills an Egyptian man while valiantly saving a woman from his attack on her. Under the law of the land, this crime means that he must become a slave. His new master, Sétoc, is soon impressed by Zadig's wisdom and they become friends. In one incident, Zadig manages to reverse an ancient custom of certain tribes in which women felt obliged to burn themselves alive with their husbands on the death of the latter. After attempting to resolve other religious disputes, Zadig enrages local clerics who attempt to have him killed. Fortunately for him, though, a woman that he saved (Almona) from being burned intervenes so that he avoids death. Almona marries Sétoc, who in turn gives Zadig his freedom and then he begins his journey back to Babylonia in order to discover what has become of Astarté. (In some versions there is a further episode in which he visits Serendib and advises the king on the choice of a treasurer and a wife.)\n\nEn route, he is taken captive by a group of Arabs, from whom he learns that king Moabdar has been killed, but he does not learn anything of what has become of Astarté. Arbogad, the leader of the group of Arabs, sets him free and he heads for Babylonia once more, equipped with the knowledge that a rebellion has taken place to oust the king. On this journey he meets an unhappy fisherman who is about to commit suicide as he has no money, but Zadig gives him some money to ease his woes, telling us that source of his own unhappiness is in his heart, whereas the fisherman's are only financial concerns. Zadig prevents him from committing suicide and he continues on his way.\n\nZadig then stumbles upon a meadow in which women are searching for a basilisk for their lord who is ill, ordered by his doctor to find one of these rare animals to cure his sickness. The lord has promised to marry the woman who finds the basilisk. While there, Zadig sees a woman writing \"ZADIG\" in the ground, and he identifies her as Astarté. His former lover recounts what happened to her since Zadig fled Babylonia: she lived inside a statue when he left, but one day, she spoke while her husband was praying before the statue. The king's country was invaded and both Astarté and his new wife, Missouf, were taken prisoners by the same group. The king's wife agrees to formulate a plan along with Astarté to help her escape so that she would not have a rival for the king. Astarté ends up with Arbogad, the very same robber that Zadig encountered, who then sold her to Lord Ogul, her current master. In order to secure Astarté's release from Ogul, Zadig pretends to be a physician. He offers Lord Ogul to bring him a basilisk if he grants Astarté her freedom; instead of providing the basilisk, the lord is tricked into taking some exercise, which is what he really needs to cure him from his illness.\n\nAstarté returns to Babylonia where she is pronounced queen before a competition begins to find her a new king. Zadig is secretly given white armor and a fine horse to compete with by Astarté. Zadig in his white armor triumphs in the contest which takes place between four anonymous knights, but one of the losing competitors, the lord Itobad, steals Zadig's armour and replaces it with his own before the winner is revealed, and dressed in Zadig's armor falsely claims victory. Zadig is forced to wear Itobad's armor and is recognized as the losing knight by the people. Zadig is ridiculed and bemoans his fate, thinking that he will never be happy.\n\nWhile wandering on the banks of the Euphrates, Zadig encounters a hermit reading \"the book of destinies\". Zadig makes a vow to accompany the hermit for the next few days on the condition that he won't abandon the hermit no matter what he does. The hermit claims that he will teach Zadig lessons in life; in one such incident, the pair go to an opulent castle and are treated generously. The lord of the castle gives each of them a gold piece before sending them off. After leaving, Zadig finds that the hermit has stolen the gold basin that the lord allowed them to wash in. Afterwards, they visit the house of a miser and are treated somewhat rudely by the servant and are pushed to leave, but the hermit gives the servant the two gold pieces from the lord and gives the miser the gold basin he stole. The aim, he tells Zadig, is that the hospitable man at the castle will learn not to be as ostentatious and vain, and the miser will learn how to treat guests. They then arrive at the simple home of a retired philosopher who welcomed the travelers in. The philosopher talks of the fight for the crown in Babylonia, revealing that he wished Zadig had fought for the crown not knowing that Zadig is one of his two guests. In the morning, at dawn, the hermit wakes Zadig to leave. To Zadig's horror, the hermit sets fire to the philosopher's home.\n\nIn the last encounter, Zadig and the hermit stay with a widow and her young nephew. After their stay the boy accompanies the travelers to the bridge by the widow's orders. At the bridge, the hermit asks the boy to come to him. He then throws the fourteen-year-old into the river drowning him, as he claims that Providence tells that he would have killed his aunt within a year, and Zadig within two. The hermit then reveals his true identity as the angel Jesrad, and opines that Zadig, out of all men, deserves to be best informed about Fate. Jesrad states that wickedness is necessary to maintain the order of the world and to ensure that good survives. Nothing happens by chance, according to the angel: Zadig happened upon the fisherman to save his life, for example. Zadig should be submissive to Fate, he continues, and should return to Babylonia, advice which he follows. (Surprisingly, regarding Voltaire's hostility towards religions, this passage is based on one of the suras of the Quran (Sura 18 (Al-Kahf), v. 65–82), when Moses follows a mysterious character, endowed with great knowledge, through his journey.)\n\nOn his return, the final part of the challenge to be king is taking place: the Enigmas. Zadig solves the Enigmas with consummate ease and proves that it was he that won the first contest by challenging Itobad once again to a duel. Zadig offers to fight wearing only his robes and armed with a sword against Itobad clad in the stolen white armor. Itobad accepts this challenge. Zadig manages to defeat Itobad, and takes back the stolen armor. Zadig marries Astarté, is crowned king, and rules over a prosperous kingdom.\n\nThe detective work portrayed in \"Zadig\" was influential. Marquis de Sade refers directly to Voltaire's work in the first pages of \"Justine ou les Malheurs de la vertu\", 1791. Georges Cuvier wrote, in 1834, in the context of the new science of paleontology:\n\nT. H. Huxley, the proponent of Darwin's theories of evolution, also found Zadig's approach instructive, and wrote in his 1880 article \"On the Method of \"Zadig\"\":\nEdgar Allan Poe may have been inspired by \"Zadig\" when he created C. Auguste Dupin in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", which Poe called a \"tale of ratiocination\" and which established the modern detective fiction genre. Émile Gaboriau and Arthur Conan Doyle were perhaps also influenced by \"Zadig\". As Barzun and Taylor put it in \"A Catalogue of Crime\": \"However implausible and \"agrarian\" his method, he is the first systematic detective in modern literature, and that priority itself adds to his troubles in the story until his royal vindication.\"\n\nThe text also influenced the Icelandic romance-saga \"Fimmbræðra saga\", whose author, Jón Oddsson Hjaltalín, also adapted \"Zadig\" itself into Icelandic.\n\n"}

In the 1980s, it was renovated and adapted for use as office space, with the exterior restored and preserved. This project received awards from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the American Institute of Architects.\n\nThe meeting house is a site on the National Park Service's Black Heritage Trail and is part of the Beacon Hill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe church was built between 1804 and 1807 to the designs by noted American architect Asher Benjamin for the Third Baptist Church, which used the nearby Charles River for its baptisms. In the years before the American Civil War, it was a stronghold of the anti-slavery movement, and was the site of notable speeches from such anti-slavery activists as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth. Pastors of the Third Baptist Church included Caleb Blood (1807-1810), Daniel Sharp (1812-ca.1853) and J.C. Stockbridge (1853-ca.1861). The congregation was eventually \"absorbed by the First Baptist Church.\"\n\nThe Baptist congregation sold the structure to the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1876. The AME congregation was part of the first black independent denomination in the United States, established in Philadelphia in the early 19th century. Pastors included William H. Hunter and J.T. Juniper.\n\nThe AME Church sold the building in 1939 to the Charles Street Meeting House Society. It was briefly used as an Albanian Orthodox church before the Society granted the building in 1947 to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities. This was conditioned on the society conveying the building to the Massachusetts Universalist Convention (Universalist Church of America) and keeping restrictions to preserve the building’s exterior. It served as a Universalist Church of America church from 1949 to 1961, and as Unitarian Universalist after consolidation, from 1961 to 1978/1979. This was a Universalist experimental church.\n\nIn 1979, the building was sold to a private owner. At that time, the Society negotiated a specific preservation easement with the owner.\n\nThe Meeting House is a recognized site on the Boston Black Heritage Trail and located in the Beacon Hill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The nineteenth-century altered sanctuary was relatively intact, but much of the rest of the interior held little architectural significance in comparison with the exterior. The National Park Service permitted extensive vertical and horizontal internal subdivision, provided that the developer incorporate some existing ornamental features.\n\nIn 1980 the Meeting House was purchased by the Charles Street Meeting House Associates. This group intended to restore the exterior and find viable, compatible uses for the interior spaces. Exterior restoration and interior renovation for office, retail, and residential uses commenced in the fall of 1981. Construction and occupancy were completed in the summer of 1982. The meeting house was converted in the early 1980s by the architectural firm of John Sharrat Associates into four floors of offices, with retail on the ground floor. The exterior was completely preserved.\n\nOn May 6, 1983 The National Trust for Historic Preservation presented the Preservation Honor Award to the Charles Street Meeting House for its successful restoration and reuse. On September 22, 1984 The American Institute of Architects presented the Award for Excellence in Architecture to the Charles Street Meeting House for the same project.

{"id": "2302064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2302064", "title": "Zenana", "text": "Zenana\n\nZenana (, , , ) literally meaning \"of the women\" or \"pertaining to women,\" in Persian language contextually refers to the part of a house belonging to a Hindu or Muslim family in the Indian subcontinent which is reserved for the women of the household. The \"zenana\" are the inner apartments of a house in which the women of the family live. The outer apartments for guests and men are called the \"mardana\". Conceptually in those that practise purdah, it is the equivalent in the Indian subcontinent of the harem.\n\nChristian missionaries were able to gain access to these Indian girls and women through the zenana missions; female missionaries who had been trained as doctors and nurses were able to provide them with health care and also evangelise them in their own homes.\n\nPhysically, the zenana of the Mughal court consisted of exceptionally luxurious conditions, particularly for princesses and women associated to high-ranking figures. Because of the extreme restrictions placed on access to the women's quarters, very few reliable accounts of their description are available. Still, modern scholars evaluating court records and travelogues contemporary with the Mughal period detail the women's lodgings as offering courtyards, ponds, fountains and gardens. The palaces themselves were decorated with mirrors, paintings and marble. Jahanara, daughter of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, famously lived in her own apartment decorated with valuable carpets, and murals of flying angels. Other amenities depicted in illustrations of court life include running water and meticulous gardens.\n\nRather than being the prison-like space of licentious activity popularized by European imagination (see Orientalism), the zenana functioned as the domain of female members of the household, ranging from wives to concubines to widows, unmarried sisters and cousins, and even further distant relations who were considered dependent kin. In addition to the women of rank, the zenana was populated by attendants of various skill and purpose to provide for the needs of the ladies residing within. All visiting friends, servants, and entertainers were invariably female, down to the highly trained corps of armed women — guards known as \"urdubegis\" — assigned to escort and protect the women in the zenana.\nAccording to Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, author of the \"Akbarnama\", the zenana of Akbar the Great at Fatehpur Sikri was home to more than five thousand women, who had each been given her own suite of rooms. The size of the zenana meant that it was a community unto itself, and it thus required systematic administration to maintain; all of these administrators were female. Abu'l Fadl describes the zenana as being divided into sections, with \"daroghas\" appointed to tend to the financial and organizational needs of the residents. Other administrative positions included the \"tehwildar\", or accounts officer, responsible for the salaries and financial requests of the inhabitants. Then there were the \"mahaldars\", the female servant of highest authority chosen from within the ranks of the \"daroghas\", who often acted as an intelligence source from the zenana directly to the emperor. The \"anagas\", or royal wetnurses, were elevated to positions of rank, though their purpose was not strictly administrative.\n\nIt was because male members of Mughal society did not closely define the concept of purdah as a reflection of their own honor that wives, daughters, and particularly unmarried women in the upper-echelons of the empire were able to extend their influence beyond the physical structures of the zenana. That less-constrictive interpretation of purdah allowed the ladies of the Mughal court to indirectly participate in public life, most notably in civic building projects. Jahanara herself was responsible for the major alteration of Shahjahanabad, by constructing the now famous Chandni Chowk market. Altogether, wives, daughters, and even a courtesan were the primary patrons to 19 major structures in the city. Owing to the cultural precedent set by their Timurid ancestors, it was comparatively more acceptable for Mughal women to perform civic charity in the form of building projects and even engage in leisure activities outside the zenana like hunting, polo and pilgrimage, than it would have been for their Safavid contemporaries. Nur Jahan seems to be unique in that she had a particular affinity for hunting, and was able to gain permission to accompany her husband Jahangir on several outings, even once killing four tigers easily with her excellent marksmanship.\n\nDespite the social freedom that came with being a member of the royal household, Mughal women did not go about unveiled and were not seen by outsiders or men other than their family. Instead, when they traveled they covered their heads and faces in white veils, and they were transported in howdahs, chaudoles, carriages and palanquins with covering on all sides, to maintain the modesty and seclusion required of purdah. When entering or exiting the zenana itself, female pall bearers carried their palanquins, and they were only transferred to male servants and eunuchs outside the walls of the zenana. Should outsiders be required to enter the zenana, as in the case of an illness where the lady could not be moved for her health, the visitor was covered from head to foot in a shroud and led blindly to the lady by a eunuch escort.\n\n"}
