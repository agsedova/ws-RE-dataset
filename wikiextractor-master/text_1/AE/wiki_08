He also scored a hit for himself: in 1999 he reached number 1 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with \"Baby Wants to Ride\". The track also peaked at No. 70 in the UK Singles Chart in March 2000.\n\nIn 2006, Hani returned to the dance charts under the alias Disconfect, where his collaboration with Andrea Martin on \"The Story Of My Life\" peaked at No. 21 on \"Billboard\" 's Hot Dance Airplay chart the week of May 1, that same year.\n\nIn 1984 Hani back home in Kuwait was a bedroom Dj recording mixed cassette tapes for himself & close friends. By 1988 during his college years in Denver Hani became a professional Dj at several major clubs. Saved enough money to purchase used Synthesizers, Drum Machines & 4 track tape from pawn shops. Hani learned on his own the art of making Electronic Dance Music & was able to release few underground records just to put his name out there. Obviously that was not enough. In 1993 Hani got his start doing underground Acid House tracks for Carl Craig’s Label Planet-e & Deep Dish‘s labelYoshitoshi. Soon after Hani decided to take a dive and go to New York to live and study audio engineering.\n\nBy 1994 Hani was enrolled in the Institute of Audio Research in New York City. There he gained a well needed knowledge of the fundamentals of audio acoustics, electronic circuitry, engineering & mixing. While attending the institute Hani also wasted no time & applied at Bass Hit Studios for an intern job. He chose this particular studio only because it was the closest to his apartment. Soon Hani learned that Bass Hit was a Mecca’ for House music producers & remixers. Call it destiny i guess.\nIt was at Bass Hit Studios that Hani acquired a deeper sense of Electronic Dance Music by working for such House music luminaries as Masters at Work (Little Louie Vega & Kenny Dope), Roger Sanchez and Danny Tenaglia. \nHani cleaned the studio after them, picked up the garbage and delivered food however, he also learned the basics of House arrangements and mixing .\nWhile doing so Hani started his remix career working on projects for Artists such asDeee-Lite, Repercussions & Urban Soul. The competition in New York city was very high & Hani had to quickly make a name for himself therefore, he did not follow the rules. He did not wait for record labels to give him a chance at remixing songs he liked. He chose songs he gravitated to & went on to produce his own remixes in his simple little studio without being commissioned or paid to do it. Hani built a long list of Dj friends who admired his talent & consistently played his work around the globe. His 1995 unauthorized remix of Sade’s “I Never Thought I’d See the Day” under the aliasMusk Men; (one of his many other aliases), got him the exposure he’d been waiting for. “It was bootlegged by several labels in US & Europe and gave Hani a Jump-start. Sadehowever, was not into remixes so never got an official release. Then came Hani’s unauthorized remix of Sting‘s “Sister Moon” which also was bootlegged. Due to its success, this remix got the official approval & got released by A&M.\n\nThe rather shy and always-keeping-a-low-profile Hani when it comes to his music, did not deny the fact that at the beginning of his career he was pushing for worldwide recognition. Hani’s passion for creating music became a steadfast career in the summer of 1996 with the release of his first No:1 Billboard production “Soul To Bare” with house diva Joi Cardwell. Moreover, Hani went on to produce another international hit “That Look” by Delacy . Both where featured by Pete Tong on BBC / Radio 1.\nHani kept on working & releasing several official remixes for various independent dance labels until in 1996 Hani decide to work on an unauthorized remix of Michael Jackson’s- “Earth Song”. Epic / Sony Was not planning on releasing the song as a single off MJ’s History album until dj Frankie Knuckles persistently kept on playing Hani’s remix on both radio & in clubs . One unforgettable afternoon Hani recalls ” I got contact by a big Sony executive to inform me of how much MJ & the label loves the remix & how excited they are to release it worldwide. “Earth Song” went on to become No:1 at new entry for six weeks on the UK pop chart . 3 months later Hani got commissioned to remix MJ’s “Stranger in Moscow” .\nOne of the great rewards of Hani’s new found ‘name-to-look-out-for’ status was an invitation to collaborate with the Godfather of House Frankie Knuckles on a remix project. “He’s one person who really impressed me, because there’s a certain sound in what he does that I think is really really interesting. I like the touch that he\nhas“, Frankie acknowledges.\n1997 saw the birth of hit remixes like Jay Z’s “Can’t Knock The Hustle” & the famous unauthorized mix of “Rocket Man” by Elton John.\nRemix & Production offers from major artists & labels started poring down from all directions, Hani was a very busy man working from his own basement studio. His remixes for Amber “One More Night” & Deborah Cox “I Never Knew” where major radio hits on heavy rotation across the US. True to Hani’s style, Arista records had no plans for Deborah‘s song until Hani decided on his own to transform the slow balled/album filler track into a major dance hit. Hani’s humble nature and perfectionist tendencies have allowed his songs to speak for themselves and they continue to be met with great success however, Hani felt that his work was drifting away from the club play arena & stepping more into the commercial radio world. In 1999 Hani decided to remind his early fans of his love for underground club music by producing the hit “Baby Wants To Ride” which went on to become Number 1 on the Billboard Club chart knocking Madonna off the top spot. Once again Hani is on top of the world as his tracks are international hits in several major markets & on various compilations. Soon Hani learned at first hand all about the technical aspects of the music business like publishing, copyright ownership & licensing.\n\nHani’s steady attention and effort toward his remix projects had earned him a fantastic reputation among the dance music ranks and that year witnessed the creation of such hits as “Drugs Are Bad” Hani vs. South Park, “Share the Love” by Andrea Martin and the remarkable “Tuva Groove” by Ondar was an Essential tune on Pete Tongs Show.\n\nBy the year 2000 success of remixes such as “There You Go” by Pink & “Glorious“Andreas Johnson cemented hani’s position as one of the top remixers in the US. Although he is increasingly well known by record labels with each project, Hani insists upon transforming tracks on his own initiative. His 2002 Beatles remix of “Eleanor Rigby” was so well done that Hani was complimented by Capitol Records executives personally, and was such an innovative idea that it was quick to be copied.\n\nBy 2003 Hani became one of the top electronic music producers & well known remixer to the stars. He went on to officially remix some of today’s top international artists . His phenomenal work on “Diary” by Alicia Keys earned him major respect from his peers & soared to the top of the dance charts. Alicia was not a fan of dance remixes. She turned down many attempts by several renowned remixers until she heard Hani’s work. Then came the famous “Cry Me A River” mix / mash-up for Justin Timberlake. This mix was played every hour on radio stations in New York, Miami & Los Angeles however, it never got an official release due to a sample clearance issue.\nIn 2004 Hani produced his third no:1 Billboard production “Foolish Mind Games” w/ vocalist Jason Walker (a cover of hani’s original work with Faith Trent currently on http://www.soteriosrecords.com\n\nBy 2005 Hani completed and released over 167 remixes! After ten years of producing & remixing for various labels, Hani decided to start his own record label to claim 100% of copyright ownership and publishing. He established Soterios Records in 2006 when downloading music from the Internet caused most major record companies to take a nose-dive in sales. Soterios is the portal to the many colors of Hani’s creative mind. It features his collaborative efforts with singers such as : Kristine W, Andrea Martin, Roland Clark & Virgin Killer. Hani writes, produces & programs almost 100% of his label’s releases under names such as : Jack Shaft, Miles Black Love, Extra Sauce & Ridikulous Kool. Soterios Records is currently on various online platforms including Beatport and iTunes.\n\nCurrently Hani is enjoying a second phase of creative energy and inspiration. “Middle of The Night” w/ Andrea Martin is currently receiving mega spins by deep UK & US djs. His latest Unauthorized mixes for Radiohead, Adele, Sade & Andrea Martin are receiving mega clicks on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/user/NumSound .\n\nWe have only scratched the surface of Hani’s accomplishments & talent. This legendary artist & his collaborations with high-calibers of the music industry worldwide established his name as ‘the one to look for’ when any artist wanted to take a hit song to the next level.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Depending on the country or jurisdiction, election officials may be identified as members of a political party or non-partisan. They are generally volunteers or paid a small stipend for their work. Each polling station is staffed with multiple officials. The duties include signing in registered voters, explaining voting procedure and use of voting equipment, providing ballots, and monitoring the conduct of the election. In US states with Election Day voter registration, they also register unregistered voters on election day. In most other countries, however, voters do not need to register, all citizens being automatically included in the lists of eligible voters. Depending on the jurisdiction, election officials are chosen by a board of elections, county official (such as the county clerk or county auditor), city or township official (such as a city clerk), the federal state, or a national committee. \n\nIn California, poll workers can be any citizen who requests the job at least two months prior to an election. Inspectors and site supervisors receive a minimum of two training classes, and clerks are required to attend a training class within two weeks of the election, with additional certification classes for any machine or technological devices to be used. These classes cover a wide range of topics, including opening and closing of the polls, which color pen to use on which paper, dealing with irate voters, and the rare times when a voter can be challenged.\n\nIn 41 of the 50 United States, high school students can serve as student election judges. Each state has its own set of requirements for students to serve as poll workers, but generally, students must be in good academic standing at their school and meet the particular age or grade conditions.\n\n\n"}

Bowden was previously head coach at Salem University (1983–1985), Samford University (1987–1992), Auburn University (1993–1998), the University of North Alabama (2009–2011), and the University of Akron (2012–2018). He is a son of former Florida State University head football coach Bobby Bowden and a brother of Tommy Bowden, former head football coach at Clemson University, and Jeff Bowden, the former offensive coordinator at Florida State who served as Terry's special teams coordinator at Akron.\n\nBowden attended and played football for West Virginia University, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and graduated \"magna cum laude\" with a degree in accounting. His father, Bobby Bowden, was the Mountaineers' head coach until 1975, and Bowden lettered twice as a running back for his father's successor, Frank Cignetti, Sr. In addition to his post-graduate work at Oxford University in England, Bowden also received his Juris Doctor degree from Florida State University College of Law.\n\nTerry Bowden began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Florida State before becoming the nation's youngest head coach at age 26 when he accepted the position at Salem College in 1983. While at Salem, he won two West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference titles. In 1986, Bowden left to be an assistant coach at The University of Akron for Gerry Faust. In 1987, Bowden became the head coach at Samford University, a school where his father played and coached. At Samford, Bowden directed the program's move from Division III football to Division I-AA scholarship football. In 1991, Bowden's Samford team reached the I-AA semifinals.\n\nIn 1992, Bowden was hired to succeed Pat Dye as the head football coach at Auburn University. Bowden's hiring occurred while the program faced NCAA sanctions, which included scholarship reductions, a one-year television ban, and a two-year postseason ban.\n\nDuring his first year at Auburn in 1993, Bowden led the Tigers to a perfect 11–0 season, becoming the first coach to go undefeated in his debut season at a Division I school. In 1994, Auburn finished 9–1–1, establishing the longest winning streak in school history at 20 games.\n\nIn 1997, Auburn reached the SEC Championship Game, where they held as much as a 20–7 lead, but lost, giving up a fourth quarter 73-yard touchdown pass by Peyton Manning of the Tennessee Volunteers.\n\nIn 1998, Bowden's fate at Auburn changed as he faced criticism for recruiting woes, off-the-field issues that resulted in player discipline, and in his relationships with Auburn administrators, including board of trustees member Bobby Lowder. These issues, combined with a string of player injuries, led to a disastrous start of the 1998 season. After starting with a 1–5 record, Bowden resigned as head coach the night before Auburn played against Louisiana Tech. In conversations with athletic director David Housel, Bowden was given no assurances he would have a chance to remedy the situation for the next season, and that he believed his termination was imminent. The team was coached for the remainder of the season by Bill Oliver. According to a July 25, 2013 article in The Auburn Villager newspaper, a novel titled \"The Legend's Son\" is a thinly disguised satire of Bowden's rise and fall at Auburn.\n\nAfter resigning at Auburn, Bowden accepted a role as a studio analyst and color commentator for ABC Sports' college football coverage where he often referred to his father Bobby Bowden as \"Daddy.\" He was also an exclusive college football columnist for Yahoo! Sports. For a period, Bowden also hosted a sports talk radio show in the Orlando, Florida area. In 2006, Bowden became the expert analyst for Westwood One radio network's College Football National Game of Week. He also co-hosted \"The Coaches Show\" on Sirius Satellite Radio with Jack Arute and worked several times a month as a motivational speaker.\n\nIn a July 30, 2007 column, writing a few weeks before the 2007 college football season, Bowden said he was eager to go back to coaching for the 2008 football season. In December 2007, the coaching job at his alma mater West Virginia opened up: Rich Rodriguez left to be Michigan's coach. Bowden issued a statement which read in part, \"Coming home to West Virginia would obviously be the dream job for me.\" However, West Virginia offered the job to one of Rodriguez's assistants, Bill Stewart, who was the interim head coach when the Mountaineers upset the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl. In late 2007, Bowden interviewed for the head coaching job at Georgia Tech, which ultimately went to Paul Johnson.\n\nBowden returned to the broadcasting booth for the 2008 season. At the end of the year, Bowden took the head coach position at a Division II school, North Alabama.\n\nOn December 31, 2008, it was announced that he would be the next head football coach at the University of North Alabama in Florence. He was officially introduced as the head football coach at the University Center on January 1, 2009. Bowden was tapped to replace Mark Hudspeth, who left after directing the Lions to a 66–21 record and a third berth in seven years in the national playoff semifinals to become the passing game coordinator at Mississippi State University under new head coach Dan Mullen. During Bowden's tenure at North Alabama he guided the Lions to three appearances in the NCAA Division II Playoffs.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, it was announced Bowden would be hired as the next head football coach at the University of Akron, and he was formally introduced on December 28, 2011. He replaced Rob Ianello as the Zips' head coach, who was fired on November 26 after compiling a 2–22 record in two seasons. In his first year, Bowden duplicated Ianello's 1–11 record from 2011.\n\nOn September 14, 2013, Bowden led Akron against Michigan in Ann Arbor and came within a few yards of defeating the Wolverines. The Zips lost, 28–24, after an incomplete pass from the Wolverines' three-yard line on the final play of the game went out of the back of the end zone. Akron led at various points during the game: 10–7 in the third quarter after a 28-yard passing touchdown from Kyle Pohl to Zach D'Orazio; and 24–21 in the fourth quarter after a one-yard pass from Pohl to Tyrell Goodman. Bowden's 2013 team showed improvement, compiling a 5–7 record on the season and snapping the nation's longest road losing streak (28) with a 24–17 victory against the Miami RedHawks. For the signs of improvement shown by the Zips, Akron extended Bowden's contract by two years through 2017. Bowden led the Zips to an 8-5 season in 2015, his first winning season as Akron's coach. He also got Akron their first ever bowl game victory against Utah State in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl.\n\nOn September 15, 2018, Bowden led Akron to the school's first victory over a Big 10 opponent since 1894 (when Akron, then known as Buchtel College, defeated Ohio State 12-6), defeating Northwestern 39-34 on the road. After the Zips finished the season with a 4–8 record, he was fired on December 2, 2018.\n\nIn June 2019, Bowden joined the Clemson Tigers staff as an unpaid intern in addition to attending the university to receive a graduate degree.\n\n"}

{"id": "2330093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330093", "title": "Beach music", "text": "Beach music\n\nBeach music, also known as Carolina beach music, and to a lesser extent, Beach pop, is a regional genre which developed from various rock/R&B/pop music of the 1950s and 1960s. Beach music is most closely associated with the style of swing dance known as the shag, or the Carolina shag, which is also the official state dance of both North Carolina and South Carolina. Recordings with a 4/4 \"blues shuffle\" rhythmic structure and moderate-to-fast tempo are the most popular music for the shag, and the vast majority of the music in this genre fits that description.\n\nThough primarily confined to a small regional fan base, specifically to \"Grand Strand\" communities such as Myrtle Beach, Carolina Beach, and the Golden Isles of Georgia, in its early days what is now known as Carolina beach music was instrumental in bringing about wider acceptance of R&B music among the white population nationwide. Thus it was a contributory factor in both the birth of rock and roll and the later development of soul music as a subgenre of R&B.\n\nWhile the older styles of R&B have faded from popularity nationally, the Carolina shag has gained wide popularity in swing dance circles around the US. This has not generally led to increased appreciation for the music of the beach bands, however. Many of these new shag dance aficionados prefer the \"R&B oldies\" and/or shagging to currently popular tunes that happen to have the required beat. As more networking is being done on the Internet among shag deejays and beach music fans nationwide, however, there is a growing acceptance of the regional bands by the \"new shaggers\".\n\nHistorical accounts of beach music as it relates to the development of this dance are often conflicting, but most agree that the Ocean Drive section of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina is where the beach/shag phenomenon had its greatest impact among vacationing teenagers and college students. The early development started around 1950.\n\nIn the period from roughly the end of World War II through the mid-1950s, many white youth in the still-segregated South could not always hear the compelling music of primarily black popular recording artists in their home towns. At the time, much of these recordings were characterized as \"race music\", a term later replaced by \"R&B.\" In some communities, this remained in effect even after racial integration was implemented in the region. However, young people flocked to the bars and pavilions of the Carolina beaches where the shag was gaining popularity, R&B along with jazz instrumentals by artists such as Earl Bostic ruled the jukeboxes, and the \"beach clubs\" where R&B artists performed live also thrived. Even though toward the end of the 1960s more and more such clubs with similar jukebox selections and live band performances opened in locations other than the beach resorts, the term \"Beach Music\" which began to emerge in the mid-1960s, keyed off of the memorable experiences of dancing the shag to this music at venues by the sea.\n\nA major contributing influence upon this musical affinity beginning in the late 1940s was radio station WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee, which blanketed the Southeast with everything from R&B to blues and more. Stations with similar playlists began to emerge in the Carolinas and surrounding states throughout the late 1950s and the 1960s, increasing the popularity of the music across racial lines and contributing to the increasing popularity of the emerging new gospel-infused R&B sound, soul music.\n\nAmong the most popular and influential R&B artists who produced \"beach records\" in the 1950s and 1960s were the Dominoes, the Drifters, the Clovers, Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, the Tams, the Tymes, the Temptations, the Four Tops, and the Chairmen of the Board. Beginning in the 1960s, certain pop records that had the right tempo to do the shag to also came to be included as a part of the beach music genre. Among the best-known examples are \"More Today Than Yesterday\" by the Spiral Starecase, and \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" by British soul band the Foundations. While some of the \"beach hits\" by these artists appeared on the R&B and rock and roll charts nationally, a great many of them were \"B-sides\"—or even more obscure recordings that never charted at all. With this penchant for obscure R&B, especially from the 1960s, beach music has much in common with the northern soul phenomenon in the UK, and perhaps even more with the popcorn sound in Belgium.\n\nAnother wave of artists, known today as the \"beach bands\" came into prominence in the mid-1960s to early 1970s, heavily influenced by the sound of Motown and the other prominent R&B labels of the day such as Atlantic Records, Stax, etc. These included the nationally-charting groups The Swingin' Medallions, The O'Kaysions, The Tassels, and Bill Deal and the Rhondels. This wave of primarily white R&B artists was part of a strong but nationally short-lived musical trend known as blue-eyed soul.\n\nIn the 1980s, beach music enjoyed a major revival in the Carolinas, thanks largely to the formation of a loose-knit organization known as The Society of Stranders (SOS). Originally intended as a relatively small social gathering of shag enthusiasts, \"beach diggers\" and former lifeguards meeting yearly in the Ocean Drive section of North Myrtle Beach, S.O.S. quickly grew to become a major Spring event.\n\nAt around the same time, a fanzine called \"It Will Stand\" (from the song of that name by The Showmen) began to delve into the history of beach music. Concurrent with the new enthusiasm for the shag, and an increased emphasis on the roots of the music came a period of revival for many of the beach bands that had come to prominence in the 1960s. In addition to these groups, younger artists began to emerge, either as members of established groups, or with groups of their own. Dedicated beach music charts began to appear, tracking the musical tastes of shaggers and other aficionados of the genre. The number of regional radio stations playing beach music began to increase substantially.\n\nIn 1981, Virginia entrepreneur John Aragona sponsored the first Beach Music Awards show at the Convention Center in Myrtle Beach. He would sponsor and produce two more TV Specials over the next several years. In the late 1980s interest in Beach Music was revived and expanded. On November 19, 1988, live from Reynolds Coliseum, on the campus of North Carolina State University, \"The Third Annual Beach Music Awards\" was videotaped by Creative Center, a Los Angeles-based TV production company. The Awards show featured 20 of Beach music's stars and groups, ten Los Angeles based dancers, 20 professional shag dancers, and a twenty-piece back-up band, performing 50 of beach music hits.\n\nThe 3rd Annual Beach Music Awards TV Special was produced by Ron Dunn and Susan B. Donovan. Ron Dunn, DGA, served as director and writer, along with Susan B. Donovan (choreographer), and the show's executive producer, John X. Aragona. One of the key factors was a new song by O.C. Smith, \"Brenda\", written and produced by Charles Wallert. \"Brenda\" was on the national Billboard charts for three months and became the number one beach music song for two years. \"Brenda\" was nominated for six Awards and won five at the Third Annual Beach Music Awards. The telecasts of the Beach Music Awards in the 1990s (the footage appears in TV shows currently being broadcast) brought new awareness to the wide appeal of this music. New songs that were also national hits became popular in the beach music markets. Aragona spent more than 30 years promoting beach music.\n\nThese shows set the stage for the CAMMY Awards show, first held at Salisbury, North Carolina in 1995. The shows soon moved to Charlotte and then to North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where they are still an annual event under their new name, The Carolina Beach Music Awards (CBMA). The CAMMY (CBMA) show has turned into a five-day-long showcase and party for the fans and the bands, with shows all along the strip in NMB. It culminates in a show at the Alabama Theatre. Chuck Jackson and William Bell were the national stars featured in 2009, backed by the Craig Woolard Band and the Band of Oz respectively.\n\nThe best of beach music from the early decades, from both national and regional artists, is known today as \"classic beach\". However, there is more to beach music than just the oldies. New recordings in this style are being produced regularly as part of the regional music industry in the Southeastern United States. While the terms \"beach music\" and \"Carolina beach music\" are still used, the increasing popularity of the shag (and to distance the genre from California-based music often associated with beaches such as yacht rock and surf music) has led to it sometimes being identified as \"shag music\". Many websites have lately begun to refer to this music as \"beach & shag\".\n\nIn a related trend, since the year 2000, there has been a steady increase in the popularity of Southern Soul, led by such R&B labels as Ecko and Malaco. These labels feature both original and new artists of \"the old school\", and sometimes turn out recordings aimed specifically at the beach/shag market. An example of this is \"I'm in a Beach Music Mood\" by Rick Lawson. In addition, at least one dedicated Beach act, General Johnson and the Chairmen of the Board, charted both nationally and internationally with their brand of Southern Soul - sometimes with songs that were not aimed specifically at the beach and shag market, such as \"Three Women\". In 1994. General Johnson released a beach music version of The Ramones' punk anthem \"Rockaway Beach\" as a duet with Joey Ramone as part of the collection \"Godchildren of Soul.\" In its October 15, 2010 edition, the \"New York Times\" obituary for General Johnson referred to \"beach music\" as an \"upbeat brand of rhythm and blues\".\n\nJimmy Buffett cites beach music as a major influence. His CD \"Beach House on the Moon\" was intended as an homage to the genre. Though it featured The Tams, and for a while they toured with him as vocalists, the CD did not yield any tunes that were big hits with beach music fans. However, it may have been influential in popular country music. Since that release, there have been others by artists associated with Buffett that have had that \"perfect shag beat\" and a beach music feel to them. Some have become hits with shaggers, including \"Drift Away\" and \"Follow Me\" by Uncle Kracker, \"Need You Now\" by Lady Antebellum, \"Why Don't We Just Dance\" by Josh Turner, \"Some Beach\" by Blake Shelton and \"When the Sun Goes Down\" by Kenny Chesney. Just as was the case with \"Dancing, Shagging on the Boulevard\" by Alabama in the 1990s, these country-flavored songs went over well on the dance floor regionally but did not please the more R&B oriented beach music fans. They did, however, impact the growing national shag dance scene to some degree.\n\nNational and international pop artists have also contributed to beach music in recent years. Among the most notable are Rod Stewart, Delbert McClinton, Boz Scaggs, Carlos Santana, Kelly Clarkson, Pharrell Williams, Robin Thicke, Bruno Mars, Charlie Puth, and Justin Timberlake, all of whom have had records that performed well on the regional beach music charts.\n\nIn addition to these country and pop connections for the music, the pure R&B aspects of it have led to a kind of cultural cross-fertilization of beach and shag music with the northern soul scene in the UK and elsewhere. This has been due in large part to communication between DJs of the respective genres on the Internet. \"'Fessa John Hook's Endless Summer Network\" has a weekly program featuring noted northern soul deejay Kev Roberts that is streamed online, and there are plans for its programming to also be carried on satellite radio in Europe. \nCarolina beach music was featured on the soundtrack of \"Shag\", a 1989 film starring Bridget Fonda and Phoebe Cates, filmed in part at the Myrtle Beach Pavilion and other Grand Strand locations. Though not a wholly accurate portrayal, with the actresses' uneven attempts at Upstate Carolina accents especially notable, many viewers consider it an agreeable and entertaining \"coming of age\" movie, with a good soundtrack and some excellent shagging. Not widely popular in its initial release, \"Shag\" has become something of a cult film. No doubt it has helped to foster and maintain some interest beyond the Carolinas for beach and shag music.\n\nThe novel \"Beach Music\" by South Carolina author Pat Conroy takes its title from this regional genre of music. The novel's protagonist, Jack McCall, seeks to get his daughter more in touch with her Southern roots. He does this by introducing her to the shag and to classic beach music. He describes The Drifters' song, \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" in this way: \"This is your Mama's and my favorite song. We fell in love dancing to it.\" and \"Carolina beach music,\" her uncle Dupree tells her, \"is the holiest sound on earth.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Eton from 1683 to 1687. From 1687 to 1690 he travelled abroad to Italy, Germany and the Dutch Republic. In 1690 he was Governor of the Merchant Adventurers. He joined the army and was guidon and major in the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards in October 1691 and cornet and major from December 1691 and served as a volunteer in Flanders in 1691 and 1692. He married Jane Leveson-Gower, daughter of Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet, on 8 March 1692. \n\nHyde was returned by his father as Member of Parliament for Launceston on the Granville interest at a by-election on 15 November 1692. He then resigned his army commission. He was returned for Launceston again at the 1695 English general election. He voted against fixing the price of guineas at 22 shillings, and against the attainder of Sir John Fenwick, on 25 November 1696. After his return at the 1698 English general election, he was classed as a Country supporter. In 1700, he was awarded DCL at Oxford University together with his father in a specially called convention. He was returned unopposed at the first general election of 1701, and was blacklisted for opposing preparations for war with France. He was returned unopposed again at the second general election of 1701 and supported the motion of 26 February 1702 which vindicated the Commons’ proceedings in impeaching Whig ministers. At the 1702 English general election he was returned again unopposed. From 1703 to 1710 he was first clerk of writs in Chancery. He was absent from the vote on the Tack in 1704 and was classed as a sneaker. He was returned unopposed as a Tory at the 1705 English general election and voted against the court candidate for speaker on 25 October 1705. He was returned again as a Tory at the 1708 British general election. He told for the Tories in two election disputes and voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. He was returned again for Launceston at the 1710 British general election. In September 1710 he became joint vice-treasurer and paymaster-general for Ireland. He was also appointed to the Privy Council of Great Britain in 1710. However, he succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Rochester on 2 May 1711 and vacated his seat in the House of Commons. He continued to serve the Tory ministry in the House of Lords. \nAs Lord Rochester he received several appointments in 1711. He was Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall to 1714, a Commissioner for building fifty new churches to 1715, Keeper of Richmond New Park to 1727, and High Steward of Oxford University from 1711 for the rest of his life. In 1719 he was one of main subscribers in the Royal Academy of Music (1719), a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage. He succeeded his cousin as 4th Earl of Clarendon on 31 March 1723. \n\nLord Rochester died on 10 December 1753, and was buried at Wootton Bassett. By his wife Henriettta had children:\n\nHis last surviving son Henry Hyde, Lord Cornbury died nine months before him and consequently both earldoms became extinct.\n\n"}

The lot has 18 sound stages from 7,000 to , of office space, and 223 dressing rooms. It is the headquarters of CBS Television Studios but is not open to the public for tours. The triangular site is bisected by the Los Angeles River.\n\nThe company also previously had ownership of two other studios in the area: CBS Television City and Columbia Square.\n\nMack Sennett, a silent film producer and director, came to the San Fernando Valley and opened his new movie studio at this location (at what is now Ventura Boulevard and Radford Avenue) in May 1928. He previously operated a smaller studio on Glendale Boulevard in Echo Park (then called Edendale) where he produced films featuring the Keystone Kops, Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand, Buster Keaton, W.C. Fields, and Fatty Arbuckle.\n\nAfter creating the Studio City lot, Sennett in five years was forced to file bankruptcy and the studio lot was sold off to another film company, Mascot Pictures. Mascot, which specialized in serials, renamed the studio after itself. By 1935, another film company, Monogram Pictures, along with Mascot and Consolidated Film Corporation merged to form Republic Pictures Corporation. The studio lot was renamed Republic Studios. The new studio specialized in B-movies, including many Westerns starring the likes of Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and John Wayne, all of whom got their first breaks with Republic. In the 1950s, Republic leased studio space to Revue Productions, which filmed many early television series on the lot (including early episodes of \"Leave It To Beaver\") before Revue's owner, MCA acquired Universal Pictures and moved Revue's television production to Universal City. Also, Four Star Productions leased the lot for many of its series like \"The Rifleman\", \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater\", and \"The Big Valley\".\n\nRepublic Pictures ceased production in 1958 and Victor M. Carter became its president in 1959. Carter built Republic into a diversified business with foci outside of the television and film business, and so began leasing its lot to CBS. In 1963, CBS Television became the primary lessee of the lot. Almost immediately after leasing the Republic Pictures lot, CBS began to place their network-produced filmed shows there, including \"Gunsmoke\", \"My Three Sons\", and \"Gilligan's Island\". (\"The Wild Wild West\" followed in 1965). The \"Gilligan's Island\" lagoon was located at the northwestern edge of the lot; it was paved over in the mid-1990s to make room for a new parking structure.\n\nWhile under lease, the facility was renamed the CBS Studio Center. The network finally purchased the 70-acre lot outright from Republic in February 1967, for $9.5 million. That same month, Republic also sold off its film library. CBS built new sound stages, office buildings, and technical facilities. To make up for these investments, CBS began to rent out its studio lot for independent producers, and the newly created MTM Enterprises (headed by actress Mary Tyler Moore and her then-husband Grant Tinker) became the Studio Center's primary tenant, beginning in 1970.\n\nMoore's memorable sitcom \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" began filming here in 1970, along with its spinoffs \"Rhoda\", \"Phyllis\", and \"Lou Grant\". In July 1982, CBS formed a partnership with 20th Century Fox to share ownership of the Studio Center, thus once again renaming, this time as CBS/Fox Studios. However, that relationship was short-lived as Fox sold its interest of the Studio Center to MTM, and it became CBS-MTM Studios. In March 1992, the studio once again became CBS Studio Center, when MTM (which was later bought by 20th Century Fox's parent company, News Corporation) sold back its interest in the studio lot to CBS.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1996, \"American Gladiators\" was videotaped at CBS Studio Center. The original \"Gladiator Arena\" (Stage 3) remains preserved in its original form in its original location, with tours and group events available.\n\nToday, the studio is one of the most active in the city for producing sitcoms. It is also the base for \"Semester in L.A.\", a six-week course by Columbia College Chicago.\n\nSince 2007, the Studio Center serves as the home to CBS's Los Angeles flagship TV station KCBS-TV, along with sister station KCAL-TV, as they vacated Columbia Square to move into a newly built, digitally-enhanced office and studio facility located where the house for the CBS reality series \"Big Brother\" once stood. It enables the stations to broadcast their local news in High Definition. The CBS Studio City Broadcast Center also houses the Los Angeles bureau of CBS News, which is shared with the KCBS/KCAL local newsroom; on August 3, 2011, Scott Pelley anchored that evening's edition of the \"CBS Evening News\" from the newsroom.\n\nIn 2008, \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"The Insider\" moved from Paramount lot to the Studio Center, as CBS took over ownership of the series after their de-merger from Viacom.\n\nCBS Studio Center has three backlot areas. The first is the New York Street. During the filming of Seinfeld in the mid-1990s, a New York Street was built to facilitate the filming of exterior shots.\n\nThe second area is the Central Park area. It features an area with grass, trees, paths, and can also be filled with water to create a pond or swamp. \n\nThe third area is the Residential Street. Actually made up of two streets, this area features a number of houses which can be used for a variety of productions. The largest house is currently used on the ABC sitcom American Housewife.\n\n\n"}

In the United States, \"King of Hell\" was published by Tokyopop.\n\nKing of Hell, Takes place in the past in the Land of Korea and its corresponding realms of afterlife, commonly referred to as the next world or hell in the manga . The story primarily revolves around Majeh, the envoy to the next world, and his existence as a servant to the King of \"Hell\".\n\nIn the beginning the King of Hell focuses on Majeh's work as the envoy for spirits to the next world and his various other roles as the servant for the King of Hell. As the storyline develops, we learn of Majeh's past life in which he was a legendary swordsman and martial artist. Because of his past life, Majeh, upon his death, was sent to a special realm in the next world. This realm, known as \"Moorim of the next world,\" is reserved for great warriors who past lives were deemed to be either evil or to be a great threat to other and possibly a threat to the Kingdom of Hell. Upon His arrival to Moorim, Majeh was challenged by over 50 warrior at once and he easily defeated them without any struggle. Because of this incident, Majeh was considered to be one of the most dangerous people in Moorim and was removed by the King and made envoy to the next world.\n\nAware of Majeh's incredible power, the council of the Next World declared that he was too dangerous and placed a seal on him, causing Majeh to revert to his teenage form and suppressing the vast majority of his powers. However, even in his teenage form, Majeh is still an incredible martial artists who has no trouble in defeating most of his opponents as well as any martial artists he may come across in the living world.\nSamhuk, A member of Hell's greatest inspection organization, is observing Majeh's movements as he was ordered to by the King of Hell. Early in the manhwa, Samhuk is caught by Majeh and forced to be his slave or die by his hand! Samhuk, being told of Majeh's power, reluctantly agrees and ends up as a slave and a punching bag for Majeh. It is soon discovered that a rift between the two worlds has opened letting demons crossover and Majeh is ordered to hunt them down.\n\nWhile on his task to rid the world of the newly freed demons, Majeh is ordered to return to Hell where he learn of a new calamity has occurred and Hell's most wicked Demons, those who resided in Moorim, have escaped into the world of Mortals. However, because the escaped fiends are malignant spirits and evil they must find the body of a recently deceased martial artist to fully utilize their lethal martial arts. Majeh is tasked to arrest these formidable enemies to which He refuses.\n\nThe King of Hell, with not other choice, tricks Majeh into going back to his preserved body. Upon his return to the mortal world into his old body, Majeh reverts to his teenage form, due to the sealing spell that was placed on his spirit in the next world. Now back in the mortal world, Majeh has no choice but to complete his task, but is now severely disadvantaged due to his body being that of his teenage years.\n\nShortly after being returned to his body, Majeh meets Chung Poong, a skilled martial arts disciple who is constantly paralyzed with fear in battle, and Dohwa, a female fighter who specialized in the art of poisonous needles.\n\nJust for fun, Majeh decides to accompany them to a martial arts contest which is for fighters under the age of 15. Dohwa, being older, is unable to participate due to the fact that the contest for martial artists over the age of 15 had already finished its registry a day earlier to their arrival. Majeh, his natural state being suppressed to that of a teenage boy, enters the contest with Chung Poong. Also entering the tournament are five martial arts prodigies.\n\nThese martial art prodigies are as follows: Crazy Dog (martial artist, no affiliation), Young (assassin, Mooyoung Moon Sect), Dohak (monk, Sorim sect), Poong Chun (Shaman, Shaman Sect), and Baby( ??, Blood Sect). As the tournament progresses, the Majeh meets and learns about some of the prodigies and somewhat of their backgrounds. Meanwhile, in the backgrounds of the tournament, it seems that there are people undermining the tournament to ultimately cause a rift between the light and dark sects to put into motion a possible war between the two factions. The tournament itself if being held by one of the light sects and one if it seminaries Mo Young, a good man who believes that there are forces that are trying to start a war in the world but is unsure to what end.\n\nAfter two day of the tournament, two of the five prodigies, Poong Chun (defeated by Majeh) and Dohak (Defeated by Crazy Dog), and as well as Chung Poong were eliminated from the tournament. The next fights were Majeh versus Crazy Dog, and Young versus Baby. The fight between Young and Baby resulting in Young resigning stating \"My senses are telling me it would be a mistake fighting you.\" The fight between Majeh and Crazy Dog does not finish as the tournament is interrupted by one of the Moorim demons. Crazy dog is killed by the demon when he attacks him for interfering in his and Majeh's fight.\n\nThe fight that ensues is the hardest that Majeh has had yet in the Manhwa. And it is soon realized the power gap between Majeh (in his current form) and the Moorim Demon. Mo Young attempts to intervene but is quickly out matched. Samhuk leaves and informs the King of Hell of the situation and the king informs Samhuk that hope is not lost, because as Majeh gets closer to the line between life and death, the special seal that limits his power weakens and Majeh is allowed to return to his adult form. The end result is that the Moorim demon is no match for Majeh in his adult form.\n\nAfter the martial arts tournament, the assassin prodigy, Young, tags along with Majeh to find missing martial artists while Dohwa and Chung Poong go on a side mission to find a magical tablet that will help make them stronger. Majeh and Young uncover the crimes and plans of an old group called the Sa Gok, a group thought to have been wiped out, this group plans to rule the world by eliminating both the White and Dark Sects, they were planning new plots to go on with their task. The Sa Gok had turned the missing martial artists into zombies and would use them to start a Great War between the \"good\" and \"evil\" sects in Korea.\n\nMajeh then dragged Young out to Devil Mountain to investigate rumors of a tomb recently found there. This is where the title King of Pa Chun first comes up, a legendary swordsman from 300 years before who rocked the martial arts world. The funny thing is that Majeh happens to know exactly where the King of Pa Chun and his legendary sword was buried and it is not in Devil Mountain. Majeh eventually reveals to all of his fellow treasure hunters, including Chung Poong and Dohwa, that the rumors of a tomb and treasure were an elaborate trap.\n\nMajeh was able to stop the Great War cold then left to continue hunting down the remaining six escaped fiends. The first one he encounters is the old man that interrupts the young dragon tournament. He encounters another fiend while on a side errand for the martial arts leader and helps the monk it was trying to possess destroy the fiend completely. He encounters two more on Raven Ghost Ilse leaving only three (the second one was defeated by the \"heaven sage\" monk at his death) more for him to find. The only problem is that to get enough power to defeat them he has to die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach volume includes new and old faces from the previous volumes. However, many of the characters introduced are never seen in the subsequent later volumes as they are killed off are never mentioned again. Majeh, the main character opts to travel with two specific people beginning in the timeline of volume 3 in which he meets the coward Chung Poong Namgoong and the femme fatale Dohwa Baik. As the manhwa progresses, other characters such as Young, Crazy Dog, Cerberus and occasionally Baby, are often seen accompanying Majeh on his journey.\n\nThere are currently 47 volumes available from Champ Comics in Korea. Before Tokyopop shut down their North American publishing facility, they had published up to 22 volumes of the series. It is currently unknown if the series will be picked up by another English-language publisher.\n\n"}

It is also the second of the two films in the franchise to be given a rating by the MPAA. It was released on DVD and VHS on October 19, 2004.\n\nIn this film, Vakama recalls events that took place long before the classic Bionicle stories at Mata Nui, during which he, along with his friends Nuju, Matau, Onewa, Whenua, and Nokama were chosen to be the new Toa of the island of Metru Nui. To save the city, they must prove themselves worthy Toa, find their mask powers, and protect the \"Heart of Metru Nui\". However, they also find themselves caught up in the schemes of the evil Makuta.\n\nThe film has many scenes taking stock footage from itself. The film was received with mixed reviews, with some noting the filling in of plot holes from the previous film. The series continued to be noted for its visual effects and musical score.

After giving the last stone to Vakama, Lhikan is captured by two Dark Hunters, Nidhiki and Krekka. Vakama later meets the other Matoran at the Great Temple in Ga-Metru; there, they are transformed into six new Toa. After Vakama has a vision, they all set out to recover the six Great Disks hidden throughout Metru Nui, hoping to prove to Turaga Dume, the city's leader, that they are worthy Toa. However, Dume issues that \"small gifts\" will not confirm them as Toa, and puts them to a grueling test instead. When the six fail to pass, Dume denounces them as \"imposters\" and unleashes the Vahki (the city's law enforcers) upon them. In the ensuing chaos, Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua are captured while Vakama and the others escape the Coliseum by leaping into a chute system, with the Dark Hunters giving chase.\n\nVakama, Nokama, and Matau abandon the chute system at Ko-Metru when the Dark Hunters get the flow reversed and set out to find the other Toa and Lhikan, whom Vakama believes is still alive. They hitch a ride on a Vahki transport to Po-Metru, where are ambushed by the Dark Hunters and flee from a herd of Kikanalo beasts. Nokama discovers that her mask allows her to speak and understand foreign languages and persuades the Kikanalo to help them find Lhikan; Matau discovers his mask power (shape-shifting) along the way.\n\nMeanwhile, Onewa, Whenua, and Nuju are trying unsuccessfully to escape when are approached by a mysterious Turaga, who explains that Toa mask powers are needed to escape and teaches them how to activate them. Growing impatient, the Toa argue until Onewa's mind-control and Nuju's telekinesis mask powers activate, and Nuju uses his to create an escape route. Whenua then discovers his mask power (night vision) before the four reunite with Vakama, Nokama, and Matau. The Turaga then reveals himself to be Lhikan, who sacrificed his power to turn Vakama and company into Toa. He inquires as to the safety of the \"Heart of Metru Nui\", which Vakama believed was Lhikan himself, but is actually the Matoran. Vakama then discovers a small canister that contains Dume; the Dume from before was an impostor. Pursued by the Vahki, the Toa, along with Lhikan, set out to stop the false Dume, who has summoned the Matoran to the Coliseum to be placed in canisters to sleep. The false Dume reveals himself to be Makuta in disguise, and plunges the Great Spirit Mata Nui into slumber. The Toa gather as many Matoran capsules as they can and race to escape the crumbling city. On the way out, the Dark Hunters attack them again, but are killed, along with a Nivawk (Makuta's spy), when Makuta absorbs them.\n\nAs the group leaves Metru Nui, Vakama creates the legendary Mask of Time, which he unsuccessfully tried to do as a Matoran, from the Great Disks. Makuta pursues and in the ensuing battle, Lhikan is killed protecting Vakama. In an anguished rage, Vakama knocks the Mask of Time into the sea and defeats Makuta in combat using his newfound concealment mask power. The Toa combine their powers to seal Makuta in a protodermis prison and move on to the surface, emerging on an island they name \"Mata Nui\", in honor of the Great Spirit. There, they sacrifice their Toa power to awaken the Matoran and become Turaga. Vakama gives Lhikan's mask to an injured Matoran named Jaller, to the cheers of the other Matoran and Turaga, and their new lives on Mata Nui begin.\n\n\nPlans were in place before the release of the first \"Bionicle\" movie to create a second movie. The directors Terry Shakespeare and David Molina did have some input into the storyline, though most of the mythology had already been sketched out.\n\nFor the visual style of the film, director David Molina stated “We wanted to give this audience a bigger view of the Bionicle world – more environments, larger vistas.” Also, “The island of Bionicle 2 is something like Manhattan, with lots of commerce and large buildings. The first film was very intimate, very organic. Metru Nui is more mechanical, so it has a different feel.”\n\nTalking about the camera work, director Terry Shakespeare said \"We really concentrated on depth of field with the camera,\" Comparing the two Bionicles, he felt \"The first film had primary colors that were coded to the areas and a younger feel. For BIONICLE 2, we opened it up – the palette had to be more sophisticated, more realistic with earth tones, so we desaturated the characters.\"\n\nMost of the animation was created in Taiwan by a company called CGCG. The process of creating the movie, from storyboarding to delivery of the film took 12 months. Molina additionally added that the pipeline and process for creating this film was faster and more refined than the original Bionicle movie. “Our strength is bringing characters to life and not just robots,” added Shakespeare.\n\nNathan Furst, composer of the first film's soundtrack, returned to score \"Legends of Metru Nui\". In place of the tribal elements used in \"Mask of Light\", Furst integrated electronic and techno sounds into the second film's music to accommodate its futuristic style.\n\nThe \"Legends of Metru Nui\" score was released as a digital album on December 12, 2017, thirteen years after the film's release. Unlike the \"Mask of Light\" and \"Web of Shadows\" soundtracks which contain the complete scores from their respective films, this release contains most of the \"Legends of Metru Nui\" score while omitting music from some scenes. Furst stated that two tracks were excluded on purpose due to their redundancy and because they would have disrupted the \"flow\" of the album, though he has also said that he plans to distribute them.\n\nThis release includes two \"bonus tracks\"; the first is an alternate \"Desert/Kikeinalo\" theme that was unused in the film, while the second is Furst's original sketch for Lhikan's theme which was used partially in the film's DVD menus and incorporated into the score at various moments featuring the character.\n\nThe soundtrack's initial lack of availability was partially due to it being lost in a hard drive crash for several years, as Furst stated multiple times. Prior to the 2017 release, Furst revealed that the \"entire score\" was eventually recovered thanks to his assistant.\n\nCartoon Network's Toonami aired several scenes from the film along with the first Bionicle movie \"\". The film was first screened on October 6, 2004, at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California. Cartoon Network aired the movie for the first time less than two months after its release on December 18, 2004, at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThough reviewers were still skeptical as to the toy promotional nature of these films, several noted their marked improvement over the original Bionicle movie, including its filling-in of major plot holes that had been present in the first film. It was also noted for its references to \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"Star Wars\", \"The Matrix\", and \"Excalibur\". There was concern that the Bionicle brand promoted violence, running counter to the LEGO themes of patience and careful construction. A sequel entitled \"\" was released in 2005.\n\n\"Bionicle 2\" was nominated at the \"DVD Exclusive Awards\" for Best Animated Premiere Movie. It was also nominated for best director and best original score. Bionicle was nominated at the 32nd Annual \"Saturn Awards\" for Best DVD release. It was also an iParenting Media Award winner for Best Home Video/DVD. Two awards were won by the studio that created Bionicle 2 at the 27th Annual \"Telly Awards\". It also won the \"Golden Reel Award\" for Sound Editing in a Direct to Video Release.\n\n\"Bionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui\" was released on DVD on October 6, 2004 in the United States. The DVD included a number of documentaries including the making of the movie and associated toy line. There is also a featurette entitled \"\"The Legend Revealed\"\" that has a brief question and answer session with the production team. Some critics were concerned that the DVD makes too much of an attempt to sell the Bionicle product.\n\n"}

He learned to fly at #1 Elementary Flying School and #4 Service Flying Training School, and flew operationally with 408 Squadron RCAF. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on December 5, 1944, the citation reading,\n\n\"This officer has completed numerous sorties in the role of pilot, involving attacks on most of the enemy's heavily defended \ntargets. On all occasions he has pressed home his attacks with great determination and by his personal example of courage, coolness and confidence has set an example which has inspired all with whom he has flown.\"\n\nOn December 23, 1944, while serving as an instructor with No. 5 Operational Training Unit in Boundary Bay, British Columbia, F/L Clothier was the pilot of a Mitchell bomber that crashed on takeoff. Three on board were killed and Clothier was the only survivor, but he was severely injured with a broken back. He was paralyzed from the waist down for two years. His brother, F/L John George Clothier, was also a pilot in Bomber Command and was killed March 5–6, 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Clothier studied Architecture at the University of British Columbia followed by a stay in England studying theatre. Clothier returned to British Columbia, eventually settling in the Capilano Highlands area of North Vancouver and became well known in the Vancouver area as a stage actor as well as an accomplished sculptor and painter.\n\nIn \"The Beachcombers\" he portrayed Bruno Gerussi's rival beachcomber, Relic – a conniving man of Welsh descent who lived on a house boat and used his jetboat to outrun and challenge Nick's claims to logs.\n\nHe landed the memorable role of Relic, the curmudgeonly, unscrupulous rival of Nick Adonidas in \"The Beachcombers\" and became a household face as it originally aired from 1972 to 1990, one of the longest running Canadian television dramas of all time. Despite Relic's role as Nick's antagonist, his character was well loved by viewers who enjoyed his antics and frequent comeuppance. Relic's actual character-name was Stafford Phillips. Relic was once referred to as \"Taffy,\" a reference to an English nursery rhyme, \"Taffy was a Welshman.\"\n\nClothier had a dispute with CBC over royalties he believed were owed to him for reruns and overseas sales of \"The Beachcombers\".\n\nAfter \"The Beachcombers\" ended its lengthy run, Clothier continued to perform in TV and film productions made in Canada, including two episodes of the American series \"The X-Files\" (which initially was filmed in Vancouver).\n\nIn 1995, the North Shore Arts Commission, of North Vancouver, British Columbia, honoured Clothier with its first FANS award for his contribution to the arts.\n\nIn 1996, Clothier suffered a stroke and was in poor health until his death in 1999. After his stroke, he taught himself to paint with his left hand. He and his wife, Shirley Broderick, had two children, a daughter, Jessica, and a son, John and a granddaughter, Lucy. He was also a Renault fan and had a small collection of Renault 17 Gordini cars at his property in North Vancouver through the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n"}

{"id": "2330138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330138", "title": "Agricultural cooperative", "text": "Agricultural cooperative\n\nAn agricultural cooperative, also known as a farmers' co-op, is a cooperative where farmers pool their resources in certain areas of activity.\nA broad typology of agricultural cooperatives distinguishes between 'agricultural service cooperatives', which provide various services to their individually farming members, and 'agricultural production cooperatives', where production resources (land, machinery) are pooled and members farm jointly. Examples of agricultural production cooperatives include collective farms in former socialist countries, the kibbutzim in Israel, collectively governed community shared agriculture, Longo Mai co-operatives and Nicaraguan production co-operatives.\n\nThe default meaning of 'agricultural cooperative' in English is usually an agricultural 'service' cooperative, which is the numerically dominant form in the world. There are two primary types of agricultural service cooperatives, 'supply cooperative' and 'marketing cooperative'. Supply cooperatives supply their members with inputs for agricultural production, including seeds, fertilizers, fuel, and machinery services. Marketing cooperatives are established by farmers to undertake transportation, packaging, distribution, and marketing of farm products (both crop and livestock). Farmers also widely rely on credit cooperatives as a source of financing for both working capital and investments.\n\nCooperatives as a form of business organization are distinct from the more common investor-owned firms (IOFs). Both are organized as corporations, but IOFs pursue profit maximization objectives, whereas cooperatives strive to maximize the benefits they generate for their members (which usually involves zero-profit operation). Agricultural cooperatives are therefore created in situations where farmers cannot obtain essential services from IOFs (because the provision of these services is judged to be unprofitable by the IOFs), or when IOFs provide the services at disadvantageous terms to the farmers (i.e., the services are available, but the profit-motivated prices are too high for the farmers). The former situations are characterized in economic theory as market failure or missing services motive. The latter drive the creation of cooperatives as a competitive yardstick or as a means of allowing farmers to build countervailing market power to oppose the IOFs. The concept of competitive yardstick implies that farmers, faced with unsatisfactory performance by IOFs, may form a cooperative firm whose purpose is to force the IOFs, through competition, to improve their service to farmers.\n\nA practical motivation for the creation of agricultural cooperatives is related to the ability of farmers to pool production and/or resources. In many situations within agriculture, it is simply too expensive for farmers to manufacture products or undertake a service. Cooperatives provide a method for farmers to join together in an 'association', through which a group of farmers can acquire a better outcome, typically financial, than by going alone. This approach is aligned to the concept of economies of scale and can also be related as a form of economic synergy, where \"two or more agents working together to produce a result not obtainable by any of the agents independently\". While it may seem reasonable to conclude that larger the cooperative the better, this is not necessarily true. Cooperatives exist across a broad membership base, with some cooperatives having fewer than 20 members while others can have over 10,000.\n\nWhile the economic benefits are a strong driver in forming cooperatives, it is not the sole consideration. In fact, it is possible for the economic benefits from a cooperative to be replicated in other organisational forms, such as an IOF. An important strength of a cooperative for the farmer is that they retain the governance of the association, thereby ensuring they have ultimate ownership and control. This ensures that the profit reimbursement (either through the dividend payout or rebate) is shared only amongst the farmer members, rather than shareholders as in an IOF.\n\nIn agriculture, there are broadly three types of cooperatives: a machinery pool, a manufacturing/marketing cooperative, and a credit union.\n\n\nThe first agricultural cooperatives were created in Europe in the seventeenth century in the Military Frontier, where the wives and children of the border guards lived together in organized agricultural cooperatives next to a funfair and a public bath.\n\nThe first civil agricultural cooperatives were created also in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century. They spread later to North America and the other continents. They have become one of the tools of agricultural development in emerging countries.\nFarmers also cooperated to form mutual farm insurance societies.\n\nAlso related are rural credit unions.\nThey were created in the same periods, with the initial purpose of offering farm loans.\nSome became universal banks such as Crédit Agricole or Rabobank.\n\nAgricultural supply cooperatives aggregate purchases, storage, and distribution of farm inputs for their members. By taking advantage of volume discounts and utilizing other economies of scale, supply cooperatives bring down the cost of the inputs that the members purchase from the cooperative compared with direct purchases from commercial suppliers. Supply cooperatives provide inputs required for agricultural production including seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery. Some supply cooperatives operate machinery pools that provide mechanical field services (e.g., plowing, harvesting) to their members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgricultural marketing cooperatives are cooperative businesses owned by farmers, to undertake transformation, packaging, distribution, and marketing of farm products (both crop and livestock.)\n\nNew Zealand has a strong history of agricultural cooperatives, dating back to the late 19th century. The first was the small Otago Peninsula Co-operative Cheese Factory Co. Ltd, started in 1871 at Highcliff on the Otago Peninsula. With active support by the New Zealand government, and small cooperatives being suitable in isolated areas, cooperatives quickly began to dominate the industry. By 1905, dairy cooperatives were the main organisational structure in the industry. In the 1920s–'30s, there were around 500 co-operative dairy companies compared to less than 70 that were privately owned.\n\nHowever, after World War II, with the advent of improved transportation, processing technologies and energy systems, a trend to merge dairy cooperatives occurred. By the late 1990s, there were two major cooperatives: the Waikato-based New Zealand Dairy Group and the Taranaki-based Kiwi Co-operative Dairies. In 2001 these two cooperatives, together with the New Zealand Dairy Board, merged to form Fonterra. This mega-merger was supported by the New Zealand Government as part of broader dairy industry deregulation, which allowed other companies to directly export dairy products. Two smaller cooperatives did not join Fonterra, preferring to remain independent – the Morrinsville-based Tatua Dairy Company and Westland Milk Products on the West Coast of the South Island.\n\nThe other main agricultural co-operatives in New Zealand are in the meat and fertiliser industries. The meat industry, which has struggled at times, has proposed various mergers similar to the creation of Fonterra; however, these have failed to gain the necessary member support.\n\nIn Canada, the most important cooperatives of this kind were the wheat pools. These farmer-owned cooperatives bought and transported grain throughout Western Canada. They replaced the earlier privately and often foreign-owned grain buyers and came to dominate the market in the post-war period. By the 1990s, most had demutualized (privatized), and several mergers occurred. Now all the former wheat pools are part of the Viterra corporation.\n\nFormer wheat pools include:\n\nOther agricultural marketing cooperatives in Canada include:\n\nThe Amazon region of Ecuador is known for producing world-renowned cacao beans. In the Napo region 850 Kichwa families have come together with help from American biologist, Judy Logback, to form an agricultural marketing cooperatives, Kallari Association. This cooperative has helped increase benefits for the families involved as well as to protect and defend their Kichwa culture and the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn India, there are networks of cooperatives at the local, regional, state and national levels that assist in agricultural marketing. The commodities that are mostly handled are food grains, jute, cotton, sugar, milk and nuts\n\nDairy farming based on the Anand Pattern, with a single marketing cooperative, is India's largest self-sustaining industry and its largest rural employment provider. Successful implementation of the Anand model has made India the world's largest milk producer. Here small, marginal farmers with a couple or so heads of milch cattle queue up twice daily to pour milk from their small containers into the village union collection points. The milk after processing at the district unions is then marketed by the state cooperative federation nationally under the Amul brand name, India's largest food brand. With the Anand pattern three-fourth of the price paid by the mainly urban consumers goes into the hands of millions of small dairy farmers, who are the owners of the brand and the cooperative. The cooperative hires professionals for their expertise and skills and uses hi-tech research labs and modern processing plants & transport cold-chains, to ensure quality of their produce and value-add to the milk. \n\nProduction of sugar from Sugarcane mostly takes place at Cooperative Sugar cane mills owned by local Farmers. The Shareholders include all farmers, small and large, supplying sugarcane to the mill. Over the last sixty years, the local sugar mills have played a crucial part in encouraging rural political participation and as a stepping stone for aspiring politicians. This is particularly true in the state of Maharashtra where a large number of politicians belonging to the Congress party or NCP had ties to sugar cooperatives from their respective local areas. Unfortunately, mismanagement and manipulation of the cooperative principles have made a number of these operations inefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are cooperative farms, jointly owned or managed by a cooperative society.\n\n\n"}

He was Yorkshire's first great opening batsman, a lineage continued by Herbert Sutcliffe, Len Hutton and Geoffrey Boycott. He took five wickets in an innings on three occasions with his leg breaks, but except in 1901 (when he claimed 57 wickets) he generally bowled little.\n\nBorn in Driffield, Yorkshire, Brown made his first-class debut for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1889. Here he formed a successful opening partnership with John Tunnicliffe. From 1895 to 1903, he passed 1,000 runs each season, and in 1897 made his highest score of 311, against Sussex at Bramall Lane, following it up with 300 the following year against Derbyshire at Chesterfield. In this match he added 554 for the first wicket with Tunnicliffe, which was then a record partnership for any wicket. He shared 19 century stands with Tunnicliffe in all. He is the only batsman to have scored two triple hundreds for Yorkshire. In 1900, he made 163 to help the Players to a startling two-wicket victory over the Gentlemen, successfully chasing a huge target of 501.\n\nBrown's form in 1894 was such to earn him both a mention as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1895, and a Test debut against Australia at Sydney in 1894/95. He kept his place for all five Test matches, and after England has suffered a crushing innings defeat in the fourth Test (also at Sydney) the teams went into the fifth and final Test at Melbourne with the series level at 2–2. Needing 297 to win, England fell to 28/2, but then Brown and Albert Ward put on 210 before Brown was out for 140, his only Test century. Brown reached his 50 in 28 minutes – still a record – and 100 in 91, then the fastest Test century. England won the game by six wickets and the Ashes 3–2.He was the first batsman in test history to score a test century in the 4th innings of a test match\n\nBrown played only three more Tests, all against the Australians – two in 1896 and one in 1899 – although many judges (not least \"Wisden\") felt that he was unlucky not to be selected for the 1897/98 Ashes tour. He continued to bat productively for Yorkshire for several more seasons, but in 1904 he played just two matches, both in May, against Cambridge University and Leicestershire before a heart condition forced his retirement.\n\nBrown's health continued to worsen, and later that year he died in a medical home in Pimlico, London at the age of 35. Heavy smoking had contributed to asthma and heart problems. The cause of death was given as heart failure and \"congestion of the brain\".\n\nHe is not to be confused with another John Thomas Brown, who played less frequently for Yorkshire over a similar time span. For clarity, subject of this article is often described as \"Brown, J. T. (Driffield)\", the other as \"Brown, J. T. (Darfield)\".\n\n"}

His wife, Belle Morgan, deserted him 10 years earlier, and took their daughters, Janey and Kady, with her when she ran off with another man, Moke Blue. A 17-year old Kady shows up at Jess's place, telling him her mother is running a brothel, and one of the clients got her pregnant with a son, Danny. Danny's father, Wash Gillespie, is the son of the wealthy mine owner who refused to marry her. Kady is money hungry and has returned home to steal silver from the mine. Jess, initially opposed to stealing silver from the mine, relents and says they can take small scraps after she seduces him. They work in the mine together; afterwards, while Kady takes a bath, Jess ends up giving her a massage, but stops short of having sex.\n\nSoon after, Wash arrives in town and proposes to Kady, and she accepts. Suffering from severe tuberculosis, Belle arrives with Blue and a mutual friend, Ed Lamey, ostensibly to celebrate Wash's engagement. Blue insinuates that he knows about the theft, and while the others are out of the house, Belle stabs him with a hat pin. Jess realizes that Ed must have witnessed the theft and told Blue. Jess rushes to the mine, where Blue is frantically pillaging for silver and taunts him. Jess sees a birthmark near his navel that is similar to one on baby Danny, and thinks that Blue is Danny's father. Enraged, Jess shoots him. Before Jess leaves him to die, Blue reveals that Kady is his daughter.\n\nReturning to the Gillespies, Jess lies and tells them that Danny is Blue's son. Wash decides to break off the engagement, but Jess stops him from talking to Kady about it himself. When Wash fails to arrive on the day of the wedding, she despondently resorts to her original plan to steal the silver. She goes to the mine with Jess, where the two have sex while Ed looks on. The police come out with warrants for the arrests of Jess and Kady, and they are charged with incest.\n\nAt a hearing, Judge Rauch calls it \"a crime against nature, shocking and repulsive to every basic sense of propriety, decency, and good citizenship.\" Jess pleads guilty, saying he forced her, so that Kady will not be punished.

It is the only working museum in the Ottawa area and one of the very few operating industrial grist mills in North America. Watson's Mill still sells stone-ground whole wheat flour which is made on site. The mill is also well known for its ghost story. The legend is that Ann Currier, wife of Joseph, haunts the mill, following her death in a tragic accident there in 1861. Watson's Mill is Manotick's most recognized landmark. Its image is used as a symbol for the village.\n\nMoss Kent Dickinson and Joseph Merrill Currier founded the mill as the Long Island Milling Enterprise in 1860. It was one of a series of mills constructed in the area using power from the Rideau Canal. It earned its current name when it was purchased by Harry Watson in 1946. Watson was the last owner to operate the mill at an industrial level. When the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority bought the mill in 1972, it was developed into a museum.\n\nThe mill is open to the public during the summer months and hosts a variety of events, including milling demonstrations every Sunday.\n\nWatson's Mill was originally known as the 'Long Island Milling Enterprise', and was constructed by Thomas Langrell, an Ottawa contractor, for two prominent Ottawa businessmen: Moss Kent Dickinson and Joseph Merrill Currier. Dickinson was a successful forwarder and steamboat owner. He was nicknamed 'King of the Rideau' because of his many freight and passenger steamers that travelled up and down the Canal. Dickinson was also mayor of Ottawa from 1864 to 1866, just prior to Confederation, and lived in what is now the South African Embassy. His partner, Joseph Currier, was a lumber baron, and a partner in the Victoria Foundry located in Ottawa, where all of the Mill machinery was cast. Watson's Mill was originally one of four milling operations built at the same time. A saw mill was completed in 1859, the gristmill in 1860, and a carding mill in 1861. The Canada Bung, Plug and Spile Factory was constructed in 1875, completing the Long Island Milling Enterprise, later to be known as the 'Manotick Mills'.\n\nDickinson intended to develop a village around the Long Island Mills complex. He bought 30 acres of land and sold it as building plots. The village was named 'Manotick', an Algonquin word meaning island. Dickinson also built a house across from Watson's Mill, which still stands today and has been turned into the 'Dickinson House Museum'.\n\nWatson's Mill remained in the Dickinson family until 1928 when Elizabeth, Moss Kent Dickinson's youngest daughter, sold it to Alexander Spratt. Spratt had six children: Charlie, Billie, Helen, Ken, Dick and Hubert. The whole family lived in the Dickinson House while Alexander was running the mill. Alexander died of brain cancer in 1936. His wife continued with the business until it was sold in 1946 to Harry Watson. Watson, his wife Anna and his six children Ron, Bill, Jack, Jim, Bob and Mary all lived in the Dickinson House as well.\n\nWith the introduction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, it became cheaper to import wheat and flour from the West than to grow and mill wheat in Ontario. Spratt and Watson gradually transformed the Mill into a feed and seed operation to keep up with the changing times and to accommodate the local dairy and livestock farmers. Watson also began distributing coal and cement.\n\nWatson's Mill is haunted by the ghost of Ann Crosby Currier, the second wife of Joseph Currier. Born in 1841, Ann was the daughter of a successful hotel owner and grew up along with seven siblings, in the village of Caldwell, New York. In 1861, Ann was married to Joseph Merrill Currier, at that time a co-owner of the Mill.\n\nOn Monday, March 11, 1861, 6 weeks into the marriage, coinciding with the return from Joseph and Ann's honeymoon, Currier and Dickinson held a small party to celebrate their first successful year of operation. While making their way through the congestion of moving equipment and machinery, tragedy struck. Ann's crinoline and dress became caught in one of the turbine shafts on the second floor of the Mill and she was flung against a pillar and killed instantly. Following this tragedy, Joseph immediately lost all interest in the Mill and eventually sold his shares to his partner Dickinson.\n\nSince that time, there have been numerous confirmed sightings of Ann's ghost in Watson's Mill, causing the site to be often considered among Ottawa's haunted buildings. Watson's Mill currently runs a number of events promoting the haunted nature of the building including the Terrifying Tales at Twilight and visits by the Haunted Ottawa and Paranormal Society.\n\nWatson's Mill was built using limestone quarried from the banks of the Rideau River, as well as wood cut locally and milled at the Long Island Sawmill. The mill's interior is highly ornamented; the partners, Dickinson and Currier, wished to make the Mill a model for industrial achievement and business entrepreneurship. Watson's Mill was powered by five turbines constructed in Joseph Currier's foundry. With a sixth turbine that was used to power the Bung Mill across the river. The Ottawa Citizen newspaper described Watson's Mill as \"a castle in the air\" on its opening day.\n\nWatson's Mill continues to run milling demonstrations on Sundays during the summer season. Whole wheat flour milled onsite is available for sale in the gift shop as well as fresh whole wheat bread made from Watson's Mill flour. Today, Watson's Mill still has much of the original machinery in working order. The following machinery is active in milling demonstrations:\n\nThe turbines are the most important pieces of machinery as they supply power to all the other equipment in the mill. They are the originals, cast in 1859 in the Victoria Foundry in Ottawa. The larger turbines can generate 40-horse power and the smaller one makes 20-horse power. The turbines could operate all year, because the constant flow of water through the flume never froze. The first turbine drives the feed grinder and bolter, the third drives the elevators and auger, and the fifth drives the millstones and the seed cleaner. The other three are no longer in use.\n\nAfter the wheat is weighed, it is dumped into the receiving hopper. There is a small opening at the bottom, which is controlled by a lever. It allows the miller to control the amount of wheat that enters the system. This begins the automated milling process. From this point on, the grain and grist do not come into contact with human hands until the flour is ready to be bagged. Once poured through the hopper, the grain is conveyed to the second floor, via the conveyor elevator, and stored in a large storage bin called the garner bin.\n\nMillstones can be made from a variety of materials. The stones at Watson's Mill are made from pieces of very hard quartz called buhrstone. They were imported from France in 1859. The reason for this was that native stone from Canada and the United States would chip off into the final product. The face of the stone has a pattern of grooves, which is called the dress. Different types of millstones have different patterns - Watson's Mill's millstones have a 3/4 dress. The particular dress of the stone indicates what substance it ground. The grooves on the two stones are at different angles, and they act like scissors during milling. Only the top stone, the runner stone, turns, while the bottom bedstone remains stationary. The stones each weigh about 900 kilograms, which is about the weight of a Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nTwo large iron cast wheels in front of the millstone are used by the miller to control the machinery. The small wheel allows the miller to raise and lower the top stone, or runner. The large wheel is used to open the gate to the turbine that turns the millstone.\n\nSince the top stone is so heavy, and spins quickly, a significant amount of heat is generated, which in turn warms the grist. It is important that the windows in the mill are open during milling, because dust particles are combustible. During the process, when the grist is warm and moist, it is difficult to separate the bran and chaff from the flour, so the grist needs to be cooled. The grist travels up to the attic in the grist elevator, where it falls into a machine called the auger, which cools and fluffs the grist.\n\nFrom the auger, the grist falls into the bolter. The bolter is a large sifting machine located on the second floor. The bolter separates the flour from the bran so that pure stone-ground whole wheat flour is the final product. Both products drop down to the main floor where they are separated into two different bags. The flour is then bagged into smaller portions which can be purchased at the mill.\n\nThe feed grinder introduced another method of grinding grain. Whereas the particular dress of the millstones limits what substance can be ground, the feed grinder was capable of grinding a variety of grains and seeds. This machine was mostly used to mix feed for the local farmers' animals. Today the feed grinder is used to grind corn, which the mill sells as duck chow.\n\nIn addition to the grist mill, a sawmill, carding mill and bung factory were also part of the Long Island Milling Enterprise.\n\nLocated on the opposite bank of the river, Moss Kent Dickinson and Joseph Currier built their first sawmill using their newly acquired waterpower rights to the dam. The sawmill was built sometime before 1859 and wood sawn from this mill was used in the construction of the Long Island Grist Mill (Watson's Mill). The sawmill was small in size, measuring only 72 feet by 22 feet.\nDue to the expansion of the bulkhead in 1870, this first sawmill had to be removed. Construction for a new sawmill began before the old one was torn down.\n\nThe second sawmill was larger than the first, measuring 30 feet by 100 feet. By 1876, a 20-foot addition was added to accommodate the new Canadian Bung, Plug and Spile Factory. The second sawmill was destroyed by fire over the summer of 1887.\nAlthough all physical evidence of the sawmill is now gone, it played a vital role in the creation of Manotick by providing lumber for the manufacture of woodwork for wagons, carriages, sleighs, wheels, furniture and building construction.\n\nBuilt in just eight months, the woolen carding mill was opened December 1, 1861. Located beside the gristmill, the carding mill completed the three buildings that made up the Long Island Milling Enterprise.\n\nOriginally the carding mill measured 32 feet by 30 feet, but by 1870 more space was needed and the mill was expanded to 60 feet by 30 feet. This mill was not only a place where farmers could have their wool carded and dressed, but also where custom cloth could be ordered. From 1874 to 1876, the carding mill was leased to R.W. Conway who ran the business.\nThe carding mill met its fate when a fire destroyed the entire building. The exact date of the fire is not known, but it is believed to have occurred sometime between 1879 and 1885. Although useful to farming families, the carding mill was never replaced, scratched out of Dickinson's records by Moss Kent himself.\nToday, very little remains of the carding mill, except for remnants of its foundation buried in the riverbank.\n\nMoss Kent Dickinson established the Canada Bung, Plug and Spile Factory in 1875. At the time, there was only one other operation in Canada. Dickinson shipped his bungs (wooden stoppers for barrels) all over the world\n\nAfter the Sawmill, which originally housed the bung factory, burned in 1887, Dickinson decided that only the bung mill was worth salvaging. A new building was constructed a little ways downstream and on the opposite riverbank from the gristmill.\n\nTo power the bung mill, a sixth turbine was installed in the basement of his gristmill, and a 3 inch steel cable ran out of the basement window and across the river channel to the new mill. When power was needed, a string was pulled, which rang a bell in the gristmill, notifying the miller to start the sixth turbine. The bung factory was dismantled in 1926 and moved to become part of a residence on Long Island in Manotick.\n\nOn July 1, 1963, the National Capital Commission (NCC) entered into a lease agreement with Harry Watson to open the Mill as a heritage attraction. The Rideau Valley Conservation Authority (RVCA) purchased Watson's Mill, Dickinson House and the Carriage Shed in 1972 in order to preserve this heritage landmark and the name 'Watson's Mill' was kept. The RVCA significantly restored the Mill – reopening it as a functioning grist mill and museum. In 2008, Watson's Mill Manotick Incorporated (WMMI) became the owner of the Watson's Mill property. Today, it continues to run as a functioning industrial museum and community social centre. Watson's Mill thrives with a mandate to continue operating as a flour and feed mill, as well as a social, cultural and educational focal point for its many visitors.\n\nWatson's Mill is situated on the banks of the Rideau River, in the village of Manotick, Ontario. It is built next to the control dam on the backchannel as the Rideau River splits around Long Island. Built across the other channel are the Long Island Locks. Watson's Mill is 20 km south of downtown Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThis museum is affiliated with: Ottawa Museum Network, and the Society for the Preservation of Old Mills (SPOOM).\n\n\n\n"}

Although the names of the ranks for superior officers contain the word \"Capitaine\" (\"Capitaine de corvette\", \"Capitaine de frégate\" and \"Capitaine de vaisseau\"), the appropriate style to address them is \"Commandant\", \"Capitaine\" referring to \"lieutenant de vaisseau\", which is translated as lieutenant.

They are assumed by officers ranking \"Vice-Amiral\" (Vice-Admiral).\n\nThe rank of Vice-Admiral of France () was formerly designated as Lieutenant-General of the Naval Armies until 1791, such as in the Levant Fleet and Flotte du Ponant of the Ancien Régime. Major of the French Navy has a similar history to that of the former Lieutenant-General of the Naval Armies. \n\nThe only \"Amiral de la Flotte\" (Admiral of the Fleet) was François Darlan after he was refused the dignity of Admiral of France. Equivalent to the dignity of Marshal of France, the rank of Admiral of France remains theoretical in the Fifth Republic; it was last granted in 1869, during the Second Empire, but retained during the Third Republic until the death of its bearer in 1873. The title of \"Amiral de la Flotte\" was created so that Darlan would not have an inferior rank to that of his counterpart in the British Royal Navy, who was an Admiral of the Fleet.\n\nThe insignia below depict the configuration on shoulder boards.

As a labour leader, he was a fighter for dock workers. As a soldier, he served in Malaya and later served as President of the Ex-Servicemen's League.\n\nTora held a variety of political positions, the last being as a Senator from 2001 to 2006. A convert to Islam, he represents a small minority (numbered in the hundreds) in both the indigenous Fijian and Muslim communities, the great majority of Muslims being Indo-Fijian. On 27 September 2005, he was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for offenses related to the Fiji coup of 2000.\n\nTora has a reputation in Fiji for being something of a chameleon, having championed both Fijian ethnic nationalism and multiculturalism at different times. After returning from military service in Malaya, Tora was president of the North West Branch of the Wholesale and Retail General Workers' Union. With General Secretary James Anthony, Tora led a militant strike of Oil Workers in 1959 that drew on both Fijian and Indo-Fijians for support - but was opposed by the Fijian chiefs. In 1963 Tora stood for the Western seat in the Fijian elections, but lost to Ratu Penaia Ganilau. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the first time in 1972 as a member of the National Federation Party. In 1977 when he lost his seat, he joined the Alliance Party. Following the defeat of the Alliance in the parliamentary election of 1987, he became a leader of the Taukei Movement opposed to the new government of Timoci Bavadra, which was dominated by Indo-Fijians. In December that year, he joined the interim government formed by Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, but was dismissed in 1991 for refusing, he claimed, to join the \"Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei\" Party (SVT) that had recently been founded by Mara's wife, Ro Lady Lala Mara. There has been no independent confirmation of Tora's version of why he was removed, however.\n\nIn 1992, Tora founded the All Nationals Congress Party (ANC), a multiracial party which merged with the Fijian Association Party (FAP) in 1995. In 1998, he formed the Party of National Unity (PANU), also multiracial, which joined the Fiji Labour Party and the FAP in the People's Coalition, which won a landslide victory in the general election of 1999. Four PANU candidates were elected, but Tora himself lost his seat.\n\nEmbittered by his defeat, Tora blamed Indo-Fijian voters for rejecting him. He resigned from PANU and became a vocal opponent of the new Chaudhry government.\n\nFollowing a coup d'état in May 2000, Tora was appointed Minister for Agriculture, Fishing, Forests, and the Agriculture Land Tenants Act (ALTA) in the interim government formed by Laisenia Qarase in July. After an election to restore democracy in September 2001, Qarase appointed Tora to the Senate, as one of nine primeministerial nominees in the 32-member Senate.\n\nTora announced his retirement from active politics on 28 February 2006. Fiji Village revealed that in a letter to People's National Party President Meli Bogileka, Tora had tendered his resignation as Vice-President of the party, and also withdrew his membership of the party. He said that he would continue to speak out on areas of concern, however. These included what he called the \"insubordination\" of the Military, adding that repairing the damage done to the reputation of the Army would take a long time.\n\nThe Fiji Sun reported the following day that he had made the decision to retire following the recent death of his wife. He was now 72, he said in his resignation letter, and felt that the negative aspects of his political life now outweighed the positive.\n\nTora's opponents, including Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) and Raman Pratap Singh of the National Federation Party (NFP) were quoted in the Fiji Sun on 16 March 2006 as welcoming Tora's retirement. They expressed their respect for the man despite fundamental disagreements with his nationalist views.\n\nIn August 2005, Tora spoke out to defend his role in the Taukei Movement of 2000. He insisted that it was never the intention of the movement to overthrow the Chaudhry government, but another group had taken advantage of its march to engage in vandalism.\n\nIn an angry reaction on 24 August, Commodore Bainimarama accused Tora of using fear to influence voters in the upcoming election by threatening instability if indigenous Fijian parties do not win. Bainimarama said that Tora himself has a case to answer for his activities during the 2000 crisis. \"'In 2000, Apisai Tora and a group of people at the Fijian Holdings boardroom, requested me as commander of the Military to remove Tui Vuda, Ratu Iloilo - whilst he was just a week in the Presidency,\"\" Bainimarama alleged. \"\"If he claims to be fighting for indigenous Fijian rights then he should explain to the general public why he tried to remove the Tui Vuda who is a chief of his province.\"\"\n\nBainimarama also accused Tora of using smokescreens to deceive the people. \"\"Senator Tora is using land and fisheries issues to stir up emotions in the people ... (but) the land always was Fijians' and will remain theirs,\"\" he asserted. He said that Tora and others like him were lying to the people and had to be stopped.\n\nTora immediately denied the allegations. He said that the meeting to which the Commander referred took place before Iloilo's inauguration as President, not after, and that Commodore Bainimarama must be confused. He said he was preparing a written document to defend himself, a statement that would \"surprise\" the commander, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Tora was harshly criticized for his alleged involvement in the plot against President Iloilo by fellow-Senator Ponipate Lesavua (of the opposition Labour Party) and by Ratu Epeli Ganilau, founder of the National Alliance Party, former Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, and son of the late President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau. Both expressed shock at the revelations, and Ganilau said they proved that the 2000 coup had nothing to do with indigenous Fijian rights and everything to do with selfish personal agendas, for which the Fijian people were unwittingly used.\n\nIn a statement on 29 August, Tora emphatically denied having taken part in any meeting at the Fijian Holdings boardroom where the proposal to remove President Iloilo was allegedly discussed. Tora said that the Military commander himself had forced the resignation of Iloilo's presidential predecessor, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara on 29 May 2000, and that it was therefore \"absurd\" for him to accuse others of plotting against Iloilo. He said that Commodore Bainimarama was calling the reputation of the Military into disrepute, and called on him to resign and allow \"\"a real army man\"\" to take over and restore the honour of the Military.\n\nArmy spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Orisi Rabukawaqa rejected Tora's criticism of Bainimarama, saying that the commander had the full support of his troops.\n\nOn 31 August, Tora defended his racial rhetoric, saying that racial politics was a fact of life in Fiji and that people needed to face that reality. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Qarase came out supporting Tora's version of the alleged plot against President Iloilo in 2000. Qarase said that he was at the meeting at which the request to remove Iloilo was alleged to have been made, and that no such question had ever come up.\n\nIn a separate but related matter, Tora appeared in court with 12 others on 5 September, on charges of unlawful assembly. The charge was related to their involvement in the illegal takeover of a military checkpoint on Queens Highway in the Nadi suburb of Sabeto, on 13–14 July 2000. Tora was initially acquitted on such charges on 3 November 2004, with Magistrate Syed Shah finding inconsistencies in police statements and court evidence. The Director of Public Prosecutions filed an appeal which was adjourned until 19 September, when High Court Justice John Connors overturned Tora's previously acquittal, along with that of his 12 accomplices. Connors set the last week of September for their sentencing, and remanded each of the accused on F$500 bail. Defence lawyer Iqbal Khan announced that he would prepare an appeal to be filed soon after the sentencing.\n\nOn 26 September, Justice Connors remanded Tora and his 12 accomplices in custody, pending sentencing at 9.30am the following morning. Tora's lawyer, Iqbal Khan, said that Tora had been leading a peaceful protest to call for the paramount chief of his district, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, to be appointed President. Moreover, the country was in political turmoil at the time and the accused had later reconciled with the military according to Fijian cultural norms, Khan said.\n\nKhan told the court that Tora had agreed that he should face the full brunt of the law for his actions, and was prepared as a leader of the Sabeto and Natalau villages in Nadi to take responsibility for the actions of his accomplices, who were bound by Fijian protocol to obey his orders as their \"Turaga ni Yavusa\" (tribal chief). He quoted Tora as requesting that \"\"any punishment meted out by the court be directed towards me and me only and not to any other of my co-accused.\"\" He appealed, however, for leniency to be shown to Tora on account of his old age.\n\nOn 27 September, Connors sentenced Tora to an eight-month prison sentence, and his accomplices to four months each. Connors said that a fine and a suspended prison sentence would not be appropriate, given the seriousness of the offence committed. He also said that as a traditional leader of the Fijian people, Tora was obliged to set a good example, which he had failed to do during the 2000 crisis. \"\"Those with the authority to lead have an obligation to lead in the right direction and not to encourage others to break the law,\"\" Connors said.\n\nState lawyer Samuela Qica had told the court the previous day that the maximum sentence for unlawful assembly was twelve months.\n\nLawyer Iqbal Khan applied for bail, pending an appeal against Tora's conviction, but Justice Connors refused the application on 28 September. On 1 October, Khan lodged an appeal against the refusal with the Court of Appeal, citing the ill health of Tora and two of his co-accused.\n\nDespite his imprisonment, Tora remains on the Parliamentary payroll, however, as a prison sentence of less than 12 months does not automatically cause him to forfeit his seat. If he misses, two consecutive sessions, however, his political fate will be in the hands of Senate President Taito Waqavakatoga, who is empowered to declare his seat vacant for his nonattendance.\n\nOn 29 September, Prisons Commissioner Aisea Taoka said that owing to his age and the state of his health, Tora would not be made to do any work at Natabua Prison, where he was being held.\n\nLawyer Iqbal Khan announced on 14 October that he had filed an application on Tora's behalf for him to be released on a compulsory supervision order (CSO). Whether to grant the request is at the discretion of the Minister for Justice.\n\nOn 18 November it was announced that the CSO had been granted on health grounds and that Tora had been released to serve the remainder of his sentence extramurally.\n\nTora's release was strongly criticized by Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni. Citing previous instances of persons convicted and imprisoned on coup-related charges being released ahead of time, Leweni said that Tora's parole had all the appearances of history repeating itself. He said the release raised unspecified \"national security\" concerns, and also questioned the timing, which coincided with the discovery that Fijian agents, former Military personnel, had been involved in illegally arming and training a militia on the island of Bougainville, in Papua New Guinea. Such revelations showed that \"undercurrents\" of the 2000 events were still alive, he asserted.\n\nOpposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry, however, defended the release. Chaudhry, one of Tora's fiercest adversaries, said he accepted that Tora was in poor health and should be released on compassionate grounds.\n\nNational Alliance Party President Ratu Epeli Ganilau declined to comment, saying that he needed first to clarify the grounds on which the release had been approved.\n\nIn mid-2004, Tora clashed with Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes, taking offence at a speech Hughes had made at the annual general meeting of the Pacific British Chamber of Commerce in Suva on 24 August. He said that as an Australian, Hughes should remember how his country had oppressed its Aborigine population to the point of genocide and had denied voting rights to many of them as recently as 1967. It was inappropriate, he told the Senate, for an Australian to come to Fiji attack the indigenous population. \"\"Too often these days when people speak out on certain matters there are attempts to intimidate or muzzle them and breach their rights by throwing allegations of racism or making hate speeches,\"\" he said. \"\"I would like to warn Mr Hughes to be careful,\"\" he declared. \"\"To do his own work properly and not to tread where angels fear to tread.\"\" He went on to say that the 1997 Constitution was \"\"nothing less than a fraud on the Fijian people.\"\"\n\nIn 2005, Tora came out strongly in favour of the government's controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, which aims to establish a commission empowered to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup, and has harshly attacked its detractors. In a Senate speech on 24 August 2004, he clashed publicly with the Military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama (an implacable opponent of the legislation), accusing the Military of \"playing politics.\" He also questioned how, in view of the Auditor General's report that the Military was unable to operate within its budget, it had obtained funding for its nationwide campaign against the bill, which involved soldiers visiting villages to educate the people on the Military's perception of it.\n\nTora attacked both the Labour Party and its leader, Mahendra Chaudhry, for \"\"creating political instability in the country.\"\" He said that Chaudhry was interfering with land legislation by coming between the President and the Native Land Trust Board. He said that if the Labour Party was serious about promoting good governance and the rule of law, they should denounce the political activism of the Military. \"\"It is disgraceful that NGOs, Labour Party and the media appear to condone and turn a blind eye to the army's actions. Their silence is a mark of guilt. They are guilty of failing to call the army to order over threats to the security of the country,\"\" Tora declared.\n\nTora strongly supported the recent moves to form a grand coalition of ethnic Fijian-dominated parties to contest the election planned for 2006. \"\"Anyone with political common sense know that stability and peace will be assured in this country that the government is led by Fijians and has majority,\"\" he asserted.\n\nTora is a tribal chief who hails from the village of Natalau in the Sabeto area Ba Province, and holds the traditional title of \"Taukei Waruta\", \"Turaga ni yavusa o Waruta\". Tora has been married three times. His first was an arranged marriage which lasted one year; his second was to Jane Leweniqila from Drekeniwai Cakaudrove. In 1975, he married Melania Ganiviti who died in February 2006. Tora has six children and several grandchildren.\n"}
{"id": "2330207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330207", "title": "Army ant", "text": "Army ant\n\nThe name army ant (or legionary ant or marabunta) is applied to over 200 ant species in different lineages. Due to their aggressive predatory foraging groups, known as \"raids\", a huge number of ants forage simultaneously over a certain area.\n\nAnother shared feature is that, unlike most ant species, army ants do not construct permanent nests; an army ant colony moves almost incessantly over the time it exists. All species are members of the true ant family, Formicidae, but several groups have independently evolved the same basic behavioural and ecological syndrome. This syndrome is often referred to as \"legionary behaviour\", and may be an example of convergent evolution.\n\nMost New World army ants belong to the subfamily Ecitoninae, which contains two tribes: Cheliomyrmecini and Ecitonini. The former contains only the genus \"Cheliomyrmex\", whereas the latter contains four genera: \"Neivamyrmex\", \"Nomamyrmex\", \"Labidus\", and \"Eciton\". The largest genus is \"Neivamyrmex\", which contains more than 120 species; the most predominant species is \"Eciton burchellii\"; its common name \"army ant\" is considered to be the archetype of the species. Old World army ants are divided between the Aenictini and Dorylini tribes. Aenictini contains more than 50 species of army ants in the single genus, \"Aenictus\". However, the Dorylini contain the genus \"Dorylus\", the most aggressive group of driver ants; 70 species are known.\n\nOriginally, some of the Old World and New World lineages of army ants were thought to have evolved independently, in an example of convergent evolution. In 2003, though, genetic analysis of various species suggests that several of these groups evolved from a single common ancestor, which lived approximately 100 million years ago at the time of the separation of the continents of Africa and South America, while other army ant lineages (Leptanillinae, plus members of Ponerinae, Amblyoponinae, and Myrmicinae) are still considered to represent independent evolutionary events. Army ant taxonomy remains in flux, and genetic analysis will likely continue to provide more information about the relatedness of the various taxa.\n\nThe workers of army ants are usually blind or can have compound eyes that are reduced to a single lens. There are species of army ants where the worker caste may show polymorphism based on physical differences and job allocations; however, there are also species that show no polymorphism at all. The worker caste is usually composed of sterile female worker ants.\n\nThe soldiers of army ants are larger than the workers, and they have much larger mandibles than the worker class of ants, with older soldiers possessing larger heads and stronger mandibles than the younger ones. They protect the colony, and help carry the heaviest loads of prey to the colony bivouac.\n\nMales are large in size and have a large cylindrical abdomen, highly modified mandibles and uncommon genitalia not seen in other ants. They have 13 segments on their antennae, are alated (have wings) and therefore can resemble wasps. Males are born as part of a sexual brood. As soon as they are born, they will fly off in search of a queen to mate with. In some instances where males seek to mate with a queen from an existing colony, the receiving workers will forcibly remove the wings in order to accommodate the large males into the colony for mating. Because of their size, males are sometimes called \"sausage flies\" or \"sausage ants.\"\n\nColonies of real army ants always have only one queen, while some other ant species can have several queens. The queen is dichthadiigyne (a blind ant with large gaster) but may sometimes possess vestigial eyes. The queens of army ants are unique in that they do not have wings, have an enlarged gaster size and an extended cylindrical abdomen. They are significantly larger than worker army ants and possess 10–12 segments on their antennae. Queens will mate with multiple males and because of their enlarged gaster, can produce 3 to 4 million eggs a month, resulting in synchronized brood cycles and colonies composed of millions of individuals all related to a single queen.\n\nThe army ant syndrome refers to behavioral and reproductive traits such as obligate collective foraging, nomadism and highly specialized queens that allow these organisms to become the most ferocious social hunters.\n\nMost ant species will send individual scouts to find food sources and later recruit others from the colony to help; however, army ants dispatch a cooperative, leaderless group of foragers to detect and overwhelm the prey at once. Army ants do not have a permanent nest but instead form many bivouacs as they travel. The constant traveling is due to the need to hunt large amounts of prey to feed its enormous colony population. Their queens are wingless and have abdomens that expand significantly during egg production. This allows for the production of 3-4 million eggs every month and often results in synchronized brood cycles, thus each colony will be formed of millions of individuals that descend from a single queen. These three traits are found in all army ant species and are the defining traits of army ants.\n\nArmy ants have two phases of activity—a nomadic (wandering) phase and a stationary (statary) phase—that constantly cycle, and can be found throughout all army ants species.\n\nThe nomadic phase begins around 10 days after the queen lays her eggs. This phase will last approximately 15 days to let the larvae develop. The ants move during the day, capturing insects, spiders, and small vertebrates to feed their brood. At dusk, they will form their nests or bivouac, which they change almost daily. At the end of the nomadic phase, the larvae will spin pupal cases and no longer require food. The colony can then live in the same bivouac site for around 20 days, foraging only on approximately two-thirds of these days. Among the army ants are some species that venture out only at night, but no adequate studies of their activities have been made.\n\nThe stationary phase, which lasts about two to three weeks, begins when the larvae pupate. From this point on, the prey that were previously fed to the larvae are now fed exclusively to the queen. The abdomen (gaster) of the queen swells significantly, and she lays her eggs. At the end of the stationary phase, both the pupae emerge from their cocoons (eclosion) and the next generation of eggs hatch so the colony has a new group of workers and larvae. After this, the ants resume the nomadic phase.\n\nArmy ants will split into groups when the size of the colony has reached a size threshold, which happens approximately every three years. Wingless virgin queens will hatch among a male sexual brood that hatches at a later date. When the colony fissions, there are two ways new queens are decided. A possible outcome is a new queen will stay at the original nest with a portion of the workers and the male brood while the old queen will leave with the rest of the workers and find a new nest. Another possibility is that the workers will reject the old queen and new queens will each head a newly-divided colony. The workers will affiliate with individual queens based on the pheromone cues that are unique to each queen. When new bivouacs are formed, communication between the original colony and the new bivouacs will cease.\n\nBeing the largest ants on Earth, army ants, such as African \"Dorylus\" queens have the greatest reproductive potential among insects, with an egg-laying capacity of several million per month. Army ant queens never have to leave the protection of the colony, where they mate with foreign incoming males which disperse on nuptial flights. The exact mating behaviour of the army ant queen is still unknown, but observations seem to imply that queens may be fertilized by multiple males. Due to the queen's large reproductive potential, a colony of army ants can be descended from a single queen.\n\nWhen the queen ant dies, there is no replacement and army ants cannot rear emergency queens. Most of the time, if the queen dies, the colony will likely die too. Queen loss can occur due to accidents during emigrations, predator attack, old age or illness. However, there are possibilities to avoid colony death. When a colony loses its queen, the worker ants will usually fuse with another colony that has a queen, within a few days. Sometimes, the workers will backtrack along the paths of prior emigrations to search for a queen that has been lost or merge with a sister colony. By merging with a related colony, the workers would increase their overall inclusive fitness. The workers that merge into a new colony may cause the colony to increase in size by 50%.\n\nWorkers in army ant species have a unique role in selecting both the queen and the male mate.\n\nWhen the queens emerge, the workers in the colony will form two 'systems' or arms in opposite directions. These queens that are hatched will move down either the arms and only two queens will succeed, one for each branch. Any remaining new queens will be left in the middle and are abandoned. Two new bivouacs will be formed and break off into different directions. The workers will surround the two to-be queens to ensure they survive. These workers that surround the queens are affected by the CHC (pheromone) profile emitted from the new queen.\n\nWhen males hatch from their brood, they will fly off to find a mate. For males to access the queen and mate, they must run through the workers in the colony. Males that are favoured are superficially similar in size and shape to the queen. The males also produce large quantities of pheromones to pacify the worker ants.\n\nIn a colony, the queen is the primary individual responsible for reproduction in the colony. Analysis of genotypes have confirmed that workers are, on average, more closely related to the offspring of the queen than to that of other workers, and that workers rarely, if ever, reproduce. Three factors have been suggested to rationalize the loss of worker reproduction in the presence of a queen. First, if the worker reproduces, it lowers the general performance of the colony because it is not working. Second, workers increase their inclusive fitness by policing other workers because they themselves are more related to the queen’s offspring than other worker’s offspring. Lastly, the large male larvae become too large to be transported, forcing colonies with a sexual brood to nest for a period of 41–56 days, as compared to non-reproductive colonies that remain in the nest an average of 17 days before returning to a nomadic phase. This suggests that if workers produced male offspring, they might be hatched out of sync with the queen's sexual brood and not likely to be successfully reared to adulthood.\n\nThe whole colony of army ants can consume up to 500,000 prey animals each day, so can have a significant influence on the population, diversity, and behaviour of their prey. The prey selection differs with the species. Underground species prey primarily on ground-dwelling arthropods and their larvae, earthworms, and occasionally also the young of vertebrates, turtle eggs, or oily seeds. A majority of the species, the \"colony robbers\", specialize in the offspring of other ants and wasps. Only a few species seem to have the very broad spectrum of prey seen in the raiding species. Even these species do not eat every kind of animal. Although small vertebrates that get caught in the raid will be killed, the jaws of the American \"Eciton\" are not suited to this type of prey, in contrast to the African \"Dorylus\". These undesired prey are simply left behind and consumed by scavengers or by the flies that accompany the ant swarm. Only a few species hunt primarily on the surface of the earth; they seek their prey mainly in leaf litter and in low vegetation. About five species hunt in higher trees, where they can attack birds and their eggs, although they focus on hunting other social insects along with their eggs and larvae. Colonies of army ants are large compared to the colonies of other Formicidae. Colonies can have over 15 million workers and can transport 3000 prey (items) per hour during the raid period.\n\nWhen army ants forage, the trails that are formed can be over 20 m wide and over 100 m long. They stay on the path through the use of a concentration gradient of pheromones. The concentration of pheromone is highest in the middle of the trail, splitting the trail into two distinct regions: area with high concentration and two areas with low concentrations of pheromones. The outbound ants will occupy the outer two lanes and the returning ants will occupy the central lane. The returning worker ants have also been found to emit more pheromones than those leaving the nest, causing the difference in concentration of pheromone in the trails. The pheromones will allow foraging to be much more efficient by allowing the army ants to avoid their own former paths and those of their conspecifics.\n\nWhile foraging, army ants cause many invertebrates to flee from their hiding places under leaves of the forest floor, under tree bark, and other such locations, thereby allowing predators to catch them more easily. For example, in the tropical rainforests of Panama, swarms of army ants attract many species of birds to this feast of scrambling insects, spiders, scorpions, worms, and other animals. Some of these birds are named “antbirds” due to this tendency. While focused on feeding on these invertebrates, birds at army-ant swarms typically allow very close approach by people—within 1 or 2 meters in many cases—often providing the best opportunities to see many of these species. Depending on the size of the ant swarm and the amount of prey the ants stir up, birds can number from a few to dozens of individuals. Birds that frequent army-ant swarms include the white-whiskered puffbird, rufous motmot, rufous-vented ground cuckoo, gray-necked wood rail, plain-brown woodcreeper, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, and gray-headed tanager.\n\nArmy ants do not build a nest like most other ants. Instead, they build a living nest with their bodies, known as a bivouac. Bivouacs tend to be found in tree trunks or in burrows dug by the ants. The members of the bivouac hold onto each other's legs and so build a sort of ball, which may look unstructured to a layman's eyes, but is actually a well-organized structure. The older female workers are located on the exterior; in the interior are the younger female workers. At the smallest disturbance, soldiers gather on the top surface of the bivouac, ready to defend the nest with powerful pincers and (in the case of the Aenictinae and Ecitoninae) stingers. Inside the nest, there are numerous passages that have 'chambers' of food, larvae, eggs, and most importantly, the queen.\n\nMany species of army ant are widely considered to be keystone species, due to the large number of vertebrate and invertebrate associates that rely on army ant colonies for nutrition or protection. During their hunt, many surface-raiding army ants are accompanied by various birds, such as antbirds, thrushes, ovenbirds and wrens, which devour the insects that are flushed out by the ants, a behavior known as kleptoparasitism. A wide variety of arthropods including staphylinid beetles and mites also follow colonies. The Neotropical army ant \"Eciton burchellii\" has an estimated 350 to 500 animal associates, the most of any one species known to science.\n\nHistorically, \"army ant\" in the broad sense referred to various members of five different ant subfamilies. In two of these cases, the Ponerinae and Myrmicinae, only a few species and genera exhibit legionary behavior; in the other three lineages, Ecitoninae, Dorylinae, and Leptanillinae, all of the constituent species are legionary. More recently, ant classifications now recognize an additional New World subfamily, Leptanilloidinae, which also consists of obligate legionary species, so is another group now included among the army ants.\n\nA 2003 study of thirty species (by Sean Brady of Cornell University) indicates that army ants of subfamilies Ecitoninae (South America), Dorylinae (Africa) and Aenictinae (Asia) together formed a monophyletic group, based on data from three molecular genes and one mitochondrial gene. Brady concluded that these groups are, therefore, a single lineage that evolved in the mid-Cretaceous period in Gondwana, so these subfamilies are now generally united into a single subfamily Ecitoninae, though this is still not universally recognized.\n\nAccordingly, the army ants as presently recognized consist of these genera:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2330214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330214", "title": "Nicholas Krushenick", "text": "Nicholas Krushenick\n\nNicholas Krushenick (May 31, 1929 – February 5, 1999) was an American abstract painter whose artistic style straddled the line between Op Art, Pop Art, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism and Color Field. He was active in the New York art scene in the 1960s and 1970s, before he withdrew and focused his time as a professor at the University of Maryland for almost thirty years until his death in 1999. Initially experimenting with a more Abstract Expressionist inspired style and cut paper collage, Krushenick is more well known for his paintings which use bold Liquitex colors and juxtaposing black lines, which fall under the category of pop abstraction. In fact, he is a singular figure within that style.\n\nBorn in New York City in 1929, Krushenick dropped out of high school, served in World War II, worked on constructing the Major Deegan Expressway, and then returned to art school, with the help of the GI Bill. He attended the Art Students League of New York (1948–1950) and the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Art (1950–1951). In the early 1950s Krushenick supported himself and his family by designing window displays for department stores and working for the Whitney and Metropolitan museums and the Museum of Modern Art. In 1957, he and his brother, John Krushenick, opened a framing shop on Tenth Street, which quickly turned into an artists' cooperative called Brata Gallery. Artists such as Al Held, Ronald Bladen, Ed Clark, Yayoi Kusama, and George Sugarman exhibited there. In 1962, Krushenick left the gallery and began receiving solo-exhibitions around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was a prominent painter in the New York art scene. However, in his later years, Krushenick taught at the University of Maryland, College Park from 1977 to 1991. He died in New York on February 5, 1999, at age 69.\n\nKrushenick was part of a generation emerging at a time when Abstract Expressionism had fallen out of fashion; these artists were trying to distance themselves from this style and create something new. As a result, Krushenick's work in particular straddled the lines of many styles, including: Op Art, Pop Art, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and Color Field. Some of his inspirations were Henri Matisse, J. M. W. Turner, Henri Rousseau, Fernand Leger, Alexander Calder, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg. The last two, in particular, Krushenick considered the fathers of pop.\n\nIn 1956, Nicholas Krushenick debuted alongside his brother at Camino Gallery. At this stage, Krushenick's paintings resembled the Abstract Expressionist style considerably, yet already he was starting to poise masses next to each other in something of a \"Cubist persuasion.\"\n\nBy 1959, he switched from oil paint to liquitex painting, which had an immediate effect on the brightness and saturation of his paintings. This could be considered his breakthrough moment. His paintings start to feature black lines, first as a framing device for both every individual form in the painting and the painting itself. At this stage, Krushenick was painting at a time when the art world was polarized without much respect for pop art; his sense of humor and overall joyfulness did not rest easy with the styles of the time.\n\nIn 1965, one art critic, Vivien Raynor, noted \"...he is now beginning to look Pop. Whether this is because he anticipated the movement and now looks more official, or because he's using acrylic colors, or simply because everyone to an extent becomes a victim of the audience's compulsion to organize artists into groups I can't tell.\" Yet it is important to note that only his palette resembled pop art, his subject matter made no references to Pop Culture, nor did it make any reference to any recognizable object. However, he did find inspiration in cartoon illustration and the subject matter did vaguely appear sexual: vulvar and even penetrative. By this time, he had honed in on his style, totally obscuring the visibility of the artist's hand. At first he did this with the aid of extensive drawings that became like maquettes for the painting. Over time, these drawings would become less precise and, instead, he'd rely on using tape directly on the canvas surface. This technique, in particular, was less improvisational, and thus, can be seen as a way that Krushenick further distanced himself from the Abstract Expressionist movement. By 1967, his style had become increasingly tighter, without losing its emotionality. John Perreault explained, \"In spite of the hard black, coloring-book lines that divide one shape or super-color from another, the neat flatness, and the often symmetrical composition, these paintings are systematic visual manifestations of the emotionally organic, executed with cool precision, but conceived with great gusto. The raucous candy-cane stripes that Krushenick uses as the basic device of his abstractions do not 'contain' the painting.\" In 1969, Krushenick gave up his soft brush abstract expressionist technique for bolder colors and lines similar to illustration, yet maintaining use of abstract figurative forms. This style marked him as one of the original practitioners of pop art.\n\nIn the 1970s, Krushenick began to withdraw from the New York art world. At this time, his vision began to falter and his focus turned towards education. Though he began teaching at the University of Maryland, he did continue painting. At this time, his style changed quite a bit; gone were the days of feathery, curvilinear forms. At this point, the form of the grid began to take precedent on his canvases, almost like a prescient depiction of the boom in technology that would soon arrive. Corinne Robins explains \"The new paintings like the old have a tonal feeling; but now, rather than the blare of trumpets, the buzz of an IBM machine making crazy computations comes to mind.\" In fact, during this time he was a guest artist in 17 art departments around the country. Into the 1980s and 1990s, his paintings would become busier but his colors quieter, favoring razor blade-like shapes over feathery forms and grids.\n\n1957\n1958\n1960\n1962\n1964\n1965\n1966\n1967\n1968\n1969\n1969–1970\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1975–1976\n1976\n1977\n1977–1978\n1978\n1981\n1982\n1984\n1990\n1992\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2007\n2008\n2011\n2014\n2015\n\n1963\n1963–1964\n1964\n1965\n1965–1966\n1966\n1966–1967\n1967\n1967–1968\n1968\n1969\n1969–1970\n1970\n1970–1971\n1971\n1971–1972\n1972\n1973\n1973–1974\n1974\n1975\n1976–1977\n1977\n1978\n1980\n1981\n1982–1983\n1984\n1987\n1988–1989\n1991–1992\n1997\n1998\n2001–2002\n2008–2009\n2010–2011\n2011–2012\n2014\n2015\n2016\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2330242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330242", "title": "Sarrasine", "text": "Sarrasine\n\nSarrasine is a novella written by Honoré de Balzac. It was published in 1830, and is part of his \"Comédie Humaine\".\n\nBalzac, who began writing in 1819 while living alone in the rue Lesdiguières, undertook the composition of \"Sarrasine\" in 1830. Although he had steadily produced work for over a decade (without commercial success), \"Sarrasine\" was among his earliest publications to appear without a pseudonym.\n\nDuring the period in which the novella was written, Balzac was involved in many salons, including that of Madame Recamier. Around the time in which \"Sarrasine\" was published, Balzac experienced great success with another work, \"La Peau de Chagrin\" (1831). As his career began to take off and his publications began to accumulate, Balzac developed increasingly lavish living habits and frequently made impulsive purchases (such as new furniture for his apartment and a hooded white cashmere gown designed to be worn by a monk, which he wore at night while writing), likely to distance himself from his family's prior debt, which had resulted from his business as an editor and printer's liquidation.\n\nIn 1841, an ill Balzac reached an agreement with Furne & Co., Dubochet, Hetzel and Paulin to publish \"La Comédie humaine\". In the 10 years that elapsed, Balzac had developed a political career, becoming heavily involved in high society, which influenced much of his writing. However, he continued to have financial difficulties despite his success, such as with \"La Cronique de Paris\", a magazine he founded and abandoned, though he characteristically hid his worry in order to maintain appearances.\n\nThe first volume of La Comédie humaine went on sale in July 1842. \"Sarrasine\" is part of its \"Scenes de la vie parisienne\".\n\nBalzac's \"Sarrasine\" received little attention prior to Roland Barthes' blow-by-blow analysis of the text in his book \"S/Z\" (1970). Barthes dissects the text in accordance with five \"codes\" (hermeneutic, semic, symbolic, proairetic and cultural).\n\nAround midnight during a ball the narrator is sitting at a window, out of sight, admiring the garden. He overhears the conversations of passers-by regarding the origins of the wealth of the mansion's owner, Monsieur de Lanty. There is also the presence of an unknown old man around the house, whom the family was oddly devoted to, and who frightened and intrigued the partygoers. When the man sits next to the narrator's guest, Beatrix Rochefide, she touches him, and the narrator rushes her out of the room. The narrator says he knows who the man is and says he will tell her his story the next evening.\n\nThe next evening, the narrator tells Mme de Rochefide about Ernest-Jean Sarrasine, a passionate, artistic boy, who after having trouble in school became a protégé of the sculptor Bouchardon. After one of Sarrasine's sculptures wins a competition, he heads to Rome where he sees a theatre performance featuring Zambinella. He falls in love with her, going to all of her performances and creating a clay mold of her. After spending time together at a party, Sarrasine attempts to seduce Zambinella. She is reticent, suggesting some hidden secret or danger of their partnership. Sarrasine becomes increasingly convinced that Zambinella is the ideal woman. Sarrasine develops a plan to abduct her from a party at the French embassy. When Sarrasine arrives, Zambinella is dressed as a man. Sarrasine speaks to a cardinal, who is Zambinella's patron, and is told that Zambinella is a castrato. Sarrasine refuses to believe it and leaves the party, seizing Zambinella. Once they are at his studio, Zambinella confirms that she is a castrato. Sarrasine is about to kill him as a group of the cardinal's men barge in and stab Sarrasine. The narrator then reveals that the old man around the household is Zambinella, Marianina's maternal great uncle. The story ends with Mme de Rochefide's expressing her distress about the story she has just been told.\n\n\n\"Sarrasine\" is marked by oppositions. The story opens with a description of the extremes of inside and out, day and night, beauty and ugliness, age and youth, male and female that prevail in French high society and at the de Lanty's ball. Whereas the ball is young and full of life, the mysterious old man who enters it stands out as the mark of opposition. \"If I look at him again, I shall believe that death itself has come looking for me,\" says one beautiful young woman. \nThe most significant opposite in the entire novella is male versus female. The story contemplates what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman, and the degree to which those stand in opposition. The story also touches on oppositions between the generations, as Sarrasine himself is opposite to his father, on oppositions between the art world and the political world, on oppositions between France and Italy, and on oppositions between the ideal and the real.\n\nRoland Barthes identifies castration as one of the novella's main concerns. Zambinella is a castrato. Because women were not allowed on stage, castrati regularly played the parts of women. The tradition of the castrati ended in France before it did in Italy, and when Sarrasine arrives in Italy and meets Zambinella, he does not know about it. Because Zambinella has the voice of a woman Sarrasine assumes La Zambinella is a woman. La Zambinella suggests that her womanhood might be in question, but Sarrasine is too enthralled with La Zambinella as the perfect woman to pay any attention. When Sarrasine finally learns Zambinella is a castrato, he first denies the possibility, then tries to kill La Zambinella, upon which he is himself killed. Critics point out that Sarrasine may fear a kind of contagion of castration, or may feel that manhood in general or the division between men and women is threatened by possibility of castration. The novella ends with Mme de Rochefide and the narrator's condemning the castrato tradition as barbarian.\n\nHomosexuality is a common theme found in many of Honoré de Balzac's works, for example \"Illusions perdues\" (1837–43). In \"Sarrasine\", we meet Zambinella, a seemingly beautiful woman whom Sarrasine admires, but who turns out to be castrato. Sarrasine, who took Zambinella to be his ideal woman, is deeply distressed when he learns this and tries to kill Zambinella. One possible explanation for Sarrasine's extreme reaction is that he fears that his love of La Zambinella is a mark of homosexuality. Sarrasine's reaction, then, can be seen as an attempt to protect his heterosexuality. Zambinella does, in fact, have a partner: the cardinal. In \"Sarrasine\", the cardinal is Zambinella's \"protector\", which means that Zambinella would be the complementary role of \"\"mignon\"\". Barthes refers to Zambinella as \"\"mignon\"\" as it is used in French court society, where it means the homosexual lover, or \"pet\", of a man in power, in this case the cardinal, the \"protector\".\n\nBalzac's use of a frame story is the most significant narrative strategy in \"Sarrasine\". In the frame story, an unnamed, male narrator tells the story in the first person to Mme de Rochefide, his guest at a ball. They come into close contact with a mysterious old man and see a beautiful painting. The narrator promises to tell Mme de Rochefide the story of the painting and the old man. The body of the novella and the framed story that the narrator relates to Mme de Rochefide are about Ernest Jean Sarrasine and his unusual relationship with Zambinella. Balzac also employs nonlinear narration in \"Sarrasine\": the framed story takes place many years earlier than it is related, and a few times the narrator jumps to the present and then returns to telling the framed story.\n\nSarrasine gives us a closer look at the role of castrati in both common opera and in religious tradition. Catholicism in Italy dictated that there could be no female singers, and the high voice parts were usually played by either prepubescent boys or castrati. In order to become a castrato, a boy had to give up his \"manhood\", i.e., have his testes removed at a very early age. Because of the popularity of Italian opera throughout 18th-century Europe (except France), castrati such as Farinelli, Ferri, Pacchierotti, and Senesino became the first operatic superstars, earning enormous fees and hysterical public adulation. However, many did not survive the surgery, or did not last very long after it. Castrati developed many health problems, as testosterone is needed for healthy growth in boys, and without the glands that supply the majority of testosterone during a critical period of development, the body does not grow correctly. Besides the only wanted side effect (the lack of lengthening the vocal cords), a castrato's arms and legs were often disproportionally long, they did not have much muscle mass, and other problems, such as osteoporosis and erectile dysfunction were common later in life. The story of Sarrasine is made much more believable by the fact that, due to their severe hormonal imbalance, castrati often developed real breast tissue, a condition called gynecomastia.\n\nFrench literature flourished in the nineteenth century. Among the most famous authors from this time period is Victor Hugo, who was known for works such as \"Les Misérables\" (1862), \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" (1831), and \"The Toilers of the Sea\". Hugo was also known for influencing Romanticism, a movement that spread to France in the 1820s and emphasized a sense of individuality and emotion. In his novel \"Les Misérables\", Hugo represents Romanticism and individuality with the character of Marius Pontmercy, who by attempting to court the character Cosette by sending her letters that reveal his love for her, adheres to Romantic movement ideas and beliefs.\n\nEqually important is Gustave Flaubert, known for his use of realism influenced by Honoré de Balzac. Realism appears perhaps most famously in Flaubert's first (and perhaps most famous) novel \"Madame Bovary\" (1856). This novel represents the \"real\" experiences and feelings of a French woman who is obsessed with, and eventually dispossessed of, her romantic ideal of love. In \"Salammbô\" (1862), Flaubert abandons realism for historical fiction with an account of the Mercenary Revolt in Tunisia during the 3rd century BCE. Flaubert then returns to realism in \"L'Éducation Sentimentale\" (\"Sentimental Education\", 1869) with a detailed account of lives during the revolution of 1848 in France. Other influential authors from this period, include Marie-Henri Beyle (better known by the pseudonym Stendhal) and Charles Baudelaire.\n\nRealism is an artistic movement originated in France in the 19th century by people who rejected both Idealism and Romanticism. The use of Romanticism in literature began to rise dramatically in the 18th century and was the predominant artistic movement in France until Realism. Realism was widely appreciated by people who opposed the inflated ideas of passion and drama that mark Romanticism. Those in the Realist movement wanted instead to portray the truth in every situation, avoiding exaggerating a scenario to emphasize only its good or bad qualities. Realism also strove to represent life as it was experienced in its more mundane details by imperfect men and women rather than idealized characters in idealized situations. Realism tends to describe middle or lower class milieux in order to paint a picture of the regular life of a majority of the population at the time the literature was written. From the people to the places, Realism strove to present everything in an undramatic and \"true\" manner.\n\nIn \"Sarrasine\", Realism is reflected in the ways that every situation is described in its positive and negative aspects. For example, as a member of the castrati Zambinella can be praised, adored, or treated as if he doesn't belong. The novella doesn't romanticize the relationship between Zambinella and Sarrasine, either. The author depicts real and imperfect emotions between the two characters, from love to vengeance. Though Realism in literature was usually used for portraying the activities of middle and lower-class people, it was sometimes used in situations like this, and indeed often focused on characters and situations that might otherwise be socially marginalized.\n\n\"Sarrasine\" makes many references and allusions to other sources, often to literature (Lord Byron, Ann Radcliffe, Jean-Jacques Rousseau), music (Gioacchino Rossini), religion, and the arts (Girodet's \"Endymion\", Michelangelo). The most important allusions are to the figures of beauty in Greek culture: Adonis, Endymion and Pygmalion. The intertexuality between \"Sarrasine\" and the myth of Pygmalion is a vital one, as it establishes the tragedy of misconception: Sarrasine creates a statue of the \"female\" La Zambinella, only to discover later that his subject wasn't a real \"woman\" as Sarrasine—that \"a real woman is born from the statue\". Furthermore, the replication of the statue into marble, and into two separate portraits (Adonis, and Girodet's \"Endymion\") only perpetuates the symbolic notion that Sarrasine is always influenced by an intrinsic gender ambiguity.\n\nThe composer Richard Beaudoin is writing an opera based on \"Sarrasine.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2330251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330251", "title": "Apostolic United Brethren", "text": "Apostolic United Brethren\n\nThe Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) is a Mormon fundamentalist group that promotes polygamy. The AUB has had a temple in Mexico, since at least the 1990s, an endowment house in Utah since the early 1980s and several other locations of worship to accommodate their members in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. \n\nThe title \"Apostolic United Brethren\" is not generally used by members, who prefer to call it \"The Work\", \"The Priesthood\", or \"The Group\". Those outside the faith sometimes refer to it as the \"Allred Group\" because two of its presidents shared that surname. Members of the AUB do not refer to their organization as a \"church\" and, unlike nearly all other Mormon fundamentalist groups, regard The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as a legitimate, if wayward and diminished, divine institution.\n\nReligious scholar J. Gordon Melton characterised the group as \"the more liberal branch of the Fundamentalist movement\", as the group allows sexual relations apart from the strict purpose of procreation.\n\nThe group came into the Hollywood spotlight with the release of the hit reality TV series \"Sister Wives\" aired in 2010.\n\nThe AUB furnished a detailed description of their beliefs and practices in August 2009 to the Utah Attorney General's \"Polygamy Primer\", which was later revised in 2011. This booklet is used to educate the law enforcement and social relief agencies involved with similar groups.\n\nThe AUB is unrelated to other similarly named groups such as Churches of the Brethren and Apostolic Pentecostals.\n\nAs of 1998, there were approximately 10,000 members of the AUB, most of whom reside in Utah and Mexico. The headquarters of the AUB is in Bluffdale, Utah, where it has a chapel, a school, archives, and a sports field.\n\nThe AUB has communities in Rocky Ridge, Utah; Harvest Haven (a subdivision in Eagle Mountain, Utah); Cedar City, Utah; Granite Ranch, Juab County, Utah; Pinesdale, Montana; Pleasant Valley, White Pine County, Nevada; Lovell, Wyoming; Mesa, Arizona; Humansville, Missouri; Mount Pleasant, Utah; Southeast Idaho; and Ozumba, Mexico. It operates at least three private schools; many families also home-school or send their children to public or public charter schools.\n\nThe AUB's members tend to integrate with their surrounding communities, much more so than some other Mormon fundamentalists, such as members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church). This can largely be attributed to the AUB's former prophet, Owen A. Allred, and his desire to be up front with local law enforcement and the news media, especially when it came to ending rumors of underage, arranged marriages that many other fundamentalist Mormon groups were known for. Allred believed that transparency was key in helping the community see that the AUB and its members were not a threat.\n\nThe AUB is headed by a President of the Priesthood. Next in authority is a Priesthood Council (of which the President is a part). Below the Priesthood Council are Presidents of the Seventy, the Seventy quorum members, high priests, elders, Aaronic Priesthood members, the Women's Relief Society, Sunday School, Girls Class, Boy Scouts, and the Children's Primary organizations. On a local level there are Bishops, Priesthood Council representatives.\n\nGeneral Sacrament Meeting and Sunday School meetings (as well as many private family Sunday Schools) take place on Sundays, as do Priesthood meetings. Relief Society (a women's organization), Girls Class, Primary, and Scouting take place throughout the week.\n\nDances, firesides, musical events, plays, and classes are often held at meetinghouses.\n\nThe AUB regards the Book of Mormon as sacred scripture in addition to the Bible, and accept the Articles of Faith written by Joseph Smith to summarize Latter Day Saint beliefs. The AUB teaches that the LDS Church is still fulfilling a divine role in spreading the Book of Mormon and other basic doctrines of Mormonism, and in facilitating genealogy.\n\nMembers of the AUB are known for their belief in plural marriage. Other key beliefs include the United Order, the Adam–God doctrine, and what is commonly called the \"1886 Meeting\". While not all members take part in plural marriage, it is considered a crucial step in the quest for obtaining the highest glory of heaven.\n\nAUB members regard the LDS Church as an important vehicle in spreading Mormonism's introductory teachings, particularly through the LDS Church's missionary program and the widespread publication of the Book of Mormon. The group's founder, Rulon C. Allred, told a fundamentalist congregation in 1966: \"We are specifically instructed through John Taylor by Joseph Smith and Jesus Christ, and by Joseph Musser as well that we are not to interfere ... with the function of the [LDS] Church.\" On November 16, 1966, in another discourse, he commented: \"[We] are not in a position to dictate to the [LDS] Church, or to presume that we preside over [LDS Church] President David O. McKay, or that we can send missionaries into the fields of labor, or that we can in any way dictate the affairs of the Church.” \"God’s Church is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" Allred declared. He further explained in 1975: \"We are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, no matter who may decry it or who may deny it.\" \"We are functioning within the spiritual confines of the Church,\" he commented, \"but we are definitely outside of its legal organization.\"\n\nUnder his leadership, the Allred group did no missionary work or temple work, leaving those responsibilities to the LDS Church. He predicted in 1975 that \"the time is at hand when God is going to intervene in the matter, and the temples will be opened to us, and we will have our endowments and do our own work for our dead.\" Under his brother Owen's leadership, the AUB constructed its own endowment houses for ordinance work; this was in response to the LDS Church's policy change which extended priesthood and temple blessings to all races.\n\nDrew Briney, an author on Mormon polygamy, former AUB member and appeals attorney, summarized AUB members' general sentiment toward the LDS Church:\n\nThe \"AUB\" accepts the mainstream LDS Church as Christ's Church but views it as \"out of order\" just as the Israelites were \"out of order\" at the time of Christ—still accepted, just somewhat prodigal. Its members are taught that they should not disparage the LDS Church and its leaders teach that \"the mother church\" should be respected by the \"father\" (AUB or \"the priesthood\") the same as a husband should take care of and honor a wayward wife inasmuch as he is able to do so. Incidentally, AUB's leaders commonly concede that no organization is exempt from being out of order to some degree (including the AUB) but they emphasize that the LDS Church has abandoned many doctrines taught by the early brethren—not just plural marriage. Some of these doctrines include: Adam-God teachings; united order or \"full consecration\"; proper conferral of the priesthood; the ban on blacks receiving the priesthood; the doctrine of dissolution; the kingdom of God as a separate organization from the Church; the ordinance of rebaptism; the ordinance of mother’s blessings; giving a complete temple endowment (as opposed to the shortened version now administered in the LDS Church); the wearing of a full length, unaltered garment; the unchanging nature of all ordinances; prayer circles outside of the temple; the law of adoption (sealing men to men as father/son); and the teaching that a living prophet can never lead you astray—even if he strays from teachings and revelations of previous prophets.\n\nThe AUB's claims to authority are based around the accounts of John Wickersham Woolley, Lorin Calvin Woolley and others, of a meeting in September 1886 between LDS Church president John Taylor, the Woolleys, and others. Prior to the meeting, Taylor is said to have met with Jesus Christ and the deceased church founder, Joseph Smith, and to have received a revelation commanding that plural marriage should not cease, but be kept alive by a group separate from the LDS Church. The following day, the Woolleys, as well as Taylor's counselor, George Q. Cannon, and others, were said to have been set apart to keep \"the principle\" alive, including sufficient priesthood authority to perform marriage sealings and pass on that authority.\n\nMembers of the AUB see their history as going back to Joseph Smith and to the beliefs he espoused and practices he established. They believe that the LDS Church has made unacceptable changes to doctrines and ordinances. The members of the AUB see it as their responsibility to keep them alive in the form they were originally given and to live all the laws God has commanded. Each doctrine or practice changed or abandoned by the LDS Church is in turn perpetuated by the AUB.\n\nUntil the 1950s, Mormon fundamentalists were largely one group, but with the ordination in 1951 of Rulon C. Allred by Joseph W. Musser, who then presided over the fundamentalists, the fundamentalists in Colorado City, Arizona (formerly known as Short Creek), became more distant. Within a few years they formed their own group, which is now the FLDS Church.\n\nThe shooting of Rulon C. Allred by Rena Chynoweth on May 10, 1977 (under the direction of Ervil LeBaron), brought the AUB into the spotlight. Allred was succeeded by his brother, Owen A. Allred, who died in February 2005 and was replaced by his appointed successor, J. LaMoine Jenson. Jenson died in September 2014 after a battle with colon cancer, and was replaced by his appointed successor, Lynn A. Thompson.\n\nSince 2016 a number of AUB members in Pinesdale, MT have separated themselves and formed their own group with their own meetings. No leader has emerged for this breakaway group yet. This group has taken to calling itself \"the Second Ward\".\n\nRod Williams, a Secret Service agent involved in Watergate and a former member of the AUB, claimed in sworn testimony, as part of the Virginia Hill lawsuit, that he stole copies of LDS Church's temple ordinances from the Seattle Temple at the behest of Owen Allred, a claim denied by Allred.\n\nAccording to one former member, attorney John Llewellyn, \"plural wives [of AUB men] are sent into nearby Hamilton to apply for welfare as single mothers. The informant reported that welfare checks are often taken directly to the priesthood leaders.\"\n\n\n\n"}

A game with considerable expectations given the teams' intense rivalry and respective success that year, the SaberCats surprised everyone by posting the most dominant victory in ArenaBowl history, holding the Rattlers scoreless until the final period, and winning the game by the lopsided score of 52-14 to earn their first Arena Football League title in franchise history. Arizona's 14 points are the second-lowest in ArenaBowl history, just above the Chicago Bruisers' 13 points in ArenaBowl II. With the SaberCats' victory, Darren Arbet also became the first African-American head coach in pro-football to win a championship in North America.\n\nFor much of the 2002 season, the San Jose SaberCats were entertaining the possibility of an undefeated year, which would have been and would still remain a first for the Arena Football League. The SaberCats' roster included superstars such as Bob McMillen, Omarr Smith, Mark Grieb, Barry Wagner, Sam Hernandez, and rookie sensation Clevan Thomas; of those, only Grieb is not currently enshrined in the Arena Football League Hall of Fame. They defeated their Western Division rivals, the Arizona Rattlers, 52-51 in the season opener, and continued their success en route to a 12-0 start. However, their rematch with the Rattlers in Phoenix on July 12 cost them not only their undefeated record, but also starting quarterback Mark Grieb, who suffered a season-ending broken collarbone in the SaberCats' 59-52 loss. Though it would prove to be San Jose's only loss of the season, it set the stage for what figured to be an extremely competitive ArenaBowl championship game.\n\nThat was not the case, however, as coach Arbet's San Jose squad took a 24-point lead by halftime, and extended it to 45-0 early in the fourth quarter before Arizona finally scored on a touchdown pass from Sherdrick Bonner to Maurice Bryant with 9:24 remaining in the contest. Each team scored one more touchdown, and the SaberCats emerged with a 52-14 blowout victory.\n\nQuarterback John Dutton, who replaced Grieb following the injury, continued to roll as he had throughout the playoffs, completing 20 of 26 passes for 236 yards and five touchdowns (three to James Hundon) and earning MVP honors. Wide receiver/defensive back Omarr Smith was named the Ironman of the Game, as he had four receptions and also led a San Jose defense that forced three Rattler turnovers. San Jose won the Foster Trophy for the first time in franchise history, while the loss would prove to be the first of three consecutive ArenaBowl failures for Arizona, though they would be significantly more competitive in their future championship game appearances.\n\n1st Quarter\n2nd Quarter\n3rd Quarter\n4th Quarter\n\n"}

He and his partner had a monopoly for many years of fur trade with the large Osage tribe on the Missouri River. In addition, he had numerous business interests in St. Louis and was well-connected with the various rulers: French, Spanish and American.\n\nOn September 20, 1748, Marie-Thérèse Bourgeois married René Auguste Chouteau, who had recently immigrated from France to Louisiana. René Chouteau was described as an innkeeper, liquor dealer, and pastry chef. He was born in the village of L'Hermenault in September 1723, and was nearly ten years older than Bourgeois. Auguste Chouteau was the only child of Marie-Thérèse and René, born in either September 1749 or September 1750. The elder Chouteau purportedly abused Marie Therese, and the abandonment of her and their son, led Marie Therese to return to her per-matrimonial home. Some scholars say that she returned to the convent. Others believe that she returned to her step-father's and mother's house. In either case, a child named \"René\" was baptized on that date to René Chouteau and Marie-Thérèse. However, the Auguste Chouteau who founded St. Louis, Missouri, often was referred to as René-Auguste, but his birth date was listed in family records as September 26, 1750. Family members in the 19th century used the traditional date (September 26, 1750) for Chouteau's grave marker in Calvary Cemetery. In René Chouteau's will, he referred to two living sons in 1776. Thus, it is possible a second son existed. In that case, it is likely that the second son died after René Chouteau left Louisiana.\n\nBy 1758, Marie-Thérèse (known as Madame Chouteau or Widow Chouteau) had met and began living with Pierre de Laclède Liguest (commonly known as Laclede) in a common-law marriage. Kieran Doherty suggests that Laclede informally adopted Auguste Chouteau, providing him with an education in one of the Catholic schools of New Orleans. Regardless of whether formal education was provided Chouteau, it was clear that by his early teens, he had a respect for learning and some form of education (possibly under the direct tutelage of Laclede). By the early 1760s, Chouteau worked as an assistant in obtaining supplies for Laclède's partnership business with Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, and served as a clerk in Laclede's journey up the Mississippi River to establish another fur-trading post. \n\nThough highly influenced by Laclede, many historians have also commented on his mother's character and intelligence that proved to be exceptionally important throughout his entire life. With a strong business sense and acumen, she would have helped developed his senses that later proved to be very effective and helpful in later years.\n\n Maxent and Laclède formed a partnership in the early 1760s to build a French trading post on the west bank of the Mississippi River north of the village of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. They began buying supplies in early 1763, and on July 6, 1763, they obtained the necessary license from the French territorial government to trade with the Native Americans (primarily those living near the Missouri River). Starting in August 1763, Chouteau, Laclède and some 30 other men traveled upriver from New Orleans to Ste. Genevieve with trade goods. By November, the group arrived at Ste. Genevieve, but Laclède found that the village did not have adequate storage for his goods. As it had been settled near the riverbank on bottomland, Laclede \"deemed the location insalubrious\" for his business. (After repeated flooding, in the 1780s the residents relocated Ste. Genevieve upriver and inland to higher ground.)\n\nThe French garrison just across the river at Fort de Chartres agreed to store the goods until the British arrived. (Following the Seven Years' War, the French conceded their territory and installations to the victorious British. The fort was to be turned over to the British according to the Treaty of Paris (1763). The commandant of Illinois, Pierre-Joseph Neyon de Villiers, suggested French settlers should relocate from the Illinois Country to New Orleans. (He thought it would be under French control, as he did not know of the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762) to give control of the area west of the Mississippi to the Spanish). Because of the postwar upheaval, \"instead of just establishing a trading post at the mouth of the Missouri, [Laclède] would create an entire community.\" Laclede believed he could convince many French to move to the west bank of the Mississippi at his new settlement. He planned to store the goods until spring, and then have Chouteau and his team build the trading post at the site they selected in December 1763. As Chouteau wrote, Laclède said, \"You will come here as soon as navigation opens, and will cause this place to be cleared, in order to form our settlement after the plan that I shall give you.\"\n\nIn the late winter, Chouteau fitted out a boat and led a party of 30 men across the river, where they landed on February 14, 1764. The next day, February 15, Chouteau directed the men to start clearing and founded the European city of St. Louis. (It was on a site long occupied by indigenous tribes, as demonstrated by the numerous massive earthwork mounds left from the Mississippian culture of the 9th-12th century.)\n\nLaclede was at Fort de Chartres until early April, recruiting French settlers from the east side villages. Because of a large migrating band of Osage, Laclede went to St. Louis to negotiate their departure from the fledgling post. Within months, Laclede had built a home for his common-law wife Marie Therese, who traveled to the outpost from New Orleans, arriving in September 1764. Auguste Chouteau lived here until his death. In addition to Auguste, Marie-Thérèse had an additional four children (by Pierre Laclede, but under the surname of Chouteau). Among these four were three girls and a boy, Jean Pierre Chouteau, who later became a partner with Auguste in business and politics.\n\nAfter Laclede's death in 1778, Chouteau took over the business of trading, adding greatly to the family fortunes. He quickly expanded the business to include agricultural properties, and banking, and owned the first grist mill in St. Louis. Chouteau played a significant role in the growth of other, outlying towns, such as St. Charles, Missouri.\n\nChouteau also remained on good terms with the Spanish government in St. Louis. In 1780, Chouteau played a small role in the Battle of St. Louis, in which the village was defended against a British-led Native American attack. Chouteau negotiated with the Spanish government for greater defense of the city, and for his efforts was commissioned a captain and later a colonel.\n\nIn the early 1780s, Auguste Chouteau played a pivotal role in trade between the village and Native American tribes. His efforts to maintain peace and promote trade led him to establish (along with his brother, Pierre) numerous trading forts along the Missouri River.\n\nHis relationship with the Osage Nation became particularly important when, in 1787, the Spanish governor Esteban Miro ordered an end to trade with the Osage and began to prepare for war against them as a result of fighting between Osage and European settlers. Although the government continued its ban on trade with the Osage, Chouteau was able to defuse a conflict between Osage and Spanish-armed settlers through his intervention with Miro. In spite of continuing problems between the Osage and the Spanish government, Chouteau maintained good relations with the tribe. Although the trade ban was lifted in 1791, problems continued among Mississippi tribes and the settlers, including horse theft and threatened attack on an Osage delegation in St. Louis by rival tribes of Sac, Fox, Kickapoo, Mascouten and Winnebago warriors.\n\nIn 1793, these problems culminated in an order from the Spanish Governor General Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, in which all trade between settlers and tribes was to cease. Hector also ordered a military expedition against the Osage and other tribes. However, Hector was persuaded toward peace by an Osage delegation led by Chouteau to New Orleans in the spring of 1794. To convince Hector of peace, Chouteau promised a military fort built among the Osage at his own expense. In return, Chouteau was given a six-year monopoly on trade along the Osage River. After its construction in 1795, Fort Carondelet, although acting as a military base, was in practice a trading post for the Chouteau family. The fort also served as home to Chouteau's nephews, who gained valuable experience as traders. Through contacts at this post, Chouteau also negotiated construction of a second trading post among the Osage, located on the Verdigris River in eastern Kansas from 1795 to 1797.\n\nHowever, in 1799, new Spanish Governor General Manuel María de Salcedo began favoring a Spanish businessman instead of the Chouteau fur operation. Fort Carondelet was sold to the Spanish firm, but Chouteau continued trade with the Osage on the Verdigris. Yet the Spanish competition was short-lived, as the Louisiana Territory was transferred first to France in 1800, then the United States in 1803. Late that year, Chouteau provided valuable information to the Lewis and Clark Expedition about the population of the Louisiana territory, along with observations of wildlife and local villages. In early 1804, Lewis and Clark purchased materials from Chouteau's trading house in St. Louis, and on March 9, 1804, Chouteau hosted the new American commander of the Upper Louisiana during the transfer ceremonies for the Louisiana Purchase. For this, Chouteau was rewarded with a return to his monopoly on trade with the tribes by the United States. From 1806 to 1815, Chouteau continued leading family fur trade business, eventually negotiating part of the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815 after the War of 1812. In 1816, Auguste Chouteau retired from his trading businesses. Still active in Indian issues in 1817, Chouteau served as a U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs with William Clark in the first U.S. treaty with the Ponca tribe.\n\n\"For more information on the Chouteau family and places named for the Chouteau family, see Chouteau.\"\n\nAuguste Chouteau never left the St. Louis area (although he had numerous lengthy trading journeys up the Missouri to his outer posts and to trade with the Indians.) He married Marie Therese, the daughter of Jean-Gabriel Cerré, on September 21, 1786 at the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France (then a vertical-log church, not the current church on the site). The marriage united members of the two leading St. Louis families; it also appears to have been a happy one. (It is possible that Chouteau had relations with indigenous American women while on lengthy trading expeditions, but that was considered customary behavior at that time.) They were renowned for their hospitality, which helped strengthen his political position in the city and region.\n\nChouteau died February 24, 1829. His remains were interred first at the burial grounds near the Basilica of St. Louis, but were reinterred at Calvary Cemetery. After his death, 22 of his 36 slaves were sold at probate, providing $10,838.88 in proceeds, half of which was provided to his wife, with the other half being divided equally among their seven children.\n\nChildren of Auguste Chouteau and Marie Therese Cerre:\n\n\n"}

Its origin is at the lateral margin of the first rib, before which it is called the subclavian artery.\n\nAfter passing the lower margin of teres major it becomes the brachial artery.\n\nThe axillary artery is often referred to as having three parts, with these divisions based on its location relative to the Pectoralis minor muscle, which is superficial to the artery. \n\nThe axillary artery is accompanied by the axillary vein, which lies medial to the artery, along its length.\n\nIn the axilla, the axillary artery is surrounded by the brachial plexus. The second part of the axillary artery is the reference for the locational descriptions of the cords in the brachial plexus. For example, the posterior cord of the brachial plexus is so named because it lies posterior to the second part of the artery.\n\nThe axillary artery has several smaller branches. The branches can be remembered, in order, when traveling from the heart, with the mnemonics \"Screw The Lawyers Save A Patient\", \"Summertime: The Lakers Schedule Another Parade\", \"Sixties Teens Love Sex And Pot\", or \"She Tastes Like Sweet Apple Pie.\" The origin of these branches is highly variable (e.g. the posterior and anterior circumflex arteries often have a common trunk).

The anastomotic network surrounding the scapula provides an alternate path for collateral circulation to the arm from arteries including the dorsal scapular artery and suprascapular artery.\n\nThe right axillary artery is often used as an arterial cannulation site in cardiac surgery, particularly for repair of aortic dissection and replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch.\n\n"}

The work survives in an epitome assembled at the end of the 1st century CE, based on a lost original with some possible relation to the work of Eratosthenes of Cyrene; thus the author is alluded to as Pseudo-Eratosthenes. The pseudepigraphic attribution to Eratosthenes presumably was meant to bolster the work's credibility, but while the \"Catasterismi\" describes constellations, it is more concerned with the mythological narrative attached to each than with the mathematical tradition of astronomy. Although there is no absolute distinction between astronomy and astrology in antiquity, intellectual circles in Alexandria during the 1st BCE began to distinguish between astrology for making predictions and astronomical observation for scientific conjecture.\n\n\"Catasterismi\" records the mature and definitive development of a long process: the Hellenes' assimilation of a Mesopotamian zodiac, transmitted through Persian interpreters and translated and harmonized with the known terms of Greek mythology. A fundamental effort in this translation was the application of Greek mythic nomenclature to designate individual stars, both asterisms like the Pleiades and Hyades, and the constellations. In Classical Greece, the \"wandering stars\" and the gods who directed them were separate entities, as for Plato; in Hellenistic culture, the association became an inseparable identification, so that Apollo, no longer the regent of the Sun, actually \"was\" Helios (Seznec 1981, pp 37–40).\n\nChapters 1–42 of \"Catasterismi\" treat forty-three of the forty-eight constellations (including the Pleiades) known to Ptolemy (2nd century CE); chapters 43–44 treat the five planets and the Milky Way. \n\nThe work cites in some places the lost \"Astronomia\" attributed to Hesiod. Many of the mythic themes in \"Catasterismi\" are simply drawn from Aratus, \"Phaenomena\" (\"ca\" 275 BCE) and the sequential arrangement is essentially that of Aratus as well. On the other hand, a similar later account is the \"Poeticon Astronomicon\", or \"De Astronomica\" (tellingly also titled \"De Astrologia\" in some manuscripts that follow Hyginus' usage in his text) attributed to Gaius Julius Hyginus. \n\nDuring the Renaissance, printing of \"Catasterismi\", invariably attributed to Eratosthenes, began early, but the work was always overshadowed by Hyginus, the only other ancient repertory of catasterisms. \"Catasterismi\" was illustrated by woodcuts in the first illustrated edition by Erhard Ratdolt, (Venice 1482). Johann Schaubach's edition of \"Catasterismi\" (Meiningen 1791) was also illustrated with celestial maps drawn from another work, Johann Buhle's Aratus (Leipzig, 2 volumes, 1793–1801).\n\nAfter the old Teubner edition of A. Olivieri, \"Pseudo-Eratosthenis Catasterismi\" (Leipzig 1897), the text has a new complete edition including the recensio Fragmenta Vaticana\n\n\n"}

It is still used in educational electronic kits and teaching laboratories in schools. It is designed to grip a bare wire securely, yet release it with the push of a tab. The clip was patented February 26, 1907 by John Schade Jr., assigned to Fahnestock Electric Co. Less than 2 weeks after the patent was issued they filed for reissue.\n\nIt consists of a single flat piece of springy metal, bent over itself to form a clip. Pushing down on the end of the metal tab opens a hole through which a bare or stripped wire can be inserted. Releasing pressure allows the tab to spring back, closing the hole and gripping the wire to form an electrically sound mechanical connection. Pushing the tab again releases the grip on the wire so it can be withdrawn.\n\nModern banana plugs will usually fit into a Fahnestock clip, although the fit is tight.\n\nFahnestock clips were commonly made of phosphor bronze or spring steel and plated with tin or copper for good electrical conductivity and corrosion-resistance. Most Fahnestock clips seen today are nickel-plated.\nFahnestock clips were seen on early radio receiver breadboard construction, model train power connections, and the like. They were also available on early dry batteries. Today, they have largely been supplanted by binding posts. However, they remain in use in elementary schools especially, where their ease of use and visible connections make them a popular way for science instructors to teach the creation of simple circuits, and most university physics departments still have them on apparatus.\n\nFahnestock clips are also used as safety devices on the arming wires of aircraft bombs; their grip on smooth bare steel wire is sufficient to prevent the wire from being withdrawn from a fuze during normal handling but light enough to allow the wire to be withdrawn when the weapon is released.\n"}

The Fenian force, withdrawing from Ridgeway, met a small force of Canadian militia at Fort Erie, then known as the village of Waterloo.\n\nIn response to the Fenian occupation of the township of Fort Erie, Ontario on the night of June 1, 1866, militia units throughout the Niagara Peninsula had been mobilized or put on alert. At Port Colborne, a detachment of 51 gunners and N.C.O.s, British Royal Artillery bombardier Sergeant James McCracken and 3 officers (Captain Richard S. King M.D., Lieutenants A.K. Schofield and Charles Nimmo [Nemmo]) taken under command by Lieutenant-Colonel John Dennis, boarded a tugboat, the \"W.T.

But when John O'Neill returned with most of his large army from the nearby Ridgeway, the small number of Canadian volunteers that were sent to capture a small numbers of Fenian soldiers were not prepared. A firefight followed, in which the militia and sailors were outnumbered by Fenian soldiers causing most of the Canadian volunteers to surrender.\nThe remaining Canadian volunteers on the gunboat went back to Port Colborne to inform of the situation while O'Neill the Fenian soldiers stayed in Fort Erie. Later, an estimated 5,000 Canadian militia reinforcements informed of the situation came and surrounded the Fenian movement’s army in Fort Erie. Causing O'Neill to retreat back to New York State. Some Fenians chose to desert, crossing the river on a variety of stolen or improvised craft. The remainder, 850 in number, crossed in a body and surrendered to a U.S. naval party from the near Buffalo, putting an end to Fenian incursions along the Niagara Peninsula.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2330343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330343", "title": "S/Z", "text": "S/Z\n\nS/Z, published in 1970, is Roland Barthes' structural analysis of \"Sarrasine\", the short story by Honoré de Balzac. Barthes methodically moves through the text of the story, denoting where and how different codes of meaning function. Barthes' study made a major impact on literary criticism and is historically located at the crossroads of structuralism and post-structuralism.\n\nBarthes' analysis is influenced by the structuralist linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure; both Barthes and Saussure aim to explore and demystify the link between a sign and its meaning. But Barthes moves beyond structuralism in that he criticises the propensity of narratology to establish the overall system out of which all individual narratives are created, which makes the text lose its specificity (différance) (I). Barthes uses five specific \"codes\" that thematically, semiotically/semiologically, and otherwise make a literary text reflect structures that are interwoven, but not in a definite way that closes the meaning of the text (XII). Barthes insists on the (different degrees of) plurality of a text — a plurality that should not be reduced by any privileged interpretation. He also flags the way in which the reader is an active producer of interpretations of the text, rather than a passive consumer. (II).\n\nBarthes defines five codes that define a network (or a topos) that form a space of meaning that the text runs through. But these codes and their mutual relations are not clear structures, and do not close the multivariance of the text. Thus, Barthes defines the code vaguely: Each of the units of the text marks a virtual digression toward a catalogue of other units. Each code also appears as voices that altogether weave the text, though each of them for a while may dominate the text. (XII)\n\nTwo of the codes are sequential and structure the text in an irreversible way (XV): The hermeneutic code (HER) denotes an enigma that moves the narrative forward; it sets up delays and obstacles that maintain suspense. The proairetic (ACT) code organises (small) intertwined sequences of behaviors, each sequence has its own regularity that does not follow the narrative's logic (though it is used in it). (XI)\n\nThe rest of the codes are reversible (XV). Two of them structure the text: The semic code (SEM) designates a special kind of signifiers (e.g. person, place, object) to which adhere unstable meanings and that enable the development of a theme through the story. (XI, LXXXI) The symbolic code (SYM) are meanings that are constitutive (stemming from the fields of rhetoric, sexuality, or economy), but cannot be represented in the text, except in metonymies, which renders the text open to different interpretations (XI, XCII).\n\nThe last, cultural code (REF) refers to meanings external to the text: in science or wisdom (sagesse). (XI)\n\nBarthes does not provide an overall structure for how the codes are integrated because he wants to preserve the plurality (multivalence) of the text. Since reading is plural (IX), a different reading (reader) might invoke the codes differently and combine them differently ending up with a different understanding. Moreover, whereas the classical text tends to enforce a particular model of integrating the codes, the modern plural text does not. (XII)\n\nAs Barthes guides the reader through the entirety of Balzac’s text, he systematically notes and explains the usage of each of these codes as they occur. He also offers a more academic outline of the text in Annex 3.\n\nThe hermeneutic code is associated with enigmas of the text, puzzles and mysteries that the text may or may not eventually answer but will most likely defer and misdirect that answer, keeping the reader guessing. When Barthes identifies an enigma in the text he marks it HER (short for hermeneutic). The process of revealing truth by solving enigmas is further broken down in the following sequence (LXXXIX):\nBecause the hermeneutic code involves a move from a question to an answer it is one of the two codes (the other being the proairetic or action code) which Barthes calls “irreversible” (XV): Once a secret is revealed, it cannot be unrevealed—the moment of cognition is permanent for the reader. Compared to the detailed sequential actions of the proairetic code, the hermeneutic code encompasses bigger questions about the entire narrative or situation of the story.\n\nThe proairetic code encompasses the actions or small sequences of the narrative (Annex 2) which creates narrative tension. By telling us that someone 'had been sleeping', we now anticipate them waking up, thus creating a small structure of narrative tension and expectation. Out of these units, the whole narrative has a forward drive. This is connected with Barthes' notion of the “readerly” text. The reader assimilates distinct pieces of information in a prescribed order. Even acts of psychological introspection in the novel are classified by the reader in terms of the occurrence of movements or activities. Thus, the proairetic code constitutes the text as a location with spatial and temporal dimensions through which the reader moves.\n\nThe semic code concerns meaning but at the level of connotation in relation to character, that is the meanings beyond the 'literal' denotation of the words: the resonances, additional linguistic associations associated with character. The semic code will thus work to construct an evolving character through signifiers like name, costume, physical appearance, psychological traits, speech, and lexis, which may also have different connotations in different contexts elsewhere in the story.\n\nThe symbolic code produces a structure of (often paired) symbolic meanings that accumulate throughout the text to establish a larger structure in which the meanings of the story unfold. These symbolic clusters of meanings might be around such oppositions as male/female, inside/outside, hidden/revealed, hot/cold. Some of the key symbolic processes in \"Sarrasine\", according to Barthes, are (1) rhetorical (transgression of the rhetorical figure: antitheses), (2) sexual (transgression of the sex: castration), and (3) economic (transgression of the origin of wealth) (XCII). This structure is not itself stable and the work of the 'writerly' reader is to pursue these structures until they begin to break down, a symbolic collapse that is a key part of the pleasures of the text.\n\nThe cultural code is constituted by the points at which the text refers to common bodies of knowledge. These might be agreed, shared knowledge (the real existence of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré) or an assertion of axiomatic truths (the assertion in the first sentence that all men daydream at parties, no matter how lively the party is). He calls the latter a 'gnomic code'.\n\nThe five codes together constitute a way of interpreting the text which suggests that textuality is interpretive; that the codes are not superimposed upon the text, but rather approximate something intrinsic to the text. The analogy Barthes uses to clarify the relationship of codes to text is to the relationship between a performance and the commentary that can be heard off-stage. In the “stereographic space” created by the codes, each code becomes associated with a voice. To the proairetic code Barthes assigns the Voice of Empirics; to the semic the Voice of the Person; to the cultural the Voice of Science; to the hermeneutic the Voice of Truth; and to the symbolic the Voice of Symbol.\n\nBarthes endeavours to set up a primary structure of character relations in \"Sarrasine\" along the lines of gender. However, he subsequently defines the characters not in relation to biological gender, but rather along what he calls the “axis of castration.” The initial categorisation of the characters in phallic terms (the men who are the phallus, the women who have the phallus, and the ambiguous group of the androgynous and the castrated) gives way to the division he later constructs between the castrated and castrating, the passive and active. Furthermore, Barthes’ structuralist analysis exposes the fact that Balzac’s text has multiple signifiers that do not refer to one fixed signified. For example, Barthes is fascinated by the nuance of the double entendre, which most clearly fractures the traditional conception of signification: this play on words proffers two distinct and incompatible meanings that must be entertained simultaneously by the reader. The title \"S/Z\" refers to the clash between the ‘S’ of ‘Sarrasine,’ the male protagonist of the work, and the ‘Z’ of ‘Zambinella,’ the castrato with whom Sarrasine falls in love. Sarrasine is an artist who, functioning under the assumption that all beauty is feminine, regards Zambinella as the epitome of beauty, and therefore as the paradigm of femininity. Sarrasine’s Pygmalion-like sculpted image of the “female” La Zambinella accordingly represents the “complete woman.” This “masterpiece,” however, is highly problematic given its original starting point as a male body — and its refashioning into a female one through the psychological projections and artistic expertise of a man. What ultimately grounds the text is the fundamental destabilisation caused by Zambinella’s anatomy, which is perceived by Sarrasine as masterpiece, origin, and referent: in Zambinella, therefore, lies Sarrasine’s own potential for castration.\n\n"}

York), a college student transformed into a werewolf who undergoes a quest to rid himself of his curse by killing the apparent originator of his 'bloodline,' a drifter named Janos Skorzeny (the character's name is a reference to the name of the vampire in the classic TV film \"The Night Stalker\") played by Chuck Connors (in his last television role). While pursuing Skorzeny, Cord himself is pursued by the persistent bounty hunter \"Alamo\" Joe Rogan (Lance LeGault). Later, Cord hunts Nicholas Remy (Brian Thompson), the real originator of the bloodline.\n\nThe show aired a two-hour pilot and 28 half-hour episodes before being cancelled in 1988. In the United Kingdom the series aired on Sky One from 1989-1990.\n\nEric Cord is a college student whose average life comes to an end on the night that his roommate Ted hands him a gun loaded with silver bullets. Ted is a werewolf who has been killing people, and tells Eric to kill him, seeing this as his only way out. A red pentagram on Ted's right palm is the sign that the metamorphosis is coming. Confronted with Eric's disbelief, Ted decides to prove his situation, and asks Eric to tie him up in a chair and wait until midnight, at which time he'd either see for himself or call in professional help. When midnight comes, Ted transforms into a werewolf, forcing his friend to shoot and kill him-but not before he manages to bite Eric. Before long, Eric discovers a pentagram on his own palm, and soon after undergoes his own transformation into a seven-foot-tall werewolf. Now on the run for his friend's murder, Eric Cord spends the remainder of the series on a quest to find and kill the originator of his bloodline, the mysterious Janos Skorzeny, which will break the curse.\n\nThe series was similar in tone and formula to shows like \"The Fugitive\" and \"The Incredible Hulk\", but achieved a contemporary feel by mixing a decidedly rock soundtrack with suspense-themed music. Eric wandered from place to place, hitchhiking, taking odd jobs and befriending various characters whose paths he crossed along the way, before invariably being transformed by his werewolf curse just in time to save his new friends from the clutches of some evildoer. Though Eric appeared to have no control over his actions while in werewolf form and typically retained no memory of them afterward, he seemed to prey almost exclusively on villainous characters, never attacking or killing an innocent person. There were hints as the series progressed, however, that this self-control was slowly eroding, as indeed Ted had warned him it would, threatening to destroy Eric's conscience/will if he could not end the curse soon.\n\nNear the end of the series' run it was revealed that the originator of Eric Cord's bloodline was not, in fact, the evil Janos Skorzeny, but rather an even more powerful and malevolent werewolf named Nicholas Remy (played by Brian Thompson). The series ended before Eric could be rid of his curse.\n\nThe special effects techniques used in production were considered first-rate and impressive for the time, specifically the transformation sequences, in which, for example, the pentagram-shaped scar on Eric's right hand would rise, thicken and grow three-dimensionally, and begin to bleed.\n\nAccording to script editor Allan Cole, after the series had started production, Chuck Connors wanted to renegotiate his contract for more money. Various episodes written to feature Skorzeny were shot without Connors—using only scenes with Skorzeny in his werewolf form, plus a human body double with no dialogue. Series creator Frank Lupo asked Cole and Chris Bunch to kill off Skorzeny in \"To Dream of Wolves\". Connors agreed to return for his finale, according to Cole. The script was originally written as a three-parter with Connors in the first two parts, but two days before shooting Cole and Bunch were informed that Connors would not take part. The first two episodes were collapsed into one, all of Skorzeny's new dialogue was cut (aside from flashback scenes of young Skorzeny played by a different actor), and Skorzeny's part was rewritten to show him cravenly (and silently) kneeling before Remy. In the final fight between Eric and Skorzeny, Eric now scarred his foe with acid and then electrocuted him—allowing Connors' human-form body double to play the death scene in disfiguring makeup.\n\nParts of the series were shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nIt was co produced by John Ashley.\n\nThe werewolves in the show were immune to the effects of aging or disease, with the exception of Skorzeny himself. Although Skorzeny was apparently a young man as shown in a flashback scene when he was bitten by Nicolas Remy in the 19th century, he appeared to be in his mid sixties in 1987. Nicolas Remy explained to Eric Cord that Skorzeny was slowly dying from a \"sickness brought about by his own evil\", that was decaying him from within. Nicolas Remy himself was over two thousand years old, yet appeared to be a man in his late 30s with the exception of a streak of gray hair near his right temple.\n\nThe werewolves in the series were apparently vulnerable to harm in their human forms from ordinary weapons but with no permanent effects. In an episode titled \"A World of Difference\", Eric is shot dead in human form (he was just beginning to undergo the metamorphosis), only to resurrect in the morgue by transforming into his werewolf form at sunset. In another episode titled \"Nightmare at the Braine Hotel\", Eric meets a werewolf named Servan, who tells him a story in which he had been executed by hanging in his human form. He seemed greatly amused by the memory of the looks on his executioners' faces as he leapt off the undertaker's table when he transformed at sunset and rose from death. Another werewolf character, a hobo named Hank who was featured in the episode \"King of the Road\", dies in his human form from having his throat cut, only to resurrect in his werewolf form as soon as night falls. This ability is reminiscent of the \"Eddie Quist\" character in \"The Howling\", who is shot dead by police during the beginning of his transformation at the adult movie theater, only to come to life later by transforming in the morgue.\n\nThe werewolves themselves transformed into large, almost bearlike bipedal wolves with long simian arms that allowed them to run on all fours as well as two. All the werewolves transformed by sprouting fangs, claws and fur, except for Skorzeny, who peeled back the skin of his face to reveal the werewolf form within. In their human forms they had no traditionally distinguishing marks, such as eyebrows meeting over the bridge of their nose, or hair on the palms of their hands. It was also never explored as to whether or not werewolves could reproduce sexually in their human bodies.\n\nAlthough the werewolves did completely recover from wounds made by non-silver weapons, the series never explored whether or not werewolves could regenerate missing limbs. Skorzeny, who wore an eye patch over his left eye, did seem to regenerate his missing eye when he transformed into his werewolf form. But when he returned to his human form, he once again wore the eye patch. It was explained that Remy is the one who cut out his eye in the episode \"to dream of wolves.\"\n\nWerewolves in this series did not transform during the full moon; The pentagram on their palm was the only signal that the metamorphosis was approaching. In the pilot, Eric Cord's roommate Ted stated that its appearance was very random, and that he had not discerned any pattern to when or how often the metamorphosis would occur. Older werewolves like Skorzeny and Remy had the ability to induce the metamorphosis without the appearance of the pentagram, unlike Eric, who seemed to be at the mercy of the curse's cycle. In the episode \"To Dream of Wolves\", Remy also showed an ability to shapeshift single body parts at will, as shown when he shapeshifted his right arm into its werewolf shape to kill Dianne for disobeying his order to kill Eric. Remy also seemed to have a form of psychic control over those of his bloodline: In \"To Dream of Wolves\", he toys with Eric by telepathically forcing him to press a silver dagger to his own throat, drawing blood.\n\nWhile the bite of a werewolf was the standard way to pass the curse to another person, blood transfusion appeared to be effective in the episode titled \"Big Daddy\". No mystical talismans, salves or hexes seemed to have any place in the series. It was also never suggested that the curse was hereditary.\n\nThe werewolves had only three known weaknesses mentioned in the series; Any weapon made from silver, being killed by another werewolf or suicide.\n\nEric is told of other bloodlines by Gray Wolf in the episode of the same name. It is unknown if it is a complete list or just the bloodlines that he knew of.\n\nIn July 1988, Blackthorne Publishing released a five-issue comic book series based on the show.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Chiller aired reruns of \"Werewolf\". Chiller premiered the series with a marathon on June 6, 2007.\n\n\"Werewolf: The Complete Series\" was to be released on DVD by Shout! Factory by October 6, 2009, but was later pushed two weeks to October 20, 2009 to include special features. The release was eventually cancelled because of a music license issue concerning 3 songs. As a result, no official DVD release exists.\n\nThe two-hour pilot was released in the UK in PAL VHS format by Entertainment in Video.\n\n"}

Loring Brace\n\nCharles Loring Brace IV (December 19, 1930 – September 7, 2019) was an American anthropologist, Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan's Department of Anthropology and Curator Emeritus at the University's Museum of Anthropological Archaeology. He considered the attempt \"to introduce a Darwinian outlook into biological anthropology\" to be his greatest contribution to the field of anthropology.\n\nBrace was born Charles Loring Brace IV in Hanover, New Hampshire in 1930, a son of writer, sailor, boat builder and teacher, Gerald Warner Brace and Hulda Potter Laird. His ancestors were New England schoolteachers and clergymen including John P. Brace, Sarah Pierce, and the Rev. Blackleach Burritt. Brace's paternal great-grandfather, Charles Loring Brace, founder of the Children's Aid Society, had worked to introduce evolutionary theory into the United States and knew Charles Darwin. C. Loring Brace developed an early interest in biology and human evolution as a child in part by reading Roy Chapman Andrews's popular book \"Meet your Ancestors\", A Biography of Primitive Man (1945). He entered Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he constructed his own major from geology, paleontology, and biology courses.\n\nBrace was drafted by the U.S. Army during the Korean War and while in the service, worked with the fitting of gas masks so that they would be able to fit a variety of different people. He entered Harvard University in 1952 and studied physical anthropology with Ernest Hooton and later with William W. Howells, who introduced Brace to the new evolutionary synthesis of Darwinian evolution and population genetics. During this time he was also able to travel to Europe, where he spent 1959-1960 at Oxford University, in the animal behavior laboratory of Nikolaas Tinbergen, and traveled to Zagreb, Yugoslavia, where he inspected the collection of Neanderthal fossils collected by Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger at Krapina.\n\nBrace completed his Ph.D. in 1962. He taught briefly at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and then at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He spent much of his career as Professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan and as Curator of Biological Anthropology at the university's Museum of Anthropology.\n\nIn 1962, Brace published a paper in \"American Anthropologist\" titled \"Refocusing on the Neanderthal Problem\" where he argued, in opposition to French anthropologist Henri Vallois, that the archeological and fossil evidence did not necessarily support the idea that the Neanderthals were replaced by Cro-Magnon populations migrating into Europe, rather than being ancestral to early \"Homo sapiens\".\n\nBrace continued his reappraisal of the Neanderthal problem in 1964 in \"The Fate of the 'Classic' Neanderthals: a consideration of hominid catastrophism\" published in \"Current Anthropology\". Here Brace traced the history of research on the Neanderthals in order to show how interpretations established early in the century by Marcellin Boule and notions such as Arthur Keith's pre-sapiens theory had convinced many anthropologists that the Neanderthals played little or no role in the evolution of modern humans. Brace argued that cultural factors, especially the increased use of tools by Neanderthals, produced morphological changes that led the classic Neanderthals to evolve into modern humans.\n\nBrace remained a vigorous proponent of the idea that Neanderthals are ancestral to modern humans. He also argued that the fossil record suggests a simple evolutionary scheme whereby humans have evolved through four stages (Australopithecine, Pithecanthropine, Neanderthal, and Modern humans), and that these stages are somewhat arbitrary and reflect our limited knowledge of the fossil record. Brace emphasized the need to integrate the ideas of Darwinian evolution into palaeoanthropology. Much earlier research into human origins relied on non-Darwinian models of evolution; Brace presented his advocacy of the Darwinian approach in \"The Stages Of Human Evolution\", first published in 1967.\n\nBrace's ideas generated considerable controversy, as much for his brash criticism of his colleagues as for their content, but they have also influenced a generation of anthropological research into human evolution and the interpretation of the Neanderthals.\n\nIn the publication \"Clines and clusters versus Race: a test in ancient Egypt and the case of a death on the Nile\", Brace discussed the controversy concerning the race of the Ancient Egyptians. Brace argued that the \"Egyptians have been in place since back in the Pleistocene and have been largely unaffected by either invasions or migrations\".\n\nIn a 2006 publication \"The questionable contribution of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age to European craniofacial form\", Brace argued that Natufian peoples, who are thought to be the source of the European Neolithic, had Sub-Saharan African admixture, but that \"the interbreeding of the incoming Neolithic people with the in situ foragers diluted the Sub-Saharan traces that may have come with the Neolithic spread so that no discoverable element of that remained.\"\n\n\n"}

The family of Baczewski was of distant Valachian descent and signed itself with the Sas coat-of-arms.\n\nThe Baczewski family was one of the most illustrious and wealthiest families in Lwów before World War I and in the interbellum period during the Second Polish Republic. Their residence was at the Lviv market square Nr. 31, which also housed a Baczewski vodka store on the ground floor. The house was renovated in 1923.

Baczewski was a Polish company best known for its fine spirits such as vodka and gin. The factory, dating back to the late 18th century, was based in Lwów (Lviv) and until 1939 was one of two most popular Polish export goods.\n\nIn 1782 a distillery run by the Baczewski family was founded in Wybranówka, a small suburb of the city of Lwów, capital of Galicia, then part of Austrian Empire, now in Ukraine.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the firm was inherited by the founder's great grandson, Józef Adam Baczewski. A graduate of Lwów University of Technology and a specialist in spirits technology, Józef Adam refurbished and significantly expanded the factory. He also bought new production lines in France, the Netherlands and built a new refinery. He also started to export Polish spirits to other European countries, including France, United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. This started the popularity of Polish vodka abroad. Józef Adam was one of the first businessmen in Central Europe to introduce marketing on a large scale. To distinguish his vodkas and liqueurs from other brands available to Europeans, he ordered all export spirits to be sold in crystal carafe rather than bottles. With time all Baczewski's bottles were turned into carafes as well. In 1894, during the National Fair in Lwów, the carafe-shaped pavilion of J.A. Baczewski company was chosen as the most interesting exhibition - and the most visited. The marketing strategy also included advertisement in press, on leaflets and posters.\n\nAfter Józef Adam's death in 1911, the firm was inherited by two of his sons, Leopold and Henryk. The former was a graduate of the Chemical Faculty of the Vienna University and took over the production while the latter was a lawyer and continued their father's active marketing strategy. They also introduced new brands, until their times sold only locally. When Poland regained her independence in 1918, the company had a well-established name and the brothers decided to stay with their father's name rather than change it to include their own name. The popularity of the spirits was so great that in many Polish books and poems of the epoch, the brand \"Baczewski\" was used as a synonym to \"vodka.\"\n\nIn the Interbellum the company was run by Leopold's son, Stefan Baczewski. He decided not to increase the volume of production to preserve the prices and the quality. To promote the most luxurious of the products, Stefan also signed contracts with two of the Polish trans-Atlantic ocean liners, the M/S Piłsudski and M/S Polonia. He was also the first spirits producer to transport his products by plane on a daily basis. Since the 1930s the liquors from Lwów were shipped to Paris, Vienna and Prague by plane. In an interesting example of marketing, some of the clear 40% vodkas produced by J.A. Baczewski company were labelled with the brand and a small slogan saying that \"the only vodka of comparable quality is produced by Pierre Smirnoff of Russia.\" The Lwów-based Smirnoff factory introduced a series of similar labels. Baczewski distillery was \"the\" leading and most popular Polish distilleries in terms of quality and reputation. Its two flagship products were \"Monopolowa\" and \"Perła\".\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the factory was bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Lwów. After the city was seized by the Soviet Union, the remnants were levelled to the ground and an emery paper factory was built in its place. However, the brand continued to live as a synonym of quality. Its popularity was maintained by many notable writers and poets of the epoch, including Marian Hemar and Feliks Konarski (Ref-Ren). Last bottles of Baczewski's spirits were sold for huge prices even 30 years after the war.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Eduard Gessler, the owner of the \"Altvater Gessler\" company in Vienna, Austria, distantly related to the Baczewski family, reacquired the J. A. Baczewski mark. Under Eduard Gessler’s guidance, Gessler and J. A. Baczewski united under the combined name \"Altvater Gessler - J. A. Baczewski\", with its principal place of business in Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe reconstituted company continued to specialize in quality alcoholic products for domestic consumption in Austria and for export to various countries in various continents, to include Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, most notably the United States. Its centuries old reputation and record of quality led to its being selected as the only representative of the Austrian liquor industry at the International World Fair in Chicago in 1950.\n\nEduard Gessler was responsible for the reintroduction of J. A. Baczewski Vodka \"Monopolowa\". Monopolowa is a distinctive potato vodka, produced of a traditional formula, imbued with a distinct intensity, smoothness, depth of flavor and complexity of character, all attributable to a “back-to-basics” tradition of being distilled from potatoes. (Vodka, native to Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, as well as Russia, was traditionally assumed to be made from potatoes. Presently, most other vodkas are produced from grain.)\nFollowing Eduard Gessler’s death in 1979, his son Elek Gessler consolidated the affairs of both traditional companies into one new legal entity in 1980, which to this day is known as \"Altvater Gessler - J. A. Baczewski GmbH”, an Austrian corporation. In 1983, Elek Gessler established \"Altvater Gessler - J. A. Baczewski International (USA) Inc.\", a New Jersey corporation, to manage United States operations. To this date, both companies are owned solely by the Gessler family.\n\nAfter the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, the Starogard Gdański-based branch of the Polmos company started to produce several of J. A. Baczewski's products under license from Altvater Gessler - J. A. Baczewski International (USA) Inc. However, in the late 1990s the license was terminated and production in Poland was halted.\n\nTo this date the \"J. A. Baczewski\" trademark is owned by Altvater Gessler - J. A. Baczewski International (USA) Inc.\n\n\n"}

From 1999 to 2017, Gearan was the president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York, the longest serving president in the history of HWS. On March 1, 2018, Gearan became the 19th Director of The Institute of Politics (IOP) at Harvard University.\n\nWhen he concluded his presidency in 2017, he had served for 18 years, leading the Colleges through a period of unprecedented growth. In recognition of his service, the HWS Board of Trustees awarded Gearan an honorary degree and named him President Emeritus of the Colleges, the first time in HWS history that the board bestowed the honor.\n\nFollowing his final year at HWS, Gearan joined Harvard University as 'President in Residence' working on important issues facing higher education and the next generation of leaders at the Graduate School of Education. His position at Harvard reflects Gearan's stature in higher education where he has held leadership roles in numerous organizations including chair of National Campus Compact, chair of the Corporation for National and Community Service, chair of the Annapolis Group of selective liberal arts colleges, and chair of the Talloires Network Steering Committee, an international organization of college and university presidents from six continents committed to civic engagement.\n\nGearan was born in Gardner, Massachusetts and attended public schools there. Gearan earned his A.B. in government cum laude at Harvard University in 1978 and his J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1991. At Harvard he was the college roommate of future lawyer and conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt. His cousin is Anne Gearan, political correspondent at \"The Washington Post\".\n\nGearan's early interest in politics began when he helped distribute leaflets in Jesuit priest Robert F. Drinan's campaign for Congress on a strong anti-Vietnam War platform in 1970. \"As an eighth-grader growing up in Gardner, I had noticed that a Catholic priest was running for Congress amid the political turmoil of the Vietnam era,\" said Gearan. \"From my early days on a bike leafleting the neighborhoods of Gardner, I graduated to driving the congressman,\" Gearan added. While an undergraduate at Harvard, Gearan interned in Drinan's Washington office and worked on Drinan's re-election campaign in 1978. It was there that Gearan met his future wife, Mary Herlihy, a fellow staffer in Drinan's office.\n\nGearan worked as a newspaper reporter for the Fitchburg, Massachusetts \"Sentinel and Enterprise\" for one year. After leaving the newspaper, Gearan was chief of staff for U.S. Representative Berkley Bedell of Iowa for three years. In 1983, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis appointed Gearan Director of Federal-State Relations for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a post he held until 1988 when Gearan joined Dukakis' campaign for the Presidency.\n\nWhen Dukakis ran for the presidency in 1988, Gearan originally had the high-profile job of managing Dukakis' campaign during the crucial Iowa caucuses. When Gary Hart dropped out of the race, the Dukakis campaign replaced Gearan with Hart's Iowa coordinator and sent Gearan back to Boston to be the campaign's national headquarters Press Secretary. Although Gearan was disappointed by the decision, he accepted it. \"You know, it's a long life, and there aren't too many other things in politics but loyalty,\" he said when asked about the incident.\n\nWhen Bush announced on August 17, 1988 that he was selecting Dan Quayle as his running mate after previously saying he planned to keep his choice secret until later during the convention, Gearan had one of the sharpest comments. \"We learned something about George Bush today. He can't keep a secret,\" said Gearan. \"and he can't stand up to the pressure of the right wing.\" As Dukakis' Press spokesman, Gearan was frustrated by Republican negative campaigning and supported Dukakis' decision to respond. \"There comes a time when you respond,\" said Gearan. \"The dogs days of August are over.\" Gearan added that Bush had falsely accused Dukakis of opposing the Stealth bomber and the D-5, a nuclear missile used on the Trident submarine.\n\nAfter the election Gearan said that one of the mistakes Dukakis made after winning the Democratic nomination was not re-introducing himself to the American people. \"One of the big mistakes we made in 1988 was we assumed people knew who Michael Dukakis was,\" said Gearan. After Dukakis' defeat, Mr. Gearan returned to run the Massachusetts Office of Federal Relations until 1989. Gearan was Executive Director of the Democratic Governors Association from 1989 to 1992. As executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, Gearan offered George Bush a slogan for his 1992 re-election campaign with a double-entendre: \"Bush in '92. You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet.\"\n\nIn 1991 Gearan was offered the job of Clinton's campaign's communications chief while Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Gearan was unable to accept because his wife was in a difficult pregnancy that confined her to bed for much of the time. \"This was a very exciting time in our lives,\" Gearan said. \"And Mary was quite sick and had left her job. In the beginning stages, it was one of those deals where we weren't sure how it was going to go. I was not able to move to Little Rock and give the 1,000 percent that was required at the time to Governor Clinton, because I was distracted.\" When Clinton's effort floundered in New Hampshire amid allegations of extramarital affairs and draft dodging, Gearan flew to New Hampshire to help salvage Clinton's candidacy.\n\nAfter Clinton won the nomination, Gearan became Al Gore's campaign manager during his run for the vice presidency. Gearan's job was to ensure that the message Gore delivered reflected the views and strategies of the head of the ticket. \"It is a critical role and needs someone with a lot of skills,\" said George Stephanopoulos, director of communications for the Clinton campaign. \"But he has Clinton's utmost confidence and really gained the respect of Gore and his staff.\" Gearan had the ability to keep things light during the grueling campaign. Once while accompanying Al Gore during the 1992 campaign Gearan noticed an old piano at his campus residence at the University of Missouri. Gearan is a talented piano player so when told that ragtime music composer Scott Joplin had once played the piano, Gearan sat down and played part of \"Maple Leaf Rag.\" \"I'm never washing these hands again,\" he said.\n\nAfter the election Gearan was named Deputy Director of the Clinton/Gore Transition Team in 1992 in charge of Washington operations for Transition Director Warren Christopher. \"I came back to Washington after working for Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 and I was a knucklehead,\" said Gearan. \"I came back in 1992 and I was a genius. It makes you realize there are centrifugal forces beyond our control. I guess one is always a knucklehead-in-training.\"\n\nDuring the Clinton Administration Gearan served several roles. He began as White House Deputy Chief of Staff. He was then promoted to Assistant to the President of the United States and Director of Communications and Strategic Planning. Gearan traveled extensively with the president on overseas trips to Russia, Japan, the Middle East, Germany, Italy, and Ireland. Gearan helped shepherd Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer through his confirmation hearings in 1994 and said that managing a successful confirmation requires thorough research, an aggressive media strategy, intense lobbying on Capitol Hill and it also helps to expect the unexpected. \"There's only so much you can game out,\" said Gearan.\n\nOn June 22, 1995 President Clinton announced his nomination of Gearan to head the Peace Corps. \"I am proud to nominate him to lead our Peace Corps into the 21st century, to keep the vision and the spirit of John Kennedy alive and the dream of America alive all over the world,\" said Clinton.\n\nThere was some controversy over Gearan's appointment as Peace Corps Director since he had not served in the Peace Corps himself and was succeeding Carol Bellamy, who was the first Peace Corps Director to have served as a volunteer. The National Peace Corps Association (NPCA), an organization made up of returned volunteers, had urged President Clinton to appoint a former volunteer to the position rather than Gearan. However Gearan was strongly supported by other returned volunteers including Donna Shalala, Clinton's Secretary of Health and Human Services, who had served in the Peace Corps in Iran and who addressed the NPCA at their annual meeting on August 4, 1995 in Austin, Texas. \"I want to talk with you about the President's new nominee -- Mark Gearan. I am Mark Gearan's friend. We have worked closely together for the past two and a half years. He is a decent, thoughtful, energetic and caring man,\" said Shalala. \"I strongly support the President's decision to nominate him. He will do a great job for all of us. Please support him,\" Shalala added.\n\nGearan was confirmed by the United States Senate and sworn in as the 14th Director of the Peace Corps in September 1995 was director of the Peace Corps from 1995 to 1999. During Gearan's tenure as Peace Corps Director, the Peace Corps opened programs in South Africa, Jordan, Mozambique and Bangladesh and returned its volunteers to Haiti after a five-year absence. On March 1, 1996, the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Peace Corps, Gearan spoke about its relevance today: \"You answered President Kennedy's call, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.' You provided needed assistance to 130 countries around the globe, and you continue that service here at home.\"\n\nOn June 29, 1998, the United States and China formalized the Peace Corps program in China signing an agreement that established a formal framework for a Peace Corps program in China. Twenty-one volunteers arrived to begin their assignments in Sichuan province, where the Peace Corps has operated on a pilot basis since 1993. President Clinton, in China for a state visit said \"This agreement represents an important step forward in building the bonds of friendship between the American and Chinese people. As in the other 80 countries where they work, Peace Corps Volunteers in China reflect the finest traditions of Americans' idealism and pragmatic approach to assisting others.\"\n\nOne of Gearan's most successful initiatives was the creation of the Crisis Corps, that would send former Peace Corps volunteers into crisis areas for six months or less to help during emergencies. However Gearan later regretted that he had not moved faster in creating the corps. \"I lost time and ground because I sought a broad range of opinions for starting the Crisis Corps even though I knew it was a good idea. Today it exists -- and it is one of my proudest achievements.\"\n\nOn January 3, 1998, President Clinton proposed to expand the Peace Corps from about 6,500 volunteers to 10,000 volunteers by the year 2000. \"President Clinton's initiative to put the Peace Corps on the path to have 10,000 volunteers serving overseas by the year 2000 is one of the most important developments in the history of the Peace Corps,\" Gearan said. \"The President's initiative would result in a 50 percent increase in the number of Peace Corps volunteers. This is a strong affirmation of the contributions of 6,500 volunteers currently serving in 85 countries, as well as the work of more than 150,000 Americans who have joined the Peace Corps since 1961.\" However the initiative failed to gain political traction or substantially increased funding in Congress and by the end of Clinton's term in office, the number of volunteers had made only modest gains increasing to about 7,100.\n\nOn June 1, 1999, President Clinton announced that Gearan would be leaving the administration to accept the position of President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York. \"One of the best personnel decisions I have made as President was to appoint Mark Gearan as the Director of the Peace Corps,\" Clinton said. \"I believe he has been one of the most successful Directors since President Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961. He has rejuvenated the Peace Corps, and demonstrated a deep commitment to its legacy of service and the women and men who serve as Peace Corps volunteers. He can be proud that the Peace Corps will soon have more volunteers serving overseas than at any time in a generation.\"\n\nGearan explained why he left government to come to Hobart and William Smith. \"College administration generally and, in particular, small, residential, liberal arts colleges have always been things I thought I would like to be a part of, because of their importance, because they are mission-oriented, because they are value-centered,\" Gearan said. \"I came up here and was enormously impressed with the students and their capacity and their love for the place and their yearning for learning,\" Gearan added. Under Gearan's leadership, Hobart and William Smith expanded its academic reach and advanced its reputation as a prominent liberal arts institution. By strengthening the Colleges' financial resources and increasing its fundraising range, Hobart and William Smith transformed the physical campus, adding and expanding facilities while also increasing access and opportunity for students with an expansion of financial aid. Gearan made significant commitments to diversity and inclusion, propelled the Colleges' environmental efforts, and grew programming in civic engagement, career services, leadership, study abroad and student services.\n\nThe President's Forum\n\nGearan established a lecture series, the President's Forum, to bring national and international speakers to the University. Making use of personal contacts made during his thirty years in politics, speakers in the series have included Hillary Clinton, Robert Drinan, Sam Donaldson, Ralph Nader, Donna Shalala, Michael Dukakis, George Stephanopoulos, Barney Frank, George McGovern, Gloria Steinem, and Helen Thomas. \"These speakers will enrich the campus life, while at the same time giving our visiting speakers a better sense of the dynamic community we have here,\" said Gearan, at the time of the series' creation.\n\nStrategic Planning\n\nAt the close of his first year at Hobart and William Smith, Gearan began the development of a five-year strategic planning initiative called HWS 2005. He subsequently led the next two phases, HWS 2010 and HWS 2015, as well as Campaign for the Colleges, which raised more than $205 million to support facilities, endowment and annual giving.\n\nCommitment to Academics\n\nDuring Gearan's tenure and under the mentorship of faculty, HWS students earned numerous prestigious scholarships and fellowships, including:\n\nAccreditation from Middle States Commission\n\nIn 2014, the Colleges received an outstanding accreditation report from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education indicating that HWS fulfilled all standards and characteristics of excellence. Since the last Middle States reaccreditation, the team reported, Hobart and William Smith \"have enhanced academic quality, expanded the faculty, improved campus resources and facilities, strengthened its competitive position, completed a successful $205 million campaign, contributed creatively to Geneva, developed signature programs in co-curricular learning, and nurtured its tradition and engagement of alums – all while weathering extremely well the national financial difficulties of the past six years,\" the report states.\n\nFinancial Health and Fundraising\nFacilities\n\nDuring Gearan's tenure, more than 80 significant capital projects were completed including the construction of six new buildings:\n\nGearan Center for Performing Arts\n\nIn January 2016, the Colleges celebrated the grand opening of the Gearan Center, an extraordinary 65,000-square-foot facility that brings together music, dance, theatre and media and society in a unified academic space for the first time. Made possible thanks to the generosity of countless alumni, alumnae and friends of the Colleges, the facility is the largest capital project in the history of HWS. The Board of Trustees unanimously voted to name the building in honor of Mark D. and Mary Herlihy Gearan.\n\nGeneva, N.Y. and Civic Engagement\n\nA national expert on the intersection of higher education and service, Gearan made Geneva and civic engagement a priority of his presidency. Over the course of 18 years, the Colleges' Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning became a leader in the field promoting positive community change and enhanced student learning.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nEnvironmental sustainability was a core value under Gearan's leadership. In 2007, Gearan signed the American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment, making HWS a charter member of a national effort to reduce emissions of the gases responsible for global warming. Since then, the Colleges have completed several comprehensive greenhouse gas inventories, cut energy consumption by more than 10%, and created robust recycling and composting programs. Today, 100% of the Colleges' electricity comes from wind.\n\nThe Salisbury Center for Career, Professional and Experiential Education\n\nGuidebooks and National Attention During Gearan's Tenure\n\nA July 13, 2014 \"New York Times\" article detailed a case in which a Hobart and William Smith freshman reported a sexual assault by three students two weeks into her first year. As president of HWS, Gearan issued a response on July 13, 2014, stating that \"even though we believe we handled the circumstances fairly and within the constraints of the law, and that we made decisions based on the evidence, there is no sense of satisfaction other than the knowledge that we treated everyone with compassion, kindness and respect.\" He went on to state that \"HWS officials met with the Times reporter for two lengthy interviews and answered numerous questions via e-mail and phone, all in an effort to fully explain our approach and philosophy regarding sexual assault cases\" and stated that \"information that was provided to the Times reporter [was] largely missing from the article\" and that transcripts of the hearings \"were quoted out of context\".\n\nOn July 16, 2014, he issued a second response stating that \"A group of faculty, staff, students and alums are working on a thorough review of our processes for sexual misconduct cases\". In 2015, the Colleges significantly expanded its Office for Title IX Programs and Compliance. The office now includes a Title IX coordinator, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, and a Prevention and Education Coordinator, increasing its outreach to students and facilitating the timely resolution of cases.\n\nGearan is the recipient of 12 honorary degrees. Gearan serves on the boards of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Points of Light Foundation, the Annapolis Group, the Corporation for National and Community Service and The Partnership of Public Service.\n\nOn April 28, 2003 the \"Washington Post\" reported that Gearan's re-appointment to the board of the Corporation for National and Community Service had been kicked back by the Bush White House. On November 23, 2004, Gearan was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve on the board of the Corporation for National and Community Service. On November 30, 2007 the \"Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\" reported that Gearan was confirmed on November 16 to another three-year term on the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service.\n\nAn article by the Associated Press on September 17, 2004, said that in the event of a Kerry win in the 2004 campaign for the presidency, Gearan would be a possible nominee for the post of Secretary of the Interior.\n\n"}

The \"Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\" (IRPR) specify how provisions of \"IRPA\" are to be applied. The \"Act\" would also sprout controversy regarding the government's failure to implement a component of the legislation that would have establish a Refugee Appeal Division as part of Canada's immigration system.\n\nThe Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, who oversees agencies such as CBSA, is responsible for administrating the \"Act\" as it relates to examinations at ports of entry (POEs); enforcement, including arrests, detentions, removals, and policy establishment; and inadmissibility on the grounds of security, organized criminality, or violation of international rights (incl. human rights).

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1927. Hamelin's paternal grandfather, Salomon Hamelin, served in the Legislative Council of Manitoba from 1871 to 1876. His maternal grandfather was legislator Pascal Breland.\n\nHamelin was born in St. Vital, Manitoba (now part of Winnipeg), the son of Firmin Hamelin and Clemence Breland, and was educated in St. Boniface and at the Juniorate of the Sacred Heart in Ottawa, Ontario. He then returned to Manitoba and worked as a merchant, becoming manager of the Joseph Hamelin Co. general store in Ste. Rose du Lac in 1912. He served as reeve of Ste. Rose from 1900 to 1916.\n\nHamelin was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election. Running for the Conservative Party in Ste. Rose, he defeated Liberal candidate J.A. Campbell by sixty votes. After the election, he served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government.\n\nHamelin's time on the government benches was brief. The Roblin government was forced to resign amid scandal in early 1915, and was resoundingly defeated in the 1915 provincial election. Hamelin was one of only five Conservatives to win re-election, defeating Liberal candidate Z.H. Rheaume by twenty-nine votes. Hamelin was the last member to speak against the bill granting women the vote in Manitoba in 1916. In the end, he voted in support of the bill, making its passage unanimous. He was again returned in the 1920 election, in which the Conservatives won eight seats out of fifty-five.\n\nIn the 1922 election, Hamelin won re-election over United Farmers of Manitoba candidate Thomas McDonald by ninety votes. He identified himself as an independent candidate during this campaign, although most political observers considered him to be a Conservative in all but name. He appears to have rejoined the Conservative caucus during the parliament that followed. In the 1927 election, he lost the Ste. Rose constituency to Progressive candidate Maurice Dane MacCarthy by 224 votes.\n\nHamelin attempted to return to the legislature in the 1936 election, but lost to Liberal-Progressive candidate Sauveur Marcoux by 830 votes in the La Verendrye constituency.\n\nIn 1900 at Laurier, Manitoba, he married Parmélie Gamache. They had 10 children. Hamelin died in Niagara Falls, Ontario on August 29, 1947.\n"}

In the episode, Cartman comes across a truckload of fetuses he cannot sell thanks to a recent government ruling on stem cell research. When Kenny is diagnosed with a terminal illness, Cartman uses it to lobby Congress to restore stem cell research.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA in the United States, except on syndicated broadcasts, where the episode is instead rated TV-14. The gag of Kenny dying in almost every episode was dropped after this episode, and he did not reappear bodily until \"Red Sleigh Down\". This was the final appearance of the \"4th Grade\" title sequence which was first seen in \"4th Grade\". On the DVD commentary for the episode, Parker and Stone state that they had originally planned to kill Kyle off for a year, but decided to kill Kenny instead as they were running out of original ways to kill him.\n\nThe episode begins in an abortion clinic with a woman giving her permission for doctors to use her aborted fetus for stem cell research. However, the truck transporting the fetuses to a medical research facility is destroyed in an accident. Its cargo is noticed and subsequently stolen by Cartman (riding his bike and singing Sheena Easton's \"Morning Train\"), who intends to resell the fetuses for a tremendous profit. This goal leads him to call various institutions in the style of a fast-talking agent, with the famous recurring line \"you're breaking my balls here\", finally landing a deal with a government organization. To his dismay, the government puts a ban on stem cell research immediately afterward.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenny is diagnosed with what is presumably muscular dystrophy, and his friends and family are told that he will probably die. The boys are shocked and saddened by the news, but do everything they can to support him and keep him company during his stay in the hospital – all but Stan, who cannot bear to see Kenny dying and refuses to visit him. This marks one of the few episodes in which Kenny's friends mourn his death. Cartman, in the meantime, has a doctor explain to him how stem cells actually work, and learns that they might be used to help Kenny. Cartman also mentions using stem cells to duplicate a Shakey's Pizza restaurant, although the researcher advises him that lumber would be better suited for that task. Cartman gives a speech to the House of Representatives on behalf of stem cell research. He ultimately succeeds in getting the ban lifted by singing \"Heat of the Moment\" by Asia, and begins visiting laboratories around the area to collect more fetuses.\n\nStan, with the supporting words of Chef, finally gets up the courage to come visit Kenny in the hospital. Unfortunately, Kenny has died from the disease. On hearing that Kenny's last words were \"Where's Stan?\" he accuses himself of being Kenny's worst friend. During the funeral, Cartman bursts in and exclaims that a miracle has occurred. He drags Stan and Kyle away to show them how he has manipulated the stem cells from his aborted fetuses into building his very own Shakey's Pizza. Kyle realizes that Cartman had pretended to take Kenny's illness seriously in order to get the ban on stem cells lifted just so he could make a profit off them, therefore allowing him to make his own Shakey's Pizza. Kyle proceeds to beat Cartman up, while Stan is relieved that Cartman was Kenny's worst friend instead of him.\n\nSerene Dominic of the \"Detroit Metro Times\" called the scene from the episode where Cartman leads members of the United States Congress in a sing-along of \"Heat of the Moment\" as the \"Greatest Cartoon Moment\" in the career of the original four members of Asia. In an article for \"ESPN.com\" Tim Kavanagh discussed stem cells and how they were used in the episode, writing: \"This, as with many other important topics of our day, I learned from \"South Park,\" specifically Episode 513, entitled 'Kenny Dies.'\" In a review of the \"South Park\" season 5 DVD release, Choire Sicha of \"The New York Times\" gave a \"not-so-surprising surprise ending alert\" that \"Kenny finally really dies\" at the end of the episode. Alessandra Stanley of \"The New York Times\" cited the episode when noting that the political commentary on \"South Park,\" like \"The Simpsons\" and \"Freak Show\", was genuinely \"provocative\" satire, unlike the \"safer ... mainstream iconoclasm\" of \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\n\"Kenny Dies\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n\n"}

A. Bowles (1865–1954) in a letter to his friend Oliver Wyatt, another keen collector of bulbs, whom he addressed as \"Dear Galanthophil\". Wyatt may have been the first to whom the term was applied, but he was by no means the first galanthophile. Apart from Bowles himself, there had been keen snowdrop collectors since at least the mid-19th century. Many galanthophiles are commemorated in names of snowdrop species or cultivars. Nurseryman James Atkins (1804–1884) of Northampton was one of the earliest so honored, and the tall, early-flowering, robust \"Galanthus\" 'Atkinsii' is still widely grown, having been distributed widely by Canon Ellacombe of Bitton.\n\nJames Allen (1832–1906) of Shepton Mallet was probably the first to raise hybrid snowdrops from deliberate crosses of seed. He claimed in 1891 that he grew every known species of \"Galanthus\" and had raised over 100 distinct seedlings, but much of his collection was lost to botrytis and narcissus fly soon afterward. At least two of his cultivars, \"G.\" 'Magnet' and \"G.\" 'Merlin', survive and are widely grown by collectors. He also raised hybrids which he called \"G.\" 'Galatea' and \"G.\" 'Robin Hood', but the plants now grown under those names may not be the same as those he selected. \"Galanthus\" x \"allenii\" is a hybrid of unknown origin that appeared in a batch of \"G. latifolius\" (now \"G. platyphyllus\"), which Allen received from an Austrian supplier in 1883. (According to Bishop \"et al.\", it is more likely that the bulbs were another broad-leaved species, \"G. woronowii\", often confused with \"G. platyphyllus\".) The bulbs were probably collected in the Caucasus, but \"G. × allenii\" has never been found in the wild since, so that no one can do more than speculate on where the cross occurred and what other species may have been involved. It is a handsome plant with broad, greenish-grey foliage and fairly large flowers, which smell of bitter almonds.\n\nMargery Fish at East Lambrook Manor, Somerset, was another enthusiast and popularizer of \"Galanthus nivalis\" and its varieties in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nNotable modern galanthophiles include the late Primrose Warburg (1920–1996), after whom \"G.\" 'Primrose Warburg' is named: appropriately, it has yellow markings and a yellow ovary. (Primrose ovaries are generally green.) She was married to the noted botanist E. F. Warburg. Several other fine snowdrops originated at her garden at South Hayes in Oxfordshire, including the unusual cultivar named \"G.\" 'South Hayes' which has strong green markings on the outer tepals of the flower.\n\nBotanist Aaron Davis and gardeners Matt Bishop and John Grimshaw, authors of the works on which these notes are based, also qualify as galanthophiles.\n\n\n"}

It merged with Arnold School, Blackpool, in 2012 to form AKS Lytham.\n\nThe Lytham Schools Foundation was established in 1719 after a flood disaster in the town. In 1908, one hundred and eighty-nine years after the Foundation's initial formation, King Edward VII School was opened to provide an education for local boys. The opening of the girls' Queen Mary School followed in 1930.\n\nIt had a reputation of excellence in sports and a thriving history of drama productions and had links with the Czech Republic, France and Germany, with which exchange trips were frequently held (and still are by AKS Lytham).\n\nThe Board of Governors announced that King Edward VII and Queen Mary School would be merging with Arnold School, another fee-paying school in the North-West, in September 2012. This happened without consultation inclusive of parents, pupils or staff. A parent group opposed to the takeover submitted objections to the Charity Commission which prompted a review prior to allowing the merger to proceed. The Charity Commission completed their report and announced on 11 November 2011 that they had approved the new scheme. The parent group immediately announced their intention to appeal against the Charity Commission decision. The appeal was lodged with HM Courts and Tribunal Service – First Tier Tribunal on Friday 9 December 2011. The tribunal's decision was made on 17 May 2012 and stated that the merger could proceed, however the lease agreement put the charity assets at undue risk and needed to be re-written. The parents group then announced that they were not going to appeal and the merger therefore proceeded.\n\nIn 2011 Fylde M.P. Mark Menzies became involved in the heated controversy surrounding the proposed take-over of the school by the United Church Schools Trust and its merger with Arnold School.\n\nKing Edward School's motto was 'Sublimis Ab Unda', which is Latin for 'raised from the waves', in reference to the fact the school was funded by the aforementioned flood disaster. Queen Mary School's motto was 'Semper Fidelis, Semper Parata', which translates as 'Always Faithful, Always Prepared'. The two former schools each had a coat of arms, but despite the two schools being separate they shared the same governing body, which itself had a coat of arms, that consisted of the two schools' coats of arms impaled. This coat of arms was used for the combined school since the merger in 1999. The uniforms for both boys and girls were also changed at this time. As of 2008, a new rebrand of the KEQMS brand was launched. A new logo was produced, and the motto was changed to 'Inspiring Personal Excellence'\n\nAfter a reduction in student numbers following New Labour's abolition of the Assisted Places Scheme in 1997, the two single-sex schools merged. Now fully co-educational and housed in and around the old King Edward VII building, it consisted of a Kindergarten, Infant, Junior and Senior School, plus a Sixth Form, which was situated on the first floor of the House, and in the old Lecture Theatre. The Queen Mary site was sold in order to raise money for the continuing development of the new school, and is now housing.\n\nNotable former pupils (Lidunians) include:\n"}

It originally aired on December 11, 2002.\n\nIn the episode, Cartman has to score one big \"nice\" on Santa's list to be eligible for Christmas presents. He recruits Santa, Mr. Hankey, and Jesus in a desperate attempt to bring Christmas to the downtrodden citizens of Iraq. Things go awry and when Santa is shot down in Iraq, Jesus comes to his aide.\n\nThe episode is notable for the return of Kenny from his death in season five. The title and episode parody the films \"Black Hawk Down\" and \"Three Kings\".\n\nCartman has Kyle's cousin perform a tally of his naughty and nice deeds. He informs Cartman that he has been too naughty to earn his coveted Christmas gift, a Haibo robot dog. In order to reverse his past misdeeds, he sets out to spread Christmas cheer to the people of Iraq. Meanwhile, at a tree lighting ceremony, Jimmy is given the honor of lighting, but first decides to sing \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". Due to his stutter, it takes most of the episode for him to reach the end of the twelve verses.\n\nWith the use of Mr. Hankey's Poo-Choo train, Cartman and the other boys travel to the North Pole to convince Santa Claus to bring Christmas to Iraq. With the assistance of the Underpants Gnomes, Santa prepares his sleigh and travels to Iraq, only to be promptly shot down, brought in, and tortured. The boys realize that Cartman's little ploy may have ended Christmas for everyone and set out to make things right.\n\nTaking a backup sled, they seek out Jesus. Upon hearing the news, Jesus promptly arms himself with an array of automatic weapons and travels with the boys to Iraq, brutally gunning down everyone who impedes him. The group breaks into the interrogation room and frees Santa.\n\nAs they make their way back to the sleigh, Jesus is shot dead by one Iraqi captor. Outraged, Santa kills the soldier, and proceeds to blast his way out. Back on the sleigh, Santa flies the children back to South Park, but not before covering Iraq in Christmas decorations.\n\nMuch to the town's delight, Jimmy finally finishes his song and switches on the Christmas tree, only for the lights to then blow a fuse. At that moment though, Santa flies past the tree and magically restores them.\n\nSanta returns the boys home, hoping that people will always remember Jesus on this day. He gives the children all Haibo dogs as thanks, but Cartman is disgusted, as he wanted to be the only kid owning one and have his friends envy him. Kenny then shows up out of nowhere (his first appearance since \"Kenny Dies\"), though the three seem unfazed by this.\n\nThis episode came from the idea of \"Black Hawk Down\" with Santa Claus. The creators had always planned to bring Kenny back in the last episode, but they killed off Jesus (who dies to save Santa) the idea being that's why at Christmas time we think about Jesus.\n\nSanta's house in the North Pole is Superman's Fortress of Solitude from \"Superman II\".\n\n\"Red Sleigh Down\", along with the sixteen other episodes from \"South Park\"'s sixth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005.

The game is notable for its heavily stylized cinema-inspired action as well as its sound quality and focus on destructive effects during gameplay.\n\n\"Black\" takes place in Ingushetia and Chechnya, Russia. The protagonist is a black ops operative named Sergeant First Class Jack Kellar (portrayed by Marty Papazian). Kellar tells most of the story in first-person at an interrogation four days after the events in the story begin.\n\nKellar is an inadequately disciplined member of a CIA black ops unit and a veteran of several conflicts including Guatemala, Colombia, Iran and Croatia. The unknown interrogator (portrayed by Paul Pape) questions Kellar about an arms smuggling and terrorist operation called the \"Seventh Wave\" who have been responsible for a number of terrorist attacks. Kellar is told that, unless he co-operates, he and his actions will be declassified, meaning he will be convicted at court-martial, dishonorably discharged, and imprisoned for life. Though initially resistant, Kellar at last agrees to tell his story.\n\nFour days earlier, Kellar and his military unit were attacking a Seventh Wave stronghold in the city of Veblensk. Kellar kills three high-ranking members of the cell but then disobeys orders by rushing inside a terrorist controlled building, where a terrorist ambushes him. However, the man did not kill Kellar, who learned that his captor is an American, William Lennox, a former CIA wetworks operative. After faking his own death in Cairo, Lennox has apparently become the leader of Seventh Wave.\n\nKellar's next mission is to cross the border into Treneska and traverse the Vlodnik Canal, destroy a base and weapons cache, then meet a female black ops soldier named MacCarver (voiced by Cree Summer), the commander of black ops Team Bravo, at a farmhouse. Things do not go as planned; however, Kellar defends and clears the farmhouse and later meets MacCarver.\n\nKellar and MacCarver begin a mission to destroy an arms factory in the city of Naszran. To safely complete the mission they must navigate an old graveyard and town, both heavily defended. After doing so, they assault the town's iron foundry, destroying its productive capacity. The two black operatives then meet a third member of the team, Solomon.\n\nWith the information regarding the position of Valencio, one of the four bosses of Seventh Wave, is hiding in Tivliz Asylum. The team decide to attack the asylum yard with Keller rushed into the asylum despite Solomon protested that their order was to hold. Keller found Valencio after blowing up a concrete machine gun nest and briefly interrogated Valencio for Lennox's location by electrocution and threatened to hurt his wife and children. \n\nBased on information gathered from the mission, Team Bravo has proceeded to a well-defended dockyard, cleared the area and linked up with Alpha Team. Alpha Team, however, is destroyed in an ambush while Lennox escapes seconds beforehand. In light of the disastrous result, the operation is cancelled as well. Despite these events, Kellar leads a retaliatory assault against the Graznei Bridge before leaving his team at the gates of Lennox's compound to successfully penetrate the defenses both around and inside the Spetriniv Gulag. During the attack, Keller triggers an explosion resulting from the destruction of two concrete barricades, and subsequent explosions in the final room of the underground bunker, presumably killing Lennox.\n\nThe interrogator then reveals to Kellar that authorities had, in fact, always known of Lennox's involvement in Seventh Wave. Kellar had acted predictably, doing what his profile said he would, while his pursuit of Lennox was both expected and welcome, but Lennox is not yet dead. Kellar is told that a false \"death\" in a car accident has been arranged for him to provide cover so he could continue his pursuit. The game ends with Kellar being told to get ready for his next assignment.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially a straightforward first person shooter. Players can only carry two weapons at a time; therefore, strategy is needed when choosing weaponry, with weapons differing in characteristics. The player can also carry grenades, which can be thrown without switching weapons. Land mines and grenades can be detonated prematurely by shooting them.\n\nThe game is mission-based, with each mission separated by a cut scene video. On harder difficulties, there are more objectives that must be completed before the player can progress. These extra objectives involved collecting various intelligence documents, blueprints, or destroying parts of the environment. These are all indicated by the HUD cross-hair changing color when the player points at the relevant object.\n\nSuccessful completion of the objectives over all missions in all difficulties above 'Easy' results in the awarding of Silver Weapons (infinite bullets) and unlocking the M16-A2 (40mm underslung grenade launcher attachment) as the starting default weapon with infinite 40mm grenades. When unlocked, these features are permanent and cannot be removed without starting a fresh storyline.\n\nCriterion intended to \"do for shooting what \"Burnout\" did for racing - tear it apart\", with dual emphasis on destructible environments and the handling and behavior of real-world firearms. Bullets that hit buildings, terrain and objects leave visible damage; moreover, the guns are rendered with great detail and accuracy, though some weapons' features are stylized or exaggerated. The emphasis on the appearance, function, and sounds of the weapons led the developer to label the game as \"Gun-Porn.\" Another notable and original feature is the use of real-time blur while reloading, giving a depth of field and more perspective to the game. Similarly, when the player drops below two bars of health, the screen turns black and white, the sound of the character's heartbeat become the dominant noise and the game goes into slow motion, and the large and small motors in the control pads match the sound of systolic and diastolic part of the heartbeat.\n\nThe game was not developed with an overarching plot structure in mind and this was implemented as something of an afterthought towards the end of development. The initial idea for relating the plot in-game came from Black's director, Alex Ward, who wanted to have a radio-play-style voiceover spoken over a 'black' screen.\n\nEmphasising the game's action film heritage, sound effects for the weapons in the game were based on various sounds from films. For example, Bruce Willis' Heckler & Koch MP5 in \"Die Hard\", Jack Bauer's pistol in \"24\", and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Uzi in \"True Lies\".\n\nRealising in the chaos of a heavy gun battle the heavy mix of sound and music would produce a cacophony of noise, the sound designers developed the \"choir of guns\" concept. Whereas, traditionally in a shooter game, each weapon model would be assigned a different sound, \"Black\" assigns each enemy their own \"voice\", similar to the way in which each member of a choir would have their own distinct voice. For example, there are three enemies firing, one would be assigned a low voice, another a medium voice, and the third a high voice. This allows all the weapons being fired in any particular scene to harmonise and deliver a distinct sound for the game.\n\"Black\"s sound was nominated for Best Audio at the 2006 BAFTA Video Games Awards, and won Best Art & Sound jointly with \"Burnout Revenge\" at the 2006 Develop Industry Excellence Awards.\n\nThe music for \"Black\" was composed by Chris Tilton, using a theme co-authored with Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino. It was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage.\n\n\"Black\"s PlayStation 2 version received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Black\" received \"favorable\" reviews on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nIn Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PS2 version all four eights, for a total of 32 out of 40. \"The Times\" also gave the game four stars out of five and stated, \"As the entire game is played at fever-pitch, you soon find yourself looking forward to the next mission briefing, if only for a chance to catch your breath. The only mystery to \"Black\" is why there is no multiplayer mode, since such intense battle settings would make for great competitive bouts.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" similarly gave it four stars out of five, saying, \"Little strategy is required for each stage, with abundant health packs and aggressive opponents of little intelligence. But there are many strategies and the use of cover is vital.\" \"Detroit Free Press\" gave the Xbox version three stars out of four and said, \"The action is intense and the effects are splendid, though the un-reality applies also to the worlds in which you battle.\" However, \"The A.V. Club\" gave the game a C+, stating that it was worth playing for \"Six hours. Pretty good hours, but still, \"The A.V. Club\" can't stress that number enough\"; and added that \"That was awesome for \"Doom\", a free download with 16 extra maps available after registration. But 40 bucks for \"Black\"s eight levels, with no multiplayer mode, and unlockable difficulty settings the only incentive to replay? The question is really whether renting this lovely oversized tech demo is worth a whole weekend.\"\n\nIn 2013, IGN listed the game at 99 in the list of \"Top 100 Shooters\".\n\nIn an interview, co-creator and designer Stuart Black revealed that plans for \"Black 2\" were underway, but are now scrapped due to differences with Electronic Arts. Stuart Black and many of the developers of \"Black\" worked on the now released \"Bodycount\"; a spiritual successor to the game which, developed by Codemasters, was released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 during Q3 2011.\n\n"}

It was originally published in \"The New Yorker\", as were some of the other short stories that would later be reprinted in the 1960 collection \"Kiss Kiss\".\n\nMr and Mrs Foster are a mature, wealthy married couple living in New York. Mrs Foster has recently begun to suspect her husband of purposely exacerbating her pathological fear of missing a train or plane. She is continuously badgered by her husband, Eugene, who makes a habit of waiting to leave the house until after the proverbial last second has already passed.\n\nMrs Foster is preparing for a six-week trip to Paris (after weeks of persuading her husband to let her go), where their daughter and her family (including three grandchildren that she has never yet met) reside. After letting his wife wait anxiously for some time, Mr Foster finally gets into the car with her. As they are driven to the airport, Mrs Foster finds that despite being far behind schedule, her flight is temporarily postponed until the next day due to a thick fog. Mrs Foster decides to get a room near the airport for the night, but her husband insists that she come home.\n\nThe next day while attempting to leave for the airport without her husband, things finally come to a head. After the usual rounds of teasing his wife's delicate psyche, and demanding that he be driven to his club (which is in the opposite direction of the airport and therefore complicating the journey to the airport even more), Mr Foster tries to foil his wife for the last time by claiming he has mistakenly left a present for their daughter in the house. Mr Foster insists on looking for the gift himself and goes back inside. While her husband pretends to search their six-story home, Mrs Foster finds the present down the side of one of the car seats and can't help but notice \"it was wedged down firm and deep, as though with the help of a pushing hand\". Mrs Foster rushes to retrieve her husband as quickly as possible, but hears a series of unspecified noises from inside their home and has a sudden change of heart. Mrs Foster gets back in the car and much to the surprise of the driver, demands to be driven to the airport immediately, stating that her husband will understand and will get a cab to the club instead.\n\nMrs Foster enjoys her time in Paris, meets and gets to know her grandchildren and writes her husband weekly, as promised.\n\nThe visit concludes, and Mrs Foster flies back to New York. Upon her arrival at the airport, Mrs Foster notes that her husband has not sent a car to meet her. After arriving at home, she enters and notices a large pile of mail under the letterbox, as well as a strange smell. She does a quick lap around the first floor and, seemingly satisfied, calls the elevator company to report the home's apparently broken lift. The story closes with Mrs Foster waiting for the arrival of the lift repair man.\n\nThe implication is that despite her meek and subservient behaviour for the last 30 years, Mrs Foster was finally pushed to the point of purposely leaving her husband trapped in a broken elevator (explained by the faint noises she heard behind the front door), inside their empty home, for six weeks, and that this led to his death.\n\n\"The Way Up to Heaven\" was dramatized in a 1958 episode of Alfred Hitchcock's television show\n\"Suspicion\" (Season 1, Episode 29), and subsequently in a 1979 episode of \"Tales of the Unexpected\" (Season 1, Episode 9).\n"}

For these types of applications, Good's buffers are recommended.\n\nThere are many different ways to prepare PBS solutions (one of them is Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), which has a lower phosphate concentration than standard PBS). Some formulations do not contain potassium and magnesium, while other ones contain calcium and/or magnesium (depending on whether or not the buffer is used on live or fixed tissue: the latter does not require KCl or MgCl ).\nStart with 800 mL of distilled water to dissolve all salts. Add distilled water to a total volume of 1 liter. The resultant 1× PBS will have a final concentration of 157 mM Na, 140mM Cl, 4.45mM K, 10.1 mM HPO, 1.76 mM HPO and a pH of 7.96. Add 2.84mM of HCl to shift the buffer to 7.3 mM HPO and 4.6 mM HPO for a final pH of 7.4 and a Cl concentration of 142 mM.\nThe pH of PBS is ~7.4. When making buffer solutions, it is good practice to always measure the pH directly using a pH meter. If necessary, pH can be adjusted using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.\n\nPBS can also be prepared by using commercially made PBS buffer tablets or pouches.\n\nIf used in cell culturing, the solution can be dispensed into aliquots and sterilized by autoclaving or filtration. Sterilization may not be necessary depending on its use. PBS can be stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. However, concentrated stock solutions may precipitate when cooled and should be kept at room temperature until precipitate has completely dissolved before use.\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the greatest original thinkers of the Brahmo Samaj and did work in comparative religion and on the philosophy of science. He systematised the humanism of the Brahmo philosophical thought. In his work, he underscored the tectonic shift in Brahmo theology in the late nineteenth century from liberal theism to secular humanism. Like his better known ideological precursor Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Seal was an educator, a firm believer in the cause of rationalism and scientific enquiry, a polymath in his own right and yet at the same time a preacher of humanism as a religious doctrine (as opposed to organised religion).\n\nHe was born in Haripal, Hoogly District (in West Bengal), in 1864. His father Mohendranath Seal was one of the earliest followers of Comtean positivism in Bengal. As a student of philosophy at the General Assembly's Institution (now Scottish Church College, Calcutta), he became attracted to Brahmo theology. And along with his better-known classmate and friend Narendranath Dutta, the future Swami Vivekananda, he regularly attended meetings of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. Later they would part ways with Dutta aligning himself with Keshub Chunder Sen's New Dispensation (and later on to found his own religious movement, the Ramakrishna Mission) and Seal staying on as an initiated member. During this time spent together, both Seal and Dutta sought to understand the intricacies of faith, progress and spiritual insight in the works of John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer and G.W.F. Hegel. Seal had a natural aptitude for mathematics and logic.\n\nHe earned his M.A. degree in philosophy from the University of Calcutta in 1884 and started out as a lecturer at the City College, Calcutta.\n\nSeal had four daughters and three sons, including the writer Sarajubala Sen. His grandson was the film director Mrinal Sen.\n\nAlthough he had started out as a college lecturer, his deep insatiable thirst for knowledge, coupled with financial constraints made him shift from one college to another (the colleges where Seal taught include Morris College, Nagpur, and Krishnath College, Berhampur). During the time period 1883 to 1907, he composed his first major work \"New Essays in Criticism\", in which he applied Hegelian dialectics to literary criticism. Although he was an ardent admirer of English Romanticism, and Romantic literature in particular, his work reveals him to be an early precursor of the school of logical positivism. In 1915, he earned his doctorate from the University of Calcutta on the subject of \"The Positive Sciences of the Ancient Hindus\".\n\nIn 1896, Maharaja Nripendra Narayan Bhupa Bahadur, the son-in-law of Keshub Chunder Sen offered him the post of a principal of the newly established Victoria College in Cooch Behar. With a certain level of financial security assured, Seal finished his \"New Essays in Criticism\" and also composed an epic poem called \"Quest Eternal\" that traced his intellectual and philosophical odyssey. His further studies on ancient Hindu scientific philosophy led him to contribute a chapter in Prafulla Chandra Roy's \"History of Chemistry in Ancient India\". His publications were noticed abroad and in 1902, his candidacy was seriously considered for a professorship in philosophy at the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe financial support provided by the Maharaja helped Seal to visit Europe in 1899, 1906 and 1911. In 1906, Seal addressed the International Congress of Orientalists in Rome and in 1911, the First Universal Race Congress in London. In 1911, while in London, the sudden death of his patron, the Maharaja, and subsequent withdrawal of financial support for his cultural and comparative-historical studies forced him to quit his job and reconsider his philosophical beliefs. During this phase, he underwent a transformation from being a believer of Brahmo rationalist doctrine to being a spiritual humanist. His analysis on the \"Comparative Studies in Vaishnavism and Christianity\" (1912) expresses the urge to break free from the hegemony of method as applicable in Eurocentric academic enquiry (as in disciplines like Indology and anthropology) and instead focus on comparative methodology, that would be largely immune to any possible colonialist bias. In this, Seal was motivated not merely as a recipient of orientalist hegemony in the academia, or as a counter cultural or for that matter, as a cultural nationalist response to imperialist discourse, as he was due so a more profound love for rationalist spirit of enquiry, albeit in a colonial context. For he was a rational humanist first, and a cultural nationalist much later.\n\nAfter his resignation from Victoria College, he was offered the most prestigious chair of philosophy in India, the King George V professorship of philosophy at the University of Calcutta (other holders of this chair include Professor Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan among others). He used this period (1913–1921) to travel extensively, give lectures, publish books and philosophical tracts and support the efforts of Vice-Chancellor Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee to make the University of Calcutta one of the best known seats of learning to the east of Suez. His scholarly contribution was recognised again with the award of an Honorary doctorate (Doctor of Science) from the University of Calcutta, on 17 December 1921.\n\nHe helped Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in founding the Visva-Bharati University on 22 December 1921. By virtue of being India's leading scholar on philosophy and comparative-historical studies and its first Western visiting scholar, Seal was honoured as the first Chancellor of that university. During the same time, he was also appointed the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, a position he held till 1930, when ill health forced him to retire. In 1926, the government of British India knighted him. During his stay in Mysore, he authored a textbook of Indian philosophy and a biography of Raja Rammohun Roy.\n\nAfter retirement, and notwithstanding his general physical deterioration and failing eyesight, he achieved the grand finale of his long philosophical journey. In 1936, when he was bedridden and blind, he finished his magnum opus called \"Quest Eternal\", which is one of the few modern Indian epics on the theme of the Faustian man in search of the reason for human existence. The conditions in which he wrote parallels that of the English poet John Milton when he wrote his Paradise Lost. The Faustian urge of this brilliant mind to find the meaning of life is at once an existential quest as a Modernist one. Although Seal was writing as a subject of the imperialist enterprise, and not as a party to it, it could be argued that he was a Modernist and an existentialist without his knowing it.\n\nAlthough he was initially inspired by the Hegelian philosophy of the unilinearlity of history, one that resonated well with the official Sadharan Brahmo Samaj doctrine, Seal eventually rejected the Hegelian thesis of the linear flow of historical progress from East to West as being too narrow and parochial. The logical culmination of the Hegelian idea envisioned all human races as being surrogates and appendages to the dominant Greco-Roman-Gothic type, which in its wake resonated perfectly well with the Orientalist doctrine. Seal saw this discourse as being dangerously Eurocentric that in effect precluded the possibility of an equitable cultural dialogue. As he saw it, the philosophy of the subaltern societies or those relegated to the periphery would be seen as being in a state of primitivism when compared to the philosophy of the dominant societies. As he saw it, the Orientalist bias espoused by Hegelianism:\n\nSeal drew close to what is today called postcolonialism. As contrary to colonial discourse, he argued that in any proper comparative-historical analysis, all societies should be seen as being in similar stages in the development of culture. All cultural traditions could be relatively seen as they evolved parallel patterns wherein\n\nAs distinct from the Hegelian world view, Seal espoused that the idea of Western civilisation as being the focal point or the culmination of world civilisation was fundamentally erroneous, that failed to take into account the myriad richness and complex mosaic of cultural continuum that manifested themselves in Hindu, Islamic, and Chinese civilisations. Human civilisation, far from being a centripetal order where the West was to be considered as the centre around which other (non-Western) cultures revolved was for Seal, \nThus, as he saw it (in \"Comparative Studies in Vaishnavism and Christianity\"), Vaishnavism and Christianity were two distinct religious traditions, each with its own uniquely rich tradition of historical exegesis that spanned two millennia and could in no way be seen as being phases in the development of (a Eurocentric) human civilisation, as one leading to another in a pattern of cause and effect. Seal's philosophical insights were to be developed by his latter day successor from his college A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the ISKCON movement.\n\nHis epic poem \"Quest Eternal\" is rich in the application of symbolism of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions. It stands out as a very sophisticated cross-cultural analysis of the dilemma of the modern Everyman in search of meaning in life. For Seal, this search for meaning has two dimensions: firstly, the historical dimension that explores how a world view or a zeitgeist is shaped by the continuum of the ancient, medieval and the modern, and secondly, the cultural dimension which spells out how specific patterns of human configurations shape a world view in the mode of causality. Seal's hero is on an adventure on a scale far more grandiose, magnificent, world-encompassing and demanding than Goethe's Faust. The hero is the prototype of the modern cosmopolitan man in search of an ever-elusive unity in the pluralistic universe:\n<br>\nSeal's hero (in the initial stages) is not merely the man who is trapped within the confines of ancient social order where he is merely a hapless victim of circumstances beyond his control, but the hero who undergoes a spiritual transformation to a medieval wizard knight (who closely resembles the modern scientific man) who seeks out scientific rationalism in nature. He seeks the truth in the \"Magician Commonwealth of Reason\" and eventually wins the ever-elusive trophy of the \"Zodiac shield of the Sun for his victories over Untruth\". However like all well intended adventures, his quest is ultimately Promethean and Sisyphean and must end in failure: \n<br>\nThe modern man of science, much like Dr. Faustus, (and not unlike Christian, an Everyman character) is an eternally homeless wanderer, \"... in search of a Wisdom that is able to master Death\". Death is not merely physical, but a metaphor for \"the dark power in life who frustrates our goals and strivings\" who assists the victory of \"brute Matter and blind Sense\" over \"realms of Soul, of Nature, and of Man in History\". In despair, the hero expostulates:\n<br>\nSeal's hero is not proletarian, and does not take recourse to rationalism, scientism, Marxism or any salvation theology, but a universal redeemer whose task, like Prometheus, is to \"redeem humanity from the bondage of the Gods\":\n<br>\nSeal's epic redeems collective suffering as a means to redeem humanity . His belief in the religion of universal humanity found parallel reflection in Rabindranath Tagore's concept of the \"Vishwa Manav\" or the Universal Man, who would rise from the ashes like a phoenix to redeem the depravities of humanity. And yet like Prometheus, he would be eternally trapped by the vicissitudes of existence.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The attacks left 34 people dead and 171 injured.\n\nThe explosions occurred on the night of 7 October, against the Hilton Taba and campsites used by Israelis in Ras al-Shitan. In the Taba attack, a truck drove into the lobby of the Taba Hilton and exploded, killing 31 people and wounding some 159 others. Ten floors of the hotel collapsed following the blast.\n\nSome south, at campsites at Ras al-Shitan, near Nuweiba, two more bombings happened. A car parked in front of a restaurant at the Moon Island resort exploded, killing two Israelis and a Bedouin. Twelve were wounded. Another blast happened moments later, targeting the Baddiyah camp, but did not harm anyone because the bomber had apparently been scared off from entering the campground by a guard.\n\nOf the 34 who were killed, 18 were Egyptians, 12 were from Israel, two from Italy, one from Russia, and one was an Israeli-American.\n\nAccording to the Egyptian government, the bombers were Palestinians who had tried to enter Israel to carry out attacks there but were unsuccessful. They claimed that the mastermind, Iyad Saleh, recruited Egyptians and Bedouins to find explosives to be used in the attacks. Beginning in March 2004, the bombers used washing machine timers, mobile phones and modified gas cylinders to build the bombs. They used TNT and old explosives found in the Sinai (as it was many times a war zone), which were purchased from Bedouins, to complete the bombs. Egypt has said that Saleh and one of his aides, Suleiman Ahmed Saleh Flayfil, died in the Hilton blast, apparently because their bomb timer had run out too fast.\n\nThree Egyptians, Younes Mohammed Mahmoud, Osama al-Nakhlawi, and Mohammed Jaez Sabbah were sentenced to death in November 2006 for their roles in the blast. Egypt arrested up to 2,400 people following the attacks.\n\nAccording to investigators, there is no strong link to Al Qaeda in the blasts.\n\nIsrael had warned in September 2004 that terrorists were planning attacks in the Sinai, but most Israelis did not heed those warnings and went on vacation there instead. Many Israelis left the Sinai after the bombings, along with some foreign tourists, but the effects on the country's tourism were not too severe.\n\nMilitants struck again in Cairo at tourists in April 2005, killing three and wounding several.

His works focus on the idea, rooted in social constructionism, that the categories with which we describe and define human sexuality are historically and culturally specific, along with the social organization of sexual activity, desire, relationships, and sexual identities.\n\nKatz graduated from The High School of Music & Art in New York City with a major in art in 1956. Since 2004, he has begun to emerge publicly as a visual artist. He went on to study at Antioch College, the City College of New York, The New School, and Hunter College. As a teenager, Katz was featured in \"Life\" magazine for his efforts to create a film version of \"Tom Sawyer\".\n\nKatz taught as an adjunct at Yale University, Eugene Lang College, and New York University, was the convener of a faculty seminar at Princeton University, and was a keynote speaker at Harvard University. He is a founding member of the Gay Academic Union in 1973 and the National Writers Union in 1980.

Since 2012, the site has been co-directed by Katz and John D'Emilio.\n\nKatz received the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Sex Research from the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research in 1997. In 2003, he was given Yale University's Brudner Prize, an annual honor recognizing scholarly contributions in the field of lesbian and gay studies. His papers are collected by the manuscript division of The Research Libraries of The New York Public Library.\n\nHe received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from Publishing Triangle in 1995.\n\nKatz artist practice focused on same-sex and different-sex relationships, and changes in the social construction of sexuality over time. His works stress that the social organization of human sexual activity, desire, relationships, and sexual identities are historically and culturally specific, along with the categories with which we name, describe, define and understand human sexuality.\n\n\"The Invention of Heterosexuality\" was first published as an essay in 1990 and then expanded into a larger book. In it, Katz traces the development of \"heterosexual\" and \"homosexual\" and all the ideology, social and economic relations, gender expectations that were packed into it. He notes the radical change, in the late nineteenth century, from a sexual ethic of procreation to one based on erotic pleasure and sexual object choice. Noting the distinction that a procreation-based ethic condemns all non-procreative sex, categorizing sexual relations based primarily on this point. A gender-based sexual ethic is concerned with procreative sex on a secondary level, if at all.\n\nKatz follows the development of \"heterosexual\" as going through several stages. Coined in 1868 (in German, \"Heterosexualität\") by Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, the term, used to pathologize certain behaviors, initially referred to a person with an overwhelming drive toward the opposite sex and was associated with a number of pathologized behaviors. In 1889, Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing used the term in something like its modern-day sense. The first known use in America was in 1892, by James G. Kiernan. Here, it referred to some combination of bisexuality and a tendency to thwart the then-existing procreation ethic.\n\nKrafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\", published in 1889, and then in English in 1892, marked the clear turning point from a procreation-based sexuality to a pleasure-based ethic which focused on gender to define the normal and the abnormal. Krafft-Ebing did not, however, make a clean break from the old procreative standards. In much of the discourse of the time, the heterosexual was still a deviant figure, since it signified a person unconcerned with the old sexual norms.\n\nFor a variety of economic and social reasons, Katz argues, during the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, this new norm became more firmly established and naturalized, marking out new gender and sexual norms, new social and family arrangements, and new deviants and perverts. One of the important consequences of this line of thought which Katz notes in \"\"Homosexual\" and \"Heterosexual\": Questioning the Terms\", is that we can only generalize sexual identities onto the past with a limited degree of accuracy: \"So profound is the historically specific character of sexual behavior that only with the loosest accuracy can we speak of sodomy in the early colonies and 'sodomy' in present-day New York as 'the same thing.' In another example, to speak of 'heterosexual behavior' as occurring universally is to apply one term to a great variety of activities produced within a great variety of sexual and gender systems.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its eastern border was formed by the bend of the Didessa River, which separated it from (proceeding downstream to upstream) Limmu-Ennarea to the northeast, and the kingdoms of Gomma and Gera to the south. Beyond its northern border were various Macha Oromo groups, and to the west Sidamo groups. Its territory corresponds approximately with the modern woredas of Gechi and Didessa.\n\nThis former kingdom was mostly located on a plateau with an average elevation of 6500 feet, and had a population estimated in 1880 of about 50,000. Its inhabitants had a reputation as warriors. Beckingham and Huntingford considered Gumma, along with Gomma, was the least economically developed of the Gibe kingdoms; however Mohamed Hassen notes that, with the exception of the northern and western boundaries where constant raiding by her neighbors, the Arjo in the north and the Nonno in the west, forced those living in those parts to embrace pastoralism, the land was intensively farmed and grew many of the same crops as the other Gibe kingdoms -- sorghum, wheat, barley and cotton—except for coffee.\n\nThe latest kings of Gumma traced their origin to a man called Adam. Around 1770, he came to live in the area, and is said to have then helped in the deposition of the last king of the previous dynasty, Sarborada. The historian Mohammed Hassen, in discussing this tradition, suggests this tradition about Adam \"was invented so as to Islamize the original founder of the dynasty.\"\n\nKing Jawe was converted to Islam by merchants from Shewa and Begemder, and in turn he imposed his religious faith upon his subjects.\n\nIn 1882, King Abba Jubir of Gumma convinced the kings of Ennerea, Gomma and Jimma to form a confederacy known as the \"Muslim League\", to counter the threat from some of the Macha Oromo, who in turn formed their own alliance, the \"League of the Four Oromo\". At first the Muslim League had little success against this threat, for the other members did not support Abba Jubir against the Macha, until his elder brother Abba Digir was captured. At this point the people of Ennerea came to their help, but even with this help Abba Jubir had no more success and was forced to negotiate an armistice with the Macha for the safe release of his brother. Abba Jubir then went to war against Jimma, and sacked its capital, despite Gomma and Limmu-Enerea coming to the aid of Jimma.\n\nDespite the failure of the Muslim League, Gumma remained a stronghold of Islam, and provided asylum to men exiled from the other Gibe kingdoms.

It is a Gendai Budō martial art in the James Mitose lineage intended to provide for all aspects of self-defense. The Hombu Dojo, or headquarters, is located in Frankfort, Kentucky.\n\nDurbin was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father Richard P Durbin Sr. was a veteran of World War II and his mother Harvie Brown Haynes was bedridden for most of Durbin's childhood due to health issues. Durbin has stated that he decided to dedicate his life to the ministry at the age of fourteen during a baptist revival. After several incidents he began his martial arts studies in Bardstown, Kentucky with instructor Richard Stone, originally learning Kodokan Judo, at the age of sixteen. When he left for college in 1971, he along with Bob Sester (a Shotokan Karate student), and Bos Bosmar (also with the Kodokan) started Campbellsville College Martial Arts Club at Campbellsville University. During his time with the college, Durbin has stated that he studied various other forms of martial arts (while being unable to cite any third party sources) including; Shotokan Karate, Isshin-ryu, Goju Ryu, Shorin-ryu, Aikikai Aikido, Ninjutsu, Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, and T'ai chi ch'uan.\n\nAccording to Durbin, in 1974, while teaching self-defense in Michigan he coined the phrase \"Ki Yang Ju Te\", to reflect his personal teaching philosophy toward the martial arts. Durbin graduated in 1975 from Campbellsville College. In 1978, he (along with Richard Stone) joined with Rod Sacharnoski of Juko Kai and began to study with Bill \"Superfoot\" Wallace, a master of Shorin-ryu Karate and the World Middleweight Full Contact Karate Champion. After joining Juko Kai, Durbin has stated that he demonstrated his martial art skill to Rod Sacharnoski and was granted rank in Juko Kai and started teaching Juko Kai using his personal philosophy.\n\nIn 1980, Durbin was awarded his Shihan ranking from Juko Kai in Kempo. Also in 1980 he experienced what he describes as a \"Tenshin Sho\", a \"divine illumination\" where his perspective on religion and his practice of martial arts changed. Instead of being a minister who practiced martial arts, he now considered himself a \"martial arts minister\". He was encouraged by Sacharnoski to pursue this further and began to develop a curriculum and codify his philosophies and teachings in preparations for opening his own school and founding his own system. He opened his dojo in Frankfort the next year in 1981 under the auspices of Juko Kai.\n\nDurbin has Shihan rank in Kempo, Karate, jujutsu, Aikijujutsu, Kobujutsu and a Sibak rank in T'ai chi ch'uan through Juko Kai by Rod Sacharnoski, and a Shihan rank in Koga ha Kosho Shorei Ryu Ninjutsu under Nimr Hassan. He also has earned a 1st Dan rank in the Budo Taijutsu of the Bujinkan under John Willson, and a 1st Dan rank in Taekwondo. He also holds a 3rd Dan rank in Kodokan Judo.\n\nIn 2001, Durbin published \"Mastering Kempo\", a general textbook of Kempo history, philosophy and technique. Also in 2001 he co-wrote \"Judo Techniques and Tactics\" with Jimmy Pedro. In 2004 he wrote \"Koga Ryu Ninjutsu\", a book on the history and basic techniques of ninjutsu, and in 2007 he wrote \"Renzoku Ken: Combat Combinations of Kempo\". Since 1989 he has also written several dozen articles for various martial arts magazines, including ten articles published in Black Belt Magazine.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1982 Durbin researched the history and techniques of martial arts in preparation for founding of a school, drawing on elements of each of the arts he studied, especially those arts he held Shihan ranking in. During this time, he was awarded an unaccredited Masters and Doctorate degree by Juko Kai through their diploma mill, the University of Oriental Philosophy in Murphy, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1986, Kiyojute Ryu opened its first dojo in Frankfort, as Durbin's own dojo switched from officially being a Juko Kai dojo to being a Kiyojute Ryu dojo. Durbin's aim was to create an art that reflects his Baptist and moral values, and places an emphasis on self-defense, compassion for ones fellow man, and responsible use of force rather than on aggression, destruction, or hurting others. Durbin point to historical martial arts masters such as Morihei Ueshiba combined spiritual training along with physical training, and that many masters were also clergy. Durbin was inspired in what he describes as a \"Tenshin Sho\" or where he received a divine inspiration to teach the martial arts. His teachings and techniques were devised in an attempt to pass along this inspiration and as he describes it \"how to love and live at peace\". He describes this in his writings as \"seeing the light\". \n\nKiyojute Ryu Kempo is built on the philosophy developed by Durbin in the 1970s. He coined the term \"Kiyojute\" to describe this philosophy of martial arts. The stated goal of Kiyojute Ryu is to train person through martial arts to have a closer relationship with God, a positive and healthy outlook on life, and to be gentle and compassionate in their actions with their fellow man, hence \"spiritually positive gentle hand/person\".\n\nDurbin has written that he considers it very important that his students understand that he is not a \"self proclaimed\" Soke and that he is acknowledged by other members of the martial arts community as a legitimate headmaster of a Kempo system. To this end he has sought recognition from other prominent martial artists, especially those in the training lineage of James Mitose.\n\nThe back cover of his book \"Mastering Kempo\" includes quotes of endorsement from Bill Beach and Bill \"Superfoot\" Wallace as to the martial arts skill of Durbin.\nThere, Bill Wallace is quoted describing him as \"one of the leading practitioners of Kempo\" and Bill Beach describes him as \"I have studied his methods and worked and practiced with him for five years. His skills and abilities in the martial arts, especially Kempo, are fascinating.\" \n\nThe first dedicated Kiyojute Ryu dojo was opened in 1986, and as early as 1988 additional dojo began to open with Brad Gardone going on to open a dojo of Kiyojute Ryu at the University of Louisville and later a separate dojo in Louisville away from the University. In the 1990s several more dojo would open, including Lexington, Kentucky, the University of Kentucky\n, Urbana, Illinois, Chicago, Illinois and Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe instruction is in a family atmosphere, where students train as partners instead of adversaries. Training is relatively informal, with little ritual aside from formalized bowing to begin and end class and a formal ceremony involved with belt tests and promotions. This is done with the intention of recreating some elements of pre-Meiji era martial arts schools. Part of the family atmosphere is the practice that its dojo are not widely distributed but spread through Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois and Tennessee. Part of the atmosphere family and mutual respect of Kiyojute Ryu includes the members of the class hugging each other after class. Kiyojute Ryu Kempo has no \"tournament\" or \"sport\" aspects, and training for competitions is never conducted.\n\nDurbin teaches Kempo from a Christian perspective and refers to his own dojo as the \"Christian Martial Arts Association\", which is also the name of the non-profit organization that Kiyojute Ryu is legally incorporated as. While he personally teaches from a Christian perspective, he states he is open to teaching students of any religion, quoting the style web site FAQ he explains how religion is handled:\n\nHowever Durbin also states, \" A person who just does not believe in God cannot possibly reach the highest levels of the martial arts, since they are of a spiritual nature.\".\n\nThe belief that Christianity is not unlike other religions such as Buddhism for purposes of the spiritual growth required for advanced-level practitioners of martial arts is not a belief unique to Kiyojute Ryu, Masaaki Hatsumi of Bujinkan has written that the spiritual goals with regards of the martial arts of Christianity and Buddhism are the same.\n\nEmily. “William Durbin - Children’s Literature.” Children’s Literature, 8 Dec. 2014, http://childrenslit.com/2014/12/08/william-durbin/.\n\n\n"}

Beith was eventually replaced by Jim Walker. The band released two singles in 1979, \"\"Heathen\" and \"King of Kings\", and the \"Kirk Brandon & The Pack of Lies\" EP in 1980, before splitting. Their posthumous releases were the \"Long Live the Past\" EP (1982), \"The Pack\" 1982 live album, recorded in 1979 and released on cassette only on Walker's Donut Records label, and the collection \"Dead Ronin\" (2001).\n\n\n\nIn 1980, The Pack disbanded. Joined by Luke Rendle (drums), Steve Guthrie (guitar), and John Lennard (saxophone), bassist Stan Stammers completed Brandon's line-up to form Theatre of Hate; the Werner brothers subsequently joined The Straps, the street punk band Stammers had played for prior. Inspired by Antonin Artaud's book \"Theatre and its Double\", the new band took its name from the concept of the Theatre of Cruelty: \"Artaud called for the emotional involvement of the audience. Singer Brandon borrowed the thespian term because he was trying to do the same.\"\n\n\"Original Sin\", Theatre of Hate's first single, was released in November 1980 as a double A-side with \"Legion\"; reaching No. 5 in the UK Indie Chart, it was followed by the singles \"Rebel Without a Brain\" in April 1981, and \"Nero\" in July. Early attention focused on the band as a live act, its full-length debut in 1981 being the album \"He Who Dares Wins (Live at the Warehouse Leeds)\", released on vinyl by Burning Rome Records. Guthrie left the band shortly after the album's release. Another live recording followed, \"Live at the Lyceum\", issued on cassette, also in 1981.\n\nIn August 1981, Mick Jones of The Clash produced \"Westworld\", Theatre of Hate's first (and only) studio album to be released prior to the band's dissolution the following year. Guitarist Billy Duffy (formerly of The Nosebleeds) joined the band soon after the album had been recorded, and drummer Rendle was replaced by Nigel Preston. Heralded by the Top 40 single \"Do You Believe in the West World\" (which afforded the new line-up the band's one appearance on Top of the Pops), \"Westworld\" was released in February 1982 by Burning Rome Records, peaking at No. 17 the following month during its seven week run in the UK Albums Chart. Recorded in September 1981 in Berlin, the live album \"He Who Dares Wins\" was also released in February in an attempt to curtail the sale of bootlegged recordings of Theatre of Hate concerts.\n\nA follow-up single, \"The Hop\", was released in May 1982 and peaked at No. 70. Of the two further singles planned for release, only \"Eastworld\" was issued, in August. In 1984, and subsequent to Theatre of Hate's split two years previous, Burning Rome Records released \"Revolution\", a compilation album that spent three weeks in the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 67. This posthumous album also included \"Americanos\", Theatre of Hate's final, unreleased single.\n\nBrandon went on to front Spear of Destiny with bassist Stammers. Brandon also was a founding member of the punk supergroup Dead Men Walking, while Stammers formed Plastic Eaters in 1996.\n\nPreston played with Sex Gang Children before joining former bandmate Duffy as drummer for the Cult on their 1984 album \"Dreamtime\". Preston later played with the Baby Snakes and the Gun Club before his death in 1992.\n\nTheatre of Hate reformed in 1991 for the Return to 8 tour, which included original band members Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, with the addition of three Spear of Destiny members, guitarist Mark Thwaite (also formerly of the Mission), drummer Pete Barnacle and keyboard player Volker Janssen. A live recording of the London Astoria show featuring this line-up was later included in the \"Act 4\" compilation.\n\nTheatre of Hate's unreleased second studio album, recorded in 1982, was released as \"Ten Years After\" in 1993.\n\nIn 1994, a line-up of Brandon, Stammers, guitarist John McNutt and drummer Art Smith went into Mix-O-Lydian Studio in Boonton, New Jersey with producer Brad Morrison to record a new album under the Theatre of Hate banner. As \"Stone in the Rain\", it was released by Anagram Records in 1995, credited to ; it was released in the US a year later as a Theatre of Hate album, retitled \"Retribution\".\n\nA 1996 tour featuring a line-up of Brandon, McNutt, Smith and new bassist Knut Knutson resulted in the live album \"Retribution Over the Westworld\", issued that year by Receiver Records. Another album of 1982 material recorded with Jones, \"Aria of the Devil\", was released in 1998 by Snapper Music, while \"Live at the Lyceum\" was reissued as \"Love Is a Ghost\" in 2000.\n\nTo coincide with \"Westworld\"'s 25th anniversary, Theatre of Hate reformed for a week-long tour culminating at the Carling Academy Islington on 29 April 2007. Of the original line-up, only Stammers was unavailable, due to conflicting schedules and family commitments in the US where he now lives. Replacing him was Craig Adams (former bassist for numerous bands including the Sisters of Mercy, the Mission, the Cult, the Alarm and Spear of Destiny), joining Brandon, Guthrie, Lennard and Rendle for the reunion.\n\nIn May 2012, Theatre of Hate, with a line-up of Brandon, Stammers and Lennard, augmented by Adrian Portas (New Model Army, Sex Gang Children, Spear of Destiny) on guitar and Mike Kelly on drums, reunited again for three \"Westworld\" 30th anniversary concerts, held in Bristol, London and Crewe. 2013 concerts in Birmingham and Bristol with this line-up were self-released as the CD/DVD set \"Live 2013\".\n\nAfter Kelly was replaced by Danny Ferrani, Theatre of Hate recorded a new four-song EP, \"Slave\", self-released in 2014.

It aims to reduce the gender gap in schooling for girls and to give girls equal access to all levels of education. \n\nAdopted at the June 13, 2008, meeting of the UNGEI Global Advisory Committee in Kathmandu, Nepal, the UNGEI vision statement is \"A world where all girls and boys are empowered through quality education to realize their full potential and contribute to transforming societies where gender equality becomes a reality.\"\n\nUNGEI, the EFA (Education for All) flagship for girls' education, is a partnership that embraces the United Nations system, governments, donor countries, non-governmental organizations, civil society, the private sector, and communities and families. UNGEI provides stakeholders with a platform for action and galvanizes their efforts to get girls in school.\n\nSome of the fundamental principles of the initiative include expanding the quality of education across the globe for all, improving the equality of access to education, and focusing on gender-responsive education. Within a country's education system, the education of girls must be mainstreamed, according to the initiative.\n\nThe UNGEI creators decided to take a 4-step approach to analyze the current education systems in order to monitor and evaluate change over time. The first step being diagnosing the current extent of girls' education in different regions. Next, locating supply factors in girls' education such as policies, reform, funding, etc. Afterward, identifying demand factors in education such as poverty, attitudes, and cultural practices affecting education rates. Lastly, pinpointing stakeholders in girls' education at various levels. Together, these steps provided UNGEI with a foundation for proper analysis of the current education system before moving forward. \n\nUNICEF is the lead agency and Secretariat for UNGEI. A Global Advisory Committee is composed of key partners who share in the planning, decision-making, guidance and accountability of UNGEI. UNGEI Focal Points in different regions facilitate the coordination of girls' education strategies and interventions at the country level. The purpose is not, however, limited to basic education; it focuses on a systematic approach. \n\nAt the country level, UNGEI supports country-led development and seeks to influence decision-making and investments to ensure gender equity and equality in national education policies, plans and programmes. It operates as a mechanism to advance education strategies and the technical capacity to assist countries. UNGEI partners mobilize resources for both targeted project interventions and country programmes as well as large scale systemic interventions designed to impact on the whole education system. UNGEI streamlines its efforts through the strategic use of existing mechanisms such as Poverty Reduction Strategies, sector-wide approaches and UN development assistance frameworks. \n\nIn May 2010, UNGEI organised the E4 conference on 'Engendering Empowerment: Education and Equality', held in Dakar, Senegal, and attended by a broad range of actors from national governments, UN agencies, and civil society.\n\nUNGEI members are actively involved in the EFA Working Group coordinated by UNESCO, the EFA Fast Track Initiative led by the World Bank and the Acceleration Strategy for Girls' Education developed by UNICEF. \n\nPartners include:\n\n"}

{"id": "2330667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330667", "title": "Improv Everywhere", "text": "Improv Everywhere\n\nImprov Everywhere (often abbreviated IE) is a comedic performance art group based in New York City, formed in 2001 by Charlie Todd. Its slogan is \"We Cause Scenes\".\n\nThe group carries out pranks, which they call \"missions\", in public places. The stated goal of these missions is to cause scenes of \"chaos and joy.\" Some of the group's missions use hundreds or even thousands of performers and are similar to flash mobs, while other missions utilize only a handful of performers. Improv Everywhere has stated that they do not identify their work with the term flash mob, in part because the group was created two years prior to the flash mob trend, and the group has an apolitical nature.\n\nWhile Improv Everywhere was created years before YouTube, the group has grown in notoriety since joining the site in April 2006. To date, Improv Everywhere's videos have been viewed over 470 million times on YouTube. They have over 1.9 million YouTube subscribers. In 2007, the group shot a television pilot for NBC. In May 2009, Harper Collins released a book about Improv Everywhere, \"Causing a Scene\" The book, written by founder Charlie Todd and \"senior agent\" Alex Scordelis, is a behind-the-scenes look at some of the group's stunts. In 2013, a feature-length documentary about Improv Everywhere premiered at the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. The film, titled \"We Cause Scenes\", was released digitally on iTunes, Netflix and other platforms in 2014.\n\nIn 2019, Improv Everywhere produced the Disney+ live-action series \"Pixar In Real Life\", which premiered on 12 November 2019, with twelve episodes set to release monthly.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Todd started the group in August 2001 after playing a prank in a Manhattan bar with some friends that involved him pretending to be musician Ben Folds. Later that year Todd started taking classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City where he first met most of the \"Senior Agents\" of Improv Everywhere. The owners of the theatre, The Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB), had a television series from 1998–2000 on Comedy Central. While primarily a sketch comedy show, the UCB often filmed their characters in public places with hidden cameras and showed the footage under the end credits. Both the UCB's show and their teachings on improv have been influential to Improv Everywhere. Todd currently performs on a house team at the UCBT in New York, where he also taught for many years.\n\nAll the missions share a certain \"modus operandi\": Members (\"agents\") play their roles entirely straight, not breaking character or betraying that they are acting. IE claims the missions are benevolent, aiming to give the observers a laugh and a positive experience.\n\nImprov Everywhere's most popular YouTube video is \"Frozen Grand Central\", which has received over 35 million views. The two-minute video depicts 207 IE Agents freezing in place simultaneously for five minutes in New York's Grand Central Terminal. The video was listed as number 49 in Urlesque's 100 Most Iconic Internet Videos. Martin Bashir declared on Nightline that the video was \"one of the funniest moments ever captured on tape.\" According to Charlie Todd, the prank has been recreated by fans in 100 cities around the world.\n\nOn 21 May 2005 IE staged a fake U2 street concert on a rooftop in New York hours before the real U2 were scheduled to perform at Madison Square Garden. Just like at the filming of the band's \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" video in 1987, the police eventually shut the performance down, but not before IE was able to exhaust their four-song repertoire and get most of the way through an encore repeat of \"Vertigo\".

The tracks are then listened to through headphones allowing for the listener to hear from the dummy’s perspective. The dummy head is designed to record multiple sounds at the same time enabling it to be exceptional at recording music as well as in other industries where multiple sound sources are involved.\n\nThe dummy head is designed to replicate an average-sized human head and depending on the manufacturer may have a nose and mouth too. Each dummy head is equipped with pinnae and ear canals in which small microphones are placed, one in each ear. The leading manufacturers in Dummy Head design are: Brüel & Kjær, Head Acoustics GmBH, Knowles Electronics, and GRAS Sound & Vibration.\n\nThe human perception of direction is complex:\n\nConventional music recording is produced for stereo playback which makes use of only Left and Right playback for speakers and headphones. The implementation of Dummy Head allows the recording artist to make use of three dimensional sound reproduction. This is because through playback via headphones the listener perceives sound as if they were in the position of the dummy. The recording is perceived through the pinnae of the dummy head.\n\nThere are two main methods used to create a binaural effect:\n\nThe main focus of recording with a dummy head is to achieve a perfect binaural playback that is suited to all listeners. The problem arises that each human head has different shaped and sized features. Due to the diversity in HRTFs it is impossible to create a binaural effect compatible for everyone’s ears. Therefore the simulated dummy head recording algorithm uses average HRTFs to create a moderate binaural effect for everyone.\n\nThe dummy head recording is associated with the use of the physical synthetic head called the “Kunstkopf”. The Kunstkopf would be placed in concert halls during the recording of a live orchestra or in the film industry actors could stand around the head whilst recording their dialogue. The dummy head could also be used to imprint positional information on prerecorded sound effects by playing sounds through a loudspeaker in a suitable orientation to the head. For example thunder and birdsong sounds to be played above the dummy head.\n\nDuring the 1990s, electronic devices which used digital signal processing (DSP) to reproduce HRTFs were made commercially available. These devices would allow the sound engineer to use dialled parameters to adjust the apparent direction of real time sounds. They were unusual and expensive, but would allow the sound engineer to alter special effects of prerecorded sounds quickly and conveniently. Through the manipulation of the parameters, sound engineers could take a monophonic recording of a passing car and make it sound as if it were passing behind them in real time. Recording with an actual dummy head for the same outcome would require a recording booth and a moving speaker, or an array of speakers as well as multiple panning or switching devices.\n\nThe dummy head manufacturers design their products differently to one another catering for specific situations. The GRAS dummy’s are flexible: they include head or torso with replaceable pinnae of different sizes and materials, set of different type ear-canal simulators, ear-drum simulators. Heads may include or not include mouth simulator. Brüel & Kjær design includes soft moulded pinnae, nose, mouth and torso. Any dummy head or HATS can be used to record audio of the same nature but different types of them are specifically designed to accomplish different tasks. A new manufacturer to the market for recording binaural is 3Dio with the purpose of recording on a smaller scale. The 3Dio microphones are situated in the ears at an average head distance apart, however the model does not include the full head or torso.\n\nThe main applications for the above manufacturers include:\nWithin the film industry \"Demolition\" was the first radio drama recorded using a dummy head.\n\nIn 1974 Virgin Records issued the first solo album by Tangerine Dream's leader Edgar Froese, titled \"Aqua\". The brief sleeve notes inform listeners that side 2 of the disc - i.e. the tracks \"NGC 891\" and \"Upland\" - were recorded using the artificial head system developed by Gunther Brunschen. Listeners were advised to optimise their listening by using stereo headphones for that side of the album.\n\nAlthough Edgar was keen to continue to use and promote this system for subsequent recordings, it was abandoned, due to the fact that, although it worked well through headphones, the improved sound quality did not translate adequately through a hi-fi speaker system.\n\nIn 2005, \"Aqua\" was remixed for limited edition reissue in Germany and Japan, with an additional track \"Upland Dawn\" appended to the end of the CD.\n\nIn 2015, Singaporean singer-songwriter JJ Lin released his debut experimental album \"From M.E. to Myself\", using dummy head recording. This is also the first album in pop music industry using this technology.\n\n"}

The two have collaborated since 1993 under a variety of names, including Axis, Hitch Hiker & Jacques Dumondt, and Mike Stone & Steve Heller, and have scored major club hits internationally, including a re-make of John Paul Young's \"Love Is in the Air\".\n\nInfluenced in the mid 1990s by Spain discohouse movement, Kronenberger (aka Milk) and Harding (aka Sugar) teamed up as a DJ and producer duo, creating Milk & Sugar in 1997.\n\nShortly afterwards, their own label called Milk & Sugar Recordings was founded. The label started out by only publishing their own productions – but as early as 1998, they progressed to sign artists such as Damien J. Carter, Tim Deluxe and Robbie Rivera. In 2000, Milk & Sugar Recordings was awarded with the as the Best Independent Label Spain.\n\nApart from Milk & Sugar, the most successful act signed to the label was Kid Alex, who in 2003, with his track, \"Young Love (Topless)\" and the album \"Colorz\", was signed worldwide by Universal Music Group. In 2007 and after the expiration of his contract, Kid Alex founded his new act .\n\nMilk & Sugar managed to break into the international scene with their song \"Higher & Higher\" in 2000, after David Morales included the song on a compilation album. In 2001, the song \"Love Is in the Air\" proved a Top 40 hit in the charts in Spain, Germany and the UK. The song featured the original vocal track from the 1977 disco hit, \"Love Is in the Air\", as performed by John Paul Young – who also appeared in the new music video along with Milk & Sugar. It reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart. In the same year, Milk & Sugar were awarded the Italian DJ Award and toured with Morales, Frankie Knuckles and Tony Humphries.\n\nIn 2003, \"Let the Sun Shine\", an Ibiza-inspired re-make of The 5th Dimension's #1 hit from 1969, \"Let The Sunshine In\" was released; was the most successful single of Milk & Sugar in the charts until then. It reached #1 in Hungary and the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs chart, as well as the Top 20 in the UK (#18), Greece, the Netherlands and Spain. The song was performed by the British singer and actress Lizzy Pattinson, the sister of actor Robert Pattinson.\n\nIn the years following, Milk & Sugar worked on their profile both as DJs and remixers. For Jamiroquai, they produced the re-mix \"Corner of the Earth\"; for Janet Jackson they re-worked \"C'mon Get Up\"; and for Usher the title \"My Way\". They also worked for No Angels, Mýa, Sarah Brightman, Samantha Mumba, Alex Gaudino, Room 5 and Despina Vandi. \n\nAs DJs, they started gathering international experience in Ibiza, in clubs such as Amnesia, Space and El Divino. They also toured in the UK, France, Spain, Italy and countries around the Mediterranean. Since 2002, they have been DJing in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Belarus.\n\nIn 2005, Milk & Sugar released another chart success in Germany with a reworking of Howard Jones' \"What Is Love\". Milk & Sugar also worked with the London based singer-songwriter Ayak Thiik (born 1983, Sudan). In the beginning, they worked together on tracks inspired by latin house, such as \"Shut Up\" and \"Need Your Loving\". Their third collaboration, \"Stay Around (For This)\" brought Milk & Sugar a further international hit. The song charted at #2 in Brazil.\n\nFor \"Let The Sun Shine 2009\", Milk & Sugar teamed up with the Jamaican vocalist, Gary Nesta Pine, and Bob Sinclar. \"Let The Sun Shine 2009\" also reached #1 in the UK Club Chart.\n\nThe two follow-up collaborations between Milk & Sugar and Thiik, \"You Got Me Burnin'\" and \"Let The Love (Take Over)\" also reached number 1 in the UK Club Chart. In 2010, their single \"Crazy\" saw Milk & Sugar and Thiik in a live performance recording, at the Planet Pop Event, held in 2009 in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nIn 2010, they remixed the song, \"Nah Neh Nah\", by the Belgian group, Vaya Con Dios, which reached the top ten sales charts in 10 countries and received gold in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The track was also nominated for the VIVA TV COMET awards as “Best Party Track of the Year 2011\" in Germany.\n\nTheir release in July 2011 is a tribute to Africa, where Milk & Sugar performed for the first time in the mid 1990s (Coumba Gawlo - Pata Pata). “Hi-a Ma (Pata Pata)”, which is the name of the song, features a part of the original recording from the 1967 hit “Pata Pata”, sung by South African singer and Grammy Award winning artist, Miriam Makeba.\n\nIn 2013 they released an alternative dance single named \"Canto del Pilon\", remixing the 1985 track with the same name by Maria Marquez and Frank Harris. that succeeded in reaching the Romanian top charts for the end of the year 2013. \n\nIBIZY SYMPHONICA in 2020 – Milk & Sugar’s selection of unforgettable Ibiza club classics, arranged for and recorded by the Munich Symphony Orchestra.

Most often 1-pentene is made as a byproduct of catalytic or thermal cracking of petroleum, or during production of ethylene and propylene via thermal cracking of hydrocarbon fractions. \n\nThe only commercial manufacturer of 1-pentene is Sasol Ltd, where it is separated from crude made by the Fischer-Tropsch process.\n\n2-Pentene has two geometric isomers, \"cis\"-2-pentene and \"trans\"-2-pentene. \"Cis\"-2-Pentene is used in olefin metathesis.\n\nThe branched isomers are 2-methylbut-1-ene, 3-methylbut-1-ene (isopentene), and 2-methylbut-2-ene (isoamylene).\n\nIsoamylene is one of three main byproducts of deep catalytic cracking (DCC), which is very similar to the operation of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). The DCC uses vacuum gas oil (VGO) as a feedstock to produce primarily propylene, isobutylene, and isoamylene. The rise in demand for polypropylene has encouraged the growth of the DCCU, which is operated very much like an FCCU. Isobutylene and isoamylene are feedstocks necessary for the production of the much debated gasoline blending components methyl \"tert\"-butyl ether (MTBE) and \"tert\"-amyl methyl ether (TAME).\n\nPropylene, isobutene, and amylenes are feedstock in alkylation units of refineries.

Animation and Noodle Soup Productions. The webseries, which ran from 2000 to 2002, starred Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Batgirl, Catwoman, Renee Montoya and Zatanna in short stories of varying length about the daily lives of the characters (from the DC Comics universe).\n\nIt is also the name of a related comic book series.\n\n\"Gotham Girls\" is one of the few series of Flash animations made by a professional publisher of mainstream cartoons, and features professional voice-acting by the same actresses and actors as those who voiced the television series. Its use of Flash (and also vector graphics) enables the animation to appear undistorted and unpixellated at any resolution. However, the episodes do not tend to show the Symbols (the pieces used to create the flash) outside of the intended viewing area. For example, in Season 1 Episode 1 while the light beam on Harley continues off screen, her body is only drawn for the dimensions of the intended viewing area.\n\nEach episode features a mini-game or puzzle which can be played while the clip downloads, as well as an interactive feature which allows viewers to help a character make a certain decision.\n\nOther features of the website include downloadable trailers, screensavers, desktop backgrounds, internet chat buddy icons, as well as biographies of the characters, and an online version of the classic game Othello (aka Reversi) featuring the Gotham Girls. The screensavers, desktop backgrounds and internet chat buddy icon sites, however, no longer work, and simply redirect to the Warner Bros. website, as the Gotham Girls website also does.\n\nThe series lasted for three seasons (10 episodes each), with each episode released month-by-month. While the first two seasons featured primarily comedic episodes, the third season attempted to make the show more serious. These episodes linked directly to \"\". Dropping the magician Zatanna from its lineup and adding a host of new characters to the cast, including Detective Renee Montoya, each episode from this series tied into the next, forming a collective thirty-minute whodunit. The storyline also dealt with issues not seen since \"\", such as the corruption of the Gotham City Police Department, Poison Ivy's environmental crusade and Commissioner Gordon's wavering faith in costumed superheroes. It is also heavily implied that the series takes place in the DC animated universe. One significant aspect of the third season is the appearance of Det. Selma Reesedale, a character revealed early on to be a transgender woman.\n\nThe series finale, \"Cold Hands, Cold Heart\" aired in 2002, wrapping up the mystery and ending the website. The final episode was dedicated to the memory of Hilary J. Bader, script writer for numerous DC Animated series, and who had died in 2002 of cancer. GothamGirls.com is no longer online, but the individual .swf files were still accessible until mid-2015.\n\n\nDC Comics produced a five-issue \"Gotham Girls\" comic book miniseries in 2003, written by Paul Storrie. It starred Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, Batgirl, with each issue spotlighting one of these characters to a certain degree. The story, which took place in the DC animated universe, involved a vial of chemicals that the three villainesses fought over, as they also tried to avoid capture by Batgirl and Detective Montoya. A three-issue miniseries, \"Batman: Harley and Ivy\", followed the continued misadventures of Harley and Ivy.\n\nThe complete \"Gotham Girls\" series was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release of the \"Birds of Prey\" television series, released by Warner Home Video on July 15, 2008.

It is most commonly used in the making of fur hats and coats, and is considered quite valuable today, although it was once a lower-priced commodity in the fur trade.\n\nThe hair of a rabbit can be divided into three types: \"longer, rectrix guard hairs, stiff at the base; the more numerous tectrix barbed hairs forming the major part of the coat, which share a hair follicle with the third type-the shorter hairs making up the undercoat.\" \nColloquially, these types are called\n\nA selectively bred rabbit from the 1900s, the Rex rabbit, has guard hairs of the same length as the down, but this is an atypical recessive trait that is relatively rare in wild rabbits.\n\nRabbit hair is commonly considered a byproduct of the ordinary process of breeding rabbits for meat, and as such is manufactured in vast quantities in England and France; more than seventy million pelts a year in France alone. However, the quality of fur from these rabbits tends to be low, as the rabbits are slaughtered before reaching twelve weeks old and still have the infant coat. The lower quality hair is sometimes used for felt.\n\nIn temperate climates, the highest quality furs are obtained in winter from rabbits over five months old, when the thickness of the fur is even; at other times of year, varying degrees of hair shedding causes uneven patches in the fur. The coat is also at its thickest at this time of year. The highest quality pelts are suitable for clothing, and typically constitute less than half of all pelts collected. The hair of the Angora rabbit is plucked or shaved and used as fiber, rather than as pelts.\n\nRabbit fur products have a tendency to shed more easily than some other furs and might not have the same longevity.\n\nThe use of rabbit pelts in the commercial fur trade took off in the 1920s, when it was incorporated into everything from hats to stoles, coats and baby blankets. By 1924, it accounted for half the US fur trade. While it was considerably cheaper than furs from other animals, it had softness and density and could also be dyed, plucked or shorn to look like other furs – shearing was also known as blocking.\n\nWhite pelts commanded a premium since they could be most easily dyed and in their natural state bore a close resemblance to much pricer ermine (stoat). New Zealand white rabbit (actually bred in the US) was highly prized, but other rabbit varieties in different hues – including Havana, Lilac and Checkered Giant were also valuable because they could be used in their natural colouring. One commentator noted in the 1920s: \"[W]here one sealskin coat graced Milady of Fifth Avenue in 1900, a hundred thousand coats of rabbit-seal are turned out on Sixth Avenue during the fur season for the Misses of Main Street all over America\".\n\nNames developed such as minkony, ermiline and northern seal – all of which were rabbit fur. After 1938, American fur coats had to be labelled using the name of the animal used in its making – for instance 'seal dyed coney' or 'beaver dyed rabbit' – in order to avoid confusion among consumers.\n\n\n"}

Their legal status was close to that of slaves.\n\nThe word \"kholop\" was first mentioned in a chronicle for the year of 986. Its etymology is unclear. By one hypothesis, the word is cognate with Slavic words translated as \"boy\" (more specifically, adolescent male; modern Ukrainian: хлопець (\"khlopets\"), Polish: \"chłopiec\", Bulgarian: \"хлапе\"/\"хлапак\"), which is similar to the use of the English word boy as \"servant\".\n\nThe Slavic word itself is derived from the hypothetical root \"*chol\" related to premarital state, unmarriedness, inability for reproduction. By another hypothesis, it is derived from a Germanic root, represented in English by the word \"help\".\n\nThe \"Russkaya Pravda,\" a legal code of the late Kievan Rus, details the status and types of \"kholops\" of the time.\n\nIn the 11th - 12th centuries, the term referred to different categories of dependent people and especially slaves. A \"kholop\"’s master had unlimited power over his life, e.g., he could kill him, sell him, or pay his way out of debt with him. The master, however, was responsible for a \"kholop\"’s actions, such as insulting a freeman or stealing.\n\nA person could become a \"kholop\" as a result of capture, selling oneself, being sold for debts, after having committed crimes, or through marriage to a \"kholop\". Until the late 15th century, the \"kholops\" represented a majority among the servants, who had been working lordly lands. Some \"kholops\", mainly house serfs, replenished the ranks of the princely servants (including those in the military) or engaged themselves in trades, farming, or administrative activities.\n\nThroughout the 16th century, the \"kholops\"’ role in the corvée economy had been diminishing due to the increasing involvement of peasant exploitation (\"see Russian serfdom\"). At the turn of the 16th century, the service class \"kholops\" (служилое холопство, \"sluzhiloye kholopstvo\") began to emerge and spread across the country. In the late 17th century, there were also \"kholops\" \"chained\" to their land (посаженные на землю, \"posazhenniye na zemlyu\"), who took care of their own household and had to pay quitrent. Those \"kholops\", who had been house serfs, were subject to poll tax in 1722-1724 and were thereafter treated as ordinary serfs.\n\"Combat servants\" (), also known as \"military slaves\" in literature, constituted an armed retinue and personal protection for large and medium-sized landowners in the 16th-18th centuries, and carried out military service together with noblemen, constituting a considerable part of the \"Landed army\". They were equipped as mounted archers, usually wearing cheap quilted armor and caps.\n"}

The town is about 12.87 km (8 mi) from the island's north coast. The ugli fruit was first discovered in 1914 growing wild near the town.\n\nOne notable region is called Tobolski.\n\nThe town was founded by Hamilton Brown (died 1843) who is buried in the local Anglican church.\n\nDr James Johnston who had been born in Scotland in 1851 arrived in Jamaica in 1874. He started his Jamaican Evangelical Mission in 1876. Johnston created nine churches but the base of his medical mission and his religious assemblies were in Brown's Town. Johnston became the political representative for St Ann's Parish before he left to explore Africa. In the 1890s he took a team of Afro-Caribbean Jamaicans to England where they were equipped themselves to complete a 20-month journey of 4,500 miles through south central Africa. Their journey was photographed and described by a book published in 1893.\n\nBrown's Town became significant as a market centre in the mid-19th century following the abolition of slavery.\n\nAccording to Kamala Harris’ father (Donald J.

According to Donald J. Harris, Christiana was born in 1889, 46 years after Hamilton Brown died in 1843 so he is not Christiana's father. He is potentially Christiana's great grandfather, but it is unclear how she became his descendant given that Hamilton Brown has many black descendants in Brown's Town, St Ann, Jamaica. According to one elderly local in 2010; \"A good amount of Brown live here, you know,\" he said. \"People what name Brown pack up the place. It all coming from Hamilton Brown who the town name after.

It shared its eastern border with the Kingdom of Jimma, its southern border with the Kingdom of Gomma and its western border with the Kingdom of Gumma. Beyond its northern border lay tribes of the Macha Oromo. Jimma was considered the most civilized of the Gibe kingdoms, which had a population in the 1880s between 10,000 and 12,000. It was converted to Islam by missionaries from Harar in the first half of the 19th century; C.T. Beke, writing in 1841, reported that its \"king and most of his subjects are Mohammedan.\" Limmu-Ennarea's capital was at Saqqa.\n\nThe location of this former kingdom has a north to south central elevation between 1,500 and over 2,000 metres (5,000 to over 6,500 feet), and is covered with forests. The population of this kingdom was estimated in 1880 to have been about 40,000, including slaves. However, this was after an epidemic of plague in the late 1840s, and Mordechai Abir estimates the population before that calamity to have been around 100,000.\n\nThe kingdom of Limmu-Ennarea was a continuation of the older kingdom of Ennarea, which successfully resisted for many decades the encroaching Oromo, who had overrun other kingdoms tributary to the Ethiopian Emperor including Bizamo and Konch. Despite this, as Mohammed Hassen observes, Ennarea eventually drifted into an extended period of civil war and by \"the middle of the second half of the seventeenth century, Ennarya not only lacked a single leadership, but also her feuding leaders probably fought more with each other than with their common enemy.\" In 1704, when Emperor Iyasu the Great campaigned south of the Abay River, and reached Gonga, the stronghold of Ennarea on the Gibe River, he was met by two rival leaders of the crumbling kingdom. In the years following the Emperor's expedition to Ennarea, the warring potentates gradually fled south to the Kingdom of Kaffa. The remaining Sidamo population was absorbed by the Oromo, who as a practice made no distinction in ethnic ancestry for inclusion into their society.\n\nEventually a powerful war leader, Bofo the son of Boku, came to dominate the Limmu Oromo by his military prowess and charisma; Mohammed Hassen dates this development between 1800 and 1802. He formed a dynastic bond with the daughter of Abba Rebu, who traced his ancestry to both the earlier dynasty that ruled Ennarea, as well as a Portuguese soldier from Cristóvão da Gama's army who had come to live in Ennarea. Abir also notes that another tradition states that this marriage was a political union between two rival clans, the Sapera and the Sigaro. In either case, due to this Portuguese influence, the kings of Limmu-Ennarea called themselves \"supera\", unlike the other Gibe kings who used the Oromo word \"Moti\" which originally indicated the office of the war leader (also called \"Abba Dula\") during the cycle of his Gadaa.\n\nIn 1825, Bofu abdicated in favor of his son, Abba Bagibo, under whose rule Limmu-Ennarea reached the peak of its existence. Due to wars in neighboring Jimmu, merchants used the trade route through his kingdom to gain access to Kaffa. Abba Bagibo made a concerted effort to promote this trade, both with beneficial policies (e.g., offering security from bandits to traders, and lower tariffs) and with coercive ones (requiring merchants from Gondar, Adwa, Derita and Dawe to meet their counterparts from Kaffa and further south at Saqqa).\n\nDuring Abba Bagibo's reign, the Kingdom of Limmu-Ennarea adopted Islam as the state religion. When Catholic missionaries later opened a mission in the kingdom in 1846, the king told them that \"had you come thirty years ago, not only I but all my countrymen might have embraced your religion, but now it is impossible.\"\n\nJimma's eventual success at conquering the Badi-Folla in 1847 reopened the trade route between Kaffa and Shewa, which merchants found to be a much better route. This also brought an end to Limmu-Ennarea prosperity, despite Abba Bagido's later actions. On his death in 1861, Abba Bagido was succeeded by his \"untalented and fanatic Muslim son\", who hastened the kingdom's decline.\n\nLimmu-Ennarea was secured for Shewa by Ras Gobana Dacche following the decisive Battle of Embabo, without a single blow being struck; however, when Ras Gobana fell from power a few years later in the mid-1880s, the entire Gibe region erupted in revolt. Dejazmach Wolde Giyorgis then re-conquered the kingdom by force; the Dejazmach afterwards built a church dedicated to St Marqos near the royal palace. Abba Bagibo, the son of the last king, Abba Gomoli, converted to Christianity for political advantages, changed his name to Gabra Selassie, and became a Fitawrari in the Ethiopian Empire.\n\n"}

He was the subject of Victoria's biggest fraud case and known as \"Australia's greatest conman\".\n\nHohenberger was a West German national. In August 1972, he began working as an independent contractor with the German road construction company Strassen und Teerbau. Around July 1974, he forged road building orders from distant mountain towns and used them to order Strassen und Teerbau to build roads. No roads were ever built, and no earthworks or materials were ever bought. Hohenberger embezzled DM200,000 from the company.\n\nHohenberger was on a skiing holiday in Italy at the time German police issued a warrant for his arrest. He never returned to Germany. Having gone out onto the slopes and not returned, it was thought he had died. Although German police were sceptical of his disappearance, believing that somebody had tipped him off to the investigation, the discovery of his bags over a year later reinforced the theory that he had either had an accident or committed suicide.\n\nOn 20 January 1975, Hohenberger arrived in Melbourne on a flight from Auckland, New Zealand. According to Department of Immigration records, Hohenberger left Australia on a flight to Singapore on 22 January. It is thought he tricked Australian Customs into believing he had boarded a plane but remained in Australia.\n\nUsing the name John Friedrich and fake qualifications, Hohenberger obtained a contract with construction company Codelfa Cogefar, working on part of the Melbourne underground rail loop. He subsequently worked for the Board of Ecumenical Missions and Relations (BOEMAR), a Uniting Church in Australia organisation responsible for the Church's Aboriginal missions. He was offered the position of community adviser at Ernabella in South Australia, where he was to assist the Aboriginal community with its development and to supervise civil works.\n\nWhile working in Ernabella, Friedrich became ill with a serious infection and was treated by nurse Shirley Manning. Friedrich and Manning became engaged in October 1975 and married on 10 February 1976 in Sydney. They moved to the BOEMAR mission on Mornington Island, where Shirley was to work as a nursing sister and John as the manager. During his time on Mornington, Friedrich was responsible to the Australian Government as well as to the Church. While the Church was only concerned with the day-to-day running of the island, as an agent of the government, Friedrich acted as a coastal watcher for the Royal Australian Navy, a fisheries officer, a licensee for the government-owned pub, an agent for a shipping company and the airline that serviced the island, a reporting officer for the Department of Civil Aviation. Friedrich also began studying again while at Mornington, working on an external master's degree in engineering science with the University of Queensland. The Friedrichs resigned from BOEMAR in late 1976 but stayed to oversee relief opportunities until January 1977 after Cyclone Ted destroyed 90 per cent of all buildings on the island.\n\nIn November 1976, the Friedrichs had taken a holiday to Victoria. While there, having seen an advertisement in \"The Age\", Friedrich applied for the position of safety engineer with the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) Victorian Division, to be based at the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) Yallourn power station in the Latrobe Valley. Upon returning to Mornington, Friedrich was informed that the job at Yallourn was his if he wanted it. Friedrich began working for the NSCA in January 1977.\nFriedrich became executive director of NSCA in 1982 and began to transform it into a national search and rescue organisation. He built up the company with loans in which 27 banks agreed to lend millions of dollars with little more surety than Friedrich's word. McGregor-Lowndes attributes this lack of probity to the halo effect of NSCA and Friedrich himself. In 1988, he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) \"in recognition of service to the community, particularly in the area of industrial safety and search and rescue services\".\n\nFollowing the financial collapse of NSCA in 1989, Friedrich went into hiding. After a nationwide and international manhunt, involving all Australian police forces and Interpol, he was arrested in Perth, Western Australia on 6 April 1989. He was initially charged with one count of obtaining financial advantage by deception. On 1 November, he was charged on a further 91 counts of obtaining property by deception.\n\nIn subsequent investigations, it was discovered that Friedrich was not an Australian citizen, did not possess any valid birth certificate, and did not appear on any electoral roll. This caused considerable embarrassment to the Department of Defence, which had given him a security clearance and almost unlimited access to Royal Australian Air Force bases.\n\nThe Friedrichs lived with Shirley's brother in Sydney until the start of the trial. On 23 July 1991, Friedrich appeared in court for fraud involving $296,662,436.99.\n\nOn 27 July 1991, Friedrich was found dead on his farm near Sale, Victoria with a single gunshot wound to the head in a wide-open muddy field. A helicopter was seen flying low over this area prior to the discovery of the body. His death was ruled to be suicide.\n\nFriedrich was writing an autobiography with the assistance of Richard Flanagan at the time of his death. It was published posthumously. In it, he claimed to have been born in South Australia in 1945 to German parents, attended boarding school in West Germany and studied engineering at the Technische Hochschule. Friedrich also claimed that, while working for an American construction company, he was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and, under the codename \"Iago\", worked in Laos, Vietnam, Egypt, New Zealand and West Germany against far left-wing extremists before returning to Australia in 1975. Simon Caterson, writing in \"The Australian\", described it as \"one of the least reliable but most fascinating memoirs in the annals of Australian publishing\". A subsequent 2017 essay by Caterson likening Friedrich to Jeff Tracy is titled \"John Friedrich: Australia's Most Altruistic Fraudster\".\n"}

Negotiations were concluded on November 17, 1905. The treaty deprived Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty and made Korea a protectorate of Imperial Japan. It resulted from Imperial Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905.\n\nIn the metonymy Eulsa Treaty, the word \"Eulsa\" or \"Ulsa\" derives the Sexagenary Cycle's 42nd year of the Korean calendar, in which the treaty was signed. The treaty is identified by several names including \"Second Japan–Korea Convention\" (Japanese: 第二次日韓協約, Korean: 제2차 한일협약, 第二次韓日協約), \"Eulsa Restriction Treaty\" (Korean: 을사늑약, 乙巳勒約), \"Eulsa Protection Treaty\" (Japanese: 乙巳保護条約, Korean: 을사보호조약), and \"Korea Protection Treaty\" (Japanese: 韓国保護条約).\n\nFollowing Imperial Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, with its subsequent withdrawal of Russian influence, and the Taft–Katsura Agreement, in which the United States allegedly agreed not to interfere with Japan in matters concerning Korea, the Japanese government sought to formalize its sphere of influence over the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDelegates of both Empires met in Seoul to resolve differences in matters pertaining to Korea's future foreign policy; however, with the Korean Imperial palace under occupation by Japanese troops, and the Imperial Japanese Army stationed at strategic locations throughout Korea, the Korean side was at a distinct disadvantage in the discussions.\n\nOn 9 November 1905, Itō Hirobumi arrived in Hanseong and gave a letter from the Emperor of Japan to Gojong, Emperor of Korea, asking him to sign the treaty. On 15 November 1905, he ordered Japanese troops to encircle the Korean imperial palace and threatened the emperor in order to force him to agree to the treaty.\n\nOn 17 November 1905, Ito and Japanese Field Marshal Hasegawa Yoshimichi entered the Jungmyeongjeon Hall, a Russian-designed building that was once part of Deoksu Palace, to persuade Gojong to agree, but he refused. Ito pressured the cabinet with the implied, and later stated, threat of bodily harm, to sign the treaty. According to 한계옥 (Han-Gyeok), Korean prime minister Han Gyu-seol disagreed, shouting loudly. Ito ordered the guards to lock him in a room and said if he continued screaming, they could kill him. The Korean cabinet signed an agreement that had been prepared by Ito in the Jungmyeongjeon. The Agreement gave Imperial Japan complete responsibility for Korea's foreign affairs, and placed all trade through Korean ports under Imperial Japanese supervision.\n\nThis treaty deprived Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty, in effect making Korea a protectorate of Imperial Japan. The provisions of the treaty took effect on November 17, 1905, and it laid the foundation for the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907, and subsequent annexation of Korea in 1910.\n\nThe treaty was deemed to have gone into effect after it received the signature of five Korean ministers:\n\nEmperor Gojong of Korea did not assent or sign the treaty. Other officials who disputed the treaty included:\n\nEmperor Gojong sent personal letters to major heads of state to appeal for their support against the illegal signing. As of February 21, 1908, he had sent 17 letters bearing his imperial seal, to the following eight rulers:\n\nIn 1907, Emperor Gojong sent three secret emissaries to the second international Hague Peace Convention to protest the unfairness of the Eulsa Treaty. But the great powers of the world refused to allow Korea to take part in the conference.\n\nNot only the Emperor but other Koreans protested against the Treaty. Jo Byeong-se and Min Yeong-hwan, who were high officials and led resistance against Eulsa treaty, killed themselves as resistance. Local yangbans and commoners joined righteous armies. They were called \"Eulsa Euibyeong\" (을사의병, 乙巳義兵) meaning \"Righteous army against Eulsa Treaty\".\n\nAfter completing the treaty, Emperor Gojong tried to let the world know the unfairness of the treaty, including sending a special envoy to The Hague. This directly contributed to the forced retirement of King Gojong.\n\nThis treaty, later, was confirmed to be \"already null and void\" by the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea concluded in 1965.\n\nIn a joint statement on June 23, 2005, officials of South Korea and North Korea reiterated their stance that the Eulsa treaty is null and void on a claim of coercion by the Japanese.\n\nAs of 2010, South Korea was seizing property and other assets from the descendants of people who have been identified as pro-Japanese collaborators (Chinilpa) at the time of the treaty.\n\n\n"}

McNeill (December 23, 1907 – May 7, 1996) was an American radio personality, best known as the creator and host of \"The Breakfast Club\", which ran for more than 35 years.\n\nMcNeill was born in Galena, Illinois, son of Harry T. McNeill and Luella R. Weinberger. The family soon moved to Sheboygan, Wisconsin, where McNeill graduated from Marquette University in Milwaukee. He was a first cousin of United States Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger; McNeill's mother was the elder sister of Weinberger's father.\n\nMcNeill began his radio career in Milwaukee in 1928, first as a script editor and announcer at \"The Milwaukee Sentinel\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s WISN, and later working for crosstown competitor WTMJ, owned by \"Sentinel\" rival \"The Milwaukee Journal\". McNeill moved on to Kentucky, working for the \"Louisville Courier-Journal\"'s station, WHAS. This was followed by working in San Francisco as a comedy act with singer Van Fleming, called \"The Two Professors.\" After a failed career move to New York City, McNeill returned to Illinois in 1933.\n\nMcNeill applied for a job at NBC and was sent to Chicago to audition. He was assigned to host an unsponsored early morning variety show called \"The Pepper Pot\", which had an 8 AM time slot on the NBC Blue Network (later to become ABC radio). McNeill re-organized the hour show as \"The Breakfast Club\", dividing it into four segments he called \"the four calls to breakfast.\" The show premiered on June 23, 1933, with informal talk and jokes based on topical events, and often included audience interviews. In its final form, the show featured piano music and vocal groups and soloists, with recurring comedy performers. McNeil gained a sponsor, Swift and Company. McNeill is credited as the first performer to make morning talk and variety a viable format in radio. (Countless local shows even now refer to themselves as \"The Breakfast Club\").\n\nArchie Bleyer, who led the band for Arthur Godfrey's daily \"Arthur Godfrey Time\" on CBS radio, had founded Cadence Records in 1953. That year, Bleyer traveled to Chicago to record some patriotic spoken word recordings by McNeill. Although \"Breakfast Club\" ratings were below Godfrey's, the latter took umbrage that Bleyer had taken time off from the Godfrey show to record McNeill, who Godfrey considered a competitor. In October 1953, on the same day Godfrey fired singer Julius LaRosa on the air, Godfrey privately dismissed Bleyer for recording McNeill.\n\nMcNeill attempted to transfer the show to television as \"Don McNeill's TV Club\" (1950–1951). \"The Breakfast Club\" was simulcast on television in 1954-1955. McNeill appeared occasionally on game shows, and in 1963 hosted a short-lived game show \"Take Two\", built around photo comparisons. McNeill's radio series finally ended in 1968, when McNeill retired from entertainment and public life.\n\nAfter his radio career ended, McNeill taught communication arts classes at Marquette and Notre Dame from 1970-72, represented the Deltona Corporation, Florida land developers, from 1970-80, and served as a director of the Sears Foundation and on the advisory boards of Notre Dame, Marquette and Loyola University of Chicago.\n\nDon McNeill's \"Breakfast Club\" was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1989. Seven years later, McNeill died at Evanston Hospital in Evanston, Illinois, aged 88.\n\n"}

It appeared in 1996, and differs from R-trees (1984), R+-trees (1987) and R*-trees (1990) because it emphasizes prevention of overlap in the bounding boxes, which increasingly becomes a problem in high dimensions. In cases where nodes cannot be split without preventing overlap, the node split will be deferred, resulting in super-nodes. In extreme cases, the tree will linearize, which defends against worst-case behaviors observed in some other data structures. \n\nThe X-tree consists of three different types of nodes-data nodes, normal directory nodes and supernodes. The data nodes of the X-tree contain rectilinear minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) together with pointers to the actual data objects, and the directory nodes contain MBRs together with pointers to sub-MBRs. Supernodes are large directory nodes of variable size(a multiple of the usual block size). The basic goal of supernodes is to avoid splits in the directory that would result in an inefficient directory structure.\n"}

She duetted with singer Prince on the hit song \"Diamonds and Pearls\".\n\nShe released a number of dance hits, the most notable being \"Closer Than Close\", which made the top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in 1997. The song appeared on the compilation album \"Now 37\", released in July 1997. \n\nGaines' first band was a family funk/soul group called Unity, with Gaines on organ, her brother Carl on bass guitar, her cousin Lacy on guitar, sister-in-law Dianne on background vocals and her sister Mal on drums.\n\nGaines also played in a band called The Oasis and A Touch of Class before joining The Curtis Ohlson Band (with Levi Seacer, Jr. on guitar). Seacer called Gaines one day and asked her to come to Minneapolis, Minnesota to sing a demo of a song for The Pointer Sisters.\n\nWhile she was doing the demo, Prince came in the recording studio, was impressed by her abilities and asked her to join his band The New Power Generation. Gaines was introduced in 1990 as the new vocalist and keyboard player on Prince's Nude Tour. Her first appearance on a Prince album was on \"Graffiti Bridge\", her vocals prominent on the second single, \"New Power Generation\". She was also a member of The NPG in the film \"Graffiti Bridge\". She wrote and performed on the \"Diamonds and Pearls\" album, her lead and background vocals prominently featured on most of the albums tracks, including the hit singles \"Gett Off\", \"Cream\" and \"Diamonds and Pearls\". In 1992, after the \"Diamonds and Pearls\" tour concluded, Gaines returned to her solo career, although she continued to work with Prince from time to time. Prince produced the official remix to Gaines' 1995 solo single \"I Want U\", titled \"I Want U (Purple Version)\". She duetted with Prince on the live version of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\", which is available on his 1993 compilation album, \"The Hits/The B-Sides\" and also contributed vocals to the tracks \"I Rock Therefore I Am\" (from Prince's 1996 \"Chaos and Disorder\" album), \"Jam Of The Year\" (from Prince's 1996 Emancipation album) and a re-recorded version of \"1999\" (entitled \"1999: The New Master\"), which was released by Prince & The NPG in 1999. Gaines also appeared alongside Prince, Larry Graham, and members of The Family Stone (and others) in a special New Year concert in 1999, which was released on DVD under the title \"Rave Un2 The Year 2000\".\n\nGaines recorded her first solo album, titled \"Caring\", in 1985, followed by the 1987 album \"No Sweeter Love\". Although neither album received much commercial interest at the time, both albums have subsequently been released in a digital format on iTunes.\n\nFollowing her 3-year tenure with Prince & The NPG, between 1990 and 1992, Gaines started recording her next solo album. Several albums worth of material were recorded, and an album was set for release on Paisley Park Records under the title \"Concrete Jungle\". However it was not released because of a legal battle between Prince and Warner Bros. Records, and remained unreleased until 2010.\n\nStarting over, Gaines eventually released her third solo album (her first post-NPG album) on Motown Records in 1995. The album, titled \"Closer Than Close\", spawned the singles \"I Want U\" and \"Are You Ready?\", and included the song \"My Tender Heart\", a song composed by Gaines and Prince and featuring background vocals by Prince and long-time NPG collaborators The Steeles, which Gaines had earlier performed on \"The Ryde Dyvine\" TV special in late 1992. In 1995 Gaines also collaborated with Tevin Campbell on the song \"I2I\", which was featured in the Disney movie \"A Goofy Movie\".\n\nA club remix of Gaines' song \"Closer Than Close\" was released as a single two years later, in 1997. The \"Closer Than Close\" remix was commercially very successful in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart. It also charted on the Australian club charts and has appeared on numerous club compilation albums. The track earned Gaines a MOBO Award for Best International Single at the ’97 Awards show (beating the likes of P Diddy, previously known as Puff Daddy, R Kelly and Tina Moore), and inspired Gaines to record a follow-up club track, \"I Surrender\", which was released later that year. The remix of \"Closer Than Close\" is now considered a club classic, and has been re-remixed a number times since its initial release.\n\nWith her own record label Dredlix Records, Gaines strove to bring her music directly via the Internet. In 1997, she released an Internet-only album, \"Arrival\". Limited to 2,000 copies, it was available exclusively through her official website.\n\nIn 2003, she released her album \"You Gave Me Freedom\" through Dome Records in the UK. In 2005, Gaines provided her vocals for the single \"Dance With Me\", which was recorded by K-Klass and released on SUSU Records. Gaines released her album \"Welcome to My World\" for SUSU Records in November 2006. She also self-released the album \"Soul Survivor\" in 2013, which included 5 songs from \"You Gave Me Freedom\" alongside new and previously unreleased material.\n\nThe compilation albums \"Essential Rosie\", a 'hits' album of sorts, and \"Dance with Me\", a club album that includes the singles \"Dance with Me\" (with K-Klass) and \"Release the Pressure\" (with Red), were both released in 2015.\n\n"}

Located in Kosciuszko National Park, the mountain is north of Australia's highest mainland peak, Mount Kosciuszko.\n\nAlthough lower than Mount Kosciuszko, Mount Townsend has a more craggy peak and is arguably more dominant than the relatively round-topped Mount Kosciuszko.\n\nThe confusion about swapping the names of Mount Kosciuszko and Mount Townsend was straightened out in 1940 by B. T. Dowd, a cartographer and historian of the NSW Lands Department. His study reaffirmed that the mountain named by Strzelecki as Mount Kosciuszko was indeed, as the NSW maps had always shown, Australia's highest summit. When Macarthur's field book of the historical journey was published in 1941 by C. Daley it further confirmed Dowd's clarification. This means that Targangil, mentioned in Spencer's 1885 article, was the indigenous name of Mount Townsend, not of Mount Kosciuszko.\n\nWhilst Mount Townsend is main land Australia's second highest peak, it is not the second highest mountain because of its prominence of only 189m. Instead main land Australia's second highest mountain is Mount Bogong in Victoria.\n\n"}

Fox\" (DD/DDR-829) was a in the United States Navy during World War II and the years following. She was named for Myles C. Fox, a USMC lieutenant who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for actions during World War II.\n\n\"Myles C. Fox\" was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation, Bath, Maine on 14 August 1944, launched on 13 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. James C. Fox, mother of Lieutenant Fox; and commissioned at Boston on 20 March 1945, Comdr. John S. Fahy in command.\n\nAfter Caribbean shakedown and training off New Jersey, \"Myles C. Fox\" sailed on 5 July 1945 for the Panama Canal, San Diego, and Hawaii, arriving Pearl Harbor on the 28th. She departed Pearl Harbor on 10 August to Marshall, Operation Downfall, Olympic (plate #117 staging of forces) receiving word en route of cessation of hostilities. After calling at Eniwetok, she continued to Japan, anchoring in Tokyo Bay on 9 September to begin duty screening carriers providing air cover for the occupation landings on Japan.\n\nThe destroyer served in the occupation until sailing for Saipan on 8 January 1946. On 25 March, she headed from the Marianas for San Diego with veterans aboard for transportation home. Arriving 11 April, she operated along the west coast until 6 January 1947, when she sailed for the Far East, arriving Yokosuka on the 25th. In ensuing months she called at principal ports of Japan with missions to Korea, China, Okinawa, and Hong Kong.\n\nOn 19 July \"Myles C. Fox\" and with British escort ship saved the crew and passengers of SS \"Hong Kheng\" after the passenger ship had run aground on Chilang Point some 8 miles north of Hong Kong. Six motorboats, two from each warship, and two skiffs from Hong Kong, made 76 trips to rescue some 1,800 survivors.\n\n\"Myles C. Fox\" departed Yokosuka on 23 September and reached San Diego on 8 October. After west coast operations and overhaul, she made another Far Eastern cruise, 2 October – 23 December 1948, operating principally in the ocean approaches to Tsingtao, China, with fast carrier forces. She then operated out of San Diego until sailing on 2 May 1949 for a new home port, Newport, Rhode Island. She had been redesignated a radar picket destroyer (DDR-829) on 18 March 1949.\n\nFollowing arrival Newport on 23 May 1949, the ship served in the North Atlantic for a year before getting underway from Norfolk on 3 May 1950 for the Mediterranean. Her 6th Fleet operations included simulated attack problems with submarines and other fleet readiness exercises. She visited ports of France, Italy, Turkey, Trieste, Greece, and Spain, cleared Gibraltar on 1 October, and returned to Newport on the 10th.\n\nRepairs in New York Naval Shipyard, convoy exercises to Bermuda, and tactics in the Virginia Cape area kept her busy until 20 March 1951 when she put to sea with a carrier striking force that reached Gibraltar on 6 April. She returned from this Mediterranean cruise to Newport on 4 October.\n\nAfter working on the east coast for almost a year, she stood out from Newport on 26 August 1952 with a fast carrier striking force built around and . This cruise took her to Greenock, Scotland, and thence into the Norwegian Sea as a unit of the NATO force. She visited ports of the British Isles before proceeding by way of Lisbon to the Mediterranean for another tour with the powerful 6th Fleet, returning Newport on 4 February 1953.\n\nOn 8 June 1953 \"Myles C. Fox\" left Norfolk on a midshipman cruise that included good will calls at Rio de Janeiro and Cartagena, Colombia. She debarked the midshipmen at the Naval Academy on 5 August and returned to Newport. For the next two years she operated on the east coast and in the Caribbean. She departed Newport on 2 May 1955 for the Mediterranean. After three months with the 6th Fleet, she returned to Newport on 25 August.\n\nDuring the ensuing years, \"Myles C. Fox\" continued this pattern of service, alternating operations on the east coast and in the Caribbean with 6th Fleet deployments. In 1961 she won the Battle Efficiency \"E\", and in 1964 her home port was changed to Boston. That year the ship underwent FRAM I overhaul and modernization, and she was redesignated DD-829 on 1 April.\n\nFollowing her FRAM I overhaul, on 1 July 1965, Fox experienced a catastrophic fire in Radio Central. After repairs at the Boston Naval Shipyard, in June 1965 the Fox was dispatched to help support U.S. efforts to oppose a Cuban led insurgency in the Dominican Republic. The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was authorized as recognition for this Cold War campaign. On 9 August 1965, Fox deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for operations with the Sixth Fleet\n\nOn 6 March 1966, Fox was assigned to the Gemini 8 recovery team and stationed in the eastern Atlantic. While off the coast of Africa, she sped to the aid of Swedish freighter M/V \"Palma\" which was on fire. For three days firefighting teams battled the blaze before and arrived to lend a hand. The combined efforts of these U.S. Navy ships finally extinguished the flames, and \"Palma\" resumed steaming under her own power.\n\nAfter DASH qualifications off the Virginia Capes, the destroyer operated along the east coast until getting underway for the Far East on 4 October. Steaming via the Panama Canal, Hawaii, Japan, and the Philippines, the destroyer arrived off the coast of North Vietnam on 7 January 1967. While in the war zone \"Myles C. Fox\" delivered numerous fire support missions against enemy ground forces and installations. Her guns also damaged three enemy junks and two sampans. She headed home on the second half of a round-the-world cruise 20 February and arrived Newport from Suez and Gibraltar 25 April.\n\n\"Myles C. Fox\" operated on the east coast and in the Caribbean during most of 1967. She entered Boston Naval Shipyard on 26 September for overhaul through 1 January 1968.\n\nThe ship entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a regular overhaul on 26 Dec 1967 where the DASH capability was removed. Upon completion of overhaul in Jan 1968, the ship proceeded to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for refresher training. Upon completion she deployed to the Mediterranean and returned to the US in Oct 1968. In Jan 1969 the ship participated in the Apollo 11 program by taking the astronaut quarantine trailer on sea trials from Norfolk, Virginia. The trailer was used by the astronauts in July 1969 when they returned from the moon. In March she deployed to the Indian Ocean visiting ports in Africa, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Iran, etc., returning in Sept 1969.\n\nThe ship returned to Cuba in the spring of 1970. She completed training in June and after return to Newport she departed for participation in UNITAS XI in South American waters. For the next 5.5 months extensive training was conducted with South American navies of Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, and Columbia. The \noperation was capped by a return passage through the Panama canal. The ship returned to Newport on Dec 1970. On 12 March 1971 the Myles C. Fox entered the Boston Naval \nShipyard for her regular overhaul period. After overhaul completion the ship departed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for refresher training. After completion and return to Newport the ship departed for the Middle East on 7 Jan 1972 where she operated for 4 months. On 2 May 1972 the ship arrived off the coast of Viet Nam and for the next 2 \nmonths provided naval gunfire support in the south and spearheaded surface strikes into North Vietnamese waters. On 10 Aug the ship was awarded its second Battle Efficiency \"E\" and on 14 Aug returned to Newport.\n\nIn June 1973 the ship completed a fuel oil conversion to navy distillate and in July was transferred to the Naval Reserve Force(NRF), changing homeport to Brooklyn, NY. During the period 1973–1979 the mission of the Fox was that of training the Naval Reserve component of the Navy. In Feb 1978 the ship departed Brooklyn for selected refresher training in Cuba. Upon completion in March she returned to Brooklyn and during that time was assigned numerous duties with elements of the second fleet.\n\n\"Myles C. Fox\" was decommissioned on 1 October 1979 after serving 34½ years. She was sold to Greece in 1980 and cannibalized for spare parts; the ship was scrapped in 2003.\n\n\n"}

It is operated by News 106 Limited, a subsidiary of Denis O'Brien's Communicorp, and broadcasts under a sound broadcasting contract with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.\n\nThe station is a \"quasi-national\" (covering most, but not all of the state) station as of 29 September 2006, previously having been an Independent Local Radio station with a franchise for Dublin.\n\nThe station is the only commercial radio station in Ireland to take on an exclusively news based format. News is broadcast every hour. The station's flagship morning programme is \"Newstalk Breakfast\", presented, inter alia, by Shane Coleman, Paul Williams and Alan Quinlan with Vincent Wall presenting business coverage.\n\nFrom January 2009 to December 2009, Newstalk recorded a national weekday reach of 8% and a market share of 4%, in the Dublin region Newstalk had a reach of 12% share of audience, in Cork Newstalk's reach was 8%,while in the rest of the country Newstalk's share was 6%.\n\nIn 1999 the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) invited applications for a number of new Dublin radio services, expanding on the then duopoly of 98FM and FM104. One was for a speech-based radio service. The Independent Local Radio (ILR) national news provider Independent Network News, was one of two applicants for this licence, and its applicant company, News 106, was awarded the franchise. However, before the station even went on air, several ILR companies decided that they did not want to be part of the venture, and the station's shareholding was restructured, with at launch, 98FM, FM104, Clare FM, Carlow Kildare Radio, LMFM, East Coast Radio, South East Radio and WLR FM, along with Setanta, being the shareholders in the company.\n\nThe station first went on air (under its original name NewsTalk 106) on 9 April 2002, with David McWilliams the first presenter. In its original format, it offered \"Twenty-Twenty News\", every twenty minutes. The first 20/20 news bulletins were presented by several newsreaders including Eimear Lowe, James Healy, Dyane Connor, Dimitri O'Donnell, Sean Archibald and Abigail Reilly. In September 2004 the news service was reduced to every thirty minutes (\"News 30\") along with a revamped news team to replace the original journalists who had left the station by this stage. In Summer 2004, the station signed Eamon Dunphy, dropping David McWilliams, resulting in controversy. In 2004, FM104 was forced to sell its stake as a condition of its takeover by Scottish Radio Holdings. This meant that Communicorp was able to take majority control of the station. Setanta and Hyper Trust remained as minority shareholders.\n\nIn 2005, Elaine Geraghty, the original co-presenter of the breakfast time programme on 98FM, was appointed Chief Executive. On 22 May 2006, the BCI announced that its new \"quasi-national\" speech-based contract was being awarded to Newstalk, who retained their 106 MHz frequency in Dublin while surrendering its Dublin ILR licence. Newstalk were the sole application for the licence. It began quasi-national broadcasts on 29 September 2006. The media expressed concern at its relative lack of star names and proliferation of unknowns, though noted the presence of George Hook and Seán Moncrieff.\n\nIn 2009, Ms Geraghty resigned as CEO and Frank Cronin, Setanta's board representative since 2002, was appointed CEO. Schedule changes included the appointment of former Minister for Agriculture Ivan Yates as breakfast presenter, Damien Kiberd to Lunchtime presenter and the re-engagement of Eamon Dunphy to Sunday Newspaper review programme presenter. This schedule together with the continuity of George Hook, \"Off the Ball\", Sean Moncrieff and Tom Dunne has driven the station to new heights of daily listenership and standing. The station now reaches 305,000 (JNLR February 2012) people daily, the fastest growing adult station in Ireland.\n\nThe rugby pundit, George Hook who presented the daily drive time show \"Right Hook\", retired in 2014, he returned to present \"High Noon\". He was suspended in September 2017 following comments he made on rape.\n\nDuring 2006 Newstalk were licensed to extend their coverage area to about 97% of Ireland. These \"quasi-national\" broadcasts began on 29 September 2006 (the sole official Independent National Radio station remains 100–102 Today FM).\n\nNewstalk is primarily known as being a Radio station; however, \"Newstalk\" is also the provider of the only National Radio Newswire in Ireland. Newstalk provides 'rip and read' copy and audio 24/7, and also provides a live stream of audio Newsreading every hour. The latter is used mostly by local radio stations after 7p.m. across Ireland.\n\n"}

The village has a population of 2,571 (2011), while Pećinci municipality has 19,675 inhabitants.\n\nIn Serbian, the village is known as \"Pećinci\" (Пећинци), in Croatian as \"Pećinci\", in Hungarian as \"Pecsince\", in German as \"Petschinzi\", in Slovak as \"Pečinci\", and in Rusyn as Печинци. Its name derived from the Serbian word \"peć/пећ\" (\"furnace\" in English), or \"petlja/петља\" (\"loop\" or \"noose\" in English). The name of the town in Serbian is in the plural, and therefore it is grammatically correct to refer to it as \"\"Pećinci are\"\" instead of \"\"Pećinci is\"\". A hypothetical singular version of the name would be \"Pećinac\".\n\nThe village was first time recorded by the sources in 1416. After that time, there were no other records about this settlement until 1702. The village was under Ottoman administration until the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), when it passed to Habsburg Monarchy. During Habsburg administration, it was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier. From 1848 to 1849, the village was part of Serbian Vojvodina, but was again included into Military Frontier in 1849. After abolishment of the frontier (in 1882), it was included into Syrmia County of Croatia-Slavonia, which was an autonomous kingdom within the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary. According to the 1910 census, the village had a Serb ethnic majority.\n\nIn 1918, the village first became part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, then part of the Kingdom of Serbia, and finally part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia County, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Syrmia oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, the village was occupied by the Axis Powers and was attached to Pavelić's Independent State of Croatia. Territory of present-day Pećinci municipality was an important center of partisan resistance movement and a partisan liberated territory was formed in this area during the war.\n\nAfter the war, the village became part of Vojvodina, an autonomous province of the Socialist Republic of Serbia and Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. Until 1960, villages of present-day Pećinci municipality were part of the municipalities of Ruma, Stara Pazova and Zemun (village of Pećinci itself was part of Zemun municipality). A separate municipality of Pećinci was formed in 1960 and the village of Pećinci was chosen to be the municipal center because of its favorable traffic position.\n\nAside from the village of Pećinci, municipality includes the following villages:\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality of Šid has 19,720 inhabitants.\n\nAll settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority.

It was said that she had been fired, but in the words of González herself, she actually resigned because of the alleged mistreatment she received from the production of the series.\n\nIn an interview, González defended her version of the events, explaining that at that moment in her career she could not afford an antagonistic role after having starred in other fictions. In her opinion, she was not going to endure any \"humiliation\" stating the following:\n\nThe actress also pointed out that during the filming she experienced \"unpleasant experiences\" and denounced that she was not treated properly, so she decided to give up the series. González assured that she was not fired for the production by stating:\n\nIn an infamous scene of the telenovela, the lead character Rosa García (played by Verónica Castro) throws noodles to her face, which was reported to be for many fans a symbol of the \"humiliation\" described by González. Her character was replaced by Felicia Mercado. In 1988 she participated on the films \"Pero sigo siendo el rey\" and \"Central camionera\" while she also returned to the telenovelas on \"Flor y canela\".

And this same year, she also made an appearance on a Plaza Sesamo short film entitled \"Plaza Sésamo: Los monstruos feos más bellos\" (Sesame Square: The most beautiful ugly monsters). In 2009, she appeared with a role on the psychological thriller series \"Mujeres asesinas\" and this same year, she also had a co-leading role on the telenovela \"Camaleones\", with this marking her last telenovela on the channel.\n\nIn 2010, González switched to TV Azteca, the second main Mexican broadcaster. She made her first appearance for the company during a program of the \"La Academia Bicentenario\". This same year, she appeared during the \"Mañanitas a la Virgen\" program, an special yearly transmission done by TV Azteca on December 12, in which different artists sing at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe celebration day.\n\nIn 2011, she had her first leading role for the company on the telenovela \"Cielo rojo\" by Eric Vonn, sharing credits with Regina Torné and Mauricio Islas. She also returned to films on the television film \"Poquita ropa\" (2011), starred by singer Ricardo Arjona.

In 2014, she had the leading role on the telenovela \"Las Bravo\", in which she shared credits one more time with actor Mauricio Islas.\n\nIn 2016, she returned with the leading role on the telenovela produced by Telemundo, \"Eva la trailera\". The telenovela and Telemundo were sued by Rolando Fernández, who accused them of plagiarism of his 1983 film Lola the Truck Driver. The lawsuit was ultimately won by Fernández. Despite this, the telenovela was retransmitted by Telemundo in 2019 following González's passing as a tribute in her memory.\nIn 2017, she returned with a recurring role on the telenovela \"3 familias\" she appeared one more time on the yearly \"Mañanitas a la Virgen\" program and filmed her last film entitled \"Un sentimiento honesto en el calabozo del olvido\". In 2019, González re-appeared as a judge on the fashion program of TV Azteca \"Este es mi estilo\", with this being her last work and television project.\n\nAs well as being an actress for multiple films and television productions, González was also an actress of multiple plays such as \"Los árboles mueren de pie\", \"Un día particular\", \"Magnolias de acero\", \"Buenas noches mamá\", \"Entre mujeres\", among others. Her most famous theater work was in the play \"Aventurera\" produced by Carmen Salinas for which she was the first actress to portray the lead character, Elena Tejero.\n\nGonzález had a daughter, Constanza (born 17 August 2004). Initially she did not disclose the father's name and decided to raise Constanza alone. In 2008, Mexican politician Santiago Creel recognized that he was Constanza's father. During an interview in August 2012, González shared that she had lost a baby previously without any further explanation by simply stating the following:\n\nShe kept an strong longtime friendship with Argentine-Mexican actress Christian Bach, who died on February 26, 2019, due to respiratory failure.

In April 2019, it was rumored that she had suffered a cancer relapse; which the actress denied, adducing a trip to Guatemala.\n\nOn 13 June 2019, González died of the disease. She was declared medically brain dead and was later taken off life support by her family at noon, passing away at the age of 54. Hours before her passing, the Mexican television daily morning program \"Hoy\" erroneously reported that she had already died, which was wrong since González's official hour of death was at 12:00 p.m. when her family decided to disconnect her, with this incident causing annoyance to her family. Also on 13 June, González's funeral was held at the Panteón Francés where she was accompanied by her family and famous colleagues of her acting career. On 14 June, her body was moved to the Jorge Negrete theatre where a tribute was held for her with the attendance of fans, friends and family. After the tribute, she was moved to the Parque Memorial Gayosso in Naucalpan de Juárez, where she was buried alongside her father.\n\n"}

It lay in the angle formed by the Omo and the Jimma Gibe Rivers; to the west lay the Kingdom of Jimma and to the south the Kingdom of Garo. Three mountains — Mount Bor Ama, Mount Azulu and Mount Toba — all distinguish the location of the former kingdom.\n\nAlthough one of the Sidamo kingdoms, until its conquest in 1894 Janjero was \"isolated, and had little to do with its neighbors, its rivers being very difficult to cross. Although first visited by Europeans in 1614, until the late 1950s this region remained poorly known to outsiders. As a result, its people were said to have preserved a number of \"customs so barbarious and strange that there cannot be any more so.\"\n\nSome of these alleged customs are as follows:\n\nJanjero is first mentioned in a victory song of Yeshaq I, as one of several states south of the Abay River that paid tribute in horses to the Emperor. The first kings of Janjero belonged to the Halmam Gama dynasty, which was ejected by the Mwa clan, who claimed to have come from the north.\n\nIn 1614, Father António Fernandes visited the kingdom while looking for a southern route to Malindi on the Indian Ocean. Father Fernandes met the king of Janjero, and found him \naccording to Custom in a fort of rail'd Tower, about six Yards high, liittle more or less, 7 Yards and a half over, as we shall see anon, and the Stairs up to it in the back Part. All the courtiers stood below, and he on the top of the Elevation, which was not unlike a Cart Wheel, sitting on a Carpet, and there it is he gives Audience, decides Controversies, and dispatches all Business. He was clad in a white Silk \"Indian\" Garment, and was himself as black as Cole, but had not the Features of a \"Cafre\".\n\nIn 1844, warriors of the Kingdom of Jimma defeated the army of Janjero, and the king of Janjero was taken prisoner. He regained his freedom in 1847, and resumed his struggle against his more powerful neighbor.\n\nJimma conquered part of Janjero in the 1880s. The rest of the kingdom was annexed in the reign of Menelik II in 1894, and its last king, Abba Bagibo, fled to the Gurage country, but eventually made his submission to Emperor Menelik. His son Abba Chabsa became a Christian, and adopted the name Gabra Madhen, and served the Ethiopian who held the fief.\n\nDuring the reorganization of the provinces in 1942, the former kingdom was absorbed to become part of the Kaffa Province. However, with the new constitution of 1995, the area Janjero once occupied became the Yem Special Woreda, which was added to the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region to form the enclave of the Region west of the Omo River.\n\n"}

This was the last in the long-running \"Road to …\" series and the only one not produced by Paramount Pictures, though references to the others in the series are made in the film and shown in Maurice Binder's opening title sequence.\n\nThe story is told in flashback as Diane (Joan Collins) explains to American Intelligence how transmissions from passengers picked up from a missile to the moon are by Americans rather than Russians.\n\nHarry Turner (Crosby) and Chester Babcock (Hope) are defrauding people in Calcutta by selling a \"Do-it-yourself interplanetary flight kit\" that ends up injuring Chester, giving him amnesia. An Indian doctor (Peter Sellers) says the only way for Chester's amnesia to be cured is through help from monks in a lamasery in Tibet.\n\nAt the airport, Chester mistakenly picks up a suitcase with a marking designed to be a point of contact between agents of a SPECTRE-type spy organization called \"The Third Echelon.\" Diane (Collins), a Third Echelon secret agent, is supposed to give plans of a Russian rocket fuel stolen by the Third Echelon to the man with the suitcase, who will be taking them to headquarters in British Hong Kong. She mistakenly thinks Chester is the contact.\n\nIn Tibet, the two make their way to the lamasery in \"Lost Horizon\" fashion. Not only do the lamas cure Chester, but they have a Tibetan tea leaf that gives super memory powers to those who consume it. Chester and Harry observe as great works of Western literature in the manner of \"Fahrenheit 451\" are committed to memory, one giggling lama (David Niven) memorizes \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\". The scheming Harry decides to steal a bottle to give Chester the power of photographic memory for lucrative nefarious purposes.\n\nReturning to Calcutta, followed by Diane, Harry has Chester test the results of the memory herb by memorizing the rocket formula that Diane placed in Chester's coat. Not knowing what it is, Harry destroys it after Chester has successfully memorized it. Diane arrives too late, but after seeing Chester recite the formula, she offers them $25,000 to meet her in Hong Kong. On the way to Hong Kong, an agent of the High Lama replaces the stolen Tibetan herbs with a similar bottle containing ordinary tea leaves.\n\nThe Third Echelon is seeking the fuel for its own spacecraft with an underwater launching pad in Hong Kong. The goal is to be the first on the moon, where a base is to be established to launch nuclear weapons against Earth and to bring survivors under the agency's control.\n\nWith a Russian launch to the moon carrying two apes imminent, the Third Echelon, which was going to emulate the Soviet achievement, decides to gain respect at the United Nations by launching two human astronauts, Chester and Harry, instead of apes. The two are used as guinea pigs (and fed with bananas) to test the capabilities of the spacecraft and the effects of spaceflight upon humans. The mission is successful, with moonlight bringing back Chester's photographic memory.\n\nDiane decides to leave the Third Echelon when she discovers that once her colleagues have extracted the final formula from Chester, they plan to dissect Chester and Harry to see the effects of space travel on their bodies. Diane helps the boys escape. They are pursued through Hong Kong, eventually leading Diane to the authorities. Chester and Harry happen to meet Dorothy Lamour at a nightclub where they are recaptured by the Third Echelon.\n\nChester, Harry and Diane all end up in a rocket bound for another planet. They think they're alone after landing, but they're not—Chester calls out, \"The Italians!\" as they are joined by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.\n\nFilming in England at Shepperton Studios, the regular \"Road\" picture stars Crosby and Hope returned for one last go, but the leading lady was now Joan Collins rather than Dorothy Lamour. Lamour did make a cameo appearance as herself late in the film. In her autobiography, Lamour wrote that Crosby thought her too old to be a leading lady (she was 48), while Hope refused to do the film without her. Her extended cameo that featured her singing with Hope and Crosby was a compromise. Other cameos are provided by David Niven, Peter Sellers, Roger Delgado, Jerry Colonna, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. In order to preserve the feel of the 1940s and '50s \"Road\" films, the movie was shot in black and white (even though the previous entry \"Road to Bali\" had been shot in color).\n\nThe name of Hope's character, \"Chester Babcock\", is an in-joke. Edward Chester Babcock was the real name of Hollywood composer Jimmy Van Heusen, whose work is featured in this and other \"Road\" pictures. The lamasery where Hope goes to restore his memory is reused from \"Black Narcissus\". Peter Sellers' appearance as an Indian physician involves extended interplay with Crosby and Hope.\n\nThe plot of the film (released 22 May 1962) involves espionage and space rockets predating \"Dr. No\" (released 5 October 1962) and the spy craze of the 1960s. Hope and Crosby are up against a SPECTRE type organization called \"The Third Echelon\" who have their own underwater secret headquarters and are led by Robert Morley with James Bond film regular Walter Gotell as \"Dr. Zorbb\" and Bob Simmons as an astronaut. The film's art director is another Bond film regular, Syd Cain.\n\nAlthough the movie features the same kind of antics and gags as previous episodes, with all characters trying their utmost to help each other, the film was not as well-received as its predecessors. Some critics felt that the 59-year-old Hope and Crosby couldn't pull off the part credibly at their age and that it was unfair for them to dump their old partner Lamour (with whom they had excellent screen chemistry) for the more youthful Collins. Others thought the decade-long gap since the last \"Road\" movie wrecked the momentum of the series and that Peter Sellers came off as more fresh and funny than the aging stars of the film.\n\nIn 1977, Sir Lew Grade had planned to reunite Hope, Crosby and Lamour in \"The Road to the Fountain of Youth\" for which Melville Shavelson had completed the script, but Crosby died before production. Crosby was rumored to have asked the writers for a Monty Python-esque script in order to keep the series fresh for 1970s audiences.\n\nThis is the only \"Road\" film to have its rights retained by the original producer/distributor (where all the previous films are now at the hands of other companies), although today Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (UA's sister studio) handles distribution and marketing on behalf of UA.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" welcomed it saying, \"inter alia\": \"Age may have withered somewhat the glossy hides of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and custom may have done a little something to stale their brand of vaudeville. But the old boys still come through nicely in another turn in the old “Road” act by which they were jointly elevated to international eminence about twenty years ago...But practically every moment spent with Bing and Bob is good for consecutive chuckles and frequent belly-deep guffaws. For their former travel agents, Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, who have not only written this picture but produced and directed it, have provided them with the gags and business to make for much humorous verbal give-and-take and an almost unending succession of crazy and corny contretemps.\"\n\n\"Variety\" was pretty positive too. \"The seventh “Road” comedy, after a lapse of seven years, should cause a seven-year itch among tab buyers to get in at the laughs. For they come thick and fast in this genial piece of nonsense. Perhaps the old formula creaks occasionally, but not enough to cause any disappointment while the zany situations and razor-edge wisecracks keep the whole affair bubbling happily. . . . The result is an amiable comedy which should please nostalgic customers and entice those who haven’t seen any of the previous “Road” pix...\"\n\nAll songs were written by Jimmy Van Heusen (music) and Sammy Cahn (lyrics) with the exception of \"Personality\".\n\n\nA soundtrack album was released by Liberty Records.\n\n\n\"The Road to Hong Kong\" was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Video on 1 April 2003 and on Region A Blu-ray by Olive Films on 17 February 2015.\n\n\n"}

It was first proved by Stephen Cole Kleene (1943). The name ' comes from the occurrence of an \"S\" with subscript \"n\" and superscript \"m\" in the original formulation of the theorem (see below).\n\nIn practical terms, the theorem says that for a given programming language and positive integers \"m\" and \"n\", there exists a particular algorithm that accepts as input the source code of a program with \"m\" + \"n\" free variables, together with \"m\" values.

The Gojeb River formed its northern border, beyond which lay the Gibe kingdoms; to the east the territory of the Konta and Kullo peoples lay between Kaffa and the Omo River; to the south numerous subgroups of the Gimira people, and to the west lay the Majangir people. The native language, also known as Kaffa, is one of the Omotic group of languages.\n\nKaffa was divided into four sub-groups, who spoke a common language Kefficho, one of the Gonga/Kefoid group of Omotic languages; a number of groups of foreigners, Ethiopian Muslim traders and members of the Ethiopian Church, also lived in the kingdom. There were a number of groups of people, \"but with the status of submerged status\", who also lived in the kingdom; these included the \"Manjo\", or hunters; the \"Manne\", or leatherworkers; and the \"Qemmo\", or blacksmiths. The \"Manjo\" even had their own king, appointed by the King of Kaffa, and were given the duties of guarding the royal compounds and the gates of the kingdom. The kingdom was overrun and conquered in 1897, and was eventually annexed by Ethiopia.\n\nThe land where this former kingdom lay is in the southern parts of the Ethiopian Highlands with stretches of forest. The mountainous land is very fertile, capable of three harvests a year.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kaffa was founded c.1390 by Minjo, who according to oral tradition ousted the Mato dynasty of 32 kings. However, his informants told Amnon Orent, \"no one remembers the name of a single one.\" The first capital Bonga was either founded or captured by Bon-noghe; it was later replaced by Anderaccha, but Bonga retained its importance.\n\nDuring the 16th century, all of the territories north of the Gojeb River were lost to the Oromo migrations. Also in the later 16th century, the Emperor of Ethiopia Sarsa Dengel convinced the kingdom to officially accept Christianity as its state religion. As a result, the church of St. George was dedicated at Baha; the building preserved a tabot bearing the name of Emperor Sarsa Dengel. Over the following centuries the influence of the Ethiopian government grew weak, and Christianity more or less disappeared, although the church of St. George was used as a \"male house of ritual of George\" until late in the 19th century when Christian practices were reintroduced.\n\nBeginning with Gali Ginocho (1675–1710), the kings of Kaffa began to expand the borders of their kingdom, annexing the neighboring small Gimira states of She, Benesho and Majango. The neighboring state of the Welayta came under their control in the reign of Tato Shagi Sherocho (1775–1795), who extended the boundaries of his kingdom as far as the Omo to the southeast and almost to the confluence of the Omo and the Denchya to the south. It was during the reign of King Hoti Gaocho (1798–1821), that the territory of the Kaffa kings reached its maximum. According to Orent, the traditions of the Kaffa people relate that he ruled far and wide, conquering wherever he went, even as far afield as Wolleta and Kambaata. \"To this day,\" concludes Orent, \"some people still talk about the time that their ancestors defeated all their enemies and sat at the foot of a famous tree in Wolliso and decided not to go farther into Shoa province.\"\n\nThe last Kaffa king, Gaki Sherocho, resisted for months the combined armies of Wolde Giyorgis, Ras Damisse, and King Abba Jifar II of Jimma, until he was captured 11 September 1897, and was first sent to Ankober, then to Addis Ababa. Kaffa was then held as a fief by Wolde Giyogis until 1914. During his visit to Kaffa in 1897, Alexander Bulatovich had the opportunity to study the culture of the inhabitants, describing them in his book \"With the Armies of Menelik II, emperor of Ethiopia\", identifying a number of practices in common with the more familiar Amhara people.\n\nThe inhabitants suffered greatly from slave-raiding during the de facto rule of Lij Iyasu, and the region almost became uninhabited. During the reorganization of the provinces in 1942, the former kingdom was enlarged by the addition of a number of other kingdoms from the Gibe region to become Kaffa Province.\n\nIn Kaffa, Maria Theresa thalers (MT) and salt blocks called \"amoleh\" were used as currency (as in the rest of Ethiopia) as late as 1905, which circulated at a rate of four or five \"amolehs\" to 1 MT.\n\nThe economy was based on exports of gold, civet oil, and slaves. Crops grown included coffee and cotton. However, according to Richard Pankhurst, the amount of coffee exported was never large: he cites an estimate for its production in the 1880s at 50,000 to 60,000 kilograms a year. Livestock was raised, and honeybees kept in barrels (called \"gendo\") which were hung in trees.\n\n\n"}

Generations of Japanese historians, linguists, and archeologists have debated where Yamatai-koku was located and whether it was related to the later .\n\nThe oldest accounts of Yamatai are found in the official Chinese dynastic Twenty-Four Histories for the 1st- and 2nd-century Eastern Han dynasty, the 3rd-century Wei kingdom, and the 6th-century Sui dynasty.\n\nThe c. 297 AD \"Records of Wèi\" (), which is part of the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" (), first mentions the country \"Yamatai\" (\"Yémǎtái\" (邪馬臺)) written as \"Yamaichi\" (\"Yémǎyī\" (邪馬壹)).\n\nMost \"Wei Zhi\" commentators accept the \"Yémǎtái\" (邪馬臺) transcription in later texts and dismiss this original word \"yi\" \"one\" (the anti-forgery character variant for \"one\") as a miscopy, or perhaps a naming taboo avoidance, of \"tai\" \"platform; terrace.\" This history describes ancient Wa based upon detailed reports of 3rd-century Chinese envoys who traveled throughout the Japanese archipelago:Going south by water for twenty days, one comes to the country of Toma, where the official is called \"mimi\" and his lieutenant, \"miminari\". Here there are about fifty thousand households. Then going toward the south, one arrives at the country of Yamadai, where a Queen holds her court. [This journey] takes ten days by water and one month by land. Among the officials there are the \"ikima\" and, next in rank, the \"mimasho\"; then the \"mimagushi\", then the \"nakato\". There are probably more than seventy thousands households. (115, tr. Tsunoda 1951:9) \n\nThe \"Wei Zhi\" also records that in 238 AD, Queen Himiko sent an envoy to the court of Wei emperor Cao Rui, who responded favorably:\nWe confer upon you, therefore, the title 'Queen of Wa Friendly to Wei', together with the decoration of the gold seal with purple ribbon. …As a special gift, we bestow upon you three pieces of blue brocade with interwoven characters, five pieces of tapestry with delicate floral designs, fifty lengths of white silk, eight taels of gold, two swords five feet long, one hundred bronze mirrors, and fifty catties each of jade and of red beads. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:14-15)\n\nThe ca. 432 CE \"Book of the Later Han\" () says the Wa kings lived in the country of Yamatai ():The Wa dwell on mountainous islands southeast of Han [Korea] in the middle of the ocean, forming more than one hundred communities. From the time of the overthrow of Chaoxian [northern Korea] by Emperor Wu (B.C. 140-87), nearly thirty of these communities have held intercourse with the Han [dynasty] court by envoys or scribes. Each community has its king, whose office is hereditary. The King of Great Wa [Yamato] resides in the country of Yamadai. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:1)\n\nThe \"Book of Sui\" (), finished in 636 CE, records changing the capital's name from \"Yamadai\" () to \"Yamato\" ():Wa is situated in the middle of the great ocean southeast of Baekje and Silla, three thousand \"li\" away by water and land. The people dwell on mountainous islands. …The capital is Yamato, known in the Wei history as Yamadai. The old records say that it is altogether twelve thousand \"li\" distant from the borders of Lelang and Daifang prefectures, and is situated east of Kuaiji and close to Dan'er. (81, tr. Tsunoda 1951:28)\n\nThe first Japanese books were mainly written with the \"Man'yōgana\" system, a rebus-like transcription that phonetically uses kanji \"Chinese characters\" to represent Japanese phonemes. For instance, using Chinese \"jiā\" ( \"add\"), which was pronounced \"ka\" in Japanese, to write the Japanese mora \"ka\". Irregularities within this awkward system led Japanese scribes to develop phonetically regular syllabaries. In many cases, the new kana were graphic simplifications of Chinese characters. For instance, \"ka\" is written in hiragana and in katakana, both of which derive from the \"Man'yōgana\" 加 character.\n\nThe c. 712 \"Kojiki\" (古事記 \"Records of Ancient Matters\") is the oldest extant book written in Japan. The \"Birth of the Eight Islands\" section phonetically transcribes \"Yamato\" as what would be in Modern Standard Chinese \"Yèmádēng\" (夜麻登). The \"Kojiki\" records the Shintoist creation myth that the god \"Izanagi\" and the goddess \"Izanami\" gave birth to the \"Ōyashima\" (大八州 \"Eight Great Islands\") of Japan, the last of which was Yamato:Next they gave birth to Great-Yamato-the-Luxuriant-Island-of-the-Dragon-Fly, another name for which is Heavenly-August-Sky-Luxuriant-Dragon-Fly-Lord-Youth. The name of \"Land-of-the-Eight-Great-Islands\" therefore originated in these eight islands having been born first. (tr. Chamberlain 1919:23)\nChamberlain (1919:27) notes this poetic name \"Island of the Dragon-fly\" is associated with legendary Emperor Jimmu, who was honorifically named with Yamato as \"Kamu-yamato Iware-biko.\"\n\nThe 720 \"Nihon Shoki\" (日本書紀 \"Chronicles of Japan\") also transcribes \"Yamato\" with the Chinese characters \"Yèmádēng\" (耶麻騰). In this version of the Eight Great Islands myth, \"Yamato\" is born second instead of eighth:Now when the time of birth arrived, first of all the island of Ahaji was reckoned as the placenta, and their minds took no pleasure in it. Therefore it received the name of Ahaji no Shima. Next there was produced the island of Oho-yamato no Toyo-aki-tsu-shima. (tr. Aston 1924 1:13)\nThe translator Aston notes a literal meaning of \"Rich-harvest (or autumn)-of-island\" (\"i.e.\" \"Island of Bountiful Harvests\" or \"Island of Bountiful Autumn\").\n\nThe c. 600-759 \"Man'yōshū\" (万葉集 \"Myriad Leaves Collection\") transcribes \"Yamato\" as \"yama\" 山 \"mountain\" plus \"tö\" 蹟 \"footprint; track; trace\". Take for example, the first poem in the book, allegedly written by Emperor Yūryaku:O maiden with a basket, a pretty basket, with a scoop, a pretty scoop, maiden picking greens on this hillside: I want to ask about your house; I want to be told your name. In the sky-filling land of Yamato it is I who rule everyone it is I who rule everywhere, and so I think you will tell me where you live, what you are called. (tr. McCullough 1985:6) \nCommentators gloss this 山蹟乃國 as \"Yamato no kuni\" 大和の国 \"country of Yamato\". The usual Japanese reading of 山蹟 would be \"sanseki\" in Sino-Japanese \"on'yomi\" (from Chinese \"shanji\") or \"yama'ato\" in native \"kun'yomi\".\n\nModern Japanese \"Yamato\" (大和) descends from Old Japanese \"Yamatö\" or \"Yamato\", which has been associated with \"Yamatai\". The latter umlaut or subscript diacritics distinguish two vocalic types within the proposed eight vowels of Nara period (710-794) Old Japanese (\"a\", \"i\", \"ï\", \"u\", \"e\", ë, \"o\", and \"ö\", see Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai), which merged into the five Modern ones (\"a\", \"i\", \"u\", \"e\", and \"o\").\n\nDuring the Kofun period (250-538) when \"kanji\" were first used in Japan, \"Yamatö\" was written with the \"ateji\" 倭 for \"Wa\" \"Japan\". During the Asuka period (538-710) when Japanese place names were standardized into two-character compounds, \"Yamato\" was changed to 大倭 with a (\"big; great\") prefix.\n\nFollowing the ca. 757 graphic substitution of 和 for 倭, it was written 大和 \"great harmony,\" using the Classical Chinese expression \"dàhé\" 大和 (e.g., \"Yijing\" 1, tr. Wilhelm 1967:371: \"each thing receives its true nature and destiny and comes into permanent accord with the Great Harmony.\")\n\nThe early Japanese texts above give three transcriptions of \"Yamato\": 夜麻登 (\"Kojiki\"), 耶麻騰 (\"Nihon Shoki\"), and 山蹟 (\"Man'yōshū\"). The \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" use Sino-Japanese \"on'yomi\" readings of \"ya\" \"night\" or \"ya\" or \"ja\" (an interrogative sentence-final particle in Chinese), \"ma\" or \"ba\" \"hemp\", and \"tō\" or \"to\" \"rise; mount\" or \"tō\" \"fly; gallop\". In contrast, the \"Man'yōshū\" uses Japanese \"kun'yomi\" readings of \"yama\" \"mountain\" and \"to\" < \"tö\" or \"ato\" \"track; trace\".\n\nThe early Chinese histories above give three transcriptions of \"Yamatai\": 邪馬壹 (\"Wei Zhi\"), 邪馬臺 (\"Hou Han Shu\"), and 邪摩堆 (\"Sui Shu\"). The first syllable is consistently written with \"yé\" \"a place name\", which was used as a jiajie graphic-loan character for \"yé\" \"interrogative sentence-final particle\" and \"xié\" 邪 \"evil; depraved\". The second is written with \"mǎ\" \"horse\" or \"mó\" \"rub; friction\". The third syllable of \"Yamatai\" is written \"yī\" or \"ichi\" \"faithful, committed; financial form of , one\", \"tái\" or \"platform; terrace\" (cf. \"Taiwan\" 臺灣) or \"duī\" \"pile; heap\". Concerning the transcriptional difference between \"Yamaichi\" 邪馬壹 in the \"Wei Zhi\" and \"Yamadai\" or \"Yamatai\" 邪馬臺 in the \"Hou Han Shu\", Hong (1994:248-9) cites that \"Yamaichi\" was correct. Chen Shou, author of the ca. 297 \"Wei Zhi\", was writing about recent history based on personal observations; Fan Ye, author of the ca. 432 \"Hou Han Shu\", was writing about earlier events based on written sources. Hong says the \"San Guo Zhi\" uses \"ichi\" 壹 86 times and \"dai\" 臺 56 times, without confusing them.\nDuring the Wei period, \"dai\" was one of their most sacred words, implying a religious-political sanctuary or the emperor's palace. The characters \"ya\" 邪 and \"ma\" 馬 mean \"nasty\" and \"horse\", reflecting the contempt Chinese felt for a barbarian country, and it is most unlikely that Chen Shou would have used a sacred word after these two characters. It is equally unlikely that a copyist could have confused the characters, because in their old form they do not look nearly as similar as in their modern printed form. Yamadai was Fan Yeh’s creation. (1994:249) \nHe additionally cites Furuta that the \"Wei Zhi\", \"Hou Han Shu\", and \"Xin Tang Shu\" histories use at least 10 Chinese characters to transcribe Japanese \"to\", but \"dai\" 臺 is not one of them.\n\nIn historical Chinese phonology, these Modern Chinese pronunciations differ considerably with the original 3rd-7th century transcriptions from a transitional period between Archaic or Old Chinese and Ancient or Middle Chinese. The table below contrasts Modern pronunciations (in Pinyin) with differing reconstructions of Early Middle Chinese (Edwin G. Pulleyblank 1991), \"Archaic\" Chinese (Bernhard Karlgren 1957), and Middle Chinese (William H. Baxter 1992). Note that Karlgren's \"Archaic\" is equivalent with \"Middle\" Chinese, and his \"yod\" palatal approximant \"\" (which some browsers cannot display) is replaced with the customary \"j\".\n\nRoy Andrew Miller describes the phonological gap between these Middle Chinese reconstructions and the Old Japanese \"Yamatö\".\nThe \"Wei chih\" account of the Wo people is chiefly concerned with a kingdom which it calls Yeh-ma-t'ai, Middle Chinese\" i̯a-ma-t'ḁ̂i\", which inevitably seems to be a transcription of some early linguistic form allied with the word Yamato. The phonology of this identification raises problems which after generations of study have yet to be settled. The final \"-ḁ̂i\" of the Middle Chinese form seems to be a transcription of some early form not otherwise recorded for the final \"-ö\" of Yamato. (1967:17-18) \n\nWhile most scholars interpret 邪馬臺 as a transcription of pre-Old Japanese \"yamatai\", Miyake (2003:41) cites Alexander Vovin that Late Old Chinese \"ʑ(h)a maaʳq dhəə\" 邪馬臺 represents a pre-Old Japanese form of Old Japanese \"yamato\" (*\"yamatə\"). Tōdō Akiyasu reconstructs two pronunciations for 䑓 – \"dai\" < Middle \"dǝi\" < Old *\"dǝg\" and \"yi\" < \"yiei\" < *\"d̥iǝg\" – and reads 邪馬臺 as \"Yamaikoku\".\n\nThe etymology of \"Yamato\", like those of many Japanese words, remains uncertain. While scholars generally agree that \"Yama-\" signifies Japan's numerous \"yama\" 山 \"mountains\", they disagree whether -\"to\" < -\"tö\" signifies 跡 \"track; trace\", 門 \"gate; door\", 戸 \"door\", 都 \"city; capital\", or perhaps \"tokoro\" 所 \"place\".\n\nThe location of Yamatai-koku is one of the most contentious topics in Japanese history. Generations of historians have debated \"the Yamatai controversy\" and have hypothesized numerous localities, some of which are fanciful like Okinawa (Farris 1998:245). General consensus centers around two likely locations of Yamatai, either northern Kyūshū or Yamato Province in the Kinki region of central Honshū. Imamura describes the controversy.\nThe question of whether the Yamatai Kingdom was located in northern Kyushu or central Kinki prompted the greatest debate over the ancient history of Japan. This debate originated from a puzzling account of the itinerary from Korea to Yamatai in \"Wei-shu\". The northern Kyushu theory doubts the description of distance and the central Kinki theory the direction. This has been a continuing debate over the past 200 years, involving not only professional historians, archeologists and ethnologists, but also many amateurs, and thousands of books and papers have been published. (1996:188) \n\nThe location of ancient Yamatai-koku and its relation with the subsequent Kofun-era Yamato polity remains uncertain. In 1989, archeologists discovered a giant Yayoi-era complex at the Yoshinogari site in Saga Prefecture, which was thought to be a possible candidate for the location of Yamatai. While some scholars, most notably Seijo University historian Takehiko Yoshida, interpret Yoshinogari as evidence for the Kyūshū Theory, many others support the Kinki Theory based on Yoshinogari clay vessels and the early development of Kofun (Saeki 2006).\n\nThe recent archeological discovery of a large stilt house suggests that Yamatai-koku was located near Makimuku in Sakurai, Nara (Anno. 2009).\n\n\n"}

Built by Khedive Ismail, to become the official government headquarters instead of the Citadel of Cairo (which had been the centre of Egyptian government since the Middle Ages), this palace was used as well for official events and ceremonies.\n\nConstruction started in 1863 and continued for 10 years and the palace was officially inaugurated in 1874. Erected on an area of 24 feddans, the palace was designed by the French architect Léon Rousseau along with a large number of Egyptian, Italian, French and Turkish decorators. However, the palace’s garden was added in 1921 by Sultan Fuad I on an area of 20 feddans. The cost of building the palace reached 700,000 Egyptian pounds in addition to 2 million pounds for its furnishing. Between four palaces, King Fuad spent more than 18 million French francs with just one Parisian furniture manufacturer \"Linke & Cie\". More money was also spent on the palace’s alteration, preservation and maintenance by consecutive rulers. The palace has 500 suites.\n\nThe palace today is a museum, located in the Old Cairo district of Abdeen. The upper floors (the former living quarters of the royal family) are reserved for visiting foreign dignitaries. The lower floors contain the Silver Museum, the Arms Museum, the Royal Family Museum, and the Presidential Gifts Museum. A new museum, the Historical Documents Museum, was opened in January 2005. Among other documents, it contains the Imperial Ottoman \"firman\", or decree, which established the rule of Muhammad Ali and his family, and a certificate for the Order of the Iron Crown, from the short-lived South American Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia.\n\n\n"}

The name was changed on the 60th anniversary of Soviet victory to better reflect the theme of the station.

The Mononobe were opposed to the spread of Buddhism, partly on religious grounds, claiming that the local deities would be offended by the worshiping of foreign deities, but also as the result of feelings of conservatism and a degree of xenophobia. The Nakatomi clan, ancestors of the Fujiwara, were also Shinto ritualists allied with the Mononobe in opposition to Buddhism.\n\nThe Mononobe, like many other major families of the time, were something of a corporation or guild in addition to being a proper family by blood-relation. While the only members of the clan to appear in any significant way in the historical record were statesmen, the clan as a whole was known as the Corporation of Arms or Armorers.\n\nThe Mononobe were said to have been descended from Nigihayahi no Mikoto, (饒速日命), a legendary figure who is said to have ruled Yamato before the conquest of Emperor Jimmu. His descendant Mononobe no Toochine (物部十千根), known as the founder of the clan, was given Isonokami Shrine by the younger sister of Prince Inishiki (the eldest son of Emperor Suinin). He then began using the name Mononobe.\n\nIn the 6th century, a number of violent clashes erupted between the Mononobe and the Soga clan. According to the Nihon Shoki, one particularly important conflict occurred after the Emperor Yōmei died after a very short reign.

He was together a pillar of the establishment and a key figure of the new trends of his time, the 'true view painting'. Gim Hong-do was an exceptional artist in every field of traditional painting, even if he is mostly remembered nowadays for his depictions of the everyday life of ordinary people, in a manner analogous to the Dutch Masters.\n\nDanwon was a member of the Gimhae Gim clan. He grew up in present-day Ansan, South Korea.\nAt the age of 7, Gim Hong-do studied under the renowned master Pyoam Kang Se-hwang, who was then living in seclusion in Ansan. In 1766, at the age of 21, on the recommendation of Kang Sehwang, he entered the royal service as a member (hwawon) of the Dohwaseo, the official painters of the Joseon court. In 1771, he painted the portrait of the Royal Heir (the future King Jeongjo). In 1773, he assisted Byeon Sang-byeok when painting the Royal Portrait of King Yeongjo (1694–1724–1776).\n\nIn 1776, he painted the \"Nineteen Taoist Immortals\", that skyrocketed his reputation as a painter. At the same time, the new instated King Jeongjo (1752–1776–1800) commissioned him for many institutional paintings.\n\nHe died in loneliness and poverty, though the circumstances, and even the year are unknown. Sources are guessing 1806?, circa 1810, after 1814.\n\nDanwon is remembered today as one of the \"Three Wons,\" together with Hyewon and Owon. He is also often joined to Owon and the 15th-century painter An Gyeon as one of Joseon's three greatest painters.\n\nThe city of Ansan, where he spent his youth and learned his craft, has memorialized him in many ways. The district of Danwon-gu is named after him, as is Ansan's annual \"Danwon Art Festival.\" Many public places have been designed in imitation of his works.\n\nVarious sources have various opinions about what could be a 'top ten' list for Gim Hong-do.

They were an innovative design based on the experience of three years of fighting in the Battle of the Atlantic and attendant technological advances. Some shipyards had trouble building these larger ships, which led to widespread use of the Castle-class corvette, introduced around the same time.\n\nThe Lochs were based upon the hull of the preceding with increased sheer and flare to improve seakeeping and modified to suit it to mass pre-fabrication, with sections riveted or welded together at the shipyard. Accordingly, as many curves as possible were eliminated, producing a noticeable kink in the main deck where the increased sheer forwards met the level abreast the bridge.\n\nThe fighting capability of the Loch class was a great jump forward, being based around the new Squid ahead-throwing A/S mortar. Previously, escorts had attacked with depth charges, requiring the attacking vessel to pass over the submerged submarine and drop warheads over the stern. Consequently, the ahead-looking ASDIC (sonar) set lost contact at the vital moment before the weapons were launched, allowing a skilled submarine commander to take successful evasive action. Squid, however, lobbed three , 390 pound warheads up to ahead of the launching vessel falling in a triangular pattern with sides of . As the clockwork fuses detonated the warheads at a depth determined by the ships' ASDIC set, the Squid therefore attacked in full ASDIC contact for greater accuracy and lethality. Two mortars were carried, with the bombs set to explode at different depths in order to create a convergent pressure wave to crush the hull of a submarine. The first successful \"kill\" was by on 31 July 1944, sinking the . Such was the utility of Squid that depth charge carriage was reduced to only 15, with a single rack and a pair of throwers being carried at the stern, resulting in a clear quarterdeck compared to the eight throwers, two racks and stowage for 100 plus charges in the Rivers.\n\nThe weapons outfit was completed with a single QF Mark V gun forwards. An oversight in the River design had been to place the gun in the favourable position forward on the shelter deck, with the ahead throwing Hedgehog on the main deck, exposed to the worst of the seas breaking over the fo'c'sle, consequently this was reversed in the Lochs; the Squids being on the shelter deck behind protective bulwarks. For anti-aircraft (A/A) defence, a quadruple mounting Mark VII QF 2-pounder was shipped aft along with up to 12 20 mm Oerlikon guns, in 2 twin powered mounts Mark V in the bridge wings and 8 single pedestal mounts Mark III. , \"Loch Craggie\", \"Loch Eck\", \"Loch Glendhu\", and the South African Navy ships HMSAS \"Good Hope\", \"Natal\" and \"Transvaal\" carried single Bofors 40 mm gun mounts in lieu of the twin Oerlikons.\n\nIn addition to the new weaponry, the Lochs also carried new sensors, in the form of Radar Type 277. This set utilised the cavity magnetron to transmit on centimetric wavelengths for target indication purposes, excelling at picking out small targets such as a submarine periscope or snorkel from the surface clutter. The increased weight of the stabilised antenna array and the carriage of HF/DF at the masthead meant that a lattice mast was stepped in lieu of the traditional tripod or pole. Some vessels completed with Radar Type 271 or 272 and the associated \"lantern\" radome until Type 277 became available. ASDIC Type 144 was carried for search and attack functions with Type 147B used for depth finding.\n\nAs with the previous wartime escort designs, mercantile machinery was adopted to speed construction, with a pair of 4-cylinder vertical triple-expansion reciprocating engines. \"Loch Arkaig\" and \"Loch Tralaig\" were fitted with Parsons single reduction steam turbines to establish the feasibility of such an installation, but it was not possible to provide enough sets of turbines for all vessels. One advantage of the use of mercantile machinery was that it was instantly familiar to the mainly reservist and volunteer (RNR and RNVR) crews who manned these ships.\n\nOf the one hundred and ten vessels ordered, twenty-eight were built as frigates, entering service from 1944. Another two – \"Loch Assynt\" and \"Loch Torridon\" – were converted while building and completed as Coastal Forces Depot Ships, being renamed and . Due to a need in 1944 for a version fitted as anti-aircraft vessels with the British Pacific Fleet, twenty-six units were authorised for completion to a modified design labelled the and were renamed. A further fifty-four Loch-class vessels were cancelled in 1945.\n\nOf the twenty-eight Loch-class frigates completed as such, \"Loch Achanalt\", \"Loch Alvie\" and \"Loch Morlich\" were transferred to Canada in 1943 but retained their Royal Navy names and were returned after the war; a fourth ship – \"Loch Fionn\" – was also earmarked for transfer but was retained by the Royal Navy as a Bay-class frigate. \"Loch Ard\", \"Loch Boisdale\" and \"Loch Cree\" were transferred to South Africa as \"Transvaal\", \"Good Hope\" and \"Natal\" respectively on completion. In 1948, six vessels, including two of the ex-Royal Canadian Navy trio, were refitted from reserve and transferred to New Zealand. During the Korean War, the Royal Navy reactivated several vessels and transferred them to the Mediterranean where they released s for war duties. In 1964 \"Loch Insh\" was transferred to Malaysia.\n\n\"Loch Assynt\" and \"Loch Torridon\" were modified whilst under construction to depot ships for coastal forces, armed with a twin QF Mark XVI on a single mounting Mark XIX forward and six single 20 mm Oerlikons. With the war in the Atlantic won by 1944, and a need forecast for additional fleet A/A escorts for the Royal Navy's increased Far Eastern commitments, twenty-six Loch class were redesigned and renamed (of which nineteen were completed) as Bay-class anti-aircraft frigates.\n\nIn 1953, seven vessels were modernised; \"Loch Alvie\", \"Loch Fada\", \"Loch Fyne\", \"Loch Insh\", \"Loch Killisport\", \"Loch Lomond\" and \"Loch Ruthven\". The single gun was replaced by the ubiquitous twin mounting HA/LA Mark XIX and the A/A weaponry was standardised as a single twin mounting Mark V and four single mounting Mark VII for the 40 mm Bofors gun, with a Simple Tachymetric Director shipped for the Mark V. Radar Type 277 was fitted with the new ANU antenna array. \"Loch Killisport\" sported a gunshield manufactured from GRP to test this material for suitability of constructing the housing of the new 4.5-inch gun Mark 8. \"Loch Fada\" paid off in 1967 and was used to test an early vertical launch variant of the new Sea Wolf missile.\n\n1942 War Programme (4 ships):\n1943 War Programme (26 completed including 2 modified as Coastal Forces Depot Ships):\n\n\nAll three were returned to the Royal Navy in 1945.\n\n\n\nEx-Royal Navy vessels, transferred from 1948.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2330982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330982", "title": "Pickman's Model", "text": "Pickman's Model\n\n\"Pickman's Model\" is a short story by H. P. Lovecraft, written in September 1926 and first published in the October 1927 issue of \"Weird Tales\". It was adapted for television in a 1971 episode of the \"Night Gallery\" anthology series, starring Bradford Dillman.\n\nThe story revolves around a Bostonian painter named Richard Upton Pickman who creates horrifying images. His works are brilliantly executed, but so graphic that they result in the revocation of his membership in the Boston Art Club and he is shunned by his fellow artists.\n\nThe narrator is a friend of Pickman, who, after the artist's mysterious disappearance, relates to another acquaintance how he was taken on a tour of Pickman's personal gallery, hidden away in a run-down backwater slum of the city. As the two delved deeper into Pickman's mind and art, the rooms seemed to grow ever more evil and the paintings ever more horrific, ending with a final enormous painting of an unearthly, red-eyed and vaguely canine humanoid balefully chewing on a human victim.\n\nA noise sent Pickman running outside the room with a gun while the narrator reached out to unfold what looked like a small piece of rolled paper attached to the monstrous painting. The narrator heard some shots and Pickman walked back in with the smoking gun, telling a story of shooting some rats, and the two men departed.\n\nAfterwards the narrator realized that he had nervously grabbed and put the rolled paper in his pocket when the shots were fired. He unrolled the paper to reveal that it is a photograph not of the background of the painting, but of the subject. Pickman drew his inspirations not from a diseased imagination, but from monsters that were very much real.\n\n\n\n\nLike the Brooklyn neighborhood portrayed in Lovecraft's \"The Horror at Red Hook\", Boston's North End is depicted as a rundown section inhabited by immigrants and honeycombed by subterranean passageways. Pickman declares:\n\nPrince Street, like Henchman Street, Charter Street, and Greenough Lane, are actual North End streets. Though the story is vague about the precise location of Pickman's studio, it was apparently inspired by an actual North End building. Lovecraft wrote that when he visited the neighborhood with Donald Wandrei, he found \"the actual alley & house of the tale utterly demolished, a whole crooked line of buildings having been torn down\".\n\nPickman's aesthetic principles of horror resemble those in Lovecraft's essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" (1925–1927), on which he was working at the time the short story was composed. When Thurber, the story's narrator, notes that \"only the real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fear—the exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness\", he is echoing Lovecraft the literary critic on Poe, who \"understood so perfectly the very mechanics and physiology of fear and strangeness\".\n\nThurber's description of Pickman as a \"thorough, painstaking, and almost scientific \"realist\"\" recalls Lovecraft's approach to horror in his post-Dunsanian phase.\n\nThe story compares Pickman's work to that of a number of actual artists, including John Henry Fuseli (1741–1825), Gustave Doré (1832–1883), Sidney Sime (1867–1941), Anthony Angarola (1893–1929), Francisco Goya (1746–1828), and Clark Ashton Smith (1893–1961).\n\nThe technique is unusual for Lovecraft. The first-person narrative takes the form of a monologue directed at the reader in effect as a fictive listener, whose presumed interjections are implied via the narrator's responses to them. Tangential comments reveal that the conversation takes place in the narrator's Boston drawing room at eve, where the two have just arrived via taxi. Pickman's narrative-within-the-narrative is also a monologue, directed in turn at the outer narrator as listener. Both narratives are colloquial, casual and emotionally expressive, which is atypical of Lovecraft's protagonists and style.\n\n\nFritz Leiber, in his essay \"A Literary Copernicus\", praised the story for the \"supreme chill\" of its final line. Peter Cannon calls the tale \"a well-nigh perfect example of Poe's unity of effect principle\", though he cites as its \"one weakness\" the \"contrived ending\". \"An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia\" dismisses the story as \"relatively conventional\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its objective is the creation of a Sikh independent state of Khalistan through armed struggle. According to the US State Department, and the Assistant Inspector General of the Punjab Police Intelligence Division, the KCF was responsible for many assassinations in India, including the 1995 assassination of Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh. India has declared and banned KCF as a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe creation of a Sikh independent state of Khalistan through armed struggle is their primary goal. KCF primarily targeted Indian security forces including CRPF, BSF and other police forces. It targeted Hindus who were against of the Khalistan movement. The primary source of funding of KCF is looting, bank robbery and extortion. It is also involved in large scale smuggling of weapons from Pakistan to India across the International border. \n\nThe Khalistan Commando Force was founded by Manbir Singh Chaheru in August 1986.\n\nThe group later broke into multiple factions. The rump of the organisation was retained by KCF (Zaffarwal). The small splinters joined different militant alliances.\n\nOn 8 August 1986, Punjab Police arrested Manbir Singh Chaheru (\"Hari Singh\"), and he was eventually killed or disappeared while in police custody. After Chaheru was arrested, former police officer Sukhdev Singh, also known as Sukha Sipahi, took command of the KCF. Sukhdev Singh changed his name to Labh Singh and assumed the title of \"General\".\n\nAfter his death the KCF was headed by Kanwarjit Singh Sultanwind\nOn 18 October 1989, Kanwarjit Singh Sultanwind, and another two KCF members were arrested by police near Jalandhar. While one member managed to escape, Kanwarjit Singh Sultanwind, then 23 years old, swallowed a cyanide capsule to avoid giving information about the group.\n\nOperation Black Thunder against the sikh militants in Golden Temple greatly degraded the capability of KCF to conduct operations. Police killed Labh Singh on 12 July 1988.\nHis loss damaged the organisation. After his death, the Khalistan Commando Force split into factions including those led by Wassan Singh Zaffarwal, Paramjit Singh Panjwar and Gurjant Singh Rajasthani.\n\nAnother result of Labh Singh's death was the failure of the Khalistan Commando Force - Babbar Khalsa alliance, as the relationship established by Labh Singh and Sukhdev Singh Babbar was lost.\n\nPolice and other Indian security forces caught or killed Lieutenant Generals and Area Commanders, and eventually crushed many of the factions.\n\nThe organisation battled Indian military forces, especially in revenge for Operation Blue Star, the government's 1984 military operation in the Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar.\n\nIt assassinated General Arun Vaidya, who led the Indian forces in Operation Blue Star.\n\nIt also attacked sellers of alcohol, cigarettes, and other items prohibited by conservative Sikhism.\n\nSikh militants from Khalistan Commando Force attacked two buses. They singled out and killed 34 Hindu bus passengers in 1987 Haryana killings.\n\nAfter the major defeats of the KCF in the late 1980s, the group continued its struggle into the 1990s.\n\nA June 1991 attack on a passenger train in northwestern Punjab killed about fifty, mostly Hindu, passengers.\n\nA September 1993 bombing in New Delhi targeting Indian Youth Congress president Maninderjeet Singh Bitta that killed eight people.\n\nOn 9 October 1992, Harjinder Singh Jinda and Sukhdev Singh Sukha, alleged assassins of General Arun Vaidya, were hanged until death in Pune jail.\n\nPolice also killed thousands of suspects in staged shootouts and burned thousands of dead bodies to cover up the murders.\n\nThe KCF was listed in 1995 one of the 4 \"major militant groups\" in the Khalistan movement.\n\nIn June 2006 a member of the Panjwar faction of the KCF, Kulbir Singh Barapind was extradited from the US to India. He was deported to India for belonging to a terrorist organisation and for entering the United States with a false passport. He was wanted in India for thirty-two cases, but was arrested for three murders in the early 1990s. After his arrest, he stated that he would renew the Khalistan movement through peaceful means.\n\nThe investigation began in 2003, when Khalid Awan, jailed at the time for credit card fraud, bragged of his relationship with Paramjeet Singh Panjwar, leader of the KCF. Awan was given a 14-year prison sentence in 2007 on terrorism charges.\n\nIn 2008, Punjab Police announced they had foiled a KCF effort to kill Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of Dera Sacha Sauda.\n\nParamjeet Singh Panjwar remained the head of the remaining faction of the KCF as of 2008, and was listed at that time as one of the top 10 most wanted criminals in India. As per the released statement of Khalid Awan - a Canadian citizen - who served 14-year sentence in the U.S. prisons for transferring money to KCF, Panjwar is a VIP in Pakistan and has the support of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. On the other hand, the U.S prosecutors have claimed that Awan admitted of transferring money to Panjwar despite knowing the fact that the money will be used to carry out attacks against India. \n\nThe University of Maryland beta version of the \"Global Terrorism Database\" has recorded 2 attacks on military targets, 9 attacks on police or other government targets, and 9 attacks against civilian, religious, transportation or educational entities, in both India and Pakistan, as of June 2009.\n\nThe KCF remains banned in India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and designated as terrorist organisation by the Government of India.\n\nA 2011 NPR report claimed a person associated with this group was imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit in the US.\n\n"}

{"id": "2330988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330988", "title": "Flushed Away", "text": "Flushed Away\n\nFlushed Away is a 2006 computer-animated adventure comedy film directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell, produced by Cecil Kramer, David Sproxton, and Peter Lord, and written by Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais, Chris Lloyd, Joe Keenan and William Davies. It is the third and final film to be co-produced by Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation following \"Chicken Run\" (2000) and \"\" (2005), and was Aardman's first completely computer-animated featua as opposed to their usual stop motion standard. The film stars the voice talents of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Andy Serkis, Bill Nighy, Ian McKellen, Shane Richie and Jean Reno. In \"Flushed Away\", a pet rat named Roddy St. James is flushed down the toilet by a sewer rat, and befriends a scavenger named Rita in order to return home while evading a toad and his rat henchmen.\n\nThe film was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on 3 November 2006, and in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2006. Despite receiving positive reviews from critics, who praised its animation, writing, humour and voice performances, \"Flushed Away\" underperformed at the box office, prompting DreamWorks to end their partnership with Aardman. The film received nominations for the BAFTA Award and Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Feature. It also got 8 nominations at the 34th Annie Awards, winning a leading 5, including Writing in a Feature Production.\n\nRoddy St. James is an upper class pet rat who makes his home in a posh Kensington flat. While his owners are away on holiday, a common sewer rat named Sid comes spewing out of the sink and decides to stay, especially as England is playing against Germany in the World Cup Final. Roddy schemes to get rid of Sid by luring him into the toilet, but Sid is not fooled, instead throwing Roddy in and flushing him away into the sewer.\n\nRoddy discovers a city resembling London, Ratropolis, made out of various bits of junk, and meets Rita Malone, an enterprising scavenger rat who works the drains in her faithful boat, the \"Jammy Dodger\". Rita is irritated by Roddy initially, but ends up taking him along. Her archenemy The Toad sends his rat henchmen, Spike and Whitey, after her for stealing back her father's prized ruby. The Toad loathes all rodents, and plans to have Roddy and Rita frozen with liquid nitrogen inside an icemaker. The pair escape, and Rita takes a unique electrical cable that is required to control Ratropolis' floodgates.\n\nRoddy discovers that the ruby is a fake and breaks it in front of Rita. Enraged, Rita tries to attack Roddy, but eventually calms down and explains that she is only angry because her father (quite literally) broke every bone in his body trying to obtain it just for her to find that it was just a worthless fake. Roddy offers Rita a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington, to which she agrees, and the pair first stop to visit her family before setting off. During Roddy's stay, he overhears a conversation that causes him to think that Rita is selling him to The Toad, so he reneges on the deal and steals the \"Jammy Dodger\". When Rita catches up to him, she is able to clear up the misunderstanding. The pair evade a pursuit from Spike, Whitey, and their accomplices, and incensed at his minions' repeated failures, The Toad sends for his French cousin, known as Le Frog. It is revealed that The Toad was Prince Charles' favorite childhood pet until he was abruptly replaced by a pet rat and subsequently flushed down a toilet, resulting in his hatred of rodents. Le Frog and his subordinates intercept Roddy and Rita and retrieve the cable, sinking the \"Jammy Dodger\" in the process, but the duo use a plastic bag to lift themselves out of the sewer and back to Roddy's home.\n\nRoddy pays Rita the promised ruby and an emerald, then shows her around his house. She at first believes he has family in the home, but notices his cage and realizes he is a pet. Rita tries to persuade Roddy to come with her, but he is too proud to admit that he is lonely. She departs, but is soon captured by The Toad. Talking to Sid about half-time, Roddy pieces together The Toad's plan: to open the gates during halftime of the World Cup, when all the humans will most likely be using their toilets. As a result, a great sewage flood will form and drown Ratropolis in sewage, allowing The Toad to use the city as a home for his tadpole offspring. Roddy gives Sid his cushy position and has Sid flush him back to the sewers. He frees Rita, and together they defeat The Toad and his henchmen and freeze the wave of sewage with his liquid nitrogen.\n\nRita and Roddy build the \"Jammy Dodger Mark II\" and set off in her while Le Frog and his men hitchhike back to France.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Roddy's former owner Tabitha returns home with a new pet cat, which scares Sid.\n\n\nThe idea for a film about rats which fall in love in a sewer was proposed by animator Sam Fell during the production of Aardman Animation's \"Chicken Run\" (2000). At the time, Aardman encouraged everyone at the company to come up with ideas for features for the DreamWorks partnership. Fell, development executive Mike Cooper, and producer Peter Lord then developed the concept into a story before pitching it to DreamWorks. Lord described the pitch as \"\"The African Queen\" with the gender roles reversed.\" Comic writing duo, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were contracted to write the script for the film, which went under the working title of \"Ratropolis\".\n\nTraditionally, Aardman have used stop-motion for their animated features, but it is complex to render water with this technique, and using real water can damage plasticine models. It would have been expensive to composite CGI into shots that include water, of which there are many in the movie, so they chose to make \"Flushed Away\" their first all-CGI production. This is the third and final of three Aardman-produced films released by DreamWorks. Aardman's experience with DreamWorks during the making of the film led to a split between the two studios.\n\nOn Halloween (31 October) of 2006, the \"Flushed Away: Music from the Motion Picture\" soundtrack was released by Astralwerks.\n\nCoinciding with the film's release, a video game adaptation was released on the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and on the Nintendo DS. Although having heavily negative reviews from critics, the game received an Annie Award for best animated video game.\n\n\"Flushed Away\" was released on DVD 20 February 2007. It included behind the scenes, deleted info, Jammy Dodger videos and all new slug songs. It was released in the UK on 2 April 2007, where it was also packaged with a plasticine 'Slug Farm' kit. The film was released on Blu-ray by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on 4 June 2019.\n\n\"Flushed Away\" has a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.71/10 based on 137 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads \"Clever and appealing for both children and adults, \"Flushed Away\" marks a successful entry into digital animated features for Aardman Animations.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 74, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"As directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell, first-time feature helmers with long-term Aardman affiliations, the film boasts undeniably smart and eye-catching qualities that are significantly diluted by the relentlessly frantic and overbearing behavior of most characters; someone is always loudly imposing himself upon another, to diminishing returns of enjoyment.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B+, saying \"\"Flushed Away\" lacks the action-contraption dottiness of a Wallace and Gromit adventure, but it hits its own sweet spot of demented delight.\" James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"It's better than 90% of the animated fare of the last few years. It's refreshing not to have to qualify the movie's appeal by appending the words, 'for the kids'.\" Jan Stuart of \"Newsday\" gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"Despite the efforts of five writers and Aardman's trademark puppets, with their malleable eyebrows and cheeks bulging like those of a mumps sufferer, none of these characters are particularly endearing.\" Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"\"Flushed Away\", Aardman's first computer-generated cartoon, does away with the clay but leaves the craft and emotion intact, resulting in a film that earns its place among the Aardman classics.\" Peter Hartlaub of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The short attention spans of directors David Bowers and Sam Fell are mostly forgivable because the movie is filled with so many entertaining characters.\"\n\nRichard Corliss of \"Time\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"Deficient in the comedy of reticence discouragement that is Aardman's (or maybe just Nick Park's) unique strength. I don't want to say the Englishmen were corrupted, but I think they allowed their strongest, quirkiest instincts to be tethered.\" Ted Fry of \"The Seattle Times\" gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Fans of Wallace and Gromit may be puzzled by a visual disconnect in \"Flushed Away\". They will certainly, however, be delighted by the unrelenting whimsy and fast-paced gags of a story that never slows down to think about where it's going next.\" Ty Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying \"Kids will probably be in stinky-sewage heaven with the new computer-animated critter comedy \"Flushed Away\", but even they may realize they're up the proverbial creek in a boat with a faulty motor.\" Jack Mathews of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"Though \"Flushed Away\" duplicates the stop-motion, clay animation look of Aardman's earlier \"Chicken Run\" and Wallace & Gromit, it was made using computer software and its liberated action sequences are truly dazzling.\" Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"How this thing got made in Hollywood is a mystery, but I laughed at most of it, especially the mean stereotypes about the French and the even meaner stereotype about England's soccer team.\"\n\n\"Flushed Away\" collected $64,488,856 in the United States, which was below the average of other CGI films from DreamWorks Animation, and $111,814,663 from international markets for a worldwide total of $176,319,242. The film opened to number three in its first weekend, with $18,814,323, behind \"Borat\" and \"\". Produced on a budget of $149 million, poor box office reception resulted in a $109-million write-down for DreamWorks Animation, and in a termination of the partnership with Aardman Animations.\n\n"}

It is a paired artery, with one running along each side of the sternum, to continue after its bifurcation as the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries.\n\nThe internal thoracic artery arises from the subclavian artery near its origin.\n\nIt travels downward on the inside of the ribcage, approximately a centimeter from the sides of the sternum, and thus medial to the nipple. It is accompanied by the internal thoracic vein.\n\nIt runs deep to the external oblique, but superficial to the vagus nerve\n\n\nAfter passing the sixth intercostal space, the internal thoracic artery splits into the following two terminal branches:\n\nThe internal thoracic artery is the cardiac surgeon's blood vessel of choice for coronary artery bypass grafting. The left ITA has a superior long-term patency to saphenous vein grafts and other arterial grafts (e.g. radial artery, gastroepiploic artery) when grafted to the left anterior descending coronary artery, generally the most important vessel, clinically, to revascularize.\n\nPlastic surgeons may use either the left or right internal thoracic arteries for autologous free flap reconstruction of the breast after mastectomy.

Boards had a special duty to promote good relationships between the school, its parents and the community and also form a channel for the flow of information between these groups. School Boards were introduced in 1988 as part of the Government's policy of encouraging parental involvement in schools. They comprised parent, teacher and 'co-opted' members, with parents in the majority. 'Co-opted' members may have been drawn from local business or the community.\n\nThey were established by the \"School Boards Act 1988\", which mandated that they be set up in education authority schools in Scotland. Boards consisted of elected parent and staff members and other members co-opted by the elected members.\n\nChanges were made to the running of School Boards in the \"Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. Act 2000\", which included the possibility that parent members could be co-opted if not enough were elected for the board to continue.\n\nThey were abolished by the \"Scottish School Act 2006\" introduced to the Scottish Parliament on 28 September 2005, which would see them replaced by a two-tier system of Parent Forums and Parent Councils.\n\nSchool boards were intended to provide input of parents into the provision of education at the local school, and to allow for the delegation of powers from regional authorities to schools.\n\nThe powers of boards included the ability to request information on schools in their area and the right to receive and comment on financial statements. A headteacher would need the school boards approval before spending the schools budget assigned for books and materials. While a board could nominate members to sit on a committee for appointing new staff, they had no role in firing staff, or the discipline of pupils.\n\nThe 1988 Act provided for elections for school boards to be held in all schools except for the very few schools whose roll is so small that there are insufficient parents to form a school board. Schools in which elections are required to be held are referred to as ‘eligible schools’.\n\nSchool boards were composed of parent members, staff members - meaning teaching staff, and co-opted members who were chosen by the board. Co-opted members would not be eligible as staff or parent members. The local Councillor and the Director of Education could also attend and speak at meetings. Board members hold office for four years, with half the parent places coming up for election every two years. The initial round of elections to school boards was held in 1989-1990.\n\nSchool boards, the size and composition of which is laid down in the \"School Board Regulations 1989\", were only established when sufficient parent members are elected through contested or uncontested regular elections, or by-elections. In cases where insufficient parents were elected to form a school board, a board could be established through the co-option of some parent members. Where a School Board did not exist, this is either because the school is a non-qualifying school, or because no board was formed as a result of a regular election, a by-election or under other provisions.\n\n\n"}

In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an entheogen, particularly in the Indian subcontinent where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.\n\nIn the modern era Rastafari use cannabis as a sacred herb. Meanwhile, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of medicinal cannabis.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, use of alcohol and other drugs for intoxication, as opposed to medical prescription, is prohibited, see Bahá'í laws. But Bahá'í practice is such laws should be applied with \"tact and wisdom\". The use of tobacco is an individual decision, it is yet strongly frowned on but not explicitly forbidden. Bahá'í authorities have spoken against intoxicant drugs since the earliest stages of the religion, with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writing:\n\nIn Buddhism, the Fifth Precept is frequently interpreted to mean \"refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to heedlessness\", although in some direct translations, the Fifth Precept refers specifically to alcohol. Cannabis and some other psychoactive plants are specifically prescribed in the Mahākāla Tantra for medicinal purposes.\n\nPrior to assuming his position as leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis had spoken against recreational cannabis. He stated in 2013 in Buenos Aires: \"A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use.\" The catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense.\"\n\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church has resisted legalization of cannabis in Georgia.\n\nThe Arkansas Baptist State Convention voted to discourage medical marijuana in 2016. In 2016, the executive director of the Florida Baptist Convention, Tommy Green, also said that congregations should be encouraged to vote against the Florida Amendment 2 (2016) which expanded legalization of medical marijuana in Florida. The National Evangelical Association of Belize opposed the 2017 decriminalization of cannabis in Belize.\n\nThe Assemblies of God USA, as well as other Pentecostal and holiness churches, have historically advocated abstinence from all alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. Supporters of this view generally cite biblical passages enjoining respect for one's body as well as forbidding intoxication.\n\nOther Protestant churches have endorsed the legality of medical marijuana, including the Presbyterian Church (USA), United Methodist Church, United Church of Christ, and the Episcopal Church.\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is general prohibition against intoxicating substances. In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members. In 2016, the church's First Presidency urged members to oppose legalization of recreational cannabis use. The LDS Church says it has \"raised no objection to SB 89\" (non-psychoactive medical marijuana in Utah).\n\nDuring the Hindu festival of Holi, people consume \"bhang\" which contains cannabis flowers. According to one description, when the \"amrita\" (elixir of life) was produced from the churning of the ocean by the devas and the asuras as described in the Samudra manthan, Shiva created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir (whence, for cannabis, the epithet \"angaja\" or \"body-born\"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by sages due to association with elixir and Shiva. \nIn Hinduism, wise drinking of \"bhang\" (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with Shiva and avoid the miseries of hell in the future life. It is also believed to have medicinal benefits. In contrast, foolish drinking of \"bhang\" without rites is considered a sin.\nIn Vaishnava sect of Hinduism, which even comprises modern organisations like ISKCON, consumption of marijuana and any form of intoxicant is strictly prohibited.\n\nThe Quran does not directly forbid cannabis. There is a controversy among Muslim scholars about cannabis as some deemed it to be similar to \"khamr\" (alcoholic drink) and therefore believed it to be \"haraam\" (forbidden). Other scholars, especially in Shia Islam consider cannabis to be \"halal\" (permissible).\n\nThose scholars who consider cannabis forbidden refer to a hadith by the prophet Mohammed regarding alcoholic drinks, which states: \"If much intoxicates, then even a little is haraam.\" However, early Muslim jurists differentiated cannabis from alcohol, and despite restrictions on alcohol, cannabis use was prevalent in the Islamic world until the 18th century. Today, cannabis is still consumed in many parts of the Islamic world, even sometimes in a religious context particularly within the Sufi mystic movement. In 1378 Soudoun Sheikouni, the Emir of the Joneima in Arabia, prohibited cannabis, considered one of the world's first-attested cannabis bans.\n\nThe Sufi tradition attributes the discovery of cannabis to Jafar Sharazi (Sheikh Haydar), a Sufi leader in the 12th century. Other Sufis attribute its origin to the apocryphal Khidr (\"Green Man\").\n\nSome modern Islamic leaders state that medical cannabis, but not recreational, is permissible in Islam. Imam Mohammad Elahi in Dearborn Heights, Michigan (United States), declared: \"Obviously, smoking marijuana for fun is wrong... It should be permissible only if that is the only option in a medical condition prescribed by medical experts.\"\n\nThough the argument has not been accepted by mainstream scholars, some writers have theorized that cannabis may have been used ritually in early Judaism, though these claims \"have been widely dismissed as erroneous\". Sula Benet (1967) claimed that the plant \"kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם\" mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the holy anointing oil of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis, although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by Michael Zohary (1985), Hans Arne Jensen (2004) and James A. Duke (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either \"Acorus calamus\" or \"Cymbopogon citratus\". In 2020 a study at Tel Arad, a 2700-year-old shrine then at the southern frontier of the Kingdom of Judah, found that burnt offerings on one altar contained multiple cannabinoid compounds, suggesting the ritual use of cannabis within ancient Judaism.\n\nIn the modern era, Orthodox rabbi Moshe Feinstein stated in 1973 that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects. However Orthodox rabbis Efraim Zalmanovich (2013) and Chaim Kanievsky (2016) stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher.\n\nIt is not known when Rastafari first claimed cannabis to be sacred, but it is clear that by the late 1940s Rastafari was associated with cannabis smoking at the Pinnacle community of Leonard Howell. Rastafari see cannabis as a sacramental and deeply beneficial plant that is the Tree of Life mentioned in the Bible and quote , \"... the herb is the healing of the nations.\" The use of cannabis, and particularly of long-stemmed water-pipes called chalices, is an integral part of what Rastafari call \"reasoning sessions\" where members join together to discuss life according to the Rasta perspective. They see the use of cannabis as bringing them closer to God (Jah), allowing the user to penetrate the truth of things more clearly.\n\nWhile it is not necessary to use cannabis to be a Rastafari, many use it regularly as a part of their faith, and pipes of cannabis are dedicated to His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I before being smoked. According to the Watchman Fellowship \"The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and God. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness\" and is believed to burn the corruption out of the human heart. Rubbing the ashes into the skin from smoked cannabis is also considered a healthy practice.\n\nPart of the Rastafari movement, elders of the 20th-century religious movement known as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, consider cannabis to be the \"eucharist\", claiming it as an oral tradition from Ethiopia dating back to the time of Christ.\n\nScientology opposes the use of cannabis, and made \"Truth About Marijuana\" the focus of their 2016 World Health Day presentation.\n\nIn Sikhism, the First Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak, stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction to keeping the mind clean of the name of God. According to the \"Sikh Rehat Maryada\", \"A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, in short any intoxicant. His only routine intake should be food and water\".\n\nHowever, there exists a tradition of Sikhs using edible cannabis, often in the form of the beverage bhang, particularly among the Sikh community known as Nihang.\n\nBeginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in censers. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia \"Wushang Biyao\" 無上秘要 (\"Supreme Secret Essentials\") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with \"hallucinogenic smokes\". The \"Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji\" 元始上真眾仙記 (\"Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals\"), which is attributed to Ge Hong (283-343), says:\n\nLady Wei Huacun 魏華存 (252-334) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376) founded the Taoist Shangqing School. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to Yang Xi 楊羲 (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from immortals, and Needham proposed Yang was \"aided almost certainly by cannabis\". The \"Mingyi bielu\" 名醫別錄 (\"Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians\"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist Tao Hongjing (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, \"Hemp-seeds (麻勃) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (\"shujia\" 術家) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.\" A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the \"Wuzangjing\" 五臟經 (\"Five Viscera Classic\") says, \"If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant.\"\n\nJoseph Needham connected myths about Magu, \"the Hemp Damsel\", with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis, pointing out that Magu was goddess of Shandong's sacred Mount Tai, where cannabis \"was supposed to be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month, a day of seance banquets in the Taoist communities.\"\n\nOther religions have been founded in the past century that treat cannabis as a sacrament. They include the Santo Daime church, the THC Ministry, Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly, the Church of Cognitive Therapy (COCT Ministry), Temple 420, Green Faith Ministries, the Church of Cognizance, the Church of the Universe, the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu, the First Cannabis Church of Florida World Wide, the Free Life Ministry Church of Canthe, the Church of Higher Consciousness, and the federally tax-exempt inFormer Ministry Collective of Palms Springs, CA. The Temple of the True Inner Light believes that cannabis is one of the parts of God's body, along with the classical psychedelics: mescaline, psilocybin, LSD, and DMT. The First Church of Cannabis Inc. officially gained legal recognition in Indiana in 2015 following the passage of that state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Nonprofit religious organization Elevation Ministries opened its Denver headquarters, known as the International Church of Cannabis, on April 20, 2017.\n\nSome modern spiritual figures like Ram Dass openly acknowledge that the use of cannabis has allowed them to gain a more spiritual perspective and use the herb frequently for both its medicinal and mind-altering properties.\n\nIn Mexico, followers of the growing cult of Santa Muerte regularly use marijuana smoke in purification ceremonies, with marijuana often taking the place of incense used in mainstream Catholic rituals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2331012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331012", "title": "Robert Herman", "text": "Robert Herman\n\nRobert Herman (August 29, 1914 – February 13, 1997) was a United States scientist, best known for his work with Ralph Alpher in 1948-50, on estimating the temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation from the Big Bang explosion.\n\nBorn in the Bronx, New York City, Herman graduated cum laude with special honors in physics from the City College of New York in 1935, and in 1940 was awarded master's and doctoral degrees in physics from Princeton University in the area of molecular spectroscopy. As a graduate student, Herman already exhibited eclectic tendencies in diverse fields by also working in solid state physics, as well as straddling theory and experiment. He spent the academic year 1940-41 working on the Bush differential analyzer at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, and another year teaching physics at the City College of New York.\n\nIn 1942, he left teaching to work at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C., and the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, all research centers for the war effort. He worked on such problems as the proximity fuse for naval antiaircraft gunfire, which was used effectively during the war. It was then that Herman became intrigued with defining and solving complex problems. He shifted his attention from theory and laboratory work and became deeply involved with field testing of the proximity device and the operational problems associated with its use in the fleet. In 1945, he received the Naval Ordnance Development Award.\n\nAfter World War II, Herman spent another decade at the Applied Physics Lab pursuing research in spectroscopy and condensed-matter physics. It was during this period that he and Ralph Alpher did their now famous work on cosmology. In 1948, as a consequence of their studies of nucleosynthesis in the early expanding Big Bang universe model, they made the first theoretical prediction of the existence of a residual, homogeneous, isotopic, blackbody radiation (cosmic microwave background radiation) that pervades the universe as a vestige of the initial Big Bang explosion.\n\nThis work received some notice at the time, but soon fell into obscurity. In 1964, the radiation was accidentally detected by two scientists, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, while trying to correct a malfunction in a radio dish. After eliminating every conceivable source of interference, they concluded that the radiation source was not of earthly origin. After learning about this work, a group of physicists from Princeton University interpreted it as background radiation of cosmic origin, but without reference to the two 1948 papers, one by Alpher, Bethe and Gamow (therefore sometimes called the α-β-γ paper) and the other by Alpher and Herman. The Big Bang model for the origin of the universe became widely accepted, and in 1978 a Nobel Prize was awarded to Bell scientists Penzias and Wilson for their detection of the cosmic background radiation. When recalling the culmination of this series of events, Herman remarked graciously, \"You don't give recognition to the person; you give it to the work.\"\n\nNevertheless, the team of Herman and Alpher were eventually recognized for their pioneering contribution. In 1993, the National Academy of Sciences announced that they would share the Henry Draper Medal, the oldest award of the Academy, for their contributions to astronomical physics. They were recognized \"for their insight and skill in developing a physical model of the evolution of the universe and in predicting the existence of a microwave background radiation years before this radiation was serendipitously discovered; through this work they were participants in one of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century.\" They also received the Magellanic Premium of the American Philosophical Society, the John Price Wetherill Medal of the Franklin Institute, and the Georges Vanderlinden Prix of the Belgian Royal Academy.\n\nIn 1956, Herman joined the General Motors Research Laboratory, as head of the basic science group, later renamed the theoretical physics department. He introduced science into the affairs of his employer by inventing a new science, traffic science. Drawing upon his background in physics, he first directed his attention to the description of the microscopic behavior of traffic: the detailed manner in which individual drivers avoid coinciding with each other in space and time, at least most of the time.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Herman joined with Elliott Waters Montroll and others in developing the car-following theory of traffic flow, a theory that has stood the test of time and is still the state of the art today. Shortly thereafter, Herman and Ilya Prigogine, a future Nobel Laureate, developed a theory of multilane traffic flow. For more than thirty-five years, Herman moved into diverse fields of traffic science, always leaving his characteristic mark of excellence. In recent years, he worked with his students and colleagues to develop a \"two-fluid model of town traffic,\" a description of vehicular traffic on urban road networks, an extension of the theory that he formulated with Prigogine some years before. This theory, along with his earlier work, has been significant in the development of the now-emerging Intelligent Transportation Systems concept.\n\nIn 1979, Herman joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin, with a joint appointment as professor of physics, in the Center for Studies in Statistical Mechanics, and the L.P. Gilvin Professor in Civil Engineering. He later became the L.P. Gilvin Centennial Professor Emeritus in Civil Engineering. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.\n\nIn his spare time, Herman was known to ponder the physics of musical instruments, such as the mechanics of a cello bow and the acoustics of the English flute. He played and collected antique cellos.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, he began creating small sculptures from exotic woods and metals. For the next decade, he pursued this creative and meaningful quest to find the least-mediated, least-quantifiable relation between matter and the imagination. An exhibition of several of his carvings was presented at the National Academy of Engineering in Washington, D.C., in 1994, at the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin in 1995, and at the Leu Art Gallery of Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1996.\n\nDuring the last several years of his life, Herman grew increasingly concerned about the state of education in the United States, the changing yet increasingly critical role of the university in society, the increasing encroachment of political considerations on the education and research enterprise, the constant attacks on academic freedom, and the continuing erosion of the base upon which the nation's great achievements in science and technology have been attained. In his last two years, he busily compiled and analyzed data on all sorts of performance indicators of quality and productivity of university departments. This was part of a broader effort to model universities as complex systems.\n\nHerman died in Austin, Texas, on February 13, 1997.\n\n"}

Ōtomo warriors fought alongside those of Ashikaga Takauji and enabled him to win a number of key battles, including the battle of Sanoyama; this helped to ensure them powerful government positions in the new shogunate.\n\nA powerful clan throughout the Sengoku period (1467–1573), the Ōtomo are especially notable as one of the first clans to make contact with Europeans, and to establish a trade relationship with them. In or around 1542, three Portuguese ships were carried by a typhoon to the island of Tanegashima, just off the coast of Kyūshū. Within ten years, trade with the Portuguese was fairly regular and common in Kyūshū. The Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier arrived in Japan in 1549, and soon afterwards met with Ōtomo Sōrin, \"shugo\" of Bungo and Buzen provinces, who would later be described by Xavier as a \"king\" and convert to Roman Catholicism in 1578. Ōtomo was eager to secure for his clan further trade and contact with the Portuguese, seeing the technological and, more importantly perhaps, economic benefits that could be derived. In 1552, emissaries from the Ōtomo clan traveled to Goa with Xavier, to meet with the Portuguese Governor of India. Xavier and other Jesuit missionaries would return to Kyūshū, traveling and proselytizing; the Ōtomo were always well-disposed towards them, and they saw some success in Bungo as a result, converting many Japanese to Christianity.\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, the Ōtomo fought both the Shimazu and Mōri clans, of whom the latter were expert sailors. Though they did not play a major role in the campaigns of Tokugawa Ieyasu which ended the Sengoku period, they did retain their domains into the Edo period.\n\n\n\nOtomo is a playable nation in the grand strategy games \"Europa Universalis IV\", \"Sengoku\" as well as in \"Shogun 2\".\n\n\n"}

She was to have been named HMS \"Royal Oak\", but the name was changed to \"Renown\" on 15 February 1796. She was launched at Deptford Wharf on 2 May 1798 and served in 1800-1801 as the flagship of Sir John Borlase Warren, initially in the English Channel.\n\nOn 1 July 1800, \"Renown\", and , with the hired armed cutter in company, were in Bourneuf Bay when they sent in their boats to attack a French convoy at Île de Noirmoutier. The British destroyed the French ship \"Therese\" (of 20 guns), a lugger (12 guns), two schooners (6 guns each) and a cutter (6 guns), of unknown names. The cutting out party also burned some 15 merchant vessels loaded with corn and supplies for the French fleet at Brest. However, in this enterprise, 92 officers and men out of the entire party of 192 men, fell prisoners to the French when their boats became stranded. \"Lord Nelson\" had contributed no men to the attacking force and so had no casualties.\n\nNext, \"Renown\" participated in an abortive invasion of Ferrol. On 29 August, in Vigo Bay, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood assembled a cutting-out party from the vessels under his command consisting of two boats each from , , , and , four boats from , as well as the boats from \"Renown\", and \"Impetueux\". The party went in and after a 15-minute fight captured the French privateer \"Guêpe\", of Bordeaux and towed her out. She was of 300 tons burthen and had a flush deck. Pierced for 20 guns, she carried eighteen 9-pounders, and she and her crew of 161 men were under the command of Citizen Dupan. In the attack she lost 25 men killed, including Dupan, and 40 wounded. British casualties amounted to four killed, 23 wounded and one missing. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"29 Aug. Boat Service 1800\" to all surviving claimants from the action.\n\nShe then served at the abortive attack on Cadiz.\n\nArmed , she transferred to the Mediterranean in 1801, still as Warren's flagship. During this time Charles John Napier, the future admiral, was a midshipman in her. Because \"Renown\" served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 2 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \"Egypt\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants.\n\nIn 1803 she was at Malta and in 1805 was under repair at Plymouth. After a further spell in the Channel Fleet (1807-8), she transferred again to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn 1809, she took part in the Battle of Maguelone. \n\n\"Renown\" was laid up at Plymouth in 1811 and hulked in 1814. She was broken up in May 1835.\n\nIn the Horatio Hornblower novels of C. S. Forester, a ship of the line named the \"Renown\" (unrelated to the historical \"Renown\" of this period), is featured in the novel \"Lieutenant Hornblower\". In the story, the ship's mad captain is injured after falling through a hatch, and the junior officers must take over on adventures in the West Indies. The mysterious circumstances of the Captain's fall become of great importance to the court martial panel later on in the story. In Hornblower (TV series) this story was related in the fifth and sixth episodes, \"Mutiny\" and \"Retribution\".\n\n"}

The Grotto was embellished by Tiberius into a magnificent triclinium, mentioned by ancient writers, and with the famous exquisite sculptures which were discovered \"in situ\".\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, in the 6th century, the ruins of the imperial residence served as refuge for local people. Later the population began to move to the nearby promontory of St. Magnus, in order to escape the unhealthy marshes and the Saracen attacks. The danger posed by the Saracens is made clear by the presence of many watchtowers all along the coast to Gaeta. In 1534 the small centre was destroyed by the Ottoman fleet under Barbarossa.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries Sperlonga recovered and acquired some noble residences, and agriculture flourished. However, the touristic expansion occurred only after the opening of the Terracina-Gaeta coastal road (also known as the \"\") in 1957, the building of which led to the discovery of the sculptures in the grotto.\n\nSperlonga's main cultural attraction is the museum erected in the grounds of the former Villa of Tiberius showing the groups of sculpture found in the grotto celebrating the deeds of Odysseus. According to Tacitus and Suetonius, the roof of the grotto collapsed while Tiberius was dining, and Sejanus rushed to save Tiberius, for which Tiberius in gratitude promoted him, launching his rise to power. Tiberius moved to Capri after 26 AD.\n\nThe villa included a grotto where some sculptures, now housed in the museum, have been found: these portrayed the assault of Scylla to Odysseus' ship, the blinding of Polyphemus, the theft of the Palladium and Odysseus lifting Achilles's corpse. The works have been attributed to Rhodian sculptors Agesander, Athenedoros and Polydoros, and are thought to be the same authors of the group of \"Laocoön and His Sons\" (as attributed by Pliny the Elder). Yet whether the very same artists are responsible is questionable. Some scholars believe them to be related, but not the same people; apart from Athenedoros (II) who was the last to be credited as an artist on the Laocoon group, but first to be credited with the Scylla series – suggesting that he was the youngest during the creation of the Laocoon group, but eldest artist who worked on the Scylla group. Furthermore, the differentiation in 'classicism' between the two sets of works implies that one preceded the other with separation, and thus that not all artists are the same people, but descendants.\n\nThe most ancient church is that of \"Santa Maria\" (early 12th century), currently used for cultural events and spectacles: it is home to some mediaeval mosaics discovered during the last restorations.\n\nSperlonga is mostly a tourist town thanks to its beaches, a long beach on its west side going all the way to Terracina, and a series of short beaches and rocky cliffs on its east side towards Gaeta.\n\nThe main connection is that by road from Terracina and Gaeta. The nearest railways station is that of Fondi-Sperlonga, on one of the two Rome-Naples main lines (the one going via Formia).\n\n\n\n"}

Conboy\n\nFrederick Joseph Conboy (January 1, 1883 – March 29, 1949) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Toronto, Ontario from 1941 to 1944. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada.\n\nBefore entering politics, Conboy was a dental surgeon, served as a professor at the Royal College of Dental Surgeons, secretary of the Ontario Dental Association and editor of the association's journal.\n\nHe was educated in Toronto public and high schools (Dovercourt, Dewson and Givens Public Schools and Humberside Collegiate) and graduated from the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario. It was in 1904 that Conboy opened his office at Bloor and Westmoreland Street, a short distance from the family farm where he grew up. Since 1917 he had been professor of dental praxis at the School of Dentistry.\n\nWith the Masonic Order, Orange Order and the Odd Fellows, he again was a leader, but throughout Conboy's life his first interest lay in Westmoreland United Church. A charter member and elder of Westmoreland United Church, he was for over 20 years superintendent of the Sunday school. It was believed he was one of the first members of the church.\n\n\"The church,\" he often said, \"never fails in the matter of relief for needy citizens and there is no better place where young people can fit themselves for future citizenship than in promoting its welfare work.\"\n\nOne thing his closest friends never quite understood was how Conboy could find time for such a variety of activities. He belonged to two golf clubs and, in the war years, he started a victory garden that was the envy of neighbours for blocks around him. Even while taking a holiday, he would find an occupation that would call for a fresh release of enthusiasm and energy.\n\nIn 1924, while summering at Wasaga Beach, he discovered a cannonball at the edge of the Nottawasaga River. Not content with this trophy he spent the next two seasons prowling around and discovered the hull of a sunken ship buried in a large island that had formed around the wreck. He had found the remains of HMS \"Nancy\", a British armed schooner sunk by the Americans on August 11, 1814, during the War of 1812. Conboy interested the Ontario government in the preservation of the historic relic and, thanks to his persistence, the hull was excavated, raised, placed on the island and made available for public inspection. In recognition of his enterprise, his friends presented him with a model of the ship carved from her original timber.\n\nIn recognition of his work in public dental health, he was made a fellow of the International College of Dentists in 1919, a body composed of leading members of the profession in all parts of the world. He was a doctor of dental science at the University of Toronto. He served on the faculty of the dental college and was a member of the executive of the health section of the Ontario Educational Association.\n\nIn 1925, Conboy was appointed director of dental services for the province of Ontario. He contributed much to the advancement of the profession and devoted one day a week to organizing dental services in Toronto schools.\n\nIn 1926 he became director of dental service for the province, a position he held for ten years. He also served for twenty years as secretary and treasurer of the Ontario Dental Association. In 1935 he was appointed a professor at the School of Optometry.\n\nHe entered civic government in 1935 when elected as alderman for Ward six, polling the largest vote of any alderman-elect. Also elected as aldermen at same time were future mayors Allan Lamport, Nathan Phillips and Robert Saunders.\n\nConboy immediately introduced resolutions which keynoted his public career: resolutions on unemployment, slum clearance, youth placement, city planning, relief works programs, street lighting, public health education. He was elected to the board of control one year later. As a member of city council, Conboy campaigned for the development of an island airport and harbour facilities.\n\nDuring his wartime years in office as Mayor, Conboy began a campaign for better housing, which has resulted in such projects as Regent Park. He was also responsible for the introduction of resolutions connected with unemployment, slum clearance, relief words programs, public health education, street lighting and city planning. As an impetus to the city plan to raise $1,000,000 for war equipment in 1941, he gave one-fifth of his controller's salary.\n\nHe was first elected mayor with a majority of 22,000 votes. The following day, he modestly confessed that, because of the light poll, he figured he was going down to defeat. In 1942 he received an acclamation. Responding to an appeal to boost Canada's Reserve Army, he joined The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada as a Private and later accompanied his unit to camp at Niagara as Corporal Conboy.\n\nDuring his fourth term, he was elected president of the Canadian Federation of Mayors. He was defeated by Robert Hood Saunders in the election of 1945.\n\nFour times Mayor of Toronto and prominent in the dental profession and welfare service, Conboy was the youngest of James and Sarah Conboy's seven children. He was mayor of Toronto during 1941-42-43-44. He had served previously for four years as controller and two years as alderman in Ward 7. He was a member of the Board of Education from 1909 to 1914, and served a term as chairman.\nConboy was a member of the board of directors of the Social Service Council of Ontario and had been prominent as organizer in social welfare, particularly in his own profession.\n\nA president of the Community Welfare Council of Ontario, Conboy many times stated he felt public officials should be part of a church community. \"I know my work there has been a worthwhile task\", he said, regarding his position as Sunday school superintendent at Westmoreland church. \"Never did a church school have as much responsibility as it has today in these troublous times.\"\n\nIn May 1943, at a convention of the Ontario Dental Association, Conboy was honored. He was presented with an oil portrait of himself (painted by Mr. Cleeve Horne, O.S.A.), which Conboy in turn presented to the University of Toronto to be hung in the Dental Faculty Building. At this presentation, Dr. E.W.Paul, said that Conboy was born in Toronto of humble, sturdy, but highly regarded Irish parents, who instilled in him the fear of God and the importance of hard work.\n\nHis Irish Protestant heritage was again noted on January 4, 1945, by Controller Saunders in his motion to record in the city records an appreciation of Conboy's work. The council stated that \"A great measure of his (Conboy's) success may be attributed to his background of Irish Ancestry and the instilling into his youthful mind by his God-fearing parents, the importance in life of those attributes of honesty, perseverance, sympathy and tolerance and the lesson that men do not break down from overwork but from worry and dissipation.. ...His fine discriminating mind and broad and sympathetic outlook on life have been a tower of strength to his fellow colleagues in Council during the past four years of war fraught with such gave potentiality to the continuance of our present civilization. ...To him this Council gives the assurance that the citizens of Toronto will remember him always with pleasant recollections, as a true Canadian, who has done his full duty as a citizen of Toronto.\"\n\nConboy was, in April 1948, knocked down by a car, at the corner of St. Clair and Oakwood. Two months later he was in the thick of the provincial election as Progressive Conservative candidate in Bracondale and he campaigned with vigor. But the accident had shaken him more than he would admit.\n\nIn the fall of 1948 his health began to fail rapidly. He carried on without complaint until March 19, 1949, when he went to hospital for observation and rest. Two weeks previously his wife was taken to the same hospital for surgical treatment. He died on March 29, 1949, aged 66.\n\nHis death ended a career of outstanding public service. Toronto city council express its regret of his death. The council noted that the late Conboy was active in many organizations having for their objectives \"the promotion of fellowship, the advancement of humanity and the protection of those civil rights and religious privileges gained by the sacrifice and devotion of our forefathers...Conboy was an outstanding citizen of his native city, a man of many parts, endowed with boundless energy, a great organizer and a keen student of municipal government\".\n\nFor 23 of his 66 years he was in public life or in public office and he learned how to take both victory and defeat with equanimity. He was a gracious victor and a good loser.\n\n\nObituaries, Toronto Star, Globe and Telegram.

Initially, this role was referred to as clerk or advocate. The earliest pensionaries in the county of Holland were those of Dordrecht (1468) and of Haarlem (1478). The pensionary conducted the town's legal business and was the secretary of the town council and its representative and spokesman at the meetings of the Provincial States. The post of pensionary was permanent, and he had great influence. \n\nIn the States of the province of Holland the pensionary of the order of nobles \"(Ridderschap)\" was the foremost official of that assembly and, until the death of Oldenbarneveldt in 1619, he was named Land's Advocate, or more shortly the advocate. His importance was much increased after the revolt in 1572, and still more so during the long period 1586–1619 when John van Oldenbarneveldt held the office. \n\nAfter the downfall of Oldenbarneveldt the office of lands advocate was abolished, and a new post, tenable for five years only, was erected in its place with the title of \"Raad-Pensionaris\" or Pensionary of the Council, usually called by English writers Grand Pensionary. The first holders of this office were Anthony Duyck, Jacob Cats and Adrian Pauw, in the days of the stadtholders Frederick Henry and William II of Orange-Nassau had to be content with lessened powers, but in the First Stadtholderless Period (1650–1672) the grand pensionary became even more influential than Oldenbarneveldt himself, since there was no prince of Orange filling the offices of stadtholder, and of admiral and captain-general of the Union. From 1653–1672 Johan de Witt, re-elected twice, made the name of grand pensionary of Holland forever famous during the time of the wars with England. The best known of his successors was Anthony Heinsius, who held the office from 1688 to his death in 1720. He was the intimate friend of William  III, and after the decease of the king continued to carry out his policy during the stadtholderless period that followed. The abolishment of the office occurred after the revolutionaries transformed the \"old\" Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, establishing the new democratic Republic of Batavia, supported by the French forces of the first republic in AD 1795.\n\nThe advocate drew up and introduced all resolutions, concluded debates, and counted the votes in the Provincial Assembly. When it was not in session, he was a permanent member of the college of deputed councilors who carried on the administration. He was the minister of justice and finance.\n\nAll correspondence passed through his hands, and he was the head and the spokesman of the delegation, who represented the province in the States General. The conduct of foreign affairs, in particular, was entrusted almost entirely to him.\n\n\n"}

This unique merger is the only known merger of a Roman Catholic school and an Episcopal school in the United States. The name \"Doane Stuart\" was chosen to honor the first Episcopal Bishop of Albany, the Right Reverend William Croswell Doane, and Roman Catholic educator Janet Erskine Stuart. The first location chosen for Doane Stuart was the campus of the old Kenwood Academy in Albany, New York.

The molecular component can be described as a molecular switch, and may perform this function by any of several mechanisms, including charge storage, photochromism, or changes in capacitance. In a perfect molecular memory device, each individual molecule contains a bit of data, leading to massive data capacity. However, practical devices are more likely to use large numbers of molecules for each bit, in the manner of 3D optical data storage (many examples of which can be considered molecular memory devices). The term \"molecular memory\" is most often used to mean very fast, electronically addressed solid-state data storage, as is the term computer memory. At present, molecular memories are still found only in laboratories.\n\nOne approach to molecular memories is based on special compounds such as porphyrin-based polymers which are capable of storing electric charge. Once a certain voltage threshold is achieved the material oxidizes, releasing an electric charge. The process is reversible, in effect creating an electric capacitor. The properties of the material allow for a much greater capacitance per unit area than with conventional DRAM memory, thus potentially leading to smaller and cheaper integrated circuits.\n\nSeveral universities and a number of companies (Hewlett Packard, ZettaCore) have announced work on molecular memories, which some hope will supplant DRAM memory as the lowest cost technology for high-speed computer memory. NASA is also supporting research on non-volatile molecular memories.\n\nIn 2018, researches from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, developed a molecular memory which can memorize the direction of a magnetic field for long periods of time after being switched off at extremely low temperatures, which would aid in enhancing the storage capacity of hard disk drives without enlarging their physical size.\n\n"}
{"id": "2331097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331097", "title": "Eurythmy", "text": "Eurythmy\n\nEurythmy is an expressive movement art originated by Rudolf Steiner in conjunction with Marie von Sivers in the early 20th century. Primarily a performance art, it is also used in education, especially in Waldorf schools, and – as part of anthroposophic medicine – for claimed therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe word \"eurythmy\" stems from Greek roots meaning \"beautiful\" or \"harmonious rhythm\".\n\nEurythmy was conceived in 1911 when a widow brought her young daughter, Lory Smits, who was interested in movement and dance, to the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner. Due to the recent loss of her father, it was necessary for the girl to find a career. Steiner's advice was sought; he suggested that the girl begin working on a new art of movement. As preparation for this, she began to study human anatomy, to explore the human step, to contemplate the movement implicit in Greek sculpture and dance, and to find movements that would express spoken sentences using the sounds of speech. Soon a number of other young people became interested in this form of expressive movement.\n\nDuring these years, Steiner was writing a new drama each year for performance at the Anthroposophical Society's summer gatherings; beginning in 1912, he began to incorporate the new art of movement into these dramas. When the Society decided to build an artistic center in Dornach, Switzerland (this later became known as the Goetheanum) a small stage group began work and offered weekly performances of the developing art. Marie Steiner-von Sivers, Steiner's wife, who was a trained actress and speech artist, was given responsibility for training and directing this ensemble. This first eurythmy ensemble went on tour in 1919, performing across Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nSteiner saw eurythmy as a unique expression of the anthroposophical impulse:\nAccording to Steiner: \"In eurythmy we present in the form and movement of the human organism a direct external proof of a man's share in the life of the supersensible world. When people do eurythmy they are linked directly with the supersensible world. Whenever art is formed from a truly artistic conviction it bears witness to the connection of the human being with the supersensible world.\" (Dornach, 12 September 1920) \n\nIn 1924, Steiner gave two intensive workshops on different aspects of eurythmy; transcripts of his talks during these workshops are published as \"Eurythmy as Visible Speech\" and \"Eurythmy as Visible Singing\".\n\nEurythmy ensembles in Stuttgart, Germany and at the Goetheanum soon became established parts of the cultural life of Europe. The Goetheanum ensemble was recognized with a gold medal at the Paris Expo of 1937/8. The Stuttgart training and ensemble, led by Else Klink, had to close in the Nazi period but reopened shortly after the close of World War II. There are now training centers and artistic ensembles in many countries.\n\nThe word \"eurythmy\" stems from Greek roots meaning \"beautiful\" or \"harmonious rhythm\". The term was used by Ancient Greek and Roman architects to refer to the harmonious proportions of a design or building; The English word \"eurythmy\" was used from the 17th to 19th century to refer not only to harmonious architectural proportions, but also to \"rhythmical order or movement\" and \"a graceful proportion and carriage of the body\".\n\nThe gestures in the eurythmist's movement repertoire relate to the sounds and rhythms of speech, to the tones and rhythms of music and to \"soul experiences\", such as joy and sorrow. Once these fundamental repertoire elements are learned, they can be composed into free artistic expressions. The eurythmist also cultivates a feeling for the qualities of straight lines and curves, the directions of movement in space (forward, backward, up, down, left, right), contraction and expansion, and color. The element of color is also emphasized both through the costuming, usually given characteristic colors for a piece or part and formed of long, loose fabrics that accentuate the movements rather than the bodily form, and through the lighting, which saturates the space and changes with the moods of the piece.\n\nEurythmy's aim is to bring the artists' expressive movement and both the performers' and audience's feeling experience into harmony with a piece's content; eurythmy is thus sometimes called \"visible music\" or \"visible speech\", expressions that originate with its founder, Rudolf Steiner, who described eurythmy as an \"art of the soul\".\n\nMost eurythmy today is performed to classical (concert) music or texts such as poetry or stories. Silent pieces are also sometimes performed.\n\nWhen performing eurythmy with music (also called \"tone eurythmy\"), the three major elements of music, melody, harmony and rhythm, are all expressed. The melody is primarily conveyed through expressing its rise and fall; the specific pitches; and the intervallic qualities present. Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood. Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) back space, quicker tones into the more active front space.\n\nBreaths or pauses are expressed through a larger or smaller movement in space, giving new impulse to what follows. Beat is conveyed through greater emphasis of downbeats, or those beats upon which stress is normally placed. Beat is generally treated as a subsidiary element. Eurythmy has only occasionally been done to popular music, in which beat plays a large role.\n\nThe timbre of individual instruments is brought into the quality both of the tonal gestures and of the whole movement of the eurythmist. Usually there will be a different eurythmist or group of eurythmists expressing each instrument, for example in chamber or symphonic music.\n\nA piece's choreography usually expresses elements such as the major or minor key, the shape of the melody line, the interplay between voices or instruments and the relative dominance of one or another voice or instrument. Thus, musicians can often follow even the finest details of their part in the movements of the eurythmists on stage. Particular musical forms (e.g. the sonata) can have special characteristic choreographic expressions.\n\nEurythmy is often performed with spoken texts such as poetry, stories or plays. \"Speech eurythmy\" includes such elements as the sounds of speech, rhythms, poetic meters, grammar and mood. In speech eurythmy, all the sounds of language have characteristic gestural qualities: the sound of an 'A' is open due to the position of the articulators during the vowel. A 'k' sounds sharper due to the manner of articulation of the consonant, that it is a plosive. Note that it is the audible sounds themselves, not the letters of the written language, that are expressed.\n\nThere are notable eurythmy ensembles in Dornach, Switzerland; Stuttgart, Germany; The Hague, Netherlands; London, England; Järna, Sweden, and Chestnut Ridge, New York (near New York City). All of these groups both perform locally and tour internationally. Many smaller performing groups also exist (see list). High schools that have their own performing ensembles include the San Francisco Waldorf High School ensemble.\n\nWhen the first Waldorf School was founded in 1919, eurythmy was included in the curriculum. It was quickly recognized as a successful complement to gymnastics in the school's movement program and is now taught in most Waldorf schools, as well as in many non-Waldorf pre-school centers, kindergartens and schools. It is taught to all ages from pre-schools through high school and into college. Its purpose is to awaken and strengthen the expressive capacities of children through movement, stimulating the child to bring imagination, ideation and conceptualization to the point where they can manifest these as \"vital, moving forms\" in physical space. It is also thought to improve balance, coordination, concentration, rhythm, and form an awareness of patterns.\n\nEurythmy pedagogical exercises begin with the straight line and curve and proceed through successively more complicated geometric figures and choreographed forms, developing a child's coordination and concentration. An extensive set of special exercises has also been developed for pedagogical purposes. These include metamorphosing geometric patterns and dynamic movement sequences.\n\nRods or balls are sometimes used in exercises to develop precision in movement, to expand the experience of space, develop precise balance, and to objectify the movement experience. The rods are usually approximately the length of an arm; the balls are of a size to fit comfortably in one hand. Both are generally made of copper, a material receptive to warmth.\n\nThough there are some independent post-graduate trainings for pedagogical eurythmy, this aspect is frequently included in courses focusing on artistic work.\n\nEurythmy is a component of anthroposophic medicine, a system of alternative medicine which has been criticised as unscientific, pseudoscientific and as \"pure quackery\".\n\nAccording to the precepts of anthroposophic medicine, a human has four aspects which need to be treated: spirit, soul, life and matter. Eurythmy is one of the practices said to act on the \"life\" aspect, and is claimed to effect an \"improvement of health related life functions\". A person receiving eurthymy therapy moves under the guidance of a eurythmy therapist, who will have been trained two years beyond the four-year fundamental course in eurythmy. The movements may be adapted to the condition of the person being treated; for example, they may be done while either sitting or even lying down. Therapeutic eurythmy is claimed to bring about a \"re-integration of body, soul, and spirit.\"\n\nA 2008 review in \"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" said that eurythmy was a \"potentially relevant add-on\" to a therapeutic program, but though the studies reviewed reported improvement in symptoms, limitations in the underlying data and in the review methods means these conclusions \"warrant cautious interpretation\".\n\n\n\n"}

Among his notable projects are museums in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne.\n\nOswald Mathias Ungers was born in Kaisersesch in the Eifel region. From 1947 to 1950 he studied architecture at the University of Karlsruhe under Egon Eiermann. He set up an architectural practice in Cologne in 1950, and opened offices in Berlin in 1964, Frankfurt in 1974 and Karlsruhe in 1983.\n\nHe was a professor at the Technical University of Berlin from 1963 to 1967 and served as the dean of the faculty of architecture from 1965 to 1967. In 1968 he moved to the United States, where he became the chair of the department of architecture at Cornell University from 1969 to 1975. In 1971 he became a member of the American Institute of Architects. He was also a visiting professor at Harvard University (1973 and 1978) and the University of California, Los Angeles (1974/75). He returned to Germany in 1976, becoming a visiting professor at the University of Applied Arts Vienna (1979/80) and a full professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (1986).\n\nOswald Mathias Ungers died on 30 September 2007 from pneumonia. He was married to Liselotte Gabler (1926–2010) and had one son (Simon Ungers) and two daughters.\n\nUngers' buildings are characterized by strict geometrical design grid. Basic design elements of his architecture are elementary forms such as square, circle or cube and sphere, which Ungers varied and transformed in his designs. As an architectural theorist and university lecturer, Ungers developed what his critics called \"quadratism\", his admirers \"German rationalism\". In doing so, he resorted to the teaching of Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand who had published in 1820 his pattern books with geometric prototypes for \"any building\". In his formal language, Ungers explicitly referred to elementary architectural design elements that are independent of contemporary tastes. His historical role models in the history of architecture come mainly from Roman-Greek antiquity. His work was therefore occasionally criticized as formalistic. In connection with his construction on the Frankfurt Messe grounds, there was often talk of a \"new clarity\". Like hardly any other architect, Ungers has remained true to his once chosen formal language for decades. He was one of the leading theoreticians of \"Second Modernism\".\n\nWell-known students of Ungers include Max Dudler, Jo. Franzke, Hans Kollhoff, Rem Koolhaas, Christoph Mäckler, Jürgen Sawade and Eun Young Yi.\n\nUngers Archive for Architectural Research contains his architecture library, which he began building in the 1950s, as well as the architect's entire artistic legacy. The library focuses on architecture tractate, works on the emergence and further development of perspective and publications on theory of colour. The library includes the first edition of Vitruv's \"De Architectura Libri Decem\" of 1495 as well as rare editions such as the \"Staatliche Bauhaus in Weimar 1919-1923\" and publications of the Russian avantgarde, for example \"Von zwei Quadraten\" by the architect El Lissitzky. Together with his estate it is housed in the library cube of Ungers' listed building in Belvederestraße 60, Müngersdorf and is available to the scientific public for research purposes.\n\nPart of the Ungers Archive for architectural Research are the models of historical architectural icons which the diploma designer and architectural model builder Bernd Grimm built in collaboration with the architect. Ungers goal was to create a \"three-dimensional collection\" of historically significant buildings. The models are made of white Alabaster gypsum and have a wooden substructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a four-week (formerly six-week prior to 2011, and originally eight-week) summer instructional program for intellectually gifted and artistically talented high school students of Georgia. \n\nRising juniors and seniors in Georgia's public and private high schools may be nominated for the free program by their teachers. The program's entire cost is covered by the state of Georgia. The Governor's Honors Program began in 1964 with 400 participants and was hosted at Wesleyan College. It took place at Valdosta State University from 1980 through 2016 (sometimes cohosted at North Georgia College in Dahlonega), but relocated in 2017 to Berry College in Rome, Georgia.\n\nThere is no cost to attend GHP for students. Tuition, room, and board are covered under appropriations made by the Georgia General Assembly. However, students are asked to bring basic school supplies (binders, notebook paper, notebooks, pens, etc.) for class. GHP is an ungraded summer program. Students are not required to take any exit exams or standardized tests regarding major courses of study. Credits are not issued for completion of the program. Students that complete the entire four weeks of study receive a certificate of completion.\n\nStudents are nominated in a specific instructional area in which their abilities, aptitudes, and interest lie. Each school system or private school is assigned a nomination quota based on the average daily attendance of its 10th and 11th grades.\nTranscripts of grades and records, nomination forms, endorsements and other pertinent information are submitted to substantiate the nominations. Selected nominees then submit written essays and/or videos of their work. Each district or county has a different nomination process. From there, selected applicants are sent to statewide screening interviews/auditions.\n\nThe written evidence and data gathered in the student interview/audition are used to rank nominees and select finalists.\n\nThe overall acceptance rate of the program in 2017 was 21%.\n\nIn 2017, 58% of GHP students were from metro area public schools, 32% of students were from non-metro area public schools, and 10% of students were from private schools or were home schooled.\n\nMajor instructional areas are communicative arts (English), Spanish, French, Latin, German, Mandarin Chinese, mathematics, science, agricultural science, social studies, visual arts, theatre performance, theatre design, music (woodwinds, piano, brass, strings, vocal, and percussion), dance, and engineering (design, mechanical, and software). Staff in four support areas (Counseling, Fitness, Computers, and Library/Media) also work to assist the student body.\n\nIn 2017, the program hosted 450 students in academic major areas and 217 students in fine arts major areas. Among that student population were 72 world language majors, 75 communicative arts majors, 78 social studies majors, 225 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) majors, 32 dance majors, 35 theatre majors, 46 visual arts majors, and 104 music majors.\n\nStudents may choose an elective in the first week of the program. The electives are commonly known as minors and include all the major areas of study along with others including Journalism, Counseling, Education, Ballroom dancing, Gender Studies, and Songwriting. \n\nEach student receives 4.5 hours of major subject time on Mondays to Saturdays and 2 hours of elective subject time on Mondays to Fridays. Other time is free for meals, research, performances, practice, or seminars (see below).\n\nGHP instructors are chosen according to their experience and recommendations. The student to teacher ratio is mandated to be at or very close to 15:1. In 2017, the student to faculty ratio was 13:1.\n\nResidential Advisors and faculty host seminars outside of instructional time, ranging from learning Hebrew to making friendship bracelets\n\nThe following are notable alumni of the Georgia Governor's Honors Program, listed with their GHP major, year of attendance, and notable accomplishments:\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 17, 1994. In the episode, Lisa challenges the makers of the Malibu Stacy doll to create a less sexist doll. Together with the original creator of Malibu Stacy, Stacy Lovell, Lisa creates the doll Lisa Lionheart in an effort to positively influence young girls.\n\nThe episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode's plot was inspired by the Teen Talk Barbie talking doll, which spoke short phrases typical of a middle-class American teenager. Kathleen Turner guest starred in the episode as Stacy Lovell, creator of Malibu Stacy. It features cultural references to action figures such as Ken and G.I. Joe. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.6, and was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nDr. Hibbert introduces a frail Ben Matlock to a crowd of excited seniors at the grand opening of a geriatric medical center. After seeing Matlock mobbed to the ground by fans, Grampa becomes aware of his mortality and gives the family their inheritance early. He leaves them a box of old silver dollars which they decide to spend right away. \n\nDuring the entire trip to the mall and back home, Grampa tells far-fetched stories and spouts useless advice, making the family shun him. At the mall, Lisa buys the new talking Malibu Stacy doll. She is anxious to hear what the new doll says, but is disappointed when the doll utters sexist phrases such as \"Thinking too much gives you wrinkles\" and \"Don't ask me, I'm just a girl.\" After Lisa and Grampa bemoan how they are treated because of their age, they decide to change: Grampa will get a job and Lisa will find Malibu Stacy's creator, Stacy Lovell.\n\nLisa visits Waylon Smithers, owner of the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection. She asks his help in finding Lovell, who was ousted from the Malibu Stacy company in 1974 (due to her ideas not being considered cost-effective — and for funneling profits to the Viet Cong). Lisa bikes to Lovell's house and plays one of the doll's phrases over the intercom. The gate immediately opens. Lisa and Lovell decide to create a new talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll, designed to look more realistic than Malibu Stacy, says inspirational and encouraging phrases for girls. The executives of Malibu Stacy learn of its development and worry that Lisa's doll poses a real threat to their sales.\n\nGrampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-thru and losing his false teeth when a coworker accidentally puts them in a customer's bag of burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated and quits. \n\nAfter a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among Malibu Stacy fans after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. As kids and Smithers rush to the mall to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled into their path. Lisa tells them the new Malibu Stacy is only the same doll with a cheap hat, but they ransack the Malibu Stacy cart after Smithers gushes over the new model. When\none little girl selects a Lisa Lionheart doll, Lisa says the trouble of designing and marketing the doll was worth it. Stacy Lovell agrees, especially if that one little girl pays $46,000 to cover Lisa Lionheart's costs.\n\nThe episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. Before the episode aired, Malibu Stacy had already appeared many times on the show as one of Lisa's dolls. The staff were trying to come up with an idea for an episode by going through the companies in the \"Simpsons\" universe, and Oakley suggested an episode involving the Malibu Stacy company. The plot of the episode was inspired by the Teen Talk Barbie talking doll that caused controversy in the United States in the early 1990s. In July 1992, Mattel released Teen Talk Barbie, which spoke a number of phrases including \"Will we ever have enough clothes?\", \"I love shopping!\", and \"Wanna have a pizza party?\" Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that no two dolls were likely to be the same. One of these 270 phrases was \"Math class is tough!\". Although only about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase, it led to criticism from the American Association of University Women because they regarded it as demeaning to women. In October 1992, Mattel announced that Teen Talk Barbie would no longer say the phrase, and offered a swap to anyone who owned a doll that did.\n\nOakley and Weinstein decided to include Abe in the episode because they had an \"obsession\" with old people. Weinstein said they both \"love them and seem to really hate them\" at the same time. He also said that they enjoy writing for characters such as Abe and Mr. Burns because of their \"out-datedness\", and because he and Oakley get to use dictionaries for looking up \"old time slang\". Executive producer David Mirkin thought it was difficult to make Abe funny because he is a \"boring and tedious\" character. He thinks that even though \"Abe's doing all these complaints, what makes him funny is that the things he says are actually funny in the context of the boring and tedium.\" Mirkin thought this was a \"big challenge, and Bill and Josh pulled it off very well.\"\n\nWhen the episode was in production, Oakley's wife Rachel Pulido was an enthusiastic Barbie collector. Oakley therefore spent a lot of time going to Barbie conventions across the United States and met many different collectors. At one convention, Oakley met the man who owned the world's largest Barbie collection. The meeting between the two inspired the part of the episode where Lisa visits Smithers and it is revealed that Smithers is the owner of the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection. Kathleen Turner guest starred in the episode as Stacy Lovell. Mirkin thought Turner was \"completely game\" when she showed up at the recording studio to record her lines as she \"nailed\" her lines really fast. He added that he enjoyed directing her and he thought she had one of the best performances ever on \"The Simpsons\".\n\n At the beginning of the episode, Abe watches his idol Ben Matlock talk to a crowd of excited seniors at the Grand Opening of the Center for Geriatric Medicine. Ben Matlock is a character from the NBC/ABC television series \"Matlock\", portrayed by Andy Griffith and created by Dean Hargrove. The crowd cheer for Matlock by singing a slightly changed version of the \"We Love You, Conrad\" song from stage musical \"Bye Bye Birdie\". Homer dances on giant piano keys recessed in the floor of the toy store, spoofing a scene from the 1988 film \"Big\". Lisa wants Lisa Lionheart to have \"the wisdom of Gertrude Stein, the wit of Cathy Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina Totenberg, the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt.\"\n\nStacy Lovell's list of husbands features the action figures Ken, Johnny West, G.I. Joe, Doctor Colossus, and Steve Austin. Lisa's story about the Malibu Stacy doll saying phrases that are considered demeaning to women is based on the \"Teen Talk Barbie\" line of dolls and how they caused controversy. During one scene in the episode, one girl's Malibu Stacy doll says \"My Spidey Sense is tingling! Anyone call for a web-slinger?\", a reference to a practical joke by the Barbie Liberation Organization in the early 1990s in which the voiceboxes of talking Barbie and G.I. Joe toys were swapped.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy\" finished 23rd in the ratings for the week of February 14–20, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 11.6, equivalent to 11 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"Beverly Hills, 90210\".\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was \"good but not great\", despite \"more than a few strong moments, like the hilarious shot of Bart at the gay rights parade.\" He added that \"most years this would be an A-list program, but it’s one of season five’s lesser lights despite a generally high level of quality.\" The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described the episode as \"Lisa at her crusading best, Homer at his stupidest and Abe getting all the best lines again, especially at Krusty Burgers. Kathleen Turner's spot as the real Malibu Stacy is superb.\" \n\nJanica Lockhart of \"The Easterner\" called the episode a \"classic\" and added: \"The episode takes on misogynist views, but in a humorous way, that only \"The Simpsons\" can master.\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A. DVD Talk's Bill Gibron gave it a score of 5 out of 5. \n\nThe episode is one of Oakley and Weinstein's favorites from their time as writers on the show. When \"The Simpsons\" began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service. One of Mirkin's favorite jokes on the show is the scene in this episode where Abe cycles down the street, shouting \"Look at me, I'm acting young!\" before Lisa's Malibu Stacy doll catches the front wheel of the bike, sending Abe flying into an open grave. \n\nIn the book \"\", Aeon J. Skoble cited the episode as an example in his piece titled: \"Do We Admire or Laugh at Lisa?\". He wrote: \"The fact that the less intellectual doll is vastly preferred over Lisa's doll, even though Lisa's objections are reasonable, demonstrates the ways in which reasonable ideas can be made to take a back seat to having fun and going with the flow. This debate is often played out in the real world, of course: Barbie is the subject of perennial criticism along the lines of Lisa's\ncritique of Malibu Stacy, yet remains immensely popular, and in general, we often see\nintellectual critiques of toys dismissed as 'out of touch' or elitist.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2331112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331112", "title": "Madelung synthesis", "text": "Madelung synthesis\n\nThe Madelung synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces (substituted or unsubstituted) indoles by the intramolecular cyclization of N-phenylamides using strong base at high temperature.The Madelung synthesis was reported in 1912 by Walter Madelung, when he observed that 2-phenylindole was synthesized using N-benzoyl-o-toluidine and two equivalents of sodium ethoxide in a heated, airless, reaction. Common reaction conditions include use of sodium or potassium alkoxide as base in hexane or tetrahydrofuran solvents, at temperatures ranging between 200–400 °C. A hydrolysis step is also required in the synthesis. The Madelung synthesis is important because it is one of few known reactions that produce indoles from a base-catalyzed thermal cyclization of N-acyl-o-toluidines. The overall reaction for the Madelung synthesis follows.\n\nThis method is essentially confined to the preparation of 2-alkinylindoles (not easily accessible through electrophilic aromatic substitution) because of the vigorous reaction conditions. A detailed reaction mechanism for the Madelung synthesis follows.\n\nThe reaction begins with the extraction of a hydrogen from the nitrogen of the amide substituent and the extraction of a benzylic hydrogen from the substituent ortho to the amide substituent by a strong base. Next, the carbanion resulting from the benzylic hydrogen extraction performs a nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the amide group. When this occurs, the pi-bond of the amide is converted into a lone pair, creating a negatively charged oxygen. After these initial steps, strong base is no longer required and hydrolysis must occur. The negatively charged nitrogen is protonated to regain its neutral charge, and the oxygen is protonated twice to harbor a positive charge in order to become a good leaving group. A lone pair from the nitrogen forms a pi-bond to expel the positively charged leaving group, and also causes the nitrogen to harbor a positive charge. The final step of the reaction is an elimination reaction (specifically an E2 reaction), which involves the extraction of the other hydrogen that was once benzylic, before the bicyclic compound was formed, whose electrons are converted into a new pi-bond in the ring system. This allows the pi-bond formed by nitrogen in the preceding step to be converted back into a lone pair on nitrogen to restore nitrogen's neutral charge.\n\nVarious techniques have been applied to increase the yield of the desired indole product. When the aromatic ring has electron-donating substituents higher yields are obtained, and the opposite is true when the aromatic ring has electron-withdrawing substituents. However, when the R5 substituent is an electron-withdrawing substituent, the yield is increased instead of decreased. Additionally, the efficiency of the reaction is also heavily dependent on the bulkiness of the R6 substituent. The bulkier this group, the less efficient is the reaction. \nThe conditions required for the Madelung synthesis are quite severe. Fortunately, the aforementioned modifications have been since applied to enhance its practicality, working to decrease the required temperature at which the reaction is performed and increase the desired product yield. For example, when electron-donating are placed on the aromatic ring of the N-phenylamide and an electron-withdrawing substituent is substituted at R5, the required temperature for the reaction decreases to approximately 25 °C. Even more impressively, researchers have discovered that the required temperature for the Madelung synthesis decreases to a temperature range of −20 – 25 °C when butyl lithium (BuLi) and lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) bases are used, and when tetrahydrofuran is used as the solvent. This particular modification, the use of either of these metal-mediated bases, is termed the Madelung-Houlihan variation.\n\nThe Madelung synthesis has many important applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and industrial chemistry. This reaction served useful in synthesizing, with an 81% yield, the architecturally complex tremorgenic indole alkaloid (-)-penitrem D, a molecule naturally produced by ergot fungus that causes various muscular and neurological diseases in livestock. Because this toxin ultimately causes significant economic problems in the livestock industry, understanding how to synthesize and easily decompose alkaloid (-)-penitrem D is of great importance. Nonetheless, the synthesis of such a complex molecule was, by itself, an incredible feat. \nAnother facet through which the Madelung synthesis has served useful is in the synthesis of 2,6-diphenyl-1,5-diaza-1,5-dihydro-s-indacene, from 2,5-dimethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine. This synthesis was performed without modification to the Madelung synthesis, using sodium ethoxide base at a temperature of 320 – 330 °C. This indacene has shown to be an organic light-emitting diode that may have important applications for low-cost light displays in commercial industry.\n\nThe Smith-modified Madelung synthesis, also called the Smith indole synthesis, was discovered in 1986 by Amos Smith and his research team. This synthesis employs a condensation reaction of organolithium reagents derived from 2-alkyl-N-trimethylsilyl anilines by esters or carboxylic acids to yield substituted indoles. This synthesis has proven applicable to a wide variety of substituted anilines, including those with alkyl, methoxy, and halide groups, and can react with non-enolizable esters or lactones to yield N-lithioketamine intermediates. These intermediates then undergo intramolecular heteroatom Peterson olefination to yield indolinines, which then tautomerize to 2-substituted indoles. The Smith indole synthesis is one of the most important modifications to the Madelung synthesis.\n\nThe Smith indole synthesis begins by use of two equivalents of an organolithium reagent (as organolithium reagents are very strong bases) to extract a hydrogen from both the alkyl substituent and the nitrogen, resulting in a negative charge on both. The synthesis proceeds with a nucleophilic attack of the carbanion on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ester or carboxylic acid. When this occurs, the pi-bond of the electrophile is converted into a lone pair on the oxygen. These lone pairs are then reconverted back into a pi-bond, resulting in the expulsion of the -OR group. Next, the negatively charged nitrogen performs a nucleophilic attack on the adjacent electrophilic carbonyl carbon, again causing the pi-bond of the electrophile to be converted into a lone pair on the oxygen. This negatively charged oxygen then performs a nucleophilic attack on the silicon atom of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group, resulting in a tricyclic compound, and a positively charged silicon atom and neutral oxygen atom. The synthesis proceeds through an intramolecular heteroatom Peterson olefination, ultimately resulting in an elimination reaction which expels a TMSO group and forms a pi-bond in the five-membered ring at the nitrogen atom. Then, keto-enol tautomerism occurs, resulting in the desired product.\n"}

Like his contemporaries Danwon and Geungjae, he is known for his realistic depictions of daily life in his time. His genre paintings are distinctly more erotic than Danwon's, a fact which contributed to his expulsion from the royal painting institute, Dohwaseo. Painting was frequently a hereditary occupation in the Joseon period, and Hyewon's father and grandfather had both been court painters. Together with Danwon and the later painter Owon, Hyewon is remembered today as one of the \"Three Wons\" of Joseon-period painting.\n\nHe is Shin Mal Joo's descendant who was a scholar of the early Joseon Dynasty.\n\nNot much is known about Shin Yun-bok's life. He was the son of royal court painter Hanpyeong (한평; 漢枰), who had participated in painting the royal portraits of Yeongjo and Jeongjo. Hyewon reached the official rank of \"cheomjeoljesa\" (첨절제사; 僉節制使) at the Dohwaseo and was adept at different styles of painting; genre, landscape, and animals. It is speculated that he left a great number of paintings due to the popularity of genre paintings during that era.\n\nThere are different studies and theories regarding his life, that he may not have ever been a member of the Dohwaseo nor was he on close terms with Kim Hong-do.\n\nShin Yun-bok, despite being greatly influenced and overshadowed by Kim Hong-do during his career, developed his own unique technique and artistry. Along with Kim Hong-Do, he is known foremost for his genre paintings of the Joseon era. Whereas Kim depicted everyday life of peasants with a humorous touch, Shin showed glimpses of eroticism in his paintings of townspeople and \"gisaeng\". His choice of characters, composition, and painting method differed from Kim's, with use of bright colors and delicate paint strokes. He also painted scenes of shamanism and townlife, offering insight to lifestyle and costumes of the late Joseon era.\n\nHis ink landscape paintings used clear light strokes in a method similar to that of Yun Je-hong (윤제홍), the pioneer in new style painting of the late Joseon era. He is also known to not have used the traditional method of leaving empty space in his paintings, usually filling the whole canvas. Although he placed short verse and his seal on most of his paintings, none indicate the date nor time of their creation and it is difficult to define the progression of his painting style. As one of the pillars of genre painting in the Joseon era, he influenced many other painters afterwards.\n\nHis album, \"Hyewon Pungsokhwacheop\", contains 30 of his paintings and was designated the 135th National Treasure of South Korea in 1970.\n\n\nSix paintings from the Yeosokdo Album (여속도첩):\nFour paintings from the Pungsokdo Album.

The title is said to be a reference to Wilson's corruption of a line from Hamlet: \"Angels and ministers of grace defend us!\" (1.4.39).\n\nOriginally, Wilson intended the fantastical scenarios he envisioned to actually be staged. When he realized the enormous costs and effort that would be involved in performing such a project (which included such tableaux as a gigantic hand pulling a sword from the ocean and a helicopter flying over the Great Wall of China), Wilson and producer Jed Wheeler began looking into creating the entire visual end of the production with 3D computer graphics. Wheeler eventually awarded the contract for the visual effects to the Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co., a firm that specializes in computer animation for movies.\n\nOne major drawback that seems to have been the project's main flaw was the length of time required for creating and rendering the animation. It took twenty animators almost a full year to complete the footage based on Wilson's original intent. Wilson, who has been described as liking to maintain great control over his projects and to change details at the last minute, gradually grew frustrated upon seeing how much time was required to change the animations, and ended up distancing himself from the animators. This led to a final product that, from his standpoint, was unpolished. In an interview with the \"New York Times\", he remarked, \"This is like being a dog with a litter of puppies that went away six weeks later. . . . Here I was working with people who didn't know my work, in a medium I didn't know.\"\nIt premiered in its finished form on 9 September 1998, at Wolf Trap in Vienna, Virginia. The opera was performed with live music by the Philip Glass Ensemble while a 73-minute computer-animated film in 3D was projected above the musicians. The audience wore polarized glasses to view the effect.\n\nAlthough the work was initially greatly anticipated, it met with mixed reviews by critics (it was booed by some audience members following an April 1999 performance in Toronto, Ontario), and Wilson himself has remarked negatively about the project in interviews. \"Monsters of Grace\" had its last performance on 22 July 1999, in Athens, Greece.\n\n\n"}

The root of the name Ceilândia is \"CEI\" ().\n\nIn 1969, after only nine years of existence, Brasília already had 79,128 people living in irregular occupations, out of a population of 500 thousand inhabitants in all the Federal District.

The Governor at that time, Hélio Prates da Silveira, decided to eradicate the invasions and a commission was formed.\n\n17619 lots were laid out and in 1970 the first construction began. In nine months the transfer of the families was concluded with the streets opened In the beginning it was dramatic. The population had no water, no public lighting, no public transport and fought against the dust, the mud and the flash floods.\n\nToday Ceilândia is the largest electoral college of the Federal District and the most populous city, with more inhabitants than the Pilot Plan. It occupies a total of 91 residential squares laid out like Brasília, intercalated by areas for local commerce, churches and schools. There are also some special areas that are set aside to provide community services.\nAn active commercial center, it has 4,500 commercial establishments and 1,600 small industries. The economically active population is more than 160,000 people.\n\nTwo important locals of Ceilandia are the ' (Water Tower), and the ' (House of the Singer), a cultural center dedicated to the artists of Northeast Brazil. The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer and completed in 1986.\n\nCeilândia is considered the second largest \"Northeastern city\" outside the Brazilian Northeast Region (the first one is São Paulo). About 70% of the population is of Northeastern origin. The presence of the Northeast culture can be seen in the number of open-air fairs (13 in all).\n\nThe fairs (\") are also an alternative for the workers that did not find space in the economy of the Federal District. In most of them, fruits, foods, clothes and footwear are commercialized. The Fair of the Producer () sells wholesale and supplies almost 50% of the Federal District.\n\nThe Central Fair (), is the largest of all. It occupies an area of seven thousand square meters and sells household articles, tools, electric appliances, fruits, vegetables, and poultry. It is located next to the \" (Water Tower) - the symbol of Ceilândia.\n\nBut the most peculiar fair, without doubt, is the , where one can find almost everything, new or used, entire or broken, and things there can be sold or exchanged.\n\n\n"}

It has a population of 13,091 inhabitants (2011 census). Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Rafina-Pikermi, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 18.979 km.\n\nRafina lies on the Aegean Sea coast, east of the Penteli mountains and northeast of the Mesogaia plain. It is north of Artemida, south of Nea Makri and east of Athens city centre. The municipal unit of Rafina contains, besides the city itself, a large portion of the surrounding area, which is mostly woodland and farmland. The only other town is Kallitechnoupoli with a population of 923.\n\nThe town can be accessed through Greek National Road 54 (Athens – Rafina), Greek National Road 83 (Athens – Marathon – Rafina) and Greek National Road 85 (Lavrio – Rafina).\n\nRafina is a port town serving ferries to the southern part of Euboea as well as most of the Cyclades. Its port is the second largest of Attica, after that of Piraeus, but it will probably be superseded by the one in Lavrio, which is currently being expanded.\n\nRafina was inhabited in prehistoric times. The oldest finds are from the Neolithic Period, and a large number date from the Bronze Age (3,000 years B.C.), discovered by the excavations of Dimitrios Theocharis in '50s: a settlement on the hill above the port, bronze processing facilities near the delta of the Great Stream, and a Protohelladic Akropolis in the cape of Askitario which you can visit today.\n\nIn ancient times, Rafina was one of the 100 demes of Athens as defined by Kleisthenes. The municipality was called \"Araphen\", after its first ruler, Arafinas, who was one of the 100 heroes of Attica. In the municipality of Arafin, lived one of the ten breeds of Attica. Also, the area near the sea till Artemida, called \"Halae Araphenides\" is where Orestis and Ifigenia arrived from Tavrida according to the myth.\n\nFrom later centuries, excavations discovered Roman baths and the remains of a Byzantine Church.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Greek army in the Minor Asia (1922), many refugees arrived in Greece. Some of them arrived in the area by Triglia, with ships owned by Filippos Kabounides, a Triglian shipowner, who arrived at the time of the destruction to save people and heirlooms.\n\nA year later (August 29, 1923), Kabounides' ships brought to Rafina refugees who have lived in Tenedos for one year. After a few months, the first houses of the new refugee settlement were built and were located at the Skouze's estate that was given to the refugees. Also, around the area of the square, small shops were built and given to shop owners.\n\nSix years later (1929), Rafina became a community.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Pantovasilissa's church was built in remembrance of the Byzantine church in Triglia which held the same name. At its forecourt was erected a statue of the metropolite of Smyrni, Chrysostomos, who was killed by the Turks during the destruction. Many years later, people in Rafina built a little church to his memory.\n\nWhen Triglians arrived from Asia Minor, they brought many things from their old country, the most important being \"Panagia Episkepsis\", a hagiography created during the 14th century A.D., which one can now see in the Byzantine Museum in Athens. A copy can be found in the city hall of Rafina.\n\nMany heirlooms can be found in the Refugee Museum \"Triglia's House\", where visitors can see many originals or their copies.\n\nDuring the Second World War, and during the German Occupation, German and Italian armies were installed in Rafina. Important projects for the guarding and the vallation of the area were built at the port, along the seaside and on the hill that was since named \"Fort\".\n\nIn 1994, Rafina became a municipality and its first mayor was Andreas Kechagioglou, who kept his office until November 2011 when Rafina integrated with Pikermi as part of the Kallikratis plan. Following the planned municipal elections, Giorgios Christopoulos was elected Mayor for the new municipality of Rafina and Pikermi. During the past few years, the town has advanced significantly. Its population reaches about 12,000 people, and climbs to 30,000–50,000 during the summer. During the summer, many events take part in the town such as the \"August's Moon\", which takes place in August when the last full moon of August occurs. During this day, many musicians gather outside the church of St. Nikolaos and sing songs about the moon.\n\nRafina suffered damage from a forest fire in July 2005 and again in 2018.\n\nRafina is the seat of two football clubs with presence in third national division (Gamma Ethniki), Triglia Rafina, club founded in 1932 by refugees, and Thyella Rafina, club founded in 1957.\n\nRafina is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

He was raised in Prairie Village, Kansas. He graduated from Indiana University and was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. Fehr received his law degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.\n\nAs a young lawyer, Fehr assisted the MLBPA in the Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally arbitration case (later known as the Seitz decision). In 1977, Marvin Miller hired Fehr as the Players Association general counsel.\n\nIn December 1985, Fehr was voted executive director of the MLBPA after having served as acting director since December 9, 1983. Fehr successfully challenged the owners' collusion, leading to the owners paying $280 million in damages to the players.\n\nFehr led the players union through the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike and subsequent World Series cancellation. He was instrumental in implementing the rejection of future admissions into the MLBPA of replacement players who planned to fill in during the strike of 1995. Fehr attended the 1995 New York Yankees' home opener against the Texas Rangers, which saw only 50,425 fans show up making it was the smallest opening day crowd at Yankee Stadium since 1990. Fehr's presence angered many fans who blamed him for ruining their team's postseason chances and what would have been Don Mattingly's postseason debut. Fans booed Fehr and yelled \"You ruined the game!\" in response to him having attended the last game played at Yankee Stadium before the strike, and booed as he left the stadium; one fan also held up a sign saying \"\"$HAME ON YOU!\"\", to which Fehr responded by flipping off the fan.\n\nOn June 22, 2009, Fehr announced his intention to step down as the MLBPA executive director position, recommending Michael Weiner as his successor. This was subject to the approval of the union's executive board and possible ratification by all players. He officially relinquished his job to Weiner in December 2009.\n\nShortly after leaving his position as Executive Director of the MLBPA, Fehr took up a position as an advisor to the NHL Players' Association. On December 18, 2010, Fehr was voted in by the NHLPA as their executive director.\n\nWith the NHL locking out the players at midnight on September 15, 2012, Fehr became the only Executive Director of a players union to be directly involved in work stoppages in two sports. Six of the eight contract negotiations he has been involved in have resulted in work stoppages, including five consecutive negotiations between the MLBPA and Major League Baseball.\n\n This chapter in Ruttman's oral history, based on an April 24, 2009 interview with Fehr conducted for the book, discusses Fehr's American, Jewish, baseball, and life experiences from youth to the present.\n\n"}

Its name stands for \"CRUcianelli and MARchetti\", the names of Crucianelli and business partner Marchetti. The company appears to have grown out of the Crucianelli accordion company and also continued to manufacture accordions under both names.\n\nCrumar started out manufacturing electronic pianos and string synthesizers, such as the Compac-piano (1972/1973), Compac-string (1973), Pianoman (1974) and Stringman (1974), the functions of which were combined in 1975 with the Multiman (also known as the Orchestrator), and in 1977 with the Multiman-S. The company was also known for \"clonewheel\" organs made in the 70's and 80's, such as the Organizer (1974), Organizer T1 (1978) and T1/C (1981), T2 (1978), and T3 (1981).\n\nIn 1978, Crumar released their first full-fledged synthesizer, the DS-2, which had one of the earliest digitally controlled oscillators (DCO).\nCrumar synthesizers are comparable and contemporaneous to Moog synthesizers and other analog synthesizers; in fact, the Crumar Spirit synthesizer (1983) was designed by Bob Moog himself, along with Minimoog co-designer Jim Scott and Tom Rhea (who wrote Moog manuals). In 1984, Crumar began producing polyphonic synthesizers utilizing DCOs under the Bit name (Unique in the US)\".\" The Performer is a polyphonic analog Strings and Brass machine produced at the end of the 1970s and is slightly compact with just 49 keys and is fully polyphonic (can play all 49 notes simultaneously). Programming is simple and clearly laid-out with just 15 sliders and a few buttons. A solid black chassis and wood end-cheeks round out this classic and often overlooked string machine. The Performer is best remembered for its Strings more so than its Brass and was used by Duran Duran.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Crumar formed a design/distribution collaborative with New York-based Music Technology (MT) in an effort to commercialize the Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer. Crumar and the MT designers worked in conjunction with some respected names in electronic music to produce the Crumar GDS (General Development System) in 1980, and the Digital keyboards Synergy in 1981. These synthesizers, which used additive synthesis technology and phase modulation, were bulky and cumbersome, but were state-of-the-art at the time. The complexity of this project, along with Japanese competition (notably from the Yamaha DX7) contributed to the company's eventual downfall.\n\nCrumar ceased trading in 1987, just as they were about to launch a high-quality sampler at the lower end of the market.\n\nIn 2008 the Crumar brand was acquired by a new Italian company that soon began producing new keyboards under the Crumar name, including the Baby Grand piano (introduced at the 2008 Musikmesse), Bassman bass synth, and Mojo clonewheel organ.\n\nIn 2018 a digital electric piano called Seven was introduced. It featured modern day technology in a wooden vintage 1970's style case.\n\n\n\n"}

Schooldigger.com ranked the school tied for 40th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (an increase of 8 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (93.1%) and language arts literacy (98.0%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).\n\nIn the 2016 \"Ranking America's School Districts\" issue by \"Niche.com\", the district was ranked 10th in New Jersey and 81st nationwide.\n\nIn its 2013 report on \"America's Best High Schools\", \"The Daily Beast\" ranked the school 157th in the nation among participating public high schools and 10th overall (and fourth of non-magnet schools) among schools in New Jersey. The school was ranked 224th in the nation and 19th in New Jersey on the list of \"America's Best High Schools 2012\" prepared by \"The Daily Beast\" / \"Newsweek\", with rankings based primarily on graduation rate, matriculation rate for college and number of Advanced Placement / International Baccalaureate courses taken per student, with lesser factors based on average scores on the SAT / ACT, average AP/IB scores and the number of AP/IB courses available to students.\n\nThe New Providence High School Pioneers compete in the Union County Interscholastic Athletic Conference, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). With 514 students in grades 10−12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2015−16 school year as Central Jersey, Group II for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 498 to 750 students in that grade range. Prior to the realignment that took place in 2010, the school had participated in the Mountain Valley Conference. NPHS's teams have won multiple state championships in sports such as track & field, baseball, basketball, football, soccer, tennis, golf, swimming, and wrestling.\n\nThe school participates in a joint ice hockey program with Governor Livingston High School as the host school / lead agency, under an agreement that expires at the end of the 2017−18 school year.\n\nThe NJSIAA recognized Delsea as Group I winner of the ShopRite Cup for 2010−11, awarded for first-place finishes in girls' soccer, football and girls' basketball; tied for third in boys' tennis and fourth place girls' indoor group track & field, plus bonus points for having no disqualifications for the fall, winter and spring seasons.\n\nThe boys' basketball team won the Group I state championship in 1965 (defeating Wildwood High School in the tournament final) and 1999 (vs. Highland Park High School); The girls' team won the Group I title in 2010 (vs. Florence Township Memorial High School) and 2011 (vs. Haddon Township High School).\n\nThe Pioneers have had three state wrestling champions: John Ferrara (1969), Rich Billitz (1976) and Donnie DeFilippis (1999, who came in second twice before winning the title). On March 13, 2012 DeFilippis was inducted into the Region 3 Hall of Fame for his accomplishments in High School and on the Division 1 level in college. The wrestling team won the North II Group I state sectional championship in 1983, 1992 and 1994, and won the Central Jersey Group I title in 2005.\n\nThe football team won the North II Group II state sectional championship in 1974 and 1976, and won the North II Group I title in 1987, 1988, 1989 and 2010. Head football coach Frank Bottone finished the 2006 season with his 300th career victory, the fourth coach in New Jersey history to achieve that milestone. The only coach in New Providence's school history since the football program began in 1963, Bottone compiled a record of 334−125−7 in his 46 seasons before he retired after the 2010 season. His teams won 15 conference championships and eight state sectional championships, including an undefeated season in 1989 when the Pioneers went 11−0 with 9 shutouts, cumulatively outscoring their opponents 234−20. The two teams that scored against the Pioneers that season were Middlesex High School (43−13) and David Brearley High School of Kennilworth (35−7); none of the scores were against their first string defense. The following year, Anthony Pignio represented NPHS in the North vs. South All star game, where he won MVP honors. Other stand-outs include Ted Blackwell who set the New Jersey High School record for points in a season with 254 points. Bottone called it a career at the end of the 2010 season, his 49th season overall in New Providence. The Pioneers went 10–1 en route to the North II, Group I state championship with a 21–8 victory against Lincoln High School of Jersey City.\n\nThe baseball team won the Group II state championship in 1990 (defeating Hightstown High School in the final game of the tournament) and 1998 (vs. Middlesex High School). Former head baseball coach Tom Beck was inducted into the NJSIAA Hall of Fame in 2007. He won numerous Mountain Valley Conference championships along with two state sectional titles and a Group I state championship in 1998. In 1990, after winning their state sectional and North Jersey championships, Beck's team came up just short in the Group I state championship, losing 1−0 despite pitcher Ernie Schmidt throwing a no-hitter, and allowing no walks in the contest. Schmidt had a perfect game until the 6th inning when a passed ball on a dropped third strike led to a run scored without any hits.\n\nThe boys' soccer team won the 2003 NJSIAA North II Group I sectional championship with a 1–0 win over David Brearley High School. In 2007 the boys soccer team won the 2007 NJSIAA Central Group I Sectional Championship with a 3–2 win in over time against Metuchen High School. Alex Pellas scored the winning goal with around 4 minutes to go in the first overtime. The 2007 boys soccer team also won the Mountain Valley Conference. They went undefeated in their conference and finished with an 18–3–1 record. They lost to Arthur P. Schalick High School in the Group I semi-finals 2-0.\n\nThe girls' soccer team has won the Group I state championship four times: in 2000 (as co-champion in with Haddon Township High School), 2003 (as co-champion with Glen Rock High School), 2010 (vs. Pennsville Memorial High School) and 2011 (vs. Haddon Township High School). In 2004 they won the Central Jersey Group I sectional championship and MVC conference. In 2010, the girls' soccer team defeated Pennsville by s 1-0 score in the tournament final for the Group I state title. In 2011, the team repeated as Group I champion with a 4-0 win in the tournament final against Haddon Township.\n\nThe 2007 girls' tennis team won the Central Jersey, Group I state sectional championship with a 5−0 win over Bound Brook High School in the tournament final. The team moved on to win the Group I state championship with a 3−2 win over County Prep High School in the semifinals and Pennsville Memorial High School in the finals by a 3−2 score. The 2008 girls tennis team won the North II, Group I state sectional championship with a 4−1 win over County Prep High School. They went on to successfully defend their Group 1 state championship crown by defeating Pennsville Memorial High School in the semifinals and Leonia High School in the finals, both by a score of 3−2.\n\nThe boys' tennis team won the Group I state championship in 1990 (vs. Haddonfield High School), 2010 (vs. Pitman High School), 2012 and 2013 (vs. Highland Park High School both years) and 2014 (vs. Pitman). The 1990 team won the program's first Group I state title, defeating Haddonfield High School. The team won the Group I state championship in 2010 with a 4–1 win over South Jersey champs Pitman High School. In 2012 the boys' team defeated reigning champs Highland Park by 3–2 in the Group I state championship. From there, the boys went on to win three consecutive Group I state championships (2012, 2013, 2014) beating Highland Park again 3–2 in 2013 and overcoming Pitman 3–2 in 2014. This dynasty became the first team in school history to win three consecutive Group I state championships. Between 2010 to 2014, the boys tennis team also won the most consecutive state sectional championships, five in a row, beating Jonathan Dayton High School each time.\n\nThe New Providence High School Marching Band has won USSBA New Jersey state championships in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016.

Species in the family may be referred to as capsid bugs or \"mirid bugs\". Common names include plant bugs, leaf bugs, and grass bugs. It is the largest family of true bugs belonging to the suborder Heteroptera; it includes over 10,000 known species, and new ones are being described constantly. Most widely known mirids are species that are notorious agricultural pests that pierce plant tissues, feed on the sap, and sometimes transmit viral plant diseases. Some species however, are predatory.\n\nMiridae are small, terrestrial insects, usually oval-shaped or elongate and measuring less than in length. Many of them have a hunched look, because of the shape of the prothorax, which carries the head bent down. Some are brightly coloured and attractively patterned, others drab or dark, most being inconspicuous. Some genera are ant mimics at certain stages of life. The Miridae do not have any ocelli. Their rostrum has four segments. One useful feature in identifying members of the family is the presence of a cuneus; it is the triangular tip of the corium, the firm, horny part of the forewing, the hemelytron. The cuneus is visible in nearly all Miridae, and only in a few other Hemiptera, notably the family Anthocoridae, which are not much like the Miridae in other ways. The tarsi almost always have three segments.\n\n\n\nThis family includes a large number of species, many of which are still unknown, distributed in more than 1300 genera. The taxonomic tree is divided into the following seven subfamilies and numerous tribes:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2331197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331197", "title": "Vint", "text": "Vint\n\nVint is a Russian card-game, similar to both bridge and whist and it is sometimes referred to as Russian whist. \"Vint\" means a screw in Russian, and the name is given to the game because the four players, each in turn, propose, bid and overbid each other until one, having bid higher than the others care to follow, makes the trump, and his vis-a-vis plays as his partner.\n\nThe game spread to Finland, where it evolved into Skruuvi, which features also a kitty and misère contracts.\n\nVint has many similarities to rubber bridge: The cards have the same rank. The score of tricks is entered under the line, and points for slam, honors, and penalties for undertricks above the line. The bidding is similar to bridge, one bids the number of tricks and the trump suit or no trump.\n\nDuring the progress of the bidding and declaring, opportunity is taken by the players to indicate by their calls their strength in the various suits and the high cards they hold, so that, when the playing begins, the position of the best cards and the strength of the different hands can often be fairly accurately estimated.\n\nUnlike Bridge, in Vint there is no dummy, all taken tricks count toward a game (that is, the tricks taken by the defenders as well as the tricks taken by the declarer side including overtricks, regardless of whether the contract was made or not), and the bidding ends after eight consecutive passes (everyone passes twice including the player who made the last bid.) The value of a trick depends on the level of the contract. In higher contracts the value of a trick is higher.\n\nThe card play follows the standard whist formula. One must follow suit, but if unable to do so, one can play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump, if there are trumps in the trick, otherwise by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of the trick starts the next one.\n\nPoints are awarded also for honours. In a no trump declaration aces count only as honors; in a suit declaration both the aces and the five next highest cards.\n\nThe game emerged during the latter half of the 19th century. In primitive forms, known as Siberian Vint, the value of the trick depended on the level of the contract and the trump suit. Later, this was simplified so that the level of the contract was the only thing the value of the trick depended on.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the kitty was added to the game. The highest bidder took a kitty of 4 cards to his hand and gave one card for every other player before the card play started. Towards the end of the 19th century, also the card exchange mechanism used in Skruuvi was born. The highest bidder took the kitty in his hand, gave 4 cards for his partner, who, in turn, gave one card for every other player. This enabled the declarer side to arrange themselves very shaped hands, which lead to higher contracts.\n\nThere are references to Vint in classical Russian literature, notably in the short stories of Anton Chekhov, and in \"Cancer Ward\" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.\n\nSkruuvi is a Finnish variant of Vint, and it became common in Finland while it was a part of Russia. The rules of Skruuvi diverged slowly from Vint, and the rules were codified in the 1940s in the books \"Skruuviopas\" by the pseudonym O.L. and \"Uusi täydellinen skruuvipelin ohjekirja\" by the pseudonym E.N. Maalari. Skruuvi is still played in Finland as a niche hobby whereas Vint is not played in Russia. Helsingin Suomalainen Klubi still organizes annual \"Toro Skruuvi\" tournament in honour of Arvo Ylppö, an enthusiastic Skruuvi player.\n\nSkruuvi uses a bidding system similar to bridge, but the emphasis of the bidding system is more in signifying individual high cards, similar to slam-investigating cue bids in bridge.\n\nIn Skruuvi, as described by E.N. Maalari, there is a kitty of four cards that the declarer side gets after bidding, and the game involves some exchange of cards so that everyone ends up with 13 cards. After the exchange of cards, the bidding continues, but only the members of the declarer side are allowed to participate in bidding. The trick-taking play occurs after this second bidding round.\n\nIn addition to the Vint-style scoring, the declarer side gets a bonus for a made contract that depends on the level of the contract. In Skruuvi, the non-declarer side may also double by knocking on the table before the card play starts.\n\nIt is also possible to bid \"misääri\", a contract where the aim is to avoid tricks. In a round-pass situation a forced \"misääri\" is played.\n\nSince the exchange of cards favours the declarer side, final contracts in Skruuvi are rather high, at a level of four or higher. In some circles undoubled contracts of four odd tricks, and sometimes also undoubled contracts of five odd tricks, are judged made without playing out the hand.\n\nAfter a rubber has been played in Skruuvi, four end games (called \"Kotka\") are played without a kitty. In the end games the bidding starts at a level of six (small slam level), and the exchange of cards favours highly the declarer side.\n\nA typical skruuvi night consists of three matches, where a match consists of a rubber of ordinary skruuvi and four \"kotkas\". Between the matches, the seats are changed so that everyone plays as a partner of everyone else. The partnerships may be temporarily broken if the players make certain special bids, \"bolshevik\" or \"mussolini\". In these contracts the declarer plays alone against everyone else, in \"bolshevik\" a grand slam \"misääri\", and in \"mussolini\" a grand slam no trump.\n\nThe scoring system of the classical Skruuvi, as played in the first half of the 20th century, was notoriously complicated, with scoring for games, made contracts, taken tricks (or avoided tricks in \"misääri\"), various honours, penalties for failed contracts, penalties for aces taken in tricks during a \"misääri\" contract and, of course, special scoring for \"bolshevik\" and \"mussolini\".\n\nSince the 1950s, at Helsingin Suomalainen Klubi, the scoring system has been streamlined. Bonuses for honors and the concept of playing a rubber have been dropped altogether. A match consists of four hands of ordinary skruuvi, four hands of \"kotkas\" and four hands of \"bolsheviks\". According to earlier rules, it was possible to bid a \"bolshevik\", but the club rules made it mandatory for everyone to bid \"bolshevik\" once during a twelve-hand match. Only slam contracts and doubled contracts are actually played out, and other contracts are judged made without actual card play.\n\nAnother modern variant consists of eight hands, four hands of ordinary skruuvi and four hands of kotkas. Points are awarded only for made contracts, avoided tricks in forced misääri, and penalties for undertricks and penalties for taken aces in \"misääri\". In this variant, all the hands are played out, but the minimum allowed final contract is five odd tricks.\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}

He is regarded as one of the most original artists working in Milan in the 1620s. He broke away from the exaggerated manner of Lombard Mannerism in favour of an early Baroque style, distinguished by clarity of form and content. A prolific history painter, he was also known for his portraits.\n\nHe was born in a family that was original from Busto Arsizio. It is not clear whether he himself was born in Busto Arsizio or in Milan. The date of his birth is not known with certainty with estimates ranging from 1591 to 1598. His training is not well documented and he is first recorded in 1619 as working with local painter Guglielmo Caccia working on an assignment in a church in Milan.\n\nOne of his first teachers was Giuseppe Vermiglio of Turin. He next studied with Giovanni Battista Crespi and Giulio Cesare Procaccini. In 1621, Crespi was involved with the Accademia Ambrosiana.\n\nCrespi died in Milan during the plague epidemic in 1630.\n\nAmong his pupils was Melchiorre Giraldini.\n\nCrespi was mainly active as painter of religious subjects used as decoration for churches. He was also known for his sensitive portraits.\nHe was an excellent colorist, known for the simplistic beauty of his compositions. His best works include a series of pictures from the life of Saint Bruno (now in the Certosa di Garegnano in Milan) and a depiction of the \"Stoning of St. Stephen\" (in Brera).\n\nAnother masterpiece is the dark 1628 in the church of Santa Maria della Passione in Milan, one of the best-known early 17th-century paintings in northern Italy. Other works by him can be found in Milan and Pavia.\n\n\"The Conversion of Saint Paul\", painted about 1623, is considered to be the artist's finest painting in the United States (at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin). When compared to Caravaggio's earlier work in the Cerasi Chapel, it shows the persistence of Crespi's Mannerist traits.\n"}

This sequential architecture was originally stated in terms of standard automata theory as a system of cooperating finite state automata, but more recently I have become interested in neuroscientific work which identifies chaotic attractor trajectory in state space as the fundamental principle of brain function at a level above that of the individual neuron, and which indicates that sensory processing, and perhaps higher cognition more generally, are implemented by cooperating attractor sequence processes.

It is based on two pre-existing corpora, one of them collected in the late 1960s by the Tyneside Linguistic Survey (TLS) project, and the other in 1994 by the Phonological Variation and Change in Contemporary Spoken English (PVC) project. NECTE amalgamates the TLS and PVC materials into a single Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)-conformant XML-encoded corpus and makes them available in a variety of aligned formats: digitized audio, standard orthographic transcription, phonetic transcription, and part-of-speech tagged. This website describes the NECTE corpus in detail, and makes it available to academic researchers, educationalists, the media in non-commercial applications, and organisations such as language societies and individuals with a serious interest in historical dialect materials.\n\nSince completion of the NECTE project he has been developing a methodology for sociolinguistic and dialectological study of the corpus, the aim of which is to attempt to identify interesting regularities in phonetic variation among informants in the corpus, and any correlations between such variation and associated social factors. The methodology is based on the one formulated by the originators of much of the NECTE corpus, the Tyneside Linguistic Survey (TLS). It was radical at the time and remains so today: in contrast to the then-universal and still-dominant theory driven approach, where social and linguistic factors are selected by the analyst on the basis of some combination of an independently specified theoretical framework, existing case studies, and personal experience of the domain of enquiry, the TLS proposed a fundamentally empirical approach in which salient factors are extracted from the data itself and then serve as the basis for model construction. To implement its approach the TLS used a particular exploratory multivariate analytical technique, hierarchical cluster analysis, but its work never progressed beyond preliminary studies for a variety of theoretical and practical reasons.

The station was reopened on 28 November 2008.\nBy 2022, the station will be open to go to the Big Ring Metro Line named Rubtsovskaya.\n\nNamed after the electric light bulb factory nearby, the preliminary layout included Schuko's idea of making the ceiling covered with six rows of circular incandescent inset lamps (of which there were 318 in total). However the outbreak of World War II halted all works until 1943 when construction resumed. Gelfreich and Rozhin finished the design by adding an addition theme to the station the struggle of the home front during the war, which is highlighted by the 12 marble bas-reliefs on the pylons done by Georgiy Motovilov. The rest of the station's interior features most of the 1930s plans including powder-ballada marble on the rectangular pylons (the outside faces have sconces and decorative gilded grilles depicting the hammer and sickle), red salietti marble on the station walls, a dark olive duvalu marble on the socle and a chessboard layout on the main platform floor of granite and labradorite.\n\nThe station's hexagonal shaped vestibule, features a domed structure on a low drum, on the corner niches of which are six medallions with bas-reliefs of main pioneers in electricity and electrical engineering: William Gilbert, Benjamin Franklin, Mikhail Lomonosov, Michael Faraday, Pavel Yablochkov, and Alexander Popov along with their pioneering apparatus. The interior of the vestibule is further punctuated by the same bright red salietti marble. Outside the vestibule in the archway there is a sculpture to the metro-builders by Matvey Manizer.\n\nThe station's legacy was that it serves as a bridge between the pre-war Art Deco-influenced Stalinist architecture as seen on the second stage stations and their post-war counterparts on the Koltsevaya Line. Both Gelfreich and Rozhin were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946 for their work.\n"}

Leach notes in the introduction to that book: \"Whatever you are doing, however you are coping, if you listen to your child and to your own feelings, there will be something you can actually do to put things right or make the best of those that are wrong.\"\n\nBorn in Hampstead, London, she is the daughter of the novelists Nigel Balchin and Elizabeth Ayrton. She graduated from Newnham College, Cambridge, with honours in 1959. After Cambridge, she attended the London School of Economics, where she received her PhD in psychology (1964) and lectured on child development. Her first research positions included a year in the Home Office Research Unit studying juvenile crime and six years at the Medical Research Council Developmental Research Unit. Leach is a fellow of the British Psychological Society (1988), was Vice-President of the Health Visitors' Association (1988–1999), and President of the National Childminding Association(1999–2006). She was a founding member of AIMH (The Association of Infant Mental Health) (1998–2002) and is now an adviser. She also worked for the Pre-school Parents' Association and with organisations concerned with children's rights, including the NSPCC (Trustee, 1996–1999) and its sister organisations in Ireland, the US, and Canada, and the Children's Rights Development Unit (1996–2001). As a founder and parent educator of EPOCH (End Physical Punishment of Children) (1988–2004), now CAU (Children are Unbeatable), she has written pamphlets and booklets campaigning against physical punishment and in favor of positive discipline. Since 2009 she has been a Director of the Mindful Policy group which seeks to link psychological research and political policy. Recently she has contributed to work on the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum, writing the lead chapter to the book \"Too Much Too Soon?: Early Learning and the erosion of childhood\", Hawthorne Press 2011. Between 1997 and 2005, Leach co-directed the largest ever English study of childcare.\n\nHer current research, writing and teaching focuses on contemporary infant neuroscience which in some areas is producing evidence where formerly there were only ideas and opinions. In 2013 she published a chapter entitled \"Infant Rearing in the Context of Contemporary Neuroscience\" in the \"Handbook of Child Wellbeing\", eds. Korbin and Asher, published by Springer. She is a senior research fellow of the Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck, University of London, and of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust (1997–). She is a visiting professor at the Faculty of Education, University of Winchester (2013–).\n\nLeach's most popular work is \"Your Baby and Child\", which appeared in extensively revised versions in 1988, `997, 2003 and 2010. The book is divided into five major sections, covering newborns, \"settled babies\", \"older babies\", \"toddlers\" and \"young children.\" Each section includes information on expected developmental milestones and patterns in the areas of sleep, eating, \"crying and comforting\", speech, and physical growth. The book's central thesis is to illuminate \"the successive tasks of development with which [children] are involved, the kinds of thought of which they are capable and the extremes of emotion that carry them along\" because \"the happier you can make your baby, the more you will enjoy being with her, and the more you enjoy her, the happier she will be\".\n\nThe popularity of \"Your Baby and Child\" led to a television series of the same name on Lifetime, which Leach wrote and hosted. The show won a CableACE Award and was nominated for an Emmy.\n\n\nLeach has also produced several home videos sponsored by Barnardo's (\"Becoming a Family\", \"Baby to Toddler\", and \"Toddler to Child\" 1987–1988) as well as collaborating on a play, \"Snap Happy\" that toured schools between 1986 and1991 to teach conflict resolution to preschool and school-aged children.\n\nLeach has been criticised for her view that young children require one-on-one attention, ideally provided by mothers or family members \nand which cannot be provided in day-care. Criticism has chiefly been directed towards Leach's purported idolising of mothers and difficulty giving fathers equal importance, and the lack of scientific evidence to support Leach's opposition to child care where the ratio of adults to infants is too low for individualised care.\n\nHowever, \"The Essential First Year\", published in 2010, has a chapter called \"Thinking about working outside your home\" which says \"Your baby will flourish without you while you are at work as long as he passes seamlessly from your loving care to someone elses and back again on your return...\"\n\nAfter the release of her book \"Family Breakdown\" Leach asserted that there was \"undisputed evidence\" that sleepovers with a divorced father, who is not the child's primary caregiver, can cause 'emotional damage' to a baby or toddler. Leach's claim has been broadly disputed by other psychologists.\n\nIn 1963 Leach married the science journalist Gerald A. Leach (1933–2004). Leach has a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Melissa Leach.\n\n"}

Saluang more simple than other kind of flute because it is made just adding 4 holes and finish. The dimension of saluang is 3–4 cm in diameter and 40–60 cm in length. It is related to the suling of other parts of Indonesia. \n\nSaluang player can play that music instrument without interrupting for taking breath from start to end of song. They have developed special breathing technique in blowing that instrument without pausing for breath.\n\nMinangkabau people believe that talang which is collected from rack of clothes dryer or found drifting in the river is a good material for making saluang. Traditionally Minangkabau people also use talang as a container for sticky rice food (lamang, lemang) and as horizontal rack for drying clothes (\"jemuran kain\") under sunlight .\n\nOne famous saluang player is Idris Sutan Sati with saluang female singer Syamsimar. Today, it is not so easy to find classic saluang cassette even in original place of saluang (Minangkabau).\n\nStyle of saluang tune for example : Singgalang, Pariaman, Koto Tuo, Ratok Solok, Cupak, Salayo and Pauah.

It was the first such program, running from December 1933 to June 1934. It was headed by Edward Bruce, under the United States Treasury Department and paid for by the Civil Works Administration.\n\nThe purpose of the PWAP was \"to give work to artists by arranging to have competent representatives of the profession embellish public buildings.\" Artists were told that the subject matter had to be related to the \"American scene\". Artworks from the project were shown or incorporated into a variety of locations, including the White House and House of Representatives.\n\nArtists participating in the project were paid wages of $38 – $46.50 per week. Participants were required to be professional artists, and in total, 3,749 artists were hired, and 15,663 works were produced.\n\nThe project was succeeded by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA).\n\nThe largest of the projects sponsored by the PWAP were the murals in San Francisco’s Coit Tower, employing a total of 44 artists and assistants, begun in December 1933 and completed in June 1934. Many of the muralists were faculty members or former students of the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA). Among the lead artists were Maxine Albro, Victor Arnautoff, Jane Berlandina, Ray Bertrand, Roy Boynton, Ralph Chesse, Ben Cunningham, Rinaldo Cuneo, Mallette Harold Dean, Parker Hall, Edith Hamlin, George Albert Harris, William Hesthal, John Langley Howard, Lucien Labaudt, Gordon Langdon, Jose Moya del Pino, Otis Oldfield, Frederick E. Olmsted, Suzanne Scheuer, Ralph Stackpole, Edward Terada, Frede Vidar, Clifford Wight, and Bernard Zakheim. \n\nAfter a majority of the murals were completed, the Big Strike of 1934 shut down the Pacific Coast. Though it has been claimed that allusions to the event were subversively included in the murals by some of the artists, in fact the murals were largely completed before the strike began and none of those that were not completed by that time show any reference to the strike.\n\nAnother significant project funded by PWAP is the \"Astronomers Monument\" at Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The monument is a large outdoor concrete sculpture on the front lawn of the Observatory that pays homage to six of the greatest astronomers of all time: Hipparchus (about 150 BC); Nicholas Copernicus (1473–1543); Galileo Galilei (1564–1642); Johannes Kepler (1571–1630); Isaac Newton (1642–1727); and William Herschel (1738–1822). Soon after the PWAP began in December 1933, in cooperation with the Los Angeles Park Commission, PWAP commissioned a sculpture project on the grounds of the new Griffith Observatory (which was under construction). Using a design by local artist Archibald Garner and materials donated by the Women's' Auxiliary of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Garner and five other artists sculpted and cast the concrete monument and figures. Each artist was responsible for sculpting one astronomer; one of the artists, George Stanley, was also the creator of the famous \"Oscar\" statuette presented at the Academy Awards. On November 25, 1934, about six months prior to the opening of the Observatory, a celebration took place to mark completion of the \"Astronomers Monument\". The only \"signature\" on the \"Astronomers Monument\" is \"PWAP 1934\" referring to the program which funded the project and the year it was completed.\n\nThis Art Deco style monument serves as the gateway to the Hollywood Bowl, and is said to be the largest of hundreds of monuments in Southern California constructed under the WPA. The 200-foot long, 22-foot high sculpture is also a fountain and was constructed with concrete and covered with slabs of decorative granite.\n\nThe structure was completed in 1940 by George Stanley, also a contributor to the Griffith Observatory's Astronomers Monument and who is better known as the sculptor who molded the original Academy Awards' Oscar statue. The structure was refurbished in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also a cartographer, a photographer and a professor of mechanical engineering.\n\nJoseph Nisbet LeConte was born in Oakland, California to Joseph and Caroline (Nisbet) LeConte. He went by \"Little Joe\" among friends, because he was of short stature and the son of geology professor Joseph LeConte.\nHe often went by J. N. LeConte in photographs and articles. He entered the University of California, Berkeley in 1887, earning a B.S. degree in 1891. He received a Master of Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University in 1892, and was appointed assistant professor of mechanical engineering at U.C. Berkeley that August, beginning by teaching kinematics of machinery.\n\nStarting in 1912, he taught analytical mechanics for over 20 years. German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen discovered x-rays in 1895, and his first research paper was published at the end of December. An Austrian newspaper reported the results a week later. After reading those reports, LeConte found cathode ray tubes that his late uncle John LeConte had obtained for the university's physics lab. LeConte and his associates were able to construct an x-ray machine and produce images of a bullet lodged in the arm of a young boy within a week of the newspaper reports of Röntgen's discovery. LeConte also studied the materials problems of gas turbines, and built a harmonic analyzer to study the performance of electric power transmission lines. He was a professor at U.C. Berkeley for his entire career that lasted 45 years.\n\nLeConte loved mountaineering from the time he was a teenager and went all over the Sierra Nevada exploring, sometimes for several weeks. He produced the first map of the central Sierra Nevada for the Sierra Club, based on his exploration. At that time, USGS maps were not available. Along with James S. Hutchinson and Duncan McDuffie, he pioneered a high mountain route in 1908 from Yosemite National Park to Kings Canyon, roughly along the route of the modern John Muir Trail. In 28 days, they completed a trip of 228 miles through the high mountains, including several previously unexplored sections.\n\nAn avid photographer, he took many photos of the Sierra Nevada, including the High Sierra and Hetch Hetchy Valley before it was flooded by the dam. He worked with heavy, fragile dry glass plates that had to be transported with great care throughout the wilderness. In 1944, Ansel Adams evaluated his work: \"Never intentionally 'arty', most of his compositions reveal a sensitive reaction to the finest moments of the mountain scene. It is this quality that differentiates between a mere \"record\" and a \"creative, sympathetic statement\".\" \n\nA charter and lifelong member of the Sierra Club, he held positions of leadership in it. After John Muir died, he served as the club's second president (1915-1917). He was instrumental in helping create the John Muir Trail through the High Sierra as a tribute to his predecessor.\nHe sat on the Sierra Club Board of Directors from 1898 through 1940, and at various times was VP, secretary, treasurer, and outings chair.\n\nIn 1901 he married Helen Gompertz, whom he met in the Sierra Club.\n\nLeConte Point in Hetch Hetchy Valley is named after him.\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 21st round of the 1997 MLB draft.\n\nRomero was traded by the Twins to the Angels on December 9, 2005, for infielder Alexi Casilla.\n\nRomero was one of the Puerto Rican players to agree to play for Puerto Rico in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.\n\nOn October 6, 2006, the Angels declined his contract option for 2007, making him a free agent. On December 15, he signed a 1-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. However, on June 9, 2007, he was designated for assignment, and then released on June 19, 2007.\n\nOn June 23, 2007, Romero signed with the Philadelphia Phillies. During that season, Romero's ERA fell to just over 1.00. Romero improved a weak Phillies' bullpen plagued by inconsistency and injuries, which posted a 3.17 ERA in the final stretch of September. He also played a crucial role in the Phillies' triumph on the last day of the season, when in a 6–1 victory over the Nationals that capped the team's comeback against the New York Mets, Romero pitched one inning and struck out two. Romero was named the Phillies' top reliever for the post-season. On November 10, 2007, Romero agreed to a multi-year deal to remain with the Phillies.\n\nOn October 29, 2008, Romero was the winning pitcher in Game 5 of the World Series, which clinched the first major championship in the city of Philadelphia in 25 years. Along with his win in Game 3, he became the first Puerto Rican pitcher to win two games in one World Series.\n\nHis club option for 2011 was declined by the Phillies after the 2010 season, but he agreed to return to the team by signing a one-year contract.

Romero actually tested positive on August 26, 2008, but he took the case to arbitration, allowing him to pitch in the postseason and World Series; after he stopped taking the supplement, he tested negative before the playoffs. Due to the suspension, Romero lost $1.25 million, so he is suing the makers of the supplement, Ergopharm Inc., along with The Vitamin Shoppe and GNC for his lost salary and punitive damages.

Graduating from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, where Efron studied under journalist John Chamberlain, her career began as a writer for the \"New York Times Magazine\". In 1947, she married a Haitian businessman, with whom she had a child. After living in Haiti and working as a Central America correspondent for \"Time\" and \"Life\" magazines, she divorced and returned to New York City where she worked on the staff of television journalist Mike Wallace. After her return to New York, she also became part of Ayn Rand's circle, contributed to Rand's magazine, \"The Objectivist\", and presented a lecture series on non-fiction writing at the Nathaniel Branden Institute in the 1960s, although the two women later parted ways.\n\nShe became a writer and, later, a senior editor of the widely circulated \"TV Guide\" magazine in the 1960s and 1970s, where she wrote celebrity profiles, political columns and editorials. In the 1970s, she was also ghostwriter for former Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon's book \"A Time For Truth\". In her editorials for \"TV Guide\", Efron criticized what she saw as liberal media bias, and she defended conservative politicians Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. Efron and other columnists writing in \"TV Guide\" like Kevin Phillips and Pat Buchanan advocated the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine by the Federal Communications Commission, in order to permit conservative viewpoints greater access to the airwaves. The FCC would remove the policy in the late 1980s.\n\nIn their 1993 history of \"TV Guide\", \"Changing Channels: America in TV Guide\", Cornell professors Glenn C. Altschuler and David I. Grossvogel have stated that \"no writer...did more to shape \"TV Guide\",\" a publication that reached over 40 million readers at the time. Her impact on the magazine, they said, included her role as \"the quintessential \"TV Guide\" voice on race relations.\" All the positions she took on race in her articles, Efron is quoted as saying, \"were determined by what I thought would be good for a young, vulnerable black child,\" a reflection of the issues which Efron herself had faced while bringing up a biracial son in the segregated America of the 1950s.\n\nIn 1971, Efron published \"The News Twisters\", a controversial book which claimed to find media bias in the television news coverage of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, one of the first studies of its kind ever conducted. This was followed by her 1972 work, \"How CBS Tried to Kill a Book\", an examination of CBS News's reaction to her study.\n\nShe was a contributing editor to \"Reason\" magazine from the 1970s until her death in 2001, where she wrote psychological studies of former President Bill Clinton and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The latter prompted Justice Thomas to declare that Efron had been the \"only person\" to understand what was going through his mind during the hearings that made him a household name, according to \"Reason\" editor Virginia Postrel.\n\nIn 1984, Efron published \"The Apocalyptics\", described as \"an exposé of shoddy science and its effects on environmental policy,\" which systematically examined the regulatory \"science\" behind the banning of chemicals in consumer products, debunking the alleged \"cancer epidemic\" claimed to exist by many in the media.\n\n"}
{"id": "2331297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331297", "title": "Critical radius", "text": "Critical radius\n\nCritical radius is the minimum particle size from which an aggregate is thermodynamically stable. In other words, it is the lowest radius formed by atoms or molecules clustering together (in a gas, liquid or solid matrix) before a new phaseinclusion (a bubble, a droplet or a solid particle) is viable and begins to grow. Formation of such stable nuclei is called nucleation.\n\nAt the beginning of the nucleation process, the system finds itself in an initial phase. Afterwards, the formation of aggregates or clusters from the new phase occurs gradually and randomly at the nanoscale. Subsequently, if the process is feasible, the nucleus is formed. Notice that the formation of aggregates is conceivable under specific conditions. When these conditions are not satisfied, a rapid creation-annihilation of aggregates takes place and the nucleation and posterior crystal growth process does not happen.\n\nIn precipitation models, nucleation is generally a prelude to models of the crystal growth process. Sometimes precipitation is rate-limited by the nucleation process. An example would be when someone takes a cup of superheated water from a microwave and, when jiggling it with a spoon or against the wall of the cup, heterogeneous nucleation occurs and most of water particles convert into steam.\n\nIf the change in phase forms a crystalline solid in a liquid matrix, the atoms might then form a dendrite. The crystal growth continues in three dimensions, the atoms attaching themselves in certain preferred directions, usually along the axes of a crystal, forming a characteristic tree-like structure of a dendrite.\n\nThe critical radius of a system can be determined from its Gibbs free energy.\n\nformula_1\n\nIt has two components, the volume energy formula_2 and the surface energy formula_3. The first one describes how probable it is to have a phase change and the second one is the amount of energy needed to create an interface. \n\nThe mathematical expression of formula_2 , considering spherical particles, is given by:\n\nformula_5\n\nwhere formula_6 is the Gibbs free energy per volume and obeys formula_7. It is defined as the energy difference between one system at a certain temperature and the same system at the fusion temperature and it depends on pressure, the number of particles and temperature: formula_8. For a low temperature, far from the fusion point, this energy is big (it is more difficult to change the phase) and for a temperature close to the fusion point it is small (the system will tend to change its phase). \n\nRegarding formula_3 and considering spherical particles, its mathematical expression is given by:\n\nformula_10 \n\nwhere formula_11 is the surface tension we need to break to create a nucleus. The value of the formula_12 is never negative as it always takes energy to create an interface. \n\nThe total Gibbs free energy is therefore:\n\nformula_13\n\nThe critical radius formula_14 is found by optimization, setting the derivative of formula_15 equal to zero.\n\nformula_16\n\nyielding\n\nformula_17,\n\nwhere formula_11 is the surface tension and formula_19 is the absolute value of the Gibbs free energy per volume. \n\nThe Gibbs free energy of nuclear formation is found replacing the critical radius expression in the general formula.\n\nformula_20\n\nWhen the Gibbs free energy change is positive, the nucleation process will not be prosperous. The nanoparticle radius is small, the superficial term prevails the volum term formula_21. Contrary, if the variation rate is negative, it will be thermodynamically stable. The size of the cluster surpasses the critical radius. In this occasion, the volum term overcomes the superficial term formula_22.\n\nFrom the expression of the critical radius, as the Gibbs volume energy increases, the critical radius will decrease and hence, it will be easier achieving the formation of nuclei and begin the cristallization process.\n\nIn order to decrease the value of the critical radius formula_23 and promote nucleation, a supercooling or superheating process may be used.\n\nSupercooling is a phenomenon in which the system's temperature is lowered under the phase transition temperature without the creation of the new phase. Let formula_24 be the temperature difference, where formula_25 is the phase transition temperature. Let formula_26 be the volume Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy respectively. \n\nWhen formula_27, the system has null Gibbs free energy, so:\n\nformula_28 \n\nIn general, the following approximations can be done: \n\nformula_29 and formula_30\n\nConsequently:\n\nformula_31 \n\nSo: \n\nformula_32\n\nSubtituting this result on the expressions for formula_23 and formula_34, the following equations are obtained:\n\nformula_35 \n\nformula_36\n\nNotice that formula_23 and formula_34 diminish with an increasing supercooling. Analogously, a mathematical derivation for the superheating can be done. \n\n"}

With 597 seats, it is the smallest theatre on Broadway. It was an ABC Television studio from 1957 to 1963. Later the syndicated talk show \"The Merv Griffin Show\", before it moved to Los Angeles in 1972, was taped at the theatre.\n\nThe Little Theatre was designed by the architect Harry Creighton Ingalls of the firm Ingalls & Hoffman, and built by Winthrop Ames; its name was chosen due to both the theatre's small size (with a seating capacity of only 300), and its goal to create intimate productions.\n\nThe theatre opened on March 12, 1912, with John Galsworthy's play \"The Pigeon\". Other plays opening that year included:\n\n\nIn the 1920s, Herbert J. Krapp redesigned the theatre to increase its seating capacity to 590 and to improve its acoustics. The building was sold to \"The New York Times\" in 1931, and converted into a conference hall named 'New York Times Hall'.\n\nWestinghouse Broadcasting used the theatre for the Merv Griffin Show during the 1960s.\nIn 1979, Martin Markinson and Donald Tick bought the theatre from Westinghouse for $800,000.\n\nThe theatre was named for Helen Hayes in 1983 when the actress's existing namesake theatre on West 46th Street was demolished, along with the Morosco Theatre and the Bijou Theatre, to construct the New York Marriott Marquis. According to \"Playbill\", \"The tribute was deemed fitting by the theatrical community, since the first theatre bearing the name of Helen Hayes, on West Forty-sixth Street, had been torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.\"\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced that Markinson and the Tick family planned to sell the theatre to the Second Stage Theater company for an undisclosed price. It was announced on April 18, 2015, that the sale of Helen Hayes Theater to Second Stage had been completed. The sale price was $24.7 million. The first Second Stage production at the Hayes Theater was Lobby Hero, by Kenneth Lonergan, starring Michael Cera and Chris Evans, which opened in the spring of 2018, after renovations and upgrades. Second Stage became one of only four nonprofit theater companies that own and operate theaters on Broadway.\n\n\"Rock of Ages\" achieved the box office record for the Helen Hayes Theatre. The production grossed $745,205 over nine performances, for the week ending December 31, 2012.\n\nCBS used the theatre as a radio studio for a time, but it was converted to television by ABC in 1957 and renamed the Little Theatre. Dick Clark's Saturday night \"The Dick Clark Show\" originated there from February 1958 through September 1960. During this time, ABC also broadcast the daytime show \"Who Do You Trust?\" with Johnny Carson from the theatre. It was briefly renamed the Winthrop Ames Theatre in 1964. From 1965 through 1983, it was again the Little Theatre. During the early part of that period, Westinghouse Broadcasting taped the syndicated \"Merv Griffin Show\" there and later, \"The David Frost Show\". The 1969–70 season of the game show \"Beat the Clock\" hosted by Jack Narz was also taped there.\n\nColin Quinn's one-man show \"Long Story Short\" was recorded there as an HBO special; it had opened at the theatre in November 2010.\n\n"}

He moved with his mother and brothers to a cold-water flat in Elizabeth, New Jersey, when he was 10; he quit high school at age 16, when, although he was under age, he enlisted in the Army, where he became a military policeman. Back home, he earned a high school diploma in night school and later studied design and engineering in the evenings at West Coast University. He worked for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, then moved to California in 1955 and worked as an aerospace engineer. He has two sons, Chris Holden, a California State Assemblymember, and Reginald Holden, a Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff.\n\nHolden was an amateur boxer as a teenager, weighing only 167 pounds. At age 59, he was a \"tall, gray-haired dignified-looking man in a nicely conservative suit.\" Holden completed the Los Angeles Marathon in 1990 and 1991, when he was in his sixties.\n\nHe had two sides to his personality, \"Los Angeles Times\" reporter Bill Boyarsky wrote in 1989 — \"The Nice Nate\" and \"The Mean Nate.\" On one hand, Holden was \"a gentle, considerate, compassionate person much of the time.\" On the other hand, Boyarsky wrote, Holden is marked by a \"hostile toughness . . . when he discusses the way black leaders refused to back him in unsuccessful races and in his election to the council.\" Fellow councilman John Ferraro said of Holden, \"He is gruff and he is rough, but he has a big heart.\"\n\nIn California, he became active in Democratic politics; he was a member of the \"steering committee for the California Democratic Council's peace delegation\" and an officer of the Alta Loma Democratic Club. Holden made his first run for public office in 1968, when he was an unsuccessful candidate in California's 26th congressional district, which at the time included Beverly Hills, part of Culver City, most of Venice and some of Santa Monica and West Los Angeles. He became president of the CDC in 1970 and that year made two more runs for Congress.\n\nHolden began his service as a state senator in 1974, but gave up his office after four years to campaign unsuccessfully for the Congressional seat ultimately won by Julian C. Dixon.\n\n1987: Holden took a leave from his job as assistant chief deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn to run against Homer Broome Jr. for the 10th District seat that had been vacated by the resignation of Dave Cunningham. Holden won by a 2–1 margin, even though Broome had been endorsed by Mayor Tom Bradley. Another candidate was Esther M. Lofton, who received fewer than 100 votes.\n\n1989: Holden took on Mayor Bradley directly when he entered the race for mayor. He angered some of his constituents during the campaign when he supported the proposed breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District. It was noted just before the election that Bradley's campaign fund vastly surpassed Holden's — $1,085,861 to $67,252. Bradley received 52 percent of vote to win in the April primary.\n\n1991: Lofton, 60, a former schoolteacher \"with no political base,\" challenged Holden again, stating she would not accept campaign contributions. When the votes were counted, Lofton had won an \"astounding 28%,\" the \"Los Angeles Times\" remarked editorially, ascribing the large percentage to Holden's \"hands-off policy regarding Police Chief Daryl Gates.\n\n1995: Holden was challenged in the April primary by Deputy District Attorney Kevin A. Ross and by Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School graduate J. Stanley (Stan) Sanders. In the final election against Sanders in June, Holden received 54% of the vote and was elected.\n\n1987: Forbidding the sale or manufacture of realistic toy guns. Bill passed.\n\n1990: Requiring buyers of Rolex watches to register the serial number with police, to make it difficult for crooks to sell them. Introduced in the wake of a rash of Rolex thefts of about one a day, with some owners killed.\n\n1999: Requiring cable companies to remove sneakers tied together and left dangling from overhead lines. Holden said they were \"menacing signals of gang territory and drug sales.\" Police officials said they were just pranks. Bill passed.\n\nThe Nate Holden Performing Arts Center at 4718 West Washington Boulevard is named in his honor.

In 1866 he became a pupil of the sculptor John Henry Foley. After Foley's death in 1874, Brock finished some of his commissions. It was his completion of Foley's statue of Prince Albert for the Albert Memorial which first brought Brock to prominence.\nHis group \"The Moment of Peril\" (now in the garden of Leighton House) was followed by \"The Genius of Poetry\", at the Carlsberg Brewery in Copenhagen, \"Eve\" (1898), and other imaginative works that mark his development. His portrait works include busts, such as those of Lord Leighton and Queen Victoria, statues, such as Sir Richard Owen and Henry Philpott, bishop of Worcester, and sepulchral monuments such as Lord Leighton (d.1896) in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nIn 1901 Brock was asked to make a colossal equestrian statue of \"Edward the Black Prince\" for Leeds City Square, and was also given perhaps his most significant commission, the vast multi-figure Imperial Memorial to Queen Victoria to be set up in front of Buckingham Palace. He had previously made statues of the queen to celebrate her golden and diamond jubilees, and designed the depiction of her \"veiled\" or \"widowed\" head, used on all gold, silver and bronze coinage between 1893 and 1901.

In the narrow or strict sense, however, the term refers only to four-kanji compounds that have a particular (idiomatic) meaning that cannot be inferred from the meanings of the components that make them up.\n\nThere exists a very large number — perhaps tens of thousands — of four-character compounds. A great majority of them are those whose meanings can be easily deduced from the literal definition of their parts. These compounds may be called \"non-idiomatic yojijukugo\".\n\nFor example, the compound word 屋内禁煙 \"okunaikin'en\" \"no smoking indoors\" is a non-idiomatic \"yojijukugo\". It is made up of four characters: 屋 \"oku\" building, 内 \"nai\" inside, 禁 \"kin\" prohibited, and 煙 \"en\" smoking. Alternatively, it can be regarded as consisting of two common two-character compounds: 屋内 \"okunai\" indoors, and 禁煙 \"kin'en\" prohibition of smoking. Either way, the meaning of the compound is clear; there are no idiomatic meanings beyond the literal meanings of its components. Below are a few more examples of non-idiomatic \"yojijukugo\":\n\n\nNote that 四字熟語 is itself a non-idiomatic four-character phrase.\n\nBy contrast, several thousands of these four-character compounds are true idioms in the sense that they have a particular meaning that may not be deduced from the literal meanings of the component words. An example of the highly idiomatic compound is:\n\n\n\"Ocean-thousand, mountain-thousand\" means \"a sly old fox\" or someone who has had all sorts of experience in life so that they can handle, or wiggle out of, any difficult situations through cunning alone. This meaning derives from an old saying that a snake lives in the ocean for a thousand years and in the mountains for another thousand years before it turns into a dragon. Hence a sly, worldly-wise person is referred to as one who has spent \"a thousand years in the ocean and another thousand in the mountain\".\n\nMany idiomatic \"yojijukugo\" were adopted from classical Chinese literature. Other four-character idioms are derived from Buddhist literature and scriptures, old Japanese customs and proverbs, and historical and contemporary Japanese life and social experience. The entries in the published dictionaries of \"yojijukugo\" are typically limited to these \"idiomatic\" compounds of various origins.\n\nThe Japanese \"yojijukugo\" are closely related to the Chinese \"chengyu\" in that a great many of the former are adopted from the latter and have the same or similar meaning as in Chinese. Many other \"yojijukugo\", however, are Japanese in origin. Some examples of these indigenous Japanese four-character idioms are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Typically a sugar solution or syrup is made and heated until it browns and becomes thick, producing a caramelized candy syrup. This hot candy is then mixed with popped popcorn, and allowed to cool. Sometimes, a candy thermometer is used, as making caramel is time-consuming and requires skill to make well without burning the sugar. The process creates a sweet flavored, crunchy snack food or treat. Some varieties, after coating with the candy syrup, are baked in an oven to crisp the mixture. Mixes of caramel corn sometimes contain nuts, such as peanuts, pecans, almonds, or cashews.\n\nThe combination of caramel and corn dates back at least as far as the 1890s with the strong molasses flavor of Cracker Jack, an early version of which was introduced at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The lighter, sweet but un-caramelized kettle corn, may be a North American Colonial predecessor to caramel corn.\n\nThere are many commercial brands and forms of caramel corn available, such as Cracker Jack, Fiddle Faddle, Lolly Gobble Bliss Bombs, and Crunch 'n Munch. In grocery stores, at cinemas, and convenience stores, pre-bagged caramel corn made locally may also be sold. The Maryland-based Fisher's Popcorn, Ohio-based Chesapeake Popcorn and Chicago-based Nuts on Clark are examples of specialty caramel corn and popcorn companies.\n\nCandy-coated popcorn is defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.\n\n"}
{"id": "2331324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331324", "title": "4th Panzer Army", "text": "4th Panzer Army\n\nThe 4th Panzer Army () (operating as Panzer Group 4 () from its formation on 15 February 1941 to 1 January 1942, when it was redesignated as a full army) was a German panzer formation during World War II. As a key armoured component of the Wehrmacht, the army took part in the crucial battles of the German-Soviet war of 1941–45, including Operation Barbarossa, the Battle of Moscow, the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk, and the 1943 Battle of Kiev.\n\nAs part of the German High Command's preparations for Operation Barbarossa, Generaloberst Erich Hoepner was appointed to command the 4th Panzer Group in February 1941. It was to drive toward Leningrad as part of Army Group North under Wilhelm von Leeb. On 30 March 1941, Hitler delivered a speech to about two hundred senior Wehrmacht officers where he laid out his plans for an ideological war of annihilation (\"Vernichtungskrieg\") against the Soviet Union. He stated that he \"wanted to see the impending war against the Soviet Union conducted not according to the military principles, but as a war of extermination\" against an ideological enemy, whether military or civilian. Many Wehrmacht leaders, including Hoepner, echoed the sentiment. As a commander of the 4th Panzer Group, he issued a directive to his troops:\n\nThe order was transmitted to the troops on Hoepner's initiative, ahead of the official OKW (Wehrmacht High Command) directives that laid the groundwork for the war of extermination, such as the Barbarossa Decree of 13 May 1941 and other orders. Hoepner's directive predated the first OKH (Army High Command) draft of the Commissar Order. The historian Jürgen Förster wrote that Hoepner's directive represented an \"independent transformation of Hitler's ideological intentions into an order\".\n\nThe 4th Panzer Group consisted of the LVI Panzer Corps (Erich von Manstein) and the XLI Panzer Corps (Georg-Hans Reinhardt). Their composition was as follows:\n\nThe Army Group was to advance through the Baltic States to Leningrad. Barbarossa commenced on 22 June 1941 with a massive German attack along the whole front line. The 4th Panzer Group headed for the Dvina River to secure the bridges near the town of Daugavpils. The Red Army mounted a number of counterattacks against the XLI Panzer Corps, leading to the Battle of Raseiniai.\n\nAfter Reinhardt's corps closed in, the two corps were ordered to encircle the Soviet formations around Luga. Again having penetrated deep into the Soviet lines with unprotected flanks, Manstein's corps was the target of a Soviet counteroffensive from 15 July at Soltsy by the Soviet 11th Army. Manstein's forces were badly mauled and the Red Army halted the German advance at Luga. Ultimately, the army group defeated the defending Soviet Northwestern Front, inflicting over 90,000 casualties and destroying more than 1,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, then advanced northeast of the Stalin line.\n\nOn 6 July 1941, Hoepner issued an order to his troops instructing them to treat the \"loyal population\" fairly, adding that \"individual acts of sabotage should simply be charged to communists and Jews\". As with all German armies on the Eastern Front, Hoepner's panzer group implemented the Commissar Order that directed Wehrmacht troops to murder Red Army political officers immediately upon capture, contravening the accepted laws of war. Between 2 July and 8 July, the 4th Panzer Group shot 101 Red Army political commissars, with the bulk of the executions coming from the XLI Panzer Corps. By 19 July, 172 executions of commissars had been reported.\n\nBy mid-July, the 4th Panzer Group seized the Luga bridgehead and had plans to advance on Leningrad. The staff and detachments 2 and 3 of \"Einsatzgruppe A\", one of the mobile killing squads following the Wehrmacht into the occupied Soviet Union, were brought up to the Luga district with assistance from the army. \"The movement of \"Einsatzgruppe A\"—which the army intended to use in Leningrad—was effected in agreement with Panzer Group 4 and at their express wish\", noted Franz Walter Stahlecker, the commander of \"Einsatzgruppe A\". Stahlecker described army co-operation as \"generally very good\" and \"in certain cases, as for example, with Panzer Group 4 under the command of General Hoepner, extremely close, one might say even warm\".\n\nBy late July, Army Group North positioned 4th Panzer Group's units south and east of Narva, Estonia, where they could begin an advance on Leningrad in terrain conditions relatively suitable for armoured warfare. By that time, however, the army group lacked the strength to take Leningrad, which continued to be a high priority for the German high command. A compromise solution was worked out whereas the infantry would attack north from both sides of Lake Ilmen, while the panzer group would advance from its current position. Hoepner's forces began their advance on August 8, but the attack ran into determined Soviet defences. Elsewhere, Soviet counter-attacks threatened Leeb's southern flank. By mid to late August, the German forces were making gains again, with the 4th Panzer Group taking Narva on 17 August. \n\nOn 29 August, Leeb issued orders for the blockade of Leningrad in anticipation that the city would soon be abandoned by the Soviets. On September 5, Hitler ordered Hoepner's 4th Panzer Group and an air corps transferred to Army Group Centre effective 15 September, in preparation for Operation Typhoon, the German assault on Moscow. Leeb objected and was given a reprieve in the transfer of his mobile forces, with the view of making one last push towards Leningrad. The 4th Panzer Group was to be the main attacking force, which reached south of the Neva River, where it was faced with strong Soviet counter-attacks. By 24 September, Army Group North halted its advance and transferred the 4th Panzer Group to Army Group Centre.\n\nAs part of Operation Typhoon, the 4th Panzer Group was subordinated to the 4th Army under the command of Günther von Kluge. In early October, the 4th Panzer Group completed the encirclement at Vyazma. Kluge instructed Hoepner to pause the advance, much to the latter's displeasure, as his units were needed to prevent break-outs of Soviet forces. Hoepner was confident that the clearing of the pocket and the advance on Moscow could be undertaken at the same time and viewed Kluge's actions as interference, leading to friction and \"clashes\" with his superior, as he wrote in a letter home on 6 October. Hoepner did not seem to appreciate that his units were very short on fuel; the 11th Panzer Division, reported having no fuel at all. Only the 20th Panzer Division was advancing towards Moscow amid deteriorating road conditions.\n\nOnce the Vyazma pocket was eliminated, other units were able to advance on 14 October. Heavy rains and onset of the \"rasputitsa\" (roadlessness) caused frequent damage to tracked vehicles and motor transport further hampering the advance. By early November, the 4th Panzer Group was depleted from earlier fighting and the weather but Hoepner, along with other panzer group commanders and Fedor von Bock, commander of Army Group Center, was impatient to resume the offensive.\n\nOn 17 November, the 4th Panzer Group attacked again towards Moscow alongside the V Army Corps of the 4th Army, as part of the continuation of Operation Typhoon by Army Group Centre. The panzer group and the army corps represented Kluge’s best forces, most ready for a continued offensive. In two weeks' fighting, Hoepner's forces advanced ( per day). Lacking strength and mobility to conduct battles of encirclement, the Group undertook frontal assaults which proved increasingly costly. A lack of tanks, insufficient motor transport and a precarious supply situation, along with tenacious Red Army resistance and the air superiority achieved by Soviet fighters hampered the attack.\n\nThe 3rd Panzer Group further north saw slightly better progress, averaging a day. The attack by the 2nd Panzer Group on Tula and Kashira, south of Moscow, achieved only fleeting and precarious success, while Guderian vacillated between despair and optimism, depending on the situation at the front. Facing pressure from the German High Command, Kluge finally committed his weaker south flank to the attack on 1 December. In the aftermath of the battle, Hoepner and Guderian blamed slow commitment of the south flank of the 4th Army to the attack for the German failure to reach Moscow, grossly overestimating the capabilities of Kluge’s remaining forces. It also failed to appreciate the reality that Moscow was a fortified position which the Wehrmacht lacked the strength to either encircle nor take in a frontal assault.\n\nAs late as 2 December, Hoepner urged his troops forward stating that \"the goal [the encirclement of Moscow] can still be achieved\". The next day, he warned Kluge that failure to break off the attack would \"bleed white\" his formations and make them incapable of defence. Kluge was sympathetic since the south flank of the 4th Army had already had to retreat under Red Army pressure and was on the defensive. Hoepner was ordered to pause his attack, with the goal of resuming it on 6 December. On 5 December 1941, with orders to attack the next day, Hoepner called a conference of chiefs-of-staff of his corps. The reports were grim: only four divisions were deemed capable of attack, three of these with limited objectives. The attack was called off; the Red Army launched its winter counter-offensive on the same day.\n\nOn 1 January 1942, the 4th Panzer Group was redesignated 4th Panzer Army. The 4th Panzer Army held defensive positions in the spring of 1942 and then was reinforced, re-fit and transferred to Army Group South for Case Blue, its offensive in Southern Russia. Command was transferred to general Hermann Hoth in june. As the operation progressed, Hitler divided Army Group South into two army groups. Army Group A which was composed of the German 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army and Army Group B which was composed of 6th Army and the 4th Panzer Army. The 4th Panzer Army was on 1 Aug 1942 composed of:\n\nArmy Group B's objective was to anchor itself on the Volga while Army Group A drove into the oil fields of the Caucasus. The 4th Panzer Army approached Stalingrad from the north while the 6th Army approached it from the west. Their aim was to meet up at Stalingrad and encircle the Soviet 62nd and 64th armies outside the city. The 6th Army was faced by a strong counterattack by the Soviet forces and failed to meet up with the 4th Panzer Army for three crucial days, allowing the two Soviet armies to withdraw into Stalingrad.\n\nThe 4th Panzer Army guarded the outside perimeter of Stalingrad while the 6th Army was engaged in the battle to capture the city. For over two months, the 6th Army was embroiled in vicious fighting in the city; though it was able to take over 90% of the city, it was unable to destroy the last pockets of resistance. On 19 November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a counter-offensive which encircled of the entire 6th Army and the 24th Panzer Division of the 4th Panzer Army. The 4th Panzer Army tried and failed to break the encirclement of Stalingrad in Operation Winter Storm.\n\nThe army was then given reinforcements including 160 new tanks. It then was able to halt the Soviet winter offensive in Southern Russia and then counterattacked in the Third Battle of Kharkov, retaking the city in March 1943. The army saw little or no action over the next three months as both sides built up their strength for the upcoming Battle of Kursk.\n\nThe army throughout the spring of 1943 was significantly reinforced and grew to a strength of 1,100 tanks and 250,000 men by July 1943. It was to form the southern spearhead in the Battle of Kursk. The army tried but failed to break through the Soviet defences around Kursk. It then fought a series of defensive battles throughout the remainder of 1943 to hold back the Red Army's Lower Dnieper Strategic Offensive Operation. By November 1943, the Soviets had reached Kiev and the 4th Panzer Army was tasked to defend the city. The Soviet aim was to take the city and break the rail link with Army Group Center or envelop Army Group South. But even though the Soviets had liberated Kiev, broken the Dnieper line, and inflicted massive casualties, the 4th Panzer Army held on and the Soviets failed to break the rail link.\n\nBy early 1944, the 4th Panzer Army had been pushed back to the pre-war 1939 Polish border. The army defended positions in Ukraine west of Kiev until late June 1944, fighting in the southern regions of the Pinsk Marshes, and around Lutsk, Shepetovka, Tarnopol, and Kovel in western Galicia. However, following the transfer of several of its panzer divisions northwards in the aftermath of Army Group Center's collapse in Operation Bagration, 4th Army was progressively outmatched and forced into a fighting withdrawal by the 1st Ukrainian Front during the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive. The right flank of 4th Army, including XIII Army Corps, was surrounded and destroyed at Brody in late July, 1944.\n\nBy August 1944, Soviet attacks forced a full retreat of the 4th Panzer Army through the area of Chełm and Lublin, ending on the west bank of the Vistula River and an initially successful attempt to contain the Soviet bridgehead at Baranow.\nThe defense along the Vistula took place from August 1944 until the renewed Soviet offensive in January 1945. By January 1945, the 4th Panzer Army was holding static defensive positions on Hitler's direct orders and during the lull in the fighting it had created a defensive zone in southern Poland.\n\nUnknown to the Wehrmacht, the Soviet command planned to saturate the entire defensive zone with artillery bombardment. The Red Army began their Vistula–Oder Offensive on January 17, quickly encircling the LVI Panzer Corps and destroying half of all armoured forces concentrated with the 4th Panzer Army. The commander of the LVI Corps, General Johannes Block, was killed in action on 26 January. The remnants of the army retreated along the entire front before re-grouping on the western bank of the Oder River in February 1945.\n\nThe Red Army halted its offensive in February 1945. The 3rd Panzer Army was tasked to halt the Soviets in the north, while the 9th Army was guarding against the Soviets in the centre. During February 1945, the 4th Panzer Army defended along the Oder River, containing the Soviet bridgehead at Steinau on the Oder. In March and the first half of April 1945, the army concentrated on defenses along the Lusatian Neisse River between Görlitz and Guben.\n\nOn April 16, 1945, the Red Army renewed its offensive by crossing the Oder River. While the 9th Army held the Soviet forces at the Battle of Seelow Heights, the 4th Panzer Army was being pushed back. V Corps of the retreating 4th Panzer Army was pushed into the operational region of the German 9th Army, forming a pocket of some 80,000 men. The Red Army then encircled this force in a pocket in the Spree Forest south of the Seelow Heights and west of Frankfurt. Some of the 4th Panzer Army troops trapped in the Halbe Pocket broke out to the west and surrendered to the US Army on the west bank of the Elbe River. The bulk of the 4th Panzer Army was pushed south of Dresden into the Ore Mountains where it surrendered to the Red Army in the wake of the early May 1945 Prague Offensive.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, one of the 4th Panzer Army former commanders, Hermann Hoth, was tried in the High Command Trial, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. Explaining his harsh measures against Jews and other civilians, he claimed that \"it was a matter of common knowledge in Russia that it was the Jew in particular who participated in a very large extent in sabotage, espionage, etc.\" Hoth was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. On 27 October 1948, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In January 1951, the sentence was reviewed with no changes. Hoth was released on parole in 1954; his sentence was reduced to time served in 1957.\n\n\n"}

He had been an all-American football player at the University of Southern California.\n\nFerraro was born May 24, 1924, in the working class suburb of Cudahy, California, just south of Los Angeles, \"the youngest son of a family of eight children whose Italian immigrant parents ran a macaroni factory before going broke during the Depression.\" He attended Bell High School in Bell, California, where he graduated in 1942, and he earned a bachelor of science degree in business administration from the University of Southern California after World War II.\n\nFerraro enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was commissioned as an ensign in 1945. He served on a tanker with Warren Christopher, later the Secretary of State under Bill Clinton. \"Christopher got Ferraro interested in politics during long, early morning discussions when they were stationed in the Bay Area.\"\n\nHis excellence on the football field at Bell High—he was a unanimous choice for the All-City team—led to his receiving a scholarship at USC, where he earned All-American honors in 1944 and 1947 and played as a tackle in three Rose Bowls. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. As an adult he stood 6 feet, 4¼ inches tall and weighed 245 pounds, earning him the nickname \"Big John.\"\n\nFerraro was an insurance broker with the John Ferraro Company, beginning in 1951, and he invested shrewdly in stocks and real estate that made him a millionaire.\n\nHe was married to Julie Marie Luckey, daughter of Democratic State Senator E. George Luckey, and they had a son, Luckeygian, or Lucky, born about 1956. The Ferraros were divorced in 1972. His second wife was Bridget Margaret Hart, widely known as exotic dancer and stripteaser Margie Hart in the 1940s—and then as a legitimate actress who even later made money through real-estate investments. They met at a reception in support of Democrat Pierre Salinger's unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 1964, and they were married in 1982. She died in 2000.\n\nFerraro was diagnosed with cancer of the spleen in August 1999 and underwent chemotherapy. Mayor Richard Riordan was at his side, along with family members, when he died at the age of 76 in Santa Monica on April 17, 2001. A crowd of nearly a thousand filled St. Brendan Catholic Church, Ferraro's parish, for a funeral mass conducted by Cardinal Roger Mahony. Family present included Ferraro's brother, Steve, sisters Mary and Rose and his son, Gianni Luckey.\n\nHe entered government service in 1953, when Mayor Norris Poulson appointed him to the city Police Commission, where he served for thirteen years. During that period, he advocated more-stringent gun laws and backed African-American John Roseboro, former Los Angeles Dodgers star, to do community relations work for the Police Department after the 1965 Watts riots.\n\n\"See also List of Los Angeles Municipal election returns, 1967 and after\"\n\nSupported by Mayor Sam Yorty and seen as a \"product of the old guard of conservative if nominally Democratic politicians who used to dominate local politics,\" he was appointed in May 1966 from among thirteen applicants to represent Los Angeles City Council District 4 after the death of incumbent Harold A. Henry. Because of his height, when he took office carpenters had to remove a drawer from his desk so that his legs could fit under it.\n\nDuring his term, which at thirty-five years was the longest in City Council history, the 4th District covered (in 1955) much of the Wilshire district and in general was bounded by Fountain Avenue, Wilshire Boulevard, Fairfax Avenue and Catalina Street and (in 1975) Central Los Angeles from Fairfax and Highland Avenues on the west, to Santa Monica Boulevard on the north, the Pasadena Freeway on the east and Olympic Boulevard on the south (1945). In 1986 it was considered a contorted district that included the old areas as well as Atwater, Griffith Park, Forest Lawn Drive and parts of the central San Fernando Valley to Colfax Avenue and Victory Boulevard. In 1989 the district stretched from Hancock Park to Studio City.\n\nIn 1974, Ferraro ran unsuccessfully against fellow Councilman Edmund D. Edelman for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and in 1985, he made a futile run against Tom Bradley for mayor.\n\nIn 1999, he was fined $3,300 by the Los Angeles Ethics Commission for receiving campaign contributions in 1997 above a newly established limit. It and penalties levied against Councilmen Mike Hernandez and Mark Ridley-Thomas were the first to be made under a law effective in 1985.\n\nFerraro's election as City Council president in 1977 to replace John Gibson allowed him to make committee appointments and set a general direction for the council. In that year he restructured the committee system to \"reflect concerns about the environment and city finances.\" It advanced him to the second most powerful position in the city and made him acting mayor when Tom Bradley was out of town. Ferraro later denied he used his committee appointing power \"to reward allies and punish enemies,\" but he admitted to being practical: \"Anybody who mistreats their friends to benefit their enemies is not practicing good politics,\" he said. \"You don't get reelected to the presidency that way.\"\n\nIn Ferraro's 1997 reshuffle of committee seats, the biggest loser was Nate Holden, \"the frequent butt of Ferraro's jokes, who was ousted from all three of his committees and given far lower-profile assignments,\" Jodi Wilgoren reported in the \"Los Angeles Times.\"\n\nIt was said that Ferraro often calmed disputes on the City Council \"with humor and a firm hand\" and that after his death it was \"unlikely such a dominant figure will again emerge,\" because of newly imposed term limits at City Hall.\n\nFerraro was noted for \"spearheading the refurbishment of the Los Angeles Zoo\", for \"bringing the new Staples Center arena to a revitalized downtown\" and helping to attract the 2000 Democratic National Convention to Los Angeles. Other activities:\n\n1984. Ferraro's \"biggest citywide leadership role was in helping bring the Olympics to Los Angeles, serving on early committees trying to attract the Games.\"\n\n1985. Ferraro was considered pro-development, and he usually supported most everything that building industry leaders wanted, one exception being rent control because of the large number of elderly renters in his district.\n\n1989. He opposed building underground transportation lines (subways), believing instead that mass transit should run along freeways or, in the San Fernando Valley, along existing rail lines.\n\n1996. The City Council president opposed Mayor Richard Riordan's plans for a City Charter revision commission to be elected by the voters, on the grounds that it would be chaotic and would undermine the council's authority. He wanted a committee of experts in public policy and constitutional law appointed by the City Council itself. In the end, both panels were set up and worked on their own drafts for a charter revision.\n\n1997. With County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, Ferraro opposed a plan by Universal Studios to add 5.9 million square feet to its theme park attractions in Universal City, with resort hotels and additional parking lots. The two legislators urged the proposal be cut by 40%.\n\nFerraro was elected to the board of the National League of Cities in 1995, and in March 1996 the Los Angeles Marathon named him Citizen of the Year, the University of Southern California gave him its Asa V. Call Achievement Award and the National Council of Young Israel gave him a community-service award.\n\nFor his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, he was honored with a Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \"Court of Honor\" plaque by the Coliseum commissioners.\n\nOn November 16, 2000, in honor of his more than five decades of public service, the City of Los Angeles renamed the landmark Department of Water and Power's General Office Building to the John Ferraro Building. The building was designed by the architects AC Martin Partners, Inc. and opened in 1964.\n\nThe Margaret and John Ferraro Chair in Effective Local Government was established at the School of Policy, Planning and Development of the University of Southern California.\n\n\nAccess to some \"Los Angeles Times\" links may require the use of a library card.\n\n"}
{"id": "2331351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331351", "title": "Air gap (plumbing)", "text": "Air gap (plumbing)\n\nAn air gap, as it relates to the plumbing trade, is the unobstructed vertical space between the water outlet and the flood level of a fixture. Air gaps of appropriate design are required for water safety by legislation in many countries. A related term in computer security is Air gap (networking). \n\nA simple example is the space between a wall mounted faucet and the sink rim (this space is the air gap). Water can easily flow from the faucet into the sink, but there is no way that water can flow from the sink into the faucet without modifying the system. This arrangement will prevent any contaminants in the sink from flowing into the potable water system by siphonage and is the least expensive form of backflow prevention.\n\nA common use of the term \"air gap\" in home plumbing refers to a fixture that provides back-flow prevention for an installed dishwasher. This \"air gap\" is seen above the sink as a small cylindrical fixture mounted parallel with the faucet. In the base cabinet under the sink, the drain hose from the dishwasher feeds the \"top\" of the air gap, and the \"bottom\" of the air gap is plumbed into the sink drain below the basket, or into a garbage disposal unit. When installed and maintained properly, the air gap works as described above, and prevents drain water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher, possibly contaminating dishes.\n\nTo further illustrate the air gap, consider what could happen if the air gap were eliminated by attaching a hose to the faucet and lowering the hose into a sink full of contaminated water. Under the right conditions (if the water supply loses pressure and the sink is higher than the point at which the water supply enters the house, for instance), the dirty water in the sink will be siphoned into the water pipes through the hose and faucet. The dirty water then will be dispersed throughout the drinking water system.\n\nAll plumbing codes require backflow prevention in several ways. The fixtures are manufactured to meet these codes. Plumbers must not build cross-connections in their daily work practices, and plumbing inspectors look for improper designs or connections of piping and plumbing fixtures. A common misconception is that a \"high loop\" (routing a drain line above a sink's flood level, for instance) will provide the same function as an air gap; this is not true, because the continuous connection in such a case still will allow backflow through siphoning.\n\nAccording to the \"International Residential Code 2003\", an air gap must meet the requirements of being two times the effective inner diameter of the pipe (2*D) in order to be sufficient.\n\nA standard widely use in the United States is:\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, legislation is by statutory instrument and vary by country, but include Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2016\nand Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations (Wales). The categorisation of air gaps is standardised by European standards, which cover the basic design and dimensions for appropriate to different uses.\n"}

The army fought as part of the Red Army on the Eastern Front during World War II. The army was commanded throughout most of the war by Mikhail Katukov. It fought in the early defense during the Battle of Stalingrad, and Operation Uranus, also participated at the Battle of Kursk, Proskurov-Chernovtsy Operation, Lvov-Sandomierz Operation, Vistula-Oder Offensive and the Battle of Berlin. After the war, the army was stationed in East Germany as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. \n\nAfter the end of the Cold War and the resultant withdrawal of Soviet units in Germany, the army was relocated to Smolensk, disbanded in 1999. The army was reformed in 2014 as part of a Russian military expansion.\n\nThe 1st Tank Army was first formed within the Stalingrad Front from 38th Army in July 1942, under the command of Major General Kirill Moskalenko. The army was encircled and partially destroyed, and was disbanded as a result in August 1942, its headquarters becoming the Southeastern Front headquarters. \n\nThe 1st Tank Army was formed a second time on 30 January 1943 (order No.46021) from the headquarters of the 29th Army, under the command of famous armoured troops commander Lieutenant General of Tank Troops Mikhail Katukov, personally appointed by Stalin. The army was transferred to the North-Western Front. 3rd Mechanised Corps (later to become 8th Guards Mechanised Corps) and 6th Tank Corps (later to become 11th Guards Tank Corps) joined it on formation, and served with the army throughout the war. It was quickly transferred to Voronezh Front for the defense of the Kursk salient's southern shoulder. It was awarded a Guards title and became the 1st Guards Tank Army in April 1944, and Katukov was promoted to Colonel General.\n\nOn 1 January 1945, the Army's principal combat formations were:\n\n\nIt participated in the Battle of Kursk, the Proskurov-Chernovtsy Operation, Lvov-Sandomierz Operation, the Vistula-Oder Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin.\n\nThe 1st Guards Tank Army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner postwar, and became part of the Soviet occupation force in Germany, known as Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, with its headquarters in Dresden. In 1968, it, along with the 11th Guards Tank and 20th Guards Motor Rifle Divisions, took part in the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, but then immediately returned to their respective garrisons. In the late 1980s the Army included the 20th Guards Motor Rifle Division, 9th Tank Division, and 11th Guards Tank Division. The headquarters was withdrawn to Smolensk, in the Moscow Military District in the early 1990s, and lost the 'Tank' from its title in 1995. In its last period within the Russian Army it comprised the 4th Guards 'Kantemir' Tank Division and the 144th Motor Rifle Division (which had been withdrawn from Tallinn in Estonia). It was disbanded in 1998.\n\nThe army's composition in 1988 was (with main equipment), with honorific titles in italics:\n\n\nAfter a 15-year break, the Army was reconstituted in November 2014, seemingly on 13 November 2014.\n\nThe army was formed as the main ground forces manoeuvre and reserve operational formation of the Western Military District in addition to the 6th Combined Arms Army (headquartered in Saint Petersburg) and the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army (headquartered in Voronezh). It is considered the elite of the Russian Ground Forces. The army carries on the traditions of the chronologically first army of the Soviet Union to reach \"'Guards\"' status. Further it has the 2nd Motor Rifle and the 4th Tank guards divisions, which are considered the elite formations of their respective combat arms. The most decorated divisions of the Soviet Army, they were garrisoned the closest to Moscow. Due to their proximity to the capitol their personnel was put to extra scrutiny, they were considered a very prestigious posting, received the latest hardware and thus known as the 'household' divisions of the Soviet Army. Their loyalty to the regime was demonstrated by their involvement in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt. The divisions retained their elite status within the Russian Army.\n\nToday the Army is composed of:\n\n\n\n"}

Bernson, known as Hal Bernson, (born 1930) was a Northridge, California, clothier who was a Los Angeles City Council member for 24 years, from 1979 until his retirement in 2003. A conservative Republican, he was a leading proponent of the San Fernando Valley seceding from the rest of Los Angeles.\n\nBernson was born in South Gate, California, on November 19, 1930, to Jewish parents, his father from Romania and his mother from Poland. He grew up in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights. where he became a Bar Mitzvah at the historic Breed Street Shul. He recalled that at the age of ten he attended services at the synagogue three times a day to recite a mourner's prayer for his father. As a young man, he served in the Navy and afterward ran a clothing store in Bakersfield. He moved back to Los Angeles in 1956 and to the San Fernando Valley in 1958.\n\nHe and his wife, Robyn, had three daughters, Nicole, Holly and Sarah. They lived in Northridge, California. Holleigh Bernson, an \"aspiring film director,\" was killed in a one-car traffic accident in October 1995 when she lost control of her car in a night drive through Griffith Park and it went off the road. Named in tribute to Holly Golightly, the Audrey Hepburn character in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" she had changed her name to Holleigh Rox-Anne Bernson. A city park in the Porter Ranch area of the San Fernando Valley was named in her honor, and Bernson gave $70,000 from his City Council discretionary fund to the American Film Institute to fund a scholarship named for her.\n\nBernson was known as \"a man with a volatile temper, a tenacious politician with little tolerance for bureaucratic delays and council members who question his efforts.\" He was also said to be \"often gruff\" and \"impatient with schmoozing.\"\n\nIn 2008 he was consulting on land use, transportation, environmental and government affairs.\n\nBernson listed these activities on his résumé:\n\n\nHe was also a cofounder and board member of CIVICC (Committee Investigating Valley Independence for the City/County). In partisan politics, he was a Republican.\n\n\"See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1979 and after.\"\n\nBernson and Barbara Klein led the pack of sixteen candidates who in 1979 ran in Los Angeles City Council District 12, in the northwest San Fernando Valley, to succeed retiring Councilman Robert M. Wilkinson. In the runoff, Bernson easily beat Klein by a vote of 24,825 to 12,415.\n\nBernson was reelected in every vote thereafter until his own retirement in 2003, although in 1991 he was forced into a runoff with Julie Korenstein, who was one of the challengers who attacked him for backing the controversial Porter Ranch development in his district (below). It was, however, not strictly true that Bernson was \"pro-growth,\" the \"Times\" reported during that campaign, listing several incidents in which the councilman had voted against developers' wishes. Bernson. a \"conservative Republican,\" labeled Korenstein as \"at one time . . . a Peace and Freedom member.\"\n\nBernson was dubbed \"Mister Earthquake,\" for his driven attitude toward making city building safe in the event of temblors. The \"Times\" said of him:\n\nAfter all, he has been the most avid proponent of seismic safety on the Los Angeles City Council for more than a decade, spearheading a slew of safety-minded ordinances, including a widely copied law requiring the retrofitting of thousands of unreinforced masonry buildings. . . . He took an interest in seismic safety and decided to back the proposal, warding off angry building owners and others. Some apartment owners bused in elderly tenants to testify at council hearings that their rents would go up, possibly leaving them homeless if such a law passed. But the law did pass, in 1981. A few years later, he helped organize the city's first international earthquake conference, attended by 28 countries. He also developed a quake safety booklet for children and help create the \"Quakey-Shakey Van,\" a vehicle that helps teach children about quake safety.\n\nNevertheless, Bernson refused aid from the Community Redevelopment Agency in rebuilding damage in his district from the 1994 Northridge earthquake on the grounds that the agency was trying to foist \"social engineering\" off on the area under the guise of earthquake reconstruction.\n\nIn 1997 he was given the Alfred E. Alquist Award for Achievement in Earthquake Safety.\n\nHe was chair of the council's Transportation Committee. He also served on the boards of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Southern California Regional Rail Authority. He was described as \"a master of planning issues.\"\n\nIn 2002, at age 71 and cited as the \"dean of the Los Angeles City Council, he was serving as chairman of the LACMTA, the rail authority and the Southern California Association of Governments at the same time. The \"Times\" noted that Bernson's service on these boards made him the \"Stipend King\" of the City Council because he was able to collect thousands of dollars in extra pay for attending their meetings. \"I put in an awful lot of extra effort in those things I'm involved in,\" he said.\n\nBernson was presented the first Julian C. Dixon Award in November 2002 as \"a leader in transportation [who had] made an outstanding contribution to the transportation community.\"\n\nBus tour. The councilman guided his colleagues on a bus tour of his district in May 1989, pointing out such problem sites as the proposed 1,300-acre Porter Ranch development, \"where a plan to develop the pristine rolling hills into a major $2-billion residential and commercial city center is at the forefront of public debate,\" and a development project in the Bryant-Street Vanalden neighborhood (below).\n\nCompromise. Mayor Tom Bradley announced in December 1989 that he and Bernson had reached a compromise on the Porter Ranch project in Chatsworth, the biggest single development project in Los Angeles history.\n\nBernson took a leading role in a drive at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries for the San Fernando Valley to secede from the city of Los Angeles and perhaps even from the county. As well, the councilman advocated that the Valley pull out of the Los Angeles Unified School District and form its own district for its own schools. He called the proposal the \"hottest issue around\"\" and said the current school system was \"a farce.\"\n\nLater, he was a member of the county's Local Area Formation Commission, even while he was a \"vocal advocate of speeding up the process\" of getting Valley secession on the November 2002 ballot. Despite his statement that he would be neutral as a commissioner, City Council president Alex Padilla replaced him on the commission in August 2001 with Council Member Cindy Miscikowski, a secession opponent.\n\nIn 1992, it was reported that the California Fair Political Practices Commission had opened \"five separate inquiries into charges of various improprieties against Bernson, but each time closed its files without formal charges\" being made.\n\nThe city's Ethics Commission found in 1994 that Bernson had failed to disclose the source of $11,000 in campaign contributions made by a private company and ordered him to repay the funds. While rejecting the commission's authority requiring him to repay the money, he said he would donate an equal sum to the police in his district.\n\nIn 1997 Bernson ended a two-year battle with the Ethics Commission by paying a $1,500 fine levied against him for spending $1,140 in officeholder account funds to buy season tickets to the Hollywood Bowl. The account is funded by lobbyists and supporters and can be used only on expenses related to serving and communicating with constituents. It was the first case of its kind brought against an elected official since the commission was created in 1990.\n\nLater the same year, the Ethics Commission rejected a Bernson request to let his staff use Hollywood Bowl tickets that were intended for poor and disabled constituents, after about a hundred of them were left unused because residents who had asked for the complimentary passes never claimed them.\n\nThree years later, the Ethics Commission and Bernson agreed that he would pay a $3,000 fine \"for improperly accepting an excess amount of free legal services from the law firm of City Hall lobbyist Neil Papiano,\" who had represented Bernson in the Hollywood Bowl case. The law firm was also fined.\n\nIn 2001 he agreed that he would pay fines of $18,500 for accepting campaign contributions that exceeded legal limits. \"There is no evidence that the violations were committed intentionally or willfully,\" a written agreement stipulated.\n\nAn investigative feature by the \"Times\" found in April 1990 that Bernson was the \"top travel spender\" in City Hall, having paid out $120,622 of his campaign funds in three years for trips to places like Louisiana, Hawaii, Israel and Italy, in the latter two of which he and his wife stayed in \"luxury hotels.\" Other trips were made by the couple to Paris, Hong Kong, London, Beijing, British Columbia, New York, Seattle, Boston and Carmel, California. He said the trips were proper and enabled him to do a better job as a councilman.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bernson was \"the major foe\" of a controversial proposed enlargement of a landfill project, or dump, in Sunshine Canyon in Granada Hills, at the eastern end of the Santa Susana Mountains. In 1992 he sued Browning-Ferris Industries, operator of the landfill, for libel, alleging that the company \"leaked to news reporters a dossier containing false claims about Bernson's spending of public and private funds on travel\" (above) in an attempt to discredit him. A Superior Court judge dismissed the action, but the State Supreme Court reinstated it in June 1994, ruling 4–2 that \" the usual one-year time limit for filing libel lawsuits can be extended when defendants accused of disseminating allegedly defamatory material intentionally conceal their identities.\"\n\nSlum conditions. Bernson pushed a proposal through the City Council in 1985 that would have made it easier to evict some of the three thousand tenants in the crime-plagued, predominantly Latino Bryant Street-Vanalden Avenue neighborhood of Northridge, but backed off when Mayor Tom Bradley said he would veto it.\n\nThe councilman said he \"packed\" a meeting in December 1985 with more than seven hundred Northridge residents, most of them Anglos who \"repeatedly cheered\" their approval of Bernson's controversial proposal to force out some of the tenants. He said he did so because Mayor Bradley had not invited him to the meeting even though the problem neighborhood was in Bernson's district.\n\nFour years later, he said his efforts had paid off in transforming \"some of the worst slums in L.A.\" into an \"ornate gated community.\"\n\nPornography. He won approval in 1985 of an ordinance prohibiting new adult businesses, such as sexually oriented movie theaters, bookstores and night clubs, from opening within 500 feet of churches, homes and schools.\n\nSalvadorans. Bernson was the only \"no\" vote in 1987 on a City Council offer of $10,000 for relocation assistance for Central American refugees allegedly threatened by El Salvador death squads.\n\nProstitution. The City Council acceded to his idea of publicizing the names of the men (and the few women) who were arrested for patronizing prostitutes.\n\nLieutenant governor. In 1989, Bernson's opening a campaign fund for a purported race for lieutenant governor drew criticism from California Common Cause as a way to circumvent the city's campaign contribution limits. He rejected the charge.\n\nToilets.

Seaman, based on Neil B. Shulman's book, \"What? Dead...Again?\". The film stars Michael J. Fox, Julie Warner, Barnard Hughes, Woody Harrelson, David Ogden Stiers, Frances Sternhagen and Bridget Fonda.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Micanopy, Florida and McIntosh, Florida.\n\nHaving completed his medical residency in a Washington, D.C. hospital, Dr. Benjamin Stone drives to Beverly Hills for a job interview with noted plastic surgeon, Dr. Halberstrom. While passing through Grady, South Carolina, Stone smashes into a fence to avoid hitting a cow. The fence belongs to Judge Evans, who then sentences him to 32 hours of community service at the town's medical clinic. Mayor Nick Nicholson and a reception committee greet Stone, hoping to hire him to replace Dr. Aurelius Hogue, who is eager to retire. While his car is being repaired, Stone tends to patients and flirts with ambulance driver Vialula (better known as \"Lou\"), a single mother of a four-year-old daughter. Local insurance agent Hank Gordon also courts Lou, while Nancy Lee, the mayor's daughter, pursues Stone.\n\nThe town's residents begin integrating Stone into their small-town life. Hogue initially dismisses Stone as too young and inexperienced until Stone saves his life from a heart attack. Grateful, Hogue privately calls Halberstrom explaining Stone's delay due to his enforced community service, while Judge Evans releases Stone from his remaining sentence. On the eve of Stone's departure, he shares an intimate evening with Lou. Unwilling to exploit the situation or incite Hank's jealousy, Stone secretly leaves town at night. Near the town's reservoir, Stone happens upon a local man whose wife is in labor inside their car. After a short hesitation, Stone stops to help. During the delivery, Stone's car is once again damaged when a fatigued truck driver rams into it.\n\nStone prepares to leave the next day. The community has chipped in and bought him a plane ticket to Los Angeles. Lou, not wanting Stone to waste his talents in a small town, suppresses her feelings and tells him she is marrying Hank.\n\nDr. Halberstrom hires Stone based on Hogue's recommendation. Beverly Hills' superficiality soon leaves Stone, who grew up in a small town, feeling empty and lonely. A few weeks later, Hank and Nancy Lee arrive in Los Angeles, bringing Stone's repaired car with them. After Hank tells Stone that he and Lou broke off their engagement, Stone returns to Grady and reunites with her.\n\n\nThe film's soundtrack features the Chesney Hawkes song \"The One and Only\", which reached number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart. It also includes Filip Kutev's \"Polegnala e Todora,\" although his name is spelled Philip Kouter.\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe film was met with positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 68% based on reviews from 34 critics. The critical consensus reads: \"\"Doc Hollywood\" isn't particularly graceful in its attempt to put a '90s spin on its Capraesque formula, but a light touch and a charming cast make its flaws easy to forgive.\"\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"Mr. Fox, blithe and funny as ever, amusingly shrugs off each new surprise the film has to offer\", adding that \"while retaining his boyish appeal, Mr. Fox also seems a shade more substantial this time, possibly because he is seen making life-or-death decisions when not fielding comic lines.\" She did, however, say that \"the screenplay, by Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman and Daniel Pyne, is occasionally sharp-tongued but more often pleasantly knee-deep in rustic corn.\"\n\nPeter Rainer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" remarked that \"If you have any doubt as to the outcome, you haven’t been paying attention to the latest self-serving movie trend. The back-to-basics, anti-greed message of 'Doc Hollywood' has been all over the screens this season, from TV’s 'Northern Exposure' to the movies’ 'City Slickers,' 'Regarding Henry,' 'Life Stinks' and 'The Doctor.'\" He added:\n\nRoger Ebert rated the film a 3 out of 4 stars stating \"On the basis of the movie's trailer, I was expecting \"Doc Hollywood\" to be a comedy. And it is a comedy. But it surprised me by also being a love story, and a pretty good one – the kind where the lovers are smart enough to know all the reasons why they shouldn't get together, but too much in love to care.\"\n\n\"Doc Hollywood\" debuted at number three in the U.S. box office.\n\nThe makers of the Disney/Pixar film \"Cars\" have been accused of plagiarizing its plot from this film. \"Many reviewers also felt that \"Cars\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> plot was too indebted to the 1991 Michael J Fox comedy \"Doc Hollywood\", in which a hotshot Los Angeles doctor learns a new set of values when he is stranded in an average American town. 'It just rips off \"Doc Hollywood\", almost note for note,' said Christy Lemire of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\".\" Critic Simon Kinnear of \"Total Film\" concurred, stating \"Actually, this one pretty much is just <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"Doc Hollywood\" with cars.'\"\n\n"}

The Archbishop of Canterbury is \"ex officio\" the President of the Council. The current chair of the ACC is Paul Kwong.\n\nMembers of the council include the Archbishop of Canterbury and a certain number of representatives of each of the Anglican provinces, depending on the size of the province.\n\nThe largest provinces are entitled to appoint three representatives, consisting of one bishop, one priest, and one layperson. Intermediate sized provinces may appoint two persons: one layperson and one ordained (either bishop or priest). The smallest provinces appoint only one person, preferably from among the laity. Additionally, the Council may co-opt up to six additional members of whom two shall be women and two persons not over 28 years of age at the time of appointment.\n\nIf the chairperson or the vice-chair of the council should be elected to this position for a term which exceeds the term of his or her appointment to the council, his or her council membership is extended until the expiration of the term as chair, while the province to which he or she belongs is entitled to make an additional appointment.\n\nFor the purposes of apportioning the membership on the Anglican Consultative Council, the large provinces are considered to be:\n\n\nIntermediate-sized provinces are:\n\nThe smallest provinces include:\n\nAccording to the 1968 resolution, the council has eight functions:\n\nThe 13th meeting of the ACC was concerned with the controversy surrounding the policies about homosexuality, particularly the consecration of openly homosexual bishops.

It stated support in the Anglican Communion to reaffirmed “the standard of Christian teaching on matters of human sexuality expressed in the 1998 Lambeth Resolution 1.10, It also repeated the position stated at the 2005 Primates' Meeting, that the Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada needed to \"voluntarily withdraw their members\" from the ACC—including its \"Standing Committee and the Inter-Anglican Finance and Administration Committee\" until the next Lambeth Conference in 2008.\n\nThe 2016 meeting of the ACC made its Resolutions against a background of contentious debates and divided votes regarding homosexuality in the and the boycott by 230 bishops including six Prelates of the over the same issue.

The film was directed by Peter Collinson and produced by Harry Alan Towers. This was the second of three versions of Christie's novel to be adapted to the screen by producer Harry Alan Towers. Two film adaptations were previously released (a 1945 version by René Clair and the 1965 adaptation \"Ten Little Indians\"). An American made-for-television version was broadcast in 1959. Towers produced a third version in 1989.\n\nA group of ten people, strangers to one another, have all travelled to a hotel located deep in the deserts of Iran. Upon arrival they discover that their host is mysteriously absent. At dinner, they notice a display of figurines; the Ten Little Indians, as represented in the doggerel in each of their suites. They are accused via a tape recording by the host, U.N. Owen (\"unknown\"), someone none of them has ever met, of having committed various crimes in the past which went unpunished by the law.\n\nOne by one, the guests start to die; first Michel Raven whose drink was poisoned. During the night, the housekeeper/cook, Elsa Martino, makes a mad dash to escape, only to be strangled against a pillar; a method of Ancient Persian execution, as noted by Hugh Lombard. A search of the hotel is intimated by General Salve who splits everyone into pairs. Not long after everyone separates from each other, Salve is stabbed to death in the hotel's catacombs. Their search reveals there is no one in the desert, except their seven selves, and that there is a killer in their midst who is one of them.\n\nThe next morning, Elsa's husband, the butler, attempts to escape into the desert, only to expire from heat and exhaustion; his survival kit having been sabotaged. Ilona reveals her tragic past to the others, exposing the cause of her husband's suicide. Later, she is found dead, bitten by a venomous snake. The lights soon short out, leaving the five remaining guests in the dark, where at dinner, they reveal the nature of the crimes they stand accused of. Before Vera can offer her explanation, she leaves the others to return to her room. She screams, and the others rush to her. In the confusion, Judge Cannon is found dead in his bedroom, shot in the head.\n\nDr. Armstrong poses his suspicions of Vera, and has her locked in her room. Hugh comes to Vera during the night to give her his gun, and reveals that he is in fact Charles Morley; the real Lombard had committed suicide and he took his place instead. In return, Vera herself confesses that she never committed murder and instead was secretly covering up for her mentally ill sister.\n\nIn the morning, Dr. Armstrong is nowhere to be found. A search of the ruins leads to Blore being pushed to his death off a ledge. Vera and Morley find the body of Dr. Armstrong in the ruins and realise they are the only two remaining.\n\nVera shoots at Morley and returns to the hotel where she finds all the furniture sheeted up once more, except for a chair with a noose above. She finds Judge Cannon alive, who reveals how he tricked Dr. Armstrong into helping him fake his \"murder\", and how he wanted to seek perfect justice and perform his duty as an executioner of the guilty. He tries to convince Vera to hang herself to avoid being publicly executed as the last remaining person alive, the most likely to be the murderer. He drinks poison, and prepares to die, right before Morley appears before him alive. Cannon chokes on the poison and realises his scheme has been foiled before he dies. With Cannon dead, Vera and Morley are picked up by a helicopter as the tape recording is replayed.\n\n\nThe 1974 film reuses the script of the 1965 version, even calling Oliver Reed's character \"Hugh\" instead of \"Phillip,\" which was the character's name in the novel and play. It is set in an abandoned hotel in the Iranian desert.\n\nHerbert Lom, who plays Dr. Armstrong in this film, also starred in the 1989 version, as the General (played by Adolfo Celi in this version).\n\nMuch of the film was shot on location in pre-revolution Iran. These included the Shah Abbas Hotel in Isfahan (now known as the Abbasi Hotel), Persepolis and the Bam Citadel. Other locations used are the Temple of Debod in Madrid and Almería in Andalucía, Spain.\n\nThe European cut of the film featured a pre-credit sequence that showed the guests arriving by plane before boarding a helicopter to be transported to the hotel.

{"id": "2331385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331385", "title": "The Outrageous Okona", "text": "The Outrageous Okona\n\n\"The Outrageous Okona\" ( ) is the fourth episode of the of the American science fiction television series \"\", the 30th episode overall. It was first aired on December 12, 1988, in broadcast syndication. It was written by Les Menchen, Lance Dickson and David Landsberg, with a teleplay by Burton Armus, and directed by Robert Becker.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the crew of the \"Enterprise\" encounters a flamboyant space rogue, while Data tries to learn humor from a holographic comedian.\n\nThis episode guest stars William O. Campbell.\n\nAs the Federation starship \"Enterprise\", under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, passes through the Coalition of Madena, it detects a small cargo ship, under manual control by its single occupant. The crew makes contact with the pilot, Captain Thadiun Okona (William O. Campbell), who requests help to repair a part on his ship. Captain Picard agrees, and the \"Enterprise\" tows Okona's ship while Okona is brought on board. The crew soon finds that Okona has taken a keen interest in the women on the ship, beginning with Transporter Chief Robinson (Teri Hatcher in an uncredited role) and is in no rush to effect repairs.\n\nContinuing through the sector, the \"Enterprise\" is set upon by ships from two different planets, each of which locks its weapons upon the \"Enterprise\", though both are vastly outclassed, and pose no actual threat. Debin (Douglas Rowe), from the planet Atlec, accuses Okona of impregnating his daughter Yanar (Rosalind Ingledew), while Kushell (Albert Stratton) from the planet Straleb asserts that Okona has stolen a state treasure, the Jewel of Thesia. The two leaders clearly know each other, and both demand that their own claim on Okona take priority. Okona denies both accusations but offers nothing to defend himself with. Picard offers to arbitrate the dispute, and brings Debin, Yanar, Kushell and Benzan (Kieran Mulroney), Kushell's son, aboard the \"Enterprise\". Okona sits and quietly listens to both Debin and Kushell's arguments but does not offer any evidence to defend himself from both allegations.\n\nAfter much more arguing amongst the two leaders, Okona then declares that he is the father of Yanar's child, and offers to marry her. Benzan then declares that the Jewel of Thesia hasn't been stolen: it is revealed that Okona has been acting as a go-between for Yanar and Benzan, who are in love with each other, and that Yanar is pregnant with Benzan's child; Benzan has offered to marry Yanar, intending to present the Jewel of Thesia, which he asserts is rightly his, as a courting gift. Okona was carrying the jewel between the two planets when he got engine trouble, and he only falsely claimed to be the father to force the two lovers to reveal the truth. Picard cannot get involved in the internal political disputes between the two planets and allows Okona to go on his way once his ship is repaired, and Debin and Kushell are left to argue about wedding details.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt. Commander Data is motivated to explore the concept of humor after meeting Okona. Prompted by Guinan, Data uses the holodeck to generate a comedy club setting and stand-up comic (played by Joe Piscopo) as his adviser, but when he performs in front of the holographic audience, he is dismayed to find that they are predisposed to laugh at anything he says or does. As the \"Enterprise\" parts with Okona, Data is able to unintentionally make the crew laugh, but does not at first understand the joke himself.\n\nBilly Campbell was credited as William O. Campbell for his role as Okona, differentiating him from William Campbell who appeared in the \"\" episodes \"The Squire of Gothos\" and \"The Trouble with Tribbles\". Billy Campbell was a candidate for the role of Commander William T. Riker, but executive producer Rick Berman has explained that the executives casting the series considered Campbell to be \"too soft\" and the role went to Jonathan Frakes instead. He went on to appear in movies such as \"The Rocketeer\" and television series such as \"Once and Again\" and \"Helix\".\n\nJerry Lewis had been scheduled to appear in \"The Outrageous Okona\", but was unable to play the role of the Comic due to a conflict with a guest appearance on \"Wiseguy\". Instead, Joe Piscopo performed the role with Lewis in mind. Piscopo was known at the time for his previous performances on \"Saturday Night Live\", and ad-libbed the majority of his lines in \"The Outrageous Okona\". Actress Teri Hatcher was cast as Chief B.G. Robinson, but after the majority of her performance was cut from the episode, she asked not to be credited for the appearance.\n\nThe episode's score was recorded at Stage M, on the Paramount Studios lot in Hollywood. It was composed by Ron Jones, who sought to use a musical theme using french horns for Okona to show him as \"a knight in shining armor, a throwback to Errol Flynn\". This same motif is used in a manner of ways throughout the episode with Jones re-recording it using different elements of the brass section as well as modifying it electronically. For the sequences with Data on the holodeck, he opted to keep the music simple by giving those scenes a jazz background.\n\nJones was critical of the executive producer's decision not to have any music being played in the Ten Forward bar. He argued that there would be some background music in the location as opposed to silence. He offered to compose some pieces, and let the producers drop them if they did not like them but they refused. Jones had created an algorithm to estimate what music would be like in the future while lecturing in Malta and offered to use this, adding that Jimi Hendrix would be considered akin to classical music by the time period of the series. He wrote two pieces, but the producers rejected them as they did not want to have modern-day music appear in-universe.\n\nJames Hunt, in his review for the website Den of Geek, called the episode \"alright\", but criticised the lack of links between the two plots. He suggested that Okona himself was a Mary Sue type character, as the episode revolves around his actions but added that he was pleased that there was a twist which was more complicated than Okona turning out to be evil. He also praised the entertainment seen in Brent Spiner's ability to \"overact\", saying that it \"could fill an episode in itself\" and that the observation that Data makes towards the end was the most profound of the series so far.\n\nKeith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com, where he said that the \"charm and talent\" of Spiner and Campbell were what made this episode work. He also added that Patrick Stewart warranted additional praise as his reactions of annoyance to the feuding families were \"hilariously played\". DeCandido gave \"The Outrageous Okona\" a rating of five out of ten. Zack Handlen described the episode as \"lousy\" in his review for The A.V. Club, calling it \"goddamn painful\" and any scene with Piscopo was \"terrible\". He gave the episode a rating of C-.\n\n\"Variety\" magazine noted this for guest starring actress Teri Hatcher. CBR notes that this was before she had increased fame due to her role another television show in years that followed this cameo.\n\nIn 2018, CBR also noted this episode for guest starring William O. Campbell, before he became more famous due to starring in the 1991 film \"The Rocketeer\" the following year as well as other later roles in his acting career.\n\nThe episode was included on the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" season two DVD box set, released in on May 7, 2002. The most recent release was as part of the season two Blu-ray set on December 4, 2012.\n"}
{"id": "2331387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331387", "title": "Belles-lettres", "text": "Belles-lettres\n\nBelles-lettres or belles lettres is a category of writing, originally meaning beautiful or fine writing. In the modern narrow sense, it is a label for literary works that do not fall into the major categories such as fiction, poetry, or drama. The phrase is sometimes used pejoratively for writing that focuses on the aesthetic qualities of language rather than its practical application. A writer of \"belles-lettres\" is a belletrist. \n\nLiterally, \"belles-lettres\" is a French phrase meaning \"beautiful\" or \"fine\" writing. In this sense, therefore, it includes all literary works—especially fiction, poetry, drama, or essays—valued for their aesthetic qualities and originality of style and tone. The term thus can be used to refer to literature generally. The \"Nuttall Encyclopedia\", for example, described \"belles-lettres\" as the \"department of literature which implies literary culture and belongs to the domain of art, whatever the subject may be or the special form; it includes poetry, the drama, fiction, and criticism,\" while the \"Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition\" describes it as \"the more artistic and imaginative forms of literature, as poetry or romance, as opposed to more pedestrian and exact studies.\"\n\nHowever, for many modern purposes, \"belles-lettres\" is used in a narrower sense to identify literary works that do not fall into other major categories, such as fiction, poetry or drama. Thus, it would include essays, \"récits\", published collections of speeches and letters, satirical and humorous writings, and other miscellaneous works. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (2nd Edition) says that \"it is now generally applied (when used at all) to the lighter branches of literature.\" The term remains in use among librarians and others who have to classify books: while a large library might have separate categories for essays, letters, humor and so forth (and most of them are assigned different codes in, for example, the Dewey decimal classification system), in libraries of modest size they are often all grouped together under the heading \"belles-lettres\".\n\nThe phrase is sometimes used in a derogatory manner when speaking about the study of literature: those who study rhetoric often deride many language departments (particularly English departments in the English-speaking world) for focusing on the aesthetic qualities of language rather than its practical application. A quote from Brian Sutton's article in \"Language and Learning Across the Disciplines\", \"Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper\", serves to illustrate the rhetoricians' opinion on this subject and their use of the term:\n\nWriting-in-the-disciplines adherents, well aware of the wide range of academic genres a first-year composition student may have to deal with in the future, are unlikely to force those students to venture so deeply into any one genre as to require slavish imitation. The only first-year composition teachers likely to demand \"conformity and submission\" to a particular kind of academic discourse are those English-department fixtures, the evangelical disciples of literature, professors whose goal in first-year composition is to teach students to explicate \"belles lettres\". Writing-in-the-disciplines adherents, unlike teachers of literature-as-composition, generally recognize the folly of forcing students to conform to the conventions of a discourse community they have no desire to join.\n\nIn his \"Elements of Criticism\", prominent Scottish \"belles-lettres\" rhetorician Lord Kames (1696–1782) says the aim of the \"belles-lettres\" movement is to \"discover a foundation for reasoning upon the taste of an individual\" and \"design a science of rational criticism.\" The focus of the \"Belletristic Rhetoric Theory\" is on defining the characteristics of rhetorical style such as beauty, sublimity, propriety and wit all of which play a part in affecting the emotion and reasoning capabilities of the audience. Also important to those studying rhetoric and \"belles-lettres\" is defining the taste of the audience; this is key to being a truly successful rhetorician or writer. As another \"belles-lettres\" rhetorician, Hugh Blair (1718–1800), states in \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres\", \"taste is foundational to rhetoric and necessary for successful spoken and written discourse.\"\n\n"}

He was for thirty years a member of the Los Angeles City Council, where he was known for his promotion of the arts, his support of gay causes, his advocacy of rent control and other liberal measures.\n\nThe unmarried Wachs was a closeted gay man until he was preparing to run for mayor in 1999 at the age of sixty. He was asked by Bill Rosendahl, the openly gay moderator of a public affairs television show, \"Are you a gay man?\" Wachs responded: \"I am and I'm very proud of what I've done for the community, and I'm also very proud of the fact that what I've done for the community is what I've done for all communities.\"\n\nWachs was born on March 1, 1939, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of Archie and Hannah Wachs, a teacher. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland who ran a grocery and butcher shop. The younger of two sons, Joel \"suffered from hay fever so severe that at the height of the ragweed season, his parents sat him in the shop's cold storage room, in a fur coat, to help him breathe.\" They moved to Los Angeles when Wachs was ten years old, where his family became wealthy with a chain of inexpensive ladies' clothing stores. Joel grew up in Vermont Knolls, between 79th and 83rd streets and Vermont and Normandie Avenue.\n\nHe attended Horace Mann Junior High School and Washington High School, followed by UCLA, where the \"gregarious\" Wachs was president of his freshman and junior classes, and of the student body, and from whence he graduated in 1961. He earned a degree at Harvard Law School and then a master's degree in taxation from New York University. When in Los Angeles, he lived in Studio City.\n\nAfter completing his education and before beginning a public career, Wachs was an attorney with the Los Angeles firm of Gray, Binkley & Pfaelzer, which later became Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard & Quinn, and practiced law for five years. He told a reporter in 1991: \"I didn't love practicing tax law ... the result of my efforts was finding ways to save rich people money. And I didn't find that satisfying.\"\n\nWachs served on the Los Angeles City Council from July 1, 1971, to September 28, 2001, when his resignation took effect. His thirty years on the council were surpassed only by John Ferraro's thirty-five years, Ernani Bernardi's thirty-two years and Marvin Braude's thirty-one.\n\n\"See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1971 and after\n\nIn May 1971, Wachs, \"a young political newcomer,\" \"overwhelmed\" veteran James B. Potter, Jr. in Los Angeles City Council District 2, which included portions of the Santa Monica Mountains and the San Fernando Valley. The vote was 24,704 for Wachs and 14,898 for Potter. His victory was attributed in part to his opposing a multimillion-dollar development in the mountains just north of Beverly Hills.\n\nWhen he was seated, he became the City Council's youngest member at age thirty-three.\n\nIn 1986, a redistricting move stripped him of more than 90% of his old district and put him into a new one that ran from his home in Studio City to Sunland-Tujunga in the far northeast San Fernando Valley. He was nevertheless reelected in the realigned, more conservative district despite the opposition of the Los Angeles Apartment Owners Association, which attacked him because of his fight for rent control. Wachs was reelected in every vote thereafter.\n\nAfter ten years on the City Council, two of them as president pro-tem, Wachs was suddenly and unexpectedly elected Los Angeles City Council president in July 1981 when outgoing President John Ferraro decided to drop out of the contest against Councilwoman Pat Russell and, with Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson as a partner, put up Wachs as a candidate instead. Wachs was elected to a two-year term in an 8-7 vote, with Wachs breaking a pledge to Russell to vote for her and casting a vote for himself instead. He later described the turn of events as akin to a \"Hollywood movie\" and, inasmuch as Mayor Tom Bradley was soon to become a candidate for governor, he had plenty of opportunity to act as mayor when Bradley was out of town. He served for two years.\n\n\"Wachs defied easy categorization on the council, emerging as a populist who railed against what he saw as insider dealing in City Hall and misuse of taxpayer funds. He also was a staunch advocate for the arts and for civil rights.\" He was known as a \"moderate to liberal Republican\" but reregistered as an independent before running for mayor in 1993. He backed efforts that resulted in public financing of city elections and creation of an ethics commission.\n\nNeighborhood councils. Wachs is sometimes cited as the originator of neighborhood councils in Los Angeles. He organized the first ones—in Studio City, Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood-Toluca Lake and the hill area south of Mulholland Drive in November 1971, choosing the first members himself from a range of backgrounds. He launched numerous studies of such councils in other cities and produced a booklet to help guide the new representative community groups in Los Angeles.\n\nOil drilling. In 1971 he proposed a ban on oil drilling on the city's coastline one-half mile inland from the shore \"for both esthetic and geographical safety reasons.\"\n\nIncome tax. He was a supporter of levying a city income tax in order to relieve property owners of a tax burden.\n\nRent control. He was a decided advocate for rent control in an effort to keep housing affordable for the elderly and the poor.\n\nGay rights. Wachs and Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson sponsored what Wachs called \"the strongest gay rights ordinance in the U.S.,\" prohibiting job and housing discrimination based on sexual preference. His measure outlawing employment discrimination against victims of AIDS was passed unanimously by the City Council, despite the fact that his mail on the subject was running heavily against it.\n\nRecycling. In 1981 he called for mandatory separation of recyclable materials from regular trash before collection to cope with the city's \"growing refuse-disposal crisis.\"\n\nArtists. Wachs successfully pushed for an ordinance change that would allow artists to live and work in commercially zoned districts. He also worked to create a city Cultural Affairs Department.\n\nDrug gear. Wachs cast the only vote against a city ordinance prohibiting minors from purchasing drug paraphernalia, saying in 1983 he did not think police officers should spend their time raiding head shops.\n\nOff leash. He proposed an eventually successful idea for the city to provide a number of dog parks, where Los Angeles' nearly 200,000 licensed dogs could run free.\n\nPolice chief. Wachs emerged as the sole City Council member who helped broker an agreement that enabled Police Chief Daryl Gates to resign his post in June 1992 and retire \"in an orderly fashion\" after a crisis occasioned by the March 1991 beating of Rodney King and the resulting riots—as well as the issuance of a final, critical report of the police department by the Christopher Commission. Wachs and Gates forged a bond of trust, it was said, when the councilman leaped to the chief's defense after the city Police Commission briefly removed Gates in the wake of the riots.\n\nDan White. Wachs went to Sacramento in January 1984 to unsuccessfully argue with state prison authorities that Dan White, the San Francisco supervisor who had killed gay leader Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, should be moved out of Los Angeles County, where he had been paroled after serving five years in prison for the killings.\n\nSports arena. Wachs was credited with forging a 1997 deal with the developers of a downtown sports arena that lifted some of the onerous provisions that would have worked to the financial disadvantage of the city. In return for the concessions, he agreed to exempt the arena from a ballot measure he was preparing to require voter approval for any subsidized sports stadiums.\n\nSlow-growth development Wach was an advocate for slow-growth development and was one of the cowriters of Proposition U, along with Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude.\n\nWachs resigned in 2001 to accept the presidency of Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. His last day on the City Council was September 28 of that year.\n\nWachs ran thrice for mayor of Los Angeles. In 1973, as a relatively unknown new city council member, he finished a distant seventh in a crowded primary election in which Tom Bradley eventually won his first Los Angeles mayoral election. In 1993, he finished third behind Richard Riordan and Mike Woo. He ran again in 2001 and finished fourth with 11 percent, behind James K. Hahn, Antonio Villaraigosa and Steve Soboroff.\n\nIn recognition of Wachs' involvement in promoting the arts, the City Council in 2002 named the intersection of Grand Avenue and Second Street as \"Joel Wachs Square.\" It lies between the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\n\nWachs was appointed vice chairman of a new National Task Force on the Arts, whose goal, he said, was \"to put the arts and culture on the agenda of every city government as a mainstream economic and social concern.\" Wachs said he spent one-third of his annual $43,923 salary (in 1981) on works of art for himself. In an interview, he told a reporter in 1981 that when the time came to leave the council, he could be happy practicing law, \"being a maitre d' in a nice restaurant,\" or \"heading an arts foundation.\" In 1987 he flew to New York City to be a part of a seven-member panel that tried to determine what to do with a 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long outdoor steel sculpture by Richard Serra titled \"Tilted Arc,\" which had drawn complaints and was eventually demolished.\n\nHe was the author of an ordinance that requires commercial developers to set aside 1% of the value of all projects costing more than $500,000 for cultural and artistic projects—either to spend the money on their own or deposit with the city for use elsewhere.\n\nWachs was active in strengthening Los Angeles' ordinance on outdoor advertising signs but was equally active when the city's Building and Safety Commission at first attempted to classify a proposed work by Barbara Kruger as a sign that fell under its jurisdiction. It later reversed itself and Wachs specifically compared the commission's initial decision to the prosecution of a Cincinnati museum over a show by the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nIn 2001, Wachs resigned his council seat and moved to New York City in order to serve as president of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Wachs is nominally the chairman of the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board. Wachs's salary at the charity is over $350,000 per year, which does not include generous expenses and a pension plan of approximately 20%. Although this is nearly four times the average salary for such a position, some have argued that the Warhol Foundation is unusually complex as well as being more influential than most similar organizations.\n\nIn 2010, Wachs—in his Warhol Foundation role—protested the removal of a David Wojnarowicz piece from the \"Hide/Seek\" exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery. The foundation had supported the exhibition with a $100,000 grant. Wachs wrote to the head of the Smithsonian Institution (NPG's parent organization), G. Wayne Clough, on behalf of the foundation's unanimous board with the \"demand that the Smithsonian restore the work ... to the exhibition or the foundation would reject any future grant requests.\" Wachs' letter said in part, \"For the arts to flourish, the arts must be free, and the decision to censor this important work is in stark opposition to our mission to defend freedom of expression wherever and whenever it is under attack.\" There were no signs of reinstatement of the Wojnarowicz piece by the NPG.\n\nHe had a boisterous personality. When he was newly elected to the Los Angeles City Council, he distributed a mock ordinance that would supposedly have taxed all male residents on the size of their genitals. Occasionally he would exclaim \"This is fun!\" in the middle of a committee meeting. His colleagues described him as \"a human guy, a lot of heart\" and used adjectives that ranged from \"very bright and intellectual\" to \"emotional\" to \"slightly hysterical.\"\n\nAccess to some of the \"Los Angeles Times\" links may require the use of a library card.\n\n"}

There are currently 38 primates of the Anglican Communion. The primates come together from the geographic provinces around the world for discussion and consultation. As \"primus inter pares\" of the communion, the Archbishop of Canterbury chairs the meetings, with the Secretary General of the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) serving as secretary. \n\n\"The Primates have no authority as a body and their own national churches determine how their ministry is carried out in their own context. The customs and responsibilities vary between provinces.\"\n\nThe Primates' Meeting was established by Donald Coggan, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1978 as an opportunity for “leisurely thought, prayer and deep consultation”. The first meeting was held in 1979.\n\nHeld from 2 to 9 March at the Kanuga Conference Center in the United States, topics of discussion included mission issues, poverty and debt concerns, \"Canons and Communion\", and the response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\nFollowing the regular primates meeting of May 2003, Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, convened an extraordinary meeting of the primates of the Anglican Communion from 15 to 16 October.\n\nThe primates gathered at Lambeth Palace in October for a series of closed meetings discussing a way forward because conflict over the Episcopal Church and the ordination of a gay bishop. The primates issued a communique at the close of the meeting.\n\nIn February 2005, Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting was held in Dromantine in Northern Ireland from 21 to 26 February. The issue of homosexuality was heavily discussed. Of the 38 primates, 35 attended. The primates issued a communiqué that reiterated most of the Windsor Report's statements, but added a new twist. The Episcopal Church (United States) and Anglican Church of Canada were asked to voluntarily withdraw from the Anglican Consultative Council, the main formal international entity within the Anglican Communion until the next Lambeth Conference in 2008.\n\nThe 2007 Primates' Meeting was held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from 15 to 19 February and reviewed a draft covenant for the Anglican Communion which is in part a response to disagreements between national churches on issues of sexuality and authority.\n\nThe 2011 Primates' Meeting was held in Dublin, Ireland. It was attended by the primates of only 23 of the 38 provinces of the Anglican Communion. A variety of reasons were offered for the absences. The Archbishop of the Congo was unable to obtain a visa. The primates of Mexico and Burma said that they were not well. Four primates cited other engagements: Kenya, North India, Sudan and Rwanda. The Archbishop of Tanzania offered “personal reasons” for his absence, while seven conservative primates boycotted the meeting as a protest against the attendance of the more liberal primates of the Episcopal Churches of the United States of America and of Canada: namely, the primates of the provinces of the Indian Ocean, Jerusalem and the Middle East, Nigeria, Uganda, Southeast Asia, the Province of the Southern Cone in South America and the Province of West Africa.\n\nMost of the primates gathered in Canterbury in January 2016. This followed the longest gap between meetings since they were established, during which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, had been visiting primates individually in their home countries following his installation in 2013. A communiqué was issued following the meeting. Its provisions included a \"the recommendation of a working group of our members\" that the U.S. Episcopal Church suspend its involvement in Anglican Communion \"decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or polity\" as a consequence for taking action in support of adopting policies of marriage inclusivity that coincided with the national law in the United States, and the announcement that the 15th Lambeth Conference would be called for 2020.\n\nHeld again in Canterbury, the 2017 meeting was attended by primates from 33 out of 39 provinces, with three unavailable due to local circumstances and three declining to attend due to disagreements with other members of the Anglican Communion. The GAFCON-affiliated Archbishop of Nigeria, Nicholas Okoh, cited \"broken fellowship over homosexual practice, same-sex marriage, and the blurring of gender identity\".\n\nA communiqué was issued, indicating that the focus of the meeting was \"in particular the challenge of sharing the love, compassion and reconciliation of Jesus with those in need around the world.\" It included discussions of safeguarding, to denote measures to protect the health, well-being and human rights of individuals, which allow people — especially children, young people and vulnerable adults — to live free from abuse, harm and neglect. The Primates also discussed approaches to sexuality and same-sex marriage, liturgy and pilgrimage, jurisdictional boundaries between member churches, war, and environmental and humanitarian issues. \n\nThe same terms which the U.S. Episcopal Church accepted in 2016 for its decision to adopt inclusive marriage policies without Anglican Communion consultation was applied to the Scottish Episcopal Church as a result of its own support for same-sex marriage. The result was that until 2020 the Scottish Church agreed that it will \"no longer represent the Communion on ecumenical and interfaith bodies; should not be appointed or elected to internal standing committees and that, while participating in the internal bodies of the Anglican Communion, they would not take part in decision making on any issues of doctrine or polity.\" \nFollowing a series of regional primates' meetings, Welby called a full Primates' Meeting in anticipation of the 2020 Lambeth Conference.\n\n\n\n"}

From the life insurance business, in Brooklyn, he soon turned to the study of natural history and illustration, he had sketched flowers and insects when he was only eight years old, had long been interested in botany and entomology, and had acquired great skill in making faux flowers. His first drawings, of a technical character, were published in 1870.\n\nHe rapidly became an expert illustrator and a remarkably able wood-engraver, while he also drew on stone with great success. He drew for \"The American Agriculturist\", \"Hearth and Home\", and Appletons \"American Cyclopaedia\"; for \"The Youth's Companion\" and \"St Nicholas\"; and then for various Harper publications, especially \"Harper's Monthly\" magazine, where his illustrations first gained popularity. He died of apoplexy, brought on by overwork at Washington, Connecticut, where he had had a summer studio, and where in a great boulder is inset a relief portrait of him by H. K. Bush-Brown. He was an expert photographer, and his drawings had a nearly photographic and almost microscopic accuracy of detail which slightly lessened their artistic value, as a poetic and sometimes humorous quality somewhat detracted from their scientific worth. Gibson was perfectly at home in black-and-white, but rarely (and feebly) used colors. He was a popular writer and lecturer on natural history.\n\nGibson illustrated S. A. Drake's In the \"Heart of the White Mountains\", C. D. Warner's \"New South\", and E. P. Roe's \"Nature's Serial Story\"; and his own books, \"The Complete American Trapper\" (1876; revised, 1880, as \"Camp Life in the Woods\"); \"Pastoral Days: or, Memories of a New England Year\" (1880); \"Highways and Byways\" (1882); \"Happy Hunting Grounds\" (1886); \"Strolls by Starlight and Sunshine\" (1890); \"Sharp Eyes: a Rambler's Calendar\" (1891); \"Our Edible Mushrooms and Toadstools \"(1895); \"Eye Spy: Afield with Nature among Flowers and Animate Things\" (1897); and \"My Studio Neighbours\" (1898).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2331441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331441", "title": "Arabic definite article", "text": "Arabic definite article\n\nUnlike most other Arabic particles, \"al-\" is always prefixed to another word and never stands alone. Consequently, many dictionaries do not list it, and it is almost invariably ignored in collation. \"Al-\" is not an intrinsic part of the word.\n\n\"Al-\" does not inflect for gender, plurality or grammatical case. The sound of the final -l consonant, however, can vary; when followed by a sun letter such as t, d, r, s, n and a few others, it assimilates to that sound, thus doubling it. For example: for \"the Nile\", one does not say \"al-Nīl\", but \"an-Nīl\". When followed by a moon letter, like m-, there is no assimilation: \"al-masjid\" (\"the mosque\"). This affects only the pronunciation and not the spelling of the article.\n\nTo put \"al\"- into perspective, there are many ways in which Arabic words can be made definite. These include the use of personal pronouns like \"me\", the use of proper nouns like \"Saudi Arabia\", demonstrative pronouns like \"this man\", relative pronouns like \"the man who ...\", vocation like \"O man\", possession like \"my man\", and of course the definite article like \"the man\". Apart from possession, prefixing a noun with \"al\"- is the weakest form of definiteness. That is, saying \"the man\" does not define the man being referred to as clearly as saying \"this man\", for example.\n\nArabic has an indefinite article indicated by nunation (\"\") which is declined for three cases.\n\nThe etymology of \"al\"- is the study of how it developed and how it changed over time. There are several major opinions in regards to the origins of the Arabic definite article. The earliest evidence of the article, besides a 1st-century BC inscription in Qaryat al-Faw (formerly Qaryat Dhat Kahil, near Sulayyil, Saudi Arabia), occurs in the 5th century BC, in the epithet of a goddess which Herodotus (\"Histories\" I: 131, III: 8) quotes in its preclassical Arabic form as \"Alilat\" (Ἀλιλάτ, i. e.,\"ʼal-ʼilat\"), which means \"the goddess\".\n\nWhile the Proto-Semitic language did not have any articles, the most likely theory is that the article \"al\"- comes from the same proto-Semitic source as the Hebrew definite article \"ha-\". That theory is based primarily on the fact that the two share many similarities. Both particles are prefixed to nouns, and both geminate with certain following letters. Moreover, neither particle is prefixed to non-final nouns in a genitival construction. Finally, both are prefixed to relative clauses. According to David Testen, many northern and southwestern Semitic languages have particles that bear similarities to \"al\"-. With this fact, he posits that \"al\"- has a proto-Semitic antecedent.\n\nThere are three major possibilities regarding the form of the proto-Semitic particle that is the putative antecedent of \"al\"-:\n\nDavid Testen and Jacob Weingreen state that / \"hal\" is the correct antecedent.\n\nOften cited is the Arabic word for 'this', \"hādhā\", which, when combined with a definite phrase, has been known to become shortened from \"hādhā al-bayt\" (this house) to \"hal-bayt\". However, \"hal-bayt \"may merely be a shortening of the demonstrative pronoun.\n\nWeingreen also states that the original form of the Hebrew \"ha-\" was in fact \"hal\". Hebrew, then, dropped the final \"l\" to achieve \"ha\"- while Arabic softened the \"h\"- to a hamza, resulting in \"al\"-. However, there is no evidence supporting the existence of \"hal\" from ancient Hebrew texts. In fact, as early as the 6th century BC both \"han\" (a probable predecessor of the Hebrew \"ha\") and \"al\" were being used simultaneously in different Arabic dialects, namely Northern and Central.\n\nThe Arabic word \"hādhā\" is equivalent to the Hebrew word זה \"zé\". It appears that over time Hebrew shortened the demonstrative pronoun hazé (\"eikh korím layéled hazé?\" or What's this boy's name?) to simply \"zé\". That indicates that the Hebrew \"ha-\" was the accurate retention of the original proto-Semitic source, as opposed to \"al-\", which cannot conclusively be linked to the ancient cognate demonstrative pronoun \"hādhā/hazé\".\n\nAccording to Jacob Barth, who was lecturer in Hebrew at the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary, \"al\"- comes directly from the Arabic negating particle, \"lā.\" He conjectures that \"lā\" became \"al\"- through a process of metathesis. That is to say, the lām and the alif swapped positions. It is noteworthy that the negation denoted by \"lā\" and the definiteness denoted by \"al\"- are in stark contrast to each other.\n\nBarth also asserts that \"lā\" could have resulted in \"al\"- through a process of syncope so the alif in \"lā\" and the vowel over the \"lām\" were dropped, resulting in a sukūn (an Arabic diacritic) over the \"lām\", and a volatile or elidable hamza was added to compensate for that.\n\nDavid Testen argues against both of these explanations. He says that there is no corroboratory evidence for either metathesis or syncope.\n\nIt is possible that \"al\"- comes from the same root as the asseverative-cum-precative particle, \"la-\"; it is the \"la-\" used at the beginning of nominal sentences for emphasis.\n\nThe phonology of \"al\"- is the study of its constituent letters and vowels, and of its pronunciation in different dialects and in different lexical circumstances.\n\nA classical (and largely one-sided) debate in regards to \"al\"- is whether the hamza is volatile or not. The majority opinion is that of Sibawayh (d. ca. 797), who considers the hamza volatile. In his opinion, the hamza neither is part of \"al\"- nor contributes to the definiteness of the following word.\n\nKhalīl, Ibn Keisān and Akhfash, on the other hand, consider the hamza not to be volatile. There is a further debate among the proponents of the second theory. Some do not consider the hamza volatile and assert that it contributes to the definiteness of the following word. Others assert that the hamza contributes to the definiteness of the following word but is still volatile.\n\nIn his defence, Khalīl argues that when a word prefixed with \"al\"- is preceded by the interrogative hamza, the two hamzas mix. For example, when the word \"al-āna\" (now) is prefixed with it, the result is \"āl-āna\". Clearly, the hamza of \"al\"- does not drop in this case even though there is no further purpose for it.\n\nKhalīl further argues that the only reason the hamza in \"al\"- is ever dropped is not that it is volatile but that it is used too much. When asked why the lām in \"al\"- was not simply given a vowel if it is so heavily used and it needs to be easier to pronounce, followers of Khalīl said that if the lām had been given a \"fatḥa\", it would have been confused with the asseverative-cum-precative particle. Had it been given a kasra, it would have been confused with the genitival particle. It could not have been given a ḍamma for fear of the following vowel being a kasra or ḍamma (which would result in awkward pronunciations as in *\"lu-ibil\" or *\"lu-‘unuq\").\n\nDespite the myriad of proofs for the argument, in most classical grammars and in modern Arabic, the opinion of Sibawayh is often taken as an axiomatic fact. There are many proofs and counterproofs, but the overarching argument in favour of this opinion is as follows:\n\nThe lām in \"al\"- is the only lām particle in the language with a sukūn (to avoid confusion, as mentioned). Thus, it requires a volatile hamza. Moreover, \"al\"- is a particle, and Arabic particles do not drop letters (without losing their meanings or connotations). Yet the hamza in \"al\"- drops all the time. Therefore, it must be volatile, or \"al\"- would lose its ability to render the following word definite.\n\nConsequently, it turns out that the hamza in \"al\"- is considered the only volatile hamza in the language that has a fatḥa vowel.\n\nIn very early Semitic languages, definiteness was achieved through gemination of the first letter in a word. For example, the word \"kitāb\" would be made definite by \"ak-kitāb\". An additional benefit of this construction was to connote \"determination\". The \"lām\" in the Arabic \"al\"- was thus a result of a dissimilation process.\n\nIn Arabic, this gemination occurs when the word to which \"al\"- is prefixed begins with one of the fourteen sun letters. Twelve of these letters (including lām) are originally designed to geminate. Ḍād and shīn have been included due to their similarities in pronunciation with lām and ţā, respectively. For example, the word \"\" 'the man' is actually pronounced \"\". Notice that the lām is written but not pronounced.\n\nIn more modern dialects, the sun letters have been extended to include the velars gīm and kāf.\n\nThe ancient people of Himyar replace the lām in \"al\"- with mīm. The Prophet Muhammad is recorded to have uttered the following words in that dialect:\n\nIn some Semitic languages like Hebrew, words that include the letter lāmed have Arabic cognates that replace it with a Mīm as opposed to Lām, the equivalent letter. For example, skull in Hebrew is גֻּלְגֹּלֶת (gulgolet). Its Arabic cognate is (). This gives plausibility to the case of Banu Hamīr and indicates that lām is frequently equated with Mīm.\n\nRegardless of whether the hamza in \"al\"- is volatile or not, it is read with a fatḥa when beginning speech with the definite article. For example, if one vocalizes the word 'the house' after a pause, it will be pronounced \"al-bayt\". In fact, the hamza in \"al\"- is largely considered to be the only volatile hamza that has a fatḥa vowel.\n\nIf, however, \"al\"- is vocalized in the middle of speech, the hamza will be dropped in pronunciation. As a result, the vowel preceding the definite article will be linked to the lām of \"al\"-. For example, (vocalized without any pauses) is pronounced \"bābu l-bayt\", is pronounced \"bāba l-bayt\", and is pronounced \"bābi l-bayt\".\n\nIf the word onto which \"al\"- is prefixed starts with a hamza, the vowel from that hamza may transfer to the lām of \"al\"- after which the hamza not be pronounced. See Allah in \"Arabic definite article\" for an example. If this hamza is volatile, that is required. An example is in the phrase \"bi’sa al-ismu\". The phrase is read as \"\"bi’sa lismu\"\" (Qur'an 49:11). The rule relates to hamza and is not in direct relation to \"al\"-. Moreover, it is a rare occurrence and is almost never applied in spoken varieties of modern or classical Arabic.\n\n\"Al\"- has been recorded to separate from its host word as in the following couplet:\n\nThe \"al\"- in has been recorded both with and without the alif. It has been stripped from its host word because of the meter of the couplet. It has then been repeated in the second half of the couplet reattached to its host. This happened very rarely and, even then, has been recorded only in poetry.\n\nThe primary and most profuse function of \"al\"- is to render the following word definite. This is known as . This function is of two types:\n\n\nThere is also a special type of known as \"the \"al\"- for ”. The noun on which the \"al\"- is prefixed, in this case, is never explicitly mentioned but the listener knows what is being referred to. For example, the word \"al-kitāb\" (the book) may actually refer to the classical book of Arabic grammar written by Sibawayh. Whenever grammarians talk about \"the book\", this is what they mean and it is always understood without explanation.\n\nOne of the functions of \"al\"- is to render the noun onto which it is prefixed a class noun (). For example, the word “al-asad” can mean ‘the lion’, referring to a specific lion, or ‘the lion’ in the sense ‘the lion is a dangerous animal’.\n\nNotice that the meaning connoted by this function of \"al\"- is indefinite, which is in stark contrast with the primary function of the definite article. Because of this meaning, the noun following \"al\"- will be grammatically indefinite and one may, for example, modify the noun without the use of a relative pronoun. An example of this is seen in the following couplet of poetry:\n\n\"Al\"- may be used to encompass all the individuals of a genus (). For example, “al-asad” can be used to mean ‘all lions’. This function is called . One is encouraged to use caution when employing this form of \"al\"- as it may be confused with its other meanings.\n\nIn order for \"al\"- to be in this capacity, it is necessary that it be interchangeable with the word \"kull\" 'all, every'. Some classical grammarians assert that this \"kull\" may be figurative, in which case \"al\"-, in this capacity, would be a form of exaggeration.\n\nThe most well known use of \"al\"- in this meaning occurs twice in the Qur'anic verse 1:1, (all praise is due to Allah, lord of all the worlds).\n\n\"Al\"- is often used in words to indicate the presence of something. For example, “al-yawm” means ‘this day’ i.e. ‘today’. In modern Arabic, this function is largely idiomatic and does not carry over to new words.\n\n\"Al\"- may be prefixed to names that are derived from Arabic nouns. This function is known as . The purpose of doing this is to point toward the meaning of the one named. For example, the name \"‘Adīl\" (meaning 'just') may be read \"\"al-‘Adīl\"\" to allude to the fact that ‘Adīl is a just person.\n\nIn modern Arabic, however, this type of \"al\"- is largely idiomatic. That is to say, names traditionally prefixed with \"al\"- are kept as such and names without \"al\"- are also kept as such; the connotation of this \"al\"- is ignored.\n\nWhen it comes to alphabetic ordering, some sources will list names according to the \"al\"- while others will ignore it.\n\n\"Al\"- is sometimes prefixed to words without giving any grammatical benefit. This may occur in poetry, in which case the purpose may be to maintain metre, rhythm, or rhyme.\n\nIt may also occur elsewhere to give a rhetorical benefit. For example, the \"al\"- attached to the relative pronoun \"al-ladhī\" (that/which/etc) is considered to be extra (), because relative pronouns are already definite and there is no use for the \"al\"-. \"Al\"- is perpetually and necessarily attached to this word in most Arabic dialects. Thus its purpose is not a lexical or grammatical one, but a rhetorical one.\n\nIn the above example, the extra \"al\"- is necessary. There are other cases where it is extra but not necessary. An example is in the following phrase:\n\nThe word “awwal” (first) is considered “ḥāl” (a type of object in grammar) in the above phrase. This type of object is typically indefinite according to most classical and modern grammarians. So the \"al\"- attached to it is unnecessarily extra.\n\n\n\"Al\"- is a particle (\"ḥarf\") in the Arabic language. Like most (but not all) particles, it is not prefixed to other particles. That is because particles are never in need of any of the lexical meanings or grammatical inflections provided by \"al\"-.\n\nSimilarly, \"al\"- is not prefixed to verbs. However, it has been seen on verbs in poetry, as in the following couplets by Dhu al-Kharq al-Tahawi (ذو الخرق الطهوي):\n\nSeveral opinions exist to explain this aberrant \"al\"-. The following is a precis of different Arabic scholars' views as given in \"Khizanat al-Adab\".\nOne view is that \"al\"- is a relative pronoun here, similar to \"alladhī\" (الذي), \"allatī\" (التي), etc. in Arabic. This is the view of Ibn Hisham and Al-Akhfash al-Akbar.\nThis opinion is in harmony with the form of the general relative pronoun (\"alli\", \"illi\", \"al\") in most Arabic dialects nowadays. If this view is correct, this aberrant \"al\"- does not follow the sun and moon letters rule.\n\n\"Al-\" may also be used to turn verbs in the imperfect, passive state into adjectives in a limited set of circumstances. This is employed to show ability/possibility, or with the use of another particle (\"-la-\"), inability/impossibility as is related to the definite word the resulting adjective modifies. Examples: \"Al-yurā\" : the see-able; \"al-yu'kal\" : the edible; \"al-\"la\"-yurā\" : the un-see-able; \"al-\"la\"-silkī\" : the wire-less [device]; etc.\n\nWhen \"al\"- occurs in places where we would not normally expect it, it is considered extra as far as grammar and lexicology are concerned. This is the view of al-Kisā’ī.\n\n\"Al\"- is used by poets to complete the meter of the verse under poetic license. This is the view of Ibn Malik, the author of the \"Alfiyyah\"; it is rejected by the author of the \"Khizānat al-Adab\".\n\nBecause nouns require the functions provided by \"al\"- (namely definiteness), \"al\"- is prefixed to them. \"Ism\", as defined in classical Arabic grammar, includes all parts of speech save particles and verbs: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc.\n\nAs a general rule, \"al\"- may be prefixed to any \"ism\", regardless of gender, plurality, grammatical case, etc. However, this rule has some pathological caveats. That is, there are some nouns that \"al\"- may never be prefixed to, and there are others that \"al\"- must always be prefixed to.\n\nThe definite article \"al\"- is not typically prefixed to nouns that do not inflect for definiteness. Examples include the interrogative \"man\" 'who'.\n\nThe definite article \"al\"- is not typically prefixed to nouns that are already definite. Examples include personal pronouns, relative pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, nouns already prefixed with \"al\"-, etc.\n\nExceptions to this include the prefixation of \"al\"- to the relative pronoun (see #Extra) and to proper nouns (see #At the beginning of names). As a concrete example, \"al\"- has been recorded at the beginning of a demonstrative pronoun, as in the following poetic verse:\n\n\"Al\"- is not prefixed to non-final nouns in a genitival construction (Iḍāfa). For example, in \"shawāri‘ al-madīna” (the city’s streets), the word is a non-final noun in the genitival construction. Hence, it cannot be prefixed with \"al\"- (it is already definite by virtue of the construction).\n\nExceptions to this include genitival constructions where the first noun is a participle and the second noun is its object. This can be done if one of the following conditions is met.\n\n\n\"Al\"- has also been seen in poetic verses prefixed to non-final nouns in a genitival construction. An example is in the following couplet:\n\nFurthermore, the grammatical school of Kufa allows \"al\"- on the first noun in a genitival construction if it is a number. For example, the phrase “thalāthat aqlām” (three pens) may be read “al-thalāthat aqlām”.\n\nAccording to the Basra school of classical grammar, \"al\"- does not typically follow the particles of vocation. For example, one will not say “yā ar-rajul” (O the man).\n\nThe proponents of the Basra camp give two exceptions.\n\nHowever, the Kufa camp of classical grammar, as well as many modern grammarians, allow \"al\"- to be prefixed to the object of vocation almost unconditionally. An example is given in the following couplet of poetry:\n\nUnder this scheme, if the object of vocation is a single word and it is feminine, the particle of vocation will be followed by the particle \"ayyatuhā\". And if it is masculine, it will be followed by the particle \"ayyuhā\".\n\nAccording to the classical grammarians Farrā and Kasā’ī, the overarching purpose of nunation is to differentiate between nouns and verbs. Thus a noun is given nunation so that it won’t be confused with a verb; for example the name would have been confused with a quadriliteral verb had it not been for nunation. Additionally, we know that \"al\"- is not prefixed to verbs. Therefore, when \"al\"- is prefixed to a noun, there is no longer any danger of the noun being confused with a verb, and so the nunation is no longer needed. Hence, no noun has both \"al\"- and nunation simultaneously.\n\nHowever, there are some types of nunation whose purpose is not to differentiate between nouns and verbs. Such types include (a type of nunation converted from an alif at the end of poetic couplets) and (a type of nunation used to maintain the metre of a poem).\n\nAn example of the first type in conjunction with \"al\"- is found in the following couplet of poetry:\n\nAnd an example of the second type in conjunction with \"al\"- is found in the verse below:\n\nThere are some nouns that are invariably seen with \"al\"-. Examples include the relative pronoun \"al-ladhī\" (that/which/etc).\n\n\"Al\"- may be prefixed to the first part of a number between 11 and 19. For example, \"aḥada ‘ashar\" (eleven) may be read as \"\"al-aḥada ‘ashar\"\".\n\nIn the case of a compound number (21-29, 31-39, ..., 91-99), \"al\"- may be prefixed to both parts. For example, \"wāḥid wa-‘ishrūn” (twenty-one) may be read as \"\"al-wāḥid wa-al-‘ishrūn\"\".\n\nWhen \"al\"- is prefixed to a participle, it acts like a relative pronoun. For the purposes of this rule, participles include (the active participle), (the passive participle), (another participle in Arabic), etc. For example, . This is translated as “I passed by the man who was riding his steed” as opposed to something like “I passed by the rider of his steed.” Consequently, all the rules of Arabic relative pronouns and their clauses will apply here.\n\nIt is widely accepted in Arabic grammar that a participle can carry tense. This tense, however, is typically limited to the present and future. But when we use the above construction, the past can be connoted by the participle as well due to the nature of relative clauses. For example, one may say (I passed by the man who was riding his steed yesterday).\n\nSome grammarians, however, say that it is only the past that can be connoted in this construction; the option of connoting the present and future is no longer available. And others say that no tense at all can be connoted.\n\n\"Al-\" has very few contributions to the grammatical case of a noun. However, it is worth mentioning that it turns second-declension nouns (\"ghayr munṣarif\") into first declension nouns by allowing the kasra vowel.\n\nMoreover, \"al\"- brings back the letter in an \"ism manqūṣ\" that is in the nominative or genitive case. Without the \"al\"-, the in such nouns is omitted and replaced by nunation.\n\nThe article was borrowed along with a large number of Arabic nouns into the Iberian Romance languages. (See Al-Andalus.) Portuguese, for example, acquired some 1,200 Arabic words between the 9th and 13th centuries, such as ' \"village\" (from \"alḍaiʿa\"), ' \"lettuce\" (from \"alxas\"), ' \"warehouse\" (from \"almaxzan\"), and ' \"olive oil\" (from \"azzait\"). It even appears on non-Arabic vocabulary, such as \"enxofre\" \"sulfur\" (also \"xofre\", from late classical Latin \"sulfur\"; the prefix nasalizes before \"x\").\nSpanish has a similar inventory, such as \"alfombra\" \"carpet\" and \"algodón\" \"cotton\", including such Arabic–Latinate doublets as \"aceituna\" and \"oliva\" \"olive\", \"alacrán\" and \"escorpión\" \"scorpion\", \"alcancía\" and \"hucha\" \"piggy bank\", as well as \"azufre ~ zufre\" \"sulfur\".\n\nWhether through the Iberian languages or by other routes, such as the technical vocabulary borrowed by various European languages during the adoption of Arab mathematics and science, a number of English words contain the Arabic definite article. These include \"alcove, alcohol, albatross, alfalfa, algebra, algorithm, alchemy, alkaline, alembic, elixir, artichoke, acequia, adobe, aniline, apricot, aubergine, azimuth,\" and the names of stars such as \"Algol\".\n\nIn \"azure\", from \"lāzūard\", the initial \"l\" of the word was lost due to being mistaken as the Arabic article; it is retained in \"lazurite\" and in the compound \"lapis lazuli\". In \"lute\", form \"\", the \"a\" of the article was dropped, but the \"l\" retained; compare \"oud\". In \"admiral\", the article comes at the end, as it is an abbreviation of such phrases as \"amīr-al-mā\" \"commander of the water\" and \"amīr-al-bahr\" \"commander of the sea\".\n\nThe al- article is also used in Urdu mostly relating to personal names of Arabic origin and in words which are imported from Arabic mostly related to religious, administrative and scientific vocabulary. The most common al- words in Urdu are () meaning \"exactly\" and () meaning \"currently\".\n\n\n"}

Kimmel of \"New England Movies Weekly\" writing, \"Woodley does solid work here as she's done elsewhere, and continues to be someone to watch.\" Despite a more negative critical reception than the previous film, \"Insurgent\" was commercially successful, making nearly $100 million in its worldwide debut and grossed $295.2 million worldwide. She reprised her role again in the penultimate film of the series \"\" (2016). The film, however, was poorly reviewed by critics and a box-office bomb. Lionsgate had planned for the final film in the series to be made for television, but Woodley announced that she would not be a part of it. She next starred opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Oliver Stone's biographical thriller \"Snowden\" (2016), in which Gordon-Levitt portrayed Edward Snowden. Owen Gleiberman's review said that Woodley \"gives a performance of breathtaking dimension: As the movie goes on, she makes Lindsay supportive and selfish, loving and stricken.\"\n\nStarting in 2015, Woodley took a break from filming for nearly a year, stating in a later interview that she \"had hit a wall with acting.\" From 2017 to 2019, Woodley starred as a sexual assault survivor, alongside Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, in two seasons of the HBO drama series \"Big Little Lies\". She was nominated for an Emmy and Golden Globe Award in 2017 for Best Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television respectively for her role. She also starred in and produced the biographical film \"Adrift\" (2018), with Baltasar Kormákur as director. Her performance as Tami Oldham Ashcraft, a real-life sailor who was stranded at sea after a storm, with Daniel Feingold from WSVN calling her work \"Oscar-worthy\". Woodley was awarded the Rising Star Award during the 2018 Deauville Film Festival.\n\nIn 2019, Woodley starred in the romantic drama \"Endings, Beginnings\" alongside Sebastian Stan, Jamie Dornan and Matthew Gray Gubler. She also joined the romantic drama film \"The Last Letter From Your Lover\", which began production in Mallorca, Spain and United Kingdom in mid-October 2019. Woodley will executive produce the film alongside co-star Felicity Jones. The film is directed by Augustine Frizzell. In November 2019, she joined the cast of real-life drama film \"Prisoner 760\". The film will star Jodie Foster, Tahar Rahim and Benedict Cumberbatch and began filming in South Africa on December 2, 2019. She was also cast in \"Girl Named Sue\", a film based on the true story of Sue Webber-Brown, a DEA agent who created the Drug Endangered Children (DEC) protocol. She will next star in \"Misanthrope\", an upcoming thriller centered on a talented but troubled cop who is recruited by the FBI to help profile and track down a serial killer. The film is set to be directed by Damián Szifron. Woodley will serve as a producer on the film. She joined Shia Lebeouf and Robert De Niro in the upcoming crime drama \"After Exile\", with Joshua Michael Stern as director. She is attached to star in animated feature \"Arkie\" and romance film \"No Baggage\", which are in pre-production and development respectively.\n\nIn 2018, Woodley confirmed she is dating Australian-Fijian rugby union player Ben Volavola. In an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Woodley mentioned that: \"I fall in love with human beings based on who they are, not based on what they do or what sex they are\". In a 2019, Woodley said: \"I don't trust anyone. Dating's hard. I mean, I love sex. I love the power of emotional connection via physicality. Who doesn't? ... But love is scary.\"\n\nIn April 2020 it was reported that the relationship with Volavola had ended.\n\nWhen asked in the past, Woodley repeatedly asserted that she did not consider herself a feminist: \"No, because I love men, and I think the idea of 'raise women to power, take the men away from the power' is never going to work out because you need balance...my biggest thing is really sisterhood more than feminism. I don't know how we as women expect men to respect us because we don't seem to respect each other.\" However, she did call herself a feminist in an interview with the \"New York Times\" in August 2017.\n\nWoodley is an avid environmental activist and climate advocate. She and her mother co-founded the All it Takes non-profit organization in 2010. All it Takes is a youth leadership program that aims to educate young people to practice empathy, compassion, responsibility, and purpose in hopes to foster sustainable, positive change for themselves, others and the environment. She supported Bernie Sanders for president in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, she protested against the Dakota Access Pipeline, an underground petroleum transport pipeline. In October, she was arrested for criminal trespassing in Saint Anthony, North Dakota. Woodley pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year of probation.\n\nIn mid-2016, Woodley joined the board of Our Revolution, a political organization aimed to educate voters about issues, get people involved in the political process, and work to organize and elect progressive leaders.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, Woodley was honored at the 20th Anniversary Global Green Environmental Awards receiving the Entertainment Industry Environmental Leadership Award for co-founding the All it Takes organization. In October 2016, she was given the Female EMA Futures Award during the 26th Annual Environmental Media Association (EMA) Awards.\n\nIn 2018, Woodley took activist Calina Lawrence to the 75th Golden Globe Awards as her guest; they first met at Standing Rock while protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\nIn July 2019, Woodley became an Oceans Ambassador for Greenpeace and embarked on a three-week-long expedition to the Sargasso Sea to study the impact of plastics and microplastics on marine life, and to document the importance of this unique ecosystem for protection under a new Global Ocean Treaty that is being negotiated at the UN.\n"}

{"id": "2331488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331488", "title": "Theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia", "text": "Theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia\n\nThe theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia claims that early Portuguese navigators were the first Europeans to sight Australia between 1521 and 1524, well before the arrival of Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606 on board the \"Duyfken\" who is generally considered to be the first European discoverer. This is based on the following elements:\nPrecedence of Australia's discovery has also been claimed for China (Admiral Zheng), France, Spain, and even Phoenicia.\n\nAlthough Scotsman Alexander Dalrymple wrote on this topic in 1786, it was R. H. Major, Keeper of Maps at the British Museum, who in 1859 first made significant efforts to prove the Portuguese discovered Australia before the Dutch. A group of mid-16th-century French maps, the Dieppe maps, formed his main evidence. However, there is widespread agreement today that his approach to historical research was flawed and his claims often exaggerated. Writing in an academic journal in 1861, Major announced the discovery of a map by Manuel Godinho de Eredia, claiming it proved a Portuguese discovery of North Western Australia, possibly dated to 1601. In fact, as W. A. R. Richardson points out, this map's origins are from 1630. On finally locating and examining Erédia's writings, Major realised the planned voyage to lands south of Sumba in Indonesia had never taken place. Major published a retraction in 1873, but his reputation was destroyed. Major's interpretation was examined critically by the Portuguese historian Joaquim Pedro de Oliveira Martins, who concluded that neither the \"patalie regiã\" on the 1521 world map of Antoine de La Sale nor the \"Jave la Grande\" on the Dieppe Maps was evidence of Australia having been discovered by Portuguese visitors in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, but that this feature had found its way on to the maps from descriptions of islands of the Sunda archipelago beyond Java collected from native informants by the Portuguese.\n\nIn 1895, George Collingridge produced his \"The Discovery of Australia\", an attempt to trace all European efforts to find the Great Southern Land to the time of Cook, and also introducing his interpretation of the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia, using the Dieppe maps. Fluent in Portuguese and Spanish, Collingridge was inspired by the publicity surrounding the arrival in Australia of copies of several Dieppe maps, which had been purchased by libraries in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. Despite a number of errors regarding place names, and \"untenable\" theories to explain misplacement on the Dieppe maps, his book was a remarkable effort considering it was written at a time when many maps and documents were inaccessible and document photography was still in its infancy. Collingridge's theory did not find public approval, however, and Professors G. Arnold Wood and Ernest Scott publicly criticised much of what he had written. Collingridge produced a shorter version of this book for use in New South Wales schools;\" The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea\". It was not used.\n\nProfessor Edward Heawood also provided early criticism of the theory. In 1899 he noted that the argument for the coasts of Australia having been reached early in the 16th century rested almost entirely on the supposition that at that time, \"a certain unknown map-maker drew a large land, with indications of definite knowledge of its coasts, in the quarter of the globe in which Australia is placed\". He pointed out that \"a difficulty arises from the necessity of supposing at least two separate voyages of discovery, one on each coast, though absolutely no record of any such exists\". He added: \"The difficulty, of course, has been to account for this map in any other way\". The delineation of Japan in the Dieppe maps, the insertion in them of an Isle des Géants in the southern Indian Ocean, and of Catigara on the west coast of South America, and in their later versions the depiction of a fictitious coastline of a southern continent with numerous bays and rivers, showed the slight reliance to be placed on them with respect to outlying parts of the world and the influence still exercised on their makers by the old writers\". He concluded: \"This should surely make us hesitate to base so important assumption as that of a discovery of Australia in the sixteenth century on their unsupported testimony\".\n\nThe development of the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia owes much to Melbourne lawyer Kenneth McIntyre's 1977 book, \"The Secret Discovery of Australia; Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook\". McIntyre's book was reprinted in an abridged paperback edition in 1982 and again in 1987 and it was found on school history reading lists by the mid-1980s. According to Dr. Tony Disney, McIntyre's theory influenced a generation of history teachers in Australian schools. A TV documentary was made of the book in the 1980s by Michael Thornhill and McIntyre and the theory featured in many positive newspaper reviews and articles over the next twenty years. Australian history school textbooks also reflect the evolution of acceptance of his theories. The support of Dr. Helen Wallis, Curator of Maps at the British Library during her visits to Australia in the 1980s seemed to add academic weight to McIntyre's theory. In 1987, the Australian Minister for Science, Barry Jones, launching the Second Mahogany Ship Symposium in Warrnambool, said \"I read Kenneth McIntyre's important book... as soon as it appeared in 1977. I found its central argument... persuasive, if not conclusive.\" The appearance of variant but essentially supporting theories in the late 1970s and early 1980s by other writers, including Ian McKiggan and Lawrence Fitzgerald also added credence to the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia. In 1994, McIntyre expressed pleasure that his theory was gaining acceptance in Australia: \"It is gradually seeping through. The important thing is that... it has been on the school syllabus, and therefore students have... read about it. They in due course become teachers and... they will then tell their students and so on\".\n\nThe central plank of the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia suggests the continent called Jave la Grande, which uniquely appears on a series of 16th-century French world maps, the Dieppe school of maps, represents Australia. Speaking in 1982, Kenneth McIntyre described the Dieppe maps as \"the only evidence of Portuguese discovery of Eastern Australia\". He stressed this to point out \"that the Mahogany Ship, and the Geelong Keys, and other things of that sort, are not part of the proof that the Portuguese discovered Australia. It is the other way around. The Dieppe maps prove (sic) that the Portuguese discovered Australia, and this throws a fierce bright light on our mysteries such as the Mahogany Ship\". Later writers on the same topic take the same approach of concentrating primarily on \"Jave la Grande\" as it appears in the Dieppe maps, including Fitzgerald, McKiggan and most recently, Peter Trickett.\nCritics of the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia, including A. Ariel, M. Pearson, W. A. R. Richardson, Gayle K. Brunelle and Robert J. King also concentrate on the \"Jave la Grande\" landmass of the Dieppe maps (see below).\n\nW. A. R. Richardson argues that Jave la Grande as it appears on the Dieppe world maps is at least partly based on Portuguese sources that no longer exist. McIntyre attributed discrepancies between the Jave la Grande coastline and Australia's to the difficulties of accurately recording positions without a reliable method of determining longitude, and the techniques used to convert maps to different projections.\n\nIn the late 1970s, mathematician Ian McKiggan developed his theory of exponential longitude error theory to explain discrepancies, although he modified this position after a public exchange of opinion with W. A. R. Richardson. McIntyre's own theory about distortion of the maps and the calculations used to correct the maps has also been challenged. Both Lawrence Fitzgerald and Peter Trickett argue Jave la Grande is based on Portuguese sea charts, now lost, which the mapmakers of Dieppe misaligned. Both these writers try to compare the coastal features of Jave la Grande with modern Australia's, by realigning them.\n\nIn 1994, McIntyre suggested that the writings of Pedro Nunes supported his interpretation of the distortion that occurred on the Dieppe Maps.\n\nHelen Wallis, Keeper of Maps at the British Museum, referred in 1988 to the interpretation \"explosion\" on the subject of the Dieppe maps. She herself argued the case for discovery of Australia by \"a local Portuguese voyage otherwise unknown\" seventy years before the Dutch, a chart of which was \"presumably\" brought back to Dieppe by the survivors of a French voyage to Sumatra led by Jean Parmentier in 1529–30.\n\nCristóvão de Mendonça is known from a small number of Portuguese sources, notably the famous Portuguese historian João de Barros in \"Décadas da Ásia\" (Decades of Asia), a history of the growth of the Portuguese Empire in India and Asia, published between 1552–1615. Mendonça appears in Barros' account with instructions to search for the legendary Isles of Gold. However, Mendonça and other Portuguese sailors are then described as assisting with the construction of a fort at Pedir (Sumatra) and Barros does not mention the expedition again.\n\nMcIntyre nominated Cristóvão de Mendonça as the commander of a voyage to Australia c. 1521–1524, one he argued had to be kept secret because of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which divided the undiscovered world into two-halves for Portugal and Spain. Barros and other Portuguese sources do not mention a discovery of land that could be Australia, but McIntyre conjectured this was because original documents were lost in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, or the official policy of silence.\n\nMost proponents of the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia have supported McIntyre's hypothesis that it was Mendonça who sailed down the eastern Australian coast and provided charts which found their way onto the Dieppe maps, to be included as \"Jave la Grande\" in the 1540, 1550s and 1560s. McIntyre claimed the maps indicated Mendonça went as far south as Port Fairy, Victoria; Fitzgerald claims they show he went as far as Tasmania; Trickett states as far as Spencer Gulf in South Australia, and New Zealand's North Island.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, German-born linguist Dr. Carl-Georg von Brandenstein, approaching the theory from another perspective, claimed that 60 words used by Aboriginal people of the Australian north-west had Portuguese origins. According to University of Adelaide Professor Peter Mühlhäusler:\n\nVon Brandenstein also claimed the Portuguese had established a \"secret colony...and cut a road as far as the present day town of Broome\" and that \"stone housing in the east Kimberley could not have been made without outside influence\". However, according to Dr. Nick Thieberger, modern linguistic and archaeological research has not corroborated his arguments. Mühlhäusler agrees, stating that \"von Brandenstein's evidence is quite unconvincing: his historical data is speculative – the colonisation being clandestine, there are no written records of it and his claims are not supported by the linguistic evidence he cites.\"\n\nIn contemporary Australia, reports of textual and cartographic evidence, of varying significance, and occasionally artifacts are sometimes cited as likely to \"rewrite\" Australian History because they suggest a foreign presence in Australia. In January 2014, a New York Gallery listed a sixteenth-century Portuguese manuscript for sale, one page of which contained marginalia of an unidentified animal that the Gallery suggested might be a kangaroo. Dr. Martin Woods of the National Library of Australia commented: \"The likeness of the animal to a kangaroo or wallaby is clear enough, but then it could be another animal in south-east Asia, like any number of deer species... For now, unfortunately the appearance of a long-eared big-footed animal in a manuscript doesn't really add much.\" Dr. Peter Pridmore of La Trobe University has suggested the marginalia depicts an aardvark.\n\nOther texts originating from the same era represent a land to the south of New Guinea, with a variety of flora and fauna. Part of a map in Cornelis de Jode's 1593 atlas \"Speculum Orbis Terrae\" depicts New Guinea and a hypothetical land to the south inhabited by dragons. Kenneth McIntyre suggested that although Cornelis de Jode was Dutch, the title page of \"Speculum Orbis Terrae\" may provide evidence of early Portuguese knowledge of Australia. The page depicts four animals: a horse, representing Europe, a camel, to represent Asia, a lion, for Africa, and another animal that resembles a kangaroo, to represent a fourth continent. The latter creature features a marsupial pouch containing two offspring, and the characteristically bent hind legs of a kangaroo or another member of the macropod family. However, as macropods are found in New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago (these include the dusky pademelon, agile wallaby, and black dorcopsis), this may have no relevance to a possible Portuguese discovery of Australia. Another explanation is that the animal is based on a North American opossum.\n\nOn 11 June 1770, James Cook's \"Endeavour\" struck a coral reef (now known as Endeavour Reef) off the coast of what is now Queensland. It was a potentially catastrophic event and the ship immediately began to take water. However, over the next four days the ship managed to limp along, searching for safety. In 1976, McIntyre suggested that Cook had been able to find a large harbour (Cooktown harbour) because he had access to a copy of one of the Dieppe maps. McIntyre felt Cook's comment in his Journal, which at the 1982 \"Mahogany ship Symposium\" he cited as \"this harbour will do excellently for our purposes, although it's not as large as I had been told\", indicated he carried a copy of or had seen a copy of the Dauphin Map, and by implication was using it to chart his way along the eastern Australian coast. McIntyre acknowledged in his book that Cook may have been told this by the lookout or boat crew, but added it was a \"peculiar remark to make.\" Reference to this remained in subsequent editions of \"The Secret Discovery of Australia.\"\n\nIn 1997, Ray Parkin edited a definitive account of Cook's voyage of 1768–1771, transcribing the \"Endeavour's\" original log, Cook's Journal and accounts by other members of the crew. Parkin transcribed the relevant Journal entry as \"...anchored in 4 fathom about a mile from the shore and then made a signal for the boats to come onboard, after which I went myself and buoy’d the channel which I found very narrow and the harbour much smaller than I had been told but very convenient for our purpose.\" The log for 14 June also mentions the ship's boats sounding the way for the crippled \"Endeavour\". Nevertheless, the influence of McIntyre's interpretation can still be seen in contemporary Australian school curriculum materials.\n\nAccording to McIntyre, the remains of one of Cristóvão de Mendonça's caravels was discovered in 1836 by a group of shipwrecked whalers while walking along the sand dunes to the nearest settlement, Port Fairy. The men came across the wreck of a ship made of wood that appeared to be mahogany. Between 1836 and 1880, 40 people recorded that they had seen an \"ancient\" or \"Spanish\" wreck. Whatever it was, the wreck has not been seen since 1880 despite extensive searches in recent times. McIntyre's accuracy in transcribing original documents to support his argument has been criticized by some recent writers. Dr. Murray Johns' 2005 survey of 19th-century accounts of the Mahogany Ship suggests the eyewitness accounts actually relate to more than one shipwreck in the area. Johns concludes these wrecks were of early 19th-century Australian construction and are unrelated to Portuguese maritime activity.\n\nIn 1847, at Limeburners Point, near Geelong, Victoria, Charles La Trobe, a keen amateur geologist, was examining shells and other marine deposits revealed by excavations associated with lime production in the area. A worker showed him a set of five keys he claimed to have found the day before. La Trobe concluded that the keys had been dropped onto what had been the beach around 100–150 years before. Kenneth McIntyre hypothesised they were dropped in 1522 by Mendonça or one of his sailors. Since the keys have been lost, however, their origin cannot be verified.\n\nA more likely explanation is that the keys were dropped by one of the limeburners shortly before being found, as the layer of dirt and shells they were found below was dated as around 2300–2800 years old, making La Trobe's dating implausible. According to geologist Edmund Gill, and engineer and historian Peter Alsop, the error by La Trobe is quite understandable, given that in 1847 most Europeans thought the world was only 6000 years old.\n\nIn 1916, two bronze cannon were found on a small island in Napier Broome Bay, on the Kimberly coast of Western Australia. Since the guns were erroneously thought to be carronades, the small island was named Carronade Island.\n\nKenneth McIntyre believed the cannons gave weight to the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia. However, scientists at the Western Australian Museum in Fremantle made a detailed analysis of the weapons, and determined that they are swivel guns, and almost certainly of late 18th-century Makassan, rather than European, origin. The claim that one of the guns displays a Portuguese \"coat of arms\" is incorrect.\n\nIn January 2012, a swivel gun found two years before at Dundee Beach near Darwin was widely reported by web news sources and the Australian press to be of Portuguese origin. However, initial analysis by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory indicated it was probably also of Southeast Asian origin. The museum holds seven guns of Southeast Asian manufacture in its collection. Another swivel gun of Southeast Asian manufacture, found in Darwin in 1908, is held by the Museum of South Australia. In 2014, it was revealed that sand inside the Dundee beach gun was dated to 1750. Further analysis suggested that the lead in the gun most closely resembled that from Andalusia in Spain, although it might have been recycled in Indonesia.\n\nKenneth McIntyre first suggested in 1977 that the stone ruins at Bittangabee Bay, in Ben Boyd National Park near Eden on the south coast of New South Wales, were of Portuguese origin.\n\nThe ruins are the foundations of a building, surrounded by stone rubble that McIntyre argued may have once formed a defensive wall. McIntyre also identified the date 15?4 carved into a stone. McIntyre hypothesized the crew of a Portuguese caravel may have built a stone blockhouse and defensive wall while wintering on a voyage of discovery down Australia's east coast.\n\nSince McIntyre advanced his theory in 1977, significant research on the site has been conducted by Michael Pearson, former Historian for the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service. Pearson identified the Bittangabee Bay ruins as having been built as a store house by the Imlay brothers, early European inhabitants, who had whaling and pastoral interests in the Eden area. The local Protector of Aborigines, George Augustus Robinson, wrote about the commencement of the building in July 1844. The building was left unfinished at the time of the death of two of the three brothers in 1846 and 1847.\n\nOther visitors and writers including Lawrence Fitzgerald have been unable to find the 15?4 date. Writing in \"Beyond Capricorn\" in 2007, Peter Trickett suggests the date McIntyre saw may be random pick marks in the stonework.\n\nTrickett accepts Pearson's work, but hypothesizes the Imlays may have started their building on top of a ruined Portuguese structure, thus explaining the surrounding rocks and partly dressed stones. Trickett also suggests the Indigenous Australian name for the area may have Portuguese origins.\n\nFive coins from the Kilwa Sultanate were found on Marchinbar Island in 1945 by RAAF radar operator Morry Isenberg. In 2018 another coin, also thought to be from Kilwa, was found on a beach on Elcho Island, another of the Wessel Islands, by archaeologist and member of the Past Masters group, Mike Hermes. Hermes speculated that this may indicate trade between indigenous Australians and Kilwa, or that they coins had arrived as a result of Makassan contact with Australia. Mike Owen, another member of the group, speculated that this may indicate the Portuguese visited the Wessel Islands sometime after they had installed Muhammad Arcone on the Kilwa throne as a Portuguese vassal, from 1505 to 1506.\n\nPossibly because of the degree of conjecture involved in the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia, there have been a number of critics. Matthew Flinders cast a sceptical eye over the \"Great Java\" of the Dieppe maps in \"A Voyage to Terra Australis,\" published in 1814, and concluded: \"it should appear to have been partly formed from vague information, collected, probably, by the early Portuguese navigators, from the eastern nations; and that conjecture has done the rest. It may, at the same time, be admitted, that a part of the west and north-west coasts, where the coincidence of form is most striking, might have been seen by the Portuguese themselves, before the year 1540, in their voyages to, and from, India\".\n\nIn the last chapter of \"The Secret Discovery of Australia,\" Kenneth McIntyre threw down a challenge, stating: \"Every critic who seeks to deny the Portuguese discovery of Australia is faced with the problem of providing an alternative theory to explain away the existence of the Dieppe maps. If the Dauphin is not the record of real exploration, then what is it?\"\n\nBy far the most prolific writer on this theory, and also its most consistent critic, has been Flinders University Associate Professor W.A.R (Bill) Richardson, who has written 20 articles relating to the topic since 1983. As Richardson, an academic fluent in Portuguese and Spanish, first approached the Dieppe maps in an effort to prove they did relate to Portuguese discovery of Australia, his criticisms are all the more interesting. He suggests he quickly realised there was no connection between the Dieppe maps and modern Australia's coastline:\nThe case for an early Portuguese discovery of Australia rests entirely on imagined resemblances between the \"continent\" of Jave La Grande on the Dieppe maps and Australia. There are no surviving Portuguese 16th-century charts showing any trace of land in that area, and there are no records whatsoever of any voyage along any part of the Australian coastline before 1606. Advocates of the Portuguese discovery theory endeavour to explain away this ... embarrassing lack of direct supporting evidence as being due to two factors: the Portuguese official secrets policy, which must have been applied with a degree of efficiency that is hard to credit, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake which, they claim, must have destroyed all the relevant archival material.\nHe dismisses the claim that Cristóvão de Mendonça sailed down the east coast of Australia as sheer speculation, based on voyages about which no details have survived. In the same way, the re-assembling of sections of the \"Jave La Grande\" coastline so that it fits the straitjacket of the real outline of Australia relies upon a second set of assumptions. He argues taking that approach, \"Jave La Grande\" could be re-assembled to look like anything.\n\nAnother dimension of the argument Richardson advances against the theory relates to methodology. Richardson argues McIntyre's practice of re-drawing sections of maps in his book was misleading because in an effort to clarify he actually omitted crucial features and names that did not support the Portuguese discovery theory.\n\nRichardson's own view is that a study of placenames (toponymy) on \"Jave La Grande\" identifies it as unmistakably connected to the coasts of southern Java and Indochina. Emeritus Professor Victor Prescott has claimed Richardson \"brilliantly demolished the argument that Java la Grande show(s) the east coast of Australia.\" However, Australian historian Alan Frost has recently written that Richardson's argument that the east coast of Java la Grande was in fact the coast of Vietnam is \"so speculative and convoluted as not to be credible\".\n\nIn 1984, criticism of \"The Secret Discovery of Australia\" also came from master mariner Captain A. Ariel, who argued McIntyre had made serious errors in his explanation and measurement of \"erration\" in longitude. Ariel concluded that McIntyre erred on \"all navigational ... counts\" and that \"The Secret Discovery of Australia\" was a \"monumental piece of misinterpretation.\"\n\nFrench cartographic historian Sarah Toulouse concluded in 1998 that it seemed most reasonable to see in \"la Grande Jave\", in the present state of the available sources, the pure product of imagination of a Norman cartographer who formed a school with his compatriots.\n\nIn 2005, historian Michael Pearson made the following comment on the Dieppe maps as evidence of a Portuguese discovery of Australia:\nIf the Portuguese did in fact map the northern, western and eastern coasts, this information was hidden from general knowledge ... The Dieppe maps had no claimed sources, no \"discoverer\" of the land shown ... and the iconography on the various maps is based on Sumatran animals and ethnography, not the reality of Australia. In this sense the maps did not really expand European knowledge of Australia, the portrayal of \"Jave La Grande\" having no greater status that any other conjectural portrayal of Terra Australis.\n\nIn a recent interpretation of the Dieppe maps, Professor Gayle K. Brunelle of California State University, Fullerton argued that the Dieppe school of cartographers should be seen as acting as propagandists for French geographic knowledge and territorial claims. The decades from about 1535 to 1562 when the Dieppe school of cartographers flourished were also the period in which French trade with the New World was at its 16th-century height, in terms of the North Atlantic fish trade, the fur trade, and, most important for the cartographers, the rivalry with the Portuguese for control of the coasts of Brazil and the supplies of lucrative brazilwood. The bright red dye produced from brazilwood replaced woad as the primary dyestuff in the cloth industry in France and the Low Countries. The Dieppe cartographers used the skills and geographic knowledge of Portuguese mariners, pilots and geographers working in France to produce maps meant to emphasize French interests in and dominion over territory in the New World that the Portuguese also claimed, both in Newfoundland and in Brazil. Brunelle noted that, in design and decorative style the Dieppe maps represented a blending of the latest knowledge circulating in Europe with older visions of world geography deriving from Ptolemy and mediaeval cartographers and explorers such as Marco Polo. Renaissance mapmakers such as those based in Dieppe relied heavily on each other's work, as well as on maps from previous generations, and thus their maps represented a mixture of old and new information often coexisting uneasily in the same map.\n\nRobert J. King has also argued that Jave la Grande on the Dieppe maps is a theoretical construction, reflecting 16th-century views of cosmography. In an article written in 2009, he pointed out that the geographers and map makers of the Renaissance struggled to bridge the gap from the world-view inherited from Graeco-Roman antiquity, as set out in Claudius Ptolemy's \"Geography\", and a map of the world that would take account of the new geographical information obtained during the Age of Discoveries. The Dieppe world maps reflected the state of geographical knowledge of their time, both actual and theoretical. Accordingly, Java Major, or \"Jave la Grande\", was shown as a promontory of the undiscovered antarctic continent of Terra Australis. This reflected a misunderstanding of where Marco Polo had located Java Minor and confusion regarding the relative positions of parts of East and Southeast Asia and America. In an argument similar to Brunelle's, King suggests that Jave la Grande on the Dieppe maps represents one of Marco Polo's pair of Javas (Major or Minor), misplaced far to the south of its actual location and attached to a greatly enlarged Terra Australis. He believes it does not represent Australia discovered by unknown Portuguese voyagers. In a subsequent article, he argues that the Dieppe mapmakers identified Java Major (\"Jave la Grande\") or, in the case of Guillaume Brouscon Locach (\"Terre de lucac\"), with Oronce Fine's Regio Patalis. In 2010, King received the Australasian Hydrographic Society's Literary Achievement Award for 2010 in recognition of his work on the origins of the Dieppe Maps.\n\nAcademic debate about the Dieppe maps continues into the twenty-first century. In 2019, Professor Brian Lees and Associate Professor Shawn Laffan presented a paper arguing the Jean Rotz 1542 world map is a good \"first approximation\" of the Australian continent.\n\n\n\n"}

He received his early education (1846-1851) studying under Christian Daniel Rauch and Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann. During a period of study in Italy, from 1856 to 1858, he was influenced by Arnold Böcklin and Franz von Lenbach in the direction of a naturalistic style in sculpture. This tendency was marked in the group \"Borussia\", executed for the facade of the exchange in Berlin, which first brought him into general notice. \n\nIn 1861 Begas was appointed professor at the art school at Weimar, but retained the appointment only a few months. That he was chosen, after competition, to execute the statue of Friedrich Schiller for the Gendarmenmarkt in Berlin, was a high tribute to the fame he had already acquired, and the result, one of the finest statues in the German metropolis, entirely justified his selection. Since the year 1870, Begas dominated the plastic art in the Kingdom of Prussia, but especially in Berlin. Among his chief works during this period are the colossal statue of Borussia for the Hall of Glory; the Neptune fountain in bronze on the Schlossplatz; the statue of Alexander von Humboldt, and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Nationaldenkmal, all in Berlin; the sarcophagus of Emperor Frederick III in the mausoleum of the Church of Peace at Potsdam; and, lastly, the national monument to Emperor William I, the statue of Otto von Bismarck before the Reichstag building, and several of the statues in the Siegesallee. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2331525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331525", "title": "Hydroboration", "text": "Hydroboration\n\nIn chemistry, hydroboration refers to the addition of a hydrogen-boron bond to C-C, C-N, and C-O double bonds, as well as C-C triple bonds. This chemical reaction is useful in the organic synthesis of organic compounds. The development of this technology and the underlying concepts were recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Herbert C. Brown. He shared the Nobel prize in chemistry with Georg Wittig in 1979 for his pioneering research on organoboranes as important synthetic intermediates.\n\nHydroboration produces organoborane compounds that react with a variety of reagents to produce useful compounds, such as alcohols, amines, alkyl halides. The most widely known reaction of the organoboranes is oxidation to produce alcohols typically by hydrogen peroxide. This type of reaction has promoted research on hydroboration because of its mild condition and a wide scope of tolerated alkenes. Another research subtheme is metal-catalysed hydroboration.\n\nHydroboration is typically anti-Markovnikov, i.e. the hydrogen adds to the most substituted carbon of the double bond. That the regiochemistry is reverse of a typical HX addition reflects the polarity of the B-H bonds. Hydroboration proceeds via a four-membered transition state: the hydrogen and the boron atoms added on the same face of the double bond. Granted that the mechanism is concerted, the formation of the C-B bond proceeds slightly faster than the formation of the C-H bond. As a result, in the transition state, boron develops a partially negative charge while the more substituted carbon bears a partially positive charge. This partial positive charge is better supported by the more substituted carbon. Formally, the reaction is an example of a group transfer reaction. However, an analysis of the orbitals involved reveals that the reaction is 'pseudopericyclic' and not subject to the Woodward–Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactivity. \n\nIf BH is used as the hydroborating reagent, reactions typically proceed beyond the monoalkyl borane compounds, especially for less sterically hindered small olefins. Trisubstituted olefins can rapidly produce dialkyl boranes, but further alkylation of the organoboranes is slowed because of steric hindrance. This significant rate difference in producing di- and tri-alkyl boranes is useful in the synthesis of bulky boranes that can enhance regioselectivity (see below).\n\nFor trisubstituted alkenes such as 1, boron is predominantly placed on the less substituted carbon. The minor product, in which the boron atom is placed on the more substituted carbon, is usually produced in less than 10%. A notable case with lower regioselectivity is styrene, and the selectivity is strongly influenced by the substituent on the para position.\n\nHydroboration of 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, such as a \"cis\" or \"trans\" olefin, produces generally a mixture of the two organoboranes of comparable amounts, even if the substituents are very different in terms of steric bulk. For such 1,2-disubstituted olefins, regioselectivity can be observed only when one of the two substituents is a phenyl ring. In such cases, such as \"trans\"-1-phenylpropene, the boron atom is placed on the carbon adjacent to the phenyl ring. The observations above indicate that the addition of H-B bond to olefins is under electronic control rather than steric control.\n\nThe C-B bonds generated by hydroboration are reactive with various reagents, the most common one being hydrogen peroxide. Because the addition of H-B to olefins is stereospecific, this oxidation reaction will be diastereoselective when the alkene is tri-substituted. Hydroboration-oxidation is thus an excellent way of producing alcohols in a stereospecific and anti-Markovnikov fashion.\n\nHydroboration can also lead to amines by treating the intermediate organoboranes with monochloramine or O-hydroxylaminesulfonic acid (HSA).\n\nTerminal olefins are converted to the corresponding alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides by treating the organoborane intermediates with bromine or iodine. Such reactions have not however proven very popular, because succinimide-based reagents such as NIS and NBS are more versatile and do not require rigorous conditions as do organoboranes.\netc.\n\nDiborane can be produced in situ by reduction BF with NaBH (see for Flavopiridol). Usually however, borane dimethylsulfide complex BHS(CH) (BMS) is used as a source of BH. It can be obtained in highly concentrated forms. \n\nThe adduct BH(THF) is also commercially available as THF solutions wherein it exists as the 1:1 adduct. It degrades with time. \n\nBorane adducts with phosphines and amines are also available, but are not widely used. Borane makes a strong adduct with triethylamine; using this adduct requires harsher conditions in hydroboration. This can be advantageous for cases such as hydroborating trienes to avoid polymerization. More sterically hindered tertiary and silyl amines can deliver borane to alkenes at room temperature.\nMonoalkyl boranes are relatively rare. They exist as dimers of the form [RBH]. One example is thexylborane (ThxBH), produced by the hydroboration of tetramethylethylene:\nA chiral example is monoisopinocampheylborane. Although often written as IpcBH, it is a dimer [IpcBH]. It is obtained by hydroboration of (−)‐α‐pinene with borane‐dimethyl sulfide.\n\nSpecies of the form RBH are available for R = alkyl and halide. Monobromo- and monochloro-borane can be prepared from BMS and the corresponding boron trihalides. The stable complex of monochloroborane and 1,4-dioxane is a superior for selective hydroboration of terminal alkenes.\n\nDisubstituted boranes have the formula (RBH), although they are often described as RBH, an example being dimesitylborane (MesBH, or (CHMe)BH). Sterically bulky boranes are slow to undergo hydroboration. For example dimesitylborane react very slowly with simple terminal alkenes. On the other hand, alkynes undergo monohydroboration with MesBH easily to produce alkenylboranes.\n\nAmong hindered dialkylboranes, disiamylborane (abbreviated SiaBH, but is a dimer [SiaBH]) is well known for selective hydroboration of less hindered, usually terminal alkenes in the presence of more substituted alkenes. Disiamylborane must be freshly prepared as its solutions can only be stored at 0 °C for a few hours. Dicyclohexylborane ChxBH exhibits improved thermal stability than SiaBH.\n\nA versatile dialkylborane is 9-BBN (or \"banana borane\"). It exists as a dimer. It can be distilled without decomposition at 195 °C (12mm Hg). Reactions with 9-BBN typically occur at 60–80 °C, with most alkenes reacting within one hour. Tetrasubstituted alkenes add 9-BBN at elevated temperature. As mentioned above, hydroboration of alkenes with 9-BBN proceeds with excellent regioselectivity. It is more sensitive to subtle steric differences than SiaBH, perhaps because of the rigid backbone. 9-BBN is more reactive towards alkenes than alkynes.\n\nSimple, unhindered dialkylboranes are reactive at room temperature towards most alkenes and terminal alkynes but are difficult to prepare in high purity, since they exist in equilibrium with mono- and trialkylboranes. One common way of preparing them is the reduction of dialkylhalogenoboranes with metal hydrides. An important synthetic application using such dialkylboranes, such as diethylborane, is the transmetallation of the organoboron compounds to form organozinc compounds.\n\nFor catalytic hydroboration, pinacolborane and catecholborane are widely used. They also exhibit higher reactivity toward alkynes. Pinacolborane is also widely used in a catalyst-free hydroborations.\n\n"}

The effect of such fields on molecules and solids can be studied with TDDFT to extract features like excitation energies, frequency-dependent response properties, and photoabsorption spectra.\n\nTDDFT is an extension of density-functional theory (DFT), and the conceptual and computational foundations are analogous – to show that the (time-dependent) wave function is equivalent to the (time-dependent) electronic density, and then to derive the effective potential of a fictitious non-interacting system which returns the same density as any given interacting system. The issue of constructing such a system is more complex for TDDFT, most notably because the time-dependent effective potential at any given instant depends on the value of the density at all previous times. Consequently, the development of time-dependent approximations for the implementation of TDDFT is behind that of DFT, with applications routinely ignoring this memory requirement.\n\nThe formal foundation of TDDFT is the Runge-Gross (RG) theorem (1984) – the time-dependent analogue of the Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem (1964). The RG theorem shows that, for a given initial wavefunction, there is a unique mapping between the time-dependent external potential of a system and its time-dependent density. This implies that the many-body wavefunction, depending upon 3\"N\" variables, is equivalent to the density, which depends upon only 3, and that all properties of a system can thus be determined from knowledge of the density alone. Unlike in DFT, there is no general minimization principle in time-dependent quantum mechanics. Consequently, the proof of the RG theorem is more involved than the HK theorem.\n\nGiven the RG theorem, the next step in developing a computationally useful method is to determine the fictitious non-interacting system which has the same density as the physical (interacting) system of interest. As in DFT, this is called the (time-dependent) Kohn-Sham system. This system is formally found as the stationary point of an action functional defined in the Keldysh formalism.\n\nThe most popular application of TDDFT is in the calculation of the energies of excited states of isolated systems and, less commonly, solids. Such calculations are based on the fact that the linear response function – that is, how the electron density changes when the external potential changes – has poles at the exact excitation energies of a system. Such calculations require, in addition to the exchange-correlation potential, the exchange-correlation kernel – the functional derivative of the exchange-correlation potential with respect to the density.\n\nThe approach of Runge and Gross considers a single-component system in the presence of a time-dependent scalar field for which the Hamiltonian takes the form\n\nwhere \"T\" is the kinetic energy operator, \"W\" the electron-electron interaction, and \"V\"(\"t\") the external potential which along with the number of electrons defines the system. Nominally, the external potential contains the electrons' interaction with the nuclei of the system. For non-trivial time-dependence, an additional explicitly time-dependent potential is present which can arise, for example, from a time-dependent electric or magnetic field. The many-body wavefunction evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation under a single initial condition,\n\nEmploying the Schrödinger equation as its starting point, the Runge-Gross theorem shows that at any time, the density uniquely determines the external potential. This is done in two steps:\n\n\nFor a given interaction potential, the RG theorem shows that the external potential uniquely determines the density. The Kohn-Sham approaches chooses a non-interacting system (that for which the interaction potential is zero) in which to form the density that is equal to the interacting system. The advantage of doing so lies in the ease in which non-interacting systems can be solved – the wave function of a non-interacting system can be represented as a Slater determinant of single-particle orbitals, each of which are determined by a single partial differential equation in three variable – and that the kinetic energy of a non-interacting system can be expressed exactly in terms of those orbitals. The problem is thus to determine a potential, denoted as \"v\"(r,\"t\") or \"v\"(r,\"t\"), that determines a non-interacting Hamiltonian, \"H\",\n\nwhich in turn determines a determinantal wave function\n\nwhich is constructed in terms of a set of \"N\" orbitals which obey the equation,\n\nand generate a time-dependent density\n\nsuch that \"ρ\" is equal to the density of the interacting system at all times:\n\nNote that in the expression of density above, the summation is over \"all\" formula_8 Kohn-Sham orbitals and formula_9 is the time-dependent occupation number for orbital formula_10. If the potential \"v\"(r,\"t\") can be determined, or at the least well-approximated, then the original Schrödinger equation, a single partial differential equation in 3\"N\" variables, has been replaced by \"N\" differential equations in 3 dimensions, each differing only in the initial condition.\n\nThe problem of determining approximations to the Kohn-Sham potential is challenging. Analogously to DFT, the time-dependent KS potential is decomposed to extract the external potential of the system and the time-dependent Coulomb interaction, \"v\". The remaining component is the exchange-correlation potential:\n\nIn their seminal paper, Runge and Gross approached the definition of the KS potential through an action-based argument starting from the Dirac action\n\nTreated as a functional of the wave function, \"A\"[Ψ], variations of the wave function yield the many-body Schrödinger equation as the stationary point. Given the unique mapping between densities and wave function, Runge and Gross then treated the Dirac action as a density functional,\n\nand derived a formal expression for the exchange-correlation component of the action, which determines the exchange-correlation potential by functional differentiation. Later it was observed that an approach based on the Dirac action yields paradoxical conclusions when considering the causality of the response functions it generates. The density response function, the functional derivative of the density with respect to the external potential, should be causal: a change in the potential at a given time can not affect the density at earlier times. The response functions from the Dirac action however are symmetric in time so lack the required causal structure. An approach which does not suffer from this issue was later introduced through an action based on the Keldysh formalism of complex-time path integration. An alternative resolution of the causality paradox through a refinement of the action principle \"in real time\" has been recently proposed by Vignale.\n\nLinear-response TDDFT can be used if the external perturbation is small in the\nsense that it does not completely destroy the ground-state structure of the system. In this case\none can analyze the linear response of the system. This is a great advantage as, to first order,\nthe variation of the system will depend only on the ground-state wave-function so that we can\nsimply use all the properties of DFT.\n\nConsider a small time-dependent external perturbation formula_14.\nThis gives\nand looking at the linear response of the density\nwhere formula_19\nHere and in the following it is assumed that primed variables are integrated.\n\nWithin the linear-response domain, the variation of the Hartree (H) and the\nexchange-correlation (xc) potential to linear order may be expanded with respect to the density variation\nand\nFinally, inserting this relation in the response equation for the KS system and comparing\nthe resultant equation with the response equation for the physical system yields the Dyson\nequation of TDDFT:\n\nFrom this last equation it is possible to derive the excitation energies of the system, as these are simply the poles of the response function.\n\nOther linear-response approaches include the Casida formalism (an expansion in electron-hole pairs) and the Sternheimer equation (density-functional perturbation theory).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Released as the album's second single in 2002, it peaked at number 21 on both the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart and the UK Singles Chart. It was also the band's first single to reach the U.S. Alternative Songs chart, peaking at number 12.\n\nThe song was covered in 2003 as \"Fell in Love with a Boy\" by Joss Stone and as a lounge song by Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine for their 2002 album \"Tuxicity\". It was also included on a polka medley by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, \"Angry White Boy Polka\", from his 2003 album \"Poodle Hat\".\n\nThe single was re-released as a 7\" vinyl record for Black Friday Record Store Day 2012 on opaque red vinyl by Third Man Records and later issued on standard black vinyl.\n\n\"Fell in Love with a Girl\" is an uptempo alternative rock and garage punk song that runs for a duration of one minute and fifty seconds. The track retains a brash rock instrumentation which consists of guitar and drums. It is built a slashing rhythm guitar groove set to a high-speed, stuttering beat with thrashing crash cymbals and skipped snare drum. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is written in the time signature of common time, with a fast tempo of 192 beats per minute. \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" is composed in the key of D Major, while Jack White's vocal range spans from a low of B to a high of A. The song has a basic sequence of B–A–D–E during the introduction and verses and follows F–A–D–E–F–A–F at the refrain as its chord progression.\n\nThe song opens with Jack White singing his lines with a manic vocal delivery at loud volume. His breathless performance exudes visceral intensity and quirky, exaggerated inflections. White's lyricism contains a dense slew of words laced with anxious banter and snappy humor. The musical arrangement comes to an abrupt hault at the last line of each verse. In substitution of a chorus, \"Fell In Love with a Girl\" features an infectious backing vocal line. After each verse, Jack White incessantly belts a wordless sing-along composed of \"ah-ah-ah-ah\" harmonizing.\n\nThe single met with widespread critical acclaim. Comparing it to that of the Ramones, Tom Maginnis from AllMusic called the single, \"an attention-grabbing chunk of primal punk rock confection that flames out in a breathless one minute and 50 seconds. ... Surrendering is the only option; to fight against the infectious brutal and relentless energy of \"Fell in Love With a Girl\" is an exercise in futility.\" The May 3, 2007 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine listed the song as one of the forty songs that changed the world. In 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 6 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". \"The Times\" said that the track \"mixes the blues with the Pixies.\" \"The Village Voice\"s \"Pazz & Jop critics' poll named \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" the sixth-best song of 2002.\n\nThe music video is a Lego animation directed by Michel Gondry. Gondry's son was featured at the beginning of the video, building Lego blocks. It was shot frame by frame with each frame having the Lego bricks rebuilt, sometimes in a complex manner to seem as if it were an actual shot, and then formed together to give the illusion of motion. The video mostly consists of red, white, and black color. The White Stripes couldn't strike a deal with Lego, so they had to buy a large amount of Lego boxes for the video.\n\nIn an interview for \"The Work of Director Michel Gondry\" DVD, Jack stated that the White Stripes' long-time collaboration with Gondry started by accident; for \"Fell in Love with a Girl\", Jack stated that he wanted to work with the director who did Beck's video for \"Devils Haircut\", referring to Mark Romanek. Their record company mistakenly hired Gondry, thinking he was the director of \"Devils Haircut\". Jack didn't mind, as he did the video for Beck's \"Deadweight\", which Jack also liked.\n\nIn \"The Work of Director Michel Gondry\" interview, Jack also said that the White Stripes contacted the Lego Group in hopes of having a small Lego set packaged with each single of the record, with which one could build a LEGO version of Jack and Meg White. The Lego Group refused, saying: \"We don't market our product to people over the age of twelve.\" However, once the video became a hit, Lego contacted the White Stripes again and asked if they could reconstruct the deal to have Lego packaged with the single. This time, however, Jack White refused.\n\n\"The Work of Director Michel Gondry\" DVD also reveals that one section, lasting only a few seconds, used computer animation to simulate the Lego bricks.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" said that \"the images enhance the lyrics...You can take the metaphor even deeper. As with Legos, love and sex can ultimately take whatever form your imagination desires.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" included it on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"An idea so simple it's a wonder no one thought of it before 2002: rock & roll Legos!\" \"Pitchfork\" deemed it the best video of the decade.\n\nThe video was spoofed on the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Ocean's Three and a Half\".\n\nThe music video received four nominations for Video of the Year, Breakthrough Video, Best Visual Effects, Best Editing at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, winning the latter three.\n\n\nThe single comes with a multimedia section featuring the \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" video.\nPart 1 with the identical track listing as the US Version.\n\nThis is the same recording of the song that would one year later be an album track on \"Elephant\" and eventually be released as a single.\n\nIn 2003, English singer Joss Stone covered the song, retitled \"Fell in Love with a Boy\", for her debut studio album, \"The Soul Sessions\" (2003). It was released on January 26, 2004 as the album's lead single.\n\nThe single received mostly positive reviews from critics. Dorian Lynskey of \"The Guardian\" raved that \"Fell in Love with a Boy\" is the best track from \"The Soul Sessions\" as well as \"the freshest and most deliciously inauthentic.\" \"PopMatters\" reviewer Jason MacNeil commented that Stone gives the song \"a groove-riddled, funky hip-shaker that never loses momentum.\" \"Rolling Stone\" said the tune sounded like \"a lost Memphis-soul classic.\" However, Jim Greer of \"Entertainment Weekly\" viewed her version as \"the only misguided ploy\" on the album. Andrew McGregor wrote for BBC Music that it \"blends so well into the funky soul landscape that those less familiar with contemporary rock might miss the ironic juxtaposition altogether.\"\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"The Soul Sessions\".\n\n\n\n"}

However, many boats are made of materials that are denser than water, meaning that the boat will sink if filled with water. Although it is not required by the rules of the competition, some competitive concrete canoes have concrete mix designs that are less dense than water. They must pass a test in which the canoe is filled with water and pushed below the surface; the canoe must then resurface in order to qualify for racing. This is possible because, unlike normal concrete which uses sand and small rocks, concrete canoes are created with porous aggregates such as Macrolite and microspheres. However, because many teams still design their concrete mixes to be denser than water, in the United States, teams are allowed to insert concrete-covered, non-structural foam pieces in their canoes to make the canoes float after being submerged.\n\nThe ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) National Concrete Canoe Competition (NCCC) provides students with a practical application of the engineering principles they learn in the classroom, along with important team and project management skills they will need in their careers. The event challenges the students' knowledge, creativity and stamina, while showcasing the versatility and durability of concrete as a building material.\n\nEach year, the NCCC, which is held in mid-June, is hosted by an ASCE Student Organization. Some 200 university teams attempt to qualify for the NCCC by placing first in one of the 18 conference competitions held throughout the United States during the spring. Until 2018, teams placing second in a conference competition behind a university that finished in the top five at the previous year's national competition are also invited. This was replaced by the Wild Card drawing in 2018. If the Concrete Canoe team was part of a student chapter that placed within the top one-third of all annual reports, and the team finished within the top half of all teams in their regional competition, the team was eligible for the Wild Card drawing. Of all qualifying team, six were randomly drawn to attend the 2018 National Concrete Competition. To be eligible to compete in the Concrete Canoe Competition, the entrant school must be a recognized ASCE Student Chapter or ASCE International Student Group. Typically, frontrunners include University of Alabama, Huntsville, University of Nevada, Reno, University of Florida, California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo, the University of California at Berkeley, Clemson University, École de technologie supérieure, Université Laval, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nThe winners of the ASCE National Concrete Canoe Competition are determined by compiling the team's total number of points from the academic and race portions of the competition. Academic scholarships totaling $9,000 are awarded to the winning teams' undergraduate civil engineering program.\n\nConcrete Canoe competition in the United States began in the 1960s, when a small number of ASCE student chapters began holding intramural Concrete Canoe races. Then, in the 1971, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign held the first intercollegiate race against Purdue. In the more than 45 years since, the students’ efforts to combine engineering excellence and hydrodynamic design to construct water-worthy canoes have culminated in an advanced form of concrete construction and racing technique known as the “America’s Cup of Civil Engineering.”\n\nIn 1981 as part of the FIP congress in Stockholm, Sweden there was the 1st FIP international concrete canoe race. won by the Danish team from Technical University of Denmark. inspired by \n\nIn 1988, ASCE expanded the competition to the national level, when Master Builders, Inc. (now known as BASF) signed-on to become the sole corporate sponsor for the event. In its first year, 18 teams of enthusiastic civil engineering students from the nation's premier academic programs gathered in East Lansing, Mich., to test the waters of this innovative and educational event. Over the next two decades, the competition became a great success, with regional winners traveling across the country by plane, train and Ryder truck, canoes in tow, in their quest to become National Concrete Canoe Competition champions.\n\nAs competition was developing in the United States, the idea had also taken hold in other countries. Today, concrete canoe racing happens around the world in places like Germany, South Africa, Canada, Japan and the United Arab Emirates; and with sponsorship from ASCE and the American Concrete Institute (ACI), the 2007 National Concrete Canoe Competition winning team, University of Wisconsin - Madison, travelled to the Netherlands to represent the United States in the 30th Annual Dutch Concrete Canoe Challenge.\n\nThe Concrete Canoe Competition is designed to provide civil engineering students with an opportunity to gain hands-on, practical experience and leadership skills by working with concrete mix designs and project management. Organizers, sponsors and participants are dedicated to building awareness of concrete technology and application, as well as the versatility and durability of concrete as a construction material, among civil engineering students, educators, practitioners, the concrete industry and the general public. They also strive to increase awareness among industry leaders, opinion makers and the general public of civil engineering as a dynamic and innovative profession essential to society. In its history, the National Concrete Canoe Competition has challenged the knowledge, creativity and stamina of more than 400 teams and 5000 students. In 2008, more than 200 teams competed in 18 conference competitions to qualify for participation at the national level.\n\nSponsors include BASF, Kiewit Corporation, American Concrete Institute, Holcim, Bentley Systems, Cemex, and Propex\n\nTeams of engineering students will gather for a weekend designed to be both challenging and fun. Twenty-five percent of each team's total team score will be based on the engineering design and construction principles used in the creation of their concrete canoe; 25 percent will be based on a technical design report detailing the planning, development, testing and construction of their canoe; and 25 percent will be based on a formal business presentation highlighting the canoe's design, construction, racing ability and other innovative features. The remaining 25 percent of each team's score is based on the performance of the canoe and the paddlers in five different race events: men's and women's slalom/endurance races, and men's, women's and co-ed sprint races.\n\nFor the purpose of the competition, concrete is defined as a mixture of cement, of which at least 30% (by mass) must be portland cement, and aggregate, which must constitute at least 25% (by volume) of the mix. The aggregate need not be conventional construction aggregate (sand, etc.), but may include materials such as hollow glass beads and fibers. Epoxy is not permitted. Up to 50% of the thickness of the canoe may be a reinforcement mesh.\nConcrete canoe teams must design their canoes from scratch. Typically they create the shape of the hull with a computer design program specifically made for yachts, canoes, and other watercraft. The shape is optimized for racing. This hull shape is then given to a construction team, responsible for making a mold for the canoe to be formed on. A special concrete mix is designed over several months, emphasizing among other qualities, an optimal balance between strength and low density. The finalized mix design is placed on the form; the hull thickness usually ranges from about 3/8\" to 3/4\". Teams later spend hundreds of hours sanding and applying exterior graphics to their canoes for a nice finish. Scoring in the competition is based on the quality of construction, race performance, a design paper, and a business presentation.\n\n\n\nConcrete Canoe competitions have a significant following from both present and past competitors. The concrete canoe community now includes a dedicated concrete canoe news website, ConcreteCanoe.org, which follows competitions around the world, as well as Concrete Canoe Magazine, which publishes scientific papers, studies, and articles written on the techniques used by top teams.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2331554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331554", "title": "Carlo Cattaneo", "text": "Carlo Cattaneo\n\nCarlo Cattaneo (; Milan, June 15, 1801 – Castagnola, February 6, 1869) was an Italian philosopher and writer, famous for his role in the Five Days of Milan on March 1848, when he led the city council during the rebellion.\n\nCattaneo was born in Milan. A republican in his convictions, during his youth he had taken part in the Carbonari movement in Lombardy. He devoted himself to the study of philosophy, with the hope of regenerating Italian people by withdrawing them from romanticism and rhetoric, and turning their attention to the positive sciences. In this period, Cattaneo met philosopher Giandomenico Romagnosi and he \"was especially attracted by Romagnosi's emphasis on practical solutions and interdisciplinary work\". Developing some intuitions coming from his mentor, Cattaneo expounded his ideas in a review founded by him in Milan in 1839, called \"II Politecnico\". He resided at the Palazzo Gavazzi from 1840 until 1848.\n\nWhen the revolution of 1848 broke out, he threw himself heart and soul into the fray, and became one of the leading spirits of the insurrection against the Austrians, known as the Five Days of Milan (March 18 – 22, 1848). Together with the young democrats Enrico Cernuschi, Giulio Terzaghi and Giorgio Clerici he formed a council of war which, having its headquarters at Palazzo Taverna in via Bigli, directed the operations of the insurgents. He was second to none in self-sacrifice and heroic resolution. When on March 18 Field Marshal Radetzky, feeling that the position of the Austrian garrison was untenable, sounded the rebels as to their terms, some of the leaders were inclined to agree to an armistice which would give time for the Piedmontese troops to arrive (Piedmont had just declared war), but Cattaneo insisted on the complete evacuation of Lombardy. Again, on March 21, Radetzky tried to obtain an armistice, and Durini and Borromeo were ready to grant it, for it would have enabled them to reorganize the defences and replenish the supplies of food and ammunition, which could only last another day. However, Cattaneo replied:\n\nThe enemy having furnished us with munitions thus far, will continue to do so. Twenty-four hours of victuals and twenty-four hours of hunger will be many more hours than we shall need. This evening, if the plans we have just arranged should succeed, the line of the bastions will be broken. At any rate, even though we should lack bread, it is better to die of hunger than on the gallows.\nOn the expulsion of the Austrians the question arose as to the future government of Milan and Italy. Cattaneo was an uncompromising republican and a federalist; so violent was his dislike of the Piedmontese monarchy that when he heard that King Charles Albert had been defeated by the Austrians, and that Radetzky was marching back to reoccupy Milan, he exclaimed:\n\nGood news, the Piedmontese have been beaten. Now we shall be our own masters; we shall fight a people's war, we shall chase the Austrians out of Italy, and set up a Federal Republic.\n\nWhen the Austrians returned, Cattaneo had to flee and took refuge in Lugano, where he gave lessons, wrote his Storia della Rivoluzione del 1848 (History of the 1848 Revolution), the Archivio triennale delle cose d'Italia (3 vols., 1850–1855), then, early in 1860, he started publishing the Politecnico once more. He strongly opposed Cavour for his unitarian views, and for the cession of Nice and Savoy. In 1860 Garibaldi summoned him to Naples to take part in the government of the Neapolitan provinces, but he would not agree to the union with Piedmont without local autonomy. After the union of Italy he was frequently asked to stand for parliament, but always refused because he could not conscientiously take the oath of allegiance to the monarchy. In 1868 the pressure of friends overcame his resistance, and he agreed to stand, but at the last moment he drew back, still unable to take the oath, and returned to Lugano, where he died in 1869.\n\nAs a writer, Cattaneo was learned and brilliant, but some view him as being too bitter a partisan to be judicious, owing to his narrowly republican views; his ideas on local autonomy were wise, but, at a moment when unity was regarded as an absolute requisite, they were deemed inopportune.\n\nGaetano Salvemini considered him one of 19th century Italy's men of genius along with Giacomo Leopardi, Camillo Benso di Cavour, and Francesco de Sanctis.\n\nHe died in Castagnola, close to Lugano in the Swiss canton of Ticino, where he had spent the last twenty years of his life in exile.\n\n\n\nNorberto Bobbio, \"Una filosofia militante: studi su Carlo Cattaneo\", Einaudi, Torino 1971.\n"}

Tran and Texas State Representative Hubert Vo were the highest-ranking Vietnamese American elected officials in U.S. history until Joseph Cao was elected to the United States House of Representatives in December 2008. Tran took office one month before Vo did, making him the first Vietnamese American to serve in a state legislature. He served in the Assembly as Assistant Republican Leader.\n\nBorn in Saigon, South Vietnam, Tran and his family emigrated to the United States after being evacuated by the United States Army one week before the Fall of Saigon, when he was 10 years old. After originally settling in Michigan, they moved to Orange County when Tran was a teenager.\n\nTran worked as an intern and later as a staff aide for Congressman Bob Dornan and for State Senator Ed Royce while a student at the University of California, Irvine, where he earned a B.A. in Political Science in 1990. Tran completed a Master of Public Administration from Hamline University and a J.D. from Hamline University School of Law. He was admitted to the California State Bar in 1994.\n\nIn 2000, Tran was elected to the Garden Grove City Council with the highest number of votes in city history and became only the second Vietnamese American man to be elected to office in the United States (Tony Lam was the first when he was elected to the city council of neighboring Westminster in 1992). After serving one term on the council, he was elected to the California State Assembly to replace outgoing Republican state assemblyman Ken Maddox, who was forced to retire due to term limits. Tran was re-elected to the Assembly in 2006 and 2008.\n\nTran represented the 68th District. He was the Vice Chair of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. He also serves on the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee and the Assembly Governmental Organization Committee. In June 2007, he was appointed by the Assembly Speaker as chairman of the Select Committee on International Trade.\n\nOn December 21, 2005, Tran announced that he would launch an exploratory committee for a 2006 run against Democratic First District Orange County Supervisor Lou Correa in the race for the State Senate seat being vacated by term limited Democrat Joe Dunn. Tran opted not to join the race, allowing Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher to win the Republican nomination with nominal opposition, and she went on to lose the general election to Correa by a 1% margin.\n\nOn November 7, 2006, Tran was re-elected to the Assembly with 62% of the vote.\n\nTran challenged and lost to Democratic incumbent Loretta Sanchez.

Enviga is a trademark of Nestlé licensed to Beverage Partners Worldwide, a joint-venture between The Coca-Cola Company and Nestlé. It is available in three flavors: Green Tea, Tropical Pomegranate, and Mixed Berry. According to Coca-Cola, Enviga burns 60 to 100 calories per three 12-oz.(330 ml) cans due to its high EGCG and caffeine content. This is disputed by some researchers and public advocates.\n\nA can of Enviga has 5 calories, 100 mg of caffeine, 35 mg of sodium, and 20% of the daily recommended calcium based on a 2,000 calorie diet. It is sweetened with aspartame and has no carbohydrates, fat, or protein.\n\nIn February 2007, the watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) filed a lawsuit over company claims that Enviga acts as a calorie-burning and weight-loss product, as a \"negative calorie\" drink. The group claims that if Coca-Cola and Nestlé stop marketing the product as a calorie-burner, they would drop possible litigation. The beverage makers responded that they have deliberately avoided claims that Enviga is a weight-loss product, and that there exists independent research to substantiate the effects of the product. The watchdog group alleged that it was only a 3-day study, and that it was only presented in a conference by the Obesity Society, the editors of journal \"Obesity\", where their conclusions were rejected. The lack of validity of the study was later referred to by the Attorney General in the settlement. Studies on the combination of caffeine and green tea anti-oxidant have given mixed results, and the results are not conclusive.\n\nThe State of Connecticut also investigated the calorie-burning qualities of the drink. The State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal demanded all scientific research associated with its calorie-burning qualities.\n\nIn February 2009 the companies made a settlement with Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, affecting several US states. They agreed to pay $650,000 to the states, remove any claims about weight loss, and add disclaimers that weight loss can only occur via diet and exercise. According to the US Federal News Service, the settlement requires that \"any marketing of Enviga, or a similarly formulated beverage, that uses the terms 'the calorie burner,' 'negative calories,' 'drink negative,' or makes any claims explicitly or implicitly that consumers will burn calories by drinking Enviga, there must be a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the product does not produce weight loss without diet and exercise.\"\n\nIn 2010, a US court of appeals didn't allow a woman to sue Coca-Cola for weight-loss false advertising, and CSPI reported that it wouldn't appeal the decision. CSPI said that the sales of Enviga had collapsed after its 2009 settlement, and that it had already met its goal of informing customers about the lack of efficacy of the beverage. CSPI announced that it was suing Coca-Cola again, but this time for its new beverage Vitaminwater.\n\nAs reported in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", flavoured bottled water, sports drinks and teas, are increasing sales with the decline in sales of sugary soft drinks - with cold tea the fastest growing non-carbonated beverage category in the U.S. during the first half of 2006. Prior to launch, Coke had been trailing and losing market share in this sector to Pepsi, AriZona and Snapple.\n\nDiscontinued:\n\n\nSince the brand's inception, and the launch of the three original flavors, peach was the first to be dropped in favor of pomegranate as the third flavor.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Berlin House of Representatives (2006–2011) and a member of the executive board of the CDU (2000-2010). Today, he is a businessman and Visiting Professor of International Relations and Director of the European Centre for Energy and Resource Security (EUCERS) at King's College London.\n\nFriedbert Pflüger was born in Hanover. He received his \"Abitur\" (university entrance qualification) at Friedrich Schiller High School in Hanover in 1973. He studied political science, public and constitutional law and economics in Göttingen, Bonn and at Harvard. He received his Master of Arts degree in 1980 and in 1982 his Dr. phil. degree. His doctoral thesis was directed by Karl Dietrich Bracher and examined US-foreign policy \"between idealism and realism\". In 1980/81, he was a graduate student associate at the Harvard Center for International Affairs (CFIA) under the auspices of Samuel Huntington. He also taught a seminar on US human rights policy at Harvard.\n\nSince 1971, Pflüger has been a member of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU). The first political offices he held were as deputy chairman of the European Democrat Students (EDS) from 1976 to 1978 and as federal chairman of the Association of Christian Democrat Students (RCDS) from 1977 to 1978.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1985, Pflüger was also a member of the federal executive committee of the Young Union (JU), the youth organization of the CDU/CSU, under the leadership of successive chairmen Matthias Wissmann and Christoph Böhr.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1984, Pflüger worked for the governing mayor of Berlin, Richard von Weizsäcker. When Weizsäcker became the Federal President of Germany in 1984, Pflüger became his spokesman and speechwriter, a job he kept during all the presidency until 1989.

By inheritance, he was Count of Verdun and he became Margrave of Antwerp as a vassal of the Duke of Lower Lorraine. The Holy Roman Emperor Henry III authorized him to succeed his father as Duke of Upper Lorraine in 1044, but refused him the ducal title in Lower Lorraine, for he feared the power of a united duchy. Instead Henry threatened to appoint a younger son, Gothelo, as Duke in Lower Lorraine. At a much later date, Godfrey became Duke of Lower Lorraine, but he had lost the upper duchy by that point in time.\n\nGodfrey rebelled against his King and devastated land in Lower Lorraine, as well as the City of Verdun; which, though his by inheritance, Henry had not given him. He was soon defeated by an imperial army, deposed and imprisoned together with his son (Gibichenstein, 1045). When his son died in prison, the war recommenced. Baldwin V of Flanders joined Godfrey and Henry gave Thierry, Bishop of Verdun, the eponymous county. Godfrey surprised the Bishop (who escaped) and sacked Verdun, burning the cathedral. On 11 November 1048 at Thuin, Godfrey fell on Adalbert, his replacement in Upper Lorraine, and defeated him, killing him in battle. Henry immediately nominated the young Gerard of Chatenoy to replace Adalbert at the Diet of Worms. In his subsequent campaigns to take the Moselle region, Godfrey met with stiff resistance from Gerard and was forced to renounce his claims and reconcile with the Bishop. He even assisted in rebuilding the cathedral he had destroyed.\n\nIn 1053, his first wife Doda having died, Godfrey remarried Beatrice of Bar, the widow of Boniface III of Tuscany and mother of Matilda, Boniface's heir. Henry arrested Beatrice and her young son Frederick and imprisoned her in Germany, separate from either husband or son, who died within days. The emperor claimed the marriage had been contracted without his consent and was invalid. Young Frederick died a short while later. Nevertheless, Godfrey took over the government of the Tuscany in right of Beatrice and Matilda.\n\nBaldwin V then rebelled, carrying the war to Trier and Nijmegen. Henry responded by devastating Flanders and ravaging Lille and Tournai (1054). In this war, Godfrey captured Frederick of Luxembourg, Duke of Lower Lorraine, who had received that duchy, including Antwerp, from Henry III.\n\nIn 1055, Godfrey besieged Antwerp, but Frederick was delivered by the Lorrainers, no longer loyal to Godfrey. Henry died in 1056 and his successor, Henry IV, was only six years old. In that year, Baldwin made peace and did homage to the new King. In 1056 and 1059, by the treaties of Andernach, Baldwin received the March of Ename in the Landgraviate of Brabant, probably in exchange for giving up the March of Valenciennes, which was confiscated by Emperor Henry III in 1045.\n\nIn 1057, Godfrey was exiled to Tuscany, where he joined Beatrice and co-governed with her. He was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Spoleto (1057) by Pope Stephen IX, his brother. In January 1058, Leo de Benedicto Christiano threw open the city gates to him and Beatrice after the election of Pope Nicholas II. Possessing the Tiber and assaulting the Lateran, Godfrey succeeded in expelling the antipope Benedict X on 24 January. During the papal reign of his brother and his brother's reforming successors, he played an important role in the politics of central and northern Italy, including Sardinia, where he interfered on behalf of Barisone I of Logudoro against the Republic of Pisa, indicating his authority over both.\n\nIn 1065, he was recalled to become Duke of Lower Lorraine after the death of Frederick. He was also given Antwerp again. He installed his court at Bouillon and died on Christmas Eve 1069.\n\nBy Doda, possibly a daughter of her namesake Dada and Manasses II of Rethel, he had:\n\n\n\n"}
