{"id": "2220157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220157", "title": "Pumpkin seed", "text": "Pumpkin seed\n\nA pumpkin seed, also known in North America as a pepita (from the Mexican , \"little seed of squash\"), is the edible seed of a pumpkin or certain other cultivars of squash. The seeds are typically flat and asymmetrically oval, have a white outer husk, and are light green in color after the husk is removed. Some cultivars are huskless, and are grown only for their edible seed. The seeds are nutrient- and calorie-rich, with especially high content of fat (particularly linoleic acid and oleic acid), protein, dietary fiber, and numerous micronutrients. \"Pumpkin seed\" can refer either to the hulled kernel or unhulled whole seed, and most commonly refers to the roasted end product used as a snack.\n\nPumpkin seeds are a common ingredient in Mexican cuisine and are also roasted and served as a snack. Marinated and roasted, they are an autumn seasonal snack in the United States, as well as a commercially produced and distributed packaged snack, like sunflower seeds, available year-round. Pepitas are known by their Spanish name (usually shortened), and typically salted and sometimes spiced after roasting (and today also available as a packaged product), in Mexico and other Latin American countries, in the American Southwest, and in specialty and Mexican food stores.\n\nThe earliest known evidence of the domestication of \"Cucurbita\" dates back 8,000–10,000 years ago, predating the domestication of other crops such as maize and common beans in the region by about 4,000 years. Changes in fruit shape and color indicate intentional breeding of \"C. pepo\" occurred by no later than 8,000 years ago. The process to develop the agricultural knowledge of crop domestication took place over 5,000–6,500 years in Mesoamerica. Squash was domesticated first, with maize second, followed by beans, all becoming part of the Three Sisters agricultural system.\n\nAs an ingredient in mole dishes, they are known in Spanish as \"pipián\". A Mexican snack using pepitas in an artisan fashion is referred to as \"pepitoría\". Lightly roasted, salted, unhulled pumpkin seeds are popular in Greece with the descriptive Italian name, \"passatempo\" (\"pastime\").\n\nThe pressed oil of the roasted seeds of a \"Cucurbita pepo\" subsp. \"pepo\" var. 'styriaca' is also used in Central and Eastern Europe as cuisine. An example of this is pumpkin seed oil. Pumpkin seeds can also be made into a nut butter.\n\nDried, roasted pumpkin seeds are 2% water, 49% fat, 15% carbohydrates, and 30% protein (table). In a 100 gram reference serving, the seeds are calorie-dense (574 kcal), and a rich source (20% of the Daily Value, DV, or higher) of protein, dietary fiber, niacin, iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium, and phosphorus (table). The seeds are a moderate source (10–19% DV) of riboflavin, folate, pantothenic acid, sodium, and potassium (table). Major fatty acids in pumpkin seeds are linoleic acid and oleic acid, with palmitic acid and stearic acid in lesser amounts.\n\nThe oil of pumpkin seeds, a culinary specialty in and important export commodity of Central Europe, is used in cuisine as a salad and cooking oil.\n\nThe following are ranges of fatty acid content in \"C. maxima\" pepitas (see pumpkin seed oil):<br>\nThe total unsaturated fatty acid concentration ranged from 9% to 21% of the pepita. The total fat content ranged from 11% to 52%. Based on the quantity of alpha-tocopherol extracted in the oil, the vitamin E content of twelve \"C. maxima\" cultivar seeds ranged from 4 to 19 mg/100 g of pepita.\n\nPumpkin seeds were once used as an anthelmintic in traditional medicine in China to expel tapeworms parasites, such as \"Taenia\" tapeworms. This led to the seeds being listed in the \"United States Pharmacopoeia\" as an antiparasitic from 1863 until 1936.\n\n"}
{"id": "2220159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220159", "title": "Writing implement", "text": "Writing implement\n\nA writing implement or writing instrument is an object used to produce writing. Writing consists of different figures, lines, and or forms. Most of these items can be also used for other functions such as painting, drawing and technical drawing, but writing instruments generally have the ordinary requirement to create a smooth, controllable line.\n\nAnother writing implement employed by a smaller population, is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the slate for punching out the dots in Braille.\n\nThese have an inherent functionality in that their useful life corresponds to the length of their physical existence, i.e. they cannot \"run out\" and persist as useless objects.\n\nThe oldest known examples were created by incising a flat surface with a rigid tool rather than applying pigment with a secondary object, e.g., Chinese jiaguwen carved into turtle shells. However, this may simply represent the relative durability of such artifacts rather than truly representing the evolution of techniques, as the meaningful application of pigment is attested in prehistoric cave paintings such as the ones at Lascaux.\n\nThe ancient Sumerians and their successor cultures, such as the Babylonians, produced their cuneiform writing by pressing a triangular stylus into soft clay tablets, creating characteristic wedge-shaped marks. The clay tablets were then baked to harden them and permanently preserve the marks.\n\nSeveral other ancient cultures such as Mycenaean Greece also inscribed their records into clay tablets but did not routinely bake them; much of the Linear B corpus from Minoan Crete was accidentally preserved by a catastrophic fire which hard-baked those tablets. The Romans used lead styli with wax tablets which could be \"erased\" by rubbing the beeswax surface smooth again.\n\nIn the modern era, hand held computers and certain other computer input devices use a stylus to enter information onto a screen by applying pressure rather than by depositing pigment.\n\nWords and names are still commonly inscribed into commemorative objects, such as the engraved winners' names on the silver Stanley Cup or the Gettysburg Address carved into the stone wall of the Lincoln Memorial, but the requisite tools are not exclusively considered to be writing instruments.\n\nThe original form of \"lead pencil\" was the leaden stylus used by the ancient Romans, who also used it to write on wood or papyrus by leaving dark streaks where the soft metal rubbed off onto the surface. The concept has been revived in recent times as the core of the \"inkless pen\": a lead-based metal alloy that leaves dark markings on paper by abrading small pieces of core onto the surface.\n\nHowever, most modern \"lead pencils\" have a nonpoisonous core of greyish-black graphite mixed with various proportions of clay for consistency, enclosed within an outer wooden casing to protect the fragile graphite from being snapped apart or from leaving marks on the user's hand.\n\nWhite chalk has been traditionally used in schoolrooms to write on a main blackboard at the front of the room. In the 19th century, and indeed well into the 20th century, when paper was less readily available, individual students also wrote with chalk on their own small slates.\n\nBoth pencils and chalk exist in variants which can create marks in other colors, but colored pencils and colored chalk are generally considered to be art supplies rather than writing instruments. Similarly, although very young children may use colorful wax crayons to write words into their pictures, writing is not considered to be the primary use of crayons.\n\nA wax pencil resembles both a crayon and a pencil in that it contains a brightly colored wax core within a protective paper casing, but its proportions are closer to that of a standard pencil. Wax pencils are primarily used to write onto nonporous surfaces such as porcelain or glass.\n\nNormal pencils, chalk, and crayons all share the characteristic that they cannot \"run out\". The useful life of these implements is closely linked to their physical existence. However, specialized accessories such as pencil sharpeners may be required to reshape the working end of the pigment core or to remove the outer casing from around the tip.\n\nThese require the presence of an added pigment in order to write, and are useless when \"empty\".\n\nThe pen is the most common form of writing implement. It has a hard tip which applies ink to a surface.\n\nInitially, pens were made by slicing a suitable nib point from the end of a thin, hollow natural material which could retain a small reservoir of ink by capillary action. However, these ink reservoirs were relatively small, requiring the pen to be periodically dipped back into an external inkwell for replenishing.\n\nReed pens were used by the ancient Egyptians to write on papyrus. Quill pens were standard in Europe and the United States up through the 18th and 19th centuries, and are still used in various contexts, such as calligraphy and formal settings such as major bank transactions. The most common quills were taken from the wings of geese or ravens, although the feathers of swans and peacocks were sometimes favored for prestige.\n\nA dip pen has a steel nib (the pen proper) and a pen-holder. Dip pens are very versatile, as the pen-holder can accommodate a wide variety of nibs that are specialized for different purposes: copperplate writing, mapping pens, and five-pointed nibs for drawing music staves. They can be used with most types of ink, some of which are incompatible with other types of pen. Automatic pens are a category of dip pen, in which the nib is in two parts and can hold a larger quantity of ink. However, like all of its precursors, the steel-nibbed dip pens had a limited ink reservoir and a tendency to drip inkblots on the page.\n\nFountain pens were developed in the 19th century. These consist of the nib unit, an ink reservoir chamber, and an external casing. The casing usually includes a cover for the nib, in order to protect its shape and keep the ink from evaporating dry or wicking into the user's pocket. Depending on the design of the pen, the ink reservoir can be filled in several different ways: direct addition by eyedropper, suction from an internal mechanism, or disposable pre-filled cartridges. Some cartridge-based fountain pens can be fitted with \"converters\", which are separate piston/suction reservoirs of the same dimensions as the pen's usual refill cartridge; these allow the pen to refill from bottled ink.\n\nOnly certain types of ink can be used in a fountain pen, to avoid clogging up the nib unit mechanism. Although the larger reservoir of fountain pens requires less frequent ink replenishment, the ink may inconveniently spill out in certain contexts to stain the paper, fingers, or clothing of an unwary writer. Differences in air pressure may cause spectacular effects when travelling by airplane.\n\nA large number of new pen types were popularized in the 20th century. Some of them are not constructed to be refilled with ink after they run dry; although others can theoretically have their internal ink compartment replaced, the widespread custom is to simply throw away the entire pen when its ink is no longer accessible.\n\nThese types include the ballpoint pen (often called a biro in many Commonwealth countries) and the felt tip pen. Both of these have subtypes which are popularly called by their own specific names, usually based on the type of their ink, such as the fluorescent highlighter, the rollerball pen, and the gel pen.\n\nUnlike the construction of a traditional wooden pencil around a solid graphite core, a mechanical pencil feeds a small, mobile piece of graphite through its tip. An internal mechanism controls the position of the graphite by friction, so that although it remains steady while writing, the graphite can be advanced forward to compensate for gradual wear or retracted to protect it when not in use. The graphite in mechanical pencils is typically much narrower than in wooden pencils, frequently in sub-millimeter diameters. This makes them particularly useful for fine diagrams or small handwriting, although different sizes of refill leads cannot be interchanged in the same pencil unless it has been specially designed for that purpose.\n\nAlthough in Western civilization writing is usually done with some form of pencil or pen, other cultures have used other instruments. Chinese characters are traditionally written with a brush, which is perceived as lending itself to a graceful, flowing stroke.\n\nA brush differs from a pen in that instead of a rigid nib, the brush is tipped with soft bristles. The bristles are gently swept across the paper with just enough pressure to allow ink to wick onto the surface, rather than mashing down the brush to the extent of substantial friction resistance. Although pens with semi-flexible nibs and liquid ink can also vary their stroke width depending on the degree of applied pressure, their variation range is far less obvious.\n\nTraditionally, brushes have been loaded with ink by dipping the bristles into an external pool of ink on an inkstone, analogous to a traditional dip pen with an inkwell. Some companies now make \"brush pens\" which in that regard resemble a fountain pen, with an internal ink reservoir built into the handle which can be refilled with preloaded cartridges or a bottle-fill converter.\n\nOther implements indirectly associated with writing include erasers for pen and pencil, pencil sharpeners, pencil extenders, inkwells, blotter paper, and rulers and related drawing instruments. Pounce pots were a precursor of blotting paper, being a dispenser for powdery material for drying the paper. Stencils can be used to create standardised letters, patterns or signatures. There are also pencil sharpeners that can exclusively be used with wooden pencils. \n\n"}

He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens.\n\nBorn in 1868, Paine's father was Charles Jackson Paine, who was a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and also was the older brother to John Paine. Sumner briefly attended Harvard University before ending up at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, he earned an M.D. but never practiced, instead he went off to Paris, France, to work.\n\nPaine entered all three of the pistol events in the 1896 Games. He, along with his brother John Paine, was disqualified from the rapid fire pistol because their firearms were not of the appropriate caliber.\n\nThe Paine brothers used Colt revolvers in the 25 metre military pistol event, these pistols were superior to the arms used by their opponents, and the brothers had little difficulty winning the top two spots. Sumner finished second with 380 points on 23 hits (of 30 shots) to John's 442 points on 25 hits. The next closest shooter (Nikolaos Morakis from Greece) scored only 205 points.\n\nAfter winning the military pistol, John withdrew from the 30 metre free pistol event, Sumner easily won this event as well, scoring exactly the same number of points (442) as John had to win the military pistol event, he did this on one fewer hit (24), though, in this case, the second place competitor scored 285 points.\n\nIn 1901, Paine went home to find his wife in bed with his daughter's music teacher. To ward him away from the house, he shot four times at him, missing each time. He was briefly jailed and charged with assault until the police realized who he was and accepted that he must have missed on purpose. He was then released.\n\nPaine died aged just 35 years old due to pneumonia.\n"}

Kilgore\n\nHarley Martin Kilgore (January 11, 1893 – February 28, 1956) was a United States Senator from West Virginia.\n\nHe was born on January 11, 1893 in Brown, West Virginia. He was born to Quimby Hugh Kilgore and Laura Jo Kilgore. His father worked as an oil driller and contractor. He attended the public schools and graduated from the law department of West Virginia University at Morgantown in 1914 and was admitted to the bar the same year.\n\nHe taught school in Hancock, West Virginia in 1914 and 1915, and organized the first high school in Raleigh County, West Virginia in the latter year. He was the school's first principal for a year, and commenced the practice of law in Beckley, West Virginia in 1916. During the First World War he served in the infantry from 1917 and was discharged as a captain in 1920; in 1921 he organized the West Virginia National Guard and retired as a colonel in 1953. He was married to Lois Elaine Lilly in Huntington, West Virginia, in 1921.\n\nHe was judge of the Raleigh County criminal court from 1933 to 1940, and was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1940, and won re-election twice. He was a member of the Senate from January 3, 1941 until his death in Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1956. Kilgore was a member of the Truman Committee, and from October 1942, he chaired the Subcommittee on War Mobilization of the Military Affairs Committee, otherwise known as the Kilgore Committee, that oversaw U.S. mobilization efforts for World War II. He also helped establish the National Science Foundation in 1950.\n\nSenator Kilgore was West Virginia's favorite-son candidate in 1948 Democratic presidential primaries and won his home state unopposed.\n\nHe died on February 28, 1956, aged 63 and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nIn 1942, American manufacturing expert Herbert Schimmel advised Kilgore to form a committee to centralize scientific research done for the war effort. The Kilgore Committee drafted legislation for an Office of Technological Mobilization, which would have power to fund research, share patents and trade secrets, and facilities that could help the war effort. Additionally, the organization would be able to draft scientists and facilities for the war effort.\n\nIn 1943, government scientists, most notably Vannevar Bush, voiced agreement with the spirit of Kilgore's proposal, but opposed the bill's aim to involve government administration of science funding and patent sharing. As the war neared its end, many prominent scientists feared a peacetime Kilgore plan. The Kilgore Committee, in an effort to mollify scientists concerned with a government-run funding agency, proposed calling the proposed organization a Foundation, to give the superficial impression of a private, philanthropic funding body like the Rockefeller Foundation. The scientists running the war-time Office of Scientific Research and Development sought to bypass the Kilgore Committee in forming a postwar science policy. While ostensibly working with Kilgore to plan for a science administration, Vannevar Bush privately obtained an invitation from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to write his own plan for a government-funded science foundation. Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington introduced a proposal based on Bush's report, \"Science, the Endless Frontier\", in July 1945. The report contradicted much of Kilgore's vision of a science-funding organization accountable to the government. Kilgore felt betrayed by Bush's failure to mention this alternate bill, and remained on hostile terms with Bush for years afterwards.\n\nAfter many months of negotiations with interest groups of scientists and manufacturers, Kilgore and Magnuson introduced a modified bill to fund the National Science Foundation in 1946, which did not pass. At the same time, Republican Senator Alexander Smith of New Jersey introduced a bill for an agency more similar to Bush's vision. The Smith bill passed both houses of United States Congress. Kilgore encouraged his former colleague, now President Harry S. Truman to veto the Smith bill, in large part because of the potential it made for the military to dominate scientific research. Truman followed Kilgore's advice and let the bill expire through a pocket veto. Kilgore also encouraged Truman to establish a Presidential Research Board to be led by John Steelman, former Director of the War Mobilization and Reconversion, which Truman then did in October 1946.\n\nBy 1948, other agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Defense had been established to fund specific domains of scientific research. The National Science Foundation would now solely fund basic science. In early 1948, Truman, Steelman, and Senator Smith reached a compromise in administration of the foundation. Later that year, Kilgore and Smith cosponsored the bill that President Truman would finally sign on May 10, 1950 to establish the National Science Foundation.\n\n"}

It is situated in the city of Carlisle, Cumbria and has a certified capacity of 18,202. The ground opened in 1909. Brunton Park's grandstand burned down in 1953 and the stadium flooded completely in 2005 and again in 2015.\n\nBrunton Park is split into four separate stands; Warwick Road End, East Stand, Main (West) Stand and the Petteril End, which remains closed unless exceptionally large crowds are in attendance.\n\nBrunton Park is the largest football stadium in England which is not all-seated. Carlisle United plan to move away from Brunton Park in the near future to a 12,000 capacity all-seater stadium.\n\nBefore the 2012/13 season Cumbria County Council inspected Brunton Park and they deemed that certain areas of the stadium were unsafe. As a result, they reduced the capacity to 17,001 for the forthcoming season.\n\nIn 1904 Shaddongate United became Carlisle United F.C., an association football club who played at the Millholme Bank ground to the west of Carlisle. The ground was often too small for their purposes and they sometimes used the Rugby Ground which would later be the adjacent neighbour of Brunton Park. In 1905 United joined the Lancashire Combination league and required larger facilities so moved to Devonshire Park, a football ground which stood where Trinity School now sits. In 1909 they were evicted from premises by the Duke of Devonshire and moved eastwards to establish Brunton Park, the club's home ever since.\n\nIn 1953 the original wooden grandstand which sat where the Main Stand now sits was burned to the ground in a fire cause by an electrical fault. The sale of local player Geoff Twentyman to Liverpool for £12,500 enabled the club to rebuild the stadium into what is the West Stand today.\n\nOn the evening of Friday 7 January 2005, the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril burst their banks in Carlisle due to as much as 180mm rainfall landing up stream that day. The worst affected area was Warwick Road, where Brunton Park is situated.\n\nFor the following six weeks Carlisle United were forced to play their home games at Christie Park in Morecambe while repair work took place. United were still able, however, to reach the playoffs in the Conference that season and win promotion back into the Football League.\n\n\nThe Stadium was severely flooded following Storm Desmond. It caused the team to play fixtures at Preston's Deepdale Ground, Blackburn's Ewood Park and Blackpool's Bloomfield Road.\n\nIn November 2009 and November 2015, half the pitch and the match day car park were flooded but the stadium wasn't damaged. The match day car park is flooded a least once every year.\n\nThe West Stand, is a 6,000 capacity mixed terraced and seated area. It is regarded as the main stand at Brunton Park and on average receives the highest attendance of home fans. The stand accommodates the club's offices and changing rooms as well as media facilities for radio and television coverage.\n\nThe lower tier is mainly a paddock terrace which runs the length of the pitch. The home and away dugouts are situated in front of this stand with the tunnel dividing it through the centre. To the north is an area for disabled supporters\n\nThe upper tier is known as the family stand with a small section to the south known as the 'A' Stand which houses school children. The full extent of the upper tier is seated and is the location of the stadium's most recent improvements, upgraded seating which was bought from Darlington in 2006 during the club's move.\n\nAt the north end of the stand is also a viewing gallery positioned in-between the two tiers of the stand. The gallery sits in front of Foxy's restaurant which offers hospitality packages to supporters.\n\nThe most distinctive of the four stands at Brunton Park, a unique covered terrace with a triple triangle roof, it is situated at the southern end of the stadium. Although currently called the 'Newcastle International Airport End' under a sponsorship deal, it is still affectionately known as 'the Warwick' to most Carlisle fans. The stand has a capacity of 3,500 and usually houses the most vocal supporters on match day. In the event low crowds are expected this stand can be closed to the public.\n\nCurrently named the 'Pioneer Foods Stand', it is a 6,000 seater single-tiered cantilever stand. Although having been constructed a number of years ago, the club still have not completed the interior of the stand, thus the spaces at the top of the stand for executive boxes still stand empty. One peculiar thing fans may have noticed when visiting the ground is that the stand actually runs 20 yards past the goal line at the northern end of the pitch. This is because the club had erected the stand with a view of moving the pitch further northwards so a new stand at the southern end of the ground could also be built. These plans never materialised though, and the problem still stands today.\n\nThe north section of the East Stand most commonly houses the away fans, separated from the home fans by nets and a gate in the concourse. When large groups of home fans are expected away fans are sometimes restricted to the Petteril End.\n\nIn November 2010 local business and longtime supporters of the club the Stobart Group celebrated their 40th anniversary and bought 4,000 tickets on the East Stand for the League One fixture: Carlisle versus Rochdale. The company then gave away the tickets to the local public. On this occasion the away fans were moved solely to the Petteril End.\n\nThe Petteril is the only other uncovered stand in the ground alongside the lower tier paddock. The stand is a small capacity (2,000) terrace with a small seated area to the east. This stand usually remains closed unless exceptionally large crowds are expected.\n\nTo the west of the stand is a small control tower which is used to facilitate crowd supervision on match days. Also located here is the only scoreboard in the stadium and an advertising screen which sometimes displays goal replays.\n\nThe pitch at Brunton Park currently measures . Originally a soil-based pitch was housed which was built over a landfill site; over the years this caused numerous settlement problems such as dips and crowns. When Bill Shankly joined the club in 1949 he called the ground \"a glorified hen coop, everything was in terrible condition except for the pitch and that was always a good one\". The pitch was and still is laid with local Solway turf, which is favoured by Wimbledon and formerly Wembley Stadium before its renovation. The new Wembley Stadium was not laid with the turf and has since suffered multiple problems with its pitch.\n\nDuring the flooding of January 2005, heavy deposits of silt were left on the playing field and a decision was made by the owners to build a new pitch and install a new primary drainage system.\n\nThe stadium has on-site parking to the east and north of the ground as well as a smaller parking area to the west.

Many terms that some people view as offensive are not viewed as offensive by others, and even where some people are offended by certain terms, others may be offended by the replacement of such terms with what they consider to be euphemisms (e.g., \"differently abled\" or \"special needs\").

The people first stance advocates for saying \"people with disabilities\" instead of \"the disabled\" or \"a person who is deaf\" instead of \"a deaf person\". However, some advocate against this, saying it reflects a medical model of disability whereas \"disabled person\" is more appropriate and reflects the social model of disability.

The dorsal nerve cord is only one embryonic feature unique to all chordates, among the other four chordate features-- a notochord, a post-anal tail, an endostyle, and pharyngeal slits. The dorsal hollow nerve cord is a hollow cord dorsal to the notochord. It is formed from a part of the ectoderm that rolls, forming the hollow tube. This is important, as it distinguishes chordates from other animal phyla, such as Annelids and Arthropods, which have solid, ventral tubes. The process by which this is performed is called invagination. The cells essentially convolute into the body cavity, arranging themselves on the dorsal plane above the notochord, as mentioned above. The evolutionary explanation to this adaptation from a solid cord to hollow tube is unknown. In vertebrates, the dorsal nerve cord is modified into the central nervous system, which comprises the brain and spinal cord. \n\nDorsal means the \"back\" side, as opposed to ventral which is the \"belly\" side of an organism.\nIn bipedal organisms dorsal is the back and ventral is the front.\nIn organisms which walk on four limbs the dorsal surface is the top (back) and the ventral surface is the bottom (belly).\n\n"}
{"id": "2220218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220218", "title": "Kt/V", "text": "Kt/V\n\nIn medicine, Kt/V is a number used to quantify hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatment adequacy.\n\n\nIn the context of hemodialysis, Kt/V is a pseudo-dimensionless number; it is dependent on the pre- and post-dialysis concentration (see below). It is \"not\" the product of \"K\" and \"t\" divided by \"V\", as would be the case in a true dimensionless number. In peritoneal dialysis, it isn't dimensionless at all.\nIt was developed by Frank Gotch and John Sargent as a way for measuring the dose of dialysis when they analyzed the data from the National Cooperative Dialysis Study. In hemodialysis the US National Kidney Foundation \"Kt\"/\"V\" target is ≥ 1.3, so that one can be sure that the delivered dose is at least 1.2. In peritoneal dialysis the target is ≥ 1.7/week.\n\nDespite the name, \"Kt\"/\"V\" is quite different from standardized Kt/V.\n\n\"K\" (clearance) multiplied by \"t\" (time) is a volume (since mL/min × min = mL, or L/h × h = L), and (\"K\" × \"t\") can be thought of as the mL or L of fluid (blood in this case) cleared of urea (or any other solute) during the course of a single treatment. \"V\" also is a volume, expressed in mL or L. So the ratio of \"K\" × \"t\" / \"V\" is a so-called \"dimensionless ratio\" and can be thought of as a multiple of the volume of plasma cleared of urea divided by the distribution volume of urea. When Kt/V = 1.0, a volume of blood equal to the distribution volume of urea has been completely cleared of urea.\n\nThe relationship between \"Kt\"/\"V\" and the concentration of urea \"C\" at the end of dialysis can be derived from the first-order differential equation that describes exponential decay and models the clearance of any substance from the body where the concentration of that substance decreases in an exponential fashion:\n\nwhere\nFrom the above definitions it follows that formula_2 is the first derivative of concentration with respect to time, i.e. the change in concentration with time.\n\nThis equation is separable and can be integrated (assuming K and V are constant) as follows:\n\nAfter integration,\n\nwhere\n\nIf one takes the antilog of \"Equation 2b\" the result is:\n\nwhere\n\nBy integer exponentiation this can be written as:\n\nwhere\n\nThe above equation can also be written as\n\nNormally we measure postdialysis serum urea nitrogen concentration \"C\" and compare this with the initial or predialysis level \"C\". The session length or time is \"t\" and this is measured by the clock. The dialyzer clearance \"K\" is usually estimated, based on the urea transfer ability of the dialyzer (a function of its size and membrane permeability), the blood flow rate, and the dialysate flow rate. In some dialysis machines, the urea clearance during dialysis is estimated by testing the ability of the dialyzer to remove a small salt load that is added to the dialysate during dialysis.\n\nThe URR or Urea reduction ratio is simply the fractional reduction of urea during dialysis. So by definition, URR = 1 -\"C\"/\"C\". So 1-URR = \"C\"/\"C\". So by algebra, substituting into equation (4) above, since ln \"C\"/\"C\" = – ln \"C\"/\"C\", we get:\n\nPatient has a mass of 70 kg (154 lb) and gets a hemodialysis treatment that lasts 4 hours where the urea clearance is 215 mL/min.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\nThis means that if you dialyze a patient to a Kt/V of 1.23, and measure the postdialysis and predialysis urea nitrogen levels in the blood, then calculate the URR, then -ln (1-URR) should be about 1.23.\n\nThe math does not quite work out, and more complicated relationships have been worked-out to account for the fluid removal (ultrafiltration) during dialysis as well as urea generation (see urea reduction ratio). Nevertheless, the URR and Kt/V are so closely related mathematically, that their predictive power has been shown to be no different in terms of prediction of patient outcomes in observational studies.\n\nThe above analysis assumes that urea is removed from a single compartment during dialysis. In fact, this Kt/V is usually called the \"single-pool\" Kt/V. Due to the multiple compartments in the human body, a significant concentration rebound occurs following hemodialysis. \nUsually rebound lowers the Kt/V by about 15%. The amount of rebound depends on the rate of dialysis (K) in relation to the size of the patient (V). Equations have been devised to predict the amount of rebound based on the ratio of K/V, but usually this is not necessary in clinical practice. One can use such equations to calculate an \"equilibrated Kt/V\" or a \"double-pool Kt/V\", and some think that this should be used as a measure of dialysis adequacy, but this is not widely done in the United States, and the KDOQI guidelines (see below) recommend using the regular single pool Kt/V for simplicity.\n\n\"Kt\"/\"V\" (in the context of peritoneal dialysis) was developed by Michael J. Lysaght in a series of articles on peritoneal dialysis.\n\nThe steady-state solution of a simplified mass transfer equation that is used to describe the mass exchange over a semi-permeable membrane and models peritoneal dialysis is\n\nwhere\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\nThe mass generation (of urea), in steady state, can be expressed as the mass (of urea) in the effluent per time:\n\nwhere\n\nLysaght, motivated by \"Equations 6b\" and \"6c\", defined the value \"K\":\n\nLysaght uses \"ml/min\" for the clearance. In order to convert the above clearance (which is in m/s) to ml/min one has to multiply by 60 × 1000 × 1000.\n\nOnce \"K\" is defined the following equation is used to calculate \"Kt\"/\"V\":\n\nwhere\n\nThe 7/3 is used to adjust the \"Kt\"/\"V\" value so it can be compared to the \"Kt\"/\"V\" for hemodialysis, which is typically done thrice weekly in the USA.\n\nTo calculate the \"weekly Kt/V\" (for peritoneal dialysis) K has to be in litres/day.\nWeekly \"Kt\"/\"V\" is defined by the following equation:\n\nAssume:\n\nThen by \"Equation 6d\" \"K\" is: 1.3334e−07 m/s or 8.00 mL/min or 11.52 L/d.\n\nKt/V and the weekly Kt/V by \"Equations 7a\" and \"7b\" respectively are thus: 0.45978 and 1.9863.\n\nOn a practical level, in peritoneal dialysis the calculation of Kt/V is often relatively easy because the fluid drained is usually close to 100% saturated with urea, i.e. the dialysate has equilibriated with the body. Therefore, the daily amount of plasma cleared is simply the drain volume divided by an estimate of the patient's volume of distribution.\n\nAs an example, if someone is infusing four 2 liter exchanges a day, and drains out a total of 9 liters per day, then they drain 9 × 7 = 63 liters per week. If the patient has an estimated total body water volume V of about 35 liters, then the weekly Kt/V would be 63/35, or about 1.8.\n\nThe above calculation is limited by the fact that the serum concentration of urea is changing during dialysis. \nIn automated PD this change cannot be ignored; thus, blood samples are usually measured at some time point in the day and assumed to be representative of an average value. The clearance is then calculated using this measurement.\n\n\"Kt\"/\"V\" has been widely adopted because it was correlated with survival. Before \"Kt\"/\"V\" nephrologists measured the serum urea concentration (specifically the\ntime-averaged concentration of urea (TAC of urea)), which was found not to be correlated with survival (due to its strong dependence on protein intake) and thus deemed an unreliable marker of dialysis adequacy.\n\n\n\"Kt\"/\"V\" has been criticized because quite high levels can be achieved, particularly in smaller patients, during relatively short dialysis sessions. This is especially true for small people, where \"adequate\" levels of Kt/V often can be achieved over 2 to 2.5 hours. One important part of dialysis adequacy has to do with adequate removal of salt and water, and also of solutes other than urea, especially larger molecular weight substances and phosphorus. Phosphorus and similar molecular weights remain elusive to filtration of any degree. A number of studies suggest that a longer amount of time on dialysis, or more frequent dialysis sessions, lead to better results. There have been various alternative methods of measuring dialysis adequacy, most of which have proposed some number based on Kt/V and number of dialysis sessions per week, e.g., the standardized Kt/V, or simply number of dialysis sessions per week squared multiplied by the hours on dialysis per session; e.g. the hemodialysis product by Scribner and Oreopoulos It is not practical to give long dialysis sessions (greater than 4.5 hours) 3x/week in a dialysis center during the day. Longer sessions can be practically delivered if dialysis is done at home. Most experience has been gained with such long dialysis sessions given at night. Some centers are offering every-other-night or 3x/week nocturnal dialysis. The benefits of giving more frequent dialysis sessions is also an area of active study, and new easy-to-use machines are permitting easier use of home dialysis, where 2–3+ hour sessions can be given 4–7 days per week.\n\nOne question in terms of Kt/V is, how much is enough? The answer has been based on observational studies, and the NIH-funded HEMO trial done in the United States, and also, on kinetic analysis. \nFor a US perspective, see the and for a United Kingdom perspective see: According to the US guidelines, for 3x/week dialysis a Kt/V (without rebound) should be 1.2 at a minimum with a target value of 1.4 (15% above the minimum values). However, there is suggestive evidence that larger amounts may need to be given to women, smaller patients, malnourished patients, and patients with clinical problems. The recommended minimum Kt/V value changes depending on how many sessions per week are given, and is reduced for patients who have a substantial degree of residual renal function.\n\nFor a US perspective, see: For the United States, the minimum weekly Kt/V target used to be 2.0. This was lowered to 1.7 in view of the results of a large randomized trial done in Mexico, the ADEMEX trial, and also from reanalysis of previous observational study results from the perspective of residual kidney function.\n\nFor a United Kingdom perspective see: This is still in draft form.\n\n\n\n"}

This is particularly notable when the size and wealth of Scotland at the time are taken into account. They are free standing stone sculptures of the 17th and 18th centuries with many small dials inscribed on them. Accurate timetelling is clearly not the aim. Precision is sacrificed for decorative effective. Unlike the sundials of similar date on the continent where baroque decoration may be added, the mathematical complexity of the Scottish dials is decoration enough. The ancient sundials of Scotland can be grouped into three main styles: lectern, obelisk and facet-head.\n\nThese are noticeable for their sloping top like a reading desk or lectern, in the equatorial plane, usually with a star on top having dials in all its angles, and at 90 degrees to this a hemi-cylinder with a polar dial inscribed in it. The lectern usually has hollow dials on the south, east and west faces, and hour lines are inscribed in every available angle.\n\nOne of the more complicated was formerly at Mid Calder House and is now at Culzean Castle.\n\nLectern dials have some counterparts in continental Europe. This is particularly true of the Netherlands which was Scotland's primary trading partner of the time and where several lectern dials survive.\n\nObelisk dials are unique to Scotland and there are only 26 of them known.\nThe first is meant to be that at Drummond Castle. It was carved in 1630 by John Mylne the King's Master Mason.\n\nObelisk dials are made up of three parts. The base element is a square shaft with four or five square panels on each side. In these panels are often sunken dials of bowl-hollows, hearts or triangular and rectangular shapes. The middle element is an octangonal section boss. The corners may be cut away and have dials inscribed in the hollows. The crowning element is a square tapering finial which when viewed with the lower square shaft produces the obelisk appearance. This finial also has panelled sides with up to seven or eight on each side. There can be 70 or 80 surfaces in total available for dials.\n\nThis term includes a wide variety of other types ranging from a simple cube to complex polyhedrals. The most dramatic of these is at Glamis Castle.\n\nThe information here is heavily derived from the writings of Andrew Somerville who in turn used the pioneering Victorian writings of Thomas Ross.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2220239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220239", "title": "Amyraldism", "text": "Amyraldism\n\nAmyraldism (sometimes Amyraldianism) is also known as the School of Saumur, post redemptionism, moderate Calvinism, four-point Calvinism, or hypothetical universalism (though it is in fact one of several hypothetical universalist systems).\n\nIt is the belief that God decreed Christ's atonement, prior to his decree of election, for all alike if they believe, but he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, seeing that none would believe on their own, and thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.\n\nThis doctrine is named after its formulator Moses Amyraut, and is still viewed as a variety of Calvinism in that it maintains the particularity of sovereign grace in the application of the atonement. However, detractors such as B. B. Warfield have termed it \"an inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism.\"\n\nHypothetical universalist teachings may be found in the writings of early Reformed theologians including Heinrich Bullinger, Wolfgang Musculus, Zacharias Ursinus, and Girolamo Zanchi. Several theologians who signed the Canons of Dort were hypothetical universalists.\n\nMoses Amyraut, originally a lawyer, but converted to the study of theology by the reading of Calvin's 'Institutes', an able divine and voluminous writer, developed the doctrine of hypothetical or conditional universalism, for which his teacher, John Cameron (1580–1625), a Scot, and for two years Headmaster of Saumur Academy, had prepared the way. His object was not to set aside but to moderate Calvinism by ingrafting this doctrine upon the particularism of election, and thereby to fortify it against the objections of Roman Catholics, by whom the French Protestants, or Huguenots, were surrounded and threatened. Being employed by the Reformed Synod in important diplomatic negotiations with the government, he came in frequent contact with bishops, and with Cardinal Richelieu, who esteemed him highly. His system is an approach, not so much to Arminianism, which he decidedly rejected, as to Lutheranism, which likewise teaches a universal atonement and a limited election.\n\nAmyraut maintained the Calvinistic premises of an eternal foreordination and foreknowledge of God, whereby he caused all things to pass, the good efficiently, the bad permissively. He also admitted the double decree of election and reprobation, but his view on double predestination is modified slightly by his view of double election. He also taught that God foreordained a universal salvation through the universal sacrifice of Christ offered to all alike, on condition of faith, so that on the part of God's will and desire, the grace is universal, but as regards the condition it is particular, or only for those who do not reject it which would thereby make it ineffective.\n\nThe universal redemption scheme precedes the particular election scheme, and not vice versa. He reasons from the benevolence of God towards his creatures; the traditional Reformed presentation of predestination, he thought, improperly reasons from the result and makes facts interpret the decrees. Amyraut distinguished between objective grace which is offered to all, and subjective grace in the heart which is given only to the elect. He also makes a distinction between natural ability and moral ability, or the power to believe and the willingness to believe; man possesses the former but not the latter in consequence of inherent depravity. It, therefore, takes an act of God to illuminate the mind, thereby engaging the will towards action. He was disposed, like Huldrych Zwingli, to extend the grace of God beyond the limits of the visible Church, inasmuch as God by his general providence operates upon the heathen, as in the case of , and may produce in them a sort of unconscious Christianity, a faith without knowledge; while within the Church he operates more fully and clearly through the means of grace.\n\nThose who never heard of Christ are condemned if they reject the general grace of providence, but the same persons would also reject Christ if he were offered to them. As regards the result, Amyraut agreed with the particularists. His ideology is unavailable, except for those in whom God previously works the condition of faith: for those who are included in the particular decree of election.\n\nAmyraut's doctrine created a great commotion in the Reformed Churches of France, the Dutch Republic, and Switzerland. Jean Daillé (1594–1670), David Blondel (1591–1655), and others considered it innocent and consistent with the decrees of the Synod of Dort, where German Reformed and Anglican delegates professed similar views against the supralapsarianism of Gomarus. But Pierre Du Moulin (Molinæus) (since 1621 professor of the rival theological school of Sedan), Friedrich Spanheim (1600–49, Professor in Leiden), André Rivet (1572–1651, Professor in Leiden), and the theologians of Geneva opposed it.\n\nSimilar charges were leveled against the Puritan great, Richard Baxter, who dealt frequently with Cyrus and Peter du Moulin. In Geneva, the chief opponent of Amyraut's scheme was Francis Turretin (1623–87). Amyraut's teaching was not, however, considered to be heretical or outside the Reformed confessions by its opponents.\n\nThe friends of Amyraut urged the love, benevolence, and impartial justice of God as well as the numerous passages in Scripture which teach that God loves 'the whole world', that he will have 'all men to be saved', that Christ died 'not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world', that 'he shut up all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all'. On the other hand, it was objected that God does not really will and intend what is never accomplished; that he could not purpose an end without providing adequate means; God did not actually offer salvation to all; and that a hypothetical universalism based on an unlikely condition is an unfruitful abstraction.\n\nThe national Synods at Alençon, 1637; at Charenton, 1645; and at Loudun, 1659 (the last synod permitted by the French government), decided against the excommunication of Amyraut but delimited his views in order to avoid further variance with historic Reformed orthodoxy. He gave the assurance that he did not change the doctrine but only the method of instruction. His opponents allowed that the idea of a universal grace by which no one was actually saved unless included in the particular, effective decree of election, was permissible. In this way hypothetical universalism was sanctioned as a permissible view, along with the particularism that had characterized historic Reformed orthodoxy, and a schism in the French Church was avoided. The literary controversy continued for several years longer and developed a large amount of learning and ability, until it was brought to an abrupt close by the political oppressions of the Reformed Church in France.\n\nJohn Davenant (1576–1641), like Amyraut a student of John Cameron, was an English delegate at the Synod of Dort and influenced some of the members of the Westminster Assembly. He promoted \"hypothetical universalism, a general atonement in the sense of intention as well as sufficiency, a common blessing of the cross, and a conditional salvation. The \"root principle of the Davenant School\" was the \"notion of a universal desire in God for the salvation of all men.\" In the floor debate on redemption at the Westminster Assembly, Edmund Calamy the Elder of the Davenant School attempted to insert Amyraldism into the Catechism.\n\nRichard Baxter held to a form of Amyraldism, although he was less Calvinistic than Amyraut. He \"devised an eclectic middle route between Reformed, Arminian, and Roman doctrines of grace: interpreting the kingdom of God in terms of contemporary political ideas, he explained Christ's death as an act of universal redemption (penal and vicarious, but not substitutionary), in virtue of which God has made a new law offering pardon and amnesty to the penitent. Repentance and faith, being obedience to this law, are the believer's personal saving righteousness... the fruit of the seeds which Baxter sowed was neonomian Moderatism in Scotland and moralistic Unitarianism in England.\"\n\nPopularised in England by the Reformed pastor Richard Baxter, Amyraldism also gained strong adherence among the Congregationalists and some Presbyterians in the American colonies, during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nIn the United States, Amyraldism can be found among various evangelical groups, such as Southern Baptists, the Evangelical Free Church of America, the dispensationalists in independent Bible Churches and independent Baptist churches. In Australia, many in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney hold to a modified \"four point\" Calvinism, while in England, one author, Dr Alan Clifford, pastor of the Norwich Reformed Church, tirelessly promotes Amyraldism in self-published pamphlets such as \"Amyraut Affirmed\". Yet \"Five point\" Calvinism remains prevalent especially in more conservative groups among the Reformed and Presbyterian churches, Reformed Baptists, among evangelical Anglicans in England and in some non-denominational evangelical churches.\n\nAmyraldism has come under fire in recent years by contemporary Calvinist theologians who argue that one simply cannot accept that Christ died for all people in the world if not all are saved. That belief either requires a second payment for sin at the judgment, the adoption of a form of universal reconciliation, or abandonment of the penal substitution theory of the atonement.\n\nReformed theologian, pastor, and author R.C. Sproul suggested there is confusion about what the doctrine of limited atonement actually teaches. While he considered it possible for a person to believe four points without believing the fifth, he claimed that a person who really understands the other four points \"must\" believe in limited atonement because of what Martin Luther called a resistless logic.\n\n"}

The design was developed from the NA-16/BT-9 basic training aircraft of 1935. The NA-16 evolved into a series of aircraft that were some of the most widely used advanced and basic training aircraft produced by any country, and provided the basic design for a single-engined fighter intended for small countries that needed a simple aircraft with modern capabilities and features.\n\nThe NA-50 \"Torito\" (Spanish slang for \"little bull\"), built for Peru, was a single-seat fighter design based on the two-seat Basic Combat Demonstrator NA-44.

As of 2018, it is commanded by Vice-Amiral d’Escadre Jean-Philippe Rolland.\n\nThe ships are divided into seven categories:\n\nThe aeronaval group is the main French Navy power projection force. It is also one of the components of the nuclear deterrence forces, since the embarked Super Étendard and Rafale planes have nuclear capabilities.\n\nAt minimum, it contains an aircraft carrier (currently ), an anti-air frigate, and a support vessel. Typically, this group also includes several anti-air and anti-submarine frigates, nuclear attack submarine ( and the future Barracuda-class submarines), and possibly additional support ships.\n\nThe carrier air group can include up to 40 aircraft: Rafale, Super Étendard and E-2 Hawkeye planes; NH-90 Caïman Marine, AS365 Dauphin and AS565 Panther for the helicopters. This composition varies according to the mission and the tactical environment, and can include aircraft of the \"ALAT\" (Army) or the \"Armée de l'Air\" (Air Force).\n\nLike any naval force, the aeronaval group can be assisted by land-based Breguet Atlantique aircraft.\n\n\"Clemenceau\" formed the core of the French Navy's battle force for many years.\n\nOne of the aeronaval group's deployments was to take part in the initial attacks on Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan as part of what became the War in Afghanistan, in response to the September 11th attacks. The group, designated Task Force 473 for the operation, comprised 2,900 men under the command of Contre-Amiral François Cluzel and sailed in December 2001. It consisted of the nuclear aircraft carrier \"Charles De Gaulle\", frigates , , , the nuclear attack submarine , the tanker , and the . The Indian Ocean region deployment lasted for seven months before the group returned to France in mid-2002.\n\nThe number 473 seems to be semi-permanently assigned to \"Charles de Gaulle\" and its task group, being used again during Operation Agapanthe in 2004.\n\nDuring the 2011 Libyan civil war, the French carrier battle group commanded from \"Charles de Gaulle\" was designated Task Force 473 and was under the command of Vice-Admiral Phillippe Coindreau. Coindreau was promoted to contre-amiral in September 2009, and he was named deputy commandant of the aéro-maritime force of rapid réaction at Toulon. In English-language reports, he was described as deputy commander of the High Readiness Force Maritime Headquarters.\n\nOn 29 December 2013, Task Force 473, led by the aircraft carrier \"Charles de Gaulle\", and comprising the destroyer , frigate \"Jean de Vienne\", and the replenishment oiler \"Meuse\" met Carrier Strike Group Ten for an exercise in the Gulf of Oman. Carrier Strike Group Ten comprises the aircraft carrier , guided-missile cruisers and and guided-missile destroyers , , , and .\n\nIn November 2015, Task Force 473 sailed again to strike Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. The composition of the task force is French, however, the British destroyer and a frigate from the Belgian Navy, , sailed as part of the group.\n\nThe French Navy operates three large amphibious ships, which contain smaller landing craft. Aboard are helicopters, troops, and land vehicles (three amphibious assault ships).\n\nThis force also operates five smaller craft which are based in Fort de France, Toulon, Papeete, Nouméa, and La Réunion.\n\nThe amphibious groups include one or several landing craft (EDAR and CTM) which allow the projection of inter-arm groups with troops, vehicles and helicopters, and one or several light transport ships (\"bâtiments de transport léger\", BATRAL) which carry motorised infantry companies up to the beaches themselves. They can carry Puma, Cougar and NH-90 Caïman Marine transport helicopters or Gazelle and Tigre combat helicopters, the \"Commandos Marine\", minesweeping units, or Army units.\n\nCommander French Maritime Forces (COMFRMARFOR) advises ALFAN, the Admiral in command of the Naval Action Force, and when operational at sea commands from the TCDs.\n\nThe destroyers and frigates are the backbone of the French surface fleet. They secure aero-naval space and allow free action to the other components of the Navy. They are specialised according to the threat, typically escorting other forces (aeronaval or amphibious groups, submarines or civil ships).\n\n\nThe minesweepers secure major French harbours, especially for the ballistic-missile submarines in Brest, and the attack submarines in Toulon. They also stay available to secure access to Toulon, Marseille, any of the harbours of the Atlantic coast, and any Allied harbour simultaneously.\n\nThey are designed to be used within a larger group, interallied or international, in case of mine risks near coasts.\n\nIn peacetime, these units can bring help and assistance to civilian ships, or search wrecks.\n\nThis force includes 1,100 men and:\n\nThese 65 vessels (as of 2019) patrol harbors, territorial waters, and the world's second largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), including enforcing fishing, environmental, and criminal laws, and conducting or supporting recovery operations.\n\nSix s perform sovereignty tasks, mainly by controlling the large French EEZ, carrying out police action, and monitoring fishing activities. They operate in low-risk environments. All six are based overseas (two at Réunion, two at Martinique, one in French Polynesia, and one in New Caledonia)\n\n\nThe A-69 avisos were originally designed to counter conventional submarines, especially in coastal defence. Instead of decommissioning all 17 as planned, by 2011, nine were stripped of heavy weaponry and converted to offshore patrol vessel (\"Patrouilleur de haute-mer\" or PHM). While based in metropolitan France, they conduct routine deployments to the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, replacing eight of the original P 400-class OPVs. As of 2019, seven of the PHMs remain in service, with replacements under construction to be based in Reunion, in the Pacific, and in metropolitan France.\n\nThree \"Patrouilleur Antilles Guyane\" (PAG), based in French Guiana and Martinique, are larger and more capable of the offshore patrol mission than the P 400s.\n\nThree unique patrol vessels (\"Le Malin\" at Réunion, \"Arago\" for French Polynesia, and \"Fulmar\" for Saint Pierre and Miquelon) conduct inshore patrol missions in their respective areas.\n\nThe patrol boats of the \"Gendarmerie Maritime\" carry out law enforcement operations primarily in ports and coastal waters. These include six coastal patrol boats (\"Patrouilleur côtier de Gendarmerie maritime\" or PCGM), based in Cherbourg (2), Lorient, Toulon, Guadeloupe, and French Polynesia. There are twenty-four coastal surveillance launches (\"vedette côtière de surveillance maritime\"), nineteen deployed around metropolitan France and five deployed overseas, generally responding to both maritime and departmental prefects for law enforcement in coastal waters. Eight launches (\"vedette de sûreté maritime et portuaire\"), are located in Le Havre, Cherbourg, Brest, Marseilles, and Toulon.\n\nFour overseas support and assistance vessels (\"bâtiments de soutien et d'assistance outre-mer\") of the have been constructed and deployed to New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Réunion, and Martinique.\n\nTwo of four planned home support and assistance vessels (\"bâtiments de soutien et d'assistance métropolitains\") of the \"Loire\" class have been constructed and deployed to Brest and Toulon (with two in each port when the last two are completed).\n\nThe four support ships allow the French naval forces to be present anywhere on the planet, regardless of the remoteness of their bases. These ships operate independently or are integrated into tactical groups. They shuttle between harbours and fleets, giving them months of operational capabilities by feeding fuel, ammunition, food, water, spare parts and mail. There is also one permanent mechanics ship, \"Jules Verne\", which can repair other ships. The spy ship \"Dupuy de Lôme\" is used for intelligence gathering and the tracking ship is used to develop new weapon systems, especially those related to nuclear deterrence.\n\nOne hydro-oceanographic and three hydrographic ships help carrying out mapping and research operations, as well as gathering intelligence which could prove useful to the deployment of naval forces and their weapon systems. They are operated by the \"service hydrographique et océanographique de la marine\" (SHOM).\n\n"}

It was originally released in September 28, 1983, on the label Warner Bros.. \"DaDa\" would be Cooper's last album until his sober re-emergence in 1986 with the album \"Constrictor\". The album's theme is ambiguous, however, ongoing themes in the songs' lyrics suggest that the main character in question, Sonny, suffers from mental illness, resulting in the creation of many different personalities. The album alludes strongly to the dadaist movement. Its cover was based on a painting by surrealist artist Salvador Dalí titled \"Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\". Produced by long-time collaborator Bob Ezrin, at the time his first production with Cooper in six years, \"DaDa\" was recorded at ESP Studios in Buttonville, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\"DaDa\" peaked at No. 93 in the UK but failed to dent the US \"Billboard\" Top 200. \"I Love America\" was released as a single solely in the UK over a month after the album's release.\n\nGuitarist and co-songwriter Dick Wagner revealed in 2014 that Cooper had relapsed to drinking heavily during the recording of \"DaDa\", and had suggested that the album was a contract fulfillment requirement for which Warner Bros. was not pleased and consequently made no effort to promote, though Warner Bros. has never confirmed or denied this. This and other details, like the real-life cocktail waitresses that inspired \"Scarlet and Sheba\" are in his autobiography \"Not Only Women Bleed\".\n\nCooper reportedly has no recollection of recording \"DaDa\", or the preceding albums \"Special Forces\" and \"Zipper Catches Skin\", due to substance abuse. Cooper stated \"I wrote them, recorded them and toured them and I don't remember much of any of that\", though he toured only \"Special Forces\". In 1996 Cooper said that \"DaDa\" was the scariest album he ever made, and that he never had any idea what it was about. There was no tour to promote \"DaDa\", and none of its songs have ever been played live.\n\n\"DaDa\" was Cooper’s final album for his long-time label Warner Bros., and after its release he took a three-year hiatus from the music industry.\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n\"DaDa\" is cited as the main inspiration behind the birth of the Italian Dark/Shock Rock band the Mugshots, the first ever European band produced by Dick Wagner, who is also featured on \"Love, Lust And Revenge\". That EP contains the first cover ever recorded of \"Pass the Gun Around\", a live favourite for the Mugshots.\n"}

It is about an American middle class, suburban family that is torn apart when the youngest son is kidnapped and raised by a mentally ill woman, until he appears at the front doorstep of his real mother and asks if he can mow the lawn.\n\nWisconsin photographer and housewife Beth Cappadora leaves her youngest son, Ben, alone with his older brother for a brief moment in a crowded Chicago hotel lobby, while attending her high school reunion. The older son lets go of Ben's hand and Ben vanishes without a trace. Beth goes into an extended mental breakdown and it is left to her husband and owner of a restaurant, Pat, to force his wife to robotically care for their remaining two children, 7-year-old Vincent and infant daughter Kerry.\n\nNine years later a young boy named Sam asks Beth if she needs the lawn mowed. Beth suspects that this boy who lives with his \"father\" two blocks away is in fact her lost son, and while Sam mows the lawn, she takes photographs of him to show to her husband and teenage son, who then says that he suspected the boy's true identity all along. The parents contact Detective Candy Bliss who pops in to offer wise, albeit often cryptic and conflicting, advice to Beth. It is learned that at the reunion in Chicago, the celebrity alumna Cecil Lockhart kidnapped Ben, renamed him Sam, and raised him as her own child until she was committed to a mental hospital, leaving Sam to be raised in a house only two blocks from the Cappadoras, by his adoptive father, the sensitive and intellectual George Karras.\n\nBen was raised by a Greek-American father for nine years, while his biological parents are Italian-American. Ben is a polite, intelligent American boy who takes great pride in participating in Greek cultural rituals, much to the frustration of Pat who wants to pretend that Ben was never really abducted. Ben is faced with the cultural identity that he grew up with, and the cultural identity he would have known had he not been kidnapped.\n\nBen's adoptive father agrees to surrender Ben to his birth family, while still living two blocks away. Torn between two worlds and having lost both of the parents that he knew, Ben expresses suicidal feelings to Beth.\n\nBen's only memory of his biological family is one of brother Vincent and thus over a one-on-one basketball game he absolves his brother of any responsibility for his abduction, and agrees to return to live with the Cappadoras.\n\nAt the end of the novel, many conflicts remain unresolved. Pat still has problems loving his sons: Ben because he can not relate to his personality and Vincent because he does not connect his teenage rebellion and cynicism to nine years of bad parenting. Beth has regained her position in the family as an equal parent, but Ben and Vincent's emotional scars may require years of intense therapy.\n\nAside from ethnicity, there is an underlined theme in the story about women's empowerment as Beth awakens from her nine-year depression to argue with Pat about how to deal with Ben's dual-ethnic and family identity. Once Beth finds Ben she also finds her own inner strength, and argues with Pat about the terms that Ben must obey in order to become integrated into the family. Pat wants Ben to abandon what he thought was his name, ethnic identity, and his father. Beth wants her son to be happy and feels that forcing Ben to abandon the past nine years of his life will only drive him away, both physically and emotionally.\n\nVincent sees the presence of Ben as a symbol of his own guilt at allowing his younger brother to be kidnapped, and a symbol of the anger that he has built up over the past nine years in living with parents that were too caught up in their grief to give him the love and attention that he needed. His younger sister seems the most well-adjusted of the children, but that is because she was too young to remember Ben. Vincent and Pat filled in the role as parents when Beth was trapped in her depression.\n\n\nThe novel was the first Oprah Book Club selection in September 1996. ()\n\nThere was a 1999 film of the same name based on the novel. The film is rated PG-13 for some profanity, and drama. It stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams. This was Ryan Merriman's first feature film role.\n\n"}
{"id": "2220265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220265", "title": "Pre-kindergarten", "text": "Pre-kindergarten\n\nPre-kindergarten (also called Pre-K or PK) is a voluntary classroom-based preschool program for children below the age of five in the United States, Canada, Turkey and Greece (when kindergarten starts). It may be delivered through a preschool or within a reception year in elementary school. Pre-kindergartens play an important role in early childhood education. They have existed in the US since 1922, normally run by private organizations. The U.S. Head Start program, the country's first federally funded pre-kindergarten program, was founded in 1967. This attempts to prepare children (especially disadvantaged children) to succeed in school.\n\nPre-kindergartens differentiate themselves from other child care by \"equally\" focusing on building a child's social development, physical development, emotional development, and cognitive development. They commonly follow a set of organization-created teaching standards in shaping curriculum and instructional activities and goals. The term \"preschool\" more accurately approximates the name \"pre-kindergarten\", for both focus on harvesting the same four child development areas in subject-directed fashion. The term \"preschool\" often refers to such schools that are owned and operated as private or parochial schools. Pre-kindergartens refer to such school classrooms that function within a public school under the supervision of a public school administrator and funded completely by state or federally allocated funds, and private donations.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics reports that the percentage of U.S. three-, four-, and five-year olds enrolled in pre-primary programs (including kindergarten and preschool programs) has stayed roughly stable from 2000 to 2017. U.S. participation rates in 2017 were 40% for three-year-olds, 68% for four year olds, and 86% for five-year olds.\n\nAs of 2016-17, a total of 44 states, plus the District of Columbia, provide at least some state funding for pre-K programs. Nine states (Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Oklahoma, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) plus D.C. include pre-K funding in their school funding formulas. Conversely, as of 2016-17, six states (Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming) provide no state funding for pre-K.\n\nIn 2013, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, and the city of San Antonio, Texas, enacted or expanded pre-K programs. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on a pledge of Pre-K for all city children. A poll conducted in 2014 for an early education nonprofit advocate found that 60 percent of registered Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats supported expanding public preschool by raising the federal tobacco tax.\n\nFunding for Pre-K has proven a substantial obstacle for creating and expanding programs. The issue produced multiple approaches. Several governors and mayors targeted existing budgets. San Antonio increased sales taxes, while Virginia and Maine look to gambling. In Oregon, currently 20% of kids have access to publicly funded Pre-K of any kind, and a 2016 campaign is working to fully fund Pre-K to 12 education, for all kids whose parents want them to have the option of Pre-K.\n\nA 2012 review by the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University identified Oklahoma, Georgia and West Virginia as among the leaders in public program quality and fraction of enrolled children. Florida had the highest enrollment in 2012 — almost four-fifths of all four-year-olds. About 84 percent were in private, religion-based or family centers. That state's preschool programs did not fare well on quality measures. Other states with more than 50 percent enrollment included Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas and Vermont.\n\nIn 2002, Florida voters enacted a state constitutional amendment requiring that the state establish a free voluntary pre-kindergarten (VPK) program for all four-year-old children by fall 2005. Florida's program is the largest state-level preschool program in the nation. It is universal, meaning that all children are eligible so long as they meet the age and residency requirement. In the 2013-14 school year, 80% of VPK programs were housed at private centers, 18% were housed at public schools, 1% were housed at family daycares, and 1% were housed at private schools. The program resulted in an increase in pre-k participation, which was about 80% in 2014. The program has suffered a decline in finding; in 2019, the \"Orlando Sentinel\" editorial board wrote that the Florida Legislature \"has neglected the pre-K program almost since it was approved by voters.\"\n\nA 2018 study in the \"Journal of Public Economics\" found in Italy that pre-kindergarten \"increased mothers' participation in the labor market and lowered the reservation wage of the unemployed, thus increasing their likelihood of finding a job\" but \"did not affect children's cognitive development, irrespective of their family background.\" A randomized control found that children randomly assigned to undertake full-day pre-K had substantially greater outcomes in cognition, literacy, math, and physical development than their peers who were randomly assigned to undertake half-day pre-K.\n\nThe US Census Bureau forecast that the foreign-born population in the United States would make up 19% of the US population by 2060 (up from 13% in 2014). Children of immigrant families face special challenges.\n\nChildren of immigrants represent the fastest growing US population. Asians and Latinos are the two largest racial groups. Like all families, immigrants have choices when pursuing childcare options. Cultural differences shape childcare choices, such as attitudes towards early academic development. These differences help explain certain irregular childcare options. Compared to Latino immigrant groups, Asians are more likely than Latinos to enroll their children in pre-kindergarten programs due to the inclusion of academics. The focus of pre-academic, school readiness is important to Asian parents. Latino immigrant parents by contrast generally opt for more informal childcare options, such as parental, relative or non-relative in-home care. This is due in part to the opinion that academic skills are to be taught through formal instruction after children enter primary school. While Latino families value the acquisition of academic skills, the in-home childcare choice is a reflection of the importance of cultural and linguistic values and traditional family dynamics. Parents with limited English proficiency are more likely to choose parental or in-home care instead of pre-kindergarten programs.\n\nAccording to information from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), low-income immigrant families are less likely to use center-based childcare, such as pre-kindergarten, than children of non-immigrants. While some Latino families prefer in-home childcare, many report wanting to enroll their children in a pre-kindergarten program. Interviews with immigrant mothers revealed common motivations for seeking pre-kindergarten placements for their children, including maternal employment, opportunity to learn English and social and emotional development. Obstacles immigrant mothers reported facing included high cost, long wait-lists, a need to provide documentation (especially for illegal aliens and those who lacked English-language proficiency) and a lack of information regarding eligibility for subsidized programs. On average, immigrants tend to experience higher poverty rates due to low wages, less education and a lack of English proficiency.\n\nWhile few children would benefit from pre-kindergarten and early childhood education, immigrant children, particularly those from lower socio-economic households, stand to benefit the most. Studies indicate that first and second generation immigrants lag behind children of non-immigrant families in cognitive and language skills. Pre-K's focus on cognitive, social, emotional and physical development would address these skills and reduce the inequalities in school readiness between children from immigrant and non-immigrant families. Educators must be sensitive to sensitivities of immigrant groups regarding the acquisition of the English language versus their native-language. Pre-K could help children build either or both skills. For most US students, English fluency is essential.\n\n\n"}

Its invention is generally attributed to chef Ed LaDou, and Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California. Wolfgang Puck, after meeting LaDou, popularized the style of pizza in the rest of the country. It is served in a number of California Cuisine restaurants. Such restaurant chains as California Pizza Kitchen, Round Table Pizza, Extreme Pizza, and Sammy's Woodfired Pizza are four major pizza franchises associated with California-style pizza.\n\nCalifornia-style pizza was invented more or less simultaneously in 1980 by Ed LaDou (the \"Prince of Pizza\"), then working as pizza chef for Spectrum Foods' Prego Restaurant in San Francisco's Cow Hollow neighborhood, and by pizza chefs working for Alice Waters at the Chez Panisse cafe in Berkeley, California.\n\nLaDou had learned pizza-making in the 1970s as a teenager at Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too, a traditional New York-style pizzeria in Mountain View, California. He made pizzas briefly at Ecco, an upscale restaurant at the Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto, California, before starting at Prego. Although Prego specialized in classic, Italian-style thin crust pizzas, its chefs encouraged LaDou to experiment with prosciutto, goat cheese, and truffles in their wood-burning oven, and send his results to guests. At one table, to whom he served an off-menu invention involving mustard, ricotta, pâté and red pepper turned out to be chef Wolfgang Puck.\n\nBy 1980, Alice Waters' Chez Panisse and its head chef, Jeremiah Tower, had already invented California cuisine, a combination of French and Italian techniques and presentation with fresh local ingredient-focused flavors. Waters was a long-time fan of Tommasso's Italian restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach, which had installed the West Coast's first wood-fired pizza oven when it opened in 1935. After traveling to Italy, Waters decided to make an open kitchen featuring a Tomasso's-style pizza oven the focus of the new cafe she was opening above her main dining room. Although prepared in classic fashion, her chefs added exotic fine ingredients to their single-serving pizzas and calzones, such as goat cheese and duck sausage. Her cafe, and its pizzas in particular, were an instant success, attracting wide attention among food critics.\n\nWolfgang Puck, in 1980 and 1981, was preparing to open the restaurant that would make him famous, Spago, in West Hollywood, California. Initially conceived as a pizzeria, Spago's was modeled after the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse. He was so impressed with the pizza LaDou had made for him at Prego, he hired LaDou as head pizza chef. Under Puck's guidance, LaDou developed more than 250 pizza concepts using ingredients such as scallops, roe, and baby zucchini flowers. Among their most famous invention was \"Jewish pizza\", a pizza dough first cooked then topped with smoked salmon, crème fraîche, capers, and dill. Another innovation was using infused olive oil, baby vegetables, chili oil, and flavored dough.\n\nIn 1985 LaDou helped two inexperienced lawyer-restaurateurs, Richard L. Rosenfeld and Larry S. Flax, start a new restaurant concept, California Pizza Kitchen (also known as \"CPK\"). He brought them many of Spago's recipes, which he had carefully saved. The new restaurant borrowed the concept of open kitchens centered around wood-burning pizza ovens from Spago, but instead of exotic gourmet ingredients it used innovative but simpler comfort food toppings. When the new restaurant's chef quit less than a month before opening, LaDou quickly designed and cooked an entire menu, inventing the now-ubiquitous barbecue chicken pizza on the spot. LaDou also helped develop pizza menus for Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and the Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nBoth Wolfgang Puck and California Pizza Kitchen were instrumental in turning California-style pizza from a gourmet food trend to a mass consumer food product. Based on the success of his pizzas and his status as a celebrity chef, Puck opened a series of restaurants, ranging from high end clones of Spago, to convenience chains for airports and mall food courts. California Pizza Kitchen grew to 200 outlets. Both introduced frozen pizzas, but after an early success Puck's supermarket lines were overtaken by CPK's, which are backed by Kraft foods.\n"}

In addition to keeping the image steady which allows for finer details of the object to be discerned, the use of the stick reduces muscle strain thus enabling longer viewing with less sore muscles afterwards. Some birdwatchers feel that the use of a finnstick does not markedly improve the viewer's ability to resolve detail, but rather improves viewing comfort and prevents premature fatigue.\n\nThe finnstick is especially useful when watching migration (e.g. seabirds, raptors) when the horizon may be scanned literally for hours to find migrant birds.\n\nAs the name implies the stick was invented by the Finns but is now also used in other countries, mainly in Europe. Alternative strategies for steadying the binoculars include supporting the arms against the body.\n\nSome birdwatchers have extended the idea by using a telescoping stick either as a finnstick or a monopod, depending on the situation.\n\nA simple finnstick can be made from a piece of wood such as an old hockey stick, or from the leg of an old tripod.

It was first published in 1982, illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky.\n\nA film adaptation was broadcast in the ABC Weekend Special series in 1991.\n\nRalph has befriended a young boy named Ryan, the son of the inn's new housekeeper. Ryan has given Ralph the full name of \"Ralph S. Mouse\", the middle initial standing for \"Smart\". Meanwhile, Ralph becomes agitated at his family, because he doesn't want them riding his motorcycle. Worried that their droppings on the floor will result in anti-mouse retaliation by the hotel staff, he asks Ryan to take him to school, where he plans to hide and live out the rest of his life. \n\nRalph is discovered by Ryan's classmates, who adopt him as a class pet, and decide to see how smart he is by building a maze for him to run through. All this time, Ryan is having difficulty with an aggressive boy named Brad from his class, who accidentally breaks Ralph's motorcycle, and Ralph blames Ryan and runs away to hide in the school. However, Ralph also confronts Brad for breaking his motorcycle, and Brad, realizing that Ralph can talk, offers to set things right for both him and Ryan. Ryan and Brad discover that they have much in common, and become friends. \n\nRyan reclaims Ralph, and brings him home on the school bus on the day that his new friend comes with him to visit at the inn.

Calspan consists of four primary operating units: Flight Research, Transportation Research, Aerospace Sciences [Transonic Wind Tunnel], and Crash Investigations. The company's main facility is in Cheektowaga, New York, while it has other facilities such as the Flight Research Center in Niagara Falls, New York, and remote flight test operations at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and Patuxent River, Maryland. Calspan also has thirteen field offices throughout the Eastern United States which perform accident investigations on behalf of the United States Department of Transportation.\n\nThe facility was started as a private defense contractor in the home front of World War II. As a part of its tax planning in the wake of the war effort, Curtiss-Wright donated the facility to Cornell University to operate \"as a public trust\" and received a charitable tax deduction. Seven other east coast aircraft companies also donated $675,000 to provide working capital for the lab.\n\nThe lab operated under the name Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory from 1946 until 1972. During this same time, Cornell formed a new Graduate School of Aerospace Engineering on its Ithaca, New York campus. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities came under criticism for conducting war-related research particularly as the Vietnam War became unpopular, and Cornell University tried to sever its ties. Similar laboratories at other colleges, such as the Lincoln Laboratory and Draper Laboratory at MIT came under similar criticism, but some labs, such as Lincoln, retained their collegiate ties. Cornell accepted a $25 million offer from EDP Technology, Inc. to purchase the lab in 1968. However, a group of lab employees who had made a competing $15 million offer organized a lawsuit to block the sale. In May 1971, New York's highest court ruled that Cornell had the right to sell the lab. At the conclusion of the suit, EDP Technology could not raise the money, and in 1972, Cornell reorganized the lab as the for-profit \"Calspan Corporation\" and then sold its stock in Calspan to the public.\n\nCalspan was the first in a series of corporate owners that have included Arvin Industries, Space Industries International, Veridian Corporation and General Dynamics.\n\nIn 2005, Calspan Corporation was returned to independent ownership when a local management group purchased the Aeronautics and Transportation Testing Groups of the Western New York operation from General Dynamics.\n\nUnder the name of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory were inventions of the first crash test dummy in 1948, the automotive seat belt in 1951, the first mobile field unit with Doppler weather radar for weather-tracking in 1956, the first accurate airborne simulation of another aircraft (the North American X-15) in 1960, the first successful demonstration of an automatic terrain-following radar system in 1964, the first use of a laser beam to successfully measure gas density in 1966, the first independent HYGE sled test facility to evaluate automotive restraint systems in 1967, the mytron, an instrument for research on neuromuscular behavior and disorders in 1969, and the prototype for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's fingerprint reading system in 1972.

These three remaining schools joined three nearby schools from Miami County and began the new Howard-Miami Conference. The conference renamed itself the Tri-County Conference in 1955, as two schools from Grant County joined.

{"id": "2220337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220337", "title": "Gaviotas", "text": "Gaviotas\n\nGaviotas is an ecovillage located in the llanos of the Colombian department of Vichada. It was founded in 1971 by Paolo Lugari who assembled a group of engineers and scientists in an attempt to create a mode of sustainable living in one of the least hospitable political and geographical climates in South America.\n\nThe community has produced a number of inventions and innovations over the years – notably including a children's seesaw that drives a water pump and a \"distinctive 'sunflower' design\" windmill that is well-suited to the plains in Colombia. Lugari notes that social experiments cannot simply import solutions from temperate climates. Gaviotas has made it a goal to always engineer solutions specific to the problems the community will be facing personally (Gaviotas Rising 1994).\n\nSince already-existing solutions are often very costly to adapt, Gaviotas' innovations are often simple changes to a means of production that make otherwise expensive products available at affordable prices. One of the most widespread Gaviotas developments is a water pump that can tap aquifers six times as deep as conventional pumps with less effort being expended. While existing pumps in the region raised and lowered a heavy piston in a pipe, the Gaviotas engineers created pumps that leave the piston in place and instead lift and lower a cheap, light PVC sleeve around the piston (Weisman 1995).\n\nWhen leading solar hot water panel manufacturers explained the expenses and complicated manufacture of panels efficient enough to collect sunlight in the often overcast weather of the llanos, the Gaviotas engineers crafted homemade solar water-heating panels out of cheap building materials that were better suited to the peculiar climate of the region. The ecovillage also creates some of its own building materials like a unique form of quickcrete brick made with the dirt of the region.\n\nIn the spring of 1998, Alan Weisman, the author of the book \"Gaviotas\" came and visited the students of Communications Arts High School in San Antonio, Texas, in what would later become known as 'Gaviotas Day.'\n\nThe Gaviotas crew created a self-powered, functional hospital in 1980 which treated a substantial number of indigenous people who worked in the village as well as those in the outlying plains until the Colombian government passed legislation pressuring the hospital to close its doors in the 1990s. While the hospital is no longer operational, the application of Gaviotas pump technology in the surrounding region has increased the availability of clean water and is a reportedly effective form of disease prevention as long as the locals maintain the pumps (Weisman 1999).\n\nIt is estimated that, in pre-Columbian times, the llanos were an extension of the Amazonian rain forest, but the rainforest border has been receding from the area for centuries. The Gaviotas village is noted for the planting of over 1.5 million trees in the area. While the trees were originally part of an experiment to see if any significant growth could occur in the desiccated soil of the llanos, they have become a significant feature of the grasslands. As a result of the shade these trees provide and the tropical climate of the area, the groundcover began hosting tropical rainforest species which are native to the region. Resin harvested from the planted trees has provided Gaviotas with a sustainable source of income.\n\nWhile the village is largely self-sufficient, it regularly uses diesel fuel during certain seasons. Currently, a BioDiesel project is under way for market and local use.\n\nGaviotas' pragmatic approach to its survival disassociates the village from many philosophies and political ideologies. Originally, the project received funding from the United Nations and similar groups seeking environmentally friendly solutions to population growth and Third World development.\n\nWhen these original donors began to pull funding from Gaviotas in the 1990s, the villagers looked elsewhere for their income. They realized that the impressive pine forest was a sustainable source of pine resin used in the production of a wide variety of products like turpentine and violins.\n\nTheir terraformation of the llanos allows Gaviotas to thrive, but it is not an example of low impact ecology practiced by many eco-villages. Gaviotas is largely apolitical, a strategy which has allowed it to grow amidst the cocaine growers, paramilitary and insurgent guerrilla groups, and military troops present in the llanos. The village is further separated from many eco-anarchist movements because of its early ties to the United Nations and the Colombian government.\n\n\n\n"}

The Institute also includes clerical oblates, who go through formation but are not ordained as priests, and who help in the several apostolates of the Institute.\n\nThe charism of the institute is based on the example of its three patron saints:\n\nThe institute also honors as its primary patroness the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception. St. Thérèse of the Child Jesus is the patroness of its African missions.\n\nIn the United States, the institute is located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, with its national headquarters in Chicago. In Chicago, the institute is restoring the historic St. Clara/St. Gelasius Church on Carmelite Way. Upon completion it will become the Shrine of Christ the King. \n\nIts oldest United States apostolate is St. Mary Oratory in Rockford, Illinois, and its newest is Most Precious Blood of Jesus parish in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In Kansas City, Missouri, in 2005, Bishop Robert Finn established an oratory (a public church where the Mass and other rites may be administered) for the institute at a historic church otherwise in danger of being closed. The superior for the United States is Canon Matthew Talarico.\n\nThe institute is active in the dioceses of Liverpool, Lancaster, Shrewsbury and East Anglia in Great Britain; in 2011 the Bishop of Shrewsbury invited the institute to re-open the church of Saints Peter, Paul and Philomena in New Brighton. \n\nSince St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 2006, the institute has had a presence in the Diocese of Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. In Limerick they purchased Sacred Heart Church, Since May 2010, the institute in Ireland has expanded into the diocese of Galway where weekly Mass is offered at St Mary on the Hill, Claddagh. Monthly Masses are offered by priests of the Institute in Ennis every first Sunday of the month and in Belfast every second Sunday of the month. The Institute is closely involved in the annual Catholic Voice conference held in Limerick which features amongst its regular speakers Cardinal Burke and Fr. John Hunwicke.\n\nIn addition to its oratories in the United States and missions in Africa, the institute also has apostolates in France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The institute is especially active in the domain of education, running schools in France (Montpellier, Lille and Versailles), Belgium (Brussels International Catholic School), and Africa.\n\nDuring its yearly ordinations week in Italy, the institute has had visits by Cardinals Raymond Leo Burke, Antonio Cañizares Llovera, Darío Castrillón Hoyos, Giuseppe Siri and Archbishop Camille Perl.\n\nThe Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus Christ Sovereign Priest are a women's community (founded in 2001) associated with the institute. They are also based in Gricigliano. The sisters are non-cloistered contemplatives, and their way of life is based on the Benedictine tradition. The community celebrates Mass and the Divine Office using the traditional Roman Rite. When the number of sisters has increased sufficiently, the community plans to locate convents near the institute's churches, where the sisters will perform apostolic work such as teaching. , the sisters numbered 42. The sisters have established a presence in Germany.\n\nMass and the Divine Office celebrated in the classical Roman form, form the rhythm of each day. Needlework and embroidery projects form an important part of their daily \"\"Ora et Labora\"\" (\"pray and work\").\n\nThe Society of the Sacred Heart is a lay society associated with the Institute of Christ the King. The lay members of the society pledge to live according to a modified Benedictine rule, within their vocation. Through membership in the society, lay faithful participate in the spiritual and social missions of the institute through prayer, devotions, spiritual direction, and study of the spiritual writings of St. Francis de Sales. \n\nGilles Wach is the founder and prior general. \n\nPhilippe Mora is the co-founder and rector of the international St. Philip Neri seminary in Gricigliano.\n\nRudolf Michael Schmitz is the vicar general of the institute and provincial of the German-speaking countries.\n\nThe institute has its own choir dress, adopted in 2006, which it received from Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, Archbishop of Florence.\n\nCanons, superiors, and the prior general\n\n\n\n"}

B., Fr. 154, ed. Klausen). In the geography of Herodotus (iv. 20,100--103,107) they are found occupying the districts east of the Androphagi, and north of the Royal Scythians, 20 days' journey from the \"Palus Maeotis\"; over above them were lakes and lands unknown to man. It has been conjectured that Herodotus may refer, through some hearsay statement, to the lakes Ladoga and Onega. There has been considerable discussion among geographers as to the position which should be assigned to this tribe: it is of course impossible to fix this with any accuracy; but there would seem to be reason to place them as far north as the sources of the Volga, or even further. (Schafarik, Slav. Alt. vol. i. p. 295.) Herodotus expressly says that they did not belong to the Scythian-Scolotic stock, although their customs were the same. The name, the Black-cloaks, like that of their cannibal neighbours, the \"Anthropophagi\", was applied to them by the Greeks, and was not a corrupted form of any indigenous appellation. \n\nThe second people bearing this name is mentioned by Scylax of Caryanda (p. 32) as a tribe of Pontus. Pomponius Mela (i. 19. § 4) and Pliny (vi. 5) coincide with Scylax, who speaks of two rivers flowing through their territory, the Metasoris (Μετάσωρις), probably the same as the Thessyris (Θέσσυρις, Ptol. v. 9. § § 10, 30: Kamisiliar), and the Aegipius (Αἰγίπιος: Kentichli). Dionysius Periegetes (v. 309) places this people (or perhaps confuses the prior) on the Borysthenes, and Ptolemy (v. 9. § 19) between the river Rha and the \"Hippici Montes\", in Asiatic Sarmatia; but it would be a great error to found any observation concerning these ancient northern tribes upon either the Roman writers or Ptolemy, or to confuse the picture set before us by these geographers, and the more correct delineations of Herodotus. \n\nThe third people were the Melanchlaeni of Ammianus (xxii. 8. § 31), which were the Alani.\n\n"}

The cockpit would hit the water at before inverting. The preflight student must detach the communication wire from the helmet, release the seat and shoulder harness, dive still deeper and swim away from the \"aircraft\" at a 45 degree angle to the surface for the purpose of assuming that the water around an actual situation has burning fuel on the water's surface.\n\nThe Dunker was still in use as of 1997, and a helicopter-specific version remains in service even though the original version has fallen out of service.\n\nThe device was featured in the 1982 film, \"An Officer and a Gentleman\", starring Richard Gere and Debra Winger.\n\nThe device is used as a test for astronauts in the novel \"The Calculating Stars\" by Mary Robinette Kowal.\n"}

According to the stories, he was a wandering minstrel who became a member of Robin's band of outlaws, the \"Merry Men\".\n\nHe is a relatively late addition to the legend; he first appeared in a 17th-century broadside ballad, Child Ballad 138, \"Robin Hood and Allen a Dale\", and, unlike many of the characters thus associated, managed to adhere to the legend. In this tale, Robin rescues Alan's sweetheart from an unwanted marriage to an old knight. They stop the bishop from proceeding with the ceremony, and Robin Hood, dressed in the bishop's robes, marries Alan to his bride. In other versions it is Little John or Friar Tuck that performs the ceremony.\n\nAnother variant appears in which the hero is not Alan but Will Scarlet, but Alan has taken over the role completely.\n\nHoward Pyle uses this tale in his book \"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood\", but changes several details. He gives Alan's sweetheart the name Ellen, and introduces Friar Tuck into the story; Tuck is sought out specifically as the only priest who will perform the wedding in defiance of the bishop, and therefore, this tale is combined with that of \"Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar\".\n\nIn Pierce Egan the Younger's story \"Robin Hood and Little John\", Alan is given the name Sir Allan Clare; he is an armed knight, not a minstrel, and he is the brother of the Maid Marian. His sweetheart is Lady Christabel, the daughter of the Sheriff of Nottingham, who wants to give her to an old knight friend of his. The \"Allan-a-Dale\" name is given to his estates in Sherwood Forest; he is not given a major role after he and Christabel are married by Little John (who takes the place of the Bishop of Hereford), though he helps the Merry Men from time to time.\n\nAlan plays a prominent role in some later plays, children's novels, films, and television shows.\n\n\n"}

Released in Japan in 1999 and in North America and Europe in 2000, the game is part of the \"Mega Man Legends\" (\"Rockman DASH\") series. It is also a prequel and spin-off of the first Legends game.\n\nRather than focusing on the heroic protagonists of Mega Man Legends series, the game follows series antihero Tron Bonne, sister of the criminal Bonne family of air pirates. The Japanese counterpart included PocketStation support whereas the North American and European version did not.\n\nUnlike other games in the \"Mega Man\" series, \"MTB\" bears three distinct play styles, each related to a specific mission. Players are tasked with completing (with gradual difficulty) \"moving-box\" puzzle stages (containers of various contents in Teche and Primiki Harbor), a \"Descent\"-like adventure stage, and several action stages similar to the remainder of the \"Mega Man Legends\" series (robbing a bank near Gold City and exploring the Nakkai Ruins themselves). Another gameplay aspect is a collection mission built into one of the action missions, located in Sart Farm, where you must gather pigs, cows and horses. Players can choose freely among the three stage types at any time, but each level may only be cleared once. The only exception is the Nakkai Ruins, which can be explored anytime, however the player may only collect Diana's Tear (by defeating the boss) once (afterwards the boss room will be empty).\n\nInstrumental in the game's story is the interaction between Tron and her army of forty loyal Servbots. Each Servbot is given a personality and a few other traits, and the player's investigation and interaction is rewarded with money for the loan, additional parts and weapons for the Gustaff, or other assistance. Servbots also play a role during the adventure and action stages (limited to seven, three or one, depending on the type, generally one leading the others, and called \"sniper\"), assisting Tron in her quest by ransacking houses or defeating minor threats as the situation and their individual skills warrant. A Servbot's skills may be increased by putting him through training exercises (attack and speed), going on missions (brains) or by disciplining him in the Torture Room (thus lowering the sloth level); in both cases, the effect of the action is determined by a minigame. Some Servbots learn their special skill once their skills reach a high enough level, whilst others learn it as soon as they're given a certain special item.\n\nThe family's leader, Teisel Bonne, seeks an ancient ruin (the Nakkai Ruins) to try and uncover a gigantic and highly valuable Refractor (Diana's Tear). He has a short rendezvous with Bon Bonne, but he and Bon are quickly subdued and captured by Glyde, a rival air pirate in the service of Mr. Loath. Tron finds out that the money used to build the Bonnes' flying fortress was funded by Mr. Loath, and can only watch helplessly, having chosen to act as Spotter for the mission. After discovering that Teisel defaulted on his 1,000,000 zenny loan, she realises that she has no choice but to pay off the loan, or Teisel and Bon will not be seen again. Seeing no other options, Tron suits up in a custom Gustaff mecha and, along with her army of 40 identical Servbots, begins her quest to pay the ransom through any means possible; especially by theft.\n\nDuring repeated bank robberies, Tron meets (and to an extent, befriends) officer Denise Marmalade, who repeatedly fails to stop her, even when engaging Tron in her own police-issue mecha. In the caves, the Servbots find the three Aurora Stones, help the restless spirit of a man that died trying to find the Fountain of Youth (which was, in fact, a primitive form of root beer), and help two Diggers fall in love. And in the ruins, Tron explores for valuable artifacts, including Diana's Tear (which Teisel was meant to find).\n\nAfter various adventures, Tron brings the one million zenny to Mr. Loath, who then claims that Teisel also owes interest on his loan, to the sum of \"two\" million zenny. She proceeds to acquire the requested money, and is then told that she owes interest \"on\" the interest. Realizing that Loath will never let Teisel and Bon go, she too is captured and placed in Teisel's cell.\n\nAt this point, the player takes control of their Favorite Servbot (who has the distinctive \"red head parts\"), who sets off on a rescue mission. Though the Favorite Servbot succeeds in freeing Teisel, Tron, and Bon Bonne, and then defeating Glyde, Loath is still able to activate his secret weapon: the Colossus. The Bonnes at first try to attack it with the Gesselschaft's weapons, but this has almost no effect, and the Colossus' return fire causes Tron to be very seriously injured and Teisel to get thrown overboard. Thus, the Favorite Servbot and his Servbot crew have to take on the Colossus in the Gustaff. They succeed, finally defeating Loath and Glyde once and for all. And to ensure they never cause trouble again, Tron hands them into the police, saving officer Denise's job in the process (as she gets given the credit for catching them).\n\nThe issue finally resolved, the Bonnes, reunited, set off for Kattelox Island. While in flight, the Favorite Servbot accidentally throws out a giant Refractor won from Loath with the trash, causing Tron and Teisel to freak out and force a pit stop to search for it. At this point, the events of \"Mega Man Legends\" takes place.\n\n\"The Misadventures of Tron Bonne\" was first revealed in December 1998. A Capcom representative said that although a release was not confirmed yet, the staff would to announce it in a short time due to the popularity of the first \"Mega Man Legends\" game.\n\nIn June 1999, Capcom announced that \"Tron Ni Kobun\" would come packed with a trial demo version of the then-upcoming \"Rockman DASH 2\" (\"Mega Man Legends 2\"). The demo was meant to provide better graphics and a larger scale universe. According to the official Japanese Rockman DASH website by Capcom, the Japanese demo isn't by any means a prototype, but an adventure \"completely independent\" from the final retail product of the game. The demo is known as \"Rockman DASH 2: Episode 1 ~ Roll-chan Kiki Ippatsu!\". The demo included in the North American version would much closer resemble the final content of the game, consisted of three selectable events, two being boss fights (against Tron's crabbot and a giant ape-ish Reaverbot, which can be considered as \"easy\" and \"hard\", respectively) and the last one the full exploration of the Forbidden Ruins).\n\nThe game has the same voice acting from the rest of the other \"Legends\" games for its main characters. In the North American version, Tron Bonne is voiced by Caroly Larson, while Teisel is voiced by Rob Smith (Tesshō Genda in Japan). This is the only game in the \"Legends\" series where Ikue Ōtani does not provide Bon Bonne's voice for the North American version. The Japanese version of the game features two vocal songs, \"Love Letter\" and \"Magic!\", both sung by Mayumi Iizuka, Tron Bonne's Japanese voice actress.\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"This is not a game that's neatly pigeonholed as anything, whether by game genre, or by approach, which as far as we're concerned is reason enough to like it. The bonus is that it also happens to be terrific.\"\n\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 27 out of 40.\n\nAccording to Media Create sales information, \"The Misadventures of Tron Bonne\" was the 212th best-selling video game in Japan in 1999 at 61,127 copies sold. Eidos reported light sales of the game, among other releases, for its first quarter financial results ending June 30, 2000.\n\nIn a 2007 retrospective of the \"Mega Man\" series, Jeremy Parish of \"1UP.com\" ranked \"The Misadventures of Tron Bonne\" as \"Worth it!\", with comments focused on the gameplay and the playable characters. GameSpot called it a \"bridge\" between \"Mega Man Legends\" and its sequel and that some fans would not find it appealing.\n\n"}

Even though it is advertised as a \"500-mile\" race, because TMS is a track that is in length, the actual race distance is . Denny Hamlin is the defending race winner.\n\nThe first two runnings of the race were controversial, crash-strewn affairs, with universal criticism that the track's design was one groove; Kenny Wallace argued, \"They're so busy building condos they don't have time to fix the racetrack.\"\n\nThere were ten different winners in the first ten races, the longest such streak for any NASCAR track in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. This list includes Texas Native Terry Labonte, who won in 1999, and Dale Earnhardt Jr winning his first race in 2000. Jeff Burton, the winner of the inaugural race, broke that streak by getting his second Texas win in a last lap pass in 2007. In 2011, the race became a Saturday night event, whereas before it was always a Sunday afternoon race. This was done since the night race at Phoenix was moved to February and became a day race. The 2011 race was run on April 9, 2011 and was the first scheduled night race of the season, and in Texas Motor Speedway history for the Cup Series.\n\nIn 2013, NASCAR became involved in controversy when the National Rifle Association (NRA) began to sponsor the race; although race sponsorships are negotiated with the track owner, not NASCAR itself, the sanctioning organization has final approval and did not object to the sponsorship. Both NASCAR's acceptance of this sponsorship, and its timing, has been controversial, and offensive to gun control activists. Because of the sponsorship, Senator Chris Murphy asked Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox Sports, which was scheduled to air the race, to not broadcast it. Fox broadcast the race as scheduled, not least because failure to do so would have been a breach of the network's contract with NASCAR. However, Fox only used the official sponsored name once per hour (the minimum mandated by NASCAR) and otherwise referred to it generically (in this case as the \"Texas 500\"), the network's usual practice when a race's title sponsor does not buy ads during the race broadcast; the NRA reportedly did not seek to purchase any such ads. The NRA would return as a race sponsor in 2016 for the Bristol Night Race in August at Speedway's owned Bristol Motor Speedway.\n\nIn 2014, the race returned to being a Sunday afternoon race because of the NCAA Men's basketball Final Four games being held at AT&T Stadium in nearby Arlington, so that the race occurs on a day in between tournament games. On February 6, 2014, Duck Commander, the business that is the subject of the TV show \"Duck Dynasty\", bought the naming rights for the race. The race returned to its Saturday night date in 2015.\nIn 2017, the race would once again return to Sunday afternoon and the race was renamed under a new sponsorship deal with O'Reilly Auto Parts.\n\nSince 2002, the trophy awarded to the winner has been cowboy boots, a white cowboy hat, and a pair of six-shooters to fire off in victory lane. The winner of the event, and the same goes for the Fall race, bolts their name onto a Wall of Champions that has their name engraved on a plate using a laser engraver.\n\nSamsung sponsored the race from 2002–2012, while RadioShack was previously a co-sponsor. The joint sponsorship was grandfathered in 2003 by NASCAR's grandfather clause when Nextel became a NASCAR sponsor, as they banned rival wireless sponsorships (Nextel used Motorola exclusively); the ban was lifted after the 2005 merger of Sprint and Nextel because Sprint is sold at RadioShack, and Sprint offers Samsung products.\n\n\n\n"}

Mostly it seems, though, that the channel's utter lack of resemblance with conventional television and its immediacy in regard to the surrounding urban landscape was welcomed by the majority of viewers.\nIn an attempt to attract attention and to accumulate much-sought revenues from related SMS-services, ATV soon after its launch took to showing pornography without charge during nighttime.\n"}

It is a standalone sequel to his 1984 film \"Purple Rain\". Like its predecessor, it was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the same name.\n\nThe plot continues with The Kid, living future life as an upbeat performer and co-owner of a club, Glam Slam, which was willed to him from Billy, who was the owner of First Avenue Club in the first film. Solitary and lovelorn, he spends his personal time composing songs, and writing letters to his deceased father. The other co-owner who was included in the will is Morris (Morris Day), his rival who now also owns his own club, Pandemonium, while desiring control of the other two clubs in the Seven Corners area, which are Melody Cool and the Clinton Club. Needing to pay the mayor of Seven Corners $10,000, Morris attempts to extort The Kid – by threatening to take full ownership of Glam Slam. Making matters more interesting is the arrival of Aura, an angel sent from Heaven to sway both Morris and The Kid into leading more righteous lives – while dealing with their attraction to her. As The Kid continues to show resistance, Morris begins to embarrass him by way of performances with his band, to steal The Kid's customers. Losing clientele and having his club defamed by Morris's henchmen, The Kid decides to challenge Morris to a music battle for ownership of Glam Slam.\n\n\nAccording to Terry Lewis, the film was originally a vehicle for The Time, but \"in the end the story got lost and it became a Prince picture. But that was cool. I think our rapport with Prince is better now than it's ever been, because there's a mutual respect in the air ... Plus we got to hang out for six months on somebody else's budget.\" Morris Day explained: \"A sequel to \"Purple Rain\" is what it ended up being. And the role that The Time plays is, well, crooks. In \"Purple Rain\" we were small time crooks and now we've graduated to the big time. We own and control this area called Seven Corners – which is really four corners and four clubs – and everyone answers to us. It's really about the rivalry between us and The Kid (Prince), who is the picked-on, felt-sorry-for hero. But in the end he gets the girl and he beats us with a ballad. He changes our hearts and minds and makes us into good, church-going individuals with a song [laughs].\"\n\nThe film is tied into the album of the same name, which spawned the chart-making singles, \"Round and Round\" and \"New Power Generation\", as well as \"Thieves in the Temple\". Despite the film receiving lukewarm responses from audiences, the accompanying album fared better. Although there were many tracks, the following ones were selected for the album to appear in listed order within the film, although several songs appear in shorter and rearranged lengths.\n\n\nThe film was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Prince), Worst Director (Prince), Worst Screenplay (Prince), and Worst New Star (Ingrid Chavez).\n\nDespite media hype of it being the sequel to the massively successful \"Purple Rain\", it was a commercial and critical failure and was included on several Worst-of-1990 movie lists. \"Graffiti Bridge\" currently holds a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10.\n\nHowever, the corresponding original soundtrack received widespread critical acclaim with glowing reviews from \"Rolling Stone\"s Paul Evans, Entertainment Weekly's Greg Sandow, and the Chicago Tribune's Greg Kot, the latter stating that the album was \"a sprawling, wildly diffuse statement on love, sin, sex and salvation that ranks with his best work.\" In his review, Evans wrote that Prince\n\nIn 1991, Prince was quoted as saying \"(It was) one of the purest, most spiritual, uplifting things I've ever done. It was non-violent, positive and had no blatant sex scenes. Maybe it will take people 30 years to get it. They trashed 'The Wizard of Oz' at first, too.\" \n\nThe title \"Graffiti Bridge\" comes from a now torn-down bridge located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The bridge was torn down in the early 1990s to make way for new construction, but to this day remains a local legend.\n\n\"Graffiti Bridge\" was released on DVD on February 8, 2005. The film was released on Blu-ray for the first time on October 4, 2016 separately in a purple case and as part of the Prince Movie Collection.\n\n"}

A colony of bees may live in a bee tree for many years. Most bee trees have a large inner hollow, often with an upper and lower entrance.\n\nColonies in trees have fixed comb, so inspection and management is impossible, as is most harvesting without destroying the colony. A beekeeper can perform a cut-out on a gum hive. The trunk is cut open to expose the cavity, and the comb is carefully removed and strapped into standard frames. The frames are then put to a conventional hive, such as a Langstroth hive. The bees will follow into the new hive especially if the queen and brood can be transferred.\n\nIf the tree is cut down and the trunk section containing the colony is removed, the result is a log gum or gum hive. A log gum is essentially a bee tree cut into a short section that contained a colony of honey bees. It got its name from the fact that when gum trees die they rot from the inside out, thereby creating a large cavity in which bees would commonly nest. These hives are fixed comb hives and, therefore, medicating and inspecting is almost impossible.\n"}

{"id": "2220463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220463", "title": "Missing white woman syndrome", "text": "Missing white woman syndrome\n\nMissing white woman syndrome is a term used by social scientists and media commentators to refer to extensive media coverage, especially in television, of missing person cases involving young, white, upper-middle-class women or girls. The term is used to describe the Western media's undue focus on upper-middle-class white women who disappear, with the degree of coverage they receive being compared to cases of missing women of color, women of lower social classes and missing men or boys. Although the term was coined to describe disproportionate coverage of missing person cases, it is sometimes used to describe similar disparities in news coverage of other violent crimes. Instances have been cited in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa.\n\nPBS news anchor Gwen Ifill is said to be the originator of the phrase. Charlton McIlwain defines the syndrome as white women occupying \"a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting\", and concludes that missing white woman syndrome functions as a type of racial hierarchy in the cultural imagery of the West. Eduardo Bonilla-Silva categorizes the racial component of missing white woman syndrome as a form of racial grammar, through which white supremacy is normalized by implicit or even invisible standards.\n\nMissing white woman syndrome has led to a number of right-wing tough on crime measures that were named for white women who disappeared and were subsequently found harmed. In addition to race and class, factors such as supposed attractiveness, body size and youthfulness function as unfair criteria in the determination of newsworthiness in coverage of missing women. News coverage of missing black women was more likely to focus on the victim's problems, such as abusive boyfriends or a troubled past, while coverage of white women tends to focus on their roles as mothers or daughters.\n\nA study of news coverage of missing children found that African American missing children cases were significantly underrepresented when compared to national statistics. Female missing children were significantly underrepresented in national news reporting. The coverage of death cases for African American boys was significantly greater than expected. Coverage of non-African American female kidnapping cases was greater than expected. A subsequent study found that girls from minority groups were the most under-represented in these missing-children news reports by a very large margin.\n\nZach Sommers, a sociologist at Northwestern University, noted that while there is a sizable body of research that shows that white people are more likely than people of color to appear in news coverage as victims of violent crime, there is relatively little when it comes to missing persons cases. In 2013, Sommers cross-referenced the missing persons coverage of four national and local media outlets against the FBI's missing persons database. Sommers found black people received disproportionately less coverage than whites and men received disproportionately less coverage than women; Sommers could not directly assess the number of missing white women in the FBI files due to how the data was structured but concluded that there was circumstantial—although not statistically conclusive—evidence that white women received disproportionate coverage. In the same study, professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva theorised that the subtle standard of placing a premium on white lives in the news helps to maintain and reinforce a racial hierarchy with whites at the top. For example, black women are members of both a marginalized racial group and a marginalized gender group. Crucially, though, black women have an \"intersectional experience [that] is greater than the sum of racism and sexism\". In other words, like white women, black women are subject to sexism, but the form of that sexism differs for black women because of the compounding effects of racial discrimination; with missing white woman syndrome being a pertinent manifestation of this social phenomenon. Some sociologists have argued that the tone of media coverage for black female victims differs markedly from coverage of white female victims in that the former are more likely to be blamed for purportedly putting themselves in harm's way, either knowingly or unknowingly. Victim blaming in this context reinforces the notion that black female victims are not only less innocent, but also less worthy of rescue relative to white women. Other observers note the lack of publicity given to black female victims of police brutality in news coverage, attributing the silence to a tradition of \"sexism and patriarchy\" in American society.\n\nA report that aired on CNN noted the differences between the level of media coverage given to Caucasian women like Laci Peterson and Natalee Holloway, who disappeared in 2002 and 2005 respectively, and LaToyia Figueroa, a pregnant Black Hispanic woman. Figueroa disappeared in Philadelphia the same year Holloway disappeared. Figueroa and her unborn daughter were found murdered. The San Francisco Chronicle published an article detailing the disparity between the coverage of the Peterson case and that of Evelyn Hernandez, a Hispanic woman who was nine months pregnant when she disappeared in 2002.\n\nKym Pasqualini, president of the National Center for Missing Adults, observed that media outlets tend to focus on \"damsels in distress\"—typically, affluent young white women and teenagers.\n\nIn a 2016 \"Esquire\" article about the disappearance of Tiffany Whitton, journalist Tom Junod observed that white women of lower social status such as Whitton, a 26-year-old unemployed drug addict who was on parole, do not get much media attention as \"media outlets are ruthlessly selective, and they tend to prefer women who are white, pretty, and, above all, innocent.\" Whitton's mother stated that producers of shows like \"Nancy Grace\" told her they weren't interested in her daughter's case. Dr. Cory L. Armstrong wrote in \"The Washington Post\", \"the pattern of choosing only young, white, middle-class women for the full damsel treatment says a lot about a nation that likes to believe it has consigned race and class to irrelevance.\"\n\nAccording to a study published in \"The Law and Society Association\", aboriginal women who go missing in Canada receive 27 times less news coverage than white women; they also receive \"dispassionate and less-detailed, headlines, articles, and images\".\n\nIn January 2006, the (London) Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair accused the media of ‘institutional racism’ in its reporting of murders. He contrasted the reporting of the death of the male white lawyer Tom ap Rhys Price with the murder of the male Asian builders’ merchant Balbir Matharu. He said ‘murders in minority communities do not seem to interest the mainstream media’. He said that the death of Damilola Taylor (a 10-year-old black boy) was clearly an exception to this. He said he had been surprised at how much coverage the murders of two 10-year-old white girls in Soham had received. He did not mention any\nwhite women.\n\nUniversity of Leicester Criminology Professor Yvonne Jewkes cites the murder of Milly Dowler, the murder of Sarah Payne, and the Soham murders as examples of \"eminently newsworthy stories\" about girls from \"respectable\" middle-class families and backgrounds whose parents used the news media effectively. She writes that, in contrast, the killing of Damilola Taylor, a 10-year-old boy from Nigeria, initially received little news coverage, with reports initially concentrating upon street crime levels and community policing in London, and largely ignoring the victim. Even when Damilola's father flew into the UK from Nigeria to make press statements and television appearances, the level of public outcry did not, Jewkes asserts, reach \"the near hysterical outpourings of anger and sadness that accompanied the deaths of Sarah, Milly, Holly, and Jessica\". However, according to the BBC, the killing of Damilola Taylor had shocked the UK.\n\nTwo cases of missing white girl syndrome that have been given as contrasting examples: the murder of Hannah Williams and the murder of Danielle Jones (both were white). It was suggested that Jones received more coverage than Williams because Jones was a middle-class schoolgirl, whilst Williams was from a working-class background with a stud in her nose and estranged parents. Another explanation for the difference in the coverage has been given: the eroticisation of the victim by news reports about a sexual relationship between Jones and her murderer (who was her uncle).\n\nSandile Memela, chief director for social cohesion at South Africa's Department of Arts and Culture, noted amidst the Oscar Pistorius trial that there existed substantial differences between how media outlets reported on the murders of Reeva Steenkamp and Zanele Khumalo; two South African models, respectively white and black, who had been murdered by their boyfriends under nearly identical circumstances. Memela asserted that the discrepancy between the media coverage of the Steenkamp and Khumala murders amounted to \"structural racism\" within South African society, and stated: \"As a country we seem to have chosen to ignore the agony, pain and suffering of the Khumalo family for no other reason than that they are black.\"\n\nOn September 11, 2014, the South African news network SABC3 aired an investigative report which raised concerns around the \"Missing White Woman Syndrome\"; where the death of Steenkamp was juxtaposed with the death of Zanele Khumalo.\n\nSocial commentaries pointed to media bias in the coverage of soldier Jessica Lynch versus that of her fellow soldiers, Shoshana Johnson and Lori Piestewa. All three were ambushed in the same attack during the Iraq War on March 23, 2003, with Piestewa being killed and Lynch and Johnson being injured and taken prisoner. Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a Hopi from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave more attention to the woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.\nLynch herself leveled harsh criticism at this disproportionate coverage that focused only on her, stating in a congressional testimony before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform:\n\nIn October 2013, a girl estimated to be about 4 years of age was found in the custody of a Roma couple in Greece and was presumed to have been abducted. The story about the \"blonde angel\" and the search for her biological parents received international media coverage. A Romani rights activist commented on the case to say \"imagine if the situation were reversed and the children were brown and the parents were white.\" The child was later identified as Maria Ruseva. Her biological mother was a Bulgarian Roma who gave Maria up for adoption.\n\nCritics have also cited excessive media coverage of murder trials where the defendant is female, white, young and attractive, and included them along with Missing White Woman Syndrome instances in an all-encompassing narrative nicknamed the \"woman in jeopardy\" or \"damsel in distress\" genre. In such cases, the media will focus on the accused, rather than the victim as in Missing White Woman Syndrome cases, and they will be more ambiguous about their guilt than in other criminal cases regardless of evidence. Cited examples include Amanda Knox, Jodi Arias and Casey Anthony.\n\nThe following missing person cases have been cited as instances of missing white woman syndrome; media commentators on the phenomenon regard them as garnering a disproportionate level of media coverage relative to contemporary cases involving missing girls or women of non-white ethnicities, and missing males of all ethnicities. The date of death or disappearance is given in parentheses.\n\nThe following missing person cases have been expressly compared to contemporary missing person cases labeled as examples of \"Missing White Woman Syndrome\", in order to highlight differences in coverage between them. The date of death or disappearance is given in parentheses.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also known as the first husband of Barsine, who later became mistress to Alexander the Great.\n\nIn 358 BC, Mentor, along with his brother Memnon, were hired to provide military leadership by a rebel Persian satrap, Artabazus. Despite Mentor's capable leadership, the rebellion failed, and Artabazus, Barsine and Memnon fled to Macedon, where they were welcomed by Philip II. Mentor fled to Egypt.\n\nPharaoh Nectanebo II immediately enlisted the aid of the Greek mercenary, as he expected a Persian invasion was imminent. The pharaoh sent Mentor, at the head of 4000 mercenaries, to support Sidon, which had rebelled from Persia. Although Mentor won significant victories against some of the satraps, he was unable to defeat Artaxerxes' army, and was captured in 346 BC.\n\nUpon his capture, Artaxerxes evidently recognized Mentor's skills, and pardoned him. Immediately, Mentor was sent to aid in the invasion of his former refuge, Egypt. During the Egyptian campaign Mentor led one of three divisions of the great kings Hellenic army he shared the command with Bagoas a Persian of some note whom Diodorus of Sicily describes as the man 'whom the King trusted most, a man exceptionally daring and impatient of propriety.' the pair had some success in Egypt taking Bubastus amongst other cities by one cunning device, garrisoning the cities were both native Egyptians and Greek mercenary troops Mentor offered one side or the other a favourable surrender creating stasis and infighting within the garrisons weakening the defensive troops and making it far more easy for the Persians to gain the city by subterfuge. This tactic proved critical in the battle for Egypt, Nectanebo preserving the loss of so many of his fortified towns and cities withdrew from Memphis towards the south choosing not to contest his kingship in pitched battle.\n\nAfter the defeat of Egypt, \"Artaxerxes, seeing that Mentor the general had performed great services for him in the war against the Egyptians, advanced him over and above his other friends.\" The king appointed Mentor his commander in the west in 342 BC and satrap of the Asiatic coast; he was also given a vast wealth of silver. One of his actions during his short tenure at this post was to pardon Artabazus, whom he allowed to return home, along with Barsine and Memnon. Mentor died after just four years in his post. His daughter later married Nearchus, and Barsine remarried, to Memnon. Memnon received Mentor's command after his brother's death.\n\n"}

The \"Governor Ames\" was owned and operated by the Atlantic Shipping Company based in Somerset, Massachusetts.\n\nAlthough the \"Governor Ames\" was the first five-masted schooner, she was preceded by the five-masted Great Lakes barkentine \"David Dows\", which was confusingly called a schooner despite having a square-rigged foremast. The \"David Dows\" was longer than the \"Governor Ames\" but otherwise smaller.\n\nThe schooner's first voyage, in ballast to Baltimore, Maryland, resulted in disaster on December 11, 1888, when the foremast snapped in high winds, taking the other masts with it and dismasting the \"Governor Ames\" completely.

She was the editor of the school magazine and she played and refereed basketball. She graduated in 1897 as the valedictorian for her class.\n\nAdelaide matriculated in Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1897. She had \"a very active four years\" in Vassar. For three years she was class poet. She was the editor-in-chief of the \"Vassarion\" and managed the basketball team. She was a member of the debating club and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She played the role of Lucy the maid in the play \"The Rivals\". Crapsey roomed with Jean Webster who continued to be \"her best friend and literary comrade\" for the rest of her life.\n\nTwo of Adelaide's sisters died while she was in college. Ruth died in 1898 of undulant fever at the age of eleven. Emily, with whom Adelaide was closest, died in 1901 of appendicitis at the age of twenty-four.\n\nAdelaide planned a career in teaching after graduating from Vassar in 1901. However, before beginning work, she took a year off both \"to regain her strength\" and \"to recover from the shock\" of Emily's death.\"\n\nAfter her year off, Adelaide returned to Kemper Hall to teach history and literature in 1903-1904. While there, she suffered chronic fatigue, which was a symptom of her not-yet-diagnosed tuberculosis. This caused Adelaide to leave her teaching in 1904, to study at the School of Classical Studies of the American Academy in Rome. She supported herself by working occasionally as a lecturer. In Rome, she had a great \"rebirth of energy and creativeness\" in the warm and temperate Italian climate. While there, she met a man \"who reminded her of her reason for living,\" which she had been seeking. However, the seriousness of her father's situation faced with interviews by the Committee of Investigation of the Diocese of Western New York (his diocese) and possible charges of heresy brought Adelaide back home from Rome in 1905 to support her parents.\n\nOne afternoon, when Adelaide and her mother were in the rectory and her father was out, members of the Committee of Investigation came to ask her father some questions. Her mother was \"too nervous and worn out from the months in the public eye,\" so Adelaide offered to serve the men tea. She \"spiked the tea with rum,\" which probably contributed to their good mood when they left. Adelaide's courage in the face of the enemy may have inspired her poem about the biblical Judith:\n\nIn 1906, the Diocese presented charges of heresy against Adelaide's father and an Ecclesiastical Court was established and trial was set to be held in Batavia, New York. On April 18, 1906, she went with her father and his chief counsel to Batavia. At the end of the trial, her father was found guilty of heresy.\n\nAfter the trial, Adelaide remained with her family to give them her \"support, comfort, and good humor.\" However, her \"literary and academic future\" had been suspended for eighteen months. She needed a job near enough to Rochester to be \"relatively accessible to her family.\" She found such a job, teaching history and literature at Miss Low's School in Stamford, Connecticut. Stamford was also only a short train ride from New York City where her father's Court of Appeal was held. The appeal was denied on November 20, 1906.\n\nAdelaide taught at Miss Low's for the academic years 1906-1907 and 1907-1908. With her father's appeal having been denied, he was no longer a minister in the Episcopal Church. He was given until the end of December 1906 to vacate the St. Andrew's rectory. Therefore, when Adelaide went home for Christmas in 1906, the family was moving out of the house in which had been her home for twenty-seven years and into a rented house. When Adelaide went back to Stamford, other sad events followed. Her grandmother Harriet Gunn Trowbridge, whom she had visited as a child, died. In May 1907, her eldest brother Philip died of chronic malaria, which he had contracted during the invasion of Cuba during the Spanish–American War.\n\nAdelaide was not happy teaching at Miss Low's school. The \"atmosphere was oppressive\" to her; her horizons had expanded. Nevertheless, her teaching was described as \"thrilling.\" Her students \"seemed to gravitate\" to her classes.\n\nIn 1907, Adelaide's father was a delegate to the International Peace Conference at the Hague, and she accompanied him. During the Conference, Adelaide, who was fluent in French, was in demand as a translator. The Conference was conducted in French and the newspapers were printed in French, a language which few Americans knew. The Crapseys left the Conference early \"disillusioned and disappointed.\" After the Conference, Adelaide and her father took a walking tour of Wales. Dr. Crapsey was a tireless walker, but Adelaide suffered fatigue. The cause of her fatigue was not diagnosed until 1911 when she was diagnosed with Tuberculous meningitis.\n\nAfter they returned from Europe at the end of the summer of 1907, Adelaide and her father joined the family in their \"summer cottage.\" This gave her a month before she returned to her teaching job at Miss Low's School in Stamford. Adelaide used this time to recuperate and to ponder her future possibilities. As the school year progressed, she became physically weaker. She lacked the energy for activities other than those required of her. Adelaide's weakness probably derived from tuberculosis, although it had not yet been diagnosed. She was so weak that, after a week's teaching, she often spent her weekends in bed to recuperate.\n\nIn the summer of 1908, while Adelaide was living with her family in Rochester, she \"took helplessly to bed.\" Because of her poor health, she decided that she must quit her job at Miss Low's School. This left the question of \"what would she do?\" hanging over her. She was now almost thirty. She was interested in further research on her theory of metrics, but she was not interested in learning the theories of others.\n\nTo continue her research, in December 1908 Adelaide she returned to Europe. She lived in Rome, Great Britain, and France. She spent February and March 1908 in the Anglo-American hospital in Rome. Her research was included in a book \"A Study in English Metrics\" published in 1918.\n\nIn 1911, a combination of health problems and financial issues forced Adelaide to seek employment back in the United States. Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts offered her a job teaching Poetics. She accepted it. Later that year, she was diagnosed with tuberculin meningitis. It was also in 1911 that she wrote her first cinquains.\n\nIn July 1913, Adelaide collapsed and was admitted sent to a private nursing home in Saranac Lake, New York. In the nursing home, because of her \"physical prostration,\" she was allowed to write only one letter a day. Nevertheless, she managed to write letters and poetry about her condition and her treatment. They contained \"flippant humor,\" possibly as a way of covering the reality that she was at the mercy of a disease for which there was no cure. For example, she wrote a poem she called \"Lines Addressed To My Left Lung Inconveniently Enamoured of Plant Life.\"\n\nIn August 1914, sicker than ever, Adelaide left the nursing home and returned to her parents' home in Rochester. She died there on October 8, 1914 at the age of thirty-six. As she was dying, she \"passed on the torch to her nurse,\" saying, \"Let the story I was not able to tell be told.\" She is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester.\n\nAdelaide's biographer Karen Alkalay-Gut described her life as \"constantly hampered by illness, grief, and impecunity.\" The discrepancy between what she had anticipated doing and what she \"actually accomplished was embarrassing to her.\" The five-line cinquain poetic form she created reflected her life. The first four lines build up \"expectancy\" only to be followed by a one stress line as an \"abbreviated conclusion.\"\n\nCrapsey's hope for her immortality was in her writings. The \"envoi\" of her \"Verse\", entitled \"The Immortal Residue,\" reads:\n\nClaude Bragdon was a friend of the Crapsey family in Rochester. Besides being a noted architect, he had a press. Using his Manus Press, he published a book of Crapsey's poems entitled \"Verse\" (Manas Press, 1915). The book had a Foreword by Bragdon and a Preface by Jean Webster who had been Crapsey's roommate at Vassar and her lifelong friend. In her Introduction to \"Verse\", Webster wrote that Adelaide was \"by nature as vivid and joyous and alive a spirit as ever loved the beauty of life, like Keats and Stevenson, worked doggedly for many years against the numbing weight of a creeping pitiless disease.\"\n\nRevised editions of \"Verse\" were published in 1922 and 1934 and contain earlier unpublished work. Also published posthumously in 1918 was the unfinished \"A Study in English Metrics\", a work she began during her three-year stay in Europe, and described in the prefatory note thereto as \"a laborious analysis dictated by an acute sense of beauty of verse by an aesthetic experience of unusual intensity.\"\n\nCrapsey's ashes were buried in the Crapsey family plot in Mount Hope Cemetery. John Rothwell Slater (1872-1965), chairman of the University of Rochester Department of English, wrote these \"Lines for Adelaide Crapsey's Grave in Mount Hope\":\n\nPoet Carl Sandburg was partly responsible for the continued interest in the cinquain and in keeping Crapsey from obscurity through his poem \"Adelaide Crapsey.\"\nAdelaide Crapsey's nephew, Arthur H. Crapsey, became an influential industrial designer in the years following World War II, and is known for a series of iconic camera designs for Eastman Kodak.\n\nAdelaide Crapsey's papers are at the University of Rochester Library archives.\n\nIn the years before her death, she wrote much of the verse on which her reputation rests. Her interest in rhythm and meter led her to create a unique variation on the cinquain (or quintain), a 5-line form of 22 syllables influenced by the Japanese haiku and tanka. Her five-line cinquain (now styled as an American cinquain) has a generally iambic meter defined as \"one-stress, two-stress, three-stress, four-stress and suddenly back to one-stress\" and normally consists of 2 syllables in the first and last lines and 4, 6 and 8 syllables in the middle three lines, as shown in the poem Niagara. Marianne Moore said of her poetic style, \"Crapsey's apartness and delicately differentiated footfalls, her pallor and color were impressive.\"\n\n\nAmerican Poetry, The Twentieth Century, Volume One, The Library of America, 2000.\n\n\n\n"}

Tapavica achieving his best result in tennis by winning the singles bronze medal at the 1896 Summer Olympics, making him the first ethnic Serb, Slav and Hungarian citizen to win an Olympic medal. After his sporting career Tapavica became a well-known architect.\n\nTapavica, an ethnic Serb, was born in Nádalja, Kingdom of Hungary (now Nadalj, Serbia) in 1872. He began to practise sports in Újvidék (Novi Sad), continuing his training in Budapest, where he studied architecture and civil engineering at the Technical College. His performances excelled and he was selected in the Hungarian team for the first Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, where he competed in tennis, weightlifting and wrestling.\n\nAt the 1896 Summer Olympics, Tapavica, being the lone tennis player in Hungary's Olympic Team, won the bronze medal in the singles tennis tournament.\n\nIn the first round, he defeated D. Frangopoulos of Greece. The second round gave him a bye, subsequently Dionysios Kasdaglis of Egypt beat Tapavica in the semifinal, and with no playoff for third place he shared bronze medal honors with Greek Konstantinos Paspatis. Tapavica was the first ethnic Serb to win an Olympic medal, as well as the first – and to date the only – Hungarian to win a medal in tennis at the Olympic Games. He did not compete in the doubles tournament.\n\nIn weightlifting, Tapavica overextended himself, which caused him a shoulder injury and eventually finished last of the six competitors in the two-handed weightlifting, now known as the clean and jerk. Two days later, still unhealed, Tapavica was defeated in the first round of the wrestling competition by Stephanos Christopoulos. The two were nearly evenly matched, but Tapavica tired first and conceded.\n\nAfter the Olympic Games, Tapavica never again participated in competitive events, however he continued to do recreational sports, such as athletics, gymnastics and rowing. For many years he was a member of the Újvidék-based rowing club \"Danubius\".\n\nAfter his graduation, Tapavica remained in Budapest for a shorter period before returning to Újvidék. In 1908, for the invitation of Nicholas I of Montenegro, Tapavica went to Montenegro, where he designed several buildings. Among his notable works from this period are the German Embassy and National Bank in Cetinje, and the building of Boka Hotel in Herceg Novi, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1979. The building of the Matica srpska in Novi Sad, erected by the plans of Tapavica, was finished in 1912.\n\nUpon the outbreak of World War I, Tapavica first emigrated to Austria-Hungary, and later through Rome and Lausanne he ended up in Morocco. While in Morocco, he joined the French Foreign Legion and became friends with Spain's future dictator Francisco Franco.\n\nAfter the war he returned to Novi Sad, where he ran his own architectural design company and actively participated in discussions about the urban planning of the city. Following World War II, in 1948, he moved to Poreč, where he significantly contributed to the rebuilding of the war-torn city. He died in 1949 in Pula.\n\nHis life is the subject of a 2016 documentary \"Tapavica\" directed by Milan Todorović. A bust is bestowed in his honor in Novi Sad.\n\n"}

Created by artist Louis Salverius and writer Raoul Cauvin, the series was taken up by artist Willy Lambillotte after Salverius' death. It follows two United States cavalrymen through a series of battles and adventures. The first album of the series was published in 1970. The series' name, \"Les Tuniques Bleues\", literally \"the bluecoats\", refers to the Northern (union) army during the American Civil War. Cinebook has started to print the comics in English as \"The Bluecoats\" releasing \"Robertsonville Prison\" in 2008. It is one of the best-selling series in French-language comics.\n\nCauvin has written the stories for all the volumes thus far. The first book, \"Un chariot dans l'Ouest\" (French for \"A Wagon in the West\"), was published in 1972. The 62nd book in the series, \"Sallie\", was published in 2018.\n\nSix of the first ten volumes were illustrated by Louis Salverius, with Lambil taking over after Salverius' death.\n\nThe stories appear first in \"Spirou\" in 1968, before being published as an album. The French editions are published by Dupuis. New albums are among the top ten best selling comics in French each year, with 184,800 copies for the 50th album alone in 2006. \"Les Tuniques Bleues\" spawned a 1989 computer game called \"North and South\".\n\nThe original setting was the frontier of the Old West, where the main characters were American cavalrymen. Those stories, rarely longer than a single page, were comedic adventures about popular Western stereotypes and the absurdity of military life. One recurring feature was the blunder that lead to the Cavalry fort being besieged by outraged Native Americans, or in one case, the cavalry having to besiege their own fort after the Indians have tricked them into leaving it and taken over. As the series progressed, the stories became longer and more involved, retaining their humorous highlights. The drawing style also changed, after the death of the original artist Salverius, from overtly cartoonish to semi-realistic.\n\nIn the second album, \"Du Nord au Sud\", the main characters, Blutch and Chesterfield, travel east to join Ulysses S. Grant's army and fight in the Civil War. The 18th album, \"Blue Retro\", describes how the characters were first drafted into the military when the war had already begun and makes no mention of the time they spent on the frontier, contradicting the events in album 2 and others. This retconned origin and continuity hiccups are not detrimental to the enjoyment and understanding of the series since each album is a stand-alone adventure or collection of short stories. Adventures at the frontier fort still occasionally take place.\n\nThe two main protagonists are colorful and clashing opposites. Corporal Blutch is a reluctant soldier, highly critical of authority, whose only wish is to get out of the army and return to civilian life, often threatening to desert and coming up with ways to avoid going into yet another senseless battle. Blutch does have a heroic side and will not hesitate to fight against the Confederate troops even to the risk of his own life. Sergeant Cornelius Chesterfield is by contrast a devoted and obedient career soldier, always determined that he and Blutch should be in the thick of the action. He is proud of his scars and dreams of military glory. Though strong and brave to the point of recklessness, he is clumsy and narrow-minded, unable to clearly perceive the madness of the war around him. Though their relationship is often antagonistic, they are comrades for life and have saved each other's lives many times in spite of repeated threats made by both of doing the other in.\n\nOther recurring characters include the somewhat insane, charge-obsessed Captain Stark and the bumbling general staff, headed by the anger-prone General Alexander. Historic figures are also occasionally present in the narrative: alongside General Grant, they include President Abraham Lincoln, Confederate commander Robert E. Lee, and war photographer Mathew Brady. As happens in fiction, especially in \"bandes dessinées\", Blutch and Chesterfield often get sent on special missions which take them all over the map, from Mexico to Canada, and mix them up in projects from railroad construction to spying on the Confederacy's secret submarine project (based on the actual CSS \"David\"). Many albums are built around historical events or characters such as Chinese immigrant labor, the treatment of African American soldiers, Charleston's submarines, and General Lee's horse Traveller. Chesterfield even goes undercover to confront guerrilla leader William Quantrill and his henchmen Jesse and Frank James.

Yet the series is first and foremost entertainment and historic details are altered to suit the story. The serious drama of the plots is balanced by frequent humorous incidents and Blutch's constant sarcastic wisecracks. Although this is not strictly speaking an adult-oriented \"bande dessinée\", the authors are not afraid of showing the reality of war in a harsh, but tactful manner, such as dead bodies in the aftermath of a battle. Military authority, especially the uncaring and/or incompetent leader is often the subject of parody and derision.\n\nSeveral albums highlight historical facts of the American Civil War, other adventures are set in a place or anonymous battle. Some accounts tell of an encounter with a Native American tribe without any relation to the American Civil War. However, the chronology of the albums does not follow that of the war, but several albums are in flashback, tracing the past of the two protagonists, possibly narrated by one of them (\"Bull Run\") or another character (\"Vertes Années\").\nCinebook Ltd has started publishing English translations from 2008, as \"The Bluecoats\".

{"id": "2220550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220550", "title": "Dick Williams", "text": "Dick Williams\n\nRichard Hirschfeld Williams (May 7, 1929 – July 7, 2011) was an American left fielder, third baseman, manager, coach and front office consultant in Major League Baseball. Known especially as a hard-driving, sharp-tongued manager from 1967 to 1969 and from 1971 to 1988, he led teams to three American League pennants, one National League pennant, and two World Series triumphs. He is one of eight managers to win pennants in both major leagues, and joined Bill McKechnie in becoming only the second manager to lead three franchises to the Series. He and Lou Piniella are the only managers in history to lead four teams to seasons of 90 or more wins. Williams was inducted into the Nationall Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008 following his election by the Veterans Committee.\n\nWilliams was born on May 7, 1929, in St. Louis, Missouri, and lived there until age 13, when his family moved to Pasadena, California. After attending Pasadena City College, he signed his first professional contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, and played his first major league game with Brooklyn in 1951. A right-handed batter and thrower, Williams was listed as tall and . Initially an outfielder, he separated a shoulder attempting to make a diving catch on August 25, 1952; he missed the rest of the season and permanently weakened his throwing arm. As a result, he learned to play several positions (he was frequently a first baseman and third baseman) and became a notorious \"bench jockey\" in order to keep his major league job. He appeared in 1,023 games over 13 seasons with the Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Athletics and Boston Red Sox. Williams posted a career batting average of .260; his 768 hits included 70 home runs, 157 doubles and 12 triples. In the field, he appeared in 456 games in the outfield, 257 at third base, and 188 at first.\n\nHe was a favorite of Paul Richards, who acquired Williams four different times between 1956 and 1962 when Richards was a manager or general manager with Baltimore and the Houston Colt .45s. Williams never played for Houston; he was acquired in an off-season \"paper transaction\" on October 12, 1962, then traded to the Red Sox for another outfielder, Carroll Hardy, on December 10.\n\nHis two-year playing career in Boston was uneventful, except for one occasion. On June 27, 1963, Williams was victimized by one of the greatest catches in Fenway Park history. His long drive to the opposite field was snagged by Cleveland right fielder Al Luplow, who made a leaping catch at the wall and tumbled into the bullpen with the ball in his grasp.\n\nOn October 14, 1964, after a season during which Williams hit a career-low .159, the Red Sox handed him his unconditional release. At 35, Williams was at a career crossroads: Richards gave him a spring training invitation but no guarantee that he would make the 1965 Astros' playing roster; the Red Sox offered Williams a job as playing coach with their Triple-A farm team, the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Looking to begin a post-playing career in baseball, Williams accepted the Seattle assignment. Within days, a shuffle in 1965 affiliations forced Boston to move its top minor league team to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. This caused the Red Sox' Triple-A manager, Seattle native Edo Vanni, to resign in order to remain in the Pacific Northwest. With a sudden opening for the Toronto job, Williams was promoted to manager of the 1965 Leafs. As a novice pilot, Williams adopted a hard-nosed, disciplinarian style and won two consecutive Governors' Cup championships with teams laden with young Red Sox prospects. He then signed a one-year contract to manage the 1967 Red Sox.\n\nBoston had suffered through eight straight seasons of losing baseball, and attendance had fallen to such an extent that owner Tom Yawkey was threatening to move the team. The Red Sox had talented young players, but the team was known as a lazy \"country club.\" As Carl Yastrzemski commented, \"if you don't keep your nose to the grindstone you won't (win)...we kept our noses so far away from the grindstone we couldn't even see it.\"\n\nWilliams decided to risk everything and impose discipline on his players. He vowed that \"we will win more ballgames than we lose\" — a bold statement for a club that had finished only a half-game from last place in 1966. The only team with a worse record than the Red Sox was their arch-rival, the New York Yankees, who were headed in a downward spiral only two years after losing the 1964 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. In spring training, Williams drilled players in fundamentals for hours. He issued fines for curfew violations, and insisted his players put the success of the team before their own. In Yastrzemski's words, \"Dick Williams didn't take anything when he took over the club last spring...to the best of my knowledge—and I would know if it had happened—no one challenged Williams all season.\"\n\nThe Red Sox began 1967 playing better baseball and employing the aggressive style of play that Williams had learned with the Dodgers. Williams benched players for lack of effort and poor performance, and battled tooth and nail with umpires. Through the All-Star break, Boston fulfilled Williams' promise and played better than .500 ball, hanging close to the American League's four contending teams — the Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox and California Angels. Outfielder Carl Yastrzemski, in his seventh season with the Red Sox, transformed his hitting style to become a pull-hitter, eventually winning the 1967 AL Triple Crown, leading the league in batting average, home runs (tying Harmon Killebrew of the Twins), and RBI.\nIn late July, the Red Sox rattled off a 10-game winning streak on the road and came home to a riotous welcome from 10,000 fans at Boston's Logan Airport. The Red Sox inserted themselves into a five-team pennant race, and stayed in the hunt despite the loss of star outfielder Tony Conigliaro to a beanball on August 18. On the closing weekend of the season, led by Yastrzemski and 22-game-winning pitcher Jim Lonborg, Boston defeated the Twins in two head-to-head games, while Detroit split its series with the Angels. The \"Impossible Dream\" Red Sox had won their first AL pennant since 1946, then they extended the highly talented and heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals to seven games in the 1967 World Series, losing to the great Bob Gibson three times.\n\nDespite the Series loss, the Red Sox were the toasts of New England; Williams was named Major League Manager of the Year by \"The Sporting News\" and signed to a new three-year contract. But he would not serve it out. In 1968, the team fell to fourth place when Conigliaro could not return from his head injury, and Williams' two top pitchers — Lonborg and José Santiago — suffered sore arms. He began to clash with Yastrzemski, and with owner Yawkey. With his club a distant third in the AL East, Williams was fired on September 23, 1969 and replaced by Eddie Popowski for the last nine games of the season.\n\nAfter spending 1970 as the third base coach of the Montreal Expos, working under Gene Mauch, Williams returned to the managerial ranks the next year as boss of the Oakland Athletics, owned by Charlie Finley. The iconoclastic Finley had signed some of the finest talent in baseball – including Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, Bert Campaneris, Rollie Fingers and Joe Rudi – but his players hated him for his penny-pinching and constant meddling in the team's affairs. During his first decade as the Athletics' owner, 1961–1970, Finley had changed managers a total of ten times.\n\nInheriting a second-place team from predecessor John McNamara, Williams promptly directed the A's to 101 victories and their first AL West title in 1971 behind another brilliant young player, pitcher Vida Blue. Despite being humbled in the ALCS by the defending World Champion Orioles, Finley brought Williams back for 1972, when the \"Oakland Dynasty\" began. Off the field, the A's players brawled with each other and defied baseball's tonsorial code. Because long hair, mustaches and beards were now the rage in the \"civilian\" world, Finley decided on a mid-season promotion encouraging his men to wear their hair long and grow facial hair. Fingers adopted his trademark handlebar mustache (which he still has to this day); Williams himself grew a mustache.\n\nOf course, talent, not hairstyle, truly defined the Oakland Dynasty of the early 1970s. The 1972 A's won their division by 5½ games over the White Sox and led the league in home runs, shutouts and saves. They defeated the Tigers in a bitterly fought ALCS, and found themselves facing the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. With the A's leading power hitter, Jackson, out with an injury, Cincinnati's Big Red Machine was favored to win, but the home run heroics of Oakland catcher Gene Tenace and the managerial maneuvering of Williams resulted in a seven-game World Series victory for the A's, their first championship since 1930, when they played in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1973, with Williams back for an unprecedented (for the Finley era) third straight campaign, the A's again coasted to a division title, then defeated Baltimore in the ALCS and the NL champion New York Mets in the World Series – each hard-fought series going the limit. With their World Series win, Oakland became baseball's first repeat champion since the 1961–62 New York Yankees. But Williams had a surprise for Finley. Tired of his owner's meddling, and upset by Finley's public humiliation of second baseman Mike Andrews for his fielding miscues during the World Series, Williams resigned. George Steinbrenner, then finishing his first season as owner of the Yankees, immediately signed Williams as his manager. However, Finley protested that Williams owed Oakland the final year of his contract and could not manage anywhere else, and so Steinbrenner hired Bill Virdon instead. Williams was the first manager in A's franchise history to leave the team with a winning record after running it for two full seasons.\n\nSeemingly at the peak of his career, Williams began the 1974 season out of work. But when the Angels struggled under manager Bobby Winkles, team owner Gene Autry received Finley's permission to negotiate with Williams, and in mid-season Williams was back in a big-league dugout. The change in management, though, did not alter the fortunes of the Angels, as they finished in last place, 22 games behind the A's, who would win their third straight World Championship under Williams' replacement, Alvin Dark.\n\nOverall, Williams' Anaheim tenure turned out to be a miserable one. He did not have nearly as much talent as he'd had to work with in Boston and Oakland, and the Angels did not respond to Williams' somewhat authoritarian managing style. They finished last in the AL West again in 1975. During the 1975 season, Boston Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee stated that the Angels' hitters were \"so weak, they could hold batting practice in the Boston Sheraton hotel lobby and not hit the chandelier\". Williams responded by having his team actually do so before the game with the Red Sox until hotel security put a stop to it.. The Angels were 18 games below .500 (and in the midst of a player revolt) in 1976 when Williams was fired July 22.\n\nIn 1977, he returned to Montreal as manager of the Expos, who had just come off 107 losses and a last-place finish in the NL East. Team president John McHale had been impressed with Williams' efforts in Boston and Oakland, and thought he was what the Expos needed to finally become a winner.\n\nAfter cajoling the Expos into improved, but below .500, performances in his first two seasons, Williams turned the 1979–80 Expos into pennant contenders. The team won over 90 games both years—the first winning seasons in franchise history. The 1979 unit won 95 games, the most that the franchise would win in Montreal. However, they finished second each time to the eventual World Champion (the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980). Williams was never afraid to give young players a chance to play, and his Expos teams were flush with young talent, including All-Stars such as outfielder Andre Dawson and catcher Gary Carter. With a solid core of young players and a fruitful farm system, the Expos seemed a lock to contend for a long time to come.\n\nBut Williams' hard edge alienated his players—especially his pitchers—and ultimately wore out his welcome. He labeled pitcher Steve Rogers a fraud with \"king of the mountain syndrome\" – meaning that Rogers had been a good pitcher on a bad team for so long that he was unable to \"step up\" when the team became good. Williams also lost confidence in closer Jeff Reardon, whom the Montreal front office had acquired in a much publicized trade with the Mets. When the 1981 Expos performed below expectations, Williams was fired during the pennant drive on September 7. With the arrival of his easy-going successor Jim Fanning, who restored Reardon to the closer's role, the inspired Expos made the playoffs for the only time in their 36-year history in Montreal. However, they fell in heartbreaking fashion to Rick Monday and the eventual World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers in a five-game NLCS.\n\nWilliams was not unemployed for long, however. In 1982, he took over the San Diego Padres. By 1984, he had guided the Padres to their first NL West Division championship. In the NLCS, the NL East champion Chicago Cubs – making their first postseason appearance since 1945 – won Games 1 and 2, but Williams' Padres took the next three games in a miraculous comeback to win the pennant. In the World Series, however, San Diego was no match for Sparky Anderson's Detroit Tigers, a team that had won 104 games during the regular season. Although the Tigers won the Series in five games, both Williams and Anderson joined Dark, Joe McCarthy, and Yogi Berra as managers who had won pennants in both major leagues (Tony La Russa joined this group in 2004, Jim Leyland followed suit in 2006, and Joe Maddon in 2016).\n\nThe Padres fell to third in 1985, and Williams was let go as manager just before 1986 spring training. His record with the Padres was 337–311 over four seasons. As of 2011, he was the only manager in the team's history without a losing season. His difficulties with the Padres stemmed from a power struggle with team president Ballard Smith and general manager Jack McKeon. Williams was a hire of team owner (and McDonald's restaurant magnate) Ray Kroc, whose health was failing. McKeon and Smith (who also happened to be Kroc's son-in-law) were posturing to buy the team and viewed Williams as a threat to their plans. With his San Diego tenure at an end, it appeared that Williams' managerial career was finished.\n\nWhen another perennial loser, the Seattle Mariners, lost 19 of their first 28 games in 1986 under Chuck Cottier, Williams came back to the American League West on May 6 for the first time in almost a decade. The Mariners showed some life that season and almost reached .500 the following season. However, Williams' autocratic managing style no longer resonated with the new generation of ballplayers. Williams was fired on June 8, 1988 with Seattle 23–33 and in sixth place. It would be his last major-league managing job. Williams' career won-loss totals were 1,571 wins and 1,451 losses over 21 seasons.\n\nIn 1989, Williams was named manager of the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, a league featuring mostly former major league players 35 years of age and older. The Tropics went 52–20 in the regular season and ran away with the Southern Division title. Despite their regular season dominance, the Tropics lost 12–4 to the St. Petersburg Pelicans in the league's championship game. The Tropics folded at the end of the season, and the rest of the league folded a year later.\n\nHe remained in the game, however, as a special consultant to George Steinbrenner and the New York Yankees. In 1990, Williams published his autobiography, \"No More Mister Nice Guy\". His acrimonious departure in 1969 distanced Williams from the Red Sox for the remainder of the Yawkey ownership period (through 2001), but after the change in ownership and management that followed, he was selected to the team's Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nWilliams' number was retired by the Fort Worth Cats. The Cats were a popular minor league team in Fort Worth and Williams played there during 1948, 1949 and 1950, while he was working his way through the Dodgers' system. Moreover, Williams—in his Hall off Fame speech—cited Bobby Bragan, his Fort Worth manager, as a significant influence on his own career. After the Texas League Cats finally disbanded in 1964, they returned as an independent league team in 2001. These \"New\" Cats retired Williams' number.\n\nWilliams was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in December 2007, and was inducted on July 27, 2008. He was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nHis son, Rick Williams, a former minor league pitcher and Major League pitching coach, is currently a professional scout for the Atlanta Braves. Before Dick Williams became a Major League manager in 1967, he successfully appeared on the television quiz shows The Match Game and the original Hollywood Squares. According to Peter Marshall's \"Backstage with the Original Hollywood Squares\", Williams won $50,000 as a contestant on the latter show. Marshall's son, Pete LaCock, played nine seasons (1972–1980) in the Major Leagues – but never for Williams.\n\nDick Williams died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at a hospital near his home in Henderson, Nevada on July 7, 2011.\n\nIn January 2000, Williams pleaded no contest to indecent exposure charges in Florida. This occurred just weeks before the Baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee's vote in that year's inductees.\n\n\"What happened to me down in Fort Myers when I was arrested evidently hurt me quite a bit\", Williams told the \"New York Times\" in a telephone interview. \"What came out on that in the papers was not true. I was not masturbating on the balcony. I'm going to issue a statement about it so the explanation goes across the country.\"\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "2220551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220551", "title": "Adah Isaacs Menken", "text": "Adah Isaacs Menken\n\nAdah Isaacs Menken (June 15, 1835August 10, 1868) was an American actress, painter and poet, and was the highest earning actress of her time. She was best known for her performance in the hippodrama \"Mazeppa\", with a climax that featured her apparently nude and riding a horse on stage. After great success for a few years with the play in New York and San Francisco, she appeared in a production in London and Paris, from 1864 to 1866. After a brief trip back to the United States, she returned to Europe. However, she became ill within two years and died in Paris at the age of 33.\n\nMenken told many versions of her origins, including her name, place of birth, ancestry, and religion, and historians have differed in their accounts. Most have said she was born a Louisiana Creole Catholic, with European and African ancestry. A celebrity who created sensational performances in the United States and Europe, she married several times and was also known for her affairs. She had two sons, both of whom died in infancy.\n\nThough she was better known as an actress, Menken sought to be known as a writer. She published about 20 essays, 100 poems, and a book of her collected poems, from 1855 to 1868 (the book was published posthumously). Early work was devoted to family and after her marriage, her poetry and essays featured Jewish themes. However, beginning with work published after moving to New York, with which she changed her style, Menken expressed a wide range of emotions and ideas about women's place in the world. Her collection \"Infelicia\" went through several editions and was in print until 1902.\n\nAccounts of Menken's early life and origins vary considerably. In her autobiographical \"Some Notes of Her Life in Her Own Hand,\" published in the \"New York Times\" in 1868, Menken said she was born Marie Rachel Adelaide de Vere Spenser in Bordeaux, France and lived in Cuba as a child before her family settled in New Orleans. Elsewhere, in 1865, she wrote that her birth name was Dolores Adios Los Fiertes, and that she was the daughter of a French woman from New Orleans and a Spanish-Jewish man. About 1940, the consensus of scholars was that her parents were Auguste Théodore, a free Black man, and Marie, a mixed-race Creole, and Adah was raised as a Catholic. Ed James, a journalist friend, wrote after her death: \"Her real name was Adelaide McCord, and she was born at Milneburg, near New Orleans, on June 15, 1835.\" She may have recounted this version as well. She had a sister and a brother.\n\nBased on Menken's assertions of being a native of New Orleans, Wolf Mankowitz and others have studied Board of Health records for the city. They have concluded that Ada was born in the city as the legitimate daughter of Auguste Théodore, a free man of color (mixed race) and his wife Magdaleine Jean Louis Janneaux, likely also a Louisiana Creole. Ada would have been raised as Catholic. However, in 1990, John Cofran, using census records, said that she was born as Ada C. McCord, in Memphis, Tennessee, in late 1830. He said she was the daughter of an Irish merchant, Richard McCord, and his wife Catherine. According to Cofran, her father died when she was young and her mother remarried. The family then moved from Memphis to New Orleans.\n\nAda was said to have been a bright student; she became fluent in French (which Creoles used and was still a prominent language in New Orleans) and Spanish. She was described as having a gift for languages. As a child, Adah performed as a dancer in the ballet of the French Opera House in New Orleans. In her later childhood, she performed as a dancer in Havana, Cuba, where she was crowned \"Queen of the Plaza.\"\n\nAfter Cuba, Menken left dance for acting, and began working as an actress in Texas first. According to Gregory Eiselein, she gave Shakespeare readings, and wrote poems and sketches for \"The Liberty Gazette.\" She was married for the first time in Galveston County, in February 1855, to G. W. Kneass, a musician. The marriage had ended by sometime in 1856, when she met and in 1856 married the man more generally considered her first husband, Alexander Isaac Menken, a musician who was from a prominent Reform Jewish family in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nHe began to act as her manager, and Ada Menken performed as an actress in the Midwest and Upper South, also giving literary readings. She received decent reviews, which noted her \"reckless energy,\" and performed with men who became notable actors: Edwin Booth in Louisville, Kentucky and James E. Murdoch in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nIn 1857, the couple moved to Cincinnati, where Menken created her Jewish roots, telling a reporter that she was born Jewish. She did study Judaism and stayed with the faith, although she never formally converted. In this period, she published poetry and articles on Judaism in \"The Israelite\" in Cincinnati. The newspaper was founded by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who was crucial to the Reform Judaism movement in the United States. She also began to be published in the \"Jewish Messenger\" of New York.\n\nAda added an \"h\" to her first name and an \"s\" to Isaac, and by 1858 she billed herself as Adah Isaacs Menken. She eventually worked as an actress in New York and San Francisco, as well as in touring productions across the country. She also became known for her poetry and painting. While none of her art was well received by major critics, she became a celebrity.\n\nAt this time, Menken wore her wavy hair short, a highly unusual style for women of the time. She cultivated a bohemian and at times androgynous appearance. She deliberately created her image at a time when the growth of popular media helped to publicize it.\n\nIn 1859, Menken appeared on Broadway in New York City in the play \"The French Spy.\" Her work was not highly regarded by critics. \"The New York Times\" described her as \"the worst actress on Broadway.\" \"The Observer\" said, \"she is delightfully unhampered by the shackles of talent.\" Menken continued to perform small parts in New York, as well as reading Shakespeare in performance, and giving lectures.\n\nHer third husband was John C. Heenan, a popular Irish-American prizefighter whom she married in 1859. Some time after their marriage, the press discovered she did not yet have a legal divorce from Menken and accused her of bigamy. She had expected Menken to handle the divorce, which he eventually did.\n\nAs John Heenan was one of the most famous and popular figures in America, the press also accused Menken of marrying for his celebrity. She billed herself as Mrs. Heenan in Boston, Providence, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, using his name despite their divorce within a year of marriage. They had a son, who died soon after birth.\n\nWhile in New York, Menken met the poet Walt Whitman and some others of his bohemian circle. She was influenced by his work and began to write in a more confessional style while adhering to common sentimental conventions of the time. In 1860-61, she published 25 poems in the \"Sunday Mercury,\" an entertainment newspaper in New York. These were later collected with six more in her only book, \"Infelicia,\" published a few months after her death. By publishing in a newspaper, she reached a larger audience than through women's magazines, including both men and women readers who might go to see her perform as an actress.\n\nIn 1860, Menken wrote a review titled \"Swimming Against the Current,\" which praised Whitman's new edition of \"Leaves of Grass,\" saying he was \"centuries ahead of his contemporaries.\" She identified with the controversial poet, and declared her bohemian identity through her support for him. That year, Menken also wrote an article on the 1860 election, an unusual topic for a woman, which further added to her image.\n\nWhen Menken met Charles Blondin, notable for crossing Niagara Falls on a tightrope, the two were quickly attracted to each other. She suggested she would marry him if they could perform a couple's act above the falls. Blondin refused, saying that he would be \"distracted by her beauty.\" The two had an affair, during which they conducted a vaudeville tour across the United States.\n\nAfter it ended, she appealed to her business manager Jimmie Murdock to help her become recognized as a great actress. Murdock dissuaded Menken from that goal, as he knew she had little acting talent. He offered her the \"breeches role\" (that of a man) of the noble Tartar in the hippodrama \"Mazeppa,\" based on the poem of that title by Lord Byron (an ultimately on the life of Ivan Mazepa). At the climax of this hit, the Tartar was stripped of his clothing, tied to his horse, and sent off to his death. The audiences were thrilled with the scene, although the production used a dummy strapped to a horse, which was led away by a handler giving sugar cubes. Menken wanted to perform the stunt herself. Dressed in nude tights and riding a horse on stage, she appeared to be naked and caused a sensation. New York audiences were shocked but still attended and made the play popular.\n\nMenken took the production of \"Mazeppa\" to San Francisco. Audiences again flocked to the show. She became known across the country for this role, and San Francisco adopted her as its performer.\n\nIn 1862, she married Robert Henry Newell, a humorist and editor of the \"Sunday Mercury\" in New York, who had recently published most of her poetry. They were together about three years. Next she wed James Paul Barkley, a gambler, in 1866, but soon returned without him to France, where she was performing. There she had their son, whom she named Louis Dudevant Victor Emanuel Barkley. The baby's godmother was the author George Sand (A. F. Lesser). Louis died in infancy.\nMenken arranged to play in a production of \"Mazeppa\" in London and France for much of 1864 to 1866. Controversy arose over her costume, and she responded to critics in the newspapers of London by saying that she was influenced by classical sculpture, and that her costume was more modest than those of ballet or burlesque. The show opened on October 3, 1864, at the Astley Theatre to \"overflowing houses.\" She was so well known that she was referred to as \"the Menken,\" needing no other name.\n\nJokes and poems were printed about the controversy, and \"Punch\" wrote:\nHere's half the town - if bills be true -<br>\nTo Astley's nightly thronging,<br> \nTo see the Menken throw aside<br>\nAll to her sex belonging,<br>\nStripping off woman's modesty,<br>\nWith woman's outward trappings -<br> \nA barebacked jade on barebacked steed,<br>\nIn Cartlich's old strappings!\n\nDuring this time of her greatest earning, she was generous to friends, theatre people in need, and charities. While in Europe, the Menken continued to play to the American public as well, in terms of her image. As usual, she attracted a crowd of male admirers, including such prominent figures as the writer Charles Dickens, the humorist Tom Hood, and the dramatist and novelist Charles Reade.\n\nPlaying in a sold-out run of \"Les pirates de la savanne\" in Paris in 1866, Menken had an affair with the French novelist Alexandre Dumas, père, considered somewhat scandalous as he was more than twice her age. Returning to England in 1867, she struggled to attract audiences to \"Mazeppa\" and attendance fell off. During this time she had an affair with the English poet Algernon Charles Swinburne.\n\nShe fell ill in London and was forced to stop performing, struggling with poverty as a result. She began preparing her poems for publication and moved back to Paris, where she died in 1868. She had just written to a friend: \nI am lost to art and life. Yet, when all is said and done, have I not at my age tasted more of life than most women who live to be a hundred? It is fair, then, that I should go where old people go.\n\nShe was believed to have died of peritonitis and/or tuberculosis. Late twentieth-century sources suggest she had cancer. She was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery.\n\nThe inscription on her tomb read - \"Thou knowest.\" In 1862, Menken had written about her public and private personae: \nI have always believed myself to be possessed of two souls, one that lives on the surface of life, pleasing and pleased; the other as deep and as unfathomable as the ocean; a mystery to me and all who know me.\n\nHer only book, \"Infelicia\", a collection of 31 poems, was published several days after her death.\n\nMenken wanted to be known as a writer, but her work was overshadowed by her sensational stage career and private and public life. In total, she published about 20 essays, 100 poems and a book of her collected poems, from 1855 to 1868; the book was published posthumously. Her work was not received well by contemporary critics. George Merriam Hyde, one of the most respected critics of his day, refused to critique Menken's work, saying (privately) that \"it would be an insult to himself and his profession\". Van Wyck Brooks joked (in public) that \"her work is the best example of unintentional wit and accidental humour\".\n\nHer early work was devoted to family and romance. After her marriage to Menken and her study of Judaism, her poetry and essays for years into the 1860s featured Jewish themes. After her marriage and divorce from Heenan and meeting with writers in New York, she changed her style, adopting some influence from Walt Whitman. She was said to be the \"first poet and the only woman poet before the twentieth century\" to follow his lead in using free verse. However, the New York Times reported the Walt Whitman had disassociated himself from Menken's work, implying he thought little of it.\n\nBeginning in New York, her poetry expressed a wider range of emotions related to relationships, sexuality, and also about women's struggle to find a place in the world. Her collection \"Infelicia\" went through several editions and was in print until 1902. In the late nineteenth century, critics were hard on women writers, and Menken's public notoriety caused even more critical scrutiny of her poems. Later critics (such as A. R. Lloyd in his book, 'The Great Prize Fight' and Graham Gordon in his book 'Master of the Ring') generally dismiss her work as being devoid of talent. However, admirers included Christina Rossetti and Joaquin Miller.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2220553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220553", "title": "Joseph W. Tkach", "text": "Joseph W. Tkach\n\nJoseph W. Tkach (; March 16, 1927 – September 23, 1995) was the appointed successor of Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God. Tkach became President and Pastor General of the church upon the death of Armstrong in 1986. Tkach spearheaded a major doctrinal transformation of the Worldwide Church of God, abandoning Armstrong's unconventional doctrines and bringing the church into accord with orthodox evangelical Christianity. His son, Joseph Tkach Jr., continued his work and in 1997 the Worldwide Church of God became a member of the National Association of Evangelicals.\n\nDuring Tkach's tenure, the changes that he implemented stirred much controversy and significant dissent among those who continued to follow Armstrong's theology. The dissenters labeled the changes as heresy and many left to form new church organizations. Within the mainstream Christian community, some have hailed Tkach's reforms, which brought a church from the fringe to orthodoxy, as unprecedented.\n\nHe was born March 16, 1927, in Chicago, the youngest of five children and the only son of Vassil and Mary Tkach. The name Tkach is of Carpatho-Rusyn (Ukrainian) origin, but his parents were originally from Czechoslovakia. The neighborhood where he grew up was composed mainly of blue-collar working people of Russian origin. He graduated from Tilden High School in southwest Chicago. He then served a short term in the U.S. Navy near the end of World War II and afterward returned to his native Chicago. On March 31, 1951, Tkach married Elaine Apostolos; they had three children: Joseph Jr., Tanya, and Jennifer.\n\nTkach grew up in the Russian Orthodox faith, but eventually his family, including his parents, became interested in the Radio Church of God through the radio broadcast of Herbert W. Armstrong, the founder of the church. The Radio Church of God would eventually change its name in 1968 to the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), the church that Tkach would lead. It was a church characterized by the strong influence of its founder and his unique doctrines based on his own interpretation of the Bible. Initially, Tkach was the only member of his family who was not interested in listening to the radio broadcasts. However, a purportedly miraculous event was to change him. At the time, Tkach suffered from severe ulcers and was required to stay on a special diet. His wife then suggested that God would heal him if he were to become a minister in Armstrong's church. Although skeptical, he accepted the suggestion of becoming a minister and he found himself cured, never again to suffer from the ulcers. He was baptized by Radio Church of God minister, Dean Blackwell, on March 1, 1957. On June 7, 1961, Blackwell ordained him a deacon in the Chicago congregation, and on June 3, 1963, Roderick C. Meredith, who would eventually lead a breakaway church from the WCG, ordained him as an elder.\n\nIn 1966 Tkach moved his family to Pasadena, California, where he enrolled in classes at Ambassador College, a state-approved, but not regionally accredited, college that was sponsored by the WCG. In 1974, he was ordained to the rank of preaching elder. Armstrong taught that the Bible endorsed \"ranks\" in the ministry, and elders could progress up the ladder from local elder to preaching elder to pastor to evangelist. The highest rank, apostle, was reserved for the leader of the church.\n\nIn the late 1970s a period of financial and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, at the center of many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church being placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took an active role in the defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.\n\nArmstrong had recovered from severe heart problems in the late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months. According to \"The Worldwide News\", the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him in the event of his death. It was also announced by Armstrong in a letter to members of the church. Armstrong died on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming his successor.\n\nInitially there were few visible changes within the church. Tkach continued Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth during the early years of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should tithe, giving a tenth of their gross income to the church. The church magazine, \"The Plain Truth\", continued to serialize the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, \"Mystery of the Ages\". Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.\n\nTkach did not have the charismatic personality of his predecessor. Unlike Armstrong, who kept a strong hold of the reins, Tkach delegated many tasks, including the presentation of the church-supported television broadcast, \"The World Tomorrow\" and the authoring of articles and booklets produced by the church. Although Tkach was not known as a theologian, and made no claims as such, eventually he was to have profound impact on the theological foundations of the WCG.\n\nThe first major change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's doctrine on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God and not by doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied with the results of the study, he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.\n\nAnother officially published doctrinal change was that women in the church would be allowed to wear makeup. In the earliest years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women. In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.\n\nThe first major sign of dissent occurred in 1989 when a WCG minister, Gerald Flurry, published a manuscript outlining what he and others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including the beginnings of the doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. Flurry and another minister, John Amos, were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and over the next several years a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including:  the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage; the allowance of work on the Sabbath; the acceptance of the trinitarian doctrine; and the acceptance of the validity of other Christian denominations, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print. However, in order to settle legal matters between WCG and splinter group PCG, WCG agreed to sell PCG the copyrights to many of Armstrong's publications, allowing PCG to continue to publish them.\n\nAs these reforms were being carried out, questions arose as to whether the decisions were truly made by Tkach himself or by others in the church leadership. The church leadership at that time included Mike Feazell, executive assistant and editorial advisor to Tkach, Greg Albrecht, editor of \"The Plain Truth\", and Joseph Tkach, Jr., the son of Joseph W. Tkach, and church administration director. One conspiracy theory stated that the decisions did not come from Tkach himself but from the church leadership. Another stated that the ideas did originate from Tkach but he formed them early in his career, kept them hidden from Armstrong, and only allowed the ideas to come to fruition after Armstrong's death. Feazell claims that the reforms were initially driven by a re-examination of church literature that was mainly spurred by questions posed by church ministers and members. These examinations were done by Tkach and Feazell, but the final decisions and approval of materials for publication were made by Tkach. By 1990, Tkach authorized the formation of a \"Doctrinal Manual Group\", consisting of thirteen ministers and Ambassador College faculty members with the mission of assuring doctrinal consistency, refinement, and advice to the Pastor General. Tkach reviewed and made the final decisions on all recommendations made by the group.\n\nThe church's traditions of following the Sabbath, the Old Testament holy days, and tithing were initially retained. But some WCG ministers and members continued to express alarm over the doctrinal revisions Tkach had already made, and from time to time some would leave to create dissident branches. They included Tkach's one-time mentor, Roderick C. Meredith, who formed the Global Church of God in 1992. As various breakaway groups were established, additional clusters of church members followed.\n\nThe doctrinal changes in the church occurred gradually, but by 1994, most of the concepts of Armstrongism had been largely modified or discontinued. However, the major bombshell was dropped during what is now called the Christmas Eve Sermon. Tapes of Tkach's sermon (dated January 7, 1995) were delivered to local congregations for viewing. In this sermon, he publicly declared that the Worldwide Church of God was a New Covenant church and, therefore, not bound by the terms of the Old Covenant. Christian theology defines the Old Covenant as the Mosaic Law embodied in the Torah. Hence, by making this statement, Tkach officially dropped all doctrines based on Mosaic Law (i.e., the keeping of the Sabbath, the Holy Days, and the dietary laws), making observance of such practices an individual choice. He also dropped the requirement of tithing, declaring that giving as taught in the New Testament was voluntary. The last change had a significant and rather immediate impact on church finances.\n\nThese and other major changes brought about major defections among ministers and members, which in turn contributed to a further drop in church revenue. In order to bring the finances in order, major changes in the church infrastructure were implemented. \"The World Tomorrow\", which had seen record numbers of viewers in the early years of the Tkach administration, was stopped. \"The Plain Truth\" publication runs were reduced. Staff at the church headquarters were laid off. The famous, church-subsidized Ambassador Auditorium concert series was canceled and offers were sought for the purchase of the Ambassador College Pasadena campus.\n\nThe Christmas Eve sermon only accelerated the departure of church members. A new branch, the United Church of God, was created in 1995 by a conference of departing ministers and named Tkach's one-time associate and former \"The World Tomorrow\" presenter, David Hulme, as president. It eventually became the largest of the groups to break away from the WCG during this period. Although revenues continued to drop, Tkach remained steadfastly committed to the changes that he had implemented.\n\nOn May 12, 1995 Tkach had surgery to remove his gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the hospital because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach announced that he was also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.\n\nTkach died on September 23, 1995.\n\nThe impact of Tkach's tenure as the head of the WCG was notable. Church income dropped from a high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The circulation of \"The Plain Truth\", distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry. The number of employees at the church headquarters fell from 1,000 to about 50. Ambassador University, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 as the church could no longer provide its annual operating subsidy. The Pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004.\n\nIn assessing the work of Tkach, there are two points of view. The critics of Tkach, especially those who formed the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for the collapse of the WCG. They believe that the changes he brought were a turn against God and say his rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation.\n\nTkach's supporters, including those in the leadership of the WCG, see events differently. The WCG describes Tkach's tenure as \"A Decade of Painful Change\" and that the end result of his work was the reconciliation of the church with mainstream Christianity. Ruth Tucker, an evangelical leader and an early supporter of the changes which occurred in the WCG, wrote in an article in \"Christianity Today\" that\nThe \"changes\"—as they are referred to by insiders—are truly historic. Never before in the history of Christianity has there been such a complete move to orthodox Christianity by an unorthodox fringe church.\nVern Bullough, a secular humanist and senior editor of \"Free Inquiry\", commented on the significance of the changes noting:\nThe shedding of almost every doctrine the Worldwide Church of God once clung to is a story almost without parallel in American religious history.\n\nAfter his death, the WCG reiterated its full acceptance of the doctrinal changes implemented by Tkach and published an apology to current and former members of the church for the impact previous doctrines had had on members. As evidence that Tkach's work was instrumental in the move toward mainstream Christianity, the WCG was accepted into the membership of the National Association of Evangelicals within two years of his death.\n\n"}
{"id": "2220555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220555", "title": "Cadaver (video game)", "text": "Cadaver (video game)\n\nCadaver is an isometric action-adventure game by the Bitmap Brothers, originally released by Image Works in August 1990, for Atari ST, Amiga and MS-DOS. In the game the player controls Karadoc the dwarf.\n\nIn the original \"Cadaver\", Karadoc, who is a gold-hungry dwarf and really just hopes to find a treasure, is on a mission to seek out and kill the necromancer Dianos, the sole remaining inhabitant of Castle Wulf.\n\nThe game consists of five levels representing different floors of Castle Wulf. Entering the castle via the sewers, Karadoc works his way up from the dungeons, through guard chambers, royal hall, the king's private chambers and finally the battlements with Dianos's sanctum.\n\nKaradoc's main modus operandi is picking up, throwing, pulling, pushing and stacking objects. By piling up a number of boxes, bones or other items, it is possible to reach higher places. Karadoc can find and use a small number of weapons such as rocks and shuriken, but puzzles are the main driving force behind the gameplay.\n\nThe game is heavily scripted. The isometric objects can react to a variety of other objects; for instance, a poisoned key can be cleaned by dropping a vial of water on it, and potions can be enhanced by the potion booster spell. The game has a wide variety of puzzles requiring items to be found, brought and used in a variety of places. The solutions to these puzzles sometimes require leaps in logic and the game has plenty of secret areas, hidden spells etc. Many of the puzzles also have multiple solutions, and there is often no specific order in which the puzzles on a level must be solved.\n\nThe game is played using a joystick, with which you can control the movement of Karadoc in 8 directions. The directions are not as one would expect in a game from today - instead, they are rotated. If you push the joystick up, Karadoc will run \"north\", which is right-up on the screen. If you want Karadoc to move up on the screen (which is \"north-west\" in the game), you need to push the joystick left-up. The fire button of the joystick is used to jump.\n\nWhen Karadoc touches an object, he can push it around, unless it is too heavy (a potion of strength allows pushing heavier objects). Touching an object also causes the context menu to be enabled. When the context menu is enabled, the fire button is used to select an action from the menu instead of jumping. The possible actions depend on the type of object, and are represented with icons. They include things like \"investigate\", \"pull\", \"pick up\", \"drink\", \"open\", \"insert\", \"give\" and some others. Items which are picked up land in Karadocs inventory, and get additional actions, like \"cast\" for spells. One item at a time also can be readied, usually a weapon, which makes the fire button throw or use the readied item instead of jumping.\n\n\"Cadaver\" was initially developed as a level building tool on the Atari ST for adventure games, named the \"Adventure Level Editor\", which was used to create \"Cadaver's\" levels. Levels in \"ALE\" are initially created as a two-dimensional map, in which the designer may define the size of each room (within the range of 3 x 3 to 10 x 10 tiles) and show interconnections between each room. After a room is created, is it converted to 3D, and background details and objects are added manually.\n\n\"Cadaver\" is programmed in ACL, a programming language developed by the Bitmap Brothers' Steve Kelly. Objects in \"Cadaver\" are assigned a number, and associated with that number is ACL code that indicate how the object is manipulated under different circumstances, i.e. indicating if an object can be opened or used as a container. Events such as locking and unlocking doors are also controlled by ACL.\n\nAn expansion pack titled \"Cadaver: The Payoff\" was released in 1991. After defeating Dianos, Karadoc returns to the inn only to find his employers gone, and every living person within the city either dead or transformed into a monster. Seeking the cause behind this, the dwarf fights his way to the local temple, and finds the answers - and his money - deep down in the crypts.\n\nGameplay is similar. \"Cadaver: The Payoff\" has only four levels, but they are significantly larger than those of the first game, and the second level has a large number of monsters and scant possibilities to heal.\n\nThere are three levels besides the nine from the two official releases:\n\n\nThe game was received very well at its release. The Atari version was awarded as \"C+VG HIT\" in \"Computer and Video Games magazine\" issue 107 in 1990. In the same year, the Amiga version received a \"CU Screen Star\" from \"CU Amiga Magazine\"\n\n\"The One\" gave the Amiga version of \"Cadaver: The Pay-Off\" an overall score of 88%, calling it a \"worthwhile\" expansion and expressing that it has \"improvements in almost every department\" over the original \"Cadaver\". \"The One\" praises \"The Pay-Off's\" new content and similar difficulty, stating that \"Players who have completed \"Cadaver\" will enjoy the greater variety and continued challenge\".\n\nAccording to the official site, it has received the following awards:\n\n"}

The ratio relates the aircraft airspeed to the rudder deflection setting that is in effect at the time. As an aircraft accelerates, the deflection of the rudder needs to be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot. This automatic reduction process is needed because if the rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high-speed flight, it will cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw, or swing from side to side, leading to loss of control and rudder, tail and other damages, even causing the aircraft to crash.\n\n"}
{"id": "2220573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220573", "title": "Organ pipe mud dauber", "text": "Organ pipe mud dauber\n\nThe organ pipe mud dauber (\"Trypoxylon politum\") is a predatory wasp in the family Crabronidae. They are fairly large wasps, ranging from 3.9–5.1 cm, and have been recorded to fly from May to September. Female and male are similar in colour, a shiny black with pale yellow to white hind hindtarsomere. The organ pipe mud dauber feeds mainly on three genera of spider: Neoscona, Araneus, and Eustala. Melittobia, a parasitoid wasp, is a common ectoparasite of \"T. politum\" prepupae. Other sources of parasitism include the Bombyliid fly Anthrax, Chrysidid wasps, and various species of scavenger flies (Miltogramminae). The tufted titmouse (\"Parus bicolor\") is a known predator of \"T. politum\", and may feed on them more commonly than previously thought as the holes made by the titmouse are similar in shape and size to those made by T. politum leaving the nest after pupation.\n\nOrgan pipe mud daubers are also an exceedingly docile species of wasp, and generally pleasant to have around, as they serve to keep spider populations down. Stings to humans are only in self-defence, such as if a wasp is squeezed. There are a great many other species in the genus \"Trypoxylon\" (over 700 worldwide), mostly smaller in size and less abundant.\n\nThe Organ pipe mud dauber ranges from Southeastern Canada to Eastern United States Mud daubers use tree holes or the underside of bridges to construct their nests out of mud. Nest site choice usually depends on 3 specifications: a smooth vertical surface with ample shade and rainfall protection, a source of mud nearby, as well as an adjacent forest. The females form long mud tubes consisting of multiple cells, which they will fortify with paralyzed spiders. The female then lays an egg in each cell, leaves the nest and, once hatched, the larvae feed on the spiders. The larvae then pupate until they become adults. A female can either; build a new nest, use an abandoned one, challenge another female making one and claim it as her own, or (on rare occasion) enter a freshly constructed one and remove the egg to replace it with her own. The female constructs, on average, 5 to 6 pipes in a cluster. These pipes can either be built side-by-side or on top of each other. When pipes are added in layers, the survivability of the freshly hatched adults decreases as they chew their way out of a pipe to emerge. The more pipes clustered on top of another, the less likely the new mud daubers are to chew their way out alive. A newly hatched adult female will usually begin building her new nest within 48 hours of leaving the old nest.\n\nIn the southern populations, \"T. politum\" has a partially bivoltine life history pattern: Some wasps in these populations have offspring which emerge after winter, before the end of June. Other offspring in this geographical range overwinter and reproduce after winter. North of central Virginia the wasps have a univoltine life history pattern, and only produce one generation per year \n\nMud daubers are unique, compared to many other wasps, in that males stay at the mouth of the nest to protect the offspring. The male guards the young from intruders, parasites, and other males. This energy investment, to increase the likelihood in the survivability of their offspring, is known as parental care, and is common among many other hymenopteran, such as bees and ants. The male may also help the female in nest construction. Like other wasps, \"T Politum\" is haplodiploid. The unfertilized eggs generate males and fertilized eggs become females. Adult mothers feed the fertilized (female) eggs more than the unfertilized eggs. Because of this additional food allotment, females tend to be the larger of the two sexes. This uneven division of resources is called sex allocation. Females showed a positive correlation between body size and increased fecundity, which offers an explanation as to why there is a bias for increased female food provision and body size.\n\n"}

From Addiscombe Military Seminary he passed into the Bengal Engineers in 1836, and was employed for some years on irrigation works in the North-Western Provinces. So many members of the family were in the Indian government that sarcastic mentions were made of the \"Government of the Stracheys\".\n\nStrachey served in the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1845–46, and was at the battles of Aliwal and Sobraon, was mentioned in dispatches, and received a brevet-majority.\n\nIn 1848, with J. E. Winterbottom, he entered Tibet to explore Lakes Manasarovar and Rakshastal, which his brother Henry Strachey had visited in 1846. In 1849, the two brothers briefly re-entered Tibet by following the Niti Pass out of Garhwal.\n\nFrom 1858 to 1865 he was chiefly employed in the public works department, either as acting or permanent secretary to the government of India, and from 1867 to 1871 he filled the post of director-general of irrigation, then specially created.\n\nDuring this period the entire administration of public works was reorganised to adapt it to the increasing magnitude of the interests with which this department had to deal since its establishment by Lord Dalhousie in 1854. For this reorganisation, under which the accounts were placed on a proper footing and the forest administration greatly developed, Strachey was chiefly responsible. His work in connection with Indian finance was important. In 1867 he prepared a scheme in considerable detail for decentralising the financial administration of India, which formed the basis of the policy afterwards carried into effect by his brother Sir John Strachey under Lord Mayo and Lord Lytton.\n\nHe left India in 1871, but in 1877 he was sent there to confer with the government on the purchase of the East Indian railway, and was then selected as president of the commission of inquiry into Indian famines. In 1878 he was appointed to act for six months as financial member of the governor-general's council, when he made proposals for meeting the difficulties arising from the depreciation of the rupee, then just beginning to be serious. These proposals did not meet with the support of the secretary of state. From that time he continued to take an active part in the efforts made to bring the currencies of India and England into harmony, until in 1892 he was appointed a member of Lord Herschell's committee, which arrived at conclusions in accordance with the views put forward by him in 1878.\n\nIn 1892, Strachey attended the International Monetary Conference at Brussels as delegate for British India. He was a member of the council of the secretary of state for India from 1875 to 1889, when he resigned his seat to accept the post of chairman of the East Indian Railway Company.\nStrachey's scientific labours in connection with the geology, botany and physical geography of the Himalayas were considerable. He devoted much time to meteorological research, was largely instrumental in the formation of the Indian meteorological department, and became chairman of the meteorological council of the Royal Society in 1883. From 1888 to 1890 he was president of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1897 he was awarded one of the Royal Medals of the Royal Society, of which he became a fellow in 1854; and in the same year he was created G.C.S.I. He died on 12 February 1908.\n\nStrachey did much good work for the Royal Society, served on its council four times, from 1872 to 1874, 1880 to 1881, 1884 to 1886, and 1890 to 1891, and was twice a vice-president ; he was a member of its meteorological committee (which controlled the meteorological office) in 1867, and he was a member of the council which replaced the committee in 1876, and from 1883 to 1895 was its chairman. From 1873 he was on the committee of the Royal Society for managing the Kew observatory. The royal medal of the society was bestowed upon him in 1897 for his researches in physical and botanical geography and in meteorology, and the Royal Meteorological Society awarded him the Symons medal in 1906. His most important scientific contributions to knowledge were made in meteorology. He laid the foundations of the scientific study of Indian meteorology, organising a department whose labours have been of use in assisting to forecast droughts and consequent scarcity and of no little advantage to meteorologists generally. For years he served on the committee of solar physics. A sound mathematician, Strachey delighted in mechanical inventions and especially in designing instruments to give graphic expression to formulas he had devised for working out meteorological problems. In 1884 he designed an instrument called the 'sine curve developer' to show in a graphic form the results obtained by applying to hourly readings of barograms and thermograms his formula for the calculation of harmonic coefficients. In 1888 and 1890 he designed two 'slide rules,' one to facilitate the computation of the amplitude and time of maximum of harmonic constants from values obtained by applying his formula to hourly readings of barograms and thermograms ; the other to obtain the height of clouds from measurements of two photographs taken simultaneously with cameras placed at the ends of a base line half a mile in length. A further invention was a portable and very simple instrument, called a 'nephoscope,' for observing the direction of motion of high cirrus clouds, whose movement is generally too slow to allow of its direction being determined by the unaided eye.\n\nRichard Strachey was about 37 years old when he married Caroline Bowles, who died in 1855, within a year of their wedding.\n\nNearly four years were to pass before he married again. On 4 January 1859, the 42-year-old Richard married 18-year-old Jane Maria Grant, to be known henceforth as Jane, Lady Strachey (1840–1928). His wife was to become a well-known author and supporter of women's suffrage, who would co-lead the Mud March of 1907 in London. Sir Richard and Lady Strachey were the parents of thirteen children, of whom ten survived to adulthood; among them were:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2220582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220582", "title": "Cooperative board game", "text": "Cooperative board game\n\nCooperative board games are board games in which players work together to achieve a common goal, the result being either winning or losing as a group. As the name suggests, cooperative games stress cooperation over competition. This type of board game attracts people who enjoy the social aspect of games and is a good way to get new board game players interested in the hobby. Either the players win the game by reaching a pre-determined objective, or all players lose the game, often by not reaching the objective before a certain event ends the game.\n\nIn cooperative board games, all players win or lose the game together. These games should not be confused with \"noncompetitive\" games, such as \"The Ungame\", which simply do not have victory conditions or any set objective to complete. While adventure board games with role playing and dungeon crawl elements like \"Gloomhaven\" may be included, pure tabletop role-playing games like \"\" are excluded as they have potentially infinite victory conditions with persistent player characters. Furthermore, games in which players compete together in two or more groups, teams or partnerships (such as \"Axis & Allies\", and card games like Bridge and Spades) fall outside of this definition, even though there is temporary cooperation between some of the players. Multiplayer conflict games like \"Diplomacy\" may also feature temporary cooperation during the course of the game. These games are not considered cooperative though, because players are eliminated and ultimately only one individual can win.\n\nEarly cooperative games were used by parents and teachers in educational settings. In 1954, a board game version of Beat the Clock, a game show, was released. In 1956, the Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation of New York City released a board game version of I've Got a Secret, a panel show, featuring host Garry Moore on the cover of the box.\n\nTeacher Jim Deacove published the cooperative game \"Together\" in 1971. He founded \"Family Pastimes\" in 1972 in Perth, Ontario, focusing exclusively on cooperative games. Family Pastimes has published numerous cooperative games, having released over 100 board games including the popular game of \"Max the Cat\". The company also holds the trademark for the phrase, \"A co-operative game\".\n\nKen Kolsbun and Jann Kolsbun founded \"Animal Town\" in 1976 in California. They invented cooperative games such as \"Save the Whales\", \"Nectar Collector\", and Dam Builders. Animal Town was renamed as \"Child and Nature\" in 2003. \n\nDuring the 1980s, several cooperative games like \"The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora\", \"Time Tripper\", and \"Arkham Horror\" were published. In the series of games published in the 1980s, players are presented with a mystery to solve, and they trace the evidence together. Many cooperative Adventure board game series with Role-playing elements like \"Citadel of Blood\", \"HeroQuest\", \"Wizards (board game)\", \"Advanced HeroQuest\", \"Deathmaze\" were released in this decade. \n\nMinion Hunter is a board game originally released in 1992 by Game Designers' Workshop in conjunction with their \"Dark Conspiracy Role Playing Game\". The game is designed to encourage the players to work together to stall and/or defeat the plans of four monster races as a primary goal, with the individual advancement of the players as a secondary objective. is set in the \"Star Trek\" universe and released in 1993. It utilizes a video tape that runs constantly while users play the board game portion. Events on the video tape combine with board game play to determine whether users win or lose the game. The video itself was directed by Les Landau and contains original footage filmed on the actual \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" sets at Paramount Studios. Warhammer Quest is a fantasy dungeon, role-playing adventure board game released by Games Workshop in 1995 as the successor to \"HeroQuest\" and \"Advanced HeroQuest\", set in its fictional \"Warhammer Fantasy\" world.\n\nIn 2000, Reiner Knizia published \"Lord of the Rings\" which influenced a number of subsequent titles, including \"Shadows Over Camelot\". \"Pandemic\", designed by Matt Leacock was first published by Z-Man Games in the United States in 2008. \"Space Alert\" is a cooperative survival designer board game created by Vlaada Chvátil in 2008. Players assume the roles of space explorers on a mission to survey the galaxy. The crew is evaluated on teamwork and how they deal with problems that arise on their journey.\n\nOther cooperative games of the last 10 years include \"Star Trek: Expeditions\", \"Sentinels of the Multiverse\", , \"Zombicide\", and \"Hanabi\", which won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2013. Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative board game created by Riot Games. The game was released on October 13, 2016.\n\nIn José P. Zagal, Jochen Rick, and Idris Hsi's \"Collaborative games: Lessons learned from board games\", the lessons the researchers learned highlight what makes a good cooperative board game. \nThese researchers also point out Challenges in designing collaborative games due to the following pitfalls that must be overcome:\n\nParticipants typically play against the game. Cooperative board games generally involve players joining forces against the game itself, and can be played without any player in the role of the opposition or Gamemaster. In \"Pandemic\", for example, players work together to stop and cure different strains of diseases. \n\nAlso, in some cooperative games, players actually cooperate with the opposing forces in the game. For example, in \"Max the Cat\", players are mice who keep an aggressive cat at bay by offering him milk and other appeasements. In this way, all participants in the conflict scenario are fulfilled and the resolution is truly cooperative or \"win-win\".\n\nIn many contemporary cooperative games, randomizing devices help in varying game experience over multiple plays. Dice can be rolled, cards can be drawn each turn from a shuffled deck or various board sections of a modular board revealed to generate random objectives, events and challenges. These provide the conflict or challenge in the game, and make it progressively more difficult for the players. For example, in \"Save the Whales\", players work together to protect whales from the challenges inherent in the game setting—radioactive waste, commercial whaling, etc.\n\nThemes and objectives in cooperative games are either or both of grand scale and highly detailed. This brings an investment in the games objective and the satisfaction of succeeding against the overwhelming magnitude of the odds. The outcome of the effort is often uncertain until the very end, the games try to maintain (and often build) interest and tension.\n\nMost cooperative games bestow different abilities or responsibilities upon the players incentivizing cooperation. Some cooperative games might have an added layer of intrigue by giving players personal win conditions. In \"\", a zombie apocalypse game, in order to win players must achieve the communal victory condition and a personal objective. Gloomhaven is a cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games in 2017 where each player also has a personal objective. \n\nIn \"Scotland Yard\" and \"The Fury of Dracula\" have one player secretly controls the enemy. The other players are cooperating to locate and defeat the enemy.\n\nA \"traitor game\" can be seen as a cooperative game with a betrayal mechanism, or as a kind of team game. For this mechanism, traitors begin the game with hidden identities, or are assigned them during the game. Traitors typically win if the other players lose. In \"\", players who receive a “You Are a Cylon” card when loyalty cards are handed out work in secret to undermine humanity. Other games, like Betrayal at House on the Hill, start out fully cooperative, but assigns a player to be the villain mid-game. Such games may be separated from Cooperative board games.\n\n"}
{"id": "2220588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220588", "title": "Ahl al-Bayt", "text": "Ahl al-Bayt\n\nAhl al-Bayt (, ) is a phrase meaning \"People of the House\" , \"People of the Household\" or \"Family of the House\". Within the Islamic tradition, the term mainly refers to the family of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and to a lesser extent (according to Muslims), his ancestor Ibrahim (Abraham),\n\nIn Shia Islam, the Ahl al-Bayt are central to Islam and interpreters of the Quran and Sunnah. Shias believe they are successors of Muhammad and consist of Muhammad, his daughter Fatimah, his son-in-law Ali, and their children Hasan and Husayn, known collectively as the \"Ahl al-Kisa\" (\"People of the Cloak\"). Aside from them, Twelvers place emphasis to others of the Twelve Imams of Muhammad's descendants, with other Shi'ites placing emphasis on other descendants of his, such as Zayd ibn Ali (in the case of Zaydis) and Isma'il ibn Ja'far (in the case of Isma'ilites).\n\nIn Sunni Islam, Muhammad's Ahl al-Bayt also refers to Muhammad himself; his Fatima (R.A); her sons Hussain (R.A), Hassan (R.A), Ali(R.A); his daughters Zainab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah; his cousin and son-in-law Ali and their two sons, Hasan and Husayn. In the interpretation of certain traditions, the term may also be extended to include the descendants of Muhammad's paternal uncles, Abu Talib and al-'Abbas, or according to Malik ibn Anas and Abu Hanifa, all of the Banu Hashim.\n\nIn this topic, the word \"ahl al-bayt\" is treated base on the Quranic verse, in line with the commentary. To sum up, the meaning of \"ahl al-bayt\" in the Quran follows the accepted usage of the term in pre- and post-Islamic Arab society. It denotes family and blood relations as well as a noble and leading \"house\" of the tribe.\n\nThe term \"Ahl\" signifies the members of a household of a man, including his fellow tribesmen, kin, relatives, wife or wives, children and all those who share a family background, religion, housing, city and country with him.\n\"Bayt\" refers to habitation and dwelling, whether tented or built. It can also be roughly translated as \"household\". The \"ahl al-bayt\" of a person refers to his family members and all those who live in his house. \"Ahl al-Bayt\" is the polite form of addressing the members and wife of the family.\n\nThe Qur'an uses the term \"Ahl al-Bayt\" many times as a term of respect for Prophet's family, and to the Prophet Muhammad's blood relations. According to \"the Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought\", \"The term \"ahl al-bayt\" (the people of the house) is used in the Qur'an as a term of respect for wives, referring to Abraham's wife Sarah (Q. ), for example, and to the Prophet Muhammad's family only from bloodline, not the wives, they are declared to be purified by divine act: 'God's wish is to remove uncleanness from you' (Q.).\"\n\nAccording to some interpretations, the Qur'an also implicitly refers to Ahl al-Bayt in , using the term \"al-qurbā\".\n\nThere has been much debate concerning which people constitute \"ahl al-bayt\". \nAccording to the site Islam Question and Answer, \nThere are several views among the scholars ... concerning the definition of Ahl al-Bayt. \nWith regard to the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the most correct view is that they are included among the members of the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because Allaah says, after commanding the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to observe hijaab (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Allaah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet), and to purify you with a thorough purification” (al-Ahzaab ]\n\nAlthough there have been many disagreements, there is a consensus amongst Sunni and Shi'a Muslims that the \"Ahl al-Kisa\" \"hadith\" refers specifically to Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn. Mention of the \"ahl al-bayt\", Muhammad's household, is present in a verse of the Qur'an as follows:\nThe precise definition of the term in this verse has been subject to varying interpretations. In one tradition, according to which Muhammad's companion Salman al-Farsi is included as a member, it is used to distinguish from the \"muhajirun\" (Muslim emigrants from Mecca) and \"ansar\" (Medinan converts to Islam). According to Sunni doctrine, the term includes the wives and dependants of Muhammad, as it addresses them in the preceding verse – an interpretation which is attributed to 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas and Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl, both of whom were companions of Muhammad. This is supported by various traditions attributed to Muhammad wherein he addresses each of his wives as \"Ahl al-Bayt\". Further members of the household, according to the Sunni perspective, include Ali, Fatimah,Hasan and Husayn, who are mentioned in the tradition of the mantle. Some versions of this tradition recognise Umm Salamah, a wife of Muhammad, as a part of the household. Thus, according to the \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\", \"the current orthodox view is based on a harmonizing opinion, according to which the term \"ahl al-bayt\" includes the \"ahl al-ʿabāʾ\", i.e. the Prophet, ʿAlī, Fāṭima, al-Ḥasan and al-Ḥussain, together with the wives of the Prophet.\" According to Laura Veccia Vaglieri in Encyclopaedia of Islam \"there is a story narrated in many traditions according to which Muḥammad sheltered under his cloak, in varying circumstances including the Mubahala, his grandchildren Ḥasan and Hussein, his daughter Fatimah and his son/cousin-in-law Ali; and therefore it is these five who are given the title Ahl al-Kisa or \"People of the Mantle\". Some have attempted to add Muḥammad's wives to the list; however, the number of the privileged is limited to these five.\"\n\nOther interpretations include the family of Ali, as well as the families of Muhammad's relatives such as Aqeel, Ja'far, and al-Abbas. Early Islamic jurists Malik ibn Anas and Abū Ḥanīfa included the clan of Banu Hashim within the definition, while al-Shafi'i included the whole of Banu Muttalib.\n\nIn Shia thought, the household is limited to Muhammad, Fatimah, Ali, Hasan, Husayn, and their descendants (altogether known as the \"Ahl al-Kisa\"); as per their deduction from the tradition of the mantle. They interpret the change in pronoun in the Qur'anic verse as showing that only the aforementioned members constitute \"Ahl al-Bayt\". Madelung writes that \"this change of gender has inevitably contributed to the birth of various accounts of a legendary character, attaching the latter part of the verse to the five People of the Mantle.\" Shias view these individuals as infallible and sinless Imams and regard devotion to them as an essential part of the religion.\n\nShia Muslims also support this claim with a \"hadith\" mentioned in the Sunni \"Ṣaḥīḥ\" collection. Many Sunni scholars remark that the verse of purification was revealed concerning five people: Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn.\n\nThe tradition about this \"hadith\" goes from different sources to Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad. She narrated that once her father visited her home, he had fever and was not feeling well, he asked for a Yemeni cloak which Fatimah brought to him and folded it around him. Later he was joined in that Yemeni cloak by his grandsons Hasan and Hussein, who were followed by their father Ali ibn Abi Talib, who was cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. Finally Fatimah asked the permission to enter that cloak. When all five of them joined together under the cloak, Muhammad narrated the Qur'anic verse 33:33 to those under the cloak that all five of them are chosen ones, and he further stated that he wants God to keep all impurities out of reach and away from all of us. Muhammad then prayed to God to declare all five of them as his Ahlul Bayt and keep away the \"Najasat\" (impurities). God, at that request immediately sent Gabriel (Jibral) to reveal to Muhammad that all the five under the cloak are dearest and closest to God and they are \"Taher\" (\"purest of the pure\") without any traces of impurities.\n\nThe Twelver and Ismaili branches of Shia Islam differ in regards to the line of Imamate. While the Twelver believe in a lineage known as the Twelve Imams, the Ismaili believe that the descendants of Isma'il ibn Jafar, rather than his brother Musa al-Kadhim, were the inheritors of the Imamate instead.\n\nAccording to Anas ibn Malik, Muhammad, for six months straight used to pass by the door of Fatimah whenever he left for fajr prayers and said, \"it is time for salat, of family of the house (Ahel al biat)! 'Surely Allah desires to remove all imperfection from you, of family of the house, and purify you completely. From surah Al Ahzab 33, verse 33, Sunan al-Tirmidhi- Vol. 2 sahih 902\n\nMost, but not all Shi'a believe that these \"A'immah\" to be the divinely chosen leaders of the Muslim community. This is based on the hadith, \"People of the Cloak\", where the Prophet referred to only Fatimah, Ali, Hasan, Hussain and Himself (stating that wives were not part of the Ahl al Bayt because they could be divorced and were no longer part of the household when their husband died), a hadith which many Sunni Muslims believe in. Collectively Muhammad, Fatimah and the Twelve Imams are known as The Fourteen Infallibles.\n\nIn Kitab al-Kafi, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir has narrated that there will be twelve Imams from the family of Muhammad, nine from the family of Husayn ibn Ali, the last being Al-Qa'im, and they will be spoken to by angels.\n\nMuslims accord Muhammad's household a special status and venerate it. This is derived from verses in the Qur'an and \"hadith\" which stipulate love towards Muhammad's relatives – though in some cases interpretations differ, an example being: \"Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin\". According to classical exegete al-Tabarani (260–360 AH873–970 CE) the verse most likely refers to Muslim believers related by blood ties. Another interpretation adopted by Shia applies the verse to the \"ahl al-bayt\"; while another view interprets the verse as commanding love for relatives in general. The latter view is favored by contemporary academic scholar Madelung.\n\n\"Sharia\" (Islamic law) prohibits the administration of \"sadaqah\" (charity) or \"zakat\" (tax) to Muhammad's kin (including the Banu Hashim), as Muhammad forbade this income for himself and his family. The explanation given by jurists is that these alms are considered the defilements of the people, who offer them to purify themselves from sin, hence it would be unbecoming of the kin to handle or use them. Instead, they are accorded part of the spoils of war. Muslims in their daily prayers invoke blessings upon them by saying: \"O God, bless Muhammad and his family.\" In many Muslim communities, high social status is attributed to people claiming to be blood-descendants of Muhammad's household, and are labelled \"sayyids\" or \"sharifs\".\n\nMost Sunni Sufi circles (\"tariqah\") trace their spiritual chain back to Muhammad through Ali. In Shia thought, Muhammad's household is central to the religion. In one version of Muhammad's farewell sermon, he is represented as saying that God has given believers two safeguards: the Qur'an and his family; in other versions the two safeguards are the Qur'an and his Sunnah (statements and actions of Muhammad). Popular Shia belief ascribes cosmological importance to the family in various texts, wherein it is said that God would not have created \"Jannah\" (heaven) and earth, paradise, Adam and Eve, or anything else were it not for them. The majority of Shia regard the heads of the family as divinely chosen Imams who are infallible and sinless.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The former settled at Midleton, between Cork and Youghal in 1641; and his son Alan Brodrick (1660–1728), Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was created Baron Brodrick in 1715 and Viscount Midleton in 1717 in the Irish peerage.\n\nIn 1796 the title of Baron Brodrick in the Peerage of Great Britain was created. The English family seat at Peper Harrow, near Godalming, Surrey, was designed by Sir William Chambers. The 8th Viscount Midleton was a conservative in politics, holding seats West Surrey and Guildford in the House of Commons (November 1885 - January 1906), and who was responsible in the House of Lords for carrying the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 which filled the lacuna in the law to protect new borns such as those who have not yet breathed and provide duplicatory protection for late abortions. He was educated at Windlesham, Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he served as president of the Oxford Union. He was awarded a Doctorate of Laws (LLD) by Trinity College, Dublin. He owned, in submissions from his landowning heyday, about .\n\nHe maintained three homes: Peper Harow (House); 34 Portland Place, London (telephone number on the Langham exchange); Midleton (House), Ireland. His family-settled land was probated before his widow's death in 1943 at and £55,624 in other assets in 1942.\n\nBrodrick entered Parliament as Conservative member for West Surrey in 1880.\n\nIn 1883 he was appointed to a Royal Commission examining the condition of Irish prisons. He was Financial Secretary to the War Office 1886–92; Under-Secretary of State for War, 1895–1898; Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1898–1900; Secretary of State for War, 1900–1903; and Secretary of State for India, 1903–05.\n\nHe was Secretary of State for War during most of the Second Boer War (1899-1902). He thus had the responsibility of defending the British use of concentration camps in parliament. The conflict itself showed that the British army was not prepared for the guerrilla war of the Boers. He therefore initiated (though successors played a bigger part) a period of reform of the British army, which was focused on lessening the emphasis placed on mounted units in combat. In September 1902, Brodrick and Lord Roberts, the Commander-in-Chief of the army, visited Germany as guests to attend the German army maneuvers.\n\nIn 1904, during a crisis in British relations with Russia, he became the first member of a Cabinet since 1714 to attend a meeting of the Privy Council without being summoned to it by the monarch. At the general election of January 1906, the outcome of which was a Liberal win (the biggest landside except for that of the 1931 National Government's Conservatives), he lost his Parliamentary seat, at Guildford, which he had held since 1885. From March 1907 to 1913 he was an alderman of London County Council.\n\nFrom 1910 he was regarded as the nominal leader of the Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA) in Southern Ireland, while Sir Edward Carson led the party in Ulster (the Ulster Unionist Council). Many Irish followers and sympathisers saw him has remote or condescending, reliant on a few intimates and suspected he was more interested in promotion in British politics. In 1916 Midleton's lobbying helped to defeat an attempt to implement immediate Home Rule with Ulster exclusion; this was supported by the Ulster leader Edward Carson and the Home Ruler John Redmond, but Midleton believed it would be disastrous for the Southern Unionist minority.\n\nIn 1918, during the second, final year of his service on the Irish Convention, he tried to reach a compromise with Redmond which would allow Home Rule without partition subject to certain financial restrictions. This was rejected both by Redmond's followers (who saw it as too restrictive) and the hardline IUA rank-and-file, who deposed Midleton. He and his followers then formed the Unionist Anti-Partition League, an elite body mainly concerned with lobbying. It had some influence on the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, but none of the safeguards for Southern Unionist interests which it sought were included in the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. Successful lobbying by Midleton and associated Southern Unionists was instrumental in ensuring their representation in the Seanad of the Irish Free State.\n\nHis speeches and/or questions in Parliament were in each year from 1880 to 1941 except 1906 when he held no seat, and numbered 7584, the last of which was a tribute to the passing of Lord Baden Powell.\n\nHe was sworn into the Privy Counsel as of 1897. During his 1902 visit to Germany, he received the Grand Cross of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle.\n\nHe received the Honorary Freedom and was appointed a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Broderers in 1902, his family having been associated with the company since the early 17th century.\n\nHe was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick (KP) on 18 April 1916. \n\nIn the 1920 New Year Honours he was elevated in the British peerage system to Earl of Midleton, which became extinct with the death of his son in 1979. From 1930 he was High Steward of the Borough of Kingston upon Thames.\n\nHe married, first in 1880, Lady Hilda (died 1901), daughter of The 10th Earl of Wemyss, by whom he had five children; and secondly in 1903, Madeleine Stanley, daughter of The Baroness St Helier by her first husband. His children by the first wife were:\n\nHis grandson Sir Julian St. John Loyd (by Lady Moyra) became land agent to Queen Elizabeth II at Sandringham. His daughter, Alexandra (Mrs Duncan Byatt), was a Lady-in-Waiting to Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nHis sister, Marian Cecilia married Sir James Whitehead, son of the inventor Robert Whitehead. Sir James Whitehead was to become the British Ambassador to Austria, and his niece Agathe was the first wife of Georg Johannes von Trapp; the story of their children and his second wife, Maria von Trapp, was the basis of the musical \"The Sound of Music\". \n\nAnother, Albinia, became an early supporter of Sinn Féin and became well known in Ireland under the name Gobnait Ní Bhruadair. \n\nAnother, Edith later Mrs. Lyttleton Gell was a published author of at least 24 works such as \"The Cloud of Witness: A daily sequence of great thoughts from many minds\" and autobiography, \"Under Three Reigns: 1860-1944\".\n\n\n"}

He was the second-born son of the politician Eleftherios Venizelos.\n\nDuring World War I he served with distinction in the Greek Army and in the initial phases of the Asia Minor campaign, reaching the rank of Captain of Infantry.\n\nHe resigned from the Army and was elected as a MP with his father's Liberal Party in the 1920 elections.\n\nIn 1941, after the Axis occupation of Greece, he became ambassador to the United States, representing the Greek government in exile based in Cairo. He became a minister of that government in 1943 under Prime Minister Emmanuel Tsuderos, and briefly its Prime Minister in 1944 (April 13–26).\n\nAfter the end of the war, he returned to Greece; where he became Vice President of the Liberal Party (led by Themistoklis Sofoulis) and a minister in the first post-war government led by Georgios Papandreou.\n\nIn 1948 he assumed the leadership of the party and became a minister in a number of short-lived liberal governments led by Papandreou and Nikolaos Plastiras; he was also the Prime Minister of two such governments.\n\nIn 1954 his longtime friendship with Georgios Papandreou was shaken, and he formed the rival Liberal Democratic Union coalition.\n\nThe rift was bridged in 1958, and in 1961 he became a founding member of Papandreou's Center Union party, which he served until his death in 1964.\n\nVenizelos died on the passenger ship \"Hellas\" in the Aegean Sea, en route from Chania to Piraeus. His grave lies next to his father's on the island of Crete. His wife Kathleen died in 1983 aged 86.\n\nVenizelos was a contract bridge player \"of international stature\" during the 1930s, as a voluntary exile in France.

France won the 1935 tournament and a version of the team traveled to New York City late that year for a match against the Four Aces, \"an unofficial world championship match\" that the Aces won.\n\nVenizelos was second in skill to Pierre Albarran among contemporary French players, according to Alan Truscott. Beside the national teams at contract bridge, they both played on a 1933 team that hosted an American foursome led by Ely Culbertson in a long match at \"plafond, the French parent of contract bridge, which differed only in the scoring details.\" The two teams played 102 deals to a draw; Albarran and Venizelos cooperated on a book reporting and analysing the match:\n\nAlbarran, Aron, and Venizelos were three of six players on the 1935 European champion team.\n\n"}

Milutin built the church as his burial place, and it is where he was first laid to rest. However, following the Battle of Kosovo (1389), his body was moved to Trepča and then in 1460 to Sofia (Bulgaria), where it lies to this day.\n\nThe monastery shared the fate of its founder. The monumental building with its church, library, monks' quarters and \"imperial palace\" began to fall into disrepair very early. At the beginning of the 15th century, a fire destroyed the library and in the second half of the same century the monastery was probably abandoned. Benedikt Kuprešić, a traveller, mentioned that the monastery was razed to the ground in the 16th century on the orders of the Ottoman Sultan, as Christians who had fled Ottoman tyranny were gathering in it.\n\nSt Stephen's, almost totally destroyed, was turned into a mosque in the 19th century and served as such until World War I. The first conservation activity was carried out in 1939 and again in 1990, when the church was partly rebuilt. The monastery is one of the few for which the founding charter has been preserved; it was granted a large estate at its founding, of 75 villages and 8 pastures. As the complex was built as the final resting place of a king, the bishopric was \"upgraded\" to a stavropegial monastery - roughly translated, an Imperial monastery, fourth by rank in the state (after Studenica, Mileševa and Sopoćani).\n\nThe building works were led by Archbishop Danilo II, at that time a prior, later Serbian Archbishop, who was a close confidant to the king. According to medieval sources, as well as oral tradition, Banjska was one of the most beautiful Serbian monasteries, built in the Raška architectural style, which was used for all royal mausoleums, from Stefan Nemanja's Studenica monastery to Emperor Dušan's Monastery of the Holy Archangels. The monastery was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990, and is protected by the Republic of Serbia.\n\n\n\n"}

As such they combined unusual and outdated elements, such as saddle tanks and Allan valve gear, with current Great Western details such as the cab, bunker and many minor fittings. G.W.R. 0-6-0T were generally being converted to have Belpaire fireboxes and pannier tanks by this date, but the firebox on the 1361 was round topped, so the saddle tank was more appropriate. The wheelbase allowed them to negotiate radius curves, a feature necessary for their intended duties in docks and on lightly laid branch lines. Although, as is conventional, the design is credited to the C.M.E., Harold Holcroft was the junior draughtsman who did all the actual work on the class.\n\nThe five locomotives were built at Swindon in 1910 and were set to work alongside the ex-Cornwall Minerals Railway locomotives. Their usual home was Plymouth Millbay, Devon, (later Laira shed) from where they worked in Millbay Docks and on the Sutton Harbour branch. Until 1928 some of the locomotives could also be found at St Blazey engine shed, Cornwall, where they worked on ex-Cornwall Minerals Railway branches, and also at Moorswater for working the Looe branch.\n\nIn 1920 one locomotive was transferred to Newton Abbot, Devon, for shunting the railway workshops there, a duty that was to continue until 1952. Other allocations were Taunton (1953–1961) for working at Bridgwater, Somerset, (again, mainly in the town's docks), and Swindon (1956–1961). One was tried briefly on the Weymouth Harbour Tramway in 1949, and another went to St Philips Marsh, Bristol in 1962.\n\nThe same basic design was used for the six 1366 Class locomotives built in 1934, but this time they were fitted with Belpaire fireboxes, pannier tanks and more modern cabs. When the 1361s were withdrawn their remaining duties were given to D2000 diesel shunters. All 5 locomotives served over 50 years of service.\n\nOne member of the 1361 class, No. 1363, was purchased for preservation by a group of members from the Great Western Society in 1964, two years after it was withdrawn from British Railways service at Laira. It was run to Totnes on the South Devon Railway under its own steam, and was restored there. No. 1363 is based at the Didcot Railway Centre, and as of 2014 was dismantled for overhaul to working order.\n\nKernow Model Rail Centre announced plans in 2014 to manufacture an 00 gauge model of the 1361 class in conjunction with DJ Models. The model is being made in partnership with the Great Western Society at Didcot.\nHeljan models announced in 2015 plans to also manufacture a model of this class. Both manufacturers are offering the same livery variants (in some cases on the same locomotive modelled), and similar prices. Heljan's model was released in early 2017 in conjunction with a GWR 1366 class. Kernow's model, produced by DJ Models, was released in March 2018.

After passing through the East India Company College, Strachey entered the Bengal civil service in 1842, and served in the North-Western Provinces, occupying a number of important positions.\n\nIn 1861, Lord Canning appointed him president of a commission to investigate the great cholera epidemic of that year. In 1862 he became judicial commissioner in the Central Provinces. In 1864, after the report of the royal commission on the sanitary condition of the army, a permanent sanitary commission was established in India, with Strachey as president. In 1866, he became Chief Commissioner of Oudh, having been chosen by Lord Lawrence to remedy as far as possible the injustice done after the Indian rebellion of 1857 by the confiscation of the rights of tenants and small proprietors of land, maintaining at the same time the privileges of the Talukdars of great landlords. As member of the legislative council he introduced several bills for that purpose, which, with the full approval of the Talukdars, passed into law.\n\nIn 1868, he became a member of the governor-general's council, and on the assassination of Lord Mayo in 1872 he acted temporarily as viceroy. In 1874 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces. In 1876, by request of Lord Lytton and the secretary of state, he consented to relinquish that office, and returned to the governor-general's council as financial minister, which post he retained until 1880.\n\nDuring this time, while Lord Lytton was viceroy, important reforms were carried out. The measures for decentralizing financial administration, initiated under Lord Mayo, were practically completed. The salt duties were reduced, and the system under which they were levied was altered, and that opprobrium of the administration, the inland customs line, was abolished. The removal of all import duties, including those on English cotton goods, and the establishment of complete free trade, was declared to be the fixed policy of the government, and this was in great measure carried into effect before 1880, when Strachey left India.\n\nThe system under which military accounts were kept occasioned an erroneous estimate of the cost of the Second Afghan War of 1878–80. For this error Strachey was technically responsible; it was made the occasion of a partisan attack, which resulted in his resignation. From 1885 to 1895 Strachey was a member of the council of the secretary of state for India. He died in 1907.\n\nStrachey was joint author with his brother Lt-Gen Sir Richard Strachey of \"The Finances and Public Works of India\" (1882), besides writing \"India\" (3rd ed., 1903), and \"Hastings and the Rohilla War\" (1892).\n\nStrachey married Katherine Batten, daughter of Joseph Batten, Principal of the East India Company College, on 9 October 1856, and they had eight children.

Built in 1721, it was the last of three European forts built in that town to tap the slave trade of the Slave Coast. Following the legal abolition of the slave trade early in the 19th century, the Portuguese fort lay abandoned most of the time until it was permanently reoccupied in 1865.\n\nPortugal succeeded in maintaining its sovereignty over this minuscule enclave until it was seized by the authorities of the new Republic of Dahomey in August 1961.\n\nFollowing the capture of Elmina Castle and their other forts and factories along the Gold Coast by the Dutch in 1637 and the following years, the Portuguese found themselves without any establishments they could call their own on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea, an intolerable situation since, even after peace was restored, the Dutch required Portuguese ship captains wishing to trade in the area that they obtain a permit, and they imposed a levy of 10% on their cargo. Consequently, during the last quarter of the 17th century, the Portuguese Crown and the colonial authorities in Brazil and São Tomé and Príncipe had been discussing building a factory on the Costa da Mina, as the Portuguese called the Slave Coast, to supply slaves to the fast-developing sugar and tobacco plantations around Salvador, Bahia in Brazil.\nIn 1680, a former governor of São Tomé and Príncipe, Julian de Campo Barretto, had bought Christiansborg Castle, close to the Costa da Mina, from the acting head of the Danish fortress but following a mutiny by the garrison and the expulsion of Barretto in 1682, the Portugue sold it back to the Danes.\n\nIn 1680 also, the Prince Regent, the future Pedro II, ordered two ships to build a fortress on the Costa da Mina to \"open up trade for the Portuguese\", but while the name of the two ships along with their captains are found in documents, there is no evidence that anything was built. The debate over the construction of a trading fort resurfaced in 1698 when, having been informed that the King of Hueda on the Costa da Mina wished to have the Portuguese build a fort on his territory, Lisbon asked the viceroy of Brazil to seek the opinion of the Bahia trading interests about the feasibility of building such a fort. However, since the Bahia traders asked to be granted a twelve-year monopoly of the slave trade along with certain other privileges, the plan was abandoned. \n\nIn 1721 the Bahia merchant and shipper interests took advantage of the arrival of a new viceroy, Vasco Fernandes César de Menezes, to force the issue. Their spokesman and instrument was a Captain José Torres who, it was said, knew the Costa da Mina slave trade well and proposed to build a fort at Ajuda (Whydah, Ouidah). As an enticement to immediate action, Torres offered to undertake the work and transport the necessary building materials in his own ship at his own expenses. In 1671 the French had established a small factory there and, with the Hueda king's permission, they replaced it with a fort in 1704. The English Royal African Company followed suit in 1692. The viceroy was aware of these facts and was convinced that it was important \"not to miss this occasion\" and without waiting for the approval of Lisbon, he authorized Torres to go ahead with his plan. Torres set sail for Ouidah in July 1721 and soon after his arrival a fort was erected by slaves of the Hueda king on a site chosen by him a few hundred yards east of the English fort. \n\n\"There are three fortresses here, one French, one English and one Portuguese. They are all built according to the same plan. […] At each angle there is an earthen bastion […] each outfitted with twelve iron cannons. Each fort is surrounded by a moat twenty feet wide with the same depth and in which water is rarely found. There is a bridge at the entrance that can easily be lifted in case of an attack. The French fort is the best maintained one while the Portuguese one is in the worst condition. They all have their gunpowder magazines, which are roofed with thatch, at the center of the courtyard.\"\n\nIn contrast to the imposing and militarily stronger fortresses found elsewhere along the West African coast that were built in solid material and roofed with tiles, the British William's Fort, the French Fort Saint-Louis and the Portuguese Forte São João Baptista, roughly 100 meters square each and lying 300 to 500 meters from each others, had been build in dried mud by African labour using local masonry methods. While the 20-feet deep moats, the thickness of the earthen walls – two to three meters – as well as the cannons atop the bastions did represent a respectable defensive potential, they were not built to sustain serious attacks. The fact that the buildings were roofed with thatch made them particularly vulnerable to fire. Earthen fortifications deteriorated quickly and therefore needed constant reconstruction. In the 18th century, it became almost a ritual for a new director to complain about the sorry state in which he found the installations. Given the building material used, it was easy to add or eliminate buildings or modify the shape of the bastions. Eventually, wood and locally made bricks would be used for door frames and to reinforce bastions and gunpowder magazines. Robin law, the foremost historian of the Slave Coast slave trade referred to the Ouidah forts as \"permanently organized fortified factories\".\n\nThe kings of Hueda, and later Dahomey, did not allow European forts and factories on the seaside. Consequently, the three forts, located about 4 km inland, were particularly vulnerable to \"vexations\" by the kings and their agents and were dependent on their goodwill. A brief submitted to the British Parliament in the early 18th century lamented that \"owning forts drew companies into the expensive complexities of African politics, and required the payment of ground-rents, presents, bribes and loans\", and more so in Ouidah. The Portuguese military engineer José António Caldas who stayed at Ouidah around 1759 wrote that due to their being at some distance from the beach, the three forts were \"subject to the insults of the king of Dahomey\". Each year, the directors of the three forts were required to travel Abomey, 100 km north of Ouidah, to pay their respect to the king during the annual festivities called “customs”. During the troubled years that followed the capture of Ouidah by the king of Dahomey in 1727, all three forts were heavily damaged or destroyed at one time or another, but eventually rebuilt. In 1743, King Tegbesu, suspecting that the director of the Portuguese fort, Joao Basilio, had been conspiring with his enemies, had him imprisoned and expulsed, and the Portuguese fort was destroyed by the explosion of the gunpowder magazine during a subsequent assault by Dahomean troops.. During the second half of the 18th century, there was a gradual drift of the slave trade away from Ouidah to points east such Porto Novo, Badagry and Olim (Lagos) largely due to the arbitrariness of the Dahomean kings and their close control over the trade, which was driving up the price of slaves.\n\nThe legal abolition of the slave trade by Britain, France and Portugal in the early years of the 19th century caused the abandonment or near abandonment of the slave forts. However, starting in the 1830s, British and French trading houses involved in the palm oil export business were allowed to set up their factories in the deserted British and French forts at Ouidah, but the Portuguese fort remained abandoned. Instead, the Brazilian-born Francisco Félix de Sousa, who had started out as a clerk and storekeeper at the fort, later taking charge of the fort, became a major player in the illicit slave trade thanks in a large measure to Portuguese and Brazilian connivance. Having helped a younger brother of the ruling Dahomean king to gain the throne under the name Ghezo, he was installed by him as \"captain of the Whites\". His nickname \"chacha\" (Portuguese: Xàxà) would from then on be assimilated with the post he, and his sons and grandsons after him, held. Enjoying special privileges with regard to the slave trade, now illegal but nevertheless booming, the \"chacha\" , along with three of his sons and other Afro-Brazilian traders, he dominated Brazil's trading network on the Slave Coast. In 1822, he is said to have hoisted the flag of the newly proclaimed Brazilian Empire over the fort, which remained largely unoccupied since he conducted his activities and lived with his wives and many dozens of children in another part of Ouidah.\n\nThe fort was reoccupied by Portugal in 1865. In this period it served as a base for a brief Portuguese attempt to impose a protectorate on the Kingdom of Dahomey of which the city of Hweda (Ajudá – Ouidah) was part (1885–1887).\n\nUntil its annexation by Dahomey in 1961, exactly one year after it had gained independence, São João Baptista de Ajudá was probably the world's smallest recognized political unit: according to the census of 1921 it had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, only 2 inhabitants represented Portuguese Sovereignty. They tried to burn it rather than surrendering.\n\nDahomey's annexation of the fort was formally recognized by Portugal in 1975.\n\nThe fort is a small square with towers at its four corners. It comprises a church and officers' quarters. The fort houses a museum.\n\nBruce Chatwin’s book \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\" (1980) is a fictional retelling of the life of \"Francisco Félix de Sousa\", the Sousa family founder in Benin and that of his powerful local descendants, dealing also with the subject of slave trade with Brazil.\n\n"}

He studied at the University of Halle in Germany, and eventually became a professor at the University of Aberdeen. He is best known for his commentary on the Revelation of St. John. He also wrote two other well-known books that are classics: \"The Resurrection of our Lord\" and \"The Ascension of our Lord\".\n\nHe was born at Edinburgh on 15 March 1821, the eldest of seven children of the Rev. George Milligan and his wife, Janet Fraser.\nHis father, a licentiate of the Church of Scotland, was then engaged in teaching at Edinburgh, and from 1825 lived at 1 Rankeillor Street, in the South Side. Milligan was sent to the High School, where he was dux of his class.\n\nIn 1832, when his father became minister of the Fifeshire parish of Elie, he was transferred to the neighbouring parish school of Kilconquhar, and thence proceeded in 1835 to the university of St. Andrews.\nThough only fourteen years of age, he earned from that day, by private teaching, as much as paid his class-fees, much to his parents' relief, for Elie was a 'small living.'\nGraduating M.A. in 1839, and devoting himself to the ministry, he took his divinity course partly at St. Andrews and partly at Edinburgh, and for a time he was tutor to the sons of Sir George Suttie of Prestongrange. \n\nDuring the disruption controversy of 1843, Milligan adhered to the church of Scotland.\nHe wrote to his father that he was resolved to \"remain in ... and lend any aid he could to those who are ready to unite in building up, on principles agreeable to the word of God, the old church of Scotland.\"\nHe was at this time assistant to Robert Swan, minister at Abercrombie ; next year he was presented to the Fifeshire parish of Cameron and ordained.\n\nIn 1845, his health gave cause for anxiety, and he obtained a leave of absence for a year, which he spent in Germany, studying at Halle. He made the acquaintance, among others, of August Neander, in whom he found a kindred spirit.\nPromoted in 1850 to the more important parish of Kilconquhar, and in 1860 he was appointed first professor of biblical criticism in the university of Aberdeen. He worked hard ; but his liberal politics and mild broad-church views were not congenial to many of his colleagues, and his amiability concealed from his students the real strength of his character. Nevertheless, his power and influence grew, and in 1870 he joined the company formed for the revision of the English New Testament. From that time onward he was a prolific writer. His style, prolix at first, became pure and graceful, and in such works as those on the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ and on the Revelation of St. John he took a foremost place among British theologians. In the church courts, too, his rise was steady. In 1872 he was sent, together with the Rev. J. Marshall Lang (now Principal Lang) as a representative from the general assembly of the church of Scotland to the assembly of the presbyterian church in the United States ; in 1875 he was elected depute-clerk of the general assembly ; and in 1886 he succeeded Principal John Tulloch as principal clerk.\n\nAlready in 1882, partly in recognition of his work as a New Testament reviser, he had been elevated to the moderator's chair. His address on the occasion was notable for its declaration that, in any scheme for church reunion in Scotland, the Scottish episcopalians must be considered ; while its enunciation of doctrine concerning the church called forth the warm approval of Canon Liddon, who wrote and thanked him for it.\nAlthough in his earlier days his humanitarian feelings, and his enthusiasm for liberty and progress, had allied him with those who were then called broad churchmen, Milligan did not have at any period of his career the slightest sympathy with the disregard for doctrine which has sometimes marked the members of that school.\n\nUltimately he ranged himself with high churchmen, being, he declared, impelled to join them by increased study of the New Testament.\nHis doctrine of the church he gathered for himself from the Epistle to the Ephesians, on which he had contributed an important article to the ninth edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica.\" His views on the importance of dogma and on the sacraments he learned, as he believed, from St. John, of whose writings he was a lifelong student and diligent expositor.\n\nThis development of his opinions in no way limited his width of sympathy, nor did it interfere with the friendly intercourse, ecclesiastical as well as social, that he had been wont to hold with nonconformists with Wesleyans like Dr. W. F. Moulton, or with independents like Principal Fairbairn. He had been a member for years of the Church Service Society.\n\nIn 1892, when the Scottish Church Society was constituted 'to defend and advance catholic doctrine as set forth in the ancient creeds, and embodied in the standards of the church of Scotland, &c.,' he took an important part in its formation, and accepted office as its first president. The last letter he wrote from his death-bed was to the first conference of this society, then being held in Glasgow. A few days previously he had said that the greatest need of the church of Scotland was the restoration of a weekly celebration of the eucharist.\n\nMilligan was keenly interested in social and especially in educational questions. In 1888 he went to Germany to inquire about technical education and continuation schools in that country; and the next year he visited Sweden to see the working of the Gottenburg licensing system. In Aberdeen, he was an active philanthropist; and all over Scotland his services as a preacher were in much request.\n\nWhen on the eve of retiring from his chair at Aberdeen owing mainly to failing eyesight, Milligan was suddenly seized with illness which soon proved fatal. He died at Edinburgh on 11 December 1893. He is buried in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh. The grave lies just west of the central vaults close to the grave of Jessie Gellatly.\n\nMilligan's literary productiveness began in 1855, when he contributed the first of a series of papers to Kitto's \"Journal of Sacred Literature.\"\nIn 1857, he addressed a 'Letter to the Duke of Argyll on the Education Question.' \"The Decalogue and the Lord's Day\" (1866) was evoked by the controversy stirred in Scotland by a speech of Dr. Norman MacLeod's, as his \"Words of the New Testament\" (1873) — written in conjunction with Dr. Roberts — belonged to the literature of New Testament revision. \n\nIn 1878, appeared a volume on the \"Higher Education of Women;\" and the next year he contributed to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" his important article on the \"Epistle to the Ephesians.\" \"The Resurrection of our Lord\" and his \"Commentary on St. John\" (in conjunction with Dr. Moulton) (1882), his \"Commentary on the Revelation\" (1883), his \"Discussions on the Apocalypse\" (1883), his \"Baird Lectures on the Revelation of St. John\" (1886), \"Elijah\" (1887), \"The Resurrection of the Dead\" (1890), \"The Ascension and Heavenly Priesthood of our Lord,\" and his presidential address on the \"Aims of the Scottish Church Society\" (1892), were all productions of his ripened powers. Besides these he contributed many articles to periodicals.\nHis last article was a notice \"In Memoriam\" of Dr. Hort, which appeared in the \"Expository Times\" (1893).\n\nIn 1859 he married Annie Mary Moir, the daughter of David Macbeth Moir. They had several children. His daughter Agnes Milligan married Godfrey Carey. His son Oswald Milligan became a church historian.\n\nHe left unfinished a work on the Epistle to the Hebrews, and forbade the publication of the parts he had written; some of his notes, however, have been used in a work on the same subject, since published by his eldest son, the Rev. George Milligan who went on to be Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1923.\n\n\n"}

He and his Canadian wife moved to Afghanistan in July 2001. They were separated when trying to leave in November 2001 and Zemiri was arrested and turned over to United States forces. He was transferred to the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2002, where he was detained for eight years without charge.\n\nAhmed Ressam, the terrorist convicted in 2001 of planning the foiled Millennium bombing of the Los Angeles Airport, alleged that Zemiri had been involved in the plot. In late 2006, he recanted his accusation entirely. In January 2010, Zemiri was freed from Guantanamo Bay and repatriated to Algeria.\n\nAhcene Zemiri was born in Algeria, where he was raised as a Muslim. As a young man he emigrated to Canada.\n\nHe settled in Montreal in 1994 and became a legal resident. He married Karina Dereshteanu, a Canadian woman, in 1997.\n\nIn about June 2001, the couple moved to Afghanistan. As fighting increased, in November, they decided to leave because Karina was pregnant. They decided to separate, as they had heard that women and children were being permitted to enter Pakistan safely. They did not see each other again until 2010, years after their son Karim was born. Karina Zemiri believes that bounty hunters picked up her husband and sold him to the Americans, as was commonly done.\n\nZemiri was transferred by the Americans to Guantanamo in 2002. Ahmed Ressam, who had been convicted in 2001 of planning the Millennium bombing of the Los Angeles Airport, alleged that Zemiri was involved in the plot.\n\nIn 2004, Zemiri was interrogated at Guantanamo by officials of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), after the Canadian government had been informed of his detention. They also interviewed Djamel Ameziane, an Algerian, and Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a Mauritanian, who also were Canadian residents before being captured in Afghanistan and sent to Guantanamo.\n\nWhile some detainees had reported seeing Canadian officials, the government originally denied it. These accounts were not confirmed until July 2008, after the Canadian Supreme Court ordered the release of certain materials related to the case of the Canadian citizen Omar Khadr, then still a detainee at Guantanamo. The Canadian government was reviewing the role of its CSIS agents, as it was concerned they may have colluded with the US during interrogation under torture. In addition, the US Supreme Court had held that the government was illegally detaining persons at Guantanamo in the period when the CSIS agents had interviewed residents there.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, Michelle Shephard, writing in the \"Toronto Star\", reported that Canadian security officials had interviewed Zemiri and two others at Guantanamo in addition to Khadr.\n\nIn \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\" (2004), the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees had the right to review of their cases before an impartial tribunal to determine if they were enemy combatants. The Center for Constitutional Rights organized a program of finding United States lawyers who would agree to serve as the lawyers for Guantanamo captives, while serving writs of habeas corpus on their behalf in federal district court to challenge their detention.\n\nLawyers from the firm Fredrikson & Byron of Minneapolis agreed to serve \"pro bono\" to represent Ahcene Zemiri and met with him in 2005. In the petition for \"habeas corpus,\" they asserted that their client had not been a member of the Taliban, al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups; \"had no military or terrorist training, and has neither caused nor tried to harm American personnel or property.\"\n\nTo respond to the Court, the Bush administration established Combatant Status Review Tribunals, and from the fall of 2004 through 2005, conducted reviews of detainee cases. In part because of the allegations by Ressam that Zemiri was involved in the LAX plot, although he denied it, the U.S. designated Zemiri as an unlawful enemy combatant and recommended his continued detention.\n\nDetainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \"enemy combatants\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention.\n\nIn January 2007, the press reported that Ahmed Ressam, who had been convicted in 2001 of planning the Millennium bombing and alleged that Zemiri was involved in the plot, wrote a letter in November 2006 to the U.S. District Court Judge John C. Coughenour. He said he wanted to \"clarify\" his allegations against Zemiri and recanted his previous accusations. Coughenour was the Judge who sentenced Ressam.\n\nRessam wrote:\n\nRessam explained he had offered false information because he \"was in shock and had a severe psychological disorder.\" Ressam was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment. Reporters suggested at the time of his trial that he was at risk for a life sentence, which was reduced because he cooperated by naming other suspects, such as Zemiri.\n\nAccording to Jim Dorsey, Zemiri's lawyer, \"This letter undercuts what is the most damning allegation against my client by far.\" Dorsey forwarded a copy of Ressam's letter to American military officials at Guantanamo.\n\nIn preparing their \"habeas corpus\" cases, the attorneys for Ahcene Zemiri and Mohammedou Slahi, a Mauritanian national who also lived in Canada, appealed through the Canadian Justice system for the release of classified documents about the two men. They were trying to gain access to information gathered by Canada. Both men had been interviewed by Canadian security officials before they went to Afghanistan. The men's lawyers argued that the notes from the men's Canadian interviews would have been used by the United States in building its dossiers against the two men. They had requested the Canadian evidence in order to make their case for the men's freedom in the US Justice system.\n\nIn 2009, Justice Edmond Blanchard ruled that since the men were not Canadian citizens, and their connection to Canada was \"tenuous\", the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms did not apply to them. In a different case, the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled that the Canadian government should publish classified documents which the United States had shared about the Canadian citizen Omar Khadr.\n\nNathan Whitling, one of the men's Canadian lawyers, predicted that the men's American \"habeas corpus\" cases in the United States would be heard before the appeal he planned of Blanchard's ruling could get through the court.\n\nAhcene Zemiri and Adil Hadi al Jazairi Bin Hamlili were returned to Algeria on January 20, 2010, as their country of origin and citizenship. Carol Rosenberg, writing in the \"Miami Herald\", reported that it was not clear whether the two men had been sent home as free men, or whether they were transferred to Algerian security custody. She noted that two other Algerians, former detainees, had been granted asylum in France, because they had reason to fear a return home.\n\n"}

{"id": "2220692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220692", "title": "Wick effect", "text": "Wick effect\n\nThe wick effect is the name given to the partial destruction of a human body by fire, when the clothing of the victim soaks up melted human fat and acts like the wick of a candle. The wick effect is a phenomenon that is found to occur under certain conditions, and has been thoroughly observed. It is one commonly offered explanation for the alleged phenomenon of spontaneous human combustion (SHC).\n\nThe wick effect theory says a person is kept aflame through his/her own fats after being ignited, accidentally or otherwise. The clothed human body acts like an \"inside-out\" candle, with the fuel source (human fat) inside and the wick (the clothing of the victim) outside. Hence there is a continuous supply of fuel in the form of melting fat seeping into the victim's clothing. Fat contains a large amount of energy due to the presence of long hydrocarbon chains.\n\nMary Reeser (1884–1951) of St. Petersburg, Florida was most likely a victim of the wick effect. It was suspected that she'd accidentally ignited herself with a cigarette. The fat which over time had been absorbed by her clothing likely acted as fuel for the fire. At the scene, investigators found melted fat in the rug near Mary's body.\n\nAn investigation of a 1963 case in Leeds included an experiment with a wick effect. A small portion of human fat was wrapped in cloth to simulate clothing. A Bunsen burner flame was then applied to the 'candle'. Due to the high water content of human fat the flame had to be held on the 'candle' for over a minute before it would catch fire:\n\"One end of the candle was ignited by a Bunsen flame, the fat catching fire after about a minute. Although the Bunsen was removed at this point, combustion of the fat proceeded slowly along the length of the roll, with a smoky yellow flame and much production of soot, the entire roll being consumed after about one hour.\"\nThis gives some indication of the slow speed with which the wick effect will proceed.\n\nIn February 1991, in woodland near Medford, Oregon, USA, two hikers came across the burning body of a female adult, lying face down in fallen leaves. They alerted the officials and a local deputy sheriff soon arrived. The victim was described as \"well nourished\". She had been stabbed several times in the upper regions of the chest and back. Both arms were spread outwards from the torso. The lower legs and surface of the neck showed signs of fire damage. The soft tissues of the right arm, torso and upper legs were consumed. The majority of bones of these parts retained their integrity, although friability was increased. Between mid-chest and knees the fleshy parts of the body were mostly destroyed. Crime scene personnel reported that the pelvis and spine were \"not recoverable\", having been reduced to a grey powder. Her killer had soaked the clothes and corpse in nearly a pint of barbecue starter fluid and set her on fire. In the well-oxygenated outdoor environment, this combination of circumstances—an immobile and clothed body with a high fat-to-muscle ratio, accelerant (lighter fluid), and artificial ignition—made it prime for the wick effect to occur. The murderer was arrested and made a full confession. He claimed to have set the body alight some thirteen hours before it was discovered.\n\nA larger scale experiment conducted for the BBC television programme \"Q.E.D.\" involved a dead pig's body being wrapped in a blanket and placed in a furnished room. The blanket was lit with the aid of a small amount of petrol. The body took some time to ignite and burned at a very high temperature with low flames. The heat collected at the top of the room and melted a television. However, the flames caused very little damage to the surroundings, and the body burned for a number of hours before it was extinguished and examined. On examination it was observed that the flesh and bones in the burnt portion had been destroyed.\n\nIn October 2006, the body of a man was discovered at home in Geneva, almost completely incinerated between the mid-chest and the knees, most probably due to heart attack while smoking, followed by the wick effect. The chair containing the body was mostly consumed, but other objects in the room were almost undamaged, albeit covered with a brown oily or greasy coating. The source of the fire was most likely a cigarette or cigar. The man's dog also died in another room of the man's apartment; this was attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIn December 2010, the cremated body of a man was found in his home in Clareview Park at Ballybane in the Irish city of Galway (Parris-Long, 2011). The fire investigators concluded that no accelerants were used and that the open fireplace was not the cause of the fire. The coroner in the case could not identify the cause of the death due to extensive internal organ damage and concluded that \"this [case] fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation\".\n"}
{"id": "2220694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220694", "title": "Can't Stop the Music", "text": "Can't Stop the Music\n\nCan't Stop the Music is a 1980 American musical comedy film directed by Nancy Walker. Written by Allan Carr and Bronté Woodard, the film is a pseudo-biography of disco's Village People that bears only a vague resemblance to the actual story of the group's formation. It was produced by Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment (formerly EMI Films), and distributed by independent distributor Associated Film Distribution (AFD). The film was released after disco's peak and was subsequently a box office flop, winning two of the first ever Razzie Awards for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay.\n\nSongwriter Jack Morell—a reference to Village People creator Jacques Morali—gets a break DJing at local disco Saddle Tramps. His roommate, Samantha \"Sam\" Simpson, is a supermodel newly retired at the peak of her success. She sees the response to a song that he wrote for her (\"Samantha\") and agrees to use her connections to get him a record deal. Her connection is her ex-boyfriend Steve Waits, president of Marrakech Records—a reference to Village People record label Casablanca Records—who is more interested in rekindling their romantic relationship than in Jack's music (and more interested in taking business calls than in wooing Samantha), but agrees to listen to a demo.\n\nSam decides that Jack's vocals are not adequate, so she recruits neighbor and Saddle Tramps waiter/go-go boy Felipe Rose (the Indian), fellow model David \"Scar\" Hodo (the construction worker, who daydreams of stardom in the solo number \"I Love You to Death\"), and finds Randy Jones (the cowboy) on the streets of Greenwich Village, offering dinner in return for their participation. Meanwhile, Sam's former agent, Sydney Channing, orders Girl Friday Lulu Brecht to attend, hoping to lure back the star. Ron White, a lawyer from St. Louis, is mugged by an elderly woman on his way to deliver a cake that Sam's sister sent and arrives disconcerted. Brecht gives Jack drugs, which unnerves him when her friend Alicia Edwards brings singing cop Ray Simpson (the policeman), but Jack records the quartet on \"Magic Night\". Ron, pawed all night by the man-hungry Brecht, is overwhelmed by the culture shock of it all and leaves.\n\nThe next day, Sam runs into Ron, who apologizes, proffers the excuse that he is a Gemini and follows her home. Spilling leftover lasagna on himself, Sam and Jack help him remove his trousers before Jack leaves and Sam and Ron spend the night. Newly interested in helping, Ron offers his Wall Street office to hold auditions. There, Glenn M. Hughes (the leatherman), climbs atop a piano for a rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and he and Alex Briley (the G.I.) join the group, now a sextet. They get their name from an offhand remark by Ron's socialite mother Norma. Ron's boss, Richard Montgomery, overwhelmed by the carnival atmosphere, insists that the firm not represent the group, and Ron quits.\n\nRon's new idea for rehearsal space is the YMCA (the ensuing production number \"YMCA\" features its athletic denizens in various states of undress; the film is one of the few non-R-rated offerings to feature full-frontal male nudity). The group cuts a demo (\"\"Liberation\"\") for Marrakech, but Steve sees limited appeal and Sam refuses his paltry contract. Reluctant to use her savings, they decide to self-finance by throwing a pay-party.\n\nTo bankroll the party, Sam acquiesces to Channing's plea to return for a TV advertising campaign for milk, on the condition that the Village People are featured. The lavish number \"Milkshake\" begins as Sam pours milk for six little boys in the archetypal costumes with the promise that they will grow up to be the Village People. The advertisers want nothing to do with such a concept, and refuse to broadcast the spot. Norma then steps in to invite the group to debut at her charity fundraiser in San Francisco. Sam lures Steve by promising a romantic weekend, but Ron is taken aback by the inference that she would go through with the seduction, and Sam ends their romantic relationship. On his private jet, Steve prepares for a tryst, but rather Jack and his former chorine mother Helen arrive to negotiate a contract. Initially reluctant, Helen wins over Steve with her kreplach, and before long they are negotiating the T-shirt merchandising for the Japanese market.\n\nIn the dressing room before the show, Ron, relieved to learn that Sam did not travel with Steve, proposes to her. At one point, Montgomery appears, seeking to rehire Ron as a junior partner representing the group. Following a set by The Ritchie Family (\"Give Me a Break\"), the Village People make a triumphant debut (\"Can't Stop the Music\").\n\nOriginally titled \"Discoland... Where the Music Never Ends\", \"Can't Stop the Music\" was a fictionalised account of the formation of the Village People. Allan Carr announced the film in June 1979, describing it as \"\"Singing in the Rain\" for the disco crowd\" and stating that the film would star the Village People, Valerie Perrine, Tammy Grimes, Chita Rivera, Barbara Rush, Pat Ast and Bruce Jenner. It was to be the first in a three picture slate from Carr, the others including \"Chicago\" and \"The Josephine Baker Story\" starring Diana Ross. Filming was to start on August 20 of that year and was financed by British company EMI, then under the aegis of Barry Spikings. When asked why EMI were making a film about disco so long after \"Saturday Night Fever\", Spikings said, \"I hope it is different. The film breaks new ground.\"\n\nThe film's director, Nancy Walker, a theater, film, and television star since the 1940s, had been nominated for two Tonys, four Golden Globes, and eight Emmys. Walker had guest starred as Rhoda's mother Ida Morgenstern in several episodes of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and continued that role in its spin-off \"Rhoda\". After establishing the character, Walker directed some episodes of both series, along with episodes of other situation comedy series. \"Can't Stop the Music\" was her lone effort at film direction, as after it, Walker turned her attention back to acting in television.\n\nThe film's supporting cast includes two two-time Tony Award winners, Tammy Grimes and Russell Nype, June Havoc (sister of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee), Altovise Davis (wife of Sammy Davis, Jr.), character actor Jack Weston, and Emmy-winner Leigh Taylor-Young. Chita Rivera and Pat Ast were initially cast but dropped out of the film's production.\n\n\"Can't Stop the Music\" was Bruce Jenner's film debut after becoming famous for three world record-setting performances in the Decathlon, and a Gold medal win at the 1976 Olympic Games. Jenner's record stood from 1975 until shortly before this film's 1980 release. Jenner did not appear in another film until Adam Sandler's \"Jack and Jill\" (2011), which, like \"Can't Stop the Music\", won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture. Carr said, \"Jenner is going to be the Robert Redford of the 80s, and this film will do for Valerie what \"Carnal Knowledge\" did for Ann-Margret.\"\n\nThe Village People auditionees depicted in the film included Blackie Lawless (a member of the glam-punk group New York Dolls and heavy metal group W.A.S.P.) and James Marcel (who would later find greater success with the name James Wilder). Background dancers included Perri Lister, girlfriend of Billy Idol and mother to his son, and Peter Tramm, who would go on to appear in dozens of music videos and double for Kevin Bacon in \"Footloose\".\n\nRay Simpson's role was originally intended for Victor Willis, the original lead singer of the Village People who quit the group during pre-production of this film. Wanting to assert his heterosexuality amongst the gay-themed group, Willis had insisted his then-wife, Phylicia Ayers-Allen, be written into the film as his girlfriend. When he quit the group, Ayers-Allen was fired and replaced by Altovise Davis.\n\n\"This movie's a revolution,\" said Carr. \"I mean this movie is launching whole new careers and we need new stars today. Warren and Ryan and Redford - these people are way over 40.\"\n\nCarr had attempted to cast \"Grease\" star Olivia Newton-John in this film as Samantha, but after discussions between her producer, John Farrar, and Morali over who would write Newton-John's numbers, Newton-John instead signed on to play the lead in \"Xanadu\". \"It wasn't only money,\" said Carr, \"it was creative control and other demands.\"\n\nThe schedule of the film was 11 weeks: eight in Los Angeles, two in New York and one in San Francisco. A proposed week of filming on Fire Island was scrapped due to fear of the weather. Producer Allan Carr was coming off a massive worldwide hit with the pop musical \"Grease\" when shooting took place between May and July 1979 at the height of the disco craze. Carr took a hands-on role with the production, and personally directed and cast the male athlete extras for the \"YMCA\" musical sequence.\n\nShooting took place at MGM Studios in Culver City, California, with location shooting in New York City and San Francisco. Location shooting in New York was somewhat complicated by adjacent protests by gay activists over the William Friedkin film \"Cruising\" (starring Al Pacino), which was filming on location nearby. The two productions were mistaken for each other more than once, with protestors disrupting the \"Can't Stop the Music\" location shoots when they had intended to halt production of \"Cruising\". A few weeks prior to release, Jenner and Perrine hosted a TV special, \"Allan Carr's Magic Night\", to promote the film.\n\nTensions between Walker and Valerie Perrine rose on the set to the point that Walker would not be present for scenes featuring Perrine, leaving director of cinematography Bill Butler to direct in her place. Additionally, Perrine was reportedly unhappy that a dance number in which she danced was cut from the film.\n\nCarr said he decided to change the title during filming because, as the music score included older ballads and Broadway numbers, it would be inaccurate to call it \"Discoland\". During filming, sales for the Village People albums started to decline and disco became increasingly unfashionable. \"They'll still be hot,\" said Carr of the Village People. \"If not I will resurrect them.\" Two of the band's three biggest hits, \"In the Navy\" and \"Macho Man,\" do not appear in the film, though Perrine wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \"Macho Woman\" as she jogs through the men's locker room at the YMCA. Another reference to one of the band's songs, \"San Francisco (You've Got Me),\" appears in the opening credits, as Jack passes a group of three women with the words \"San Francisco\" printed on their T-shirts.\n\nThe band's silver and white costumes in the \"Milkshake\" sequence and red costumes in the finale sequences were designed by Tony- and Oscar-winning designer Theoni V. Aldredge.\n\n\nJack's song \"Samantha\" is credited in the film as being sung by David London, a pseudonym for rock singer Dennis \"Fergie\" Frederiksen, who was the lead singer for several popular rock bands during the 1980s. London/Frederiksen also sings a second song on the soundtrack, \"The Sound of the City\".\n\nWhile the film's soundtrack album contains the 10 songs from the film, the incidental score by Morali and Belolo was released on LP only in Australia. One of the songs in the film's background score is the instrumental backing track of \"Like an Eagle,\" a hit song by another Casablanca Records artist, Dennis Parker.\n\nBy the time of the film's release during the summer of 1980, the disco genre had not only peaked in the United States but also was experiencing a backlash there. As a result, the film received scathing reviews from critics and performed poorly at the box office. At a cost estimated at $20 million, the film was a colossal failure financially, bringing in only a tenth of that in gross revenue, and is considered one of the reasons for the downfall of AFD. \"Our timing was wrong, and in this business, timing is everything,\" wrote Lew Grade, who invested in the movie. The soundtrack album was better received, and while it reached only #49 in the U.S. (the first Village People album not to go Gold), it reached #9 in the UK and #1 in Australia. The film itself also performed well in Australia, where the world premiere preview was shown at the Paramount Theatre, Sydney on June 1, 1980, with the after party held at Maxy's. The BBC bought the film for two showings for $3.5 million, which caused much controversy at the time, while ABC in America paid $6 million.\n\nCarr's next film, \"Grease 2\", brought in more than twice as much on its opening weekend as this film grossed in its entire run. Even though it was considered a failure, \"Grease 2\" nearly made back its investment in its U.S. gross alone.\n\nSince its initial failure, the film has gained something of a cult status as a camp film. Released on DVD in 2002, the film has been screened at gay film festivals, including the 2008 London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, and is an annual New Year's tradition on Australian television.\n\nBaskin-Robbins Ice Cream sold a flavor called \"Can't Stop the Nuts\" as part of the promotion of the film.\n\n\"Can't Stop the Music\" has received very negative reviews from critics. It currently holds an 7% \"rotten\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 2.41/10. \"The New York Times\" gave the film a scathing review, calling it \"thoroughly homogenized.\" \"Variety\" magazine felt likewise, writing \"The Village People, along with ex-Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, have a long way to go in the acting stakes.\" Nell Minow of \"Yahoo! Movies\" called the film \"an absolute trainwreck of a movie\", but that it had \"some hilariously campy moments.\" Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert selected the film as one of their \"dogs of the year\" in a 1980 episode of \"Sneak Previews\".\n\n\"Can't Stop the Music\" was the first winner of the Worst Picture Golden Raspberry Award, for it was a double feature of this and \"Xanadu\" that inspired John J. B. Wilson to start the Razzies. The film is listed in Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of \"The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made\".\n\n\n\"Can't Stop the Music\" was released on Warner Home Video Region 1 DVD on April 16, 2002. Shout Factory released a Blu-ray edition on June 11, 2019.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2220713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220713", "title": "Themyscira (DC Comics)", "text": "Themyscira (DC Comics)\n\nThemyscira () is a fictional unitary sovereign city-state and archipelagic island nation appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Previously known as Paradise Island and the Amazon Isles, it first appeared in \"All Star Comics\" #8 (December 1941).\n\nRegarded as a utopia, it is governed by \"Aphrodite's Law\", which declared that the Amazons would be immortal as long as no man set foot on their island.\n\nThemyscira is the theocracy and capital city that serves as the Amazonians' government and place of origin for Wonder Woman. The name for the entire archipelago became \"The Paradise Islands\", when the city was renamed \"Themyscira\" with the character's February 1987 relaunch in \"Wonder Woman\" (vol. 2) #1. Both the island and city are named after the mythological city of Themiscyra, the capital of the Amazons in Greek mythology.\n\nWhen Wonder Woman's homeland is first introduced in 1941, it is referred to as Paradise Island, a secret and hidden island on Earth inhabited by the Amazons of myth. The Amazons were given a break from the hostilities and temptations of Man's World, and so were decreed to start a new life improving themselves by sequestering themselves to this island away from ancient Greece, after being enslaved by Hercules. With the island blessed by the Olympian Gods, no man was allowed to physically set foot on it. When United States Army intelligence officer Steve Trevor's plane crashes there during World War II, he is nursed back to health just outside of the capital city by Princess Diana, daughter of the island's Queen Hippolyta. Diana later competes against other Amazons to become Wonder Woman, the emissary from Paradise Island who will accompany Steve back to \"Man's World\" and aid in the fight against the Axis powers. It was established that all Amazons are adept at a discipline called \"bullets and bracelets\" in which they are able to deflect bullets fired at them using the chain bands on their wrists.\n\nIt was originally implied, but not yet fully confirmed, that Paradise Island was located somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Then in the 1970s television incarnation (as portrayed by Lynda Carter), Paradise Island's location was set in the Bermuda Triangle. And the 2009 animated movie version had set it in the Aegean Sea.\n\nOriginally, there were three generations of Amazons living on the island, with Princess Diana being from the second.\n\nThis basic back-story remains intact throughout the Golden Age and Silver Age of Comic Books, until the 1985–1986 \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" storyline. Upon the conclusion of this limited series, most characters in the DC Comics universe underwent some revamp or retcon in their storyline history, and Wonder Woman was one of several characters whose entire continuity was rebooted.\n\nThe 1987 relaunch of the \"Wonder Woman\" series establishes that the Amazons are the reincarnated souls of women slain throughout pre-history by men. Shaped from clay over 3,000 years previous and given new lives by five Olympian goddesses — Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Hestia, and Aphrodite — the Amazons are granted immortality, great physical strength, highly acute senses, beauty, wisdom, and love for one another. They are tasked to teach the merits of virtue, love, and equality to the men of \"Patriarch’s World\". They have founded the city-state of Themyscira in ancient Greece – Modern day Turkey, which is ruled by sisters Hippolyta and Antiope. Ares, the God of War and a chief opponent of the Amazons, manipulates his half brother Heracles to gather forces and attack Themyscira. Heracles subdues and ravages Hippolyta, and his forces succeed in ransacking Themyscira and making the Amazons their slaves. Hippolyta pleads with the goddesses for help. Athena agrees to aid the Amazons, but only if they do not go against their purpose of creation by seeking revenge. When they agree to her terms, Athena frees the Amazons from their chains. Once freed, however, the Amazons proceed to slaughter most of their captors. Antiope leads a force of Amazons off into Greece, seeking vengeance on Heracles. As decreed by the goddesses, Hippolyta leads the remaining Amazons to a remote island where, as penance for their failures as teachers, they become guardians of Doom's Doorway, preventing the escape of the monsters beneath. Renaming the island paradise Themyscira after their fallen capital, the Amazons began their new lives, erecting buildings and monuments and perfecting their skills as artisans and warriors.\n\nFor centuries, the Amazons of Themyscira live in a perfect state of harmony with their surroundings, under a theocracy. They know no racism, although many consider Antiope's Lost Tribe of Amazons as little more than savages. They do not think in terms of male gender; the word \"policeman\" is alien to them until Diana's departure into the outside world. Homosexuality is completely natural to them — while some Amazons are chaste, others have loving consorts. Their city is composed entirely of Greco-Roman architecture from 1200 BCE, and they wear Greek garb, togas, sandals, and period armor. The Amazons also all wear the Bracelets of Submission as constant reminders of their Enslavement and obedience to their patrons, although only Diana is able to deflect bullets with them. They are fervently religious, worshipping their gods as living deities. Artemis is their primary goddess, and they worship her with a sacrifice of a deer. The Amazons celebrate their creation each year in a Feast of Five, remembering the goddesses who brought them to life.\n\nOccasionally, the Nereides bring to the shores of Themyscira young infants who would have otherwise drowned in accidents. Called \"sending forth\", these infants are tutored spiritually in Amazonian ideals, and they are then sent back mystically to the place of their disappearance. Julia Kapatelis, Diana's first friend in Patriarch's World, is one such infant.\n\nThemyscira is presently located in the Bermuda Triangle, but possesses the magical ability to teleport to any location or time period its inhabitants desire.\n\n\nIn recent times, Hippolyta's daughter Diana, also known as Wonder Woman, has become an ambassador to the outside world. With Diana's help, the Amazons have opened the shores of Themyscira to dignitaries of \"Patriarch’s World\". The creatures beneath Doom's Doorway were defeated, and for a time the Amazons destroyed their battle armor as testament to a new period of peace. The Amazons opened up their shores to dignitaries from Patriarch's world, female and male, but that exchange was almost destroyed by Eris, Goddess of Discord. The Amazons even conducted their own tour of the United States, where they were framed for the murders of several people by Antiope's descendants, the mercenary assassins of Bana-Mighdall, and Circe. It was during the War of the Gods that the Amazons recrafted their armory, vowing to again become warriors. Circe would transplant many of these mercenary women of Bana-Migdhall, called the \"Lost Tribe\", to Themyscira, where, after warring with the Amazons already there, joined forces to stop Circe herself. The two sects of Amazons forged an uneasy truce, living at opposite ends of the island.\n\nProfessor Julia Kapatelis, close friend to Wonder Woman and the Amazons, was later presented with a grant by the National Geographic Society to locate the original Turkish city of Themyscira. Unfortunately Julia had to leave the excavation midway through the project once one of her daughter's friends committed suicide. Whether the original city of Themyscira has been fully excavated or not has not been shown.\n\nLater still, Darkseid’s forces ravaged Themyscira during a search to locate the Greek gods, killing nearly half of the Amazons there in the process. As they began rebuilding, the Amazons found themselves reverting to stone. This was as a result of the gods’ departure from the mortal plane, and the Amazons’ connection to their creator beings so diminished as to revert their bodies to their primordial state. With the gods returned to Olympus, the Amazons were again transformed into their flesh and blood state. Yet more Amazons were killed in a confrontation with the demonic entity known as Neron.\n\nWith Diana and Hippolyta adventuring in Patriarch's World as Wonder Woman for longer and longer periods of time, the Banas and the Themyscirans were manipulated into a bloody civil war at the hands of Magala, who had been possessed by the spirit of Antiope's murderer, Ariadne. Using the pre-existing disdain of the tribes against each other, Magala used allies among both Amazon cities to spark the vengeful conflict. The island was left in ruins, and the war was only stopped when Hippolyta abolished the royal family, renounced her throne.\n\nLeft at odds but on even political ground, the Bana Amazons and the Themyscirans joined forces against the alien forces of Imperiex. Themyscira, mystically moved into outer space, was destroyed, and hundreds of Amazons from both tribes died. When Wonder Woman led each tribe of Amazons into an ecumenical prayer, funneling power into the new god Darkseid, the warrior women helped destroy Imperiex and its ally Brainiac 13.\n\nAfter the island had been destroyed by Imperiex during the \"Our Worlds at War\" storyline, Themyscira was rebuilt and relocated, this time to the Bermuda Triangle. Designed by the likes of Julia Kapatelis, the Martian Manhunter, Steve Trevor, Canadian architect Jean Claude Tibet, and Amazon master designer Kaleeza Fashed, the new Themyscira was built with the help of alien technology. Adding to the re-creation of the islands, Themyscira was restored by the combined might of the Greek and Egyptian goddesses the Amazons worship. Transformed into a mighty series of floating islands dedicated to the free exchange of information and ideas, the new Themyscira was governed by members of both tribes of Amazons. After some time Themyscira was nearly destroyed in a jealous fit of rage by the goddess Hera. She was angry that Zeus was magically spying on the bathing form of Artemis via scrying pool and kicked the pool itself. Because of her actions the islands ceased to float in mid-air under their own power and instead resumed being a cluster of traditional islands once more.\n\nRecently, Themyscira was under attack by OMAC forces, as described in DC Comics's \"Infinite Crisis\". Due to this attack, as well as the many various other attacks the island has suffered through since Diana became Wonder Woman, it was decided that the Olympian and Bana-Mighdallian goddesses would transport the island and its inhabitants (sans Diana) to an undisclosed location to live in peace.\n\nUnder the direction of writer Will Pfeifer the Amazons attack Washington D.C. as retaliation for the attack on the island in a six-part mini-series titled \"Amazons Attack\". At the end of the series the Amazons have their memories erased by Granny Goodness (posing as the goddess Athena), and are scattered throughout the world with false personas. Only Hippolyta and four of her original Royal Guard remain on Themyscira. The Queen is exiled to near-empty Themyscira (which had seemingly been sunk and restored during the battle) for her crimes of attacking Man's World, though her actions had been influenced by the evil Circe.\n\nLater, Zeus then revives the Amazons' memories and provides transport for them to return to Themyscira.\n\nWhen the Wonder Woman comic book was first introduced Paradise Island possessed creatures reminiscent of the island country Australia's kangaroos that the Amazons rode like horses called Kangas. Diana's Kanga was named Jumpa. There were also smaller, rabbit-like creatures wandering Paradise Island.\n\nWhen the \"Wonder Woman\" comic book was revamped and started anew in the mid-1980s this was scrapped and the island only had common game animals such as deer, wild boar, horses, and fish. The only exotic/mythological creatures on the island were more sinister in nature and existed in Doom's Doorway to the underworld, which the Amazons swore to keep trapped and never to escape. In the waters surrounding Themyscira also lived Naiads and in the forests Dryads who played most of their days away, occasionally with the Amazons.\n\nIn 1999 when writer Eric Luke took over the Wonder Woman comic book he had several lost mythical creatures from around the globe take asylum on Themyscira. These creatures consisted of: Chiron the Centaur, a white Pegasus, Ladon the Dragon, a chimera, and a Sphinx.\n\nThen when writer Phil Jimenez wrote the title in the early 2000s he had several dinosaurs from the land of Skartaris also take refuge on Themyscira, in addition to the reappearance of Kangas on the island. To date no Kangas have been seen as riding animals.\n\nWriter Greg Rucka reintroduced a second Pegasus to serve as Wonder Woman's riding companion, this one black with red eyes. It is assumed he still lives on Themyscira.\n\nIn 2003, a flashback story by Matt Wagner called \"\" has the island defended by sapient giant birds. They perish in the defense of the Amazons.\n\nThe 2007 storyline \"Amazons Attack!\" depicted the Amazons as having creatures such as giant Stygen wasps and some domesticated winged horses, large amounts of saddled chimeras, and three titan sized ogres. Then in 2007/2008 the \"Countdown to Final Crisis\" storyline introduced the then new revelation that the island is protected by a school of Megalodons.\n\nWhen writer Gail Simone took over the title she showed that Hippolyta cared for griffins in the royal stables. She also introduced the island of Thalarion, the home of Gargareans during the \"Rise of the Olympian\" storyline. The Gargareans possessed herds of winged horses similar to Themyscira but also possessed flocks of winged lions as well. Their leader Achilles also has a domesticated battle elephant named Mysia who has two trunks, two mouths, three glowing eyes, an impenetrable hide, and the ability to walk on air. As the Gargareans incorporated themselves among the Amazons of Themyscira it is safe to assume these creatures also reside there.\n\n\n\n"}

While agriculture remains the primary activity in the interior, and the fisheries industry has declined significantly, construction and industrial enterprises have conquered a prominent role in the municipality. The service industry, particularly tourism, has carved-out a portion of the income stream, with high-quality hotels or residential inns located in the countryside and urban centres.\n\n"}

He was born in Philadelphia and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in English. After working as a schoolteacher and bartender he began to pursue a career in music. His manager Bill Eib, an artist manager and new artist development agent, submitted a demo recording to Blue Note Records which resulted in a recording contract and association with singer Norah Jones.\n\nSince that time Lee has recorded five albums on Blue Note Records and has toured as an opening act for Norah Jones, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, Paul Simon, Merle Haggard, Van Morrison, John Prine, Dave Matthews Band, Adele, the Zac Brown Band, Jack Johnson, The Avett Brothers, and David Gray. His music has appeared on the soundtracks of numerous TV shows and movies. He has performed on several late night TV shows and at a voter registration rally for Barack Obama. In 2011, his album \"Mission Bell\" debuted at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\n\nLee was born Ryan Anthony Massaro in 1977 and was raised in Kensington, Philadelphia. He moved to Cherry Hill, New Jersey at age 11 and graduated from Cherry Hill High School East. Lee attended the University of South Carolina and graduated with a degree in English and a minor in education. During his college years, he developed an interest in music after being inspired \"\". During this period, he began playing the guitar and bass as part of a band and listening to the music of Donny Hathaway, Joni Mitchell, Luther Vandross, Bill Withers, and Otis Redding.\n\nAfter returning to Philadelphia, Lee worked as a second grade teacher at the Mary McLeod Bethune School and as a bartender at local music venues. He performed at open mic events in the area and, through his manager Bill Eib's contacts with promoters, was hired as an opening act for Mose Allison and B.B. King.\n\nIn 2003, Lee's manager Bill Eib sent a four-song demo CD to several record labels, and the representative at Blue Note Records was \"immediately struck by his [Lee's] voice\". Afterwards, Norah Jones heard Lee's music while visiting the record company and invited Lee to be the opening act for her 2004 tour.\n\nThe friendship between Lee's manager Bill Eib and Bob Dylan's manager Jeff Kramer resulted in Lee touring with Dylan as his opening act in early 2005. Later, Lee began touring on his own and recorded his self-titled and \"widely praised\" debut album of \"subtle, folky soul\" produced by Norah Jones' bassist, Lee Alexander which included vocals and instrumentation by Norah Jones and members of her band. After it was released, the album peaked at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Top Heatseekers chart and Lee was named one of \"Rolling Stone\"'s \"Top 10 Artists to Watch.\" One song from the album, called \"Colors\", appeared on the TV show \"Grey's Anatomy\" and in the film \"Just Like Heaven\". Lee's music received additional media attention when he performed on late night TV shows such as the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nIn 2006, Lee recorded his second album, \"Supply and Demand\", which was produced by a friend of manager Bill Eib, Philadelphia musician and producer Barrie Maguire. An NPR Music reviewer described it as having \"more complicated instrumentation and production\" than his prior work. The song \"Shout Out Loud\" was released as a single and peaked at No. 76 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and another song, called \"Sweet Pea\", was used in an AT&T ad campaign.\n\nLee's third studio album, \"Last Days at the Lodge\" was released in 2008 and re-emphasized \"his grounding in folk and soul\".

His music is said to utilize the \"supple funk of his vocals and arid strum of his guitar\" while recalling \"the low-volume, early-'70s acoustic soul of stars like Bill Withers and Minnie Ripperton\". A \"New York Times\" music critic described Lee as having a \"honeyed singing voice – light amber, mildly sweet, a touch of grain\" which he features \"squarely, without much fuss or undue strain\" in his \"1970s folk rock and rustic soul\" musical song craft. According to a music writer at ABC News, Lee \"has that folksy, bluesy vibe, with a bit of country twang\" and a voice that is \"ever soulful\". Simultaneously Lee has been both lauded and dismissed as the \"male Norah Jones\" and his lyrics are said to convey \"the complexities of everyday emotions\" without falling into flowery imagery. Lee's songs have appeared on a number of TV shows including House, and \"Parenthood\".\n\nAmos Lee describes himself as being of mixed heritage; he admits he is not fully aware of his background.

The company is owned by the Cargotec Corporation.\n\nThe name, Hiab, comes from the commonly used abbreviation of Hydrauliska Industri AB, a company founded in Hudiksvall, Sweden 1944 by Eric Sundin, a ski manufacturer who saw a way to utilize a truck's engine to power loader-cranes through the use of hydraulics. Hiab invented the world's first hydraulic truck-mounted crane in 1947. On the other side of the Bothnian Sea in Raisio, Finland about the same time, three brothers, Mikko, Mauno and Martti Terho developed a mechanical cable-operated interchangeable platform-loader (Cablelift) that utilised the truck's front winch, with which it was possible to use a variety of platform bodies. In 1949 they started Multilift to manufacture their innovative load handling equipment. \nThe roots of today's Hiab Company lie in a series of acquisitions from 1977 onwards, when Partek Corporation embarked on a comprehensive diversification and internationalisation strategy. Founded in 1898, Partek Corporation was one of the oldest industrial companies in Finland, originally producing limestone and later a versatile range of materials for the construction industry. In 1977 Partek decided to expand into the engineering industry and thereby decrease its dependence on domestic construction when it first bought named Multilift. Eight years later, in 1985, the company bought Hiab with its forestry-crane subsidiary Jonsered. In 1988 they bought Loglift - as the name implies, also a forestry crane manufacturer.\n\nDuring the late 1990s Partek strategically restructured itself into an engineering company, fully divesting its construction-materials activity and making several acquisitions in the load-handling equipment business.\n\nThe load-handling side of Partek expanded in 2000 with the acquisition of the Zeteco Group (including among others ZEPRO and WALTCO tail lifts). During the same year the truck-mounted forklift business was acquired, bringing today's MOFFETT and PRINCETON PIGGY BACK brands into the company.\n\nKONE Corporation acquired Partek in 2002. In 2004 the load-handling functionality was renamed after its most valuable product brand, HIAB.

Prior to this, the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in urine specimens was dismissed as contamination.\n\nIn humans, \"S. saprophyticus\" is found in the normal flora of the female genital tract and perineum. It has been isolated from other sources, too, including meat and cheese products, vegetables, the environment, and human and animal gastrointestinal tracts. \"S. saprophyticus\" causes 10–20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs). In females 17–27 years old, it is the second-most common cause of community-acquired UTIs, after \"Escherichia coli\". Sexual activity increases the risk of \"S. saprophyticus\" UTIs because bacteria are displaced from the normal flora of the vagina and perineum into the urethra. Most cases occur within 24 hours of sex, earning this infection the nickname \"honeymoon cystitis\". \"S. saprophyticus\" has the capacity to selectively adhere to human urothelium. The adhesin for \"S. saprophyticus\" is a lactosamine structure. \"S. saprophyticus\" produces no exotoxins.\n\nPatients with urinary tract infections caused by \"S. saprophyticus\" usually present with symptomatic cystitis. Symptoms include a burning sensation when passing urine, the urge to urinate more often than usual, a 'dripping effect' after urination, weak bladder, a bloated feeling with sharp razor pains in the lower abdomen around the bladder and ovary areas, and razor-like pains during sexual intercourse. Flank pain has been noted and can be confused with the symptoms of kidney stones. Signs and symptoms of renal involvement are also often registered.\n\nThe urine sediment of a patient with a \"S. saprophyticus\" urinary tract infection has a characteristic appearance under the microscope manifesting leukocytes, erythrocytes, and clumping due to cocci adhering to cellular elements. Chemical screening methods for bacteriuria, such as, urine nitrate and glucose do not always detect \"S. saprophyticus\" infection. This is because unlike Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae urinary tract infections, \"S. saprophyticus\" does not reduce nitrate and has a longer generation time, thus does not consume glucose as rapidly. Even when such an infection occurs above the neck of the bladder, low numbers of colony-forming units (less than 10 cfu/ml) are often present.\n\n\"S. saprophyticus\" is identified as belonging to the genus \"Staphylococcus\" using the Gram stain and catalase test. It is identitified as a species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) using the coagulase test. Lastly, \"S. saprophyticus\" is differentiated from \"S. epidermidis\", another species of pathogenic CoNS, by testing for susceptibility to the antibiotic novobiocin. \"S. saprophyticus\" is novobiocin-resistant, whereas \"S. epidermidis\" is novobiocin-sensitive.\n\n\"S. saprophyticus\" urinary tract infections are usually treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or with a quinolone such as to be alone norfloxacin. It has also been shown to be susceptible to ampicillin & ceftriaxone.\n\nThe many home remedies or natural treatments for urinary tract infections are not clinically proven, such as cranberry juice, alkalinization, and many types of common herbs and spices. Some show promise, such as to affect the formation of biofilms on surfaces or medical equipment, and in other \"in vitro\" situations.\n\nTwo subspecies of \"S. saprophyticus exist\": \"S. s. bovis\" and \"S. s. saprophyticus\", the latter has colony diameter of > 5mm, and more commonly found in human UTIs. \"S. s. saprophyticus\" is nitrate-reductase negative and pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase negative, while \"S. saprophyticus bovis\" has colony diameter of < 5mm, nitrate-reductase positive and pyrolidonyl-arylamidase positive.\n\n"}

It included the city transit lines in Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Oneida and Rome, plus various interurban lines connecting those cities. New York State Railways also held a 50% interest in the Schenectady Railway Company, but it remained a separate independent operation. The New York Central took control of the Rochester Railway Company, the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway and the Rochester and Sodus Bay Railway in 1905, and the Mohawk Valley Company was formed by the railroad to manage these new acquisitions. New York State Railways was formed in 1909 when the properties controlled by the Mohawk Valley Company were merged. In 1912 it added the Rochester and Suburban Railway, the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway, the Oneida Railway, and the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway. The New York Central Railroad was interested in acquiring these lines in an effort to control the competition and to gain control of the lucrative electric utility companies that were behind many of these streetcar and interurban railways. Ridership across the system dropped through the 1920s as operating costs continued to rise, coupled with competition from better highways and private automobile use. New York Central sold New York State Railways in 1928 to a consortium led by investor E. L. Phillips, who was looking to gain control of the upstate utilities. Phillips sold his stake to Associated Gas & Electric in 1929, and the new owners allowed the railway bonds to default. New York State Railways entered receivership on December 30, 1929. The company emerged from receivership in 1934, and local operations were sold off to new private operators between 1938 and 1948.\n\nThe New York Central Railroad took notice to the potential competition arising from the streetcar and electric interurban railways being built in its territory across upstate New York. In an effort to control the competition, the railroad began buying controlling interests in the Rochester Railway Company, the Rochester and Sodus Bay Railway, and the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway. The Mohawk Valley Company was formed in 1905 to manage these properties. The company also controlled the Canandaigua Gas Light Company, the Despatch Heat, Light and Power Company, and the Eastern Monroe Electric Light and Power Company. New York State Railways was incorporated on March 22, 1909, to take over the three railways and consolidate them into a single entity.\n\nA second wave of expansion followed when the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway, the Oneida Railway, the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway, and the Rochester and Suburban Railway were merged into New York State Railways on October 31, 1912. The East Side Traction Company was added on August 28, 1919.\n\nAt its peak, New York State Railways operated 338 miles across Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Oneida, Sodus Bay, Canandaigua, and Geneva. In June 1920, the total value of the New York State Railway Corporation franchise in Syracuse as determined by the New York State Tax Commission was $2,320,000 down from $2,407,000 in 1919.\nPatronage on the streetcar and interurban lines declined in the 1920s, thanks to autos, buses, and paved roads — but the electric utilities owned by the company grew. As a result, in 1928 the New York Central sold its control of the New York State Railways system to what became the \"Associated Gas & Electric Co.\"\n\nShortly after the transaction, the stock market crashed, and on December 30, 1929, the company was put into receivership. Increased competition from private automobile ownership and the construction of better highways forced the closure of the electric interurban railways. An application was made to abandon the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway in November 1929, but the court process was delayed until the following summer when an order was approved to end all service to Geneva on July 31, 1930.\n\nNew York State Railways emerged from receivership in 1934, and gradually the remaining core city lines were sold as separate operations. The Rochester Lines were reorganized as the Rochester Transit Corporation on August 2, 1938. The Syracuse Transit Corporation took over the former Syracuse Lines on November 22, 1939. The last streetcars operated on the Utica Lines on May 12, 1941, but it wasn't until May 1, 1948 that the transit system was reorganized as the Utica Transit Corporation.\n\nThe Rochester Lines were made up of the city and suburban lines operated by Rochester Railway Company, the Canandaigua local service (the former Canandaigua Street Railroad), the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway, and the Rochester and Sodus Bay Railway that were consolidated into New York State Railways in 1909. In 1927, the city-owned Rochester Subway was placed under the operation of New York State Railways on a contract basis with the city of Rochester. Trackless trolleys were briefly operated in Rochester between 1923 and 1932. The first streetcar lines were closed in 1929, including the Exchange, Plymouth, Emerson, and Driving Park routes. Service on the Rochester and Sodus Bay interurban to Sodus Bay was also abandoned the same year, local service to Glen Haven ended in 1933. The Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway shut down its interurban line to Geneva in 1930, the same day local service ended in Canandaigua. The largest streetcar line conversion came in August 1936, when eleven routes (Durand-Eastman Park, Allen, Jefferson, South Clinton, Webster, Clifford, Central Park, Goodman North, Sea Breeze, Hudson, and Joseph) were closed. The following year the Park, West, and University lines were closed. The Rochester Lines were reorganized as Rochester Transit Corporation on August 2, 1938, to operate the remaining bus and streetcar transit lines. Streetcar operation ended in 1941, and the Rochester Subway shut down in 1956. All transit franchises succeeded by Rochester Transit Corporation in 1938 were later transferred to Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority in 1969.\n\nThe Syracuse Lines consisted mainly of the city and suburban operations serving Syracuse. Several smaller streetcar and interurban lines serving the city and suburbs of Syracuse were consolidated into the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway on May 21, 1896. Additional lines were acquired and extended throughout the 1890s. The Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway was merged with New York State Railways in 1912. At its peak, the Syracuse Lines operated more than 200 cars on 100 miles of track over 27 routes. The first streetcar line closure was the Green Street route in September 1927, with no replacement bus service. On May 31, 1930, the Valley via Elmwood and Valley via Salina routes were closed and not replaced with buses. The Burnet line was converted to bus operation On January 22, 1933. The West Genesee and West Solvay lines were closed on June 30, 1933. Additional closures followed on October 31 when the Dudley, Oak, and Park lines were shut down. The Liverpool line succumbed on the last day of 1933. The Oakwood and Summit lines were closed on May 27, 1935, and the Solvay line was the only closure in 1936. The Elmwood, East Syracuse, and Midler lines were shut down on September 15, 1937, with the Minoa route following on October 11. The Court and Midland lines closed on July 31, 1938. The final route closure under New York State Railways would be the University Line on September 30, 1939. The former Syracuse Lines were reorganized as the privately owned Syracuse Transit Corporation on November 22, 1939. All remaining streetcar lines were converted to bus by 1941. In 1972, all transit franchises were succeeded by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority.\nThe Oneida Lines consisted of the city streetcar lines, the Oneida Railway interurban line between Syracuse and Utica (known as the \"Third Rail Line\"), and the Sherrill-Kenwood shuttle. The earliest portion of the Oneida Lines was incorporated in 1885 as the Oneida Railway Company of Oneida, New York (later simplified to Onedia Railway Company in 1903). Opened on July 4, 1885, as a horsecar transit operation, the line stretched 1.5 miles along Main Street from the New York Central Railroad station to the West Shore Railroad station at Oneida Castle. The horsecar operation ended on July 30, 1902, and the railway was shut down while the system was electrified and expanded. When it reopened on December 14, the operation was now 4.4 miles and included an extension to Wampsville.\n\nIn 1905, the Onedia Railway leased a section of the West Shore Railroad from the New York Central Railroad for the purpose of electrifying the line for interurban service between Syracuse and Utica. A connection with the Utica street railways was made at Genesee Street, and with the Syracuse street railways near Burnet Avenue. Service began on June 16, 1907. Cars were powered by a third rail, except when running on the street railways of Syracuse, Oneida, or Utica, where the overhead trolley wire was used instead.\n\nA 1.5 mile spur was constructed from the Onedia Railway station at Sherrill to Kenwood in 1909, and operated as a single-car shuttle meeting all interurban trains. In 1911, an extension of the city streetcar was built to serve the New York, Ontario and Western Railway station at Oneida. In 1912, the Oneida operations were acquired by New York State Railways.\n\nDeclining ridership through the 1920s forced the Sherrill-Kenwood shuttle to suspend operations on August 29, 1927. The shuttle was formally abandoned nearly a year later on July 31, 1928. Ridership on the Onedia Railway declined through the 1920s and the company entered receivership. The last day of service was December 31, 1930. The electrification was removed and control of the line reverted to the West Shore Railroad. Local service on the Oneida street railway ended the same day. There was no immediate successor to the transit franchises of the Onedia Lines once all streetcar and interurban railway operations ceased at the end of 1930. The Central New York Regional Transportation Authority is now responsible for bus transportation in the region formerly served by the Oneida Lines.\n\nThe Utica Lines of New York State Railways was composed mainly of the city and suburban lines serving both Utica and Rome. The various streetcar lines serving Utica were consolidated into the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway in 1901. The Mohawk Valley Line was an interurban connecting Rome, Utica, and Little Falls, constructed between 1902 and 1903. This became the busiest route, with half-hourly service on its double-track main line. The Rome City Street Railroad was merged into the Uitca and Mohawk Valley Railway in 1907. The U&MV was merged into New York State Railways in 1912. The first lines to be closed were the Auburn Avenue and Oneida Street routes in 1925. That same year an amusement park was built near the main carban and shops called Forest Park, which was an immediate success, yet first to feel the effects of the Great Depression, which forced it to close in 1929. The South Woods shuttle also ended service in 1929. The Mohawk Valley Line began to show significant losses starting in 1926, and shut down on June 30, 1933. The steel interurban cars that served on the Mohawk Valley Line were purchased new in 1916, and were the newest equipment on the entire New York State Railways system. The cars were transferred to Rochester Lines in 1936 to upgrade the Rochester Subway, and entered service in 1938 under new operator Rochester Transit Corporation.\n\nThe Rome city lines were never successful, and the first service suspensions came to the James Street line in 1927 and the Madison Street line in 1928. All streetcar service came in Rome to an end on December 7, 1930. In 1931, the North Utica line was closed, and the Eagle Street (6) line followed in 1932. The Lenox (15), Lincoln (10), and Blandina (9) routes closed in 1933, with South Street and Mohawk street following the year after. In 1934 the South Street and Mohawk Street lines were closed, the same year New York State Railways emerged from receivership. The James Street and Clinton lines were shut down in 1936, while the Whitesboro (11) and New York Mills (12) lines were closed in the summer of 1938. The Capron (5) line hung on until April 8, 1941. The last day for streetcar operation in Utica was May 12, 1941, when the New Hartford and Forest Park (16) lines closed. The mayor of Utica was at the controls of Car 310, the last car to roll into the Forest Park carbarn.\n\nThe transit franchises formerly operated by the streetcars were continued by the Copper City Bus Line and the Rome City Bus Line. It wasn't until 1948 that many parts of the former Utica Lines were reorganized as the Utica Transit Corporation. The city-owned Utica Transit Commission took over operations in 1965, which was succeeded by the Utica Transit Authority in 1974. In 2005, the transit operations transferred to the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority and its subsidiaries Centro Rome and Centro Utica.\n"}

{"id": "2220762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220762", "title": "Ego psychology", "text": "Ego psychology\n\nEgo psychology is a school of psychoanalysis rooted in Sigmund Freud's structural id-ego-superego model of the mind.\n\nAn individual interacts with the external world as well as responds to internal forces. Many psychoanalysts use a theoretical construct called the ego to explain how that is done through various ego functions. Adherents of ego psychology focus on the ego's normal and pathological development, its management of libidinal and aggressive impulses, and its adaptation to reality.\n\nSigmund Freud initially considered the ego to be a sense organ for perception of both external and internal stimuli. He thought of the ego as synonymous with consciousness and contrasted it with the repressed unconscious. In 1910, Freud emphasized the attention to detail when referencing psychoanalytical matters, while predicting his theory to become essential in regards to everyday tasks with the Swiss psychoanalyst, Oscar Pfister. By 1911, he referenced ego instincts for the first time in \"Formulations on the Two Principles of Mental Functioning\" and contrasted them with sexual instincts: ego instincts responded to the reality principle while sexual instincts obeyed the pleasure principle. He also introduced attention and memory as ego functions.\n\nFreud later argued that not all unconscious phenomena can be attributed to the id, and that the ego has unconscious aspects as well. This posed a significant problem for his topographic theory, which he resolved in \"The Ego and the Id\" (1923).\n\nIn what came to be called the structural theory, the ego was now a formal component of a three-way system that also included the id and superego. The ego was still organized around conscious perceptual capacities, yet it now had unconscious features responsible for repression and other defensive operations. Freud's ego at this stage was relatively passive and weak; he described it as the helpless rider on the id's horse, more or less obliged to go where the id wished to go.\n\nIn \"Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety\" (1926), Freud revised his theory of anxiety as well as delineated a more robust ego. Freud argued that instinctual drives (id), moral and value judgments (superego), and requirements of external reality all make demands upon an individual. The ego mediates among conflicting pressures and creates the best compromise. Instead of being passive and reactive to the id, the ego was now a formidable counterweight to it, responsible for regulating id impulses, as well as integrating an individual's functioning into a coherent whole. The modifications made by Freud in Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety formed the basis of a psychoanalytic psychology interested in the nature and functions of the ego. This marked the transition of psychoanalysis from being primarily an id psychology, focused on the vicissitudes of the libidinal and aggressive drives as the determinants of both normal and psychopathological functioning, to a period in which the ego was accorded equal importance and was regarded as the prime shaper and modulator of behavior.\n\nFollowing Sigmund Freud, the psychoanalysts most responsible for the development of ego psychology, and its systematization as a formal school of psychoanalytic thought, were Anna Freud, Heinz Hartmann, and David Rapaport. Other important contributors included Ernst Kris, Rudolph Loewenstein, René Spitz, Margaret Mahler, Edith Jacobson, Paul Federn, and Erik Erikson.\n\nAnna Freud focused her attention on the ego's unconscious, defensive operations and introduced many important theoretical and clinical considerations. In \"The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense\" (1936), Anna Freud argued the ego was predisposed to supervise, regulate, and oppose the id through a variety of defenses. She described the defenses available to the ego, linked them to the stages of psychosexual development during which they originated, and identified various psychopathological compromise formations in which they were prominent. Clinically, Anna Freud emphasized that the psychoanalyst's attention should always be on the defensive functions of the ego, which could be observed in the manifest presentation of the patient's associations. The analyst needed to be attuned to the moment-by-moment process of what the patient talked about in order to identify, label, and explore defenses as they appeared. For Anna Freud, direct interpretation of repressed content was less important than understanding the ego's methods by which it kept things out of consciousness. Her work provided a bridge between Freud's structural theory and ego psychology.\n\nHeinz Hartmann (1939/1958) believed the ego included innate capacities that facilitated an individual's ability to adapt to his or her environment. These included perception, attention, memory, concentration, motor coordination, and language. Under normal conditions, what Hartmann called an average expectable environment, these capacities developed into ego functions and had autonomy from the libidinal and aggressive drives; that is, they were not products of frustration and conflict, as Freud (1911) believed. Hartmann recognized, however, that conflicts were part of the human condition and certain ego functions may become conflicted by aggressive and libidinal impulses, as witnessed by conversion disorders (e.g., glove paralysis), speech impediments, eating disorders, and attention-deficit disorder.\n\nThrough Hartmann's focus on ego functions, and how an individual adapts to his or her environment, he worked to create both a general psychology and a clinical instrument with which an analyst could evaluate an individual's functioning and formulate appropriate therapeutic interventions. Based on Hartmann's propositions, the task of the ego psychologist was to neutralize conflicted impulses and expand the conflict-free spheres of ego functions. By doing so, Hartmann believed psychoanalysis facilitated an individual's adaptation to his or her environment. Hartmann claimed, however, that his aim was to understand the mutual regulation of the ego and environment rather than to promote adjustment of the ego to the environment. Furthermore, an individual with a less-conflicted ego would be better able to actively respond to and shape, rather than passively react to, his or her environment.\n\nMitchell and Black (1995) wrote: \"Hartmann powerfully affected the course of psychoanalysis, opening up a crucial investigation of the key processes and vicissitudes of normal development. Hartmann's contributions broadened the scope of psychoanalytic concerns, from psychopathology to general human development, from an isolated, self-contained treatment method to a sweeping intellectual discipline among other disciplines\" (p. 35).\n\nDavid Rapaport played a prominent role in the development of ego psychology and his work likely represented its apex. \nIn Rapaport's influential monograph \"The Structure of Psychoanalytic Theory\" (1960), he organized ego psychology into an integrated, systematic, and hierarchical theory capable of generating empirically testable hypotheses. According to Rapaport, psychoanalytic theory—as expressed through the principles of ego psychology—was a biologically based general psychology that could explain the entire range of human behavior. For Rapaport, this endeavor was fully consistent with Freud's attempts to do the same (e.g., Freud's studies of dreams, jokes, and the \"psychopathology of everyday life\".)\n\nWhile Hartmann was the principal architect ego psychology, he collaborated closely with Ernst Kris and Rudolph Loewenstein.\n\nSubsequent psychoanalysts interested in ego psychology emphasized the importance of early-childhood experiences and socio-cultural influences on ego development. René Spitz (1965), Margaret Mahler (1968), Edith Jacobson (1964), and Erik Erikson studied infant and child behavior and their observations were integrated into ego psychology. Their observational and empirical research described and explained early attachment issues, successful and faulty ego development, and psychological development through interpersonal interactions.\n\nSpitz identified the importance of mother-infant nonverbal emotional reciprocity; Mahler refined the traditional psychosexual developmental phases by adding the separation-individuation process; and Jacobson emphasized how libidinal and aggressive impulses unfolded within the context of early relationships and environmental factors. Finally, Erik Erikson provided a bold reformulation of Freud's biologic, epigenetic psychosexual theory through his explorations of socio-cultural influences on ego development. For Erikson, an individual was pushed by his or her own biological urges and pulled by socio-cultural forces.\n\nIn the United States, ego psychology was the predominant psychoanalytic approach from the 1940s through the 1960s. Initially, this was due to the influx of European psychoanalysts, including prominent ego psychologists like Hartmann, Kris, and Loewenstein, during and after World War II. These European analysts settled throughout the United States and trained the next generation of American psychoanalysts.\n\nBy the 1970s, several challenges to the philosophical, theoretical, and clinical tenets of ego psychology emerged. The most prominent of which were: a \"rebellion\" led by Rapaport's protégés (George Klein, Robert Holt, Roy Schafer, and Merton Gill); object relations theory; and self psychology.\n\nCharles Brenner (1982) attempted to revive ego psychology with a concise and incisive articulation of the fundamental focus of psychoanalysis: intrapsychic conflict and the resulting compromise formations. Over time, Brenner (2002) tried to develop a more clinically based theory, what came to be called “modern conflict theory.” He distanced himself from the formal components of the structural theory and its metapsychological assumptions, and focused entirely on compromise formations.\n\n\nReality testing involves the individual's capacity to understand and accept both physical and social reality as it is consensually defined within a given culture or cultural subgroup. In large measure, the function hinges on the individual's capacity to distinguish between her own wishes or fears (internal reality) and events that occur in the real world (external reality). The ability to make distinctions that are consensually validated determines the ego's capacity to distinguish and mediate between personal expectations, on the one hand, and social expectations or laws of nature on the other. Individuals vary considerably in how they manage this function. When the function is seriously compromised, individuals may withdraw from contact with reality for extended periods of time. This degree of withdrawal is most frequently seen in psychotic conditions. Most times, however, the function is mildly or moderately compromised for a limited period of time, with far less drastic consequences' (Berzoff, 2011).\n\nJudgment involves the capacity to reach “reasonable” conclusions about what is and what is not “appropriate” behavior. Typically, arriving at a “reasonable” conclusion involves the following steps: (1) correlating wishes, feeling states, and memories about prior life experiences with current circumstances; (2) evaluating current circumstances in the context of social expectations and laws of nature (e.g., it is not possible to transport oneself instantly out of an embarrassing situation, no matter how much one wishes to do so); and (3) drawing realistic conclusions about the likely consequences of different possible courses of action. As the definition suggests, judgment is closely related to reality testing, and the two functions are usually evaluated in tandem (Berzoff, 2011).\n\nModulating and controlling impulses is based on the capacity to hold sexual and aggressive feelings in check with out acting on them until the ego has evaluated whether they meet the individual's own moral standards and are acceptable in terms of social norms. Adequate functioning in this area depends on the individual's capacity to tolerate frustration, to delay gratification, and to tolerate anxiety without immediately acting to ameliorate it. Impulse control also depends on the ability to exercise appropriate judgment in situations where the individual is strongly motivated to seek relief from psychological tension and/or to pursue some pleasurable activity (sex, power, fame, money, etc.). Problems in modulation may involve either too little or too much control over impulses (Berzoff, 2011).\n\nModulation of affect The ego performs this function by preventing painful or unacceptable emotional reactions from entering conscious awareness, or by managing the expression of such feelings in ways that do not disrupt either emotional equilibrium or social relationships. To adequately perform this function, the ego constantly monitors the source, intensity, and direction of feeling states, as well as the people toward whom feelings will be directed. Monitoring determines whether such states will be acknowledged or expressed and, if so, in what form. The basic principle to remember in evaluating how well the ego manages this function is that affect modulation may be problematic because of too much or too little expression. \nAs an integral part of the monitoring process, the ego evaluates the type of expression that is most congruent with established social norms. For example, in white American culture it is assumed that individuals will contain themselves and maintain a high level of personal/vocational functioning except in extremely traumatic situations such as death of a family member, very serious illness or terrible accident. This standard is not necessarily the norm in other cultures (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011).\n\nObject relations involves the ability to form and maintain coherent representations of others and of the self. The concept refers not only to the people one interacts with in the external world but also to significant others who are remembered and represented within the mind. Adequate functioning implies the ability to maintain a basically positive view of the other, even when one feels disappointed, frustrated, or angered by the other's behavior. Disturbances in object relations may manifest themselves through an inability to fall in love, emotional coldness, lack of interest in or withdrawal from interactions with others, intense dependency, and/or an excessive need to control relationships (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011).\n\nSelf-esteem regulation involves the capacity to maintain a steady and reasonable level of positive self-regard in the face of distressing or frustrating external events. Painful affective states, including anxiety, depression, shame, and guilt, as well as exhilarating emotions such as triumph, glee, and ecstasy may also undermine self-esteem. Generally speaking, in dominant American culture a measured expression of both pain and pleasure is expressed; excess in either direction is a cause for concern. White Western culture tends to assume that individuals will maintain a consistent and steadily level of self-esteem, regardless of external events or internally generated feeling states (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011).\n\nMastery when conceptualized as an ego function, mastery reflects the epigenetic view that individuals achieve more advanced levels of ego organization by mastering successive developmental challenges. Each stage of psychosexual development (oral, anal, phallic, genital) presents a particular challenge that must be adequately addressed before the individual can move on to the next higher stage. By mastering stage-specific challenges, the ego gains strength in relations to the other structures of the mind and thereby becomes more effective in organizing and synthesizing mental processes. Freud expressed this principle in his statement, “Where id was, shall ego be.” An undeveloped capacity for mastery can be seen, for example, in infants who have not been adequately nourished, stimulated, and protected during the first year of life, in the oral stage of development. When they enter the anal stage, such infants are not well prepared to learn socially acceptable behavior or to control the pleasure they derive from defecating at will. As a result, some of them will experience delays in achieving bowel control and will have difficulty in controlling temper tantrums, while others will sink into a passive, joyless compliance with parental demands that compromises their ability to explore, learn, and become physically competent. Conversely, infants who have been well gratified and adequately stimulated during the oral stage enter the anal stage feeling relatively secure and confident. For the most part, they cooperate in curbing their anal desires, and are eager to win parental approval for doing so. In addition, they are physically active, free to learn and eager to explore. As they gain confidence in their increasingly autonomous physical and mental abilities, they also learn to follow the rules their parents establish and, in doing so, with parental approval. As they master the specific tasks related to the anal stage, they are well prepared to move on to the next stage of development and the next set of challenges. When adults have problems with mastery, they usually enact them in derivative or symbolic ways (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011).\n\nAccording to Freud's structural theory, an individual's libidinal and aggressive impulses are continuously in conflict with his or her own conscience as well as with the limits imposed by reality. In certain circumstances, these conflicts may lead to neurotic symptoms. Thus, the goal of psychoanalytic treatment is to establish a balance between bodily needs, psychological wants, one's own conscience, and social constraints. Ego psychologists argue that the conflict is best addressed by the psychological agency that has the closest relationship to consciousness, unconsciousness, and reality: the ego.\n\nThe clinical technique most commonly associated with ego psychology is \"defense analysis\". Through clarifying, confronting, and interpreting the typical defense mechanisms a patient uses, ego psychologists hope to help the patient gain control over these mechanisms.\n\n\nMany authors have criticized Hartmann's conception of a conflict-free sphere of ego functioning as both incoherent and inconsistent with Freud's vision of psychoanalysis as a science of mental conflict. Freud believed that the ego itself takes shape as a result of the conflict between the id and the external world. The ego, therefore, is inherently a conflicting formation in the mind. To state, as Hartmann did, that the ego contains a conflict-free sphere may not be consistent with key propositions of Freud's structural theory.\n\nEgo psychology, and 'Anna-Freudianism', were together seen by Kleinians as maintaining a conformist, adaptative version of psychoanalysis inconsistent with Freud's own views. Hartmann claimed, however, that his aim was to understand the mutual regulation of the ego and environment rather than to promote adjustment of the ego to the environment. Furthermore, an individual with a less-conflicted ego would be better able to actively respond and shape, rather than passively react to, his or her environment.\n\nJacques Lacan was if anything still more opposed to ego psychology, using his concept of the Imaginary to stress the role of identifications in building up the ego in the first place. Lacan saw in the \"\"non-conflictual sphere\"...a down-at-heel mirage that had already been rejected as untenable by the most academic psychology of introspection'.\n\n"}

He studied at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, entered the Royal Artillery in 1836, was promoted to captain in 1846, and served throughout the Crimean War as brigade-major and assistant adjutant-general of artillery (awarded CB, brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel).\n\nIn the Indian rebellion of 1857 he served on the staff in a similar capacity. Promoted brevet-colonel in 1860, he was specially employed in 1863 in the Northwest frontier of the India campaign, and was Deputy-Adjutant-General, Bengal, from 1863 to 1866, when he returned home. From 1870 to 1875 Adye was Director of Artillery and Stores at the War Office. He was made a KCB in 1873, and was promoted to be major-general and appointed governor of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1875, and Surveyor-General of the Ordnance in 1880. In 1882 he was chief of staff and second in command of the expedition to Egypt, and served throughout the campaign (awarded GCB and thanks of Parliament). He was Governor of Gibraltar from 1883 to 1886 where he was noted for his artwork (see below) and in keeping a good balance between the needs of Gibraltar being a military fortress and of the needs of the civilian population to make a living. The military got rooms for recreation and the civilians enjoyed relaxed trade laws.\nHe was appointed Colonel Commandant of the 4th and 26th (Royal Arsenal) Kent Rifle Volunteer Corps and Honorary Colonel of their successor the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1886, he unsuccessfully contested Bath in the Liberal interest in 1892. \n\nAt some time in his career he became good friends with both William Armstrong and Stuart Rendel, so much so that his daughter, Winifreda, married the former's grand-nephew and heir, William Henry Watson-Armstrong in 1889. His other daughter, Evelyn Violet, was to become John Meade Falkner's wife on 18 October 1899. His son, , would become a major-general. His son, John Adye married Clara Joan Williams in 1899.\n\nAdye was also a writer and artist, describing his experiences in such works as \"A Review of the Crimean War\" (1859), \"Sitana: a Mountain Campaign on the Borders of Afghanistan in 1863\", and \"Recollections of A Military Life\" (1895). His paintings of Gibraltar are available in the Victoria and albert Museum and two of India are in the National Army Museum.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1925 and run for many years by brothers E.J. and Jack Stephani, Nickey Chevrolet became one of the largest factory dealerships, specializing in high performance muscle car sales and service. Nickey Chevrolet's Service Department performed numerous hot rod conversions, and their parts department functioned as a huge speed shop.\n\nNickey Chevrolet was originally established in the 1920s at 4120 Irving Park Road (at the corner of Kedvale and Irving Park Road). When the Kennedy expressway was built in the 1950s, Nickey Chevrolet moved to 4501 W. Irving Park Road in Chicago. Ultimately, Nickey Chevrolet grew to a huge facility. Nickey Chevrolet began its high performance parts business in 1957. Their \"Purple People Eater\" Corvettes became well-known, as did their logo with a backwards \"K\". Nickey Chevrolet became General Motors' largest volume selling dealership for both vehicles and parts, many of the high-performance variety.\n\nThe service department specialized in engine swaps, transplanting 427 cubic inch displacement (CID) \"Big Block\" Chevy engines into the very first 1967 Camaros, and soon there after into Novas, Chevelles, Impalas and even Corvettes. Nickey Chevrolet modified hundreds of cars to their customers’ specifications. A customer could walk into the dealership, pick out a car, and then have it modified to their taste. Most of these domestic modified cars are maintained in museums or private collections and are rarely seen in public.\n\nThe dealership was sold in 1973, and became Keystone Chevrolet. The key players who built Nickey's performance cars and image moved to a new location on Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago. The New Speed Shop and Automobile Conversion Center was named \"Nickey Chicago\". They continued to build legendary Hi-Performance Chevys until 1977 when the speed/performance shop finally closed its doors.\n\nIn 2002 a muscle car collector and enthusiast, Stefano Bimbi, purchased the legal rights and trademarks for the Nickey brand. The new company, Nickey Performance, located in Saint Charles, Illinois, builds, sells and services vehicles branded as Nickey Super Cars, and has also taken steps to establish a registry for Nickey-modified cars.\n"}

A full cannon fired a 42-pound shot, but these were discontinued in the eighteenth century as they were seen as too unwieldy. The lower tiers of seventeenth century English warships were usually equipped with demi-cannons.\n\nShips featuring demi-cannons included HMS \"Sovereign of the Seas\", HMS \"Resolution\" and HMS \"James\", which fought in the Anglo-Dutch naval wars. The barrels of demi-cannon were typically 11 ft (3.4m) long, had a calibre of 6 inches (15.4 cm) and could weigh up to 5600 lb (2540 kg). It required 18 lb (8 kg) of black powder to fire a 32 lb (14.5 kg) round shot. The demi-cannon had an effective range of 1600 ft (490m).\n\nThese 32-pounders were used during the eighteenth century on first-rate three-decker ships of the line which carried up to 100 guns. Though powerful, the naval demi-cannons were inaccurate except at close range so opposing warships would try to get as close as possible before firing their broadside in order to cause as much damage as possible; sometimes a single broadside was enough to cripple the enemy vessel.\n"}

Wildey (May 2, 1922 – October 5, 1994) was an American cartoonist and comic book artist best known for creating the 1964 animated television series \"Jonny Quest\" for Hanna-Barbera Productions.\n\nWildey was born and raised in Yonkers, New York, adjacent to New York City. He did World War II military service at Naval Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii, where he began his art career as a cartoonist for the base newspaper. He recalled his professional start as freelancing for the magazine and comic book company Street & Smith in 1947. Because comic-book writer and artist credits were not routinely given during this era, the earliest confirmed Wildey works are two signed pieces in this publisher's \"Top Secret\" #9 (June 1949): a one-page house ad and the 10-page adventure story \"Queen in Jeopardy\", by an unknown writer.\n\nHe went on to draw primarily Western stories for \"Youthful Magazines\" comics including \"Buffalo Bill\", \"Gunsmoke\" (unrelated to the later television series), and \"Indian Fighter\". He also contributed to the publishers Master Comics, Story Comics, Cross Publications and possibly others, puckishly observing that he'd worked for every publisher except EC, \"the good one\".\n\nIn 1952, Wildey moved his family — wife Ellen and daughter Debbie  — to Tucson, Arizona. Two years later, he began a regular stint at Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics, where he drew dozens of Western stories through 1957, primarily four- and five-page tales in such titles as \"Frontier Western\". His art also appeared in the Atlas horror-fantasy comics \"Journey into Unknown Worlds\", \"Marvel Tales\", \"Mystery Tales\", \"Mystic\", \"Strange Tales\", \"Uncanny Tales\", and others.\n\nHistorian Ken Quattro describes Wildey's most \"noteworthy\" Western as the 19-issue Atlas series \"Outlaw Kid\", \"his take on the classic Western antihero\", in which Wildey illustrated three to four stories per issue:\nMuch of this work was reprinted by Marvel from 1970 through 1974, exposing his work to a later generation.\n\nAfter an Atlas Comics retrenchment in 1957 — during which the company mixed a trove of inventory stories by Wildey and many others with new material for two to three years — Wildey freelanced on a small number of standalone anthology stories for two other publishers: Harvey Comics, in the science fiction/fantasy titles \"Alarming Tales\" #3-5 (Jan.-Sept. 1958), and \"Black Cat Mystic\" #62 (March 1958), \"Hi-School Romance\" #73 (March 1958) and \"Warfront\" #34 (Sept. 1958); and DC Comics, in \"Tales of the Unexpected\" #33 & 35 (Nov. 1958, March 1959), \"House of Secrets\" #17 (Feb.1959), \"My Greatest Adventure\" #28 & 32 (Nov. 1958 & June 1959), and \"House of Mystery\" #89 (Aug. 1959). He also later drew the first issue of Dell Comics' television series spin-off \"Dr. Kildare\", a.k.a. \"Four Color\" #1337, June 1962.\nIn either 1959 or 1961 (sources vary) he took over the art for writer Leslie Charteris' long-running New York Herald Tribune Syndicate comic strip \"The Saint\". Some of their strips were inked by Dick Ayers as the deadlines of producing a daily and Sunday strip proved daunting. The strip ended in 1962. Adding credence to the latter date is Wildey spending part of 1960, possibly only a month, penciling his idol Milton Caniff's famed \"Steve Canyon\" comic strip and trying unsuccessfully to launch his own syndicated strip.\n\nTwo such proposed strips would help provide a character name and some narrative background to Wildey's later animated television series, \"Jonny Quest\". As he described in 1986,\nFollowing the end of \"The Saint\" comic strip in 1962, Wildey found, through an ad in the National Cartoonists Society newsletter, what was initially a one-week television animation job in Los Angeles, California, working under artist Alex Toth on Cambria Productions' 1962 animated series \"Space Angel\". Wildey eventually worked on the series for \"about 12 or 14 weeks\", after which, he recalled in 1986,\n\nWildey wrote and drew a presentation, using such magazines as \"Popular Science\", \"Popular Mechanics\", and \"Science Digest\" \"to project what would be happening 10 years hence\", and devising or fancifully updating such devices as a \"snowskimmer\" and hydrofoils. When Hanna-Barbera could not obtain the rights to Jack Armstrong, the studio had Wildey rework the concept. Wildey \"went home and wrote \"Jonny Quest\" that night — which was not that tough.\" For inspiration he drew on Jackie Cooper and Frankie Darro movies, Milton Caniff's comic strip \"Terry and the Pirates\", and, at the behest of Hanna-Barbera, the James Bond movie \"Dr. No\". Hanna-Barbera refused to give him a \"created by\" credit, Wildey said in 1986, and he and studio \"finally arrived on 'Based on an idea created by', and that was my credit.\"\n\nThe prime-time TV animated series \"Jonny Quest\" debuted on ABC on September 18, 1964. As comics historian Daniel Herman wrote,\nWildey did not design the more cartoonishly-drawn comic relief pet dog, Bandit, which was designed by animator Dick Bickenbach.\n\nWildey went on to work on animated series including \"The Herculoids\", \"Jana of the Jungle\", \"Return to the Planet of the Apes\" (1975), \"Godzilla (1978 TV series)\" (1978), \"Mister T\" (1983), and \"Chuck Norris: Karate Kommandos\" (1986).\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Wildey returned to comic books, drawing stories for the premiere issues of Harvey Comics' \"Thrill-O-Rama\", \"Unearthly Spectaculars\" (both Oct. 1965 series) and \"Double-Dare Adventures\" (Dec. 1965). Most significantly during this time, he collaborated with writer Gaylord DuBois on Gold Key Comics' licensed series \"Tarzan\" when that long-running comic, which had been reprinting stories drawn by Russ Manning, began producing new work beginning with issue #179 (Sept. 1968). The duo's work appeared through issue #187 (Sept. 1969).\n\nAfter a hiatus from comic books, broken only by three 1971 stories for Skywald Publications' black-and-white horror-comics magazines \"Psycho\" and \"Nightmare\", plus the Haunted Tank story \"The Armored Ark\" in DC Comics' \"G.I. Combat\" #153 (May 1972), Wildey created the comic strip \"Ambler\", which ran from 1972 to 1975. Syndicated to newspapers by the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate, the contemporary strip chronicled the adventures of an itinerant folk musician.\n\nAfterward, Wildey returned to comic books to do stories for Archie Comics' horror-humor anthology series \"Mad House\", Gold Key's \"Mystery Comics Digest\", and DC's \"Our Army at War\" and \"Sgt. Rock\", among other titles. Returning to his Western roots, he drew the feature \"Jonah Hex\" in DC's \"Weird Western Tales\" #26 (Feb. 1975) and co-created with writer Larry Lieber the feature \"Kid Cody, Gunfighter\" in Atlas/Seaboard Comics' \"Western Action\" #1 (Feb. 1975).\n\nAs both writer and artist, Wildey created his own Western feature, \"Rio\", that ran in Eclipse Comics' \"Eclipse Monthly\" #1-10 (Aug. 1983 — July 1984), and he returned to his most prominent creation that decade with a \"Jonny Quest\" comic-book series published by . Wildey wrote and drew the stories in \"Jonny Quest\" #1 (July 1986) and \"Jonny Quest Classics\" #1-3 (May–July 1987), and provided several covers. Comico also reprinted several of his Rio stories in a June 1987 one-shot, and Wildey produced new Rio stories for Dark Horse Comics' two-issue miniseries \"Rio at Bay\" (July-Aug. 1992).\n\nHis last original comics work was the painted art for the eight-page Western tale \"The End of the Time of Leinard\" by writers Faye Perozich and Harlan Ellison in Dark Horse's \"Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Special\" (Jan. 1995).\n\nWildey died of heart failure in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 5, 1994.\n\nIn 1971, Jim Vadeboncoeur, Jr. published a Wildey portfolio, \"The Movie Cowboy\", consisting of 26 illustrations sized 12x18 inches. Said historian Quattro, \"Wildey shifted seamlessly between pen and brush, from the finest pen strokes imaginable, to the soft nuances of wash, from the monumental close-up of a grizzled Martin Landau, to the sunny sweetness of two women waiting for a stagecoach.\"\n\n"}

It became an urban sanitary district in 1875, and then under the Local Government Act 1894 became an urban district with a directly elected council. Aston Manor covered the area today known as Aston, including Aston Park, along with Lozells. It was immediately to the north of the county borough of Birmingham. There were extensive manufacturing facilities, including those of motors and cycles with their accessories, also paper-mills, breweries, etc. The population then was largely industrial. The district contained the now publicly owned Aston Hall.\n\nAston Manor was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough in 1903.

The \"Fusiliers Marins\" are also in charge of providing protection for naval vessels and key French Navy sites on land.\n\nThe \"Fusiliers Marins\" are tasked with:\n\nThe \"Fusiliers Marins\" should not be confused with the \"Troupes de Marine\" of the modern French Army. The latter corps has undergone several changes in role from marine infantry to colonial troops (\"Troupes coloniales\") to overseas forces. It has however remained as an essentially land force while the \"Fusiliers Marins\" have throughout their history been an integral part of the French Navy.\n\nIn 1627, Cardinal Richelieu undertook the creation of a Naval Regiment, intended to provide soldiers for service on naval ships. Their roles were to include combat on both land or sea, under the orders of the officers of the ship. These sea-going soldiers formed part of the ship's company and helped with its sailing. The basic units were the Compagnies Franches de la Marine: separate detachments of about 70 men, each commanded by a royal \"lieutenant des vaisseaux\", supported by two ensigns. The marine companies served in the French colonies of the period and particularly in \"Nouvelle-France\". These formations existed under differing titles until 1825, when they were dissolved by a royal ordinance decreeing that landing parties (\"compagnies de débarquement\") be made up of sailors. The Régiments de la Marine were subsequently succeeded by the Troupes de la marine, which later became the colonial troops (\"Troupes Coloniales\") of the French Army, specifically raised for overseas service.\n\nThese companies lacked specialized personnel trained for combat on land.\n\nAn Imperial decree dated 5 June 1856, created the Fusiliers Marins, whose formation and training were undertaken by a battalion stationed at Lorient, Brittany. This specialized corps was put under the command of the captains and sergeants-at-arms of the various naval vessels of the French fleet, and was the direct ancestor of the modern Fusiliers Marins.\n\nSince that date, the Fusiliers Marins have participated the following conflicts:\n\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, following the disaster of Sedan, several brigades of \"Fusiliers Marins\" and naval artillerymen were engaged in combat at Bapaume and subsequently participated in the defense of Paris, notably at the Bourget and at L'Haÿ-les-Roses. This force formed part of the Government \"Armée versaillaise\" () employed in the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871.\nA detachment of \"fusiliers marins\" defended the French Legation (diplomatic mission) in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Amongst their officers was enseigne de vaisseau Paul Henry and Pierre Alexis Ronarc'h, who, in 1914, would serve as Counter-Admiral and Commandant of the Brigade de Fusiliers Marins BFM attached to the 32nd Army Corps.\n\nThe Brigade de Fusiliers Marins distinguished themselves at Dixmude, on the Yser, at Longewaede, Hailles and Laffaux during the early stages of World War I. Three French ships have been named after Dixmude.\n\nThe Fusiliers Marins participated in the campaigns of Free France. They initially formed a battalion then the 1 Régiment de Fusiliers Marins 1 RFM at the corps of the 1st Free French Division (1 DFL) and the 1 Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos (1 BFMC) who served in 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. The 177 Commandos Kieffer who disembarked on 6 June in Normandy, were Fusiliers Marins forming part of the Free France Forces. Other Fusiliers Marins, drawn from the former Armée de Vichy, formed the Régiment Blindé de Fusiliers-Marins (RBFM) which served efficiently as part of the 2nd Armored Division. On 30 April 1945 the Fusiliers Marins played a role in the liberation of the Île d'Oléron. Disembarked at 0620 at Gatseau, an FM detachment advanced slowly through forested terrain facing a stern resistance.\n\nIn 1945, the Far Eastern Marine Brigade (BMEO) was created with the RBFM and the 1 RFM. Based on the request of general Leclerc, the Marine Brigade formed river brigades in 1945-1946. They became the Dinassaut, which operated in Tonkin and Cochinchina from 1947 to 1954. In 1956, with operational cadres serving in Algeria; the Demi-Brigade of Fusiliers Marins (DBFM) was created to play a leading role in securing the borders between Algeria and Morocco until 1962. This demi-brigade was under the command of Vessel Commander (CV) Ponchardier.\n\nThe French Fusiliers Marins are a specialised marine corps of the French Navy, similar to (for example) the Royal Marines of the Royal Navy, the Spanish Navy Marines (Spanish Navy), the San Marco Marine Brigade (Italian Navy), and the United States Marine Corps of the United States Navy.\n\nThe Naval Fusiliers wear a dark blue beret in their combat dress uniforms, pulled right with their own distinctive badge worn over the left eye or temple. Along with the Naval Commandos, they are unique among French forces in wearing the beret this way. When wearing regular dress uniforms, the sailor cap is used by junior ratings and the peaked cap by senior petty officers and officers.\n\nAssault Rifles\n\nSniper Rifles\n\nShotguns\n\nPistols\n\nNon-lethal\n\nMachine Guns\n\nRocket Launchers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This family includes two genera, \"Malapterurus\" and \"Paradoxoglanis\", with 21 species. Several species of this family have the ability to produce an electric shock of up to 350 volts using electroplaques of an electric organ. Electric catfish are found in tropical Africa and the Nile River. Electric catfish are usually nocturnal and carnivorous. Some species feed primarily on other fish, incapacitating their prey with electric discharges, but others are generalist bottom foragers, feeding on things like invertebrates, fish eggs, and detritus. The largest can grow to about long, but most species are far smaller.\n\nThe Malapteruridae are the only group of catfish with well developed electrogenic organs; however, electroreceptive systems are widespread in catfishes. The electrogenic organ is derived from anterior body musculature and lines the body cavity. Electric catfish do not have dorsal fins or fin spines. They have three pairs of barbels (the nasal pair is absent). The swim bladder has elongate posterior chambers, two chambers in \"Malapterurus\" and three in \"Paradoxoglanis\".\n\n\"Malapterurus\" have been conditioned by means of reward to discharge on signal. As reported in the \"New York Times\", April 2, 1967, a researcher, Dr. Frank J. Mandriota of City College, New York, conditioned an \"M. electricus\" to discharge on a light signal for a reward of live worms delivered automatically. This is the first conditioning that modified neither glandular nor muscular responses.\n\nThe largest can grow to about SL and . Most \"Malapterurus\" and all \"Paradoxoglanis\" species are much smaller, reaching less than long.\n\nThe electric catfish of the Nile was well known to the ancient Egyptians. The Egyptians reputedly used the electric shock from them when treating arthritis pain. They would use only smaller fish, as a large fish may generate an electric shock from 300 to 400 volts. The Egyptians depicted the fish in their mural paintings and elsewhere; the first known depiction of an electric catfish is on a slate palette of the predynastic Egyptian ruler Narmer about 3100 BC. It was suitably called \"angry catfish\" in ancient Egyptian.\n\nAn account of its electric properties was given by an Arab physician of the 12th century; then as now, the fish was known by the suggestive name of , which means \"thunder\" (literally \"trembler\" or \"shaker\").\n\nThe shock of these catfish is used to stun prey and in defense. It is not known to be fatal to humans, but large electric catfish can stun an adult person. In small electric catfish the generated current is far less and only feels like a tingle to humans.\n"}

As working animals, different military animals serve different functions. Horses, elephants, camels, and other animals have been used for both transportation and mounted attack. Pigeons were used for communication and photographic espionage. Many other animals have been reportedly used in various specialized military functions, including rats and pigs. Dogs have long been employed in a wide variety of military purposes, more recently focusing on guarding and bomb detection, and along with dolphins and sea lions are in active use today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoming pigeons have seen use since medieval times for carrying messages. They were still employed for a similar purpose during World War I and World War II. In World War II, experiments were also performed in the use of the pigeon for guiding missiles, known as Project Pigeon. The pigeon was placed inside so that they could see out through a window. They were trained to peck at controls to the left or right, depending on the location of a target shape.\n\nSome dogs also saw use as messengers.\n\nThere is a long-standing tradition of military mascots – animals associated with military units that act as emblems, pets or take part in ceremonies.\n\nIn the years before the First World War pigeon photography was introduced to military intelligence gathering. Although employed during major battles like at Verdun and Somme, the method was not particularly successful. Various attempts in this direction were made during the Second World War as well. A CIA pigeon camera dating from the 1970s is displayed in the CIA Museum; details of CIA missions using this camera are still classified.\n\nThe Acoustic Kitty was a CIA project to use surgically modified cats to spy on the Kremlin and Soviet embassies in the 1960s. Despite expenditure of around $10 million, the project failed to produce practical results and was cancelled in 1967. Documents about the project were declassified in 2001.\n\nIn 2006, \"The Independent\" ran a story that the \"Pentagon develops brain implants to turn sharks into military spies\".\n\nIn 2007 Iranian authorities captured 14 squirrels, which were allegedly carrying spying equipment. The story was widely dismissed in the West as \"nuts\".\n\nA number of spying scares in the Middle East involved birds. According to Israeli ornithologist Yossi Leshem, Sudanese authorities detained an Egyptian vulture in the late 1970s, and a white pelican in the early 1980s, both carrying Israeli equipment used for animal migration tracking. A more mediatized event was the 2011 capture by a Saudi farmer of a griffon vulture, which was eventually released by the Saudi authorities after they determined that the Israeli equipment it carried was used for scientific purposes. This was followed by international mockery and criticism of the Arab media outlets which uncritically had reported on the bird's alleged role in espionage. In 2012, a dead European bee-eater tagged with an Israeli leg band was found by villagers near the south-eastern Turkish city of Gaziantep. The villagers worried that the bird may have carried a micro-chip from Israeli intelligence to spy on the area. Turkish authorities examined the corpse of the bee-eater and assured villagers that it is common to equip migratory birds with rings in order to track their movements.\n\nDogs have been used for detecting mines; they were trained to spot trip wires, as well as mines and other booby traps. They were also employed for sentry duty, and to spot snipers or hidden enemy forces.\n\nOn land, giant pouched rats such as the Gambian giant pouched rat have been tested with considerable success as specialised mine detecting animals, as their keen sense of smell helps in the identification of explosives and their small size prevents them from triggering land mines.\n\nChickens were used during the Gulf Wars to detect poisonous gases in an operation called Kuwaiti Field Chicken (KFC); the designation of the US Marines for chickens used in this role was Poultry Chemical Confirmation Devices. The plan was put on hold after 41 of 43 chicken used for such purposes died within a week of arrival in Kuwait. During the First Gulf War, the \"Weekly World News\" published a fictional account how such a chicken was awarded a medal after saving a French general's life.\n\nBeginning during the Cold War, research has been done into the uses of many species of marine mammals for military purposes. The U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program uses military dolphins and sea lions for underwater sentry duty, mine clearance, and object recovery.\n\nCats were used in the Royal Navy to control vermin on board ships. Able seacat Simon of HMS \"Amethyst\" received the Dickin Medal.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), Nationalist pilots attached fragile supplies to live turkeys, which descended flapping their wings, thus serving as parachutes which could also be eaten by the defenders of the monastery of Santa Maria de la Cabeza.\n\nFurthermore, use of military chickens was proposed in the British Blue Peacock project. The scheme involved burying nuclear bombs in the ground for later detonation should occupied (West) Germany be overrun by Warsaw Pact forces. The primitive electronic devices of the 1950s were unreliable in frozen ground, and the chickens were considered as a source of biogenic heat. This story has often been reported as an April Fool's joke, but when it was declassified and proven to be a true story on 1 April 2004 (April Fool's Day), the head of education and interpretation at the UK National Archives said, \"It does seem like an April Fool but it most certainly is not. The Civil Service does not do jokes.\"\n\n\nDuring the British occupation of Basra, rumours of \"man-eating badgers\" emerged from the local population, including allegations that these beasts were released by the British troops, something that the British strenuously denied. The event received coverage in the Western press during the 2007 silly season.\n\n\n\n"}

The Austrian city Braunau am Inn lies on the opposite side of the river from Simbach.\n\nSimbach was one of the first places where electricity was used.

This 1.4 metre high monolith is believed to date from the post-Roman period and carries the inscription \"CORBALENGI IACIT ORDOVS\". The stone was first noted by Edward Lhywd in 1695 who described it as being in a field near the church. It was originally associated with a cairn of smaller stones beneath which was discovered an urn of ashes and a Roman gold coin dating to AD 69 along with silver and bronze coins. The final word 'Ordovs' of the inscription (after IACIT, \"lies\") is believed to refer to the Ordovices tribe of North Wales, with the suggestion that the stone was carved by local tribes in honour of a member of the Ordovices who had settled in the area.\n\nOther readings and interpretations are: \"\"Cor Balenci jacit Ordous\"\", interpreted as: \"The Heart of Balengus the Ordovician lies here\", and \"CORBALENGI LACIT ORDOVS\" (\"Lacit\" = \"thrashed\", rather than \"Iacit\" = lies), in which case it would refer to a tribal battle between the Ordovices and the \"Corbalengi\". Although the Ordovices are reasonably well known, no other record of a Corbalengi tribe is known.\n\nThe Grade I listed church of St. Michael is of particular interest due to its medieval slate roof. The location of the church on a promontory above the sea is said to be from where Penbryn, meaning \"Hill Head\", derives its name. The church stands in a circular churchyard, suggesting its construction on a previous Druidical site, tradition being that this would leave nowhere for the devil to hide. The church is built of local stone, with a 13th-century nave, a 14th-century chancel and a 17th-century porch. The church was renovated in 1887 and 1957. \nThe ancient Llanborth mansion, owned by the Vaughan family, was on the site of the current farmhouse next to the beach car park, whilst the Tudor mansion of Duffryn Hownant lay inland, higher up the valley. No evidence of either now remains. In the 18th century, Penbryn was well known as a landing place for smuggled goods, being described as a \"dark country\" by the Methodist leader Howell Harries on a visit to the area in the 1740s. The wooded valley through which the river Hoffnant flows to the beach is known as Cwm Lladron (\"Robbers' Valley\") to reflect this. During the 18th century the beach was also used as a landing place for fishing boats and trading vessels, including those bringing lime from south Pembrokeshire for use as fertiliser on the acidic soils of Ceredigion. This trade had ceased by the 1860s due to the exposed and hazardous shoreline.\n\nDuring the 19th century the Penbryn area was predominantly Nonconformist in religious persuasion, and in June 1843 during the Rebecca Riots, the vicar of the parish received a letter from \"Rebecca\" threatening to \"cut off your arm and your leg and ...burn all that you have\" should he refuse to return a family bible taken from a poor parishioner who was unable to pay his tithes.\n\nDiscontentment with the church and the tithe system continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and there was anti-tithe rioting in the 1880s and 1890s. This resulted in regular requests by bailiffs visiting the area to collect tithe monies for police protection against attack. One such incident occurred on 19 March 1889, when police and bailiffs were set upon by an angry crowd wielding pitchforks and a knife.\n\nPenbryn is in the valley of the River Hoffnant, close to its mouth at Traeth Penbryn.\n\nThe community of Penbryn also includes the villages of Tre-saith, Brynhoffnant, Glynarthen, and Tan-y-groes.\n\nTraeth Penbryn is a popular long sandy beach with a car park. It is owned by the National Trust, and was a location in the James Bond film \"Die Another Day\". There are several caves at the north end of the beach and at low tide a further large sandy bay can be accessed along the beach to the north and Tresaith can be reached to the west. Penbryn lies on the Ceredigion Coast Path with steep routes along the cliff tops.\n\nAt the 2011 census the population of the community of Penbryn was 1,270, of whom 49.7% were able to speak Welsh. This was a fall in Welsh speakers of 3.8% from the 2001 census. There is an electoral ward of Penbryn (for Ceredigion council) which extends beyond the Penbryn community and has a total population of 2,045.\n\n"}
{"id": "2220844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220844", "title": "Hide (unit)", "text": "Hide (unit)\n\nThe hide was an English unit of land measurement originally intended to represent the amount of land sufficient to support a household. It was traditionally taken to be , but was in fact a measure of value and tax assessment, including obligations for food-rent ('), maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications, manpower for the army ('), and (eventually) the \"\" land tax. The hide's method of calculation is now obscure: different properties with the same hidage could vary greatly in extent even in the same county. Following the Norman Conquest of England, the hidage assessments were recorded in the Domesday Book and there was a tendency for land producing £1 of income per year to be assessed at 1 hide. The Norman kings continued to use the unit for their tax assessments until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe hide was divided into 4 yardlands or virgates. It was hence nominally equivalent in area to a carucate, a unit used in the Danelaw.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon word for a hide was \"hid\" (or its synonym \"hiwisc\"). Both words are believed to be derived from the same root \"hiwan\", which meant \"family\".\n\nBede in his \"Ecclesiastical History\" (c. 731) describes the extent of a territory by the number of families which it supported, as (for instance), in Latin, \"terra x familiarum\" meaning 'a territory of ten families'. In the Anglo-Saxon version of the same work \"hid\" or \"hiwan\" is used in place of \"terra ... familiarum\". Other documents of the period show the same equivalence and it is clear that the word hide originally signified land sufficient for the support of a peasant and his household or of a 'family', which may have had an extended meaning. It is uncertain whether it meant the immediate family or a more extensive group.\n\nCharles-Edwards suggests that in its early usage it referred to the land of one family, worked by one plough and that ownership of a hide conferred the status of a freeman, to whom Stenton referred as \"the independent master of a peasant household\".\n\nHides of land formed the basis for tax levies used to equip free warriors (\"miles\") of the Holy Roman Empire. In 807 it was specified that in the region west of the Seine, for example, a vassal who held four or five hides was responsible for showing up to a muster in person, fully equipped for war. Three men who each possessed one hide, though, merely were grouped such that two of them were responsible for equipping the third, who would go to war in their name. Those holding half-hides were responsible for readying one man for every group of six. This came about as a way of ensuring that the liege took to the field with a fully equipped and provisioned force.\n\nIn early Anglo-Saxon England, the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of food rent (known as \"feorm\") due from a village or estate and it became the unit on which all public obligations were assessed, including in particular the maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications and the provision of troops for manning the defences of a town or for the defence force known as the 'fyrd'. For instance, at one period, five hides were expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep.\n\nA land tax known as geld was first levied in 990 and this became known as the Danegeld, as it was used to buy off the Danes who were then raiding and invading the country. It was raised again for the same purpose on several occasions. The already existing system of assessment of land in hides was utilised to raise the geld, which was levied at a stated rate per hide (e.g. two shillings per hide). Subsequently the same system was used for general taxation and the geld was raised as required.\n\nThe hide was a measure of value rather than a measurement of area, but the logic of its assessment is not easy to understand, especially as assessments were changed from time to time and not always consistently. By the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was a measure of 'the taxable worth of an area of land', but it had no fixed relationship to its area, the number of ploughteams working on it, or its population; nor was it limited to the arable land on an estate. According to Bailey, \"It is a commonplace that the hide in 1086 had a very variable extent on the ground; the old concept of 120 acres cannot be sustained.\" Many details of the development of the system during the 350 years which elapsed between the time of Bede and the Domesday Book remain obscure. According to Sir Frank Stenton, \"Despite the work of many great scholars the hide of early English texts remains a term of elusive meaning.\" The fact that assessments consistently tended to be made in units of 5 hides or multiples of 5 hides goes to show that we are not speaking of fixed or even approximate acreages and this applies not only to the 11th century but to charters of the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\nNevertheless, the hide became the basis of an artificial system of assessment of land for purposes of taxation, which lasted for a long period. The most consistent aspect of the hide is described as follows by Dr Sally Harvey (referring particularly to Domesday Book): \"Both Maitland and Vinogradoff long ago noticed that there was a general tendency throughout Domesday for a hide of land to be worth £1, or, put another way, for land producing £1 of income to be assessed at one hide.\"\n\nA number of early documents referring to hides have survived, but these can only be seen as steps in the development of the concept of the hide and do not enable us to see the full story.\n\nThe document known as the Tribal Hidage is a very early list thought to date possibly from the 7th century, but known only from a later and unreliable manuscript. It is a list of tribes and small kingdoms owing tribute to an overlord and of the proportionate liability or quota imposed on each of them. This is expressed in terms of hides, though we have no details as to how these were arrived at nor how they were converted into a cash liability.\n\nThe Burghal Hidage (early 10th century) is a list of boroughs giving the hide assessments of neighbouring districts which were liable to contribute to the defence of the borough, each contributing to the maintenance and manning of the fortifications in proportion to the number of hides for which they answered.\n\nThe County Hidage (early 11th century) lists the total number of hides to be assessed on each county and it seems that by this time at least the total number of hides in a given area was imposed from above. Each county was assigned a round number of hides, for which it would be required to answer. For instance, at an early date in the 11th century, Northamptonshire was assigned 3,200 hides, while Staffordshire was assigned only 500. This number was then divided up between the hundreds in the county. Theoretically there were 100 hides in each hundred, but this proportion was often not maintained, for example because of changes in the hundreds or in the estates comprising them or because assessments were altered when the actual cash liability was perceived as being too high or too low or for other reasons now unknown.\n\nThe hides within each hundred were then divided between villages, estates or manors, usually in blocks or multiples of 5 hides, though this was not always maintained. Differences from the norm could result from estates being moved from one hundred to another, or from adjustments to the size of an estate or alterations in the number of hides for which an estate should answer.\n\nAs each local community had the task of deciding how its quota of hides should be divided between the lands held by that community, different communities used different criteria, depending on the type of land held and on the way in which an individual's wealth was reckoned within that community, it is self-evident that no single comprehensive definition is possible.\n\nThe Norman kings, after the Norman Conquest, continued to use the system which they found in place. Geld was levied at intervals on the existing hidage assessments. In 1084, William I laid an exceptionally heavy geld of six shillings upon every hide. At the time the value of the hide was approximating twenty shillings a year, and the price of an ox was two shillings. Thus the holder of a hide had a tax burden equivalent to three of his oxen and close upon one-third of the annual value of his land. A more normal rate was 2 shillings on each hide.\n\nDomesday Book, recording the results of the survey made on the orders of William I in 1086, states in hides (or carucates or sulungs as the case might be) the assessed values of estates throughout the area covered by the survey. Usually it gives this information for 1086 and 1066, but some counties were different and only showed this information for one of those dates. By that time the assessments showed many anomalies. Many of the hide assessments on lands held by tenants-in-chief were reduced between 1066 and 1086 in order to effect an exemption from or reduction in tax; this again shows that the hide is a tax assessment, not an area of land.\n\nSometimes, the assessment in hides is given both for the whole manor and for the demesne land (i.e. the lord's own demesne) included in it. Dr Sally Harvey has suggested that the ploughland data in Domesday Book was intended to be used for a complete re-assessment but, if so, it was never actually made. The Pipe Rolls, where they are available, show that levies were based largely on the old assessments, though with some amendments and exemptions.\n\nThe last recorded levy was for 1162-3 during the reign of Henry II, but the tax was not formally abolished and Henry II thought of using it again between 1173 and 1175. The old assessments were used for a tax on land in 1193-4 to raise money for King Richard's ransom.\n\nA hide was usually made up of four virgates although exceptionally Sussex had eight virgates to the hide. A similar measure was used in the northern Danelaw, known as a carucate, consisting of eight bovates, and Kent used a system based on a \"sulung\", consisting of four yokes, which was larger than the hide and on occasion treated as equivalent to two hides. These measures had a different origin, signifying the amount of land which could be cultivated by one plough team as opposed to a family holding, but all later became artificial fiscal assessments.\n\nIn some counties in Domesday Book (e.g. Cambridgeshire), the hide is sometimes shown as consisting of 120 acres (30 acres to the virgate), but as Darby explains: \"The acres are, of course, not units of area, but geld acres, i.e. units of assessment\". In other words, this was a way of dividing the tax assessment on the hide between several owners of parts of the land assessed. The owner of land assessed at 40 notional (or 'fiscal') acres in a village assessed at 10 hides and paying geld of 2 shillings per hide would be responsible for one-third () of 2 shillings—that is, 8 pence—though his land might be considerably more or less than 40 modern statute acres in extent.\n\n\nMuch work has been done investigating the hidation of various counties and also in attempts to discover more about the origin and development of the hide and the purposes for which it was used, but without producing many clear conclusions which would help the general reader.

The village lies four miles (6.5 km) northeast of St Austell and six miles (10 km) south of Bodmin. The population of the parish was 1,371 in the 2001 census. This had risen to 1,381 at the 2011 census.\n\nLuxulyan parish lies in an area of china clay quarries on the St Austell granite batholith (\"see also Geology of Cornwall\") and numerous small granite domes are dotted around the parish. Luxulyan Quarry, a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest to the north of the village, exposes examples of this rock.\n\nLuxulyanite, a rare type of Cornish granite (named after the village) is found in the area and was used for the Duke of Wellington's sarcophagus in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nLuxulyan is best known for Luxulyan Valley, a steep sided and thickly wooded stretch of the valley of the River Par that contains a major concentration of early 19th century industrial remains, including a combined Aqueduct and Viaduct. The valley was designated a World Heritage Site in 2006.\n\nOne of the southern branches of the Saints' Way long-distance footpath runs through the parish. Other villages in Luxulyan parish include the Churchtown, Bridges, Treskilling, Rosemelling, Higher Menadue, and Bodwen.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Line from Par to Newquay runs up the Luxulyan Valley and there is a station at Luxulyan. A bus service connects the village with St Austell.\n\nSt Sulien, or Sulian, was abbot here during the sixth century. The church in the village may have been dedicated to him originally, but it is now dedicated to Saints Ciricius (Cyr, Cyriacus, Quiricus) and Julitta.\n\nThere are roads in Luxulyan named after all three saints. Sulien is a Welsh variant of the given name \"Julian,\" but has also been interpreted as being derived from the Welsh \"sul\", meaning \"sun\" + \"geni\", meaning \"born,\" Sulien being the name of a Celtic solar deity.\n\nIn the early 1980s Luxulyan was the site of a six-month occupation of farmland by much of the village population, with many groups and individuals from across Cornwall helping, to prevent test drilling by the Central Electricity Generating Board investigating the area as a potential nuclear power station site.\n\nLuxulyan has benefited from increased tourism since the nearby Eden Project opened.\n\nArthur Langdon (1896) recorded three Cornish crosses and one cross base in the parish. One cross is in the churchyard (\"illustrated above right\"); it was brought there in the 19th century from Three Stiles near Consence. Another cross is at Methrose and the third at Trevellan (lying horizontally and built into a hedge). The cross base is at Trevellan Lane End. Andrew Langdon (1994) does not mention the cross at Methrose. Trevellan Cross was removed from the hedge and erected at Lockengate in 1903; in 1972 it was moved a few yards to the crossroads on the A391.\n\nThe parish church, originally Norman, was entirely rebuilt in granite in the 15th century. It is dedicated to St Ciricius and St Julitta. The tower is without buttresses or pinnacles and the south porch has battlements and a handsome tunnel-vault. It still has the Norman font (very similar to that at St Austell) and the east window is a monument to Silvanus Trevail, d. 1903. Near the church is a holy well (also 15th century). The Cornish Stannary Court of the Tinners' Parliament kept its records, seal and charter stored in a turret of the church tower. During the English Civil War these were removed to Lostwithiel and then disappeared.\n\nPrideaux House was built in 1808 for Sir John Colman Rashleigh. It is a square granite block of three by three bays and has a double depth plan. Above the stairwell is a rectangular lantern. The service wing to the rear is of the same date. Behind the house on higher ground is the earlier Prideaux manor house, Prideaux Old Manor. It was built in the 16th century but has been much altered since then and in the 19th century was used as stables.\n\nMethrose is a farmhouse probably of the early 16th century (\"one of the best farmhouses in Cornwall\"—Pevsner); it is built of granite and stands on the right of a courtyard. The service end is of two storeys and the later parlour wing was attributed by Charles Henderson to Nicholas Kendall (some time between 1622 and 1649).\n\nThe remains of an Iron-Age hillfort known as Prideaux Castle are located in the southern portion of the parish near the border with St Blazey.\n\nIn 1864 a dispute arose over silver and gold coins, from the reigns of Queen Elizabeth, King James and King Charles I, which were found in the parish churchyard. The Duchy of Cornwall had asserted its right to them as treasure trove, but the Solicitor to the Treasury questioned this, asking for copy documents under which \"\"the claim of the Duchy was founded.\"\" The Duchy sent copies of the Charters of its creation and correspondence stating that, as the Coroner is the officer responsible for treasure trove, and the Duke has the right of appointing the Coroner within Cornwall, the treasure trove belonged to the Duchy. It also argued that the 3rd Duchy Charter \"\"expressly prohibits any such Minister of the Crown acting within Cornwall.\"\" In response the Government Attorney and Solicitor General advised that the Treasury back down as could not hold an Inquest of Treasure within the Duchy of Cornwall and that they could not execute any writs because of the exclusion of all Ministers of the Crown from entering any lands of the Duchy.\n\nNotable people from Luxulyan include William O'Bryan, the Methodist preacher and founder of the Bryanites or Bible Christians, and Silvanus Trevail, the architect. Both were born in the parish.\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes referred-to as \"ground hugging\" or \"terrain hugging\" flight. The term \"nap-of-the-earth\" flight may also apply but is more commonly used in relation to low-flying military helicopters, which typically do not use terrain-following radar. The technology was originally developed by Ferranti for use with the TSR-2 aircraft.\n\nThe system works by transmitting a radar signal towards the ground area in front of the aircraft. The radar returns can then be processed to see how the terrain ahead varies, and then used by the aircraft's flight computers to calculate flight-path changes in order to maintain a reasonably constant height above the earth. The computer will consider many factors in determining the flight path for the aircraft, such as distance to the forward terrain, aircraft speed and velocity, angle of attack and quality of signal being returned.\n\nTerrain following radar is primarily used by military strike aircraft, to enable flight at very low altitudes (sometimes below 100 feet/30 metres) and high speeds. Since radar detection by enemy radars and interception by anti-aircraft systems require a line of sight to the target, flying low to the ground and at high speed reduces the time that an aircraft is vulnerable to detection to a minimum by hiding the aircraft behind terrain as far as possible. This is known as terrain masking.\n\nHowever, radar emissions can be detected by enemy anti-aircraft systems with relative ease once there is no covering terrain, allowing the aircraft to be targeted. The use of terrain-following radar is therefore a compromise between the increased survivability due to terrain masking and the ease with which the aircraft can be targeted if it is seen.\n\nEven an automated system has limitations, and all aircraft with terrain-following radars have limits on how low and fast they can fly. Factors such as system response-time, aircraft g-limits and the weather can all limit an aircraft. Since the radar cannot tell what is beyond any immediate terrain, the flight path may also suffer from \"ballooning\" over sharp terrain ridges, where the altitude becomes unnecessarily high. Furthermore, obstacles such as radio antennas and electricity pylons may be detected late by the radar and present collision hazards.\n\nOn aircraft with more than one crew, the radar is normally used by the navigator and this allows the pilot to focus on other aspects of the flight besides the extremely intensive task of low flying itself. Most aircraft allow the pilot to also select the ride \"hardness\" with a cockpit switch, to choose between how closely the aircraft tries to keep itself close to the ground and the forces exerted on the pilot.\n\nSome aircraft such as the Tornado IDS have two separate radars, with the smaller one used for terrain-following. However more modern aircraft such as the Rafale with phased array radars have a single antenna that can be used to look forward and at the ground, by electronically steering the beams.\n\nTerrain-following radar is sometimes used by civilian aircraft that map the ground and wish to maintain a constant height over it.\n\nMilitary helicopters may also have terrain-following radar. Due to their lower speed and high maneuverability, helicopters are normally able to fly lower than fixed-wing aircraft.\n\nThere are very few alternatives to using terrain-following radar for high-speed, low altitude flight. TERPROM, a terrain-referenced navigation system provides a limited but passive terrain-following functionality.\n\n\n"}

Additionally, he has performed as a solo act, and his cover of the unreleased Bon Jovi song \"Does Anybody Really Fall In Love Anymore\" (which had already been covered by Cher on her \"Heart of Stone\" album) cracked the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. He also played a cameo role as a forklift driver in Wes Craven's \"Shocker\".\n\nRoberts is notable for his Rambo-like appearance and physique and his usage of an electric guitar shaped like a machine gun.\n\nRoberts was the guitarist who played on Alice Cooper's \"Constrictor\" and \"Raise Your Fist and Yell\" and their respective tours. He is the man responsible for Alice's metal years in the late 1980s, as he co-wrote nearly every track from those albums. Just by being on stage, he was a part of the show with his huge physique and rocket shooting guitars.\n\nAfter \"Raise Your Fist\", Roberts released his first solo album, \"Kane Roberts\", which featured Cooper's lyrics on \"Full Pull.\" He then guested on Cooper's 1989 \"Trash\" album, playing guitar on \"Bed of Nails,\" which he co-wrote. Two years later, he released a second solo album, \"Saints and Sinners\", which contained the Bon Jovi-penned \"Does Anybody Really Fall in Love Anymore?\", previously recorded by Cher as well.\n\nWhile he is primarily a guitar player, Roberts is also a skilled vocalist, capable of extreme high range, as is evident on his solo projects. He has contributed backing vocals on several albums, including Steve Vai's \"Sex & Religion\", Desmond Child's \"Discipline\", and the song \"Shocker\" by the Dudes of Wrath, which served as the title track from the \"1989 film of the same name\".\n\nHis additional musical contributions include playing on the Bob Ezrin-produced \"Count Three & Pray\" album by Berlin, and the 1986 Rod Stewart album \"Every Beat of My Heart\". He also co-wrote \"Take It Off\" with Paul Stanley and Bob Ezrin, which appeared on Kiss' \"Revenge\" album.\n\nRoberts took a long hiatus from music after his second solo album, but returned in 1999 with a band called Phoenix Down, named for a life potion in the video game franchise \"Final Fantasy\". Phoenix Down recorded two albums, entitled \"Under A Wild Sky\" and \"New Place Now\". Fans of both say that much of the record is inspired by the seventh game in the series, one of Roberts' favorite games.\n\nAfter several years away from the music industry, working in graphic arts and as a video game programmer, Roberts began work on a new album, \"Touched\", in 2006.\n\nOn October 23, 2011, Roberts performed with Talon at Firefest VIII, marking his first live performance in over twenty years. In 2012, Roberts released \"Unsung Radio\", a collection of previously unreleased tracks. In 2016, Roberts featured on a track for the Northern Ireland-based hard rock outfit, Maverick. The track and video (also featuring Kane) for \"Asylum\" also included Jakob Samuel from Sweden's The Poodles.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Roberts released a new solo album, \"The New Normal\", on Frontiers Records.\n\nIn late 2019 it was reported that Kane Roberts is working on his next solo album which was described as being heavier than the previous album.\n\n\n\n"}

The station is situated on the Atlantic Coast Line, measured from . Great Western Railway manage the station and operates all the trains that call.\n\nThe first railway at Luxulyan was a horse-worked line from Par Harbour to Molinnis which was built by Joseph Treffry, opening on 18 May 1847. It climbed up the side of the Luxulyan Valley on a cable-worked incline and then crossed it on the Treffry Viaduct.\n\nOn 1 June 1874 a new line was opened by the Cornwall Minerals Railway. Running from Fowey to Newquay, it bypassed the incline, instead passing beneath the Treffry Viaduct and entering Luxulyan through the 50 yard (46m) Luxulyan Tunnel. The tramway was retained from Luxulyan over the Treffry Viaduct to a quarry at Colcerrow until about 1933.\n\nA passenger service was introduced on 20 June 1876 when a station was provided at Bridges, which was renamed \"Luxulyan\" 1 May 1905. The passing loop was lengthened in 1910 and again on 10 May 1936. The two original platforms were replaced by an island platform between the tracks as part of the 1910 alterations. A camping coach was kept in the goods yard for several years for hiring out to tourists who arrived by train.\n\nA new siding to serve the Treskilling China Clay Works was opened in 1916. This survived until 1975 but the public goods yard closed on 27 September 1964, as did the connection to the stub of the Colcerrow branch east of the station. The passing loop and the second platform face were taken out of use at the same time.\n\nThere is a single platform on the east side of the track which has a shelter and seats. At the southern end of this is the car park which connects to a small lane that leads to the village's main road. This lane crosses over the railway on a stone bridge a short distance south of the platform. The station has a solar powered help point which allows waiting people to find out when the next trains will arrive.\n\nLuxulyan is a request stop on the line, so passengers wishing to alight must inform the conductor and passengers wishing to join the train must signal to the driver. The typical service is one train every two hours in each direction between Par and Newquay, with some services extending to Plymouth and one train in the summer extending to Penzance. On summer Saturdays, there is just one train per day in each direction due to the intercity services running through to Newquay in lieu of the local services. Trains are usually operated by Class 150 \"Sprinters.\"\n\nThe trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the \"Atlantic Coast Line\" name.\n\nThe Kings Arms pub in Luxulyan is part of the Atlantic Coast Line rail ale trail.\n\n\n"}

From 1981 to 2009, Drillers Stadium was home to the Tulsa Drillers, of the Double-A Texas League. For a number of years Drillers Stadium also hosted one of the regular season baseball games played between Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma in the Bedlam Series. \nDrillers Stadium is located on the southwest corner of Yale Avenue and 15th Street, in the Tulsa State Fairgrounds complex that also includes Expo Square Pavilion, the QuikTrip Center and Golden Driller, a racetrack, a waterpark, and the sites of the former Bell's Amusement Park and of Oiler Park, where Tulsa's professional baseball teams had played since 1934.\n\nAfter the Tulsa Oilers, a Triple-A team, left Tulsa in 1976 due to the continuing deterioration of Oiler Park, followed by the partial collapse of the Oiler Park grandstand during a 1977 exhibition game, Tulsa County's long-delayed efforts to build a new stadium were accelerated. The new 8,000 seat stadium was completed in 1981 and named Robert B. Sutton Stadium, in honor of its chief benefactor, a local oil executive. However, Sutton was convicted in 1982 on obstruction of justice charges, and the ballpark was renamed Tulsa County Stadium. The stadium received the name Drillers Stadium in 1989. The stadium eventually seated 10,997, making it the largest stadium in Double-A baseball. Originally a multi-purpose stadium with an artificial surface playing field, it later acquired a Prescription Athletic Turf (PAT) grass surface. Though it primarily served as a baseball stadium, monster truck rallies and concerts were also held there.\n\nOn December 19, 2008, construction began on ONEOK Field, a new ballpark in downtown Tulsa. The Drillers played their final game in Drillers Stadium on September 7, 2009, and moved to the new ballpark before the 2010 baseball season. The University of Tulsa conducted a formal study in 2009 to consider whether the school might use the empty stadium to restore its baseball program, which had been terminated in 1980; but the university concluded that the financial demands of adding a new sport were more than it could accept. In 2011 the stadium was used as a location for a faith-themed baseball film entitled \"Home Run\".\n\nBeginning in May 2013, it is the home stadium for the Tulsa Athletics of the National Premier Soccer League. In 2014, the stadium was renamed Athletics Stadium after further renovations were complete to make the stadium more soccer friendly for the Tulsa Athletics. Notable changes include the demolition of the former first-base side bleachers, in order to lengthen the soccer field's length to 110 yards, as well as the removal of Drillers' signage and a coat of green paint.\n\nOn April 5, 2016, Proposition 3 of the Tulsa \"Vision 2025\" initiative was approved by Tulsa voters, paving the way for the demolition of Athletics Stadium as the new site of the USA BMX \"Epicenter\" facility. The stadium was to be replaced by a multimillion-dollar indoor BMX arena, but those plans hit a snag in mid-2017 when a disagreement over soft drink \"pouring rights\" derailed the negotiations and saw the BMX project move to an alternate location on a parcel of city-owned industrial property, northwest of downtown.\n\nAs of March 2019 the stadium and the adjacent offices have been demolished leaving nothing of the former stadium remaining. \n\n"}

In 1981 she bettered her own existing world records in the 100-meter butterfly (57.93) and 200-meter butterfly (2:05.96). These times would stand as the respective world records for 18 and 19 years, and are considered to be among the greatest sports performances ever.\n\nMeagher is the daughter of two-time Notre Dame basketball letterman James L. Meagher. She was a competitive athlete from an early age. At the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico, she set her first world record—at the age of 14—in the 200-meter butterfly. \"When she was a teenager, Mary showed no weaknesses,\" reflected Dennis Pursley, one of her early coaches. \"Every athlete I've ever known had some form of weakness, be it in terms of motivation, technique or physical attributes, but Mary was the exception.\" She graduated from the Sacred Heart Academy high school in Louisville, Kentucky, alongside her sister, future U.S. Representative Anne Northup.\n\nMeagher was expected to compete for medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. However, Meagher, along with the rest of the United States Olympic team, never got her chance due to the American-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics.\n\nHowever, in 1981 Meagher gave one of the most memorable performances in competitive swimming at the U.S. Swimming National Championships held in Brown Deer, Wisconsin in 1981. At the meet, Meagher set world records in both the 200-meter and 100-meter butterfly, the two primary distances at which the butterfly is contested in competitive swimming. The times for both records were considered astonishing, especially the record of 57.93 seconds that Meagher set in the 100-meters—a drop of over a second. Both times would stand as the world records for nearly two decades: American swimmer Jenny Thompson lowered the 100-meter record in 1999, while Susie O'Neill of Australia set the record in the 200-meter a year later. Some have argued that Meagher's records in the butterfly were among the most impressive records ever set in sport, let alone swimming, ranking among such noteworthy records as Bob Beamon's long jump world record in 1968. These two swims led Meagher to being named Female World Swimmer of the Year by \"Swimming World Magazine\", which she again won in 1985.\n\nMeagher attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she swam for the California Golden Bears swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Pacific-10 Conference competition. She received the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving twice, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year in 1984–85 and again in 1986–87. In 1987, she also won the Honda Broderick Cup as the nation's top female collegiate athlete. She graduated from the University of California in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in social sciences.\n\nAt the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Meagher won gold medals in both the 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly races, along with another gold by swimming the butterfly leg of the women's 4×100-meter medley relay for the winning U.S. team in the event final. Returning to compete at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Meagher won a bronze medal in the 200-meter butterfly. By the time she left competitive swimming, Meagher had won 24 U.S. national swimming titles.\n\nMeagher was the 10th of 11 siblings. She married former speed skater Mike Plant. They now live in Peachtree City, Georgia, with their two children, Maddie and Drew. Mike Plant's brother and Meagher's brother-in-law, Tom Plant, was also a speed skater and Olympian. Meagher's older sister Anne Meagher Northup served as a US Congresswoman.\n\nIn Louisville a swimming complex is named for Meagher, and a street is named in her honor in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

The term \"optics\" is used because magnetic and electrostatic lenses act upon a charged particle beam similarly to optical lenses upon a light beam.\n\nElectron optics calculations are crucial for the design of electron microscopes and particle accelerators. In the paraxial approximation, trajectory calculations can be carried out using ray transfer matrix analysis.\n\nElectrons are charged particles (point charges with rest mass) with spin 1/2 (hence they are fermions). Electrons can be accelerated by suitable electric (or magnetic) fields, thereby acquiring kinetic energy. Given sufficient voltage, the electron can be accelerated sufficiently fast to exhibit measurable relativistic effects. According to wave particle duality, electrons can also be considered as matter waves with properties such as wavelength, phase and amplitude.\n\nElectrons interact with magnetic fields according to the second term of the Lorentz force: a cross product between the magnetic field and the electron velocity. In an infinite uniform field this results in a circular motion of the electron around the field direction with a radius given by:\n\nwhere \"r\" is the orbit radius, \"m\" is the mass of an electron, formula_2is the component of the electron velocity perpendicular to the field, \"e\" is the electron charge and \"B\" is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field. Electrons that have a velocity component parallel to the magnetic field will proceed along helical trajectories.\nIn the case of an applied electrostatic field, an electron will deflect towards the positive gradient of the field. Notably, this crossing of electrostatic field lines means that electrons, as they move through electrostatic fields change the magnitude of their velocity, whereas in magnetic fields, only the velocity direction is modified.\n\nAs electrons can exhibit non-particle (wave-like) effects such as diffraction, a full analysis of electron paths can be obtained by solving Maxwell's equation—however in many situations, the particle interpretation may provide a sufficient approximation with great reduction in complexity.\n\nOne further property of electrons is that they interact strongly with matter as they are sensitive to not only the nucleus, but also the matter's electron charge cloud. Therefore, electrons require vacuum to propagate any reasonable distance, such as would be desirable in electron optic system.\n\nPenetration in vacuum is dictated by mean free path, a measure of the probability of collision between electrons and matter, approximate values for which can be derived from Poisson statistics.\n\nAlthough not very common, it is also possible to derive effects of magnetic structures to charged particles starting from the Dirac equation.\n\nA sub-relativistic free electron propagating in vacuum can be accurately described as a de Broglie matter wave with a wavelength inversely proportional to its longitudinal momentum. As a result of the charge carried by the electron, electric fields, magnetic fields, or the electrostatic mean inner potential of thin, weakly interacting materials can impart a phase shift to the wavefront of an electron. Thickness-modulated silicon nitride membranes and programmable phase shift devices have exploited these properties to apply spatially varying phase shifts to control the far-field spatial intensity and phase of the electron wave. Devices like these have been applied to arbitrarily shape the electron wavefront, correct the aberrations inherent to electron microscopes, resolve the orbital angular momentum of a free electron, and to measure dichroism in the interaction between free electrons and magnetic materials or plasmonic nanostructures.\n\n\n"}

It was formed in March 1983 in Warsaw by two well-known Polish underground musicians: Robert Brylewski (formerly of Brygada Kryzys) and Paweł Kelner (formerly of Deuter).\n\nAccording to Brylewski, \"Izrael's creation was a consequence of the death of Brygada Kryzys. During last rehearsals of Brygada Kryzys only three musicians were present: Kelner, me and Tomasz Lipinski. There was nobody else. It was the end of 1982, hard times for Polish independent rockers. At some point Tomasz put his guitar on the side and said \"I quit.\"\n\nIzrael's debut took place on April 25, 1983, in the Hybrydy student club in Warsaw, where the band rehearsed. The first recording, \"Idą ludzie Babilonu,\" was made later that year and quickly gained popularity. The band started to play in numerous concerts (such as at the Festival in Jarocin, and a series of concerts called \"God's Music in Babylon\"). It also supported the group Misty in Roots when they came to Poland.\n\nIn May 1983, the first LP, \"Biada, biada biada\", was recorded, but it was not delivered to stores until many months later.\n\nIn 1986, Kelner decided to quit and was replaced by Darek \"Maleo\" Malejonek (formerly of Kultura), with whom the second album, \"Nabij faję\", was recorded. At that time, Izrael's musicians decided to accept any person who would like to play with them and who would bring something creative. Several musicians therefore became members of Izrael, including jazzmen, which was unusual for a reggae band. Altogether, approximately 100 musicians have been members of Izrael at one time or another. In 1987, the third album, \"Duchowa Rewolucja\", was recorded.\n\nAround the year 1989, Izrael became an established band with Brylewski, Vivian Brylewska (Robert's wife), Maleo, Piotr \"Stopa\" Żyżelewicz and Alik Dziki. In the same year, the band went on a tour to then-Communist Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, Wlodzimierz Kiniorski joined as a new member. He played several instruments, including the saxophone and the flute.\n\nIn 1990, the band went to Great Britain on an invitation from Marcin Miller. There they played several concerts and, more importantly, recorded an LP, \"1991\", which is regarded as one of the best albums in the history of Polish music. \"1991\" was recorded at a \"Ariwa Sounds,\" a studio owned by Mad Professor.\n\nAfter their return to Poland, Izrael played numerous concerts and the band was enthusiastically embraced by fans. In 1994, the concert album \"Live 93\" was issued, which included songs recorded live in Kraków and Białystok. The band was at the height of its popularity, thinking about a new LP. In 1995, the band was suddenly disbanded. According to Brylewski, \"[the band's] history was fulfilled\", since it was not created to sell records and make money.\n\nIn 1997, Brylewski released the album \"In Dub\"—a dubbed mix of the band's best songs. In 2006, the band, temporarily known as Magnetosfera, played a few concerts. Izrael returned in 2007 and reportedly is preparing a new album.\n\n"}

It has an average elevation of with a width of . The pass is located between the Nilgiri Hills to the north and Anaimalai Hills to the south.\n\nThere are various theories about the origin of Palakkad gap. One among them is that it is caused by the landslide due to rivers flowing in opposite directions. The Bharatha Puzha river originates in the Palakkad Gap from rivulets and tributaries feeding from steep escarpment slopes along the flanks of the Ghats.\n\nPalakkad gap has played a major role in enabling human migration into Kerala from parts of Tamil Nadu. From 300 B.C. to 13th century, it also helped the Cheras rule the entire Kerala and the Kongu Nadu as one geographical unit from Karur in Western Tamil Nadu. Tamil Brahmins migrated to Palakkad from Central Tamil Nadu via the Palakkad gap from the 15th century to 18th century.\n\nThe gap affects the weather patterns in Southern India as it allows the moisture-laden Southwest monsoon winds into western Tamil Nadu, moderating summer temperatures and generating greater rainfall in the region relative to the rest of lowland Tamil Nadu. It also allows the hot winds coming from Tamil Nadu which warm the eastern part of Kerala compared to the rest of the state and the tropical cyclone winds from Bay of Bengal bearing rain during the summer.\n\nThe gap is the lowest pass through the Western Ghats in the region. It is an important mountain pass in the Western Ghats that runs along the entire eastern edge of Kerala isolating it from the neighboring Tamil Nadu. It acts as an important transport corridor between the two States by linking Palakkad District of Kerala with Coimbatore District of Tamil Nadu and has served as a vital trade route between the east and west coasts of peninsular India since ancient times.\n\nBoth the National Highway 544 and the Coimbatore - Shoranur railway line joining Kerala to Tamil Nadu pass through the gap. The gap also helps for VHF line of sight communications between the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe Palakkad Gap funnels the winds blowing from the west on to Coimbatore and Tirupur districts in Tamil Nadu making the region one of the major wind power generation areas. The average annual wind speed is 18–22 km/hr. Large windmill farms can be seen in and around Udumalaipettai and Kadathur.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2220978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220978", "title": "Laborers' International Union of North America", "text": "Laborers' International Union of North America\n\nThe Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA, often shortened to just the Laborers' Union) is an American and Canadian labor union formed in 1903. As of 2017, they had about 500,000 members, about 80,000 of whom are in Canada. The current general president is Terence M. O'Sullivan who was appointed general president in 2000, elected by delegates in 2001, and re-elected in 2006. There are nine regions across North America; these regions are further divided into 500 local unions. One region is in Toronto Canada and is led by Joseph Mancinelli, Local 183, which is the largest construction local union in North America.\n\nLIUNA’s origins stretch back to the 19th century when local construction unions began popping up across the United States. Then, in March 1903, Samuel Gompers, the President of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), successfully persuaded various local construction unions from across the U.S. to unite in order to consolidate power in their fight against unfair labor practices.\n\nAs a result, on April 13, 1903, the International Hod Carriers and Building Laborers’ Union (IHC and BLC) was established at its founding convention in Washington D.C. At the convention there were 25 delegates from 23 unions in 17 different cities in attendance. During the course of the convention the delegates elected a General President, Herman Lilien, a General Secretary-Treasurer, Harold Stemburgh, and adopted a Declaration of Principles. Also, the delegates were able to produce the union's first charter, which claimed jurisdiction over:\n\n\"Wrecking of buildings, excavations of buildings, digging of trenches, piers and foundations, holes, digging, lagging, sheeting of said foundations, holes, and caisson work, concrete for buildings, whether foundations, floors or any other, whether done by hand or any other process, tending to masons, mixing and handling all materials used by masons (except stone setters), building of centers for fireproofing purposes, tending to carpenters, tending to and mixing of all materials for plastering, whether done by hand or any other process, clearing of debris from buildings, shoring, underpin- ning and raising of old buildings, drying of plastering, when done by sala- mander heat, handling of dimension stones.\"\n\nNine years later, in 1912, the IHC and BLC experiences two name changes. First, in September, the union’s name was changed to the International Hod Carriers and Common Laborers of America. Then, in December, the name was changed again to the International Hod Carriers' Building and Common Laborers of America.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the union achieved considerable wage raises for members in Pittsburgh, New York City, New York and Chicago, and orchestrated strikes in Boston, St. Louis and Philadelphia. By 1920, membership had climbed to 96,000. The union backed calls by African American workers to be allowed full and equal status as union members, denying permission for segregated unions to be founded in Kansas City and Cincinnati.\n\nIn 1929, the union expanded to include the Tunnel and Subway Contractors’ International Union. Then, eight years later, the union expanded again to include the Pavers' International Union. However, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, membership fell to under 30,000 as more and more people lost their jobs.\n\nIn 1940, the union moved its international headquarters from Massachusetts to Washington D.C. Also, in October of that year, union dues were suspended in support of the U.S.’s impending involvement in WWII.\n\nBy 1942, despite the decline in union membership during the early years of the Great Depression, membership climbed back up to more than 400,000 - over half of which left their jobs to serve in World War II. In September 1946, at the general convention in Chicago, the union created a monthly journal called \"The Laborer\". However, the first issue of \"The Laborer\" was not published until June 1947. A few months later, in September, the union signed its first national pipeline agreement, which protected wages, benefits, and safety conditions for pipeline workers.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the union made significant gains concerning health and welfare benefits. For example, in 1956, laborers in Pittsburg were able to form pension plans. Also, in 1955, the union helped establish the National Joint Heavy and Highway Construction Committee. The purpose of the committee was to ensure that union members could take advantage of the jobs created by the Interstate Highway Act of 1954.\n\nIn 1962, the Laborers met with President John F. Kennedy at the White House to pledge not to discriminate when hiring. Later, after President Kennedy was assassinated, the union went back to the White House yet again, this time to pledge support for President Lyndon Johnson’s \"War on Poverty.\" Union members even participated in Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington in 1963. In 1965, the union was renamed the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA). A year later, LIUNA created the Laborers’ Political League in order to both influence politics and encourage its members to participate in the political process. In 1968, the union expanded to include over 60,000 new workers from the National Association of Post Office Mail Handlers, Watchmen, Messengers and Group Leaders. Also, the Journeyman Stone Cutters Association of North America joined with the union as well.\n\nDuring the 1970s, LIUNA continued to push for improved education and training for its workers despite a slowdown in construction projects. For instance, in 1971, LIUNA’s Laborers – Associated General Contractors Fund completed a film and held its first national training conference. In addition, LIUNA helped hospital workers organize under the AFL-CIO’s Public Employee Department in 1974. Also in that year, LIUNA signed a national agreement with Bricklayers and Masonry contractors. In 1976, LIUNA began training women to work in construction with funds from the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. Other notable achievements for LIUNA during the 1970s were newly established pension plans in central and southern states, legal services for members of Louisiana local 229, and a vision center for members in Massachusetts.\n\nThe 1980s were tough times for labor in general due to President Ronald Reagan’s tough stance on unions. However, there were some successes for LIUNA. In 1981, LIUNA locals in New York sought to improve their benefits by offering drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. Also, in that same year, LIUNA created the New England Laborers’ Training Academy (NELTA). The purpose of NELTA was to spread awareness of the dangers of asbestos and teach union members how to safely remove it. Then, just six years later, LIUNA signed a national agreement with the Asbestos Abatement Contractors Association insuring safer working conditions for all its members. Two years prior to that, the union won another significant victory when the Department of Labor formally recognized highway flaggers as members of LIUNA. This was important because it gave the highway flaggers better protection for their wages. In 1988, LIUNA established the Laborers’ Health and Safety Fund of North America, which was a co-venture between labor and management to help improved health and safety for workers. One year later, LIUNA locals in Baltimore and Washington D.C. followed the example set by New York unions and instituted drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. These programs have since been expanded to unions across the rest of America.\n\nDuring the 1990s, LIUNA experienced a number of new organizing initiatives to improve and expand the union. By 1994, the United States Department of Labor had recognized construction as an apprenticeable occupation, which allowed LIUNA to establish its own apprenticeship program. In 1998, LIUNA created its Public Employee Department. As a result, LIUNA added approximately 5,200 Riverside, Ca. County workers along members of the Canadian Licensed Practical Nurses Association.\n\nBranches of the LIUNA were found to have been infiltrated by organized crime in the 1990s. In one particular case, the Buffalo, New York wing of the Italian mafia controlled Local 210 of the LIUNA for decades. A protracted investigation into the union's operations over the course of a decade eventually drove the crime family out of the union by 2006.\n\nIn 2001, members of the LIUNA participated in the clean up at Ground Zero in New York following the September 11 terrorist attacks. In 2003, the same year the Laborers' Union celebrated its 100th anniversary, it also spearheaded the creation of its first construction charter school. The Cranston Public Schools Construction and Career Academy is a high school that teaches students about the construction industry and how to get into it. At the 2011 convention, LIUNA passed several resolutions to help invest in political activism through the organization’s Political Action Committee (PAC).\n\nOn June 1, 2006, O'Sullivan announced that LIUNA had disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO and joined the Change to Win Federation. However, LIUNA officials said on August 13, 2010, that the union would leave Change to Win and rejoin the AFL-CIO in October 2010.\n\nIn May 2016, in the midst of the 2016 United States presidential election, LIUNA donated US$1 million to Priorities USA Action, a SuperPAC which supports Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to LIUNA's Department of Labor records since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, the union's membership has been in a slow decline across all categories except \"retired\" members, which reports a slight increase during the period. The most drastic decline, by over half, has been in \"mail handlers associate\" members, which is the second largest category of members and the only category reported as ineligible to vote in the union. LIUNA contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which since 2006 have numbered comparatively less than 1% of the size of the union's membership. Agency fee payers have also fallen by about half of its reported number, although comparatively marginal throughout. As of 2013 this accounts for about 90,000 \"mail handler associates\" (16%), 68,000 \"retirees\" (12%) and 38,000 \"mail handler regulars\" (7%), plus less than 2,000 non-members paying agency fees, compared to about 362,000 \"regular\" members (65%).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2220986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220986", "title": "Shinya Hashimoto", "text": "Shinya Hashimoto\n\nHe is one of three wrestlers (the others being Keiji Mutoh and Satoshi Kojima) that have held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. He is often compared to All Japan Pro Wrestling's (AJPW) Toshiaki Kawada, as both are widely known for their stiff kicks and violent matches.\n\nHashimoto grew up in Toki City in Gifu, and began training in judo and karate in his late teens. His training helped him in his transition to professional wrestling, as he joined the NJPW Dojo in April 1984. He made his debut for NJPW in September 1984 at the age of 19, wrestling against Tatsutoshi Goto. Hashimoto worked on becoming a skilled wrestler over the next few years, travelling whenever necessary to gain more seasoning, such as over in the United States (Continental Wrestling Association), Canada (Stampede Wrestling), and Puerto Rico (World Wrestling Council).\n\nIt was in Puerto Rico in 1988 that Hashimoto formed The Three Musketeers with Masahiro Chono and Keiji Mutoh.\n\nUpon Hashimoto's return to New Japan in July 1988, he started to climb his way up the NJPW ladder. By this time, he introduced a martial artist gimmick based on his own background, which he represented by wearing a hachimaki during his ring entrances and utilizing a wrestling style based on shoot kicks, karate strikes and submission holds. In April 1989, he took part in the IWGP Heavyweight Championship tournament at New Japan's first show in the Tokyo Dome, Battle Satellite in Tokyo Dome he defeated Riki Choshu and Victor Zangiev, before losing to Big Van Vader in the finals. In September 1989, Hashimoto teamed with Masa Saito to win his first gold, the IWGP Tag Team Championship, beating Choshu and Takayuki Iizuka. The two held the belts until the next year, losing in April 1990 to two other up-and-comers: Masahiro Chono and Keiji Mutoh.\n\nIn August 1991, Hashimoto, Chono, and Mutoh cemented their status as the aces of NJPW during the G1 Climax, surpassing longtime aces Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Riki Choshu. In July 1992, he replaced an injured Akira Nogami to team with Hiroshi Hase to participate in the NWA World Tag Team Championship tournament held by World Championship Wrestling and they defeated The Fabulous Freebirds in the quarterfinals, before losing to Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham in the semi-finals. Hashimoto finally hit the big time in 1993, as he won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from the Great Muta in September. Hashimoto held the biggest belt in NJPW for the next seven months before being taken down by the legendary Tatsumi Fujinami. Hashimoto regained the gold only a month later, in May 1994. For the next year, Hashimoto stayed a dominating force in New Japan, defeating challenger after challenger. In fact, Hashimoto reigned as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion for over a year, losing the belt to Mutoh only two days after celebrating the milestone.\n\nA few months after losing the gold, Hashimoto teamed up with Junji Hirata in July 1995 to face and defeat Scott Norton and Mike Enos to win the vacated IWGP Tag Team Championship, making Hashimoto a two-time champion in both divisions. Soon, Hashimoto enjoyed another lengthy championship run, as he and Hirata remained the champions for almost another year. Hashimoto also became a double champion, as he defeated Nobuhiko Takada to regain the IWGP Heavyweight Title on April 29, 1996. Hashimoto and Hirata lost the tag title in June 1996, when they fell to Takashi Iizuka and Kazuo Yamazaki. Hashimoto soldiered on to focus solely on the singles gold, as he worked on another lengthy run. In 1997, he was presented with a new championship belt (the second-generation IWGP Heavyweight Championship). On August 31, 1997, Hashimoto lost the title to Kensuke Sasaki, after reigning as champion for a record-breaking 489 days (the record has since been broken by Kazuchika Okada in 2017). Hashimoto continued to work for NJPW for the next few years, earning another great honor by winning the G1 Climax in 1998.\n\nHashimoto launched into a brutal rivalry against Judo champion Naoya Ogawa in 1997, leading to Hashimoto vowing to retire from NJPW if he lost again, which happened in April 2000. He stayed at New Japan for the New Japan/All Japan \"Do Judge!\" card on October 9, where he defeated Tatsumi Fujinami by submission, and also appeared at the \"Great Voyage 2000\" event for Pro Wrestling Noah on December 23, where he defeated Takao Omori, but he later left NJPW as promised.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1998, Hashimoto took part in various worked mixed martial arts-like bouts in NJPW, called \"Different Style Fights\", where he defeated the likes of Tony Halme, Ramzin Shibiev and Dennis Lane. Most of the bouts lasted from 3 to 14 minutes and usually ended via submission or knockout.\n\nDue to its success at this field, Hashimoto was scouted by K-1 executive Kazuyoshi Ishii to compete in their '93 GP tournament, but he declined. He was also invited to a 1994 all-star shoot wrestling tournament in Union of Wrestling Forces International, NJPW's rival promotion, in which the winner would receive a hundred million yen prize, but he refused again.\n\nHashimoto registered the Pro Wrestling Zero-One name on November 13, 2000, after being fired from New Japan Pro Wrestling, and the promotion had its first show on March 2, 2001. Hashimoto challenged Steve Corino for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in October 2001. The match ended in controversy, leading to the belt being vacated. In December 2001, Hashimoto faced off against Corino and Gary Steele in a Triple Threat Match, winning the vacated NWA World Heavyweight Title. Hashimoto's NWA World Title reign would come to an end in March 2002 through duplicitous means, as a crooked referee gave a fast count, allowing Dan Severn to win the title. Hashimoto then went back to concentrating on Zero-One, where he was an active competitor. In October 2002, Hashimoto teamed with his old rival, Naoya Ogawa, to win the NWA Intercontinental Tag-Team Title (which were usually defended in Zero-One) from John Heidenreich and Nathan Jones. The two defended the championship for the next few months, before falling to Matt Ghaffari and Tom Howard in December 2002. The two teams feuded on and off over the next few months, even as Hashimoto looked to another organization for a major accomplishment.\nOn February 23, 2003, Hashimoto defeated the Great Muta to win the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship; as a result, Hashimoto became only the second man to have held the NJPW, AJPW, and NWA World Titles (as Keiji Mutoh was the first). Hashimoto and Ogawa won back the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Title from Ghaffari and Howard in April 2003. However, due to Ogaya having thrown Ghaffari over the top rope at one point in the match, NWA President Richard Arpin stripped them of the championship a few days later, as throwing an opponent over the top rope is against the rules in the NWA. Hashimoto's Triple Crown would face a similar fate, as Hashimoto suffered a knee injury in August 2003 and had to vacate the belt.\n\nDespite the build-up of several injuries, Hashimoto continued to wrestle on and off in Zero-One, including teaming with Yoshiaki Fujiwara to get the NWA Intercontinental Tag-Team Titles for a third time, defeating Takao Omori and Shiro Koshinaka in June 2004. The two remained the champions until before Omori found a new partner in Shinjiro Otani to win the championship in August 2004. Going into 2005, Hashimoto left Zero-One and placed Otani in charge, citing financial problems as the reason for his departure.\n\nHashimoto had a son, Daichi Hashimoto, who made his pro wrestling debut for the Zero1 promotion at their 10th Anniversary Show on March 6, 2011, facing Masahiro Chono in a losing effort. He also left behind two young daughters.\n\nHashimoto suddenly died of a brain aneurism on July 11, 2005; he was pronounced dead at 10:36 a.m. while en route to the hospital. Hashimoto's sister Masanari claimed that Hashimoto had been complaining about chest pains and thought that his heart was beating too fast a week prior to his death, but refused to contact his doctor about the conditions. Hashimoto had a heart problem in 2004 and was put on medicine, but he had to stop taking it after having shoulder surgery. Hashimoto's doctor claimed that high blood pressure was the most likely cause for his brain hemorrhage and proposed that other stress over the years led to these problems.\n\nIn the years following Hashimoto's death, numerous wrestlers and promotions have paid tribute to him. Immediately following his death, New Japan retired the second IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt as Hashimoto was the first to wear it. A third IWGP Title belt was created and debuted in October 2005 but New Japan lost it in July 2006 when Brock Lesnar left New Japan and took the belt with him which forced New Japan to bring the second belt back. After regaining the third belt in February 2008 and the creation of the fourth IWGP Title belt, the second was retired once again. On March 2, 2008, then IWGP Heavyweight Champion: Shinsuke Nakamura visited ZERO1 for their anniversary show where he defeated Kohei Sato. After the match, he gave the second IWGP Title belt to Hashimoto's son, Daichi.\n\nIn August 2005, Masahiro Chono used Hashimoto's Bakusho Sengen theme during the final match of the 2005 G1 Climax. At PRIDE Shockwave 2005, Naoya Ogawa wore Hashimoto's signature headband and came out to Bakusho Sengen for his fight against Hidehiko Yoshida. In late 2005, Hashimoto was posthumously awarded an achievement award by Tokyo Sports. At Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome on January 4, 2007, Chono and Mutoh paid tribute after defeating Tencozy as they wore Hashimoto's headbands while his theme song played. On September 21, 2009, ZERO1 held the \"Shinya Hashimoto 25th Anniversary Destructive King Legend In Korakuen Hall\" show which celebrated Hashimoto's would be 25th anniversary. In 2010, Hashimoto was inducted into both New Japan's Greatest Wrestlers Hall of Fame and the NWA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221011", "title": "Platonism", "text": "Platonism\n\nPlatonism is the philosophy of Plato and philosophical systems closely derived from it, though contemporary platonists do not necessarily accept all of the doctrines of Plato. Platonism had a profound effect on Western thought. Platonism at least affirms the existence of abstract objects, which are asserted to exist in a third realm distinct from both the sensible external world and from the internal world of consciousness, and is the opposite of nominalism. This can apply to properties, types, propositions, meanings, numbers, sets, truth values, and so on (see abstract object theory). Philosophers who affirm the existence of abstract objects are sometimes called platonists; those who deny their existence are sometimes called nominalists. The terms \"platonism\" and \"nominalism\" also have established senses in the history of philosophy, where they denote positions that have little to do with the modern notion of an abstract object. \n\nIn a narrower sense, the term might indicate the doctrine of Platonic realism. The central concept of Platonism, a distinction essential to the Theory of Forms, is the distinction between the reality which is perceptible but unintelligible, associated with the flux of Heraclitus and studied by the likes of science, and the reality which is imperceptible but intelligible, associated with the unchanging being of Parmenides and studied by the likes of mathematics. Geometry was a main motivation of Plato, and this also shows the influence of Pythagoras. The Forms are typically described in dialogues such as the \"Phaedo\", \"Symposium\" and \"Republic\" as perfect archetypes of which objects in the everyday world are imperfect copies. Aristotle's Third Man Argument is its most famous criticism in antiquity. \n\nIn the \"Republic\" the highest form is identified as the Form of the Good, the source of all other Forms, which could be known by reason. In the \"Sophist\", a later work, the Forms \"being\", \"sameness\" and \"difference\" are listed among the primordial \"Great Kinds\". Plato established the Academy, and in the 3rd century BC, Arcesilaus adopted academic skepticism, which became a central tenet of the school until 90 BC when Antiochus added Stoic elements, rejected skepticism, and began a period known as Middle Platonism. \n\nIn the 3rd century AD, Plotinus added mystical elements, establishing Neoplatonism, in which the summit of existence was the One or the Good, the source of all things; in virtue and meditation the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One. Many Platonic notions were adopted by the Christian church which understood Plato's Forms as God's thoughts (a position also known as divine conceptualism), while Neoplatonism became a major influence on Christian mysticism in the West through Saint Augustine, Doctor of the Catholic Church, who was heavily influenced by Plotinus' \"Enneads\", and in turn were foundations for the whole of Western Christian thought. Many ideas of Plato were incorporated by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe primary concept is the Theory of Forms. The only true being is founded upon the forms, the eternal, unchangeable, perfect types, of which particular objects of moral and responsible sense are imperfect copies. The multitude of objects of sense, being involved in perpetual change, are thereby deprived of all genuine existence. The number of the forms is defined by the number of universal concepts which can be derived from the particular objects of sense. The following excerpt may be representative of Plato's middle period metaphysics and epistemology:\n\n[Socrates:] \"Since the beautiful is opposite of the ugly, they are two.\"<br>\n[Glaucon:] \"Of course.\"<br>\n\"And since they are two, each is one?\"<br>\n\"I grant that also.\"<br>\n\"And the same account is true of the just and unjust, the good and the bad, and all the forms. Each of them is itself one, but because they manifest themselves everywhere in association with actions, bodies, and one another, each of them appears to be many.\"<br>\n\"That's right.\"<br>\n\"So, I draw this distinction: On one side are those you just now called lovers of sights, lovers of crafts, and practical people; on the other side are those we are now arguing about and whom one would alone call philosophers.\"<br>\n\"How do you mean?\"<br>\n\"The lovers of sights and sounds like beautiful sounds, colors, shapes, and everything fashioned out of them, but their thought is unable to see and embrace the nature of the beautiful itself.\"<br>\n\"That's for sure.\"<br>\n\"In fact, there are very few people who would be able to reach the beautiful itself and see it by itself. Isn't that so?\"<br>\n\"Certainly.\"<br>\n\"What about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe in the beautiful itself and isn't able to follow anyone who could lead him to the knowledge of it? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than a wakened state? Isn't this dreaming: whether asleep or awake, to think that a likeness is not a likeness but rather the thing itself that it is like?\"<br>\n\"I certainly think that someone who does that is dreaming.\"<br>\n\"But someone who, to take the opposite case, believes in the beautiful itself, can see both it and the things that participate in it and doesn't believe that the participants are it or that it itself is the participants--is he living in a dream or is he awake?<br>\n\"He's very much awake.\"<br>\n\nBook VI of the \"Republic\" identifies the highest form as the Form of the Good, the cause of all other Ideas, and that on which the being and knowing of all other Forms is contingent. Conceptions derived from the impressions of sense can never give us the knowledge of true being; i.e. of the forms. It can only be obtained by the soul's activity within itself, apart from the troubles and disturbances of sense; that is to say, by the exercise of reason. Dialectic, as the instrument in this process, leading us to knowledge of the forms, and finally to the highest form of the Good, is the first of sciences. Later Neoplatonism, beginning with Plotinus, identified the Good of the \"Republic\" with the so-called transcendent, absolute One of the first hypothesis of the \"Parmenides\" (137c-142a).\n\nPlatonist ethics is based on the Form of the Good. Virtue is knowledge, the recognition of the supreme form of the good. And, since in this cognition, the three parts of the soul, which are reason, spirit, and appetite, all have their share, we get the three virtues, Wisdom, Courage, and Moderation. The bond which unites the other virtues is the virtue of Justice, by which each part of the soul is confined to the performance of its proper function.\n\nPlatonism had a profound effect on Western thought. In many interpretations of the \"Timaeus\" Platonism, like Aristotelianism, poses an eternal universe, as opposed to the nearby Judaic tradition that the universe had been created in historical time, with its continuous history recorded. Unlike Aristotelianism, Platonism describes idea as prior to matter and identifies the person with the soul. Many Platonic notions secured a permanent place in Christianity.\n\nPlatonism was originally expressed in the dialogues of Plato, in which the figure of Socrates is used to expound certain doctrines, that may or may not be similar to the thought of the historical Socrates, Plato's master. Plato delivered his lectures at the Academy, a precinct containing a sacred grove outside the walls of Athens. The school continued there long after Plato's death. There were three periods: the Old, Middle, and New Academy. The chief figures in the Old Academy were Speusippus (Plato's nephew), who succeeded him as the head of the school (until 339 BC), and Xenocrates (until 313 BC). Both of them sought to fuse Pythagorean speculations on number with Plato's theory of forms.\n\nAround 266 BC, Arcesilaus became head of the Academy. This phase, known as the Middle Academy, strongly emphasized philosophical skepticism. It was characterized by its attacks on the Stoics and their assertion of the certainty of truth and our knowledge of it. The New Academy began with Carneades in 155 BC, the fourth head in succession from Arcesilaus. It was still largely skeptical, denying the possibility of knowing an absolute truth; both Arcesilaus and Carneades argued that they were maintaining a genuine tenet of Plato.\n\nAround 90 BC, Antiochus of Ascalon rejected skepticism, making way for the period known as Middle Platonism, in which Platonism was fused with certain Peripatetic and many Stoic dogmas. In Middle Platonism, the Platonic Forms were not transcendent but immanent to rational minds, and the physical world was a living, ensouled being, the World-Soul. Pre-eminence in this period belongs to Plutarch. The eclectic nature of Platonism during this time is shown by its incorporation into Pythagoreanism (Numenius of Apamea) and into Jewish philosophy (Philo of Alexandria).\n\nIn the third century, Plotinus recast Plato's system, establishing Neoplatonism, in which Middle Platonism was fused with mysticism. At the summit of existence stands the One or the Good, as the source of all things. It generates from itself, as if from the reflection of its own being, reason, the \"nous\", wherein is contained the infinite store of ideas. The world-soul, the copy of the \"nous\", is generated by and contained in it, as the \"nous\" is in the One, and, by informing matter in itself nonexistent, constitutes bodies whose existence is contained in the world-soul. Nature therefore is a whole, endowed with life and soul. Soul, being chained to matter, longs to escape from the bondage of the body and return to its original source. In virtue and philosophical thought it has the power to elevate itself above the reason into a state of ecstasy, where it can behold, or ascend to, that one good primary Being whom reason cannot know. To attain this union with the Good, or God, is the true function of human beings.\n\nPlotinus' disciple, Porphyry, followed by Iamblichus, developed the system in conscious opposition to Christianity. The Platonic Academy was re-established during this period; its most renowned head was Proclus (died 485), a celebrated commentator on Plato's writings. The Academy persisted until Roman emperor Justinian closed it in 529.\n\nPlatonism has had some influence on Christianity through Clement of Alexandria and Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers. St. Augustine was heavily influenced by Platonism as well, which he encountered through the Latin translations of Marius Victorinus of the works of Porphyry and/or Plotinus.\n\nPlatonism was considered authoritative in the Middle Ages. Platonism also influenced both Eastern and Western mysticism. Meanwhile, Platonism influenced various philosophers. While Aristotle became more influential than Plato in the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas's philosophy was still in certain respects fundamentally Platonic.\n\nThe Renaissance also saw a renewed interest in Platonic thought, including more interest in Plato himself. In 16th-, 17th-, and 19th-century England, Plato's ideas influenced many religious thinkers including the Cambridge Platonists. Orthodox Protestantism in continental Europe, however, distrusts natural reason and has often been critical of Platonism.\nAn issue in the reception of Plato in early modern Europe was how to deal with the same-sex elements of his corpus.\n\n\"Christoplatonism\" is a term used to refer to a dualism opined by Plato, which holds spirit is good but matter is evil, which influenced some christian churches, though the Bible's teaching directly contradicts this philosophy and thus it receives constant criticism from many teachers in the Christian Church today. According to the Methodist Church, \"Christoplatonism\" directly \"contradicts the Biblical record of God calling everything He created good.\"\n\nApart from historical Platonism originating from thinkers such as Plato and Plotinus, we also encounter the theory of abstract objects in the modern sense.\n\nPlatonism is the view that there exist such things as abstract objects — where an abstract object is an object that does not exist in space or time and which is therefore entirely non-physical and non-mental. Platonism in this sense is a contemporary view.\n\nThis modern Platonism has been endorsed in one way or another at one time or another by numerous philosophers, such as Bernard Bolzano, who argue for anti-psychologism. \n\nIn contemporary philosophy, most platonists trace their ideas to Gottlob Frege's influential paper \"Thought,\" which argues for platonism with respect to propositions, and his influential book, \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\", which argues for platonism with respect to numbers and is a seminal text of the logicist project. Contemporary analytic philosophers who espoused Platonism in metaphysics include Bertrand Russell, Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel, W. V. O. Quine, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, and Edward Zalta. Iris Murdoch espoused Platonism in moral philosophy in her 1970 book \"The Sovereignty of Good\". \n\nPaul Benacerraf's epistemological challenge to contemporary platonism has proved its most influential criticism.\n\nIn contemporary Continental philosophy, Edmund Husserl's arguments against psychologism are believed to derive from a Platonist conception of logic, influenced by Frege and his mentor Bolzano.—Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, G. W. Leibniz and Hermann Lotze as inspirations for his position in his \"Logical Investigations\" (1900–1). Other prominent contemporary Continental philosophers interested in Platonism in a general sense include Leo Strauss, Simone Weil, and Alain Badiou.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On October 15, 2004, he attended the two-day event in Venice Beach, California, where he was among eight finalists chosen. After surviving the first day of eliminations he admitted that he was actually 40 years old — five years over the competition's cut off point — and not 30 as he'd claimed. As a result, he was cut from the competition.\n\nThough he had been cut from \"Tough Enough\", WWE officials invited him to come to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for possible training. He trained between January and June 2005, making his OVW debut on June 25, 2005. During a dark match pitting the team of Seth Skyfire and Robert Fury against Robbie Dawber and his partner, Wright entered the ring and squashed all three men, no-selling the offense of Skyfire in the process. He then announced that he was \"The Boogeyman\" before leaving the building. The Boogeyman gimmick further evolved into a \"monster\" face who would appear when another wrestler said his name and attack him, while not selling any offense he received.\n\nOn the July 11, 2005 episode of \"Raw\", horror movie-style vignettes began airing to promote the debut of \"\"The Boogeyman\"\". After a few weeks, the vignettes were moved from \"Raw\" to \"SmackDown!\", but the planned debut was delayed when Wright hyperextended both knees and needed time to recover. He made his debut on the October 14, 2005 episode of \"SmackDown!\", being brought in by network executive Palmer Cannon as part of a \"new talent initiative\". The storyline referenced to vignettes months ago as promos for a television series on the network called \"The Boogeyman\". The show was cancelled before it could air, but they still had the actor under contract, so he was brought to SmackDown to wrestle. The Boogeyman then proceeded to recite a modified version of the chant \"One, two, Freddy's coming for you \" from the movie \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" before smashing an oversized alarm clock on his own head. For the next few weeks, The Boogeyman appeared in unexpected places backstage (closets, vans, et cetera), reciting different nursery rhymes and holding up clocks before screaming his catchphrase \"\"I'm The Boogeyman and I'm comin' to get'cha!\"\" and laughing maniacally.\n\nAt Survivor Series, The Boogeyman helped \"SmackDown!\" general manager Theodore Long defeat his \"Raw\" counterpart, Eric Bischoff. He made his official in-ring debut on the December 2 episode of \"SmackDown!\", defeating Simon Dean in a squash. During this match, he took a handful of live worms from his pocket and stuffed them into his mouth. Over the next few weeks, Boogeyman's opponents were generally \"flattened\" in the ring, left with worms in their mouths and/or spit on their faces. His official pay-per-view debut was at December's Armageddon when he came to the ring to confront Vito and Nunzio who were dressed as Santa Claus and an elf.\n\nBoogeyman's first major feud occurred with John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL) and his \"fixer\" Jillian Hall, and it began when he stalked the duo throughout a number of shows. During the January 6 episode of \"SmackDown!\", he caught a fleeing Hall and shoved worms down the back of her skirt. On the January 13 taping of \"SmackDown!\", during a \"Piper's Pit\" segment, The Boogeyman not only sniffed a \"growth\" on Jillian's face, but then licked it, bit it off and ate it. The Boogeyman faced Layfield at Royal Rumble, winning in under two minutes.\n\nAfter defeating The Dicks in a handicap match on the February 24 episode of \"SmackDown!\", The Boogeyman dumped a bucket of worms on the announce table, frightening special guest commentators Booker T and his wife Sharmell. The Boogeyman subsequently began to stalk Booker T and Sharmell over the next few weeks. He and Booker T were set to face off on the March 18 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII\", but the match was canceled due to Booker T faking a knee injury to escape competition. The feud eventually culminated at WrestleMania 22, with The Boogeyman defeating Booker T and Sharmell. During the match, Boogeyman kissed Sharmell with a mouthful of worms. The match had to be cut short because of a biceps tear at a house show. To explain his absence to rehab his injury, Booker T and Sharmell obtained a restraining order against The Boogeyman on the April 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\".\n\nAs SummerSlam approached, The Boogeyman began appearing in TV spots to promote the event. Vignettes also began airing advertising his return to \"SmackDown!\". On September 20, WWE.com reported that Wright had been released from the company, however, on October 6, WWE.com announced that Wright had re-signed with the company and would be sent to be trained at Booker T and Stevie Ray's wrestling school in Houston, Texas. Wright returned on the October 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\", attacking and spitting worms into the faces of The Miz and Kristal Marshall. During the feud he again terrorized and stalked his opponents, and eventually ended The Miz's undefeated streak at the Armageddon pay-per-view on December 17.\n\nWright then feuded with Finlay, who ended The Boogeyman's undefeated streak when Hornswoggle interfered. On the February 2 edition of \"SmackDown!\" during a match against Chris Benoit for the WWE United States Championship, Boogeyman abducted Hornswoggle, distracting Finlay and giving Benoit a chance to win the match with a roll-up. On the February 16 edition of \"SmackDown!\" The Boogeyman appeared with a little person of his own, Little Boogeyman, who was portrayed by an actor named Chris Hollyfield. Chris also previously had played Lil Booker T. His purpose was to counteract Hornswoggle, who was proving a problem in one-on-one matches with Finlay. The Boogeyman and the Little Boogeyman lost to Finlay and Hornswoggle in a mixed tag team match at No Way Out. The team lost a rematch the following week on \"SmackDown!\"; Little Boogeyman was pinned by Finlay, after Wright had chased away Hornswoggle.\n\nOn OVW's 400th anniversary show, The Boogeyman made an appearance, losing to Ryan Wilson in a tables match. The Boogeyman returned to in ring action when teamed with Kane during his feud with William Regal and Dave Taylor. This also marked the return of Little Boogeyman. The feud would be short lived as Boogeyman and Little Boogeyman would then start another feud with Finlay and Hornswoggle. Boogeyman and Little Boogeyman were defeated in a mixed tag match by Finlay and Hornswoggle at \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIV\".\n\nThe Boogeyman ended his tenure on \"SmackDown\" with a loss to Mark Henry in a squash match, as part of Henry's new \"Path of Destruction\" gimmick. After that match, Mark Henry then beat up Little Boogeyman who was at ringside, and Henry gave him a body splash, (kayfabe) severely injuring him.\n\nOn the June 11 edition of \"Raw\", The Boogeyman was moved from the SmackDown brand to ECW in the annual WWE draft. The next day he debuted for the brand and defeated Matt Striker, beginning a feud with him. On July 10 in New Orleans, The Boogeyman was a guest during a \"Striker's Classroom\" segment, ostensibly to be educated on worms, only to be attacked by Striker's debuting enforcer, Big Daddy V. The Boogeyman was not seen for the next three weeks, finally re-emerging on the July 31 episode — with a new face paint design and black contact lenses — to scare Big Daddy V off after he finished a match. Boogeyman was taken out by Big Daddy V from behind after a distraction from Striker a week later.\n\nOn the August 14 episode of \"ECW\", Boogeyman scored a disqualification victory over ECW Champion John Morrison after Morrison shoved the referee. Boogeyman went on to successfully team with CM Punk at \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV\" against Morrison and Big Daddy V. On the August 28 episode of \"ECW\", Boogeyman was one of the participants in the Fatal Four Way match for a shot at Morrison's title; however, CM Punk was the victor. On September 4, on \"ECW\", Boogeyman defeated Matt Striker by disqualification when Big Daddy V interfered, and went on to hit Boogeyman with a ghetto drop on the outside of the ring. On the September 18 episode of \"ECW\", Boogeyman and Big Daddy V finally faced off in their first one-on-one match, which Boogeyman lost.\n\nBoogeyman's return to wrestling action was initially delayed due to a torn calf muscle, but it had also been reported that he was having dental surgery done to replace missing teeth. On the October 7 episode of \"ECW\" a vignette was aired promoting The Boogeyman's return. Additional vignettes aired for a few weeks after that. On the October 13, 2008 edition of \"Raw\", The Boogeyman made his return, appearing during a segment with \"Jackass\"'s Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, and Big Dick Johnson ending with The Boogeyman bringing live worms out of a bag and after putting them in his own mouth spat them into the mouth of Pontius.\n\nThe Boogeyman made his ECW return on the November 25 episode, in a segment with John Morrison and The Miz. He made his return to in ring competition on December 9 against Scott Reed, a local talent, who he defeated with ease. On the December 30 episode of \"ECW\", he lost to John Morrison and The Miz in a No DQ match with Finlay as his partner. On the January 20, 2009 edition of \"ECW\", he defeated Paul Burchill by disqualification, his first victory over a non-enhancement talent since returning to the brand. His last appearance on WWE programming was on March 3, 2009 where he lost in a match against Kane. The next day on March 4, 2009, WWE announced that they had released Wright from his WWE contract.\n\nAfter WWE, Wright returned to the Pro Wrestling Alliance using his Boogeyman gimmick. Later, using a new gimmick called \"Slither\", he wrestled at Northeast Wrestling as The Nightcrawler, defeating Jake Manning. Wright made his debut for The Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF) at Soul Survivor VI on April 24, 2010. He defeated \"Executioner\" Brian Milonas. During late December 2011 Wright made an appearance on UWD (United Wrestling Destruction) where he defeated newcomer Harry Janes at the special event \"Win Or Lose.\" He returned using his old The Boogeyman gimmick at Cyberstarz event of Millennium Wrestling Federation on February 2012, where he defeated Lukas Sharp. After that, he left the wrestling business for quite some time, before he decided to return on July 9, 2012, where he was available on independent scene bookings. On August 11, 2013, Wright using The Boogeyman gimmick made an appearance for Juggalo Championship Wrestling's Bloodymania 7 teaming with Kongo Kong to face 2 Tuff Tony and a returning Vampiro in a losing effort. On September 3, 2017, as The Boogeyman, he defeated The Horror for All Out Mayhem wrestling.\n\nIn March 2019 he wrestled the Dreamcather at WWW in a losing effort.\n\nOn the December 16, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", Wright returned as The Boogeyman during the Slammy Awards, sneaking up on former rival Booker T.\n\nBoogeyman appeared in Halloween themed videos on the WWE YouTube channel in both November 2013 and October 2014. On the December 22, 2014 episode of \"Raw\", Boogeyman appeared in a segment on the WWE App.\n\nOn January 25, 2015 at Royal Rumble, Boogeyman entered the Royal Rumble match as a surprise entrant at number 7 marking his first WWE in–ring performance in almost six years, but was quickly eliminated by Bray Wyatt. On November 6, it was announced that Wright has signed a legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) with WWE. On January 22, 2018, Boogeyman made an appearance on \"Raw 25 Years\". On July 22, 2019, Boogeyman appeared at the Raw Reunion show, and scared Drake Maverick in the locker room, helping Pat Patterson pin Maverick and win the WWE 24/7 Championship.\n\nWright has been married to his wife Melissa George since 1984.\n\nAs of 2018, Wright is working as an aerobics instructor in Denver, CO.\n\nIn January 2013, Wright appeared on two short promos featuring Bobby Lashley to promote Lashley's family fitness center in Aurora, Colorado named American Top Team Altitude.\n\nIn 2015, Wright appeared in two episodes of the WWE Network series, \"Swerved\", a hidden camera prank show by \"Jackass\" co-creator Jeff Tremaine.

The mission was built in order to convert local Native Americans to Christianity and solidify Spanish territorial claims in the New World against encroachment from France. Today, the structure is one of four missions that comprise San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.\n\nFounded in 1690 as San Francisco de los Tejas near Weches, Texas and southwest of present-day Alto, Texas, Mission San Francisco de la Espada was the second mission established in Texas.\n\nThree priests, three soldiers and supplies were left among the Nabedache Indians. The new mission was dedicated on June 1, 1690. A smallpox epidemic in the winter of 1690-1691 killed an estimated 3,300 people in the area. The Nabedache believed the Spaniards brought the disease and hostilities developed between the two groups.\n\nDrought besieged the mission in the summers of 1691 and 1692, and the Nabedache wished to get rid of the mission. Under threat of personal attack, the priests began packing their belongings in the fall of 1693. On October 25, 1693, the padres burned the mission and retreated toward Monclova. The party lost its way and did not reach Monclova until February 17, 1694.\n\nThe mission was re-established in the same area on July 5, 1716 as Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas. The new mission had to be abandoned in 1719 because of conflict between Spain and France.\n\nThe mission was tried once more on August 5, 1721 as San Francisco de los Neches. As the Nabedache were no longer interested in the mission, and France had abandoned effort to lay claim in the area, the mission was temporarily relocated along the Colorado River in July 1730. Mission Tejas State Park encompasses the original site of the mission.\n\nThe mission relocated to its current location in the San Antonio River area (coordinates 29.3177°, -98.4498°) in March, 1731 and was renamed San Francisco De la Espada. A friary was built in 1745, and the church was completed in 1756. The relocation was in part inspired by fears of French encroachment and need for more Missionaries to tend to San Antonio de Bexar's Indian population. The Mission encountered great difficulties in presiding over the Indian population and experienced common rebellious activity.\n\nSeveral modern churches have been architecturally based on the design of this mission including St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Wimberley, Texas, north of San Antonio.\n\nRancho de las Cabras was established between 1750 and 1760, 30 miles southeast of San Antonio de Bexar under the jurisdiction of Mission Espada, so as to provide land for cultivation of crops and livestock for the Mission's population without intruding on private lands. The ranch was primarily made up by low fences and thatched buildings known as \"jacales\" for the native workforce to inhabit. According to Ethno-Historian T.N. Campbell, the ranch was likely constructed by Indians not native to Texas. It is listed separately as part of the World Heritage Site.\n\nMission San Francisco de la Espada's acequia and aqueduct can still be seen today. The main ditch continues to carry water to the mission and its former farm lands. This water is still used by residents living on these neighboring lands.\n\nThe use of acequias was originally brought to the arid regions of Spain and Portugal by the Romans and the Moors. When Franciscans missionaries arrived in the desert Southwest they found the system worked well in the hot, dry environment.\n\nIn order to distribute water to the missions along the San Antonio River, Franciscan missionaries oversaw the construction of seven gravity-flow ditches, dams, and at least one aqueduct — a network that irrigated approximately of land.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221022", "title": "Eleutheran Adventurers", "text": "Eleutheran Adventurers\n\nThe Eleutheran Adventurers were a group of English Puritans and religious Independents who left Bermuda to settle on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas in the late 1640s. The small group of Puritan settlers, led by a man named William Sayle, were expelled from Bermuda for their failure to swear allegiance to the Crown, and left in search of a place in which they could freely practice their faith. This group represented the first concerted European effort to colonize the Bahamas.\n\nThe mid-17th century was a period of constant religious and political turmoil in England, culminating in the English Civil War. The first part of the conflict was fought between King Charles I and the Parliament of England, and led ultimately to the Protectorship of the Puritan general, Oliver Cromwell. This conflict spread to Bermuda, where a period of civil strife resulted in a victory for the supporters of the Loyalist party. The struggle eventually led to the expulsion of the colony's Puritans and independents to the Bahamas, which the English had laid claim to in 1629, but had not permanently settled. Earlier in 1644, the Bermudian Independent Puritans had sent an expedition to explore these new islands.\n\nNevertheless, sometime between spring 1646 and autumn 1648, Sayle took some seventy people to settle in the Bahamas. They made landfall on the island called Cigateo, which they named Eleutheria, from the Greek word for \"freedom\", although the name later became Eleuthera. The island's original inhabitants, the Lucayans, had been decimated through the slaving activities of the Spanish and the numerous European diseases, especially smallpox, that followed.\n\nWilliam Sayle and his assistant Captain Butler were the persons who began a voyage to The Bahamas in two different vessels. William Sayle's vessel was called the \"William\". During the voyage Captain Butler and William Sayle had an argument with each other about what religious freedom means. As a solution to this problem, Sayle left Captain Butler and went forward to reach the Bahamian Islands. The settlers ran into trouble before they even landed, when they encountered a storm and their ship ran aground onto rocks, later called the Devil's Backbone, north of Spanish Wells. The adventurers found their way ashore and took refuge in what was later called Preacher's Cave, where a religious service was held every year for the next 100 years on the anniversary in thankfulness for their survival. However, although the settlers had shelter, they had lost their provisions so they had no food. Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others. More colonists expelled from Bermuda arrived in 1649 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies. This time it was the sympathetic Puritans of New England who rallied to their cause and collected £800 for all the supplies they needed, allowing the colony to survive. The Eleutheran people later showed their thankfulness by sending shiploads of the extremely valuable Braziletto wood to Boston, with instructions to sell it and donate the proceeds to Harvard University.\n\nAnother source of trouble for the colony was dissent within its ranks from the beginning. Before they had even landed, a Captain Butler made so many problems, by refusing to accept any authority, that Sayle and others were obliged to find another island. They named the new island they moved to 'Sayle Island', which was later renamed 'New Providence'. The colony was not an immediate success in economic terms. Its soil yielded little production and the settlers barely got by during their first years, being obliged to live by salvaging what they could from shipwrecks. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a number of supplies from the mainland colonies. Despite this the colony did not do much better in the following years and in the end only a few hardcore settlers from the original Eleutherans were left. Sayle himself went on to become Governor of South Carolina, but continued to have a vested personal interest in Eleuthera. He used this influence to secure some trade for the island and so helped the community through its infancy. This episode is thought to be the historical source of Andrew Marvell's poem \"Bermudas,\" written in praise of the Puritan settlers of the New World, and one of the earliest statements of the so-called \"American Dream\". According to the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature\" (7th ed., p. 1686), \"The poem was probably written after 1653, when Marvell took up residence in the house of John Oxenbridge, who had twice visited the Bermudas.\"\n\nThe new colony was to be governed by the Articles and Orders of 1647, drawn up by William Sayle. The articles reflect the ambiguities of the English Civil War taking place at that time between Royalists and Parliamentarians. Therefore, while the preamble refers to the \"Raign of our Soveraign Lord Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; Defender of the Faith, &c\", the articles themselves make clear that the new settlement was to be effectively independent, making no further mention of the Crown. On the contrary, the articles speak of the rules governing the \"Members of the Republick\" and the \"Magistracie or officers of the Republicke\". The articles established freedom of religion and opinion, three hundred acres of land per settler, governance under a governor and twelve councillors chosen from a senate composed of the first 100 settlers, and humane treatment of any indigenous people still on the island. It has been noted that if Sayle's settlement had been successful, then he would have created in the Bahamas \"the first democratic state in the New World\", some 130 years before the American Revolution.\n\n"}

For example, let\n\nbe a permutation that maps 1 to 2, 6 to 8, etc. Then one may write\n\nHere 5 and 7 are fixed points of \"π\", since \"π\"(5)=5 and \"π\"(7)=7. It is typical, but not necessary, to not write the cycles of length one in such an expression. Thus, π = (1 2 4 3)(6 8), would be an appropriate way to express this permutation.\n\nThere are different ways to write a permutation as a list of its cycles, but the number of cycles and their contents are given by the partition of \"S\" into orbits, and these are therefore the same for all such expressions.\n\nThe unsigned Stirling number of the first kind, \"s\"(\"k\", \"j\") counts the number of permutations of \"k\" elements with exactly \"j\" disjoint cycles.\n\nThe value \"f\"(\"k\", \"j\") counts the number of permutations of \"k\" elements with exactly \"j\" fixed points. For the main article on this topic, see rencontres numbers.\n\n(3) There are three different methods to construct a permutation of \"k\" elements with \"j\" fixed points:\n\nExample: \"f\"(5, 1) = 5×1×4! − 10×2×3! + 10×3×2! - 5×4×1! + 1×5×0!\n\nExample: \"f\"(5, 0) = 120 - ( 5×4! - 10×3! + 10×2! - 5×1! + 1×0! )\n\nExample: \"f\"(5, 0) = 4 × ( 9 + 2 ) = 4 × 11 = 44\n\nExample: \"f\"(5, 0) = 120 × ( 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24 - 1/120 )\n\n\n"}

As a result, the QSNCC was constructed as a sign of Thailand's commitment to host this event. As for the architectural design, a leading Thai architectural firm was assigned to design a structure that reflected Thai culture and heritage for the QSNCC.\n\nTo ensure that the center would be completed on time, a design-build delivery system was used and the construction started in late 1989. Construction began with 100 designers and more than 1000 construction workers. The bulk of construction was finished by June 1991, under budget and about two months before the scheduled date of August 1991. It was finished in only 16 months. Projects of this magnitude normally take 40 months.\n\nOn 29 August 1991, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit officially opened the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center.

In 1857, Rau & Reisky Brewery, later changed to Reisky & Spies, was established. In 1878, Reisky & Spies was purchased and renamed as the Genesee Brewery. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the company was reopened as the Genesee Brewing Company.\n\nIn December 1984, it purchased the Fred Koch Brewery of Dunkirk, New York. At the time The Fred Koch Brewery was owned by Vaux Breweries of Sunderland, England. In the previous year Koch sold about 55,000 barrels of beer, compared with Genesee's 3.2 million. Genesee transferred the brewing of Koch's brands to Rochester which it continued through the 2000s.\nIn 2000, the company was sold to an employee investment group, and the company's name was changed to High Falls Brewing Company. In 2007, Norman Snyder was named CEO of the company, and announced a change in the Genesee brand labeling, which highlights a more classic look. The company also unveiled a new corporate website and increased marketing of the Genesee brand of beers.\n\nIn February 2009, High Falls Brewery was sold to a New York City investment group KPS Capital Partners to be run as part of its North American Breweries subsidiary.\n\nIn June 2009, North American Breweries announced that the name of the brewery would be changed back to Genesee Brewing Company to reflect the company's long history.\n\nIn October 2012, it was purchased by FIFCO in an all-cash deal for $338 million.

An estimated 20,000–40,000 people gathered on Castlemorton Common for the party which lasted a full week, the biggest of its kind since the Stonehenge Free Festival in the mid-1980s.\n\nCastlemorton hosted many of the large sound systems of the time such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, Spiral Tribe and DiY Sound System, and bands such as Back To The Planet, Xenophobia (fronted by Spiral Tribe's MC Skallywag), AOS3 and Poisoned Electrick Head.\n\nSimon Reynolds wrote that \"during the next five days of its existence, Castlemorton will inspire questions in Parliament, make the front page of every newspaper in England and incite nationwide panic about the whereabouts of the next destination on the crusty itinerary.\" \n\nSpeaking in a House of Commons debate, the local MP at the time, Michael Spicer, opined, \"new age travellers, ravers and drugs racketeers arrived at a strength of two motorised army divisions, complete with several massed bands and, above all, a highly sophisticated command and signals system. However, they failed to bring latrines. The numbers, speed and efficiency with which they arrived—amounting at one time to as many as 30,000 people—combined to terrorise the local community to the extent that some residents had to undergo psychiatric treatment in the days that followed. Such an incident must never happen again, in my constituency or elsewhere. We need tighter laws, especially to give banning powers to the police; a Cabinet Committee to bring responsible Departments together; quicker and more co-ordinated police action; and a more effective application of existing policies by national and local authorities.\"\n\nThirteen members of Spiral Tribe were arrested after the event, and charged with public order offences. After a lengthy and costly trial, they were acquitted.\n\nConcerns about the festival and the way in which it was policed inspired the legislation which developed into the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. \nThis wide-ranging Act effectively made illegal such outdoor parties playing music that, as defined in section 63(1)(b), incorporates \"sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\".\n\nWhilst some have argued that Castlemorton, with its attendant publicity, led directly to the Criminal Justice Act and was the \"final nail in the coffin of the unlicensed event\", others have seen the Act as a draconian piece of legislation which was \"explicitly aimed at suppressing the activities of certain strands of alternative culture\".\n\n\n"}

He was one of the pioneers of the idea of growing food without pesticides or chemical fertilizers. \n\nHe was born in Lititz, Pennsylvania. He earned an undergraduate degree at Lebanon Valley College and a master's degree in mathematics at Yale University. Before starting Walnut Acres, he taught mathematics at Drew University. He learned about organic farming from Sir Albert Howard while teaching in northern India. When he returned to the US, he studied further at the School of Living, in Suffern, New York and Kimberton Farm School in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile in India, he was involved with Mohandas Gandhi and the Indian independence movement.\n\nHe also met his wife while in India. Her name was Enid Betty Morgan, and she was the daughter of missionaries. They were married in 1940; she died in 1987.\n\nHis first big breakthrough in selling organic foods came when Clementine Paddleford, the New York Herald-Tribune food editor, was entranced by the farm's first product, Apple Essence, an apple butter.\n\nWalnut Acres was started just after World War II. In 1994, it had sales of close to $8 million annually. Keene sold the company in 2000.

In Central Europe they occur in the warmer regions, but have become generally rare. By contrast, they are still common in the Mediterranean and Southern Alps. They live in sparse forests and their edges, on dry shrubbery and in orchards. It is an extreme rarity in Britain, although it used to be widespread throughout England and Wales. Most of the specimens seen in Britain are thought to be captive-bred releases. These butterflies mainly inhabit woodland, especially with sallows (willows).\n\n\"Nymphalis polychloros\" has a wingspan of in males, of in females. These medium to large butterflies have orange to red wings with black and yellow patches. Both wings with yellowish submarginal lunules, upon which follows a black band which is likewise composed of lunules and bears on the hindwing small blue spots. The underside of the wings is smoky brown with darker shades and black transverse pencilling. There is no sexual dimorphism.\nThis species looks very similar to the small tortoiseshell (\"Aglais urticae\"), but it is more closely related to the Camberwell beauty and \"Nymphalis xanthomelas\" It differs from the small tortoiseshell by its larger size (45–62 mm. wingspan in \"Aglais urticae\") and by the more orange ground colour of the upper surface of its wings and the orange base of its hindwings. The forewing is orange-brown, with 3 costal black blotches, 3 large black spots in the disc posteriorly and a narrow blackish terminal band – less bright than those of \"A. urticae\", and lacking the apical white spot and the marginal blue dots of that species. Compared to the yellow-legged tortoiseshell it has yellower interspaces between the black blotches on the costal edges of its forewings and the dark marginal band is narrower. The surest way to recognize it, however, is by its dark haired tarsi yellow-legged tortoiseshell’s tarsal hairs are light-coloured.\n\nThe adult insect (imago) over-winters in dry dark places, such as hollow trees or out buildings. In late February or early March the butterflies emerge and mate. The females lay their pale green eggs (ova) in a continuous band around the upper twigs of elm (\"Ulmus\" spp.), sallow (\"Salix caprea\" and \"Salix viminalis\"), pear (\"Pyrus\" spp.), \"Malus\", \"Sorbus\", \"Crataegus\", \"Populus\", and \"Prunus\" spp. trees.\n\nThe caterpillars (larvae) are gregarious, and systematically strip the topmost twigs of the tree bare. They seem to have little defence against predation by birds. It is possible that their decline and extinction in the British Isles (late 1970s) was owing to the loss of predatory birds, which previously had preyed upon smaller birds if they strayed to the tops of these trees.\n\nThe full-grown larva spins a silk girdle around a twig further down the tree, and hangs from this by means of hooks (cremaster) at its rear end, to pupate. The chrysalis (pupa) is greyish brown with a slight silvery sheen. The species is univoltine, i.e. there is only one generation per year, the imagines emerging in July and August seek out sources high in sugar on which to feed. Tree sap and fermenting fruit are particularly popular.\n\n"}

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director (Carol Reed) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Graham Greene), and won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film.\n\nThe film is told through the naive eyes of a diplomat's young son, Philippe, who idolises his father's butler, Baines. Baines has invented a heroic persona to keep the boy entertained, and often tells him stories of his exotic and daring adventures in Africa and elsewhere, stories such as putting down a native uprising single-handedly, killing a man in self-defence, shooting lions and so on.\n\nIn reality, the butler has never been to Africa and is stuck in a loveless marriage, while dreaming of happiness with a younger woman (who he tells Philippe is his niece after the boy finds them together). After Baines has an argument with his betrayed wife, she accidentally falls from a landing to her death. However, Philippe believes that he has seen Baines murder her. The boy desperately and clumsily attempts to protect his hero when the police investigate, but his efforts only lead Baines deeper into trouble.\n\n\nThe cameras began turning on the film on the bright, sunny morning of Wednesday, 17 September 1947, with the first location scene to be filmed being that of Bobby Henrey running across Belgrave Square in London.\n\n\"The Fallen Idol\" marks the first notable film Carol Reed made at Grosvenor Crescent, Belgravia, in London as a filming location — the other being Reed's acclaimed movie \"Oliver!\", filmed 20 years later at the same site. Coincidentally, it was a film featuring a similar seven-year-old precocious boy.\n\n\"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" called the film \"outstanding.\"\n\nIt was one of the most popular movies at the British box office in 1948.\n\n\"The Fallen Idol\" was included at number 48 on \"Time Out\" magazine's list of the \"100 best British films\", which polled critics and members of the film industry. It was described as \"one of the finest British films about children, about the ways they can be manipulated and betrayed, their loyalties misplaced and their emotions toyed with.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Note that having the perfect set property is not the same as being a perfect set.\n\nAs nonempty perfect sets in a Polish space always have the cardinality of the continuum, and the reals form a Polish space, a set of reals with the perfect set property cannot be a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis, stated in the form that every uncountable set of reals has the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe Cantor–Bendixson theorem states that closed sets of a Polish space \"X\" have the perfect set property in a particularly strong form: any closed subset of \"X\" may be written uniquely as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable set. In particular, every uncountable Polish space has the perfect set property, and can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable open set.\n\nThe axiom of choice implies the existence of sets of reals that do not have the perfect set property, such as Bernstein sets. However, in Solovay's model, which satisfies all axioms of ZF but not the axiom of choice, every set of reals has the perfect set property, so the use of the axiom of choice is necessary. Every analytic set has the perfect set property. It follows from the existence of sufficiently large cardinals that every projective set has the perfect set property.\n"}

Luxembourg became independent, while remaining in personal union with the Netherlands, after the signing of the Treaty of London in 1839. The personal union proved short-lived as it was bilaterally and amicably dissolved in 1890.\n\nLegally, all citizens of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are considered to be \"Luxembourgers\" per Luxembourgish law, although a distinct Germanic ethnolinguistic identification is vocally espoused and promoted. The corresponding adjective is \"Luxembourgish\".\n\nMost ethnic Luxembourgers live in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a small country in Europe between Germany, France, and Belgium, and are of Celtic/Gallo-Roman and Germanic (Frankish) origin. Most speak Luxembourgish, as their native language, in addition to French and German. Despite the rather small number of Luxembourgers, there is a relatively large diaspora, in Europe and elsewhere. Particularly, there are populations in the surrounding countries of Belgium, France, and Germany. For the most part, this is due to historic reasons, especially the three Partitions of Luxembourg, which led to former territories of Luxembourg being incorporated into each of the three surrounding countries.\n\nThere are also significant populations in the Americas, with the largest contingent being in the United States. However, many people of Luxembourgish descent also live in Canada and Brazil, to which large waves of Luxembourgers emigrated in the nineteenth century, as did Germans at the same time. Others migrated to Hungary along with Germans during the first phase of German eastward settlement in the 12th century.

His style is difficult to classify.\n\nMetzer learned the craft of stone-cutting in Breslau with Christian Behrens and did apprenticeships in Saxony through 1894. He founded his own studio in Berlin in 1896 and worked predominantly for the royal porcelain factory until 1903, and became a professor at the Vienna college of arts and sciences. Metzner achieved fame by winning a Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900).\n\nAmong his important works are the sculptures for Josef Hoffmann's 1904–1911 landmark Vienna Secession Palais Stoclet in Brussels, including the eccentric four green male nudes at the summit of the building. The Palais Stoclet is an example of \"Gesamtkunstwerk\", the integration of art and architecture, one of the goals of Jugendstil, and it had notable influence on birth of Art Deco.\n\nIn 1910 Metzner met the vacationing Frank Lloyd Wright and, according to the scholarship of Anthony Alofsin, Metzer affected Wright's \"conventionalization\" of the human figure and its incorporation into buildings like the Larkin Building and Midway Gardens. Around the same time, Metzner's designs influenced Czech artists working in Prague, Stanislav Sucharda among them.\n\nA famous work is the 1913 Völkerschlachtdenkmal (People's Battle Monument), designed by the architect Bruno Schmitz in Leipzig. Metzner executed the powerful and strangely scaled interior figural-architectural sculpture in the \"Hecker Tomb\" with his teacher Behrens. The Monument was inaugurated in 1913 by Kaiser Wilhelm II. It is unique and imposing combination of Wilhelmine and Jugendstil styles.\n\nMuch of Metzner's work in Germany was lost in World War II.\n\n\n\n"}

Set in a new world unrelated to her previous trilogies, the Soldier Son Trilogy follows the life of Nevare Burvelle, the second son of a newly elevated Lord of the Kingdom of Gernia.\n\nThe career of a person living in Gernia is heavily influenced by their parentage. Those sons born to common parentage follow their father's career. However, for the sons of a noble, things are different. The eldest son inherits his father's title, the second son serves as an officer in the army, the third son enters priesthood, while the fourth becomes an artist. This allocation continues for further sons. Daughters are relegated to submissive roles, being primarily used to forge social links with arranged marriages.\n\nThe first book, \"Shaman's Crossing\", concerns Nevare's education. As a young boy on the vast plains, his position as the second son, the Soldier Son, is cemented from birth. From an early age, Nevare is drilled in mounted cavalla (Cavalry) techniques, riding, survival, tactics, and all aspects of life as an officer in the King's Cavalla. As a teenager, he has a first encounter with the Specks' magic (see below), which will influence the rest of his life. Later, as a young man, Nevare's education at the King's Cavalla Academy begins. Nevare suffers the consequences of being the son of a New Noble, when the struggle between Old Nobles and New Nobles in the court of Gernia affects the supposedly independent Academy.\n\nBook two, \"Forest Mage\", concerns Nevare's trip in disgrace to a town near Gettys, and his time at this farthest outpost in the King's Road construction. His connection with the Specks, a race of tree people who live on after their corporeal lives, develops further. The changes imposed to his body by the Specks' magic he wields, causes rejection and discrimination by most Gernians, including his family. In spite of it, he still pursues his dream of a military career. At the same time, he also tries to save the Specks' ancestors forest from the devastations produced by the Gernian's road advance.\n\nThe third and final book, \"Renegade's Magic\", details Nevare's sojourn with the Specks in their extensive forest near the Barrier Mountains. His cousin and her husband Spink continue to deal with events in Gettys. Nevare's disjoint personalities are united to realize the initial goal of the magic, in spite of the serious consequences it has on Nevare's life. But balance is finally achieved.\n\nThe world in which \"Soldier Son Trilogy\" is set is a post-colonial one. A civilised and warlike nation, Gernia, has taken to expanding its boundaries inland as a result of its coastal lands being lost to a neighbour's vastly superior naval force. The move inland involves conquering and assimilating native peoples- Plainsmen and Specks. It has been only one or two generations since the Plainsmen have been beaten into submission, and racial and cultural tensions simmer underneath the thin veneer of civilization. But even earlier, the Specks had beaten the fiercest Plainsmen warriors using simply magic. Both Gernians and Specks consider their societies, philosophies, and ways of life the only \"civilized\" options.\n\nThe greater themes of the series so far are: post-colonial backlash, loss of cultural identity, racial preconception and discrimination, and \"Going Native\"- a term applied to those of \"civilized\" nature who abandon their own culture and adopt the lifestyle of a more \"savage\" persuasion. Rigid class and gender stratification and limited opportunities for everybody are consistent with post-colonial times. Explicit magic and shamanism opposes conventional religion and rationalism.\n"}

The son of al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Asma bint Abi Bakr, Ibn al-Zubayr belonged to the Quraysh, the leading tribe of the nascent Muslim community, and was the first child born to the Muhajirun, Islam's earliest converts. As a youth, he participated in the early Muslim conquests alongside his father in Syria and Egypt, and later played a role in the Muslim conquests of North Africa and northern Iran in 647 and 650, respectively. During the First Muslim Civil War, he fought on the side of his aunt A'isha against Caliph Ali (). Though little is heard of Ibn al-Zubayr during the subsequent reign of the first Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I (), it was known that he opposed the latter's designation of his son, Yazid I, as his successor. Ibn al-Zubayr, along with much of the Quraysh and the Ansar, the leading Muslim groups of the Hejaz (western Arabia), opposed the caliphate becoming an inheritable institution of the Umayyads.\n\nIbn al-Zubayr established himself in Mecca where he rallied opposition to Yazid (), before proclaiming himself caliph in the wake of Yazid's death in 683, marking the beginning of the Second Muslim Civil War. Meanwhile, Yazid's son and successor died weeks into his reign, precipitating the collapse of Umayyad authority across the Caliphate, most of whose provinces subsequently accepted the suzerainty of Ibn al-Zubayr. Though widely recognized as caliph, his authority was largely nominal outside of the Hejaz. By 685, the Umayyad Caliphate had been reconstituted under Marwan I in Syria and Egypt, while Zubayrid authority was being challenged in Iraq and Arabia by pro-Alid and Kharijite forces. Ibn al-Zubayr's brother Mus'ab reasserted Ibn al-Zubayr's suzerainty in Iraq by 687, but was defeated and killed by Marwan's successor Abd al-Malik in 691. The Umayyad commander al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf proceeded to besiege Ibn al-Zubayr in his Meccan stronghold, where he was ultimately slain in 692.\n\nThrough the prestige of his family ties and social links with the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his strong association with the holy city of Mecca, Ibn al-Zubayr was able to lead the influential, disaffected Muslim factions opposed to Umayyad rule. He sought to reestablish the Hejaz as the political center of the Caliphate. However, his refusal to leave Mecca precluded him from exercising power in the more populous provinces where he depended on his brother Mus'ab and other loyalists, who ruled with virtual independence. He thus played a minor active role in the struggle carried out in his name.\n\nAbd Allah ibn al-Zubayr was born in Medina in the Hejaz (western Arabia) in May 624. He was the eldest son of al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, a \"ṣaḥābī\" (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a leading Muslim figure. He belonged to the Banu Asad clan of the Quraysh, the dominant tribe of Mecca, a trade center in the Hejaz and location of the Ka'aba, the holiest sanctuary in Islam. Ibn al-Zubayr's paternal grandmother was Safiyya bint Abd al-Muttalib, the paternal aunt of Muhammad, and his mother was Asma, a daughter of the first caliph, Abu Bakr (), and sister of A'isha, a wife of Muhammad. According to the 9th-century historians Ibn Habib and Ibn Qutayba, Ibn al-Zubayr was the first child born to the Muhajirun, the earliest converts to Islam who had been exiled from Mecca to Medina. These early social, kinship and religious links to Muhammad, his family and the first Muslims all boosted Ibn al-Zubayr's reputation in adulthood.\n\nIbn al-Zubayr had a number of wives and children. His first wife was Tumadir bint Manzur ibn Zabban ibn Sayyar ibn Amr of the Banu Fazara. She bore him his eldest son Khubayb, hence Ibn al-Zubayr's \"kunya\" (epithet) \"Abu Khubayb\", and other sons Hamza, Abbad, al-Zubayr and Thabit. She or another of Ibn al-Zubayr's wives, Umm al-Hasan Nafisa, a daughter of Hasan, son of the fourth caliph Ali () and grandson of Muhammad, bore his daughter Ruqayya. Tumadir's sister Zajla was at one point married to Ibn al-Zubayr. He was also married to A'isha, a daughter of the third caliph Uthman ibn Affan (). A'isha or Nafisa mothered Ibn al-Zubayr's son Bakr, of whom little is reported in the traditional sources. Ibn al-Zubayr divorced A'isha following the birth of their son. From another wife, Hantama bint Abd al-Rahman ibn Hisham, Ibn al-Zubayr had his son 'Amir.\n\nAs a child, during the reign of Caliph Umar in 636, Ibn al-Zubayr may have been present with his father at the Battle of Yarmouk against the Byzantines in Syria. He was also present with his father in Amr ibn al-As's campaign against Byzantine Egypt in 640. In 647, Ibn al-Zubayr distinguished himself in the Muslim conquest of Ifriqiya (North Africa) under the commander Abd Allah ibn Sa'd. During that campaign, Ibn al-Zubayr discovered a vulnerable point in the battle lines of the Byzantine defenders and slew their patrician, Gregory. He was lauded by Caliph Uthman and issued a victory speech, well known for its eloquence, upon his return to Medina. Later, he joined Sa'id ibn al-As in the latter's offensive in northern Iran in 650. Uthman appointed Ibn al-Zubayr to the commission charged with the recension of the Qur'an. During the rebel siege of Uthman's house in June 656, the caliph put Ibn al-Zubayr in charge of his defense and he was reportedly wounded in the fighting. In the aftermath of Uthman's assassination, Ibn al-Zubayr fought alongside his father and his aunt A'isha against the partisans of Uthman's successor, Caliph Ali, at the Battle of the Camel in Basra in December. Al-Zubayr was killed, while Ibn al-Zubayr was wounded sparring with one of Ali's commanders, Malik al-Ashtar. Ali was victorious and Ibn al-Zubayr returned with A'isha to Medina, later taking part in the arbitration to end the First Fitna (Muslim civil war) in Adhruh or Dumat al-Jandal. During the talks, he counseled Abd Allah ibn Umar to pay for the support of Amr ibn al-As. Ibn al-Zubayr inherited a significant fortune from his father.\n\nIbn al-Zubayr did not oppose Mu'awiya I's accession to the caliphate in 661 and remained largely inactive during the course of his reign. However, he refused to recognize Mu'awiya's nomination of his son Yazid I as his successor in 676. When Yazid acceded following his father's death in 680, Ibn al-Zubayr again rejected his legitimacy, despite Yazid having the backing of the Arab tribesmen of Syria who formed the core of the Umayyad military. In response, Yazid charged al-Walid ibn Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, the governor of Medina, with gaining Ibn al-Zubayr's submission, but he evaded the authorities and escaped to Mecca. He was joined there by Ali's son Husayn, who too had refused submission to Yazid. Husayn and his supporters made a stand against the Umayyads in Karbala in 680, but were killed and Husayn was slain.\n\nFollowing Husayn's death, Ibn al-Zubayr began clandestinely recruiting supporters. By September 683, he had taken control of Mecca. He referred to himself as \"al-ʿaʾidh biʾl bayt\" (the fugitive at the sanctuary, \"viz.\", the Ka'aba), adopted the slogan \"lā ḥukma illā li-ʾllāh\" (judgement belongs to God alone), but made no claim to the caliphate. Yazid ordered the governor of Medina, Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As, to arrest Ibn al-Zubayr. The governor, in turn, charged Ibn al-Zubayr's estranged brother, the head of Medina's \"shūrṭā\" (security forces), Amr, to lead the expedition. The Umayyad force was ambushed and Amr was captured and killed in captivity. Ibn al-Zubayr declared the illegitimacy of Yazid's caliphate and allied with the Ansar of Medina, led by Abd Allah ibn Hanzala, who had withdrawn support for Yazid due to his alleged improprieties. Ibn al-Zubayr also gained the support of the Kharijite movement in Basra and Bahrayn (eastern Arabia); the Kharijites were early opponents of the Umayyads who had defected from Caliph Ali because of his participation in the 657 arbitration. \n\nIn response to growing opposition throughout Arabia, Yazid dispatched a Syrian Arab expeditionary force led by Muslim ibn Uqba to suppress Ibn al-Zubayr and the Ansar. The Ansar were routed at the Battle of al-Harrah in the summer of 683, and Ibn Hanzala was slain. The army continued toward Mecca, but Ibn Uqba died en route and command passed to his deputy Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni. The latter besieged the city on 24 September after Ibn al-Zubayr refused to surrender. The Ka'aba was severely damaged during al-Sakuni's bombardment. During the siege, two potential Qurashi candidates for the caliphate, Mus'ab ibn Abd al-Rahman and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama, were killed or died of natural causes. In November, news of Yazid's death prompted al-Sakuni to negotiate with Ibn al-Zubayr. The former proposed to recognize him as caliph on the condition that he would rule from Syria, the center of the Umayyad military and administration. Ibn al-Zubayr rejected this and the army withdrew to Syria, leaving him in control of Mecca.\n\nYazid's death and the subsequent withdrawal of the Umayyad army from the Hejaz afforded Ibn al-Zubayr the opportunity to realize his aspirations for the caliphate. He immediately declared himself \"amīr al-muʾminīn\" (commander of the faithful), a title traditionally reserved for the caliph, and called for the Muslims to give him their oaths of allegiance. With the other potential Hejazi candidates dead, Ibn al-Zubayr remained the last contender for the caliphate among the anti-Umayyad factions in Mecca and Medina and these groups recognized him as their leader. An exception to this came from the Banu Hashim clan to which the prophet Muhammad and the Alids belonged and whose support Ibn al-Zubayr deemed important for his own legitimacy as caliph. The leading representatives of the clan in the Hejaz, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, the half-brother of Husayn ibn Ali, and their cousin Abd Allah ibn Abbas, withheld their oaths citing the need for a stronger consensus in the wider Muslim community. Irritated, Ibn al-Zubayr besieged the clan's neighborhood in Mecca and imprisoned Ibn al-Hanafiyya to pressure the Banu Hashim. Meanwhile, the Kharijites under Najda ibn Amir al-Hanafi in the Yamama (central Arabia) abandoned Ibn al-Zubayr once he forwarded his claim to the caliphate, an institution they rejected, and refused to embrace their doctrine.\n\nIn the Umayyad capital Damascus, Yazid was succeeded by his young son Mu'awiya II, but the latter wielded virtually no authority and died from illness months after his accession. This left a leadership void in Syria as there were no suitable successors among Mu'awiya I's Sufyanid house. In the ensuing chaos, Umayyad authority collapsed across the caliphate and Ibn al-Zubayr gained wide recognition. Most of the Islamic provinces offered their allegiance, including Egypt, Kufa, Yemen and the Qaysi tribes of northern Syria. Likewise, in Khurasan, the \"de facto\" governor Abd Allah ibn Khazim al-Sulami offered his recognition. Ibn al-Zubayr appointed his brother Mus'ab as governor of Basra and its dependencies. In a testament to the extent of Ibn al-Zubayr's sovereignty, coins were minted in his name as far as the districts of Kerman and Fars in modern-day Iran; both were dependencies of Basra. Nonetheless, his authority outside of the Hejaz was largely nominal.\n\nMost of the Arab tribes in central and southern Syria remained loyal to the Umayyads and selected the non-Sufyanid Marwan ibn al-Hakam from Medina to succeed Mu'awiya II. The proclamation of Marwan as caliph in Damascus marked a turning point against Ibn al-Zubayr. Marwan's partisans, led by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, decisively defeated the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi tribes, led by al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, at the Battle of Marj Rahit in July 684. The surviving Qaysi tribesmen fled to the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) under the leadership of Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, who maintained his recognition of Ibn al-Zubayr's suzerainty. However, in March 685, Ibn al-Zubayr lost the economically important province of Egypt to Marwan.\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations collapsed between Ibn al-Zubayr and the Kufan strongman al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, who afterward took up the cause of the Alid family. He declared Ibn al-Hanafiyya caliph and, unprecedentedly in Islamic history, the \"mahdī\". Al-Mukhtar's partisans drove out the Zubayrid authorities from Kufa in October 685. Al-Mukhtar later dispatched a Kufan force to the Hejaz and freed Ibn al-Hanafiyya. Mus'ab's authority in Basra and Khurasan was also beginning to waver, but was ultimately secured after he gained the backing of the powerful Azdi chieftain and military leader of Khurasan, al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra. Mus'ab also gained the defections of thousands of Kufan tribesmen and together they defeated and killed al-Mukhtar in April 687. Ibn al-Zubayr subsequently dismissed Mus'ab from office in 686/87 and appointed his own son Hamza as governor of Basra. The latter dispatched a force under Abd Allah ibn Umayr al-Laythi to drive out the Najdiyya Kharijites from Bahrayn after they overran the province, but the Zubayrids were repulsed. Hamza proved incompetent in his administration of Iraq and following his failure to deliver the provincial revenues to the state treasury in Mecca, he was dismissed and allegedly imprisoned by his father. Mus'ab was reinstated shortly after, in 687/88. By that year, the Najdiyya Kharijites conquered Yemen and Hadhramawt, while in 689, they occupied Ta'if, Mecca's southern, uphill neighbor.\n\nThe defeat of al-Mukhtar, who had opposed the Zubayrids and the Umayyads, left Ibn al-Zubayr and Marwan's son and successor Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) as the two main contenders for the caliphate. However, Kharijite gains in Arabia had isolated Ibn al-Zubayr in the Hejaz, cutting him off from loyalists in other parts of the caliphate. In 691, Abd al-Malik secured the support of Zufar and the Qays of Jazira, removing the principal obstacle between his Syrian army and Zubayrid Iraq. Later that year, his forces conquered Iraq and killed Mus'ab in the Battle of Maskin. Al-Muhallab, who was leading the fight against the Kharijites in Fars and Ahwaz, subsequently switched his allegiance to Abd al-Malik.\n\nAfter asserting Umayyad authority in Iraq, Abd al-Malik dispatched one of his commanders, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, to subdue Ibn al-Zubayr. Al-Hajjaj besieged and bombarded Mecca for six months, by which point, most of Ibn al-Zubayr's partisans and his sons Khubayb and Hamza surrendered upon offers of pardons. Ibn al-Zubayr remained defiant and, acting on his mother's counsel, entered the battlefield where he was ultimately slain on 3 October or 4 November 692. In an anecdote recorded by 9th-century historian al-Tabari, when al-Hajjaj and his lieutenant commander, Tariq ibn Amr, stood over Ibn al-Zubayr's body, Tariq said of the latter: \"Women have borne none manlier than he ... He had no defensive trench, no fortress, no stronghold; yet he held his own against us an equal, and even got the better of us whenever we met with him\". Al-Hajjaj posted Ibn al-Zubayr's body on a gibbet where it remained until Abd al-Malik allowed Ibn al-Zubayr's mother to retrieve it. His body was subsequently buried in the house of his paternal grandmother Safiyya in Medina. The Umayyad victory and Ibn al-Zubayr's death marked the end of the Second Fitna.\n\nFollowing his victory, Abd al-Malik confiscated the estates of Ibn al-Zubayr in Medina and elsewhere in the Hejaz. The caliph later restored one or more of the properties to Ibn al-Zubayr's sons after a request by Thabit. His eldest son, Khubayb, was flogged to death in Medina by its governor Umar II during the reign of Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Thabit, meanwhile, had gained particular favor from al-Walid's successor, Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 715–717), who agreed to return the remainder of the confiscated estates to Ibn al-Zubayr's sons. Under the Abbasid caliphs al-Mahdi (r. 775–785) and Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), several descendants of Ibn al-Zubayr attained senior administrative posts, including his great-grandson Abd Allah ibn Mus'ab and the latter's son Bakkar ibn Abd Allah, who successively served as governors of Medina.\n\nIbn al-Zubayr adamantly opposed the caliphate becoming an Umayyad inheritance. Instead, he advocated that the caliph should be chosen by \"shūrā\" (consultation) among the Quraysh as a whole. The latter opposed the monopolization of power by the Banu Umayya and insisted power be distributed among all the Qurashi clans. However, other than this conviction, Ibn al-Zubayr did not sponsor any religious doctrine or political program, unlike the contemporary Alid and Kharijite movements. By the time he made his claim to the caliphate, he had emerged as the leader of the disaffected Quraysh. According to historian H. A. R. Gibb, Qurashi resentment towards the Banu Umayya is evident as an underlying theme in the Islamic traditions about Ibn al-Zubayr's conflict with the Umayyads and Ibn al-Zubayr was the \"principal representative\" of the second generation of the Hejaz's elite Muslim families who chafed at the \"gulf of power\" between them and the ruling Umayyad house. Though Gibb describes Ibn al-Zubayr as \"brave, but fundamentally self-seeking and self-indulgent\", the hostility to the Umayyads in traditional Muslim sources led to a general description of him as a \"model of piety\". Nonetheless, a number of Muslim sources condemned him as jealous and harsh and particularly criticized the fatal abuse of his brother 'Amr and his imprisonment of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya.\n\nIbn al-Zubayr rallied opposition to the Umayyads in the Hejaz from his base in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, and through his prestige as a first-generation Muslim with family ties to the prophet Muhammad. He aimed to restore the Hejaz to its former political prominence; after the assassination of Uthman, the region's position as the political center of the Caliphate had been lost first to Kufa under Ali and then to Damascus under Mu'awiya I. To that end, Ibn al-Zubayr developed a strong association with Mecca and its Ka'aba, which, combined with his control of Islam's second holiest city of Medina, furthered his prestige and gave his caliphate a holy character. Ibn al-Zubayr rejected the offer of support from the caliphate's Syria-based army partly because it would have obliged him to relocate to Damascus. Indeed, while other cities were available to him, Ibn al-Zubayr opted to remain in Mecca, from which he issued directives to his supporters elsewhere in the Caliphate. However, this restricted him from exercising direct influence in the larger, more populated provinces, particularly Iraq, where his more worldly brother ruled with virtual independence. In Arabia, Ibn al-Zubayr's power had been largely confined to the Hejaz with the Kharijite leader Najda holding more influence in the greater part of the peninsula. Thus, Ibn al-Zubayr had virtually rendered himself a background figure in the movement that was launched in his name; in the words of historian Julius Wellhausen, \"the struggle turned round him [Ibn al-Zubayr] nominally, but he took no part in it and it was decided without him\".\n\nDuring his rule, Ibn al-Zubayr made significant alterations to the Ka'aba's structure, claiming that the changes were in line with the authority of the prophet Muhammad. He called himself the \"fugitive at the sanctuary [Ka'aba]\" while his Umayyad detractors referred to him as \"the evil-doer at Mecca\".\n\nThree Umayyad caliphs reigned during the twelve years of Ibn al-Zubayr's caliphate between 680 and 692. The short terms indicated in the upper plot in light blue and yellow correspond to the tenures of Mu'awiya II and Marwan I, respectively.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 13, 1997. It was written by Ron Hauge and directed by Dominic Polcino. Bart fraudulently applies for a credit card and uses it to buy an expensive trained dog called Laddie. It guest stars voice actor Frank Welker as Laddie, a parody of Lassie. The episode's title references the novel \"The Caine Mutiny\".\n\nWhen Bart complains he never gets any mail, Marge gives him the family's junk mail. He completes a credit card application under the name of the family dog, Santa's Little Helper. Bart receives a credit card issued to \"Santos L. Halper\" after the company misreads his application. He goes on a spending spree, buying the family expensive gifts from a mail-order catalog: smoked salmon and a radio-frying pan for Marge, a golf shirt for Homer, pep pills for Lisa and several things for himself. Undeterred by its US$1,200 price, Bart orders a purebred collie. When the dog arrives, Bart learns his name is Laddie and he is trained to perform several tasks. The Simpsons fall in love with the new dog and neglect Santa's Little Helper.\n\nWhen he fails to pay his credit card bill, Bart gets a call from a debt collection agency demanding payment. When the calls and collection letters persist, he enlists Laddie's help to bury the ill-gotten card. Soon repo men arrive to confiscate his purchases. When a repossessor asks for the $1,200 dog to be returned, Bart identifies Santa's Little Helper as the dog. The greyhound is herded into the truck and he watches sadly as it drives away.\n\nRealizing Santa's Little Helper is gone, the family bonds with Laddie, except for Bart, who fears for Santa's Little Helper's fate. When an exhausted Bart takes Laddie on one of his frequent walks, the collie saves the life of Baby Gerald. At the ceremony honoring Laddie's heroism, Chief Wiggum decides that he would make the perfect police dog. Bart gives him to the Springfield police force and breaks down crying while explaining to his family why they no longer have any dog at all. Homer instructs him to find Santa's Little Helper. Bart eventually learns from Reverend Lovejoy that the dog was given to a parishioner, Mr. Mitchell.\n\nBart visits Mitchell to beg for his dog back, but he sees that the man is blind because he fails to notice his parrot has died. When Bart hears how the man and Santa's Little Helper have bonded, he grows heartsick and leaves. Later Bart makes a late-night visit to the man's home and retrieves Santa's Little Helper. While trying to escape, he traps himself in a closet after mistaking it for an outside door. Thinking Bart is a burglar, Mitchell gloats that he has called the police. Bart explains that he is just a child and the dog was originally his. Bart and Mitchell call to Santa's Little Helper so he can decide which owner he prefers. After briefly getting distracted by chasing his own tail, Santa's Little Helper chooses Bart. Chief Wiggum arrives with Laddie, who immediately sniffs out a bag of marijuana in Mitchell's pocket. As Bart and Santa's Little Helper head home, more police officers arrive to enjoy the confiscated cannabis.\n\nThe episode uses the full opening sequence because the story ran short. A long sequence was cut from the middle of the episode, with half of the episode being re-written after the animatic had been finished. The main plot of the episode came from an original idea that the family would be issued a credit card in the name \"Hobart Simpson\" which Bart would use. An original subplot was that Lisa would become addicted to \"Trucker's Choice\" pep pills. Originally, instead of going to the dog park, the family took Laddie to a waterfall, where he performed a series of dives. This idea was scrapped since the script already proved that Laddie was a form of \"superdog\". Likewise, the scene where Laddie rescues Baby Gerald was originally more complicated, but it was cut; the finished episode shows only the aftermath of Laddie's rescue.\n\nLaddie was designed to resemble a real dog. The catalog Bart uses is a combination of the \"Lillian Vernon\" catalog and \"The Sharper Image\" store. The opening stemmed from the fact that the show had not had a sequence where the family received mail, and the writers wanted to create a joke about the different types of mail addressed to each family member. After Bart's \"dog burning\" fantasy, when he hears a ship's horn in the distance, there was originally going to be a faint cry of \"more dogs\", but it was deemed taking the joke too far. Hank Azaria ad-libbed the entire sequence during the closing credits in which Chief Wiggum and Lou sing along to \"Jammin'\".\n\nThe title is a reference to the novel and film \"The Caine Mutiny\". The dog Laddie is a riff on Lassie's name, appearance and uncanny intelligence. Marge listens to the song \"You Really Got Me\" by The Kinks on her frying pan radio. At the end of the episode, the song \"Jamming\" by Bob Marley is played. The design of the Repo Depot is based very loosely on the repossession agency from \"Repo Man\". The address of Mr. Mitchell's house, 57 Mt. Auburn Street, is one of addresses of \"The Harvard Lampoon\". Mr. Mitchell's belief that his dead parrot is still alive is a reference to the \"Dead Parrot\" Monty Python sketch.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"The Canine Mutiny\" finished 43rd in ratings for the week of April 7–13, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.1, equivalent to approximately 7.9 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"King of the Hill\", and \"Beverly Hills, 90210\".\n\nThe episode's ending with Chief Wiggum and Lou singing along to \"Jamming'\" by Bob Marley is often cited as one of the best endings in the history of the show. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \"A sweet episode\". Homer's line \"There, there, shut up boy\" is one of Josh Weinstein's favorites.\n\n"}

{"id": "2221172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221172", "title": "Indian Head cent", "text": "Indian Head cent\n\nThe Indian Head cent, also known as an Indian Head penny, was a one-cent coin ($0.01) produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint from 1859 to 1909. It was designed by James Barton Longacre, the Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint.\n\nFrom 1793 to 1857, the cent was a copper coin about the size of a half dollar. The discovery of gold in California caused a large inflation in prices. As gold became more abundant, the price of copper rose. Cent and half-cent manufacture was one of the only profit centers for the Mint and by 1850 the Mint began looking for alternatives. In 1857 the Mint reduced the size of the cent and changed the composition to 12% nickel and 88% copper (copper-nickel), issuing a new design, the Flying Eagle cent. The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents, though thicker. This was the first use of copper-nickel by the United States. The copper-nickel made them look brighter and they began to be called \"White cent\" or \"Nicks\".\n\nIn 1858 the Flying Eagle was replaced with the Indian head design. The Flying Eagle design caused production difficulties and the Mint soon looked to replace it. Mint Director James Ross Snowden selected the Indian Head design and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield. Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the American Civil War when the metal nickel was in short supply. As Mint officials saw that privately issued bronze tokens were circulating, they induced Congress to pass the Coinage Act of 1864, authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy.\n\nIn the postwar period, the cent became very popular and was struck in large numbers in most years. An exception was 1877 when a poor economy and little demand for cents created one of the rarest dates in the series. With the advent of coin-operated machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, even more cents were produced, reaching 100 million for the first time in 1907. In 1909, the Indian Head cent was replaced by the Lincoln cent, designed by Victor D. Brenner.\n\nThe half-dollar-sized large cent was struck from 1793 to 1857. That coin was intended to contain close to a cent's worth of copper, as people expected coins to contain close to their face values in metal. Nevertheless, because of the constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender, the government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments. By the early 1850s, fluctuations in the price of copper led the Mint of the United States to seek alternatives, including reducing the size of the cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper. The result was the Flying Eagle cent, the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and heavier, composed of 88% copper and 12% nickel. The Flying Eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a pattern coin in 1856, then for circulation in 1857 and 1858.\n\nThe Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn Spanish colonial silver coins, which until then had circulated widely in the United States. These \"small cents\" were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced. By 1858, Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production. The high points on both sides of the coin (the eagle's head and the wreath) opposed each other, and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper-nickel alloy. Mint Engraver James B. Longacre, designer of the Flying Eagle cent, was instructed to develop alternative designs. He produced one, showing a slimmer eagle, which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath. Although this would have cured the production problem, the design was not liked. Mint Director James Ross Snowden suggested a head of Columbus as an obverse design, but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin.\nIn 1858, the Mint tested new designs for the cent. Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck, consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse, a \"scrawny eagle\" pattern, and the Indian Head design, mated with four different wreaths for the reverse. Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns; the sets were also sold to collectors. The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April, as on the twelfth of that month, a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that \"I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint [with] a head resembling that of the five dollar piece and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath\", and asking to purchase a specimen. Other numismatists also sought pieces: R. Coulton Davis, a Philadelphia druggist with ties to the Mint, wrote to Snowden in June informing him of a favorable story in a Boston newspaper, and Augustus B. Sage wrote to the Mint Director the same month, asking for a specimen for himself, and one for the newly founded American Numismatic Society.\n\nAccording to Walter Breen, Snowden most likely chose the combination of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, and could be expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.\n\nLongacre advocated his Indian Head design in an August 21, 1858, letter to Snowden:\n\nBy numismatic legend, the facial features of the goddess Liberty on the obverse of the Indian Head cent were based on the features of Longacre's daughter Sarah; the tale runs that she was at the mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting, and her father sketched her. However, Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married in 1858, not 12 as in the tale, and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of \"Crouching Venus\" in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican. He did often sketch his elder daughter, and there are resemblances between the depictions of Sarah and the various representations of Liberty on his coins of the 1850s. These tales were apparently extant at the time, as Snowden, writing to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb in November 1858, denied that the coin was based \"on any human features in the Longacre family\". Lee F. McKenzie, in his 1991 article on Longacre, notes that any artist can be influenced by many things, but calls the story \"essentially false\".\n\nRegardless of who posed for Longacre, the facial features of the \"Indian\" are essentially Caucasian, meaning that a Caucasian woman wears the headdress of a Native American man. Longacre had, in 1854, designed the three-dollar piece with a female with similar features (also supposedly based on the museum sculpture) but a more fanciful headdress, and adapted that design for the gold dollar. Officials were aware of this artistic license at the time of issue; Snowden, in his November 1858 letter to Cobb, characterizes the two earlier coins as \"the artists at the Mint evidently not realizing the absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of the warrior brave on the head of a woman\". Longacre would not be the last to juxtapose the features of a White woman with an Indian headdress reserved for men; Augustus Saint-Gaudens, for the Indian Head eagle (1907), produced a similar design. Later issues depict more accurate Indians, including Bela Lyon Pratt's Indian Head gold pieces (1908), the Buffalo nickel (1913) by James Earle Fraser, who worked from Native American models, and the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar (1926), designed by Fraser and his wife Laura.\nArt historian Cornelius Vermeule had mixed emotions about the Indian Head cent: \"Longacre enriched the mythology of American coinage in a pleasant if unpretentious fashion. Given his pattern half-dollar designs of 1859 as a yardstick, he could have done worse.\" In another comparison, Vermeule suggested, \"far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically, and far less attractive to the eye than the [flying eagle], the Indian head cent was at least to achieve the blessing of popular appeal. The coin became perhaps the most beloved and typically American of any piece great or small in the American series. Great art the coin was not, but it was one of the first products of the United States mints to achieve the common touch.\"\n\nProduction of the Indian Head cent for commerce began at the start of 1859. As issued for circulation, the pieces differ in some particulars from the pattern 1858 cent of similar design; Longacre sharpened some details. The pattern coin had the laurel leaves in the reverse wreath in bunches of five leaves; the issued 1859 cent has them in bunches of six. Cents dated 1858 with the adopted reverse (with six-leaf bunches) are known, were most likely struck in 1859, and are extremely rare.\n\nIn 1860, the reverse of the cent was changed to feature an oak wreath and a narrow shield; such reverses are also known on 1859-dated pieces struck as patterns. According to Richard Snow in his guidebook to Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents, this was not due to problems with the \"Laurel Wreath\" reverse design used in 1859, as full details survive on many extant pieces. Walter Breen, however, suggested that the feathers and curls on the obverse did not strike as well as they would later, and that \"this may account for Snowden's decision to change the design again\". David Lange, in his history of the Mint, states that it was to give the coin, quoting Snowden, \"more National character\". All 1859 cents and some from 1860 have the cutoff of Liberty's bust on the obverse end with a point; most 1860 cents and all later issues have it rounded.\n\nTens of millions of Flying Eagle cents had been issued in exchange for the old American coppers and small Spanish silver. The Spanish silver was still flowing into the Mint in early 1859 and, at Snowden's urging, Congress on March 3 of that year extended the redemption of these foreign coins, legal tender in the US until 1857, for another two years. Neil Carothers, in his work on small-denomination currency, challenged this decision as unnecessary—deprived of legal tender status, the remaining Spanish silver would have been eliminated through sales to banks for their bullion. Those who brought the old coins to the Mint received cents for them, at first Flying Eagle, and then Indian Head. In the year following the renewal, some forty million Indian Head cents were issued, meaning nearly a hundred million copper-nickel cents had entered commerce since 1857. As the coin did not circulate in the South and West due to prejudice against base-metal money, they choked commerce. No one had to take them; no law made them legal tender. At Snowden's urging Congress in June 1860 ended the exchange. Nevertheless, as Snowden admitted in his annual report that year, there were too many cents in circulation. In October 1860, \"The Bankers' Magazine and Statistical Register\" reported that there were ten million cents in commerce in New York City above what was needed, and if anyone wished to order in bulk, they could be purchased at a discount.\n\nThe surplus of cents was relieved by the economic chaos engendered by the American Civil War, which began in 1861. At the end of that year, the banks stopped paying out gold, which thereafter commanded a premium over paper money. These greenbacks, beginning in the following year, were issued in large quantities by the federal government. Silver vanished from commerce in June 1862, as the price of that metal rose, leaving the cent the sole federal coin that had not entirely vanished from commerce through hoarding. The glut of cents had by then abated, as merchants had stored them away in quantity—one New York City floor collapsed beneath the load. There were other means of making change which passed in the emergency, from postage stamps to privately issued tokens, but the public demand was for the cent—the Philadelphia Mint struck record numbers, and set aside part of the production to be transmitted to other cities. Nevertheless, by July 1862, the cent, in quantity, could only be purchased at a premium of 4% in paper money in major cities in the East. The copper-nickel pieces were nicknamed \"nickels\", or \"nicks\". Presentation of coins in payment carried with it no obligation to make change in the same. Accordingly, with a small quantity of \"nicks\", a shopper could make purchases with exact change, without receiving such makeshifts as merchants' credit slips, that others might not accept at the stated value.\n\nBy 1863, \"The Bankers' Magazine\" reported that the premium for cents in Philadelphia had risen to 20%. Thereafter, the premium decreased as there was a flood of metal tokens issued by merchants, which were widely accepted. Other war expedients, such as fractional currency, lessened the demand for the cent by taking the place of missing silver coinage. Small quantities of cents circulated among them, though many were still hoarded.\n\nGovernment officials saw that the public readily accepted the merchant tokens. Many of these tokens were made of bronze, and when, in 1863, they attempted to restore coins to circulation, the use of bronze coins, which would not contain their face values in metal, was considered. In his annual report submitted October 1, 1863, Lincoln Administration Mint Director James Pollock noted that \"whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins, they merely want the inferior [base metal] money for convenience in making exact payments\". He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained as little as a fifth of a cent in metal, yet had still circulated. He proposed that the copper-nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size. Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery. On December 8, Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, proposing a bronze cent and two-cent piece.\nOn March 2, 1864, Pollock wrote urgently to Chase, warning him that the Mint was running out of nickel and that demand for cents was at an all-time high. He also informed the Secretary that the United States Assay Commission, composed of citizens and officials who had met the previous month to test the nation's silver and gold coinage, had recommended the use of French bronze (95% copper with the remainder tin and zinc) as a coinage metal for the cent and a new two-cent piece. Three days later, Chase sent Pollock's December letter and draft legislation for bronze one- and two-cent pieces to Maine Senator William P. Fessenden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Fessenden took no immediate action, and on March 16, Pollock wrote again to Chase, warning that the Mint was going to run out of nickel, much of which was imported. Chase forwarded his letter to Fessenden. Legislation was finally introduced by New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark on March 22; Pollock's letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as the Senate passed the bill without debate.\n\nThe domestic supply of nickel was at that time produced by a mine at Gap, Pennsylvania, owned by industrialist Joseph Wharton. On March 19, Pollock wrote to Chase that they had no more nickel, nor was any available from overseas; \"we are thus shut up to the home supply; from the works of Mr. Wharton\". Opposed to the removal of nickel from the cent, Wharton published a pamphlet in April 1864 proposing coinage of one-, two-, three-, five-, and ten-cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper, doubling the percentage of nickel used in the cent. Despite Wharton's efforts, on April 20, a select committee of the House of Representatives endorsed the bill. It was opposed by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, who represented the mining area from which Wharton extracted his nickel. Wharton had spent $200,000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery, Stevens related, and it was unfair to deprive him of the major use of his metal. \"Shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to the government?\" Besides, he argued, the copper-nickel alloy for the cent had been approved by Congress, and the new metal, which he termed \"brass\", would show rust. He was rebutted by Iowa Congressman John A. Kasson, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, who stated that the bronze alloy did not resemble brass, and he could not support the proposition that the government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales.\n\nThe legislation passed the House, and the Coinage Act of 1864 was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on April 22, 1864. The legislation made base metal coins legal tender for the first time: both cents and two-cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten. The government would not, however, redeem them in bulk. The act also outlawed the private one- and two-cent tokens, and later that year Congress abolished all such issues. The legislation did not allow for the redemption of the old copper-nickel cents; it had been drafted by Pollock, who was hoping that the seignorage income from issuing the new coins would help finance Mint operations, and he did not want it reduced by the recall of the old pieces. Wharton and his interests were appeased by the passage of a bill for a three-cent piece in 1865 and a five-cent piece in 1866, both of his proposed alloy, out of which the \"nickel\", as the latter coin has come to be known, is still struck. Despite this, Wharton and his nickel interests made repeated attempts to return nickel to the cent, each time failing, both as part of the deliberations over what became the Coinage Act of 1873, and in the early 1880s.\n\nThe copper-nickel cents from early in 1864 were generally bought up by speculators and did not circulate in large numbers. The Mint began producing bronze cents on May 13, three weeks after the passage of the Coinage Act, and they were released into circulation on May 20. Dies prepared for copper-nickel pieces were used to strike bronze. Sometime during 1864, Longacre sharpened his design for use in striking the softer bronze pieces, and also added his initial \"L\". It is not known when this was done; it may have been as early as May, with the new dies used alongside the old. These bronze pieces are often referred to as \"1864-L\" and \"1864 No L\". The \"L\" is known on 1863-dated pieces, in both metals, and on 1864-dated copper-nickel pieces—some of these issues, all extremely rare, were likely struck at a later date. The bronze cent was immediately accepted by the public, and heavy production of the issue soon alleviated the shortage of cents.\n\nIn the postwar years, the heavy production of cents was scaled back, as hoarding ceased and some of the slack was taken up by other base-metal coins. Nevertheless, the various issues of small coins, at that time not redeemed by the government, caused another glut in commerce, which was not completely broken until the Act of March 3, 1871, allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of $20 or more. Pursuant to this act, over thirty million copper-nickel cents, of both the Indian Head and Flying Eagle designs, were redeemed; the Mint melted these for recoinage. Fifty-five million bronze cents were also sold to the government; beginning in 1874, the Mint re-issued these in response to commercial requests for cents, lowering the demand for new coins. Drops in the price of silver brought coins of that metal, hoarded for a decade or more, back into commerce, also decreasing demand. Between 1866 and 1878, production only occasionally exceeded ten million; the 1877 coin, with a circulation mintage of 852,500, is a rare date for the series. After 1881, there were few redemptions of bronze cents, due to high demand for the denomination, though copper-nickel cents continued to be redeemed and melted.\n\nWith the discontinuance of the two-cent piece and three-cent silver in 1873, the cent and the three-cent nickel were the sole survivors of the coins valued at less than five cents. The three-cent nickel, by this time, was unpopular because of its odd denomination and (with the return of silver coinage) its similarity in size to the dime. A three-cent postage rate had been one of the reasons why that denomination had begun, in the 1850s; in the early 1880s, the Post Office decreased the basic rate for letters to two cents. This change both increased demand for cents, and decreased the demand for the three-cent nickel, which was abolished in 1890. In most years of the 1880s, there were large issues of Indian Head cents. The exception was in the mid-1880s when poor economic times led to less demand for minor coins. No cents or five-cent nickels were minted after February 1885 until near the end of 1886. Production of undated dies into which the year of issue could be punched did continue, and during the hiatus in coin production, Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber modified the design, removing light outlines between the lettering on the obverse and the rest of the design, and making other changes. This led to two types for the 1886 Indian Head cent, which may be distinguished: on the Type I, the lowest feather on the obverse points between the I and the C in \"AMERICA\", while on the Type II it points between the C and the final A. Snow estimates that 14 million of the mintage of 17,654,290 were Type I, as were a majority of the 4,290 proof strikings.\n\nThe economic Panic of 1893 again caused a decrease in the number of cents produced, as coins accumulated in private hands were spent, creating a surplus. Aside from that, the final years of the series before its termination in 1909 were marked by large mintages, with 1907 topping the hundred million mark. A healthy economy in most years fueled demand, as did the increasing popularity of coin-operated machines, some of which could be found at penny arcades. By the early 20th century, the cent was accepted across the nation, but by law production of the cent was limited to the Philadelphia Mint. Treasury officials sought removal of this restriction, and for an increase in the annual appropriation to purchase base metals for production of the cent and nickel—the amount expended had remained the same since 1873, although demand for cents had greatly increased. By the Act of April 24, 1906, the Mint received permission to strike base metal coins at any mint, and the appropriation was quadrupled to $200,000. Small quantities of cents were struck at the San Francisco Mint in 1908 and 1909; the 1909-S cent, with a mintage of 309,000 pieces, is the lowest mintage of the series and commands a premium as a key date.\n\nCongress passed legislation in 1890 allowing the Mint to alter designs that had been in use for 25 years without the need for legislative authorization. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw, complaining that U.S. coinage lacked artistic merit, and enquiring if it would be possible to engage a private artist, such as sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, to prepare new coin designs. At Roosevelt's instructions, the Mint hired Saint-Gaudens to redesign the cent and the four gold pieces: the double eagle ($20), eagle ($10), half eagle ($5), and quarter eagle ($2.50). As the designs of those pieces had remained the same for 25 years, they could be changed without an act of Congress, as could the Indian Head cent.\nSaint-Gaudens originally conceived a flying eagle design for the cent, but at Roosevelt's request, developed it for the $20 piece after learning that under the 1873 act, an eagle could not appear on the cent. Writer and friend Witter Bynner recalled that in January 1907, Saint-Gaudens was seriously ill with cancer, and was carried to his studio for ten minutes a day to critique the work of his assistants on current projects, including the cent. Saint-Gaudens died on August 3, 1907, without having submitted another design for the cent.\n\nWith the redesign of the four gold denominations completed by 1908, Roosevelt turned his attention to the cent. The centenary of the birth of assassinated president Abraham Lincoln would occur in February 1909, and large numbers of privately manufactured souvenirs were already being issued. Many citizens had written to the Treasury Department, proposing a Lincoln coin, and Roosevelt was interested in honoring his fellow Republican. This was a break with previous American numismatic tradition; before the Lincoln cent, no regularly circulating U.S. coin had featured an actual person (as opposed to idealized personifications, as of \"liberty\").\n\nIn late 1908, Roosevelt sat for sculptor Victor David Brenner, who was designing a medal for the Panama Canal Commission. It is uncertain how Brenner was selected to design the coin, but in January 1909, Mint Director Frank A. Leach hired him to design a Lincoln cent. This went into circulation later in 1909, putting an end to the Indian Head cent series.\n\nIndian Head cents were popular among coin collectors even in the half-century when they were produced; since then, with the growth of the hobby, interest has increased. The 1930s introduction of inexpensive coin albums to house the series and encourage collectors to seek a complete set came at a time when the bronze version of the Indian Head cent was still common in pocket change. They were not widely studied until the 1960s; numismatic writer Tom DeLorey, in his introduction to Snow's book, ascribes this to prejudice among numismatists who grew up with the Indian Head cent as a common circulation piece. He notes that the 1960 edition of R.S. Yeoman's \"A Guide Book of United States Coins\" (commonly, the \"Red Book\") listed only four dates for which there were varieties, one of which, the overdate 1869/68 was in error, as the final digit was actually over another 9. The 2018 edition of the \"Red Book\" lists varieties for 12 dates.\n\nLike most other denominations of U.S. coins, the 1873 may be found in two varieties, depending on the appearance of the final digit of the date: the \"Close 3\" or \"Closed 3\" is from early dies, but after Chief Coiner A. Loudon Snowden complained that the \"3\" looked too much like an \"8\", Chief Engraver William Barber modified his work to create the \"Open 3\". Some 1875 pieces have a dot appearing on the letter \"N\" in \"ONE\" on the reverse. This may have been a secret mark, added to catch a thief within the Philadelphia Mint.\n\nThe Indian Head cent was struck in large quantities and most dates remain inexpensive: Yeoman lists all dates from 1900 to 1908 from Philadelphia at $2 in Good-4 condition. The record holder for the denomination is a proof specimen of the 1864-L, of which there were an estimated 20 struck; it sold for $161,000 in 2012.\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

Such a multi-component system is considered a solution rather than a compound when the crystal structure of the solvent remains unchanged by addition of the solutes, and when the chemical components remain in a single homogeneous phase. This often happens when the two elements (generally metals) involved are close together on the periodic table; conversely, a chemical compound generally results when two metals involved are not near each other on the periodic table.\n\nThe solid solution needs to be distinguished from mechanical mixtures of powdered solids like two salts, sugar and salt, etc. The mechanical mixtures have total or partial miscibility gap in solid state.\nExamples of solid solutions include crystallized salts from their liquid mixture, metal alloys and moist solids. In the case of metal alloys intermetallic compounds occur frequently.\n\nThe solute may incorporate into the solvent crystal lattice \"substitutionally\", by replacing a solvent particle in the lattice, or \"interstitially\", by fitting into the space between solvent particles. Both of these types of solid solution affect the properties of the material by distorting the crystal lattice and disrupting the physical and electrical homogeneity of the solvent material.\n\nSome mixtures will readily form solid solutions over a range of concentrations, while other mixtures will not form solid solutions at all. The propensity for any two substances to form a solid solution is a complicated matter involving the chemical, crystallographic, and quantum properties of the substances in question. Substitutional solid solutions, in accordance with the Hume-Rothery rules, may form if the solute and solvent have:\n\nThe phase diagram in \"Fig. 1\" displays an alloy of two metals which forms a solid solution at all relative concentrations of the two species. In this case, the pure phase of each element is of the same crystal structure, and the similar properties of the two elements allow for unbiased substitution through the full range of relative concentrations.\n\nSolid solutions have important commercial and industrial applications, as such mixtures often have superior properties to pure materials. Many metal alloys are solid solutions. Even small amounts of solute can affect the electrical and physical properties of the solvent.\n\nThe binary phase diagram in \"Fig. 2\" shows the phases of a mixture of two substances in varying concentrations, formula_1 and formula_2. The region labeled \"formula_3\" is a solid solution, with formula_2 acting as the solute in a matrix of formula_1. On the other end of the concentration scale, the region labeled \"formula_6\" is also a solid solution, with formula_1 acting as the solute in a matrix of formula_2. The large solid region in between the formula_3 and formula_6 solid solutions, labeled \"formula_3 + formula_6\", is \"not\" a solid solution. Instead, an examination of the microstructure of a mixture in this range would reveal two phases—solid solution formula_1-in-formula_2 and solid solution formula_2-in-formula_1 would form separate phases, perhaps lamella or grains.\n\nIn the phase diagram, at three different concentrations, the material will be solid until its heated to its melting point, and then (after adding the heat of fusion) become liquid at that same temperature:\n\nAt other proportions, the material will enter a mushy or pasty phase until it warms up to being completely melted.\n\nThe mixture at the dip point of the diagram is called a eutectic alloy. Lead-tin mixtures formulated at that point (37/63 mixture) are useful when soldering electronic components, particularly if done manually, since the solid phase is quickly entered as the solder cools. In contrast, when lead-tin mixtures were used to solder seams in automobile bodies a pasty state enabled a shape to be formed with a wooden paddle or tool, so a 70-30 lead to tin ratio was used. (Lead is being removed from such applications owing to its toxicity and consequent difficulty in recycling devices and components that include lead.)\n\nWhen a solid solution becomes unstable—due to a lower temperature, for example—exsolution occurs and the two phases separate into distinct microscopic to megascopic lamellae. This is mainly caused by difference in cation size. Cations which have a large difference in radii are not likely to readily substitute.\n\nTake the alkali feldspar minerals for example, whose end members are albite, NaAlSiO and microcline, KAlSiO. At high temperatures Na and K readily substitute for each other and so the minerals will form a solid solution, yet at low temperatures albite can only substitute a small amount of K and the same applies for Na in the microcline. This leads to exsolution where they will separate into two separate phases. In the case of the alkali feldspar minerals, thin white albite layers will alternate between typically pink microcline, resulting in a perthite texture.\n\n\n\n"}

She was best known for her time with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and for her appearance on \"\".\n\nMassaro made her debut in WWE after winning the WWE Diva Search in 2005. She was firstly incorporated into the Raw brand where she had her first wrestling feud against Vince's Devils (a villainous female stable) while she also aligned herself with Trish Stratus in the process to defeat the team. With Stratus, she was involved in another feud with the then debuting Mickie James who was obsessed with Stratus and was jealous of Ashley's friendship with her, attacking and causing her to lose matches. She was later drafted to SmackDown! and became the valet for the WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Her most high-profile matches were a WWE Women's Championship match against Melina at WrestleMania 23 and a \"Playboy Bunnymania\" Lumberjill match at WrestleMania XXIV.\n\nShe left WWE in mid-2008. During her tenure in the company, she had appeared on the covers of several magazines, including the April 2007 issue of \"Playboy\", and has also made an appearance on television and in music videos. In addition, Massaro spent the last two years of her life working as a radio DJ for 94.3 The Shark.\n\nMassaro initially found out about World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) 2005 Raw Diva Search when she met a WWE casting director during a swimsuit pageant. After beating the seven other chosen finalists, Massaro was declared the winner on the episode of \"Raw\" which aired on Monday, August 15, 2005. Her winnings included $250,000 and a one-year contract with WWE.\n\nA week later on the August 22, 2005, episode of \"Raw\", Candice Michelle and Torrie Wilson attacked Massaro after pretending to welcome her to the brand. Massaro's storyline feud with Wilson and Michelle continued over the next couple weeks, as the duo, along with their enforcer Victoria (dubbed as the \"Skankateers\" by commentator Jim Ross), made things difficult for Massaro. Massaro made her in-ring debut on the August 29 episode of \"Raw\", in a losing effort to Victoria. On the September 5 episode of \"Raw\", Massaro was defeated by Wilson due to interference from Victoria and Candice. Massaro evened the score on the September 12 episode of \"Raw\" when she brought out the returning Trish Stratus (who then turned face), and the duo proceeded to attack them. On the September 18 episode of \"Raw\", The pair defeated the trio—who became known as the Ladies in Pink (and later Vince's Devils). This led to a tag team match at Unforgiven, where the team of Stratus and Massaro defeated Wilson and Victoria. The following night on \"Raw\", Massaro accompanied Trish where she defeated Wilson. After the match, The duo were attacked by The Vince Devils. The feud continued into \"WWE Homecoming\", where Stratus and Massaro defeated Wilson, Candice, and Victoria in the first ever three on two Bra and Panties match by stripping all three of their opponents. Massaro continued to wrestle matches through the rest of 2005 and was involved in the annual Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal at Taboo Tuesday for her first shot at the WWE Women's Championship. Massaro eliminated Candice Michelle before being eliminated by Victoria.\nOn January 8, 2006, at New Year's Revolution, Massaro won the first ever Bra and Panties Gauntlet match by being the final wrestler left still wearing her clothes. Following WWE tradition, to please the fans, she removed them herself before making her exit. Through the early part of this year, Massaro became the victim of a series of attacks from Mickie James. At Royal Rumble on January 29, James defeated Massaro with then Women's Champion, Trish Stratus, as the special guest referee. Massaro got her revenge one week later by pinning James in the rematch on \"Raw\". On the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", however, Massaro suffered a fractured left fibula while being eliminated from the Women's Battle Royal, and her feud with James was cut short. She underwent surgery to insert a five-inch metal plate and eight screws into her leg. During her recovery, Massaro still occasionally appeared on \"Raw\" as part of the Stratus/James feud, albeit in a non-active role. Massaro returned on the March 20 episode of \"Raw\", being kidnapped by James to lure Stratus in to saving her but James was successful and attacked Stratus.\n\nMassaro returned to television on June 2, this time on \"SmackDown!\", as a special guest commentator during the Kristal Marshall versus Jillian Hall match. On the edition of June 9 of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro defeated Kristal, Jillian Hall and Michelle McCool in a bikini contest. Massaro later aligned herself with Hall, and they feuded with McCool and Marshall. Massaro won her \"SmackDown!\" debut match on July 21, when she teamed up with Hall to defeat McCool and Marshall. At The Great American Bash, Massaro won the Fatal Four-Way bra and panties match by removing all of her opponents' clothing. On the edition of August 4 of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro broke her knuckle in a match against Marshall.\nMassaro, Paul London, and Brian Kendrick defeated Idol Stevens, KC James and Michelle McCool in a Six-Person Mixed Tag Team match. Following the victory, Massaro became the valet for London and Kendrick, accompanying them to the ring for their matches on \"SmackDown!\" and pay-per-views. On the October 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro participated in a \"Trick or Treat Battle Royal\" which was won by Kristal. On the edition of December 19 of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro teamed up with Layla in a winning effort defeating Jillian Hall and Kristal in a tag-team match. On the edition of January 2 of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro competed against Hall in a winning effort. On the January 26 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro teamed up with London and Kendrick in a losing effort to the MNM (Mercury & Nitro & Melina) in a six-person mixed-tag-team match. During the edition of February 16, 2007 of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro unveiled her \"Playboy\" cover. Surrounding the release of the magazine, Massaro engaged in a feud with Jillian Hall, who was envious of the attention Massaro received due to the \"Playboy\" cover. At No Way Out, Massaro won the first ever Diva Invitational by removing her top to reveal her breasts which were covered with \"Playboy\" bunny pasties.\n\nMassaro also began a feud with then WWE Women's Champion, \"Raw's\" Melina, who was angry over the publicity Massaro had been receiving because of the cover. On the March 9 episode of \"SmackDown!\", the rivalry was taken to the next level when a catfight broke out on the inaugural edition of \"Miz TV\". On the March 16 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Ashley teamed up with London and Kendrick in a losing effort to the MNM (Mercury & Nitro & Melina) in a six-person mixed-tag-team match. On the March 23 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro would get a catfight after Melina attempted to make an interference during Kendrick and Paul's match with MNM. On the March 26 episode of \"Raw\", Massaro teamed up with Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle in a winning effort defeating Melina, Hall and Victoria. At WrestleMania 23, Massaro unsuccessfully challenged Melina for the WWE Women's Championship in a LumberJill match to retain her title.\n\nAfter WrestleMania, Massaro continued as a valet for WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In storyline, on the April 13 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro was attacked by Jillian Hall. In reality, Massaro had loosened a screw in her ankle, which had been inserted the previous year after she legitimately fractured her tibia and fibula while in a battle royal. Massaro returned on the June 1, 2007, episode of \"SmackDown!\", helping McCool defeat Hall after she distracted her. This return was short lived when on the edition of June 8 of \"SmackDown!\", Massaro was suspended indefinitely after accidentally spilling Vince McMahon's coffee on him. In reality, Massaro was taking time off to participate on the show \"Survivor\".\n\nMassaro returned on January 7, 2008 to the Raw brand, winning a Lingerie Pillow Fight against Maria, Jillian Hall, Melina, and Mickie James. On the January 14 episode of \"Raw\", Massaro teamed up with Mickie James and Maria in a losing effort to the team of Beth Phoenix, Jillian Hall, and Melina in a 6 person-tag-team match. Massaro began a storyline with Maria and Santino Marella on the January 21, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", attempting to convince Maria to pose for \"Playboy\" but was interrupted by Marella. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Massaro again attempted to convince Maria by telling her that Hugh Hefner wanted her to pose for \"Playboy\" before Maria could answer Marella interrupted and objected to the proposal. Massaro would then beat down Marella's surprise Big Dick Johnson when he attempted to perform a striptease. At the No Way Out pay-per-view, Massaro would appear with Maria in a segment at the Playboy Mansion. On the March 24, 2008, episode of \"Raw\", Massaro interfered in the match between Maria and Melina. After the match, Santino Marella came down to the ring, so Jerry \"The King\" Lawler (who was tired of Marella's actions over previous weeks) knocked Santino out of the ring. Which set up the six-person mixed-tag-team match, in which they lost to Marella, Melina and Phoenix. On March 30, 2008, Massaro replaced Candice Michelle, who was out with an injury, in the \"Playboy Bunnymania\" Lumberjack match at WrestleMania XXIV teaming up with Maria, losing to Beth Phoenix and Melina after the interference from Marella.\n\nOn the April 14 episode of \"Raw\", Massaro teamed up with Maria in a losing effort to the team of Melina and Hall in a tag-team match. Massaro also participated in a 12 wrestler Tag Team match at Backlash, where Phoenix pinned her to get the win for her team. On the April 28 episode of \"Raw\", Massaro competed in her last match by teaming up with Michelle McCool, Cherry, Kelly Kelly, Maria and James in a winning effort defeating Layla, Melina, Phoenix, Natalya, Hall and Victoria. Massaro was released from her WWE contract on July 9, 2008. A week prior to her release, she announced that she had asked to be let go from her contract due to her daughter being sick.\n\nIn September 2017, Massaro made a brief return to professional wrestling by competing in Zero1 Professional Wrestling USA with former WWE Diva Jillian Hall.\n\nMassaro was a contestant on CBS's \"\", which was the fifteenth season of the show, in 2007. Massaro approached the WWE with the idea of doing the show, and after going through the casting process, she found out she made the show ten days before she had to leave for China to film. Prior to the experience, Massaro had never been camping before, so to train for the show she had to get used to being out in nature. She was assigned to the Zhan Hu tribe in the first episode and quickly began quarreling with fellow contestant Dave Cruser. In the second episode, Massaro was voted off after six days with a 6–1 vote.\n\nMassaro competed in Miss Hawaiian Tropic pageants and was crowned Miss Hawaiian Tropic USA in 2002 and Miss Hawaiian Tropic Canada in August 2004. Massaro appeared in \"FHM\", \"Stuff\", \"Maxim\", and on the cover of \"Playboy\" after joining WWE, though she had previously posed for \"Playboy\" in 2003 and 2004. Massaro tried out for \"Playboy\" scouts when they were searching for models for the 50th Anniversary Playmate Hunt. She appeared in the accompanying pictorial in the December 2003. In addition, she appeared in both \"Femme Fatales\" and \"Flex\" magazines. Massaro also hosted several E! channel \"Wild On!\" episodes and appeared on \"Breaking Bonaduce\" as Danny Bonaduce's personal trainer. Massaro guest starred on an episode of \"\" alongside WWE wrestlers John Cena and Batista. In addition, she appeared in campaign ads for both Hawaiian Tropic and Yamaha.\n\nIn February 2007, Massaro and Glenn \"Kane\" Jacobs filmed an episode of the CW's \"Smallville\" that aired on March 22, 2007. In April 2007, Massaro also appeared as a guest on Fuse TV's show \"The Sauce\". On April 20, 2007, Massaro and several other wrestlers filmed Timbaland's video, \"Throw It on Me\" featuring the Hives. In 2008, she appeared in Rev Theory's video for \"Hell Yeah.\"\n\nMassaro appeared in two WWE video games. She made her in-game debut in \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008\" and in \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009\".\n\nOn June 30, 2018, Massaro began working as a radio DJ for Long Island station 94.3 The Shark where she originally worked the Saturday portion from 10 am to 3 pm. A couple weeks prior to her death in May 2019, she just got promoted to hosting the station's afterdark program on Wednesday nights.\n\nMassaro grew up in Babylon, New York, where her brother and father competed in amateur wrestling. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Communication with a minor in Business from the State University of New York at Albany.\n\nMassaro had one daughter named Alexa. When her daughter became sick in mid-2008, Massaro asked for an early release from WWE to care for her. On May 22, 2019, after Massaro's death, several former WWE female wrestlers who were Massaro's coworkers, grouped as \"The Squared Circle Sisters\", opened a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe in order to create a college fund for Massaro's daughter, setting a goal of $100,000.\n\nShe had several tattoos, including a black and pink nautical star on the back of both of her elbows; a pink and red dragon surrounding kanji lettering that translates to 'Trust No One' going down the right side of her torso; symbols on the small of her lower back; and a butterfly on her right hip. She also had several piercings, including a Monroe (a piercing near the upper lip that resembles a beauty mark) and snakebites (a piercing on each side of the lower lip).\n\nIn November 2016, Massaro joined a class action lawsuit against WWE, litigated by Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against them, alleging that the company concealed risks of injury that caused them neurological damage. Massaro also alleged that she was sexually assaulted at a US military base during a WWE tour of Kuwait and that WWE apologized but persuaded her to not report it to the appropriate authorities. The lawsuit was dismissed in late 2018. After her death, WWE said they received an email from Massaro in October 2018 in which she expressed regret for having taken part in the lawsuit. An affidavit by Massaro describing the sexual abuse allegations in detail was released by the law firm that represented her after her death. WWE would later answer to the allegations described in the affidavit by saying they were not informed about anything of this.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, Massaro, after finishing replying to fanmail, did not show up at 94.3 The Shark for work which caused one of the DJs who was working that night to fill in for her. Hours later, paramedics responded to a rescue call made at 5:23 am when authorities discovered Massaro unresponsive inside her Long Island home. By the time they arrived at the hospital, she was pronounced dead on May 16, 2019, ten days before her 40th birthday.\n\nOn May 19 at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view event, WWE paid tribute to Massaro's life and career by projecting a graphic of her at the start of the show. Visitation for Massaro was held that day, and her funeral took place the following day on May 20 at the Branch Funeral Home in Smithtown, New York.\n\nOn May 21, she was buried at the Saint James Episcopal Church Cemetery in St. James, New York. Also on May 21, TMZ reported that Massaro's cause of death was due to an apparent suicide by hanging. As of June 2019, the Suffolk County medical examiner's office had yet to release an official cause of death due to a New York law concerning privacy issues.\n\nMassaro was going to take part in a suicide prevention music video by her 94.3 The Shark co-worker Brian Orlando who recorded the song with Brandon B. Brown, Vinnie Dombroski and Kevin Martin from Wheatus, Sponge and Candlebox respectively. Orlando scrapped the video in the wake of her death because he did not feel comfortable releasing the song.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221234", "title": "Dawn Tinsley", "text": "Dawn Tinsley\n\nDawn Tinsley is a fictional character in the BBC sitcom \"The Office\", played by Lucy Davis. She is a receptionist for Wernham Hogg paper merchants. Her counterpart in the American version of the show is Pam Beesly. She is also the inspiration for Laetitia Kadiri in the French version of the show, \"Le Bureau\", and Anne Viens in the Québécois version, \"La Job\".\n\nDespite her engagement, it is apparent that she is attracted to senior sales representative Tim Canterbury, and he to her.\n\nShe resigns towards the end of the second series to move with fiancé Lee to Florida to stay with Lee's sister's family.\n\nHer story continues in the Christmas Specials when the documentary producers pay for her and Lee to fly back to the UK to attend the Christmas party and reunion, set three years after the end of series two. She finally leaves Lee for the long-suffering Tim, after he encourages her to hold on to her dream of being a children's book illustrator, an ambition which Lee sought to put down at every opportunity.\n\nLee (Joel Beckett) has been Dawn's boyfriend since school, and as of the first series, her fiancé for three years. Lee proposed through an ad in the paper rather than in person. Dawn comments that she believes he had to pay by the letter, as the ad merely reads \"Lee love Dawn. Marriage?\" She sheds positive light on this by commenting that it's rare to find something romantic and thrifty.\n\nLee's relationship with Dawn is constantly problematic, even though she stays with him up until the end of the series. Lee is essentially portrayed as a reasonable man and logical, dependable partner. However he is seen to be sexist and ungrateful towards Dawn; during one episode, he tells his coworkers in the factory that she will \"take her milkers out for a tenner\", upsetting both Dawn and Tim. He is also often cold and unsympathetic, and doesn't support Dawn's ambition. In The Quiz, Lee discusses plans for their future, citing that they will get married at a register office to save money and move in with his parents to save on rent. His plans for Dawn include her becoming first a mother, then probably a cleaner. He also apparently lacks a sense of humour, even trumping on a prank perpetrated by Tim on Gareth.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Lee is also behind Dawn abandoning her dream to become an illustrator. In the second series she reveals that he pushed her to get a full-time job, which meant she was unable to work as an illustrator anymore. In the final episode of the show, his reason for Dawn to abandon being an illustrator becomes clearer, insensitively stating that in order to be an illustrator \"you got to be good.\"\n\nDawn seems to stay with Lee out of habit and loyalty, and fear of being lonely. However, in the final episode of the show, Dawn breaks off her engagement to Lee and begins a relationship with Tim Canterbury.\n\nTim and Dawn are close friends, but obviously have deeper feelings for one another. Tim and Dawn's relationship is also seen to be very flirtatious at times. However, Dawn's engagement to Lee prevents them from becoming more than friends for quite some time.\n\nTheir friendship seems to suffer after the episode Training, in which Dawn and Lee are having problems. Tim consoles her throughout the episode, but mistakenly comes to the conclusion that Lee and Dawn have split. He then asks Dawn out on a date in front of everyone, where she tells him that she and Lee are still together. Embarrassed, Tim insists he was just asking her out as a friend.\n\nDuring the second series Dawn and Tim remain friends, but don't seem to be as close anymore. Tim starts to take his job more seriously after being promoted and becomes somewhat distant towards Dawn at first. Tim also begins to date Rachel, one of the former Swindon employees, and Dawn grows jealous (along with Gareth, who claims he had feelings for Rachel before Tim and doesn't understand why she wants to go out with someone who looks like a Fisher Price Man).\n\nIn the fifth episode of the second series, Dawn is selling kisses for Red Nose Day. After Tim makes a contribution, they share a kiss. Tim is then driven to choose between Rachel and Dawn, unaware of Dawn and Lee's plans to move to America.\n\nIn the next episode he makes his decision, breaking up with Rachel. Tim soon discovers that Dawn is leaving for Florida with Lee. Initially Tim seems reluctant to say anything, but changes his mind during an interview with the camera crew and runs to tell Dawn how he feels. Their conversation is kept private as Tim takes off his microphone, but he emerges unsuccessful and admits Dawn said no. The second series ends with Dawn and Tim depressed.\n\nThree years pass, with Tim remaining content in his job at Wernham-Hogg and Dawn existing unhappily with Lee in Florida. When asked if they would fly back to Slough for a Christmas reunion, Dawn hesitates and explains that that would cost \"three months of wages\", so the camera crew intervenes by offering to pay for the flight and lodgings. Dawn and Lee are flown back for the reunion, and she briefly resumes her friendship with Tim. When Dawn receives a Christmas present from Tim (some paints with the note 'never give up' written on the sketch that Dawn had drawn for him earlier that day) encouraging her to hold on to her ambition of becoming an illustrator, she leaves Lee and returns to the Christmas party, where she and Tim kiss and finally become a couple.\n"}

{"id": "2221238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221238", "title": "Jack Palladino", "text": "Jack Palladino\n\nJack Palladino is a San Francisco-based private investigator and attorney. Born in Boston, he attended Boston Latin School and went on to do his undergraduate studies at Cornell. He subsequently moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to pursue graduate studies at UC Berkeley, first as a Ford Fellow in political science and then at Berkeley's Boalt Hall law school.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, he founded the private detective agency Palladino & Sutherland with his wife, Sandra Sutherland. Palladino and Sutherland met in 1972 during the course of an undercover investigation into abuses against the inmates of a New York prison on behalf of the Long Island District Attorney. Over a career spanning more than three decades, he has specialized in the preparation for trial of witnesses and evidence in litigation.\n\nPalladino is best known for his work in the Peoples Temple tragedy, his defense of car maker John DeLorean, and for the Bill Clinton presidential election committee, the tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, singer Courtney Love, and musician R. Kelly. He was also a close friend of San Francisco adult-entertainment pioneers Jim and Artie Mitchell, whose O'Farrell Theatre Palladino frequently visited.\n\nWhile still in law school (at UC Berkeley), he was hired by the family of Patty Hearst to assist in the matter of her 1974 kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA).\n\nPalladino spent seven years investigating the Peoples Temple tragedy, in which more than 900 members of a religious cult died in Guyana in 1978. His interviews with surviving members of the cult and their families are now part of the definitive history of that event.\n\nIn 1982, John DeLorean — a former GM executive who had created a struggling independent sports car company — was charged with engaging in a cocaine trafficking deal to fund his company. Palladino & Sutherland interviewed more than two hundred witnesses in a defense which convinced the jury to acquit DeLorean based on entrapment by government agents.\n\nPalladino is perhaps best known for being hired by the Bill Clinton presidential election committee to challenge a smear campaign intended to deny Clinton the Democratic nomination. Palladino's work included discrediting women with whom Clinton supposedly had been intimate, according to Newsweek magazine. The Clinton election committee reportedly paid Palladino over $100,000 over several years to \"investigate\" two dozen women in a \"damage control inquiry.\"\n\nMichael Isikoff claimed the Clinton campaign used deception regarding the payments. He says the payouts came from campaign funds, but were listed as legal fees paid to a Denver law firm rather than payments to Palladino. He further claimed that Clinton's chief of staff Betsy Wright later told him the funds were for \"controlling Bimbo eruptions.\"\n\nPalladino also was employed by singer Courtney Love to talk to journalists investigating whether she was involved in the 1994 death of her husband, singer Kurt Cobain. Palladino insists he was never involved in \"fear and intimidation\" in his investigations and production of dossiers on such journalists.\n\nWhen former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand began cooperating with \"60 Minutes\" on insider revelations of tobacco company manipulations designed to increase smoker addiction, the industry launched a million dollar public relations campaign to discredit him. Palladino engaged in a counter-investigation that turned the spotlight onto this smear campaign and preserved Wigand's credibility as an expert witness in a lawsuit that subsequently resulted in a more than two hundred billion dollar settlement, in the first successful litigation against Big Tobacco. This effort is chronicled in Marie Brenner's May 1996 \"Vanity Fair\" article \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" and in the 1999 Michael Mann film \"The Insider\" in which Palladino appears as himself, and his partner, Sandra Sutherland, is played by actress Megan Odebash.\n\nIn 2002, singer, songwriter, and record producer R. Kelly was charged with videotaping himself having sex with an underage teenage girl. An investigation by Palladino that lasted six years culminated in Palladino's testimony at trial challenging the principal prosecution witness, and the acquittal of Kelly in less than a day.\n\nIn April 2009, Australian businessman Peter Holmes à Court admitted in the NSW Supreme Court that the Hollywood actor Russell Crowe had hired Palladino & Sutherland to investigate opposition to the planned takeover of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Crowe had first gotten to know Palladino and his Australian wife and partner, Sandra Sutherland, when all three worked on the film \"The Insider\".\n\nRonan Farrow reported in November 2017 that Harvey Weinstein had, through the lawyer David Boies, employed the private intelligence agencies Kroll, Black Cube and private investigator Jack Palladino to spy on and influence Weinstein's alleged victims as well as reporters who were investigating Weinstein, so as to prevent his conduct from becoming public.\n\nNote: Palladino is often confused with Anthony Pellicano, a Los Angeles-based private investigator whose client list is similarly composed of celebrities.\n\n"}

A member of the noble Bülow family he received an excellent education, and entered the Prussian army in 1768, becoming ensign in 1772, and second lieutenant in 1775. He took part in the Potato War of 1778, and subsequently devoted himself to the study of his profession and of the sciences and arts.\n\nThroughout his life Bülow was devoted to music, his great musical ability bringing him to the notice of King Frederick William II of Prussia, and c. 1790 he was conspicuous in the most fashionable circles of Berlin. He did not, however, neglect his military studies, and in 1792 he was made military instructor to the young Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, becoming at the same time full captain. He took part in the campaigns of 1792-94 on the Rhine, and received for signal courage during the siege of Mainz the order Pour le Mérite and promotion to the rank of major.\nAfter this Bülow went to garrison duty at Soldau. In 1802 he married the daughter of Colonel von Auer, and in the following year he became lieutenant-colonel, remaining at Soldau with his corps. The vagaries and misfortunes of his brother Dietrich affected his happiness as well as his fortune. The loss of two of his children was followed in 1806 by the death of his wife, and a further source of disappointment was the exclusion of his regiment from the field army sent against Napoleon in 1806. The disasters of the campaign aroused his energies. He did excellent service under Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq's command in the latter part of the war, was wounded in action, and finally designated for a brigade command in Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's force.\n\nIn 1808 Bülow married the sister of his first wife, a girl of eighteen. He was made a major-general in the same year, and henceforward he devoted himself wholly to the regeneration of Prussia. The intensity of his patriotism threw him into conflict even with Blücher and led to his temporary retirement; in 1811, however, he was again employed.\n\nIn the critical days preceding the War of the Sixth Coalition, Bülow kept his troops in hand without committing himself to any irrevocable step until the decision was made. On 14 March 1813 he was made a lieutenant-general. He fought against Oudinot in defence of Berlin, and in the summer came under the command of Bernadotte, crown prince of Sweden.\n\nAt the head of an army corps Bülow distinguished himself greatly in the Battle of Grossbeeren, a victory which was attributed almost entirely to his leadership. A little later he won the great victory at the Battle of Dennewitz, which for the second time checked Napoleon's advance on Berlin. This inspired the greatest enthusiasm in Prussia, as being won by mainly Prussian forces, and rendered Bülow's popularity almost equal to that of Blücher.\n\nBülow's corps played a conspicuous part in the final overthrow of Napoleon at Leipzig, and he was then entrusted with the task of evicting the French from Holland and Belgium. In an almost uniformly successful campaign he won a signal victory at Hoogstraten although he was fortunate to be supported, often very significantly, by the British General Thomas Graham, second in command to Lord Wellington. In the campaign of 1814 he invaded France from the north-west, joined Blücher, and took part in the brilliant victory of Laon in March. He was made general of infantry and received the title of Count Bülow von Dennewitz. He also took part in the Allied sovereigns' visit to England in June 1814.\n\nIn the short peace of 1814-1815 Bülow was at Königsberg as commander-in-chief in Prussia proper. He was soon called to the field again, and in the Waterloo Campaign commanded the IV Corps of Blücher's army. He was not present at Ligny, but his corps headed the flank attack upon Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, and bore the heaviest part in the fighting of the Prussian troops around Plancenoit. He took part in the invasion of France, but died suddenly on 25 February 1816, a month after his return to the Königsberg command.\n\n"}

It consists of two chambers – the National Council and the Federal Council. In specific cases, both houses convene as the Federal Assembly. The legislature meets in the Austrian Parliament Building in Vienna.\n\nThe National Council is composed of 183 members elected through proportional representation in a general election. The legislative period lasts five years, elections are held earlier if the National Council prematurely moves for its own dissolution. The National Council is the dominant (albeit 'lower') house in the Austrian Parliament, and consequently the terms \"Parliament\" and \"National Council\" are commonly used synonymously.\n\nThe Federal Council is elected indirectly, through the provincial assemblies (\"Landtage\") of the nine States of the Federal Republic, and reflects the distribution of seats in the Austrian Landtage. The states are represented in the Federal Council roughly in accordance to the size of their populations. Seats are redistributed among the states following each general census, and the overall size of the chamber varies slightly as a result. The current Federal Council is composed of 61 delegates. With regard to most issues, the Federal Council only possesses a dilatory right of veto which can be overridden by the National Council. However, the Federal Council enjoys absolute veto powers over bills intended to alter the powers of either the states, or of the Federal Council itself.\n\nThe Federal Assembly (\"Bundesversammlung\") is a body whose function is mostly ceremonial in nature, and consists of the members of both houses of Parliament. The Federal Assembly convenes only rarely, for instance to witness the inauguration of the Federal President. It might be noted, however, that under exceptional circumstances the Austrian constitution endows the Federal Assembly with significant responsibilities. An example of this would be its pivotal role in the hypothetical impeachment of a Federal President.\n\nBoth houses of Parliament, as well as the Federal Assembly, convene in the Parliament building located on Vienna's Ringstraße. From 2017 to 2020 they convene in the Redoute Wing of the Hofburg due to a reconstruction of the Parliament building.\n\n\n"}

Both independent and government-run grant-funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO), require data and safety monitoring protocols for Phase I and II clinical trials conforming to their standards.\n\nSafety monitoring of a clinical trial is conducted by an independent physician with relevant expertise. This is accomplished by review of adverse event, immediately after they occur, with timely follow-up through resolution.\n\nResponsibility for data and safety monitoring depends on the phase of the study and may be conducted by sponsor or Contract research organization (CRO) staff or contractor, and/or by the Principal clinical investigator/project manager conducting the study. Regardless of the method used, monitoring must be performed on a regular basis. Oversight of the monitoring activity is the responsibility of the sponsor.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, the top five deficiency categories for site inspections caught by clinical monitors as reported in the 2001 Report to the Nation are:\n\nTherefore, the primary goal of clinical trial monitoring is to observe each trial site to ensure that the standardized operation procedures for the trial are being followed, reporting and managing any deviations from the investigation plan as they occur. Monitoring plans in the United States typically also require a clear protocol for reporting adverse/undesirable effects caused by the treatment to the institutional review board (IRB), the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), and the institution funding the research. The FDA itself maintains an Adverse Event Reporting System for such occurrences in clinical trials it oversees in the United States.\n\nClinical monitors execute the monitoring plan laid out by the sponsors and investigators of a clinical trial. Monitors may be referred to by many different titles, such as: Clinical Research Associate, \"on-site\" monitor, Clinical Research Monitor, Study Site Monitor and Quality Specialist. The number of clinical monitors depends on the scale and scope of the trial.\n\nAlmost all field monitoring requires regular visits to the site by the clinical research associate throughout the period of the study. On occasion, an extremely simple, low-risk study might be monitored almost exclusively by telephone except for the startup and closeout visits. Since the concept of \"low risk\" is subjective, this definition should be established in internal policies and procedures.\n\nThe level of scrutiny of monitoring varies across studies based on risks and nature of the trial. \n\nConsiderations that affect the design of monitoring plans usually include:\nSeveral of these factors depend on the phase of the clinical trial--for example, in some early Phase I studies of drugs whose effects on different individuals are unknown, the monitor may be required to be present during all or part of a subject's treatment, while Phase II investigations usually involve multiple investigation sites.\n\nThe overall monitoring plan should remain fairly consistent, but the strategy for individual sites may change considerably during the course of the study depending on study conditions and site performance.\n\n\n\n"}

The stadium was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, an American architectural, urban planning, and engineering firm. It was inaugurated on 18 October 1971 by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran; it is currently self-owned by Esteghlal and Persepolis. It is also the home stadium of the Iran national football team. It has a capacity of 78,116 spectators, as the result of conversion to all-seater stadium. The stadium is part of the much larger Azadi Sport Complex, and is surrounded by a rowing river, football training pitches, a weightlifting complex, swimming facilities and indoor volleyball and futsal courts, among many other amenities.\n\n\"Aryamehr\" (meaning \"Light of the Aryans\") was the title of the said Shah; it was renamed after the Iranian Revolution to \"Azadi\" (meaning \"freedom\" in Persian). It is the largest association football stadium in Western Asia. It was built to host the 1974 Asian Games and has hosted the 1976 AFC Asian Cup. The stadium also hosted five finals of Asian Club Competitions: three finals of AFC Champions League in 1999, 2002 and 2018 and two finals of Asian Cup Winners' Cup in 1991 and 1993. Azadi Stadium also hosted WAFF Championship Tournament in 2004 and 2008.\n\nBecause of the loud sound of a vuvuzels, similar to the sound of bees, the stadium is sometimes called a \"Bee swarm\".\n\nThe stadium is located in the West of Tehran, near Ekbatan district, and is easily accessible for most people living in the city. The stadium has two entrances. The West entrance is located on Ferdous street and the East entrance is on Farhangian street.\n\nThe Azadi Stadium was constructed by Arme Construction Company and designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill for the 1974 Asian Games with international criteria. Its land measurement is 450 Hectares and it is located in West Tehran. It replaced the Amjadieh Stadium as the new home of Iran's national football team.\n\nThe stadium was built as part of a much larger complex which included numerous Olympic-sized venues for various sports, laying the groundwork for ambitious plans for Tehran to make a bid to host the Summer Olympics. In August 1975, the Iranian Shah, Tehran's Mayor and the Iranian Olympic Committee submitted a formal letter to the International Olympic Committee, notifying it of Iran's interest in hosting the 1984 Summer Games. The stadium was the focal point for the bid, in which it would have only required slight modifications to become the main Olympic Stadium. But political unrest in the late-1970s saw Tehran drop its bid for Games, leaving the eventual host, Los Angeles, the only city left bidding.\n\nRenovations first began on the stadium in 2002, when the lower level had seats installed and the pitch was replanted along with the installation of an underground heating system. Stadium management also planned to later install seats in the upper level of the stadium. Those renovations were completed in 2003, and brought down the capacity of the stadium to well under 100,000. Later upgrades to the stadium brought it down to its current capacity of 78,116. Despite its reduced capacity, Azadi Stadium has been filled over capacity at times such as the Iran-Japan World Cup 2006 qualification match in March 2005 which resulted in the deaths of seven people. In 2004 a large jumbotron television was added, replacing the original scoreboard. This giant screen with a total area of about 300 square meters and screen area of 104 square meters (20 m by 7.5 m) is one of the biggest in the world. The stadium hosted two West Asian Football Federation Championship in 2004 and 2008. In 2008, AFC forced Sepahan to play the home matches in AFC Champions League in this stadium after their home stadium Naghsh-e-Jahan Stadium was closed for renovation. The stadium also is the regular host for Iran U-23 for the Olympics football qualifying.\n\nIn recent years the Iranian Football Federation has repeatedly submitted bids to host the AFC Asian Cup, which Iran last hosted in 1976. But some officials have hinted that rules in Iran banning women from stadiums like Azadi have kept international sports organizations from staging events there. Iranian women have been banned from watching matches at Azadi Stadium since 1982.\nThe ban on women spectators was lifted for an October 2019 match between the Iranian and Cambodian National Teams.\n\n\nThe architect of the stadium were Abdolaziz Farmanfarmaian and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. At the beginning, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 120,000 visitors but was decreased to 84,000 after renovations in 2003. On the big occasions the crowd swells well beyond that. The design of the stadium amplifies the noise across the pitch. Opposing teams often find it difficult to play their best game, when the stadium is full, as the noise level becomes very high. According to Goal.com, Azadi Stadium was voted most intimidating in Asia. The structural engineer and project manager for the building of the stadium was James Raymond Whittle from England.\n\nThere is enough parking for 400 cars inside the stadium, and an additional 10,000 parking spots are available outside. The nearest metro station is the Varzeshgah-e Azadi Metro Station.\n\nThe record attendance at Azadi Stadium is over 128,000 during a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Australia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221267", "title": "Hybrid airship", "text": "Hybrid airship\n\nA hybrid airship is a powered aircraft that obtains some of its lift as a lighter-than-air (LTA) airship and some from aerodynamic lift as a heavier-than-air aerodyne.\n\nA \"dynastat\" is a hybrid airship with fixed wings and/or a lifting body and is typically intended for long-endurance flights. It requires forward flight to create the aerodynamic lift component.\n\nA \"rotastat\" is a hybrid airship with rotary wings and is typically intended for heavy lift applications. Its rotary wings can provide lift even when hovering or manoeuvring vertically, like a helicopter.\n\nNo production designs have been built, but several manned and unmanned prototypes have flown.\n\nThe term \"hybrid airship\" has also been used to describe an airship comprising a mix of rigid, semi-rigid, and non-rigid construction.\n\nConventional airships have low operating costs because they need no engine power to remain airborne, but are limited in several ways, including low payload/volume ratios and low speeds. Additionally, ground handling of an airship can be difficult. Because it is floating, in even a light breeze it is susceptible to wind buffeting.\n\nOn the other hand, heavier-than-air aircraft, or aerodynes, especially rotorcraft, require the constant use of power to generate lift, and conventional airplanes also require runways.\n\nThe hybrid airship combines the airship's aerostatic lift, from a lighter-than-air gas such as helium, with the heavier-than-air craft's dynamic lift from movement through the air. Such a hybrid craft is still heavier than air, which makes it similar in some ways to a conventional aircraft. The dynamic lift may be provided by helicopter-like rotary wings (the \"rotastat\"), or a lift-producing shape similar to a lifting body combined with horizontal thrust (the \"dynastat\"), or a combination of the two.\n\nHybrid airships are intended to fill the middle ground between the low operating cost and low speeds of traditional airships and the higher speed but higher fuel consumption of heavier-than-air craft. By combining dynamic and buoyant lift, hybrids are intended to provide improved airspeed, air-cargo payload capacity and (in some types) hovering capability compared to a pure airship, while having longer endurance and greater lifting capacity compared to a pure aerodyne.\n\nHybrid aircraft technology is claimed to allow a wider range of flight-performance optimizations ranging from significantly heavier than air to near buoyant. This perception of uncommon dynamic flight range when coupled with an appropriate landing system is claimed to allow ultra heavy and affordable airlift transportation.\n\nCompared to a conventional airship, the hybrid can be made smaller and does not need to carry ballast for altitude control, while compared to a heavier-than-air craft the hybrid requires either a smaller rotor or a shorter runway.\n\nWhere the dynastat is seen as more promising in the longer-distance passenger and freight roles, the rotastat is anticipated to be more suitable as a \"flying crane\" able to lift heavy external loads for shorter distances.\n\nSome airships employ thrust vectoring, typically using pivoted ducted fan propulsors, to provide additional lift when the engine thrust is no longer needed for forward propulsion. Once airspeed is gained, the craft can use body lift to help carry a load greater than its aerostatic lift capacity alone. However, such airships are not usually regarded as hybrids.\n\nThe dynastat obtains additional lift by flying through the air. Configurations studied have included using deltoid (triangular), lenticular (circular), or flattened hulls, or adding a fixed wing.\n\nSome early airships were fitted with wing planes, with the intention of providing additional dynamic lift. However, the added lift of planes can be less efficient than simply increasing the volume of the airship. At low air speeds, of or less, the increase in lift obtained by the use of planes on an airship would require a disproportionate increase in engine power and fuel consumption compared to increasing the size of the gas bags. Moreover, the attachment of flying surfaces to the airship's envelope would require significant structural strengthening, with attendant weight gain.\n\nConventional airships often make use of aerodynamic lift by using their elevators to set a nose-up attitude so that the main body of the airship provides some lift as it flies along; however, this is typically done to counteract minor out-of-trim conditions, and it is as likely that the nose may need to be pointed down to reduce lift.\n\nSome Hybrid designs, such as the Lockheed Martin LMZ1M, use a flattened or multi-lobed hull to increase the aerodynamic lift obtainable. The aerodynamic approach is similar to that of a lifting body aircraft, although the airspeeds involved are much lower. Attainable dynamic-lift-to-drag ratios are significantly below those of efficient fixed wings, in part because induced drag increases with decreasing aspect ratio. As a result, the lift comes at a higher drag penalty than when using wings. On the other hand, compared to a helicopter, the dynastat has better fuel efficiency within a given speed range.\n\nAnother issue arises during take off and landing, when, in calmer conditions, the airspeed may be too low to provide sufficient aerodynamic lift. For this reason, the dynastat is often conceived of as a STOL rather than VTOL aircraft, requiring a shorter runway than a conventional airplane.\n\nThe rotastat obtains additional lift from powered rotors, similarly to a helicopter. Single-, twin-, and four-rotor designs have all been studied.\n\nEarly examples in the inter-war period included designs by Oehmichen and Zodiac. These used the rotors for vertical control only, with additional powered propellers for forward flight, as in the gyrocopter.\n\nIn more recent times, the experimental Piasecki PA-97 \"Helistat\" attached four helicopter airframes to a helium blimp, while the SkyHook JHL-40 remains a project. Typically, aerostatic lift is sufficient to support the weight of the craft itself, while, when a load is carried, the rotors provide additional lift as required.\n\nIf an airship does not have enough lift, it will sink under gravity. By angling the nose down, this can lead to a gliding forward flight just like a conventional glider. If an airship has excess lift, it will rise. By angling the nose up, this can also lead to forward movement. In this way, an airship which periodically alternates its buoyancy between positive and negative, while adjusting its attitude accordingly, can gain almost continuous aerodynamic forward thrust. Thus, flight proceeds in a leisurely vertical zig-zag pattern. Because no energy is consumed directly in creating thrust, the principle allows for flights of long duration, although at slow speeds. The proposed Hunt GravityPlane is a hybrid airship designed to take full advantage of gravity gliding.\n\nThe principle also works underwater, where it is used operationally in the underwater glider.\n\nHistorically, this principle of aerial navigation, under the name of Wellenflug (wavy flight) was first formulated and experimentally tested in the year 1899 by Konstantin Danilewsky in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and described in detail in his book\n\nGliding under gravity dates from the period during and shortly after the American Civil War, when Solomon Andrews built two such airships. The first of these, \"Aereon\", used three individual cigar shaped balloons rigged together in a flat plane; the second, \"Aereon #2\", employed a single \"lemon-shaped\" balloon. Andrews' Aereons were propelled by angling the balloons upward and dropping ballast, then process was then reversed with the balloons being angled downward and large quantities of lifting gas being vented.\n\nIn 1905 Alberto Santos-Dumont conducted various experiments with his first airplane, the Santos-Dumont 14-bis, prior to attempting to fly it for the first time. These included hanging it from a steel cable and towing it, and subsequently hanging it beneath the envelope of a previously built airship (Number 14) - akin to learning to swim with \"water wings\". The combined craft was unusable, and was broken up, being referred to as \"a monstrous hybrid\". After these \"rehearsals\" were completed, Santos-Dumont made the first public demonstration of a heavier-than-air aircraft in Europe.\n\nIn 1907 the British Army Dirigible No 1 (named \"Nulli Secundus\") first flew. It used aerodynamic surfaces for attitude control in flight, and for its first flight was also fitted with large wings amidships. The wings were intended to aid stability rather than provide lift and were removed for all subsequent flights. The use of dynamic lift by pitching the nose of the airship up or down was also recognised and practised on this airship.\n\nIn June 1907 Alberto Santos Dumont constructed his No. 16, described by l'Aérophile as an \"appareil mixte\". This had a envelope but was too heavy to fly without supplementary lift supplied by a wing surface. It was tested without success on 8 June 1907.\n\nThe Aereon 26 was an aircraft which made its first flight in 1971. It was a small-scale prototype of the hybrid Airship Aereon Dynairship and part of the \"TIGER\" project. But it was never built due to lack of market for a hybrid airship.\n\nIn 1984 the AeroLift CycloCrane helistat flew briefly.\n\nThe 1986 Piasecki PA-97 Helistat experimental design combined four helicopters with a blimp in an attempt to create a heavy-lift vehicle for forestry work. It broke up at the end of its first flight.\n\nThe SkyCat or \"Sky Catamaran\" vehicular technology is a hybrid aircraft amalgamation; a scale version at 12 meters called \"SkyKitten\", built by the Advanced Technologies Group Ltd, flew in 2000.\nThe U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated the Walrus Hybrid Ultra Large Aircraft program in 2005, a technology development initiative focused on ultra heavy air lift technology explorations. The program was terminated in 2007.\n\nIn 2006, the Lockheed Martin P-791 underwent manned flight tests. It was an unsuccessful candidate for the military Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle program even though it was the only successful Hybrid Airship to have ever flown until 7 August 2016.\n\nIn 2008, Boeing announced that it was teaming up with SkyHook to develop a heavy duty lifting vehicle, the SkyHook JHL-40 Boeing subsequently shelved the project.\n\nThe Hybrid Air Vehicles HAV 304 was built for the US Army Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) program. It flew successfully for 90 minutes in August 2012. Following cancellation of the LEMV project, Hybrid Air Vehicles re-purchased the HAV 304 vehicle and brought it back to the UK. It has been refurbished and renamed the \"Airlander 10\". On August 17, 2016 the Airlander 10 had its first successful test flight outside the Cardington Hangars at RAF Cardington. Chief Test Pilot Dave Burns said in a statement \"It was privilege to fly the Airlander for the first time and it flew wonderfully. I’m really excited about getting it airborne. It flew like a dream.\" Over 200 more flight hours are needed for full certification.\n\nA Canadian start-up, Solar Ship Inc, is developing solar powered hybrid airships that can run on solar power alone. The idea is to create a viable platform that can travel anywhere in the world delivering cold medical supplies and other necessitates to locations in Africa and Northern Canada without needing any kind of fuel or infrastructure. The hope is that technology developments in solar cells and the large surface area provided by the hybrid airship are enough to make a practical solar powered aircraft. Some key features of the Solarship are that it can fly on aerodynamic lift alone without any lifting gas, and the solar cells along with the large volume of the envelope allow the hybrid airship to be reconfigured into a mobile shelter that can recharge batteries and other equipment.\n\nThe Hunt \"GravityPlane\" (not to be confused with the ground-based gravity plane) is a proposed gravity-powered glider by Hunt Aviation in the USA. It also has aerofoil wings, improving its lift-drag ratio and making it more efficient. The GravityPlane requires a large size in order to obtain a large enough volume-to-weight ratio to support this wing structure, and no example has yet been built. Unlike a powered glider, the GravityPlane does not consume power during the climbing phase of flight. It does however consume power at the points where it changes its buoyancy between positive and negative values. Hunt claim that this can nevertheless improve the energy efficiency of the craft, similar to the improved energy efficiency of underwater gliders over conventional methods of propulsion. Hunt suggest that the low power consumption should allow the craft to harvest sufficient energy to stay aloft indefinitely. The conventional approach to this requirement is the use of solar panels in a solar-powered aircraft. Hunt has proposed two alternative approaches. One is to use a wind turbine and harvest energy from the airflow generated by the gliding motion, the other is a thermal cycle to extract energy from the differences in air temperature at different altitudes.\n\n\n\n"}

During the development phase of \"Carnival!\", Gower Champion and Michael Stewart – respectively set to direct the musical and write its book – would visit Merrill's apartment every morning and leave each afternoon disappointed by the lack of any evident hit song in the proposed score Merrill had played for them. When seeing out Champion and Stewart one afternoon, Merrill became irate at his visitors' attitude, telling them: \"While you're waiting for this f**king elevator I can write the song I know you want\" and improvising a tune reminiscent of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Carousel Waltz\".

Commissioned in 1917, it disappeared in the Pacific Ocean in 1921. The fate of the vessel was a mystery until its wreck was positively identified in 2016.\n\nThe tug was built for the as the \"Conestoga\" in 1904 by Maryland Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland. She was purchased on 14 September 1917 for the World War I duty and designated SP-1128. She was commissioned on 10 November 1917, Lieutenant (junior grade) C. Olsen, USNRF, in command.\n\nAssigned to the Submarine Force, \"Conestoga\" carried out towing duties along the Atlantic coast, transported supplies and guns, escorted convoys to Bermuda and the Azores, and cruised with the American Patrol Detachment in the vicinity of the Azores. At the end of the war she was attached to Naval Base No. 13, Azores, from which she towed disabled ships and escorted convoys until her arrival at New York on 26 September 1919.

After her marriage to Ferdinand was annulled, the former queen became a nun.\n\nUrraca was born in Coimbra in 1148. She was the daughter of Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Maud of Savoy. She had several siblings, including Sancho I. In May or June 1165, Urraca married Ferdinand II of León. The only son of this marriage, Alfonso IX, was born in Zamora on 15 August 1171. The marriage of Ferdinand II and Urraca was annulled in 1171 or 1172 by Pope Alexander III because the two were second cousins, great-grandchildren of Alfonso VI of León and Castile.\n\nAfter the annulment of her marriage, Urraca became a nun joining the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem and retired to live in the estates that her former husband had given her in the Carta de Arras (wedding tokens) in Zamora. Later, she retired in the Monastery of Santa María de Wamba which belonged to the aforementioned order.\n\nOn 25 May 1176, Queen Urraca donated land and villas to the Order of Saint John, probably coinciding with her joining the order. These properties included Castroverde de Campos and Mansilla in León and Salas and San Andrés in Asturias. She was present in 1188 at the coronation of her son Alfonso IX who inherited the throne after his father's death on 22 January 1188 and, in that same year, on 4 May, both confirmed the privileges granted by the former king to the Order of Santiago.

The cars were designed in-house at the prompting of Lee Iacocca.\n\nIt used the same chassis and engine options as the Omni but had unique bodywork and front end styling. The base engine was a 1.7 L Volkswagen inline four producing , with a 2.2 L, Chrysler inline four as an option beginning in 1981. By then, the smaller engine only produced .

{"id": "2221326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221326", "title": "Lorenz von Stein", "text": "Lorenz von Stein\n\nLorenz von Stein (18 November 1815 – 23 September 1890) was a German economist, sociologist, and public administration scholar from Eckernförde. As an advisor to Meiji period Japan, his liberal political views influenced the wording of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan as well as major constitutional thinkers such as Rudolf von Gneist.\n\nAccording to Colin Gordon, Stein articulated a \"vision of a liberal state as active historic partner in the making of civil society\" and called for \"a tabling of the question of class formation as part of the state's agenda.\" Stein advocated a combination of constitutional liberal state with a welfare state, and has been called the \"intellectual father of the welfare state. Stein and other Hegelian liberals, such as Robert von Mohl, also had a profound influence on American progressivism.\n\nStein was born in the seaside town of Borby in Eckernförde in Schleswig-Holstein as Wasmer Jacob Lorentz. He studied philosophy and jurisprudence at the universities of Kiel and Jena from 1835–1839, and at the University of Paris from 1841–1842. Between 1846 and 1851 Stein was an associate professor at the University of Kiel. He participated in the 1848 Revolutions and ran for election as a member of the Frankfurt Parliament. His advocacy of independence for his native Schleswig, then part of Denmark, led to his dismissal in 1852.\n\nIn 1848, Stein published a book entitled \"Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)\" in which he introduced the term \"social movement\" into scholarly discussions—depicting actually in this way political movements fighting for the social rights understood as the welfare rights.\n\nThis theme was repeated in 1850, when Stein published a book titled \"History of the French Social Movements from 1789 to the Present (1850).\" For Stein, the social movement was basically understood as a movement from society to the state, created by the inequalities in the economy, making the proletariat part of politics through representation. The book was translated into the English by Kaethe Mengelberg and published by Bedminster Press in 1964 (Cahman, 1966)\n\nFrom 1855, until his retirement in 1885, von Stein was a professor of Political economy at the University of Vienna. His work from that period is considered as the basis of the international science of public administration. He also influenced the practice of public finance.\n\nIn 1882, Japanese Prime Minister of Japan Itō Hirobumi headed a delegation to Europe to study western governmental systems. The delegation went first to Berlin, where they were instructed by Rudolf von Gneist, and then Vienna, where Stein was lecturing at the University of Vienna. As with Gneist, Stein's message to the Japanese delegation was that universal suffrage and party politics should be avoided. Stein held that the state was above society, and that the purpose of the state was to bring about social reform, which was implemented from the monarchy down to the common people. \n\nHowever, Stein is best known for the fact that he applied Hegel's dialectic to the area of public administration and the national economy, in order to improve the systematics of these sciences, although he did not neglect the historical aspects.\n\nStein analyzed the class state of his time and compared it with the welfare state. He outlined an economic interpretation of history that included concepts of the proletariat and of class struggle, but he shared the fear of violent revolution common among middle-class liberals and advocated reformist solutions instead. He gave emphasis to the \"Social Question\" that the industrial worker in a capitalist has no chance to acquire property and capital by work, which was to be addressed by a program of welfare state and social administration arranged according to the liberal principle of free and equal individual chances. \n\nDespite a similarity of his ideas with those of Marxism, the extent of Stein's influence on Karl Marx is uncertain. However, Marx shows by scattered remarks on von Stein that he was aware of his highly influential book from 1842 on communist thought in France. For instance in \"The German Ideology\" (1845–46), Stein is mentioned, but only as the writer of his 1842 book.\n\nStein died at his home in Hadersdorf-Weidlingau in the Penzing District of Vienna and was buried at the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

This was an ancient area of heathland and latterly the site of Martlesham Heath Airfield. A \"new village\" was established there in the mid-1970s and this has developed into a modern community, based on a traditional village pattern. The population is still included in that of Martlesham.\n\nThere is evidence of settlement in this area since the Bronze Age, with a number of round barrows surviving to the present. The main community of Martlesham grew up to the north-east, initially on the highest ground, where Martlesham Church is still located, then, later, centring on the point where the main London-to-Yarmouth road crosses the River Finn, a tributary to the Deben.\n\nWhite's 1844 directory of Suffolk describes Martlesham as \"a neat village near the confluence of a rivulet with the Deben\" but mentions that the parish includes \"a large, sandy, and unenclosed heath, extending about 2 miles S.W., and affording pasturage for numerous herds of sheep and cattle.\"\n\nUp until 2013, the village held an annual festival, 'Village Day' latterly known as 'Music on the Green'. This event attracted hundreds of people each June with attractions such as live music fairground rides and Llama Jousting.\n\nIn 1917, the Experimental Aircraft Flight of the Central Flying School was transferred from Upavon, Wiltshire to a site on the heathland at Martlesham and, on 16 January 1917, Martlesham Heath Airfield was officially opened, as an experimental airfield. The unit was renamed the \"Aeroplane Experimental Unit, Royal Flying Corps\". After the end of World War I the site continued to be used and was, once again, renamed as the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) of the Royal Air Force.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, the A&AEE was removed to a site at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, owing to the proximity of Martlesham Heath to the East Coast and its vulnerability to enemy attack. The airfield then took on a new role as a base for fighter squadrons defending Britain. Wing Commander (later Group Captain) Douglas Bader, D.S.O., D.F.C. served at Martlesham Heath with 222 and 242 Squadrons, in 1940.\n\nAt the end of hostilities, there was no longer a role for Martlesham Heath as an operational RAF airfield and no prospect of the A&AEE returning, but the site was again used for a number of experiments with planes and armaments. However, its use declined in the 1950s, and the airfield was closed in the early 1960s.\n\nVarious proposals were put forward for the development of the site, including the proposal that it should become a civil airport. Parts of the old airfield were let out to light industry and storage companies. In 1963 the lease of the site was sold by the Air Ministry to Bradford Property Trust Ltd, for a price of £72,500.\n\nIn 1968, the Post Office purchased part of the airfield and surrounding farmland and announced that they would be relocating their Research Department from Dollis Hill to a new centre to be built at Martlesham Heath. The building work took place in the early 1970s and this site has remained as the central research and development facility through the changes that have taken place with the separation of British Telecom from the Post Office and the privatisation of British Telecommunications. In the 1980s, the facility was renamed as BT Labs and was subsequently developed into a high tech business park called Adastral Park in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1972 a proposal was presented by Bradford Property Trust to the Planning Department of the local council to develop a \"New Village\" of Martlesham Heath, with houses for 3000 people, with associated shops, schools and recreational facilities. This was accepted and has resulted in the development of the present community of Martlesham Heath. The vision of this development was to create a completely new community, but based on a traditional pattern. Hence, the village is centred on a village green, with a pub, church and cricket pavilion. In order to maintain a consistent appearance as a village, homeowners at Martlesham Heath are restricted by covenants which govern changes that they can make to their houses and gardens: for example, residents are prevented from attaching external television aerials to their houses. However, many have erected satellite TV dishes, since these were not foreseen when the covenants were written and are therefore allowed. A cable TV system was built into the development (originally provided by BT but later sold to NTL) which was the best option before satellite, since it was provided at cost price and off-air broadcasts had poor reception.\n\nThis area is very prosperous, with most homeowners having a higher income than the national average.\n\nThere is no railway station in Martlesham Heath, but there are several bus services.\n\n"}

It is located just outside Fort McMurray in the Athabasca Oil Sands, and has a nameplate capacity of of oil, equivalent to about 13% of Canada's consumption. It has approximately of proven and probable reserves (11.9 billion when including contingent and prospective resources) situated on 8 leases over 3 contiguous sites. Including fully realized prospective reserves, current production capacity could be sustained for well over 90 years.\n\nThe company is a joint venture between five partners. As a result, Syncrude is not traded directly, but rather through the individual owners. As of February 2018, the partners (by percentage): Suncor Energy (58.74%), Imperial Oil (25%), Sinopec (9.03%), Nexen (7.23%) Because of Nexen's subsequent takeover by CNOOC, over 16% of the shares in Syncrude are controlled by Chinese State Owned Enterprises (SOE).\n\nThe ownership board must approve all annual operating budgets and proposed capital spending projects, and are required to provide the funding for said activities based on their ownership share.\n\nSyncrude was formed as a research consortium in 1964 by Ryan Sheppard. Construction at the Syncrude site began in 1973, and it officially opened in 1978. Starting in 1996, Syncrude has been expanding its operations. Between 1996 and 1999, the original mine was expanded and the plant was \"debottlenecked\", increasing production from per year in 1996 to 81.4 million in 1999. The total cost of this stage of expansion was $470 million.\nBetween 1998 and 2001, a new mine, Aurora, was opened 35 km north of the original site, and further debottlenecking was undertaken. Production started in Aurora in July 2001. Syncrude's production increased to per year by the end of 2001. Total cost for this stage was $1 billion.\n\nA third stage of expansion was undertaken between 2001 and 2006, in which a second train at the Aurora line came online and the Mildred Lake upgrader was expanded. The expansion added to Syncrude's production ( a year assuming this is average). The cost was $8.4 billion, a substantial cost overrun over the original estimate of $5.7 billion.\n\nOn April 12, 2010, ConocoPhillips agreed to sell its share to Sinopec, a Chinese state-owned oil company. The sale, for $4.65 billion, was completed on June 25, 2010.\n\nA 183 m (600 ft) smokestack is located at the facility which is the second tallest in western Canada.\n\nIn April 2016, Suncor announced that they had reached a $937-million deal to acquire Murphy Oil Corp.'s five per cent stake in the Syncrude project north of Fort McMurray, Alta. This follows the hostile takeover of Canadian Oil Sands less than a year ago, and will increase its interest in Syncrude from just under 49 per cent to nearly 54 per cent, making it the majority shareholder of the project.\n\nThe 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire forced a complete shutdown of Syncrude's facilities.\n\nAir releases of combined gases without volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by Syncrude Canada in 2005 were 129,741,321 (kg) in total, including ammonia (4,302,361 kg), sulphuric acid (1,129,425 kg), xylene (501,461 kg), etc. The company was also ranked as having the seventh highest air releases of combined gases (without VOC) in Canada in 2005. Syncrude's Mildred Lake Plant Site is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in Canada emitting 12,359,420 tonnes of CO equivalent in 2012.\nResearch published in 2019 indicated that the intensity of CO emissions at the Syncrude Mildred Lake site may be 123% larger than calculations from publicly reported data would indicate.\n\nSyncrude is a member of Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), an alliance of oil sands producers formed in 2012, who share research on Environmental Priority Areas (EPAs) such as tailing pond water and greenhouse gases. One of the major challenges facing COSIA is the treatment of oil sands tailings pond water. \"Tailings are the sand, silt, clay and water found naturally in oil sands that remain following the mining and bitumen extraction process.\" The problem stems from the hot water process used by Suncor and Syncrude to extract bitumen from the Athabasca Oil Sands which produce large quantities of tailings pond sludge which remains stable for decades. By 1990 it was considered to be the \"imminent environmental constraint to future use of the hot water process.\"\nSyncrude also contributes to the industry-funded Joint Oil sands Monitoring Program which was created in 2012 and managed by the federal and Alberta governments.\nAccording to a 2013 article published in \"Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts\", the tailings ponds contain toxic chemicals such as \"naphthenic acids (NAs) and process chemicals (e.g., alkyl sulphates, quaternary ammonium compounds, and alkylphenol ethoxylates).\" The study used the computer program (CXTFIT) to evaluate the transport behaviour of these contaminants through the foundation as well as underground. The chemicals seep \"through the foundation of the tailings pond to the subsurface, potentially affecting the quality of groundwater.\"\n\nIn an article accepted for publication in \"Environmental Science and Technology\" journal in January 2014, Environment Canada's Richard Frank and his team of scientists confirmed that, using new technology, they were able to \"fingerprint the mix of groundwater chemicals in the area\" proving that oil sands tailings pond water had leached into groundwater and the Athabasca River. The study undertaken by a new federal-provincial oil sands monitoring program used new $1.6-million technology acquired in 2010. The equipment is able to \"fingerprint chemicals and trace them back to where they came from.\"\n\nIn August 2008, Syncrude Canada filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace Canada for $120,000, plus costs, after 11 Greenpeace activists went on to the company's Aurora North oil sands site July 24, 2008, to unfurl anti-oil sands banners and unsuccessfully block a tailings pipe. Company spokesperson Mark Kruger said the company filed the lawsuit—which also names the activists individually—largely because of safety concerns as the activists were \"unfamiliar with an industrial operation, and unfamiliar with some of the safety hazards that can be present... We just want to ensure that, in the future, nobody is putting themselves at unnecessary risk.\"\n\nGreenpeace chose the Syncrude site for the protest because in April 2008, 1600 migrating ducks died after landing on a tailings pond at the site (Syncrude was fined $3 million.)\n\nIn 2004, Syncrude announced an $800,000 multi-year donation, $500,000 of which was dedicated to the new community Syncrude Sport and Wellness Centre and the balance to Keyano Theatre’s Arts Alive Series and student scholarships. In 2005, Syncrude invested another $200,000 and took the naming rights to the Syncrude Sports and Wellness Centre at Keyano College.\n\n\n"}

He signed his first MLB contract with the team on May 21, 1993. He made his MLB debut in 1999, appearing in 6 games. In 2000, he began the season in Triple-A, and then decided (with club permission) to not play at the MLB in September in order to participate in the Olympics. During those Olympics in Sydney, he and his teammates won a gold medal, defeating Cuba 4-0 in the title game. After missing the 2000 season in the big leagues, Franklin posted a strong spring training and won a job in the Mariners bullpen, appearing in 38 games. The next season, Franklin began the season in the bullpen but after the first half of the season, was moved to the rotation. He finished with a record of 7-5 in 41 appearances, 12 starts. In 2003, Franklin began in the rotation and was one of the Mariners most consistent starters, posting an ERA of 3.57 in 212 innings. He tied for the Major League lead in home runs allowed in 2003, with 34.\n\nIn 2004, Franklin and the whole Seattle team struggled, losing 99 games. Franklin for his part went 4-16 with a 4.90 ERA in 200 innings. He struck out a career high 104. In 2005, he went 8-15 with a career high 5.10 in 190 innings. He struck out 93. After the 2005 season, Franklin filed for free agency.\n\nOn January 13, Franklin signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. Franklin shifted back to a bullpen role, appearing in 46 games.\n\nOn August 7, 2006, Franklin was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for a player to be named later, who turned out to be minor league pitcher Zac Stott. Franklin pitched the rest of the season out of the bullpen, appearing in 20 games.\n\nOn January 22, , Franklin signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on a one-year, $1 million contract. He signed a two-year, $5 million contract extension with a $2.75 million club option for 2010 on July 5, 2007. He was promoted to closer on May 17, . Franklin was named to the 2009 All-Star Game roster. On September 1, , Franklin signed a two-year, $6.5 million contract extension with the Cardinals. In 2009, he finished the regular season with a 1.92 ERA, and 38 saves.\n\nOn April 19, 2011, Franklin (who blew 2 saves in 29 chances in the 2010 season) was removed from his closer role after (among other struggles on the mound) blowing four saves in five chances to start the 2011 season. Despite the poor season he is still considered a World Series Champion in 2011 with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHe was released on June 29, after recording an 8.46 ERA, giving up 44 hits (.367 batting average against), nine home runs, walking seven and striking out 17 in 27 2/3 innings for a 1.84 WHIP in 21 games with the Cardinals in 2011. He retired on December 9, 2011.\n\nFranklin was a member of the gold medal winning Team USA at the 2000 Olympics, where he had a 3-0 pitching record in 4 appearances.\n\nHe is married to Angie Romberg and the couple has four children: Logan, Teegan, Casen, and Kaylin. He and his family live in Shawnee, Oklahoma. His nephew, Kohl, is also a baseball player.\n\nOn August 2, , Franklin became the eighth MLB player, and second Mariner, to test positive for steroid use, receiving a ten-day suspension. On December 13, , he was named in the Mitchell Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221355", "title": "Staphylococcus hominis", "text": "Staphylococcus hominis\n\nStaphylococcus hominis is a coagulase-negative member of the bacterial genus \"Staphylococcus\", consisting of Gram-positive, spherical cells in clusters. It occurs very commonly as a harmless commensal on human and animal skin and is known for producing thioalcohol compounds that contribute to body odour. Like many other coagulase-negative staphylococci, \"S. hominis\" may occasionally cause infection in patients whose immune systems are compromised, for example by chemotherapy or predisposing illness.\n\nColonies of \"S. hominis\" are small, usually 1–2 mm in diameter after 24 hours' incubation at 35 °C, and white or tan in colour. Occasionally, strains are resistant to novobiocin and may be confused with other resistant species (e.g. \"S. saprophyticus\").\n\nIt is one of only two species of \"Staphylococcus\" to display sensitivity to desferrioxamine, the other being \"S. epidermidis\". Unlike \"S. epidermidis\", \"S. hominis\" produces acid from trehalose, so the two tests together serve to identify the species.\n\nNumerous coagulase-negative staphylococci appear commonly on the skin of human. Of these species, \"S. epidermidis\" and \"S. hominis\" are the most abundant. While \"S. epidermidis\" tends to colonize the upper part of the body, \"S. hominis\" tends to colonize in areas with numerous apocrine glands, such as axillae and the pubic region. In a certain study, \"S. hominis\" was calculated to account for 22% of the total staphylococcal species recovered from individuals, second to \"S. epidermidis\" at 46%. \"S. hominis\" is the predominant species on the head, axillae, arms, and legs.\n\"S. hominis\", as well as most other staphylococcal species common on the human skin, is able to produce acid aerobically from glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, and glycerol. Some strains were also able to produce acid from turanose, lactose, galactose, melezitose, mannitol, and mannose. Most strains colonize on the skin for relatively short periods of time compared to other \"Staphylococcus\" species. They, on average, stay on the skin for only several weeks or months.\nThe cell wall contains low amounts of teichoic acid and glutamic acid. The cell wall teichoic acid contains glycerol and glucosamine.\n\"S. hominis\" cells are Gram-positive cocci, usually 1.2 to 1.4 μm in diameter. They appear normally in tetrads and sometimes in pairs.\n\nBased on a total of 240 strains, all were resistant to lysozyme, some were slightly resistant to lysostaphin, 77% were susceptible to penicillin G, 97% to streptomycin, 93% to erythromycin, 64% to tetracycline, and 99% to novobiocin.\n\nMulti drug resistant strains of s. hominis have been isolated from blood and wound cultures in humans.\n\nWhen grown in agar cultures, colonies are usually circular, 4.0 to 4.5 mm in diameter. Agar colonies usually have wide edges and an elevated center. They are commonly smooth with dull surfaces, and are yellow-orange pigmented in the center of the opaque colonies. They grow both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but tend to grow significantly less in the latter. Optimal NaCl concentrations of the agar culture for the growth of \"S. hominis\" seem to be around 7.5%, and a salt concentration of 15% yielded poor growth to no growth at all. The optimal growth temperature range was around 28 to 40 °C, but good growth is still observed at 45 °C, while no growth is observed at 15 °C. \n\"S. hominis\" can be differentiated from staphylococci by its colony morphology and pigmentation patterns, predominant tetrad cell arrangement, poor growth in thioglycolate, low tolerance of NaCl, and carbohydrate reaction pattern. Each species is also significantly different in cell wall composition, lactic acid configuration, temperature extremes of growth, coagulase activity, hemolysis acetylmethylcarbinol production, nitrate reduction, and phosphatase, DNase, and bacteriolytic activities. Similarities in these properties between \"S. hominis\" and several other species suggest a close relationship between \"S. hominis\" and \"S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus\", and \"S. warneri\".\n\n\"S. hominis\" is normally found on human skin and is usually harmless, but can sometimes cause infections in people with abnormally weak immune systems. Most, if not all, strains are susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, and novobiocin, but a divergent strain, \"S. hominis\" subsp. \"novobiosepticus\" (SHN), was isolated between 1989 and 1996. This strain was named so because of its unique resistance to novobiocin and its failure to produce acid aerobically from trehalose and glucosamine. In addition, the 26 isolated strains of this new subspecies are resistant to nalidixic acid, penicillin G, oxacillin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. They were also somewhat resistant to methicillin and gentamicin, and most strains were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin, as well. In addition, \"S. hominis hominis\" is commonly found isolated from human skin, but as of 1998, no SHN isolate from human skin had been reported.\n\nThe SHN is so similar to the original \"S. hominis\", now called \"S. hominis\" subsp. \"hominis\", that in 2010, a \"MicroScan\" system that clinical microbiology laboratories used, identified 7 of 31 \"S. hominis novobiosepticus\" cultures as \"S. hominis hominis\". The relationship between the two was unknown, but antibiotic-resistant isolates of \"S. hominis\" belonged only to SHN.\nSHN strains seems to have thickened cell walls, which can be the result of a genetic background that also allows for vancomycin resistance. The thickened cell walls exist in subspecies with and without vancomycin resistance which suggests this subspecies did not originate from the acquiring of resistance genes.\n\nThe combined resistance to novobiocin and oxacillin is hypothesized to have originated from a simultaneous introduction of genes controlling the resistance to the two. These genes were believed to have been acquired originally through heterologous DNA from a methicillin-resistant strain of one of the novobiocin-resistant species belonging to the \"S. sciuri\" or the \"S. saprophyticus\" groups. The larger genome size of the SHN compared to that of \"S. hominis hominis\" may be the result of the acquiring of heterologous DNA. This new, divergent strain was first described in 1998, and was first implicated in causing bacteremia in 2002. \nAnother hypothesis is the insertion of the \"mec A\" gene and its flanking sequence into the chromosome of SHN might have affected the expression of a closely linked gene, which converted the host to become novobiocin-resistant.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, 32 isolates of SHN were found in 21 patients. Twenty-three of these were from blood cultures, six from catheters, one from cerebrospinal fluid, one from a wound, and one from external ear fluid. Eighteen of the 21 patients from whom these isolates were recovered were neonates, one was a 13-year-old boy, and two were adults.\nThirteen of these cases were confirmed as sepsis in neonates resulting from SHN infection. These were the first clinical reports of SHN causing bacterimia in hospitalized patients. SHN infections were high in morbidity, but had a low rate of mortality. More undocumented instances of SHN infections may not have been reported because not all coagulase-negative staphlococcal infections (CONs) are identified to the species level.\nMolecular epidemiology was successful in tracing 13 cases of sepsis in neonates to a single clone of SHN during a two-year study period in neonatal ICUs. Formal investigation regarding the mode of transmission this microbe uses were not conducted, but infants are believed to serve as reservoirs for the microorganism, and transmission takes place with contact between health workers and the infants. In addition, staphylococcal isolates from the nasopharynges and hands of health care workers were shown to be genetically similar to those that colonize or cause disease in neonates. This supports the idea that health workers serve as a form of nosocomical transmission of CONs.\nIf SHN indeed takes residence on human skin, it probably exists in small numbers and would require enrichment for detection. \nSHN has also been responsible for nosocomial outbreaks elsewhere. SHN strains have been causing bloodstream infections, but have still been classified as vancomycin-susceptible.\n\nIn May 2015, two babies from Simojovel rural communities of Chiapas, Mexico, were killed and about 30 required medical attention after receiving vaccines for Hepatitis B, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) launched an investigation to identify the cause of suchs events, the preliminary results showed that the cause was external contamination with Staphylococcus hominis.\n\n"}
{"id": "2221360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221360", "title": "It Takes a Family", "text": "It Takes a Family\n\nIt Takes a Family is a 2005 book by then Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. The title is a response to the 1996 book \"It Takes a Village\" by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. In the book, Santorum states that the family structure is necessary. He argues that liberal social policies have devastated the family structure and that prevailing socially liberal attitudes have systematically devalued families across the board. He argues that government should take a proactive role in promoting strong families.\n\nSantorum criticizes alike \"laissez-faire\" conservatives and liberal proponents of social welfare for promoting a radical view of autonomy. In particular, he criticizes the \"bigs\" -- \"big government, big media, big entertainment, big universities.\" He also says that radical feminists are responsible for undermining the traditional family.\n\nHe explained his views in an interview with National Public Radio:\n\nThey have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever they want to do. Government should keep our taxes down and keep our regulation low and that we shouldn't get involved in the bedroom, we shouldn't get involved in cultural issues, you know, people should do whatever they want. Well, that is not how traditional conservatives view the world, and I think most conservatives understand that individuals can't go it alone, that there is no such society that I'm aware of where we've had radical individualism and that it succeeds as a culture.\n\nMany sympathetic reviews came from politically and religiously conservative organizations and leaders, who welcomed the book as refreshing and bold. The book was praised by conservative Christian media leaders James Dobson and Pat Robertson and promoted through their organizations, as well as by the conservative magazine \"National Review\", which printed a series of excerpts from the book. The magazine's book service called the book's ideas \"innovative\" and \"based on sound values — including the centrality of the family to all social and political life.\" A review by Keith Fournier in \"Catholic Online\" likewise praises the book, saying, \"The author's discussion of how to create a family friendly public policy which promotes fidelity and encourages motherhood, fatherhood and intact families is well thought out and practical.\"\n\nMany reviews were critical of Santorum's work. Claiming that Santorum's social vision was anything but innovative or refreshing, one reviewer for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" referred to Santorum as \"one of the finest minds of the Thirteenth Century\". Writing for \"American Prospect Online\", reviewer Mark Schmitt argues that the book fails to present a unified case for how social conservatism is served by \"laissez-faire\" economic policies, yet urges readers to commit to both; he also asserts that the author offers several solutions already proposed by his opposition, while criticizing the opposition's failure to provide solutions.\n\nRuth Conniff, reviewing the book for \"The Progressive\", comments that certain arguments and examples in the book are seemingly at odds. As an example, the reviewer points out that a success story cited by Santorum as an example of a single mother getting off welfare actually showcases a number of strategies the senator opposes — leaving the children's father, use of public shelters, and use of welfare to support the family while getting an education, rather than leaving school to take a job.\n\nPassages from \"It Takes a Family\" generated controversy during Santorum's 2006 reelection campaign, as well as during his 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2005, when Santorum was on Capitol Hill, then-Senator Hillary Clinton teased him, \"Remember, Rick, it takes a village!\" Santorum took it in stride, telling \"Christian Science Monitor,\" \"She was joking - but in every joke there's something,\" he says. \"So was it a little dig? Yeah, it was both. But it was nicer. ... I took it in good spirit.\"\n\n"}

The dribble also ends when the dribbler palms/carries the ball by allowing it to come to rest in one or both hands. This is a palming/carrying the ball violation if the player continues with another dribble.\n\nThere is an exception to the rule, however, and that is the power dribble. It can only be used once and can only be used after receiving a pass in the lane. The player (usually a center and/or power forward) slams the ball quickly with both hands and retrieves it.

It houses the snake farm, a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe origins of the institute can be traced back to 1912 when King Rama VI granted permission for a government institute to manufacture and distribute rabies vaccine at the suggestion of Prince Damrong, whose daughter, , died from rabies infection. It was officially opened on 26 October 1913 in the Luang Building on Bamrung Muang Road as the \"Pastura Institute\" after Louis Pasteur, who discovered the first vaccine against rabies. In 1917 it was renamed the \"Pasteur Institute\" and placed under the supervision of the Thai Red Cross Society. The institute also produced vaccine against smallpox. The Travel and Immunization Clinic is now located here. If offers vaccines and pre-travel consultation.\n\nIn the early-1920s the king offered his private property for the construction of a new home for the institute on Rama IV Road. The new buildings were officially opened on 7 December 1922, now named for the king's mother, Queen Saovabha Phongsri. At the same time, the institute's first director, Dr. Leopold Robert, requested contributions from foreigners living in Thailand for the establishment of a snake farm, which would enable the institute to manufacture antivenom for snake bites. Reportedly the second snake farm in the world after the one in São Paulo, Brazil, it was opened on 22 November 1923 by Queen Savang Vadhana, then President of the Thai Red Cross, on the institute's premises.\n\nResearch into snake venom is highly important, since many people fall victim to venomous snake bites.

It was founded in January 1996 primarily as a way to advance the interests of a wide variety of indigenous peoples' organizations throughout Ecuador. In the context of Ecuador's indigenous movement, Pachakutik emerged after successful civil society mobilizations by large indigenous organizations such as CONAIE and CONFENAIE. Despite being backed by CONAIE and the workers' Social Movement Cooperation, the party is not affiliated with the organizations, as its official purpose was to serve as an alternative to the traditional cluster of political parties that had ruled Ecuadorian politics. The party has been a topic of controversy among indigenous peoples throughout Ecuador because of its nature as a political party, and many indigenous people are unwilling to recognize it as representing their interests because they feel that the party has compromised too many indigenous demands in order to participate in the political process.\n\nPachakutik participated in the presidential elections of 1996 despite having only been formed a few months beforehand. In order to give a strong media boost to the party in their first presidential election, they recruited a former TV personality named Freddy Ehlers to represent the party on the highest national stage. Although Ehlers failed to win the election, he placed third with nearly twenty percent of the popular vote despite having less than five months to prepare his campaign. In addition, eight members of Pachakutik won seats as national deputies, including CONAIE president Luis Macas, and although they constituted less than ten percent of the seats in the National Congress of Ecuador, the presence of the party was undeniable. For the first time indigenous citizens of Ecuador were present in Congress, representing the interests of all groups throughout the country.\n\nPachakutik, along with a strong civil society effort by CONAIE and others, was instrumental in pushing for the new Ecuadorian Constitution in 1998 which, among other things, recognized the country as multi-cultural, paving the way for such reforms as bilingual education. Since the 1998 elections in which Pachakutik's amount of representation declined, the party has never quite reached its prior levels of support and has been unable to topple the majority of the Congress that does not share their views. It has been criticized by CONAIE for its ineffectiveness, leading to a \"coup d'état\" in 2000 organized by CONAIE in association with sympathetic members of the military. Although after only hours of taking the capital and instituting a three-man junta including CONAIE president Antonio Vargas the government dissipated, echoing CONAIE's frustration. Pachakutik has since distanced itself somewhat from CONAIE while still remaining intensely involved with gaining indigenous rights.\n\nAt the 2002 legislative elections, the party won at least 11 out of 100 seats. Its candidate Lucio Gutiérrez, member of the Patriotic Society Party 21 January won 20.3% of the vote in the presidential elections of the same day and won the second round with 58.7%.\n\nAfter three months of government Gutierrez broke up its alliance with Pachakutik and he discharged its ministers. The party soon grew to despise him and publicly criticize him. In 2003 they even began to call for the removal of President Gutiérrez publicly in the media. The political party is struggling with problems of identity at this point in time and is in risk of losing all that it had originally gained in 1996.\n\nHowever, with Gutierrez out, the return of Luis Macas to the presidency of CONAIE and the opposition to the signature of an agreement of free trade with United States, they have been able to reunify to the movement.\n\nAt the 2006 elections, the party won at least 6 out of 100 seats. Its candidate Luis Macas, obtained 2.19% of the vote in the presidential elections of the same day.\n\nAt the 2009 elections, the party had its worst results since its founding, but still maintains representation, with 4 seats out of 124 in National Assembly.\n\nAt the 2013 elections, the party won at least 5 out of 137 seats. Its candidate Alberto Acosta, obtained 3.26% of the vote in the presidential elections of the same day.\n\nDuring the 2010 Ecuador coup d'état attempt, Pachakutik stated that President Rafael Correa was authoritarian and issued a press release opposing him and supporting police and army rebels. American-Venezuelan lawyer Eva Golinger accused Pachakutik of having accepted funding from USAID and NED, and playing a role as part of a United States plan to destabilise Latin American democracies in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA). Pachakutik denied \"having any relationship at all with the organism known as USAID, previously NED, not today nor ever\". Golinger responded by referring to a National Democratic Institute (NDI, one of the four institutes funded by NED) report from 2007 describing Pachakutik being trained by the NDI in \"Triangle of Party Best Practices and strategic planning methodologies\" as part of NDI's Latin American/Caribbean Political Party Network of over 1400 individual members, funded under NED Core Grants 2000-031, 2001-048, 2003-028, and 2004-036.\n\n\n"}

He goes back to his bed and covers himself with the pillow, however the sound waves from the instrument shake Jerry's mousehole, causing Jerry to fall out of bed (while still trying to cover his ears) and vibrate his way under a table, meanwhile a flower pot is vibrated across the table directly above Jerry's head and falls on him when both reach the edge of the table. Outside, Tom uses the instrument as a bow to shoot himself to Spike, who is still being tyed, tortures the dog by plucking its mouth, and runs back to the string instrument. The camera goes back inside Jerry's mousehole, whose stuff is messed up and broken by the vibration. Jerry continues being moved to under the mail hole's lid right before a match holding it falls, making the lid slam Jerry. Having had enough, Jerry throws off his nightcap, goes out of the mousehole to the kitchen and decides to get revenge by stuffing an iron into a pie which he then hurls at Tom through an open window; the cat is angered, but continues with a few more bars. Seconds later, he is hit in the face again – this time with a pie covered in whipped cream. Spotting Jerry, Tom chases him through the house.\n\nBoth animals dive off an ironing board; with Jerry ahead of Tom, Jerry drains the kitchen sink he landed in, leaving Tom to crash into the crockery. Tom follows Jerry through the open window, but Jerry pulls the window stop out of the window, which falls on Tom's neck, and Tom shrieks in pain. Jerry then runs out and unties Spike, who lets out a loud bull roar. Spike swaps his regular teeth for larger ones, blows off some pent-up steam, and goes after Tom.\n\nTom ducks as Spike's teeth come at him, which instead get lodged in a tree trunk. Tom then barely avoids getting his tail bitten and hides behind a wall, holding a brick up ready to attack. Spike sees the brick and investigates, but gets knocked on the head with it. Jerry revives Spike by hitting him with a wooden plank on his rear end. After slamming Spike, Spike leaps high in the air screaming in pain just as Jerry hands off the board to Tom, framing the cat.\n\nKnowing he is in trouble, Tom tricks Spike into believing the board is a stick by playing \"fetch\". Spike obliges and fetches but then realizes he's been tricked. Tom and Spike then begin a back and forth chase with Toodles Galore watching on. Tom stops periodically to kiss the cat. Catching on to this habit, Spike substitutes himself on the third pass, and gets wooed in a Charles Boyer voice (through archive lines from \"The Zoot Cat\"), but stops his speech abruptly when he sees the female cat. Realizing his mistake, he throws Spike onto the ground. Tom hides from Spike's rampage until Jerry walks around the corner; he chases Jerry into Spike's house, closing the door with a murderous laugh and Dracula leer. A second later, the door opens and Jerry emerges with Spike helping him out of the doghouse, Spike laughing even more evilly as he withdraws inside. The entire dog house thrashes about as Spike beats up Tom, who attempts to flee only to be snatched by Spike. Tom manages to write his last will before he's wrenched back in and beaten to within an inch of his life. In the end, Tom becomes part of his instrument in place of the strings with Spike strumming the cat's tail while Jerry bows a dramatic ostinato on Tom's whiskers and Toodles watches.\n\n\n\nThe short was included on several DVDs: \"Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases\", Vol. 1; \"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection\" Vol. 1, Disc One; and \"Tom and Jerry Golden Collection\" Volume One, Disc Two.\n\nAnimation historian Michael Barrier wrote that Tom's appearance stabilized by the time of \"Solid Serenade\", giving him a more streamlined and less inconsistent look. Jerry, whose appearance was already economical, only became cuter, according to Barrier. Describing music director Scott Bradley's work, academic Daniel Ira Goldmark called \"Solid Serenade\" \"an excellent overview of Bradley's techniques\", as it uses both popular songs and an original score.\n\n"}

{"id": "2221400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221400", "title": "America Is in the Heart", "text": "America Is in the Heart\n\nAmerica Is in the Heart, sometimes subtitled A Personal History, is a 1946 semi-autobiographical novel written by Filipino American immigrant poet, fiction writer, short story teller, and activist, Carlos Bulosan. The novel was one of the earliest published books that presented the experiences of the immigrant and working class based on an Asian American point of view and has been regarded as \"[t]he premier text of the Filipino-American experience.\" In his introduction, journalist Carey McWilliams, who wrote a 1939 study about migrant farm labor in California (\"Factories in the Field\"), described \"America Is in the Heart\" as a “social classic” that reflected on the experiences of Filipino immigrants in America who were searching for the “promises of a better life”.\n\nBorn in 1913, Bulosan recounts his boyhood in the Philippines. The early chapters describe his life as a Filipino farmer \"plowing with a carabao\". Bulosan was the fourth oldest son of the family. As a young Filipino, he once lived on the farm tended by his father, while his mother was separately living in a barrio in Binalonan, Pangasinan, together with Bulosan's brother and sister. Their hardships included pawning their land and having to sell items in order to finish the schooling of his brother Macario. He had another brother named Leon, a soldier who came back after fighting in Europe.\n\nBulosan's narration about his life in the Philippines was followed by his journey to the United States. He recounted how he immigrated to America in 1930. He retells the struggles, prejudice, and injustice he and other Filipinos had endured in the United States, first while in the Northwestern fisheries then later in California. These included his experiences as a migrant and laborer in the rural West.\n\nBulosan's \"America Is in the Heart\" is one of the few books that detail the migrant workers' struggles in the United States during the 1930s through the 1940s, a time when signs like \"Dogs and Filipinos not allowed\" were common. The struggles included \"beatings, threats, and ill health\". In this book, Bulosan also narrated his attempts to establish a labor union. Bulosan's book had been compared to \"The Grapes of Wrath\" except that the main and real characters were brown-skinned. Despite the bitterness however, Bulosan reveals in the final pages of the book that because he loved America no one could ever destroy his faith in his new country. In this personal literature, Bulosan argued that despite the suffering and abuses he experienced, America was an unfinished \"ideal in which everyone must invest (...) time and energy, (...) this outlook leaves us with a feeling of hope for the future instead of bitter defeat.\" According to Carlos P. Romulo when he was interviewed by The New York Times, Bulosan wrote \"America Is in the Heart\" with \"bitterness\" in his heart and blood yet with the purpose of contributing \"something toward the final fulfillment of America\".\n\nThrough \"America Is in the Heart\", Bulosan was able to share a unique perspective on Asian life in the United States in general, but particularly that of Filipino-Americans during the first half of the 20th century. It is a book that encourages people of all races and genders to ponder and improve their relationships with one another.\n\nAfter the 1946 printing, \"America Is in the Heart\" was republished by the University of Washington Press in 1973. Because of its subtitle \"A Personal History\", \"America Is in the Heart\" is regarded as an autobiography but  – according to P.C. Morantte (Bulosan's friend)  – had to be \"fictionalized\" by Bulosan, imbibing the book with real characters. Thus it was described by one character in the book's original draft as \"30% autobiography, 40% case history of Pinoy (Filipino immigrant) life in America, and 30% fiction\".\n\nAs can be evidenced by Carlos Bulosan’s \"America Is in the Heart\", the life of a Filipino migrant worker during the Great Depression was anything but easy. In reality, the life of any Filipino in the United States during this time period was “lonely” and “damned,” as Bulosan described in a letter to a friend. When he and his friend José arrived in California in 1930, “the lives of Filipinos were cheaper than those of dogs.” As the Filipino population grew and the Great Depression worsened, the anti-Filipino movement flourished. This attitude towards Bulosan and his people was led by the same forces that previously condemned the Chinese and the Japanese, and in 1928, the American Federation of Labor encouraged an “exclusion” of the race, which was warmly received in Congress. Despite the fact that most of these immigrants were modernized and able to speak more than one European language, there was a persistent tendency to portray them not only as primitive savages but also sexual threats against white women.\n\nThe anti-Filipino sentiment that plagued the American mindset during this time period can be observed in a few separate events. The most violent and well known incident occurred in California in 1930: four hundred white vigilantes attacked a Filipino night club, injuring dozens and killing one. In 1933, California and twelve other state legislatures restricted Filipino-white marriages. Lastly, in 1935 the Welch Bill volunteered a fixed sum of cash to pay for the fare of Filipinos who would voluntarily go back to the Philippines. Events such as these prove the anti-Filipino sentiment that afflicted Carlos Bulosan and the rest of the Filipino population.\n\nWithout the tribulations of a migrant life during the Great Depression, Bulosan would not have been compelled to write down his thoughts, nor would he have aligned so heavily with the Communist party. The Great Depression in western America was the cause of strong bonds between culture groups and families and further fueled the racial tensions between the white farm owners and the migrant workers. As documented in Bulosan's novel, “fraternity is not limited to biological brothers; the network of young migrant men from the same region serves not only as a microcosm of the Filipino community, but as a gallery of alternative lives and fates…” Because of this connection, when Carlos’ brothers and fellow Filipino workers began to join the Communist party, the only logical response was to follow suit.\n\nBulosan's novel compares to other works written by authors who lived through the Great Depression in that the combination of a strong racial identity and the exposure to the harsh working environments caused the protagonist to desire something more from life. Bulosan “came to represent the ‘voice of Bataan’,” because of this strong desire, fueled by the obstacles caused by the Great Depression. Bulosan's writings reached a wide audience, many of whom were feeling similar strife due to the state of the nation’s economy. The agriculture community in the West, especially in California, was characterized by a deficit in jobs and a life of transience. Bulosan’s writing provides an accurate first-hand description of the uncertainty of a migrant’s life, and while there is speculation about the amount of truth in his writing, one cannot deny that he was exposed first-hand to the struggles of The Great Depression.\n\n\"America Is in the Heart\" serves as a piece of activist literature. It sheds light on the racial and class issues that affected Filipino immigrants throughout the beginning of the twentieth century. The autobiography attempts to show Filipino Americans the structure of American society and the oppression inflicted upon Filipino’s living in America. E. San Juan, Jr., in “Carlos Bulosan, Filipino Writer-Activist”, states, “American administrators, social scientist, intellectuals, and others made sense of Filipinos: we were (like American Indians) savages, half childish primitives, or innocuous animals that can be either civilized with rigorous tutelage or else slaughtered outright”. In \"America Is in the Heart\", Bulosan properly shows the reader the animalistic treatment that was inflicted upon the Filipino's on the west coast. Bulosan states, “At that time, there was ruthless persecution of the Filipinos throughout the Pacific Coast”. He wants Filipinos and even white Americans to realize the harmful treatment of Filipinos and the problems of society.\n\nBulosan continues his activism through irony in his novel. “Behind the triumphant invocation of a mythical 'America' linger the unforgettable images of violence, panicked escape, horrible mutilation, and death in Bulosan’s works”. Throughout his novel, Bulosan mentions the death and violence that is inflicted upon Filipino immigrants. After being informed of a labor camp being burned down, he states, “I understood it to be a racial issue, because everywhere I went I saw white men attacking Filipinos”. He later stated, “Why was America so kind and yet so cruel?” Though America was supposed to be a place of freedom and kindness for Filipino Americans to escape to, Filipinos were treated like savages and were oppressed by white Americans. Bulosan makes this clear in his novel in order to present these problems to society.\n\nThroughout his career, Carlos Bulosan has provided examples of the Filipino American identity that affected future Filipino American and the issues they approached. In 1942, \"Chorus For America: Six Filipino Poets\" became the first Filipino poetry anthology published in America. It was based on the works of Bulosan and five other poets. At a time when Asians were being persecuted in America, Bulosan was attempting to distinguish Filipino-Americans from the umbrella term “Asian-American”. \"America Is in the Heart\" speaks to this struggle to retain one's identity in a new world. The graphic and gritty description of the Filipino town Bibalonan shocked the readers into realizing its distinction. It is a “damned town” where women are stoned to death and babies are left unwanted by the wayside. \"America Is in the Heart\" described the indelible mark a person's background has on his or her life, highlighting the failures of generalizing racial identities.\n\nIronically, it is Bulosan's success and \"America Is in the Heart’s\" dominance in the study of Filipino-American literature that may have a greater impact of then his actual words. There is great debate whether the agenda for Filipino American writers should be, “to exile themselves from the home country or to accept the status of a hyphenated American or to find a bridge between the two.” King-Kok Cheung believes that Bulosan is so celebrated due to a lack of attention to Filipino American writers “whose exilic writings did not fit with the immigrant ethos” of America. One of Bulosan's most important themes as a writer was the importance to find one's identity in America. Bulosan reveals his faith and love for America in the end of \"America Is in the Heart\". This sentiment is repeated in an essay entitled Be American, where Bulosan described American citizenship as a “most cherished dream”. Even if his writing did seem more conducive to the accepted image of immigrants, Bulosan opened the door for later writers to push the envelope of acceptance. Filipino-American writers of more recent years, such as Ninotchka Rosca and Linda Ty-Casper, have continued to highlight the complexity of a totally unified Filipino-American identity.\n\n\n"}

The film follows Grace Beasley, an archetypal timid and repressed homemaker who, in the wake of a sudden, unexpected marital separation and her favorite pop star's untimely death, takes a plane to England to attend the entertainer's funeral. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 23 August 2002.\n\nGrace Beasley has been content with life as a housewife. One morning, Grace wins tickets to a concert by her favorite singer. Grace is ecstatic, but soon learns her husband is leaving her, and also that her son is leaving his wife. Grace arrives at the concert, only to learn it has been cancelled due to the murder of the singer. Grace decides to travel to England for the singer's funeral. She soon meets the closeted singer's former lover and they plot to secretly change his burial clothing to his beloved pink bathrobe. Grace and Dirk then leave for Chicago and track down and kill the Cross Bow Killer, who has been murdering singers. The adventure transforms Grace, and she faces the problems of her marriage with a new outlook on the meaning of love.\n\n\nThe film was shot in late 1999 and early 2000 in Chicago and England, but New Line Cinema continually postponed the American release, leaving the film on the shelf until finally premiering it on the Starz network in August 2003 and then sending it direct-to-DVD that October. The film has generally received negative reviews from film critics.\n\nChristopher Mull wrote, \"It's a sloppy mishmash of stories...none of which stand on their own and which crash disastrously when combined. Bates comes off as dippy and distant. Everett comes of [sic] as mean and crusty. Pryce is just inexplicable with a gray pompadour and blue sequins. And Manilow rocks.

There are a few moments in this film that had me laughing quite hysterically. Merely the sight of Jonathan Pryce shuffle-dancing through clouds over the opening credits loads the film with promise. And Meredith Eaton as Maudey steals every scene she's in. But in the end, you can't escape the fact that Bates has difficulty carrying this movie and in fact, doesn't seem to really understand the type of film she's in.\"\n\nThe film is available on DVD and includes the film's trailer, and a deleted scene.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2221428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221428", "title": "Intelligence Identities Protection Act", "text": "Intelligence Identities Protection Act\n\nThe Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (, ) is a United States federal law that makes it a federal crime for those with access to classified information, or those who systematically seek to identify and expose covert agents and have reason to believe that it will harm the foreign intelligence activities of the U.S., to intentionally reveal the identity of an agent whom one knows to be in or recently in certain covert roles with a U.S. intelligence agency, unless the United States has publicly acknowledged or revealed the relationship.\nThe law was written, in part, as a response to several incidents where Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents or officers' identities were revealed. Under then existing law, such disclosures were legal when they did not involve the release of classified information. In 1975, CIA Athens station chief Richard Welch was assassinated by the Greek urban guerrilla group November 17 after his identity was revealed in several listings by a magazine called \"CounterSpy,\" edited by Timothy Butz. A local paper checked with \"CounterSpy\" to confirm his identity. However, the linkage between the publication of Welch's name and his assassination has been challenged by pundits that claim he was residing in a known CIA residency.\n\nAnother major impetus to pass the legislation was the activities of ex-CIA case officer Philip Agee during the 1960s and 1970s. Agee's book \"CIA Diary\" and his publication of the \"Covert Action Information Bulletin\" blew the cover of many agents. Some commentators say the law was specifically targeted at his actions, and one Congressman, Bill Young, said during a House debate, \"What we're after today are the Philip Agees of the world.\"\n\nThe law passed the House by a vote of 315–32, with all opposing votes coming from Democrats. The law passed the Senate 81–4, with the opponents being Democratic Senators Joe Biden, Gary Hart, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and Republican Senator Charles Mathias. Biden had written an op-ed column in the Christian Science Monitor published on April 6, 1982 that criticized the proposed law as harmful to national security.\n\n, there have been only two successful prosecutions involving the statute. In 1985, Sharon Scranage, a secretary in the CIA's office in Accra, Ghana, was sentenced to five years and served eight months, for giving the names of other agents to her boyfriend in Ghana. In January, 2013 John C. Kiriakou, a former CIA officer, who accepted a plea bargain, is serving a prison sentence for disclosing the name of another CIA officer to a reporter.\n\nThe criminal provisions of the act are contained in 50 U.S.C. § 421. During Congress's consideration of the measure, much attention is paid to subsection 421(c), which states:\n\nUnder this subsection, journalists and political commentators alike could be prosecuted should they show an effort towards discovering or revealing identities of covert agents. However, it was ultimately concluded by the Senate Judiciary and the Conference Committee that the measure is constitutionally sound. Individuals would only be prosecuted if they engage in a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents, on the grounds that such actions goes beyond information that might contribute to informed public debate on foreign policy or foreign intelligence activities.\n\nThe Conference Committee assured that U.S. intelligence critics would be beyond the reach of law so long as they do not actively seek to identify or expose covert agents. However, commentators are still wary of the measure, finding 421(c) standard over-broad since it lacks a 'specific intent requirement' and instead relies on a 'reason to believe' standard.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2007, an investigation was conducted by prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald into whether this law and others were violated in the identification of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative in a 2003 newspaper column by Robert Novak. As a result of the investigation, former Vice Presidential Chief-of-Staff \"Scooter\" Libby was convicted on two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice and one count of making false statements to federal investigators and sentenced to thirty months in jail. In a court filing related to Libby's sentencing, the CIA stated that Plame was a covert agent at the time of the leak. In addition, the leak enabled the identification of Plame as an employee of the CIA front company, Brewster Jennings & Associates, and in doing so enabled the identification of other CIA agents who were \"employed\" there.\n\nIn 2011 Ray Nowosielski and John Duffy of SecrecyKills.org planned to release an audio documentary entitled \"Who is Rich Blee?\", focusing on the CIA's Bin Ladin unit before 9/11, and the way certain CIA officials blocked information on 9/11 hijackers from reaching the FBI before 9/11. In the documentary they planned to reveal the identity of two CIA agents. One of them is \"Frances\", the red-headed CIA agent mentioned in several reports on the War on Terror, including Jane Mayer's The Dark Side and an AP news story from 2011 about the Khalid El-Masri case. However, after receiving threats under the IIPA, Duffy and Nowosielski decided to release the documentary with the names redacted. The CIA threatened them with prosecution. They claim that their webmaster later posted an email containing the identities by accident. The identities then spread to the wider Internet.\n\nA former CIA officer, John Kiriakou, was charged and convicted under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act. On Tuesday, October 23, 2012 Kiriakou pleaded guilty to violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.\n\nAs part of a plea agreement, Kiriakou accepted a 30-month prison term, while the charges filed under the Espionage Act were dropped. He was sentenced on January 25, 2013. This was the first conviction of a CIA officer under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act in 27 years.\n\n\n"}

It was a member of the Socialist International.\n\nThe MIR was founded in 1971 by a merger of a left-wing faction of Bolivia's Christian Democratic Party and the radical student wing of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR). It has been led from the beginning by Jaime Paz Zamora. The MIR was becoming influential in the labor movement and politics during the early 1970s, but it was repressed by the government of Hugo Banzer later in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1978, the MIR joined the left-of-center UDP alliance of former president Hernán Siles Zuazo. After a few years of unstable military rule, Siles Zuazo was proclaimed Constitutional President in 1982, based on the results of the 1980 elections, which had been annulled by general Luis García Meza. The MIR's Jaime Paz Zamora accompanied Dr. Siles as his Vice-President. During the dire economic crisis that coincided with the coming to power of the UDP, Siles became considerably unpopular. At this point (1984), the MIR—led by Vice-President Paz Zamora—left the governing alliance and moved into the opposition. Prior to the 1985 elections, a faction of the party led by Antonio Araníbar left the party on ideological grounds and formed the rival Free Bolivia Movement. The faction of the MIR that remained loyal to Paz Zamora referred to itself as the MIR-New Majority, and espoused a much more moderate program than before, having disassociated itself from Marxist dogmas and any notion of class struggle.\n\nThe MIR was revitalized when it became one of the most vocal critics of the austerity and neoliberal measures of the president that followed Siles, Víctor Paz Estenssoro of the MNR. After the 1989 elections, the MIR at long last attained the presidency of Bolivia, despite having finished third in the popular vote. Since no party had obtained the 50% majority needed for direct election, Congress was called upon to decide who should be Chief Executive; Paz Zamora got the nod, thanks to a most unlikely alliance with a former enemy, the right-wing candidate General Hugo Banzer. Perhaps limited by this co-governing pact with Banzer (called the Patriotic Accord), President Jaime Paz Zamora followed much of the course set by the MNR, disappointing many former adherents.\n\nLike the other traditionally dominant parties in Bolivia (such as the MNR and Banzer's Nationalist Democratic Action, or ADN), the MIR has lost ground in recent years. One of its most important leaders, Oscar Eid, even went to jail for links to narcotics trafficking, further tarnishing the party. Indeed, the MIR lost so much support that it chose not to run candidates for the 2005 presidential elections. Instead, it chose to focus its efforts in local and provincial contests. They are not doing particularly well in that sphere either.\n\nThe current leader of the MIR continues to be former President Jaime Paz Zamora, but the party's future is uncertain.\n"}

{"id": "2221462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221462", "title": "Oregon Route 219", "text": "Oregon Route 219\n\nOregon Route 219 (also known as part of the Hillsboro-Silverton Highway No. 140 (see Oregon highways and routes)) is an Oregon state highway which runs between the cities of Hillsboro and Woodburn, Oregon, in the United States. The Hillsboro-Silverton Highway continues further south to Silverton, signed as OR 214. The highway mainly serves local residents and agricultural traffic; despite its proximity to the Portland area it lies outside the Portland Urban Growth Boundary (except for its northern terminus in Hillsboro) and so maintains its character as a country road.\n\nOR 219's southern terminus is at the junction with Interstate 5 and OR 214 in the city of Woodburn. (A single diamond interchange serves both OR 219 and OR 214 from the freeway; OR 219 leads west of the interchange and OR 214 heads east.) After passing a collection of shopping malls and motel chains around the Woodburn exit, OR 219 starts winding its way through the Marion County countryside, heading in a northwesterly direction. As the area is primarily regular-platted farmland, the alignment of OR 219 heads west for a while, then turns north, then turns west again; the route contains numerous 90-degree turns.\n\nThe next city encountered is the city of St. Paul. From St. Paul, the highway heads north and then northeast, parallel to (but at some distance from) the Willamette River. At this point the road is known as the St. Paul Highway. After the intersections with McKay Road and Champeog Road (which provides access to Champoeg State Heritage Area), the route crosses the Willamette River. Soon after crossing the river, the highway enters the city of Newberg. \n\nIn Newberg, the route intersects OR 18 (the Newberg-Dundee Bypass) before it joins (and overlaps) OR 99W along the Pacific Highway West No. 1W, and the combined route then heads westward into the city center (when one travels on the concurrent section, one is simultaneously heading north on OR 219 and south on OR 99W, or vice versa). In downtown Newberg, the route enters a one-way couplet; and then OR 219 splits apart from OR 99W again, and heads north.\n\nImmediately north of Newberg, the route enters a steep, narrow, twisty section as it climbs out of the Willamette Valley into the hills overlooking the town. Soon the road levels out again as OR 219 descends into the Tualatin Valley. The next named location is Scholls, where the route intersects with OR 210. Keeping on OR 219, one then heads in a general northwesterly direction, running parallel to the western bank of the Tualatin River. Just northwest of the intersection with OR 210 is Brown's Corner, followed by the 90 degree turn at the Midway Curve. The state plans to re-work those curves to improve safety.\n\nAfter OR 210, the next major route encountered is OR 10, just west of Farmington. About five miles (8 km) after that, OR 219 enters the city of Hillsboro as it crosses the Tualatin River and passes by Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve. Entering downtown Hillsboro, OR 219 becomes South 1st Street before ending at the intersection with Oregon Route 8, the Tualatin Valley Highway. Mile marker numbering begins here as zero, with numbers increasing as the road stretches to the south.\n\nOR 18 (the \"Newberg-Dundee Bypass\") intersected Oregon Route 219 south of Newberg when it opens in Winter, 2018.\n\nIn 1989, Washington County renamed the road in the county from Oregon 219 to Hillsboro Highway. This was part of an effort to improve response times by emergency services.\n\nOne significant alignment change occurred during the 1990s. It used to be the case that OR 219, rather than running between St. Paul and Woodburn, instead continued south along French Prairie Road and River Road to Salem, Oregon, where it terminated in the northern part of Salem, near the Keizer city line at an intersection with the Salem Parkway (and, prior to the parkway's construction, down Broadway and High Streets to the corner of High Street and the Marion/Center Street street couplet downtown, where Highways 22 and 99E used to run). An extension of OR 214 connected Woodburn with St. Paul. However, that section of OR 219 is no longer marked as a state route. Many maps (including Yahoo Maps) still show the old alignment of OR 219.\n\nNote: mileposts do not reflect actual mileage due to realignments.\n"}
{"id": "2221463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221463", "title": "Double Dribble (video game)", "text": "Double Dribble (video game)\n\nDouble Dribble, known in Japan as , is a basketball arcade game developed and released in 1986 by Konami. It was the second basketball arcade game by Konami, following \"Super Basketball\". Much of the game's popularity came from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam dunks, as well as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" theme during attract mode, which was the first arcade game to feature the national anthem. These were uncommon in video games at the time of \"Double Dribble\"'s release. While successful in the arcades, the game became and remained popular and remembered when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987.\n\n\"Double Dribble\" was followed by a sequel titled \"\", which was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. A remake titled \"Double Dribble Fastbreak\" was released for iOS in 2010, being based mostly on the NES version; however, the animation sequences were ripped from the arcade version.\n\nLike its predecessor, you are in control of a five-man basketball team playing against the computer controlled team, or controlled by a second player. When a coin is inserted, a credit was indicated on the bottom of the screen, and there would be a time left indication of one minute, and it would show where in a quarter you would be, time-wise. From there, when you hit start, you would enter in your initials, like Super Basketball did, and then the game would start.\n\nThe gameplay is a marked difference and improvement from its predecessor, Super Basketball. The characters looked better, and moved much better around the court. Like a traditional basketball game, the centers would come out to the middle of the court, and the referee would institute a jump ball and the game would start in earnest.\n\nThe goal for Double Dribble is to have scored more points than the computer team by the time your time runs out, which meant that the game would give you another minute of time, and the game would continue. The game would get harder, and would do so *very* quickly. If the computer team had as many points as your team or more when time ran out, the game would end.\n\nThe controls are an 8 way joystick, and three buttons. One to dribble the ball on offense, one to pass the ball on offense, and one to shoot the ball on offense. On defense, the dribble button became the steal button, the pass button became the switch button to switch players, and the shoot button became the jump button.\n\nIf you are on offense: To move your player that has the ball, you repeatedly hit the dribble button while moving the joystick in a certain direction. To pass the ball, you moved the joystick in the direction of your teammate (who would have an aura in your teams color surround him) and press the pass button. To shoot the ball (outside of the lane, which we will get to), you pressed and held the shoot button until the player reached the top of the jump, and then release it.\n\nIf you were in the lane and moving toward the basket and you hit the shot button, the screen would change to the player attempting a dunk. You would hold the button down until the player reached the top of the jump and release it. If your timing was right, you would complete the dunk. If not, the ball will bounce high and far off the rim, and you would need to rebound the ball.\n\nEach player moves at slightly different speeds, and their jumps are different. Some jump high, while some don't get far off the ground. Some rise quickly, others rise slowly. If you learn their high points, you can master their jump shots, dunks, and also get good at rebounds, which is important at later stages of the game.\n\nIf you are on defense: if you are guarding a player, you can try to steal the ball from him by moving towards the ball and hitting the steal button. If done correctly, you would steal the ball and the game would say “Nice Steal!” and then you are on offense. There is a chance that while doing this you could foul the player and send him to the free throw line.\n\nIf you needed to switch players, you would move the joystick towards the player you wanted and press the pass button, and you would be instantly switched that player.\n\nWhen the opposing team takes a shot, if you are near to him, press the shot button. If will cause your player to jump and possibly block the shot. Also, if a shot is missed, move your player under the shadow of the ball and press the shot button to attempt to rebound the basketball.\n\nIf you player gets fouled (and it can happen on offense or defense), he is sent to the free throw line. Five players will take their places on opposing sides of the lane, with your player at the free throw line. You have five seconds for each free throw attempt. A ring starts above the basket, and when you press and hold the shoot button, the ring descends towards the basket. The trick is to get the ring as close to the basket as possible in order to make the free throw. As with their jumps, each player's ring descends at  different speeds.\n\nAs with a real NBA game, the game is divided into four quarters at 12 minutes per quarter. After the end of each quarter there is a challenging stage, which is a three-point shootout. As with a real life three-point contest, you have a player attempting five three point shots at each corner, each wing, and from the top of the key for a total of 25 shots. You press and hold the shoot button until the player reaches the top of his jump, and then release it. Each shot you make adds 1 second to your time remaining for a total of 25 seconds, and you make them all 1 minute is added to your time as well. Play then continues until the player runs out of time while having fewer points that the opposing team or is tied.\n\nThe high score table was unique, in that you could get on the table by scoring a lot of points, shooting a high percentage either in-game or from the free throw line, grabbing a lot of rebounds, dishing out assists, or by committing the fewest number of fouls. You still had to score more points that the lowest score on the high score table to qualify, however.\n\nSeveral positions on the court were 'hot spots,' high-percentage areas where shots taken were likely to score points (e.g., \"a fade-away, banked 3-pointer\"). For example: it is easier to hit a 3-pointer on the bottom right-hand side of the screen. A player could start a 3-point jump shot from the top right or left corner of the court inbounds, and continue the jump out of bounds and even slightly behind the hoop and it would go in nearly every time. Another nearly guaranteed shot is taken with the player standing 3-quarters length of the court away from their goal could go for a running 3-point shot, provided that the shot button was pressed within the other team's free throw shooting circle. In certain circumstances, the display would break away from the full court action and show a close-up of the players either dunking the ball or making a shot. Frequently a player would miss a slam dunk, which is a very high percentage shot. The arcade version was a timed play (much like \"Star Fire\"), where after every minute of play, the game was owed a credit if the score was tied or the computer is ahead. However, if the live player was ahead, a \"free\" minute was earned. Many average players could earn the first free minute, but this became increasingly more difficult to do as making 3-point shots became virtually impossible over the course of gameplay.\n\nPlayers can choose from one of four teams: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. There is no difference in skill level or abilities between the teams. Since there is no NBA license, no team names or player names are used; however, the teams wear the same color of their NBA counterparts (Boston wears green, Chicago red, etc.). In short, the game control scheme is simple but it takes practice to get the hang of the timing scheme of the game.\n\nCompared to many sports-related Nintendo games of this era, \"Double Dribble\" resembled its sport with surprising accuracy. However, there were several quirks in the programming that are noteworthy, if only for their contribution to the overall experience of playing \"Double Dribble\". The game clock, as in most early timed video games (see also: \"Tecmo Bowl\"), was accelerated (far faster than real-time). In the third quarter, third is abbreviated as \"3rt.\" In addition, the color of a player's skin can change mid-game. This is the result of the strobing animation that takes place when controlling an individual player, which takes place by way of cycling quickly back and forth between the two skin tones.\n\nThe game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in September 1987, which was later released in Japan in Disk Card format for the Family Computer Disk System under the title of Exciting Basketball. The NES version features 5-on-5 action on a horizontally scrolling court, four teams (Boston Frogs, New York Eagles, Chicago Ox, Los Angeles Breakers), three levels of single-play difficulty, and four choices of quarter lengths. \"Double Dribble\" was among the first games to feature cut scenes, which depicted a mid-air player completing a slam dunk, and one of the first to use speech, though in a limited quantity (such as announcing the game title, the game's beginning jump ball, and some foul calls). \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in this version was slightly altered, while it was being played in a cut scene depicting the crowd entering the stadium before the menu pops up. The NES version was ported to the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on November 16, 2007, and in North America on November 26, 2007.\n\nIn 1990, the game was ported to three home computers: the Commodore 64, the Commodore Amiga and MS-DOS operated PCs.\n\nIn 1991, a Game Boy version was released titled Double Dribble 5-on-5.\n\nA Genesis version was released in 1994 titled Double Dribble: Playoff Edition (Hyperdunk in Japan and Europe).\n\nA remake for iPhone OS titled Double Dribble Fast Break was released in 2010.\n\n\"Double Dribble\" has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Allgame awarded the game 5 out of 5 stars. The review referred to the game as the most realistic rendition of basketball on its release, and that it \"was the beginning of a new era for sports games in which presentation played an increasingly important role. Once you get a glimpse of the innovative, cinema-style dunk attempts, there's no denying its place in history.\" GameSpot editor Frank Provo displayed mixed feelings towards the game, emphasizing that once you rack up a few minutes of play time, you'll start noticing some nasty design quirks that ultimately force you to play the game a certain way. Provo also criticized the computer player's unfair ability to catch up with the player.\n\nGameplay of \"Double Dribble\" was featured in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Run, Chris, Run\". The \"Double Dribble\" footage was slightly altered with original audio, and made fun of the game's \"corner three\" glitch. The episode also used gameplay footage from \"Tecmo Super Bowl\", exploiting Bo Jackson's pace.\n\n"}

After graduating, Britton spent two more years working in off-Broadway theatre productions. In 1995, Britton made her feature film debut in Edward Burns' comedy-drama \"The Brothers McMullen\". She moved to Los Angeles after the film's success.\n\nAfter \"The Brothers McMullen\", Britton was cast as Heather in a recurring role in the ABC sitcom \"Ellen\", and starred as Cammie Barbash in the unsold Fox pilot \"Pins and Needles\". In 1996, she began co-starring as Nikki Faber in the ABC sitcom \"Spin City\" opposite Michael J. Fox. Her character was written out of the show when Charlie Sheen replaced Fox. She also appeared in the romantic comedy-drama \"No Looking Back\" (1998) and the mystery comedy-drama \"Looking for Kitty\" (2004), both directed by Edward Burns. In 2001, she co-starred opposite Chris Eigeman and Jamie Harris in the romantic comedy \"The Next Big Thing\". She later co-starred in the independent films \"The Life Coach\", \"Special Ed\", \"The Lather Effect\" and \"The Last Winter\".\n\nAfter leaving \"Spin City\", Britton had a recurring role as Maggie Kimble Hume in the short-lived CBS crime drama \"The Fugitive\". In 2001, she played Gertrude Temple, Shirley Temple's bad mother in the ABC television film \"Child Star: The Shirley Temple Story\", based on Temple's 1988 autobiography. In the same year, she starred as Sophie Fitzgerald in the short-lived NBC sitcom \"The Fighting Fitzgeralds\". In 2001, Britton also had a recurring role in the NBC political drama \"The West Wing\" in the third season, appearing in the two-part premiere titled \"Manchester\" and the sixth episode titled \"Gone Quiet\" as Connie Tate, a member of Bruno Gianelli's team. In 2002, she returned to ABC and starred as Rachel Davis in the short-lived sitcom \"Lost at Home\". In 2006, she had a recurring role in the Fox espionage thriller \"24\" in the fifth season as Diane Huxley, a landlady and a brief girlfriend of Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland).\n\nBritton co-starred opposite Kyle Chandler in the NBC/DirecTV drama series \"Friday Night Lights\" as Tami Taylor, the wife of a head football coach Eric Taylor (Chandler), who becomes a high school guidance counselor. The show ran for five seasons from October 3, 2006 to February 9, 2011. During that time, Britton developed a devoted following for her performance – described by \"The New York Times\" as \"something of an icon, a 40-something sex symbol and role model.\" She was first cast opposite Billy Bob Thornton in the film version of the series, \"Friday Night Lights\" (2004). For her role in the show, she was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2010 and 2011, for TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama in 2007 and 2008, and was awarded Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 2010.\n\nIn 2009, Britton co-starred opposite Carla Gugino and her \"Friday Night Lights\" co-star Adrianne Palicki in the comedy \"Women in Trouble\", and co-starred opposite Jackie Earle Haley, Kyle Gallner and Rooney Mara in the 2010 remake of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" as Dr. Gwendoline \"Gwen\" Holbrook. In 2011, she co-starred opposite Pamela Adlon in the romantic comedy \"Conception\". She appeared on the WBEZ radio reading show \"This American Life\" 429th episode, \"Will They Know Me at Home?\", in which she performed monologues from David Finkel's nonfiction book \"The Good Soldiers\".\n\nIn 2011, Britton starred in the first season in the FX horror drama \"American Horror Story\". She played Vivien Harmon, who relocates with her family to California after a series of tragic marital and family issues. Unfortunately for The Harmons, the new house they purchase quickly reveals itself to be haunted. For this role she was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie in 2012. Britton had stated when she wrapped \"American Horror Story\" she would be taking a couple of months off to be with her new adopted son, but that she would then begin to re-focus on developing her FX drama collaboration with David O. Russell, but the project went into \"development hell\".\nOn March 6, 2012, Britton signed on to star in and produce the ABC/CMT musical drama series, \"Nashville\" created by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri. The series ran on ABC and CMT for six seasons from October 10, 2012 to July 26, 2018. She played Rayna Jaymes, a 40-year-old renowned country singer whose stardom is beginning to fade. Britton's performance received critical praise, and she was nominated for a fourth time for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for the first time for this role. Britton, for her part, said that the most nerve-wracking part of her role, at least in the beginning, was the singing the role requires of her. The show was cancelled in May 2016 by ABC. However, in June 2016, CMT picked up the series for a fifth season. In February 2017, Britton left \"Nashville\" during the fifth season, but returned for the series finale in July 2018 as a guest star.\n\nIn 2012, Britton co-starred opposite Edward Burns in the comedy-drama \"The Fitzgerald Family Christmas\". The film was met with positive reviews from critics. That same year, she had co-starred in the comedy-drama \"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World\" opposite Steve Carell and Keira Knightley.\n\nIn 2013, Britton co-starred opposite Aubrey Plaza in the comedy \"The To Do List\", where she played the mother of Plaza's character. Britton returned to Austin, Texas, where \"Friday Night Lights\" was filmed, to co-star opposite Harry Connick Jr. and fellow actors and musicians Willie Nelson, Lyle Lovett and Kris Kristofferson in the Christmas family drama \"Angels Sing\". In 2014, Britton co-starred opposite Adam Driver as a cougar therapist in the comedy-drama \"This Is Where I Leave You\", based on Jonathan Tropper's 2009 best-selling novel.\n\nIn 2015, she co-starred opposite Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke in the comedy-drama \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\", directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and based on Jesse Andrews'‍ 2012 novel of the same name, a wry coming-of-age story about Greg (Mann), a teenage oddball forced to befriend Rachel (Cooke), a classmate with leukemia. She played Greg's mother. That same year, she co-starred in the action comedy \"American Ultra\" opposite Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart; Sharon Stone had originally been cast in her part.\n\nIn 2016, Britton reunited with \"American Horror Story\" creator Ryan Murphy in his miniseries \"American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson\" as Faye Resnick. In 2017, guest starred as Ally in the Showtime comedy series \"SMILF\". Also in 2017, Britton starred in the comedy-drama film \"Beatriz at Dinner\" and the biographical drama \"Professor Marston and the Wonder Women\". In 2018, she co-starred in the comedy-drama film \"The Land of Steady Habits\". \n\nAlso in 2018, Britton starred as emergency dispatcher Abby Clark in the first season of the Fox procedural drama \"9-1-1\", her third collaboration with Ryan Murphy. The same year, she returned to \"American Horror Story\" for the eighth season, \"\", reprising her role as . She also co-starred opposite Eric Bana as Debra Newell in the Bravo true crime anthology series \"Dirty John\", for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nBritton uses her married name as her stage name. She met investment banker John Britton at Alpha Delta House at Dartmouth College. They moved to Manhattan together in 1989, married on October 5, 1991, and divorced in 1995.\n\nIn 1993, Britton joined the New York Junior League and was a member of the 1993 provisional class of volunteers where she listed her occupation as \"Actress\".\n\nIn November 2011, Britton adopted a son, Eyob \"Yoby\" Britton, from Ethiopia.\n\nWhile at Dartmouth in the late 1980s, Britton studied Chinese and lived for a summer in Beijing with future US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. She later endorsed Gillibrand in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and appeared with her at campaign events. In a 2012 interview on NPR, Britton said of the experience: \"I always wanted to be an actor. But when I went to college, I had to fulfill a language requirement and so I thought it would be really cool to do it speaking Chinese. My Chinese these days is real, real shaky. Let's put it this way: these days, my singing is better than my Chinese.\"\n\nBritton moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2012 when she signed to star in the ABC/CMT musical drama \"Nashville\".\n\nOn April 2, 2014, Britton became the 10th Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Development Programme, the anti-poverty agency of the UN. She joins celebrities such as Antonio Banderas, Maria Sharapova, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo in the role of UNDP Goodwill Ambassador. She focuses her advocacy efforts on eradicating extreme poverty, fighting exclusion and empowering women.\n\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Britton and others told the stories of the people killed there.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221477", "title": "Glanville fritillary", "text": "Glanville fritillary\n\nThe Glanville fritillary (\"Melitaea cinxia\") is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae. It is named for the naturalist who discovered it and the checkerboard pattern on its wings. These butterflies live in almost all of Europe especially Finland and in parts of northwest Africa. They are absent from the far north of Europe and parts of the Iberian Peninsula. East they are found across the Palearctic (in Turkey , Russia , northern Kazakhstan and Mongolia). \n\nIt has been discovered that this butterfly only mates one time in June or July and lays its eggs. It does not provide any protection to these eggs or care for the offspring. As adults, the Glanville fritillaries are short lived; they spend most of their lives as caterpillars. As caterpillars, Glanville fritillaries enter a stage of diapause, which is a period of suspended development, during the winter time.\n\nThe spiked speedwell and ribwort plantain are the Glanville fritillary's preferred plants to lay eggs and to eat as larvae. Female butterflies will show a preference for one plant species over the other when deciding where to lay their eggs, but the caterpillars have no preference once they hatch. After entering the adult phase the fritillaries feed on nectar of the spiked speedwell and ribwort plantain, among others.\n\nThis species of butterfly is at risk of population decline because it is not a migratory species. Though widespread, populations in Finland are at risk because they are not able to travel great distances as easily as other species, such as monarchs, if their environment should suddenly become unsuitable.\n\nThe word \"fritillary\" refers to the checkered pattern of the butterfly's wings, which comes from the Latin word \"fritillus\" which means \"dicebox\". The name \"Glanville\" comes from the naturalist who discovered it, Lady Eleanor Glanville. Lady Eleanor Glanville was an eccentric 17th- and 18th-century English butterfly enthusiast – a very unusual occupation for a woman at that time. She was the first to capture British specimens in Lincolnshire during the 1690s. A contemporary wrote\n\nThe Glanville fritillary is found across Europe and temperate Asia. It is most commonly found on the Åland Islands of Finland, which host a network of about 4,000 dry meadows, the fritillary's ideal habitat. These butterflies commonly inhabit open grassland at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nIn the UK the Glanville fritillary occurs only on soft undercliff and chine grassland and where its main larval food plant \"Plantago lanceolata\" (English plantain) occurs in abundance on sheltered, south facing slopes. The Glanville fritillary is a highly restricted species within the UK, being confined to the Isle of Wight and even there being largely limited to the southern coast. It also occurs in the Channel Islands, and since 1990 there has been a mainland site on the Hampshire coast, possibly the result of an introduction. There are small introduced populations on the Somerset coast and two in Surrey: one near Wrecclesham, and one at a nature reserve in Addington, near Croydon.\n\nHistoric UK records suggest a distribution which went as far north as Lincolnshire. However, by the middle of the 19th century the Glanville fritillary was known only from the Isle of Wight and the coast of Kent between Folkestone and Sandwich. It became extinct in Kent by the mid-1860s.\n\n\"Melitaea cinxia\" has a wingspan of about . These medium-sized butterflies have orange, black and white \"checkerspot\" forewings. On the upperside of the hindwings they have a row of black dots. The hindwings have white and orange bands and a series of black dots inside them, also clearly visible on the reverse. Females are usually more dull than males with more developed black dots. In Seitz it is described - \"M. cinxia\" L. (65 e, f). Above uniformly pale yellowish red, marked with black, somewhat recalling a chess-board, the white fringes being checkered.A row of heavy black dots in the submarginal row of spots on the hindwing is characteristic. Excepting the pale yellow black-dotted apex, the forewing beneath uniformly reddish leather-yellow, with dispersed blackspots, which vary in number. The species though of wide distribution, has not developed into many races.\n\nCaterpillars are about 25 mm long with a reddish-brown head and a spiny black body with small white dots.\n\n\"Melitaea cinxia\" is rather similar to the heath fritillary (\"Melitaea athalia\"), but the beige and orange bands on the underwings are distinctive. Moreover, the latter one has no spots on the upperside of the hindwings.\n\nAfter hatching, Glanville fritillary caterpillars live in gregarious sibling groups. They feed on their host plant, either \"Plantoago lanceolata\" (ribwort plantain) or \"Veronica spicata\" (spiked speedwell). Adult females prefer one plant over the other when choosing where to lay their eggs, but the larvae do not have a feeding preference for either plant when they are born.\n\nAs an attempt to fend off predators and parasitoids, the spiked speedwell emits volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when threatened. Some researchers found that this plant species has two different defenses for when it is being fed on and when a butterfly is in oviposition. The oviposition of the butterfly on this plant was able to induce the increase of two ketones (6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and t-geranylacetone) and the suppression of green leaf volatiles (GLVs).\n\nAdult Glanville fritillaries have a diet that consists solely of nectar. It has been shown that larvae with higher amounts of iridoid glycosides have better defense against parasitoids and bacterial pathogens.\n\nAdult Glanville fritillaries take flight, mate, and lay their eggs from June to early July. During this time it has been found that females only mate once. Females also tend to mate in their natal groups before dispersing with a mate to lay their eggs in a different population. This dispersal helps induce genetic flow between populations on the fragmented meadows of the Åland Islands.\n\nA female Glanville fritillary will lay as many as 10 clutches of eggs in her lifetime. These clutches can range in size from 50 up to 300 eggs and are laid on the underside of the larval food plant of either \"Plantago lanceolata\" (ribwort plantain) or \"Veronica spicata\" (spiked speedwell). After hatching, the caterpillars feed on their host plants until the end of the summer where they spin a \"winter nest\" to diapause. When winter is over they emerge from their nest to feed again before pupating around the beginning of May. A month later, the adult fritillaries emerge and go about their adult lives of feeding, mating, and laying eggs.\n\nIn the Glanville fritillary, clutch size is highly important as larval survival depends on groups size. Thus, understanding the different factors that contribute to clutch size is important in developing an understanding of population dynamics and life cycle.\n\nClutch size is inversely related to the size of the clutches previously laid, meaning that the more eggs a female lays in years prior, the fewer eggs will be in the present clutch. Further, it is known that clutch sizes decrease with the age of the female. This is thought to be due to resource depletion over time in the female, potentially from high investment in earlier clutches.\n\nClutch size also increases with increased intervals between oviposition. Typical Glanville fritillary oviposition occurs once every two days.\n\nGlanville fritillary females vary in their PGI, a glycolytic enzyme, genotype. The genotype of the female influences the time of day that she is active, which also influence her ability to lay larger clutches. Heterozygote females are able to operate earlier in the day compared to all other genotypes. Further, females with a \"Pgi-f\" allele are able to begin oviposition earlier in the day and are also able to lay larger clutch sizes. The \"Pgi-f\" allele contributes to a higher metabolic rate and the ability for females to take advantage of the climate of the early day - both of which factors allow for increased clutch size. \n\nGlanville fritillary eggs and pupae are often parasitized by several species of parasitoids. Two specialist species:\nAnd several generalist species:\nAnd has several hyperparasitoids\n\nThe parasitoid \"C. melitaearum\" can be extremely detrimental to Glanville fritillary populations if it is able to become well established. This species is able to increase its own parasitism if the fritillary population is also increasing in size and age, but will decrease if said population becomes isolated. Thus, in well established fritillary populations there is a risk of local extinction by the \"C. melitaearum\" parasitoid.\n\nSubspecies include:\n\nAs the global temperature of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward in order to keep living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which is something to keep in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.\n\nThis butterfly is not currently listed as threatened in Europe, but its UK BAP status is Priority Species. The NERC act of England lists it as species of principal importance. Its Butterfly Conservation priority is high, so this is a butterfly likely to be increasingly threatened in the coming years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2221512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2221512", "title": "Heath fritillary", "text": "Heath fritillary\n\nThe heath fritillary (\"Melitaea athalia\") is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae. It is found throughout the Palaearctic from western Europe to Japan, in heathland, grassland, and in coppiced woodland. Its association with coppiced woodland earned it the name \"woodman's follower\" in parts of the UK. It is considered a threatened species in the UK and Germany, but not Europe-wide or globally.\n\nHeath fritillaries have a wingspan of 39–47 mm. The upperside is predominantly dark brown and orange brown, with the orange-brown spots delineated by dark brown (along and across the wing veins); there is a white fringe to the wings through which the dark brown extends. The upperside of the body is a similar dark brown to the colour on the wing, and the base of both wings is dark brown. The underside shows bands of red and (off-)white, again with each vein dark brown and each colour delineated by dark brown. The pattern of white spots at the base of the hindwing (visible at rest) is diagnostic for identification.\n\nThese wing patterns are very similar to the appearance of \"Melitaea cinxia\". However, the dark brown bands on underside of the wings are more distinct in the health fritillary than in \"M. cinxia\". \n\nThe heath fritillary ranges throughout the Palaearctic region from western Europe to Japan. In Europe, it is absent from Iceland, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, southern Portugal, southern Spain, the Mediterranean islands and southern Greece.\n\nIn the UK, it is restricted to Cornwall and Devon grasslands (abandoned hay meadows); Exmoor (heathland); and Kent and Essex (coppiced woodland on acid soils). The populations in Essex are the result of reintroductions, and further reintroductions are ongoing in various other parts of the UK. In the late 1990s, the species was estimated to occupy just 0.2% within the 10-km grid squares over the whole of its UK range.\n\nIts altitudinal range is from sea level to 2600 m.\n\nHeath fritillary is not listed on the IUCN Red List, suggesting that globally it is not considered threatened. In the UK, however, the species was \"considered to be the most endangered British butterfly\" after a nationwide survey in 1980 found only 31 surviving colonies. Consequently, it was given protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Despite subsequent widespread efforts to conserve and manage the species' habitats, it has continued to decline: distribution has declined 25% since the 1970s, and abundance-wise it declined by 46% in the 10 years 1995–2004. Woodland sites in Kent and Essex are actively managed (coppiced) for the conservation of this species. It has been a \"high priority\" species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan since 1995 and has its own \"Species Action Plan\".\n\nHeath fritillary is also on the \"Red List\" in Germany.\n\nHowever, the species is considered of \"least concern\" on a European scale.\n\nWithin Europe, the heath fritillary occupies a diversity of grassy, flowery habitats—dry or damp, upland or lowland, with or without shrubs or trees, including woodland clearings and heathland.\n\nMore specifically, in England, this species occupies three distinct habitats:\n\n\nIn France, this species also occurs on unimproved hay meadows and pastures.\n\nHeath fritillaries typically fly close to the ground, with characteristic \"flits\" and glides. Colonies tend to be compact, centred on favoured breeding areas. Heath fritillaries are highly sedentary for the most part, adults rarely moving more than 100 m; however, some have been recorded dispersing up to 2 km. For a species of often short-lived habitats, it has remarkably limited colonizing ability; suitable habitats over 600 m from an existing colony are colonized slowly.\n\nThe female heath fritillary lays its eggs (or ova) in batches of (15–)80–150 on the underside of leaf of a larval food plant or on a plant adjacent to the larval food plant.\n\nEggs are oval spheroids with flattened bases, about 0.5 mm high. They are ribbed (longitudinally, i.e. from top to bottom) and striated (transversely, i.e. around the egg). Pale cream when laid, eggs darken to pale yellow within two days, and then dark grey a few days before hatching. Eggs mature in two to three weeks.\n\nUpon emergence, first-instar caterpillars (or larvae) eat their eggshells. The caterpillars from a clutch initially stay together, feeding in a small, unobtrusive web. Second or third instar caterpillars disperse into smaller groups. Then the third instars tend to feed and rest solitarily; they rest beneath dead leaves at night and during bad weather. The caterpillar hibernates for the winter in a hibernaculum, made from a curled dead leaf by spinning its edges together. Hibernacula are usually close to the ground. Although most caterpillars hibernate singly, they sometimes group in twos and threes, although 15 to 20 caterpillars have been found in single hibernaculum.\n\nCaterpillars re-emerge in early spring. When it is warm, they feed a little, but most of the time is spent basking in the sun. There are six instars in total. The full-grown sixth instar caterpillar is 22–25 mm long, and predominantly black; it has pale (yellow-orange) spines and (greyish-white) spots.\n\nThe pupae are 12.4–12.8 cm long and last 15–25 days (early May to late June in the UK). They are white with black and orange-brown blotches. Pupae are usually found close to the ground in or beneath dead leaves.\n\nA study in Cornwall, England, recorded mortality rates in the region of 50%, mostly from predation by small mammals, but including predation by beetles, and parasitism.\n\nImagines probably live for 5–10 days. Males are active on warm sunny days. Females mate once shortly after emerging; they lay their eggs only during warm weather, spending most of the time either basking or hiding in vegetation.\n\nAcross its range (see \"Subspecies and variation\" below), subspecies \"M. a. athalia\" shows a protracted flight period from mid-May to mid-August. In favourable localities and/or favourable seasons, a partial second brood has been recorded from mid- or late August to September. In the UK, the flight period is from the end of May to the beginning of July (in the south-west) and early June to early August (in the south-east).\n\nFennoscandian subspecies \"M. a. norvegica\" flies in June–July, precise timing being affected by the season.\n\nIn southern Europe, subspecies \"M. a. celadussa\" flies in a single brood at high altitude in June and July. Below the subalpine level, however, it is bivoltine, flying in May–June and late July–August—except for f. \"nevadensis\" in the Sierra Nevada, which is univoltine.\n\nIn the UK, the following species are used:\n\nAdditional host plants used elsewhere in Europe are:\n\n\nUp to eight subspecies are recognized in Europe:\n\n\nMany forms and subspecies of \"M. a. athalia\" have been described, but are best regarded as \"ecological variants\" and intermediates in clinal variation. Bulgaria has f. \"boris\" Frühstorfer, with heavier marginal borders, alongside the typical nominate form.\n\nIn central Sweden and Finland, \"M. a. norvegica\" f. \"lachares\" Frühstorfer has finer black markings; transitional forms between f. \"lachares\" and typical \"M. a. norvegica\" occur in southern Sweden.\nIn Portugal and north-west Spain, \"M. a. celadussa\" f. \"biedermanni\" Querci is larger than typical \"M. a. celadussa\", with finer black lines in the outer half of the wing, but a thicker discal line; transitional forms occur in central west Spain. In Sierra Nevada, f. \"nevadensis\" Verity is golden yellow with fine black markings (it is also univoltine, whereas typical \"M. a. celadussa\" is bivoltine at low altitude). In \"southern\" Europe, f. \"tenuicola\" Verity occurs in late broods—it is small and its black markings reduced.\n\n\n"}
