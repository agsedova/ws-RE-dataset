A wicket-keeper who played seven Tests and 11 One Day Internationals in 2001–02 and 2002–03.\n\nHe was educated at Forest School, Walthamstow and Durham University (Collingwood College), where he completed the Sport in the Community course. In 2001, and still an undergraduate, he was called up for an England winter tour.\n\nFoster, who is known by the Essex fans as Fozzy, is often regarded as the best wicket keeper in the game. In July 2011, Alec Stewart described him as the best pure wicket-keeper in the world. This is a fact that is underlined by his ability to stand up to the stumps to many quick bowlers with consistency and excellence, and for his athleticism standing back. However, he has been overlooked by England selectors as a possible result of perceived mediocre batting, with Matt Prior, Steven Davies and Jos Buttler being preferred. Foster's batting is reliant on cuts, pulls and sweeps. In all forms of cricket, Foster uses the reverse sweep effectively. Foster usually bats at seven for Essex in all forms. He once hit 5 sixes off of the first five balls of a Scott Borthwick over vs Durham in a Pro40, but missed out on the elusive sixth when Borthwick bowled a leg-side wide.\n\nIn county cricket, Foster has played for Essex since his County Championship debut in 2000 and in 2009 Season was selected as vice captain. He made his maiden first-class hundred against Worcestershire in 2001, but two broken bones ruined his 2002 season and though 2003 was a better year there was little hint of the startling summer he was to enjoy with the bat in 2004. That season he hit four more centuries, including 212 against Leicestershire as Essex made 708/9 declared. He also passed 1,000 runs for the season for the first time, averaging 51.85, and claimed 51 victims. In the 2006 season, he averaged 42.41 in the Liverpool Victoria County Championship and showed good form with the gloves and bat in one day cricket also.\n\nFoster was the recipient of the NBC Denis Compton Award in 2001.\n\nIn the winter of 2007–2008, Foster played for England Lions team for their tour to India, after being called up following an injury to Worcestershire's Steven Davies.\n\nGood form with both the gloves and the bat in recent seasons kept Foster in the selectors minds' for a possible recall to the England setup, demonstrated by his selection for the MCC season opener against Sussex in 2008. This was realised when he was picked as the only regular wicket-keeper in England's 30-man squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. Debate continued in the run up to the 2009 Ashes series whether Foster should be selected as the Test wicketkeeper for England.\n\nFoster played for England in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, receiving high praise for his sharp keeping and stumpings of Yuvraj Singh and Dwayne Bravo. However, due to the preference of selectors for wicketkeepers who can bat fluently, Matt Prior remained the first-choice for England, and these five appearances were the total of his T20I appearances.\n\nFoster was made county captain of Essex in June 2010 for all forms of the game, when Mark Pettini stepped down due to poor form with the bat. In 2011, Foster was given a beneficiary by Essex, and this included many events such as a Twenty20 match named \"Fozzy's Big Bash\". This match featured the Essex 1st XI vs an All Star XI, which included leading Test wicket-taker Muttiah Muralitharan and former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff among others. He was replaced as captain in December 2015. His continued form, particularly behind the stumps, was one of the factors that led to two promising wicket-keeper batsmen, Adam Wheater and Ben Foakes to leave the county to further develop their careers. In 2018 he shared keeping duties with Wheater who had returned from Hampshire, and then Foster retired at the end of the season after hearing that Essex would not be renewing his contract.\n\nJames Foster has been known to display a fiery temperament. This was demonstrated in a televised T20 game vs Surrey County Cricket Club in 2011 at The Oval. Foster was the recipient of a waist-high full toss from Zander de Bruyn, which Foster was caught out from. A heated argument with the umpires then followed. Foster was subsequently fined an undisclosed amount by Essex County Cricket Club and also given a two match ban by the ECB.\n\nFoster after retiring from cricket, was appointed as the T20 batting consultant for Glamorgan for 2019 t20 Blast.\nHe was appointed as the head coach of Khulna Tigers, for 2019-20 season, a franchise of Bangladesh Premier League.\nAlso he is appointed as KKR Fielding coach for IPL 2020 season. \n"}

It was released 17 February 1994 by Peaceville Records.\n\n\"Transilvanian Hunger\" was the band's first album to be recorded with just two members, Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, following the departure of Zephyrous.\n\nFenriz performed all instrumentation on the album, with Nocturno Culto adding vocals. As of 2018, this and \"Panzerfaust\" have been the only Darkthrone albums with this arrangement (although Fenriz also performs spoken word vocals on the \"Panzerfaust\" outro). The album was recorded on a 4-track recorder set up in Fenriz's bedroom (dubbed \"Necrohell studios\" by the band). Lyrics for four of the album's songs were written by the Norwegian black metal musician Varg Vikernes, who performed solo as Burzum.\n\nThe cover art was a black-and-white photograph of Fenriz with a candelabrum, which bore a likeness to the cover of Mayhem's 1993 live album \"Live in Leipzig\". The back cover stated that \"Darkthrone is for all the evil in man\" and listed the slogan \"True Norwegian Black Metal\".\n\nOriginally, the back cover also bore the words \"Norsk Arisk Black Metal\" (\"Norwegian Aryan black metal\"). Due to negative feedback from many distributors, however, the phrase was removed. The band also intended to issue another controversial statement to mark the album's release: \"We would like to state that \"Transilvanian Hunger\" stands beyond any criticism. If any man should attempt to criticize this LP, he should be thoroughly patronized for his obviously Jewish behavior\". In a press release, Peaceville Records issued both this statement and their own response, berating the sentiment but acknowledging that they could not censor their artists. Darkthrone issued a formal apology at Peaceville's behest. They said they had used \"Arisk\" to mean \"true\" or \"pure\" and that \"Jewish\" was Norwegian youth slang for \"idiotic\". Darkthrone included the following statement with their next album, \"Panzerfaust\", the following year: \"Darkthrone is certainly not a Nazi band nor a political band. Those of you who still might think so, you can lick Mother Mary's asshole in eternity\". More recently, Fenriz disowned these past statements, describing them as \"disgusting\". He admitted regret and noted that at the time, he was going through a phase of being \"angry at several races\".\n\nThe ending of the track \"As Flittermice as Satans Spys\" contained a backmasked message. When the voice is played backwards, it utters the phrase: \"In the name of God, let the churches burn\".\n\nIn 2003, the album was remastered and reissued by Peaceville, as well as being repackaged in a cardboard digipak. The fourth and final chapter of a four-part video interview (spanning the first four albums) with Fenriz and Nocturno Culto was also included as bonus material.\n\nIn 2017, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Transilvanian Hunger\" as 85th on their list of 'The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.'\n\n"}
{"id": "2054459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054459", "title": "Urgent care center", "text": "Urgent care center\n\nUrgent care is a category of walk-in clinic in the United States focused on the delivery of ambulatory care in a dedicated medical facility outside of a traditional emergency department (emergency room). Urgent care centers primarily treat injuries or illnesses requiring immediate care but not serious enough to require an emergency department (ED) visit. Urgent care centers are distinguished from similar ambulatory healthcare centers such as emergency departments and convenient care clinics by their scope of conditions treated and available facilities on-site.\n\nThe United States is seeing a rapid increase in the number of urgent care centers. In the United Kingdom, similar services are called urgent treatment centres. While urgent care centers are usually not open 24 hours a day, 70% of centers in the United States open by 8:00 a.m. or earlier and 95% close after 7:00 p.m.\n\nThe initial urgent care centers opened in the United States during the 1970s. Since then, this healthcare sector has rapidly expanded to approximately 10,000 centers across the United States. Many centers were started by emergency medicine physicians, responding to a public need for convenient access to unscheduled medical care. A significant factor for the increase of these centers is significant monetary savings when compared to EDs. Many managed care organizations (MCOs) now encourage or even require customers to utilize urgent care options. As of 2014, the urgent care industry is worth an estimated $14.5 billion.\n\nIn 2014, US communities with non-hospital-based urgent care centers (UCCs) were mainly urban, located in areas with higher income levels and higher levels of private insurance.\nKaissi et al. considered local multi-hospital systems in Florida, Maryland, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington. In 2012 50% of 117 hospital-based \"clusters\" included either UCCs, retail clinics, or both. 57% of systems in Washington operated an UCC, compared to 36% of systems in Washington, while systems in Florida had the largest share of UCCs (17.6%). Authors noted unexplained state-by-state variation in hospital system partnership with UCC and retail clinic models. \nCorwin et al. considered Medicare beneficiaries presenting to an UCC (n=1,426,354) emergency department (ED) (n=334,841) or physicians office (n=8,359,498) with upper respiratory or urinary tract infections, bronchitis, sprains or contusions, and back or arthritic pain, in 2012. Patients who presented to an ED were more likely to be female (67% of ED presentations) compared to those who presented to a UCC or physicians office (65% and 64% respectively). Patients who presented to an UCC were significantly more likely to be aged over 85 (27%, compared to 15% of physicians office presentations, and 13% of ED presentations) or Black (11%, compared to 6% of physicians office presentations, and 4% of ED presentations).\nIn 2014, 3.1% of Family Physicians in the United States worked primarily in UCCs, with a male:female ratio of workforce is 6:7, and an urban:rural ratio of 2:1. This compares to 3.6% of Family Physicians working primarily in Emergency Care, with a male:female ratio of 5:3 and urban:rural ratio approaching 1:2.\n\nBoth the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) and the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine (AAUCM) have established criteria for urgent care centers and the physicians that operate them. Each share similar qualifying criteria including:\n\nThe UCAOA program is called Urgent Care Certification and the AAUCM is called Urgent Care Center Accreditation.\n\nThe Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) holds an annual spring convention and an annual fall conference. Founded in 2004, the UCAOA does not own any urgent care centers itself, but rather provides resources, training, and leadership to the industry. Many leaders of organized urgent care anticipate the establishment of urgent care as a fully recognized specialty. This organization launched an accreditation program in 2014, and has since partnered with an insurer called Urgent Care Assurance Company.\n\nUrgent Care Management Monthly hosts a bi-annual conference, teaching doctors, investors, and owners about the business side of an urgent care center.\nUrgent Care Management Monthly (UCMM) is the official publication for urgent care management, with discussions on topics such as billing, staffing, marketing, accounting, and logistics.\n\nJUCM, The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine is the Official Publication of the Urgent Care Association (UCA). Each issue contains peer-reviewed clinical and practice management articles.\n\nBoard of Certification in Urgent Care Medicine (BCUCM) provides board certification for physicians with requisite training and experience. The Urgent Care College of Physicians (UCCOP) offers educational programs for physicians in the urgent care field, and advocates for the field's overall status as a unique specialty.\n\nAnother entity, the American Board of Urgent Care Medicine (ABUCM), was founded in 1997. This organization provides certification to urgent care programs.\n\nIn 2006, the Urgent Care Association of America sponsored the first fellowship training program in urgent care medicine. A collaboration between the Department of Family Medicine University Hospitals of Cleveland / Case School of Medicine, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA), and University Primary and Specialty Care Practices, Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio made this fellowship possible. The program was partially funded by an unrestricted grant from the Urgent Care Association of America. Fellowship physicians receive training in many disciplines, including: adult emergencies, pediatric emergencies, wound & injury evaluation and treatment, occupational medicine, urgent care procedures, and care center business aspects. In 2007, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) sponsored a second fellowship opportunity through the University of Illinois. The one-year fellowships are open to graduates of accredited Family Medicine and Med/Peds residencies.\n\nUnlike other walk-in clinics such as retail clinics, urgent care centers are generally staffed by a physician and supported by nurses, physician assistants and medical assistants. Sixty-five percent of urgent care centers have at least one physician on-site at all times.\n\nOf the physicians that staff urgent care centers, 47.8% are family medicine, 30.1% are emergency medicine and 7.6% are internal medicine.\n\nWith these licensed physician on-site, urgent care centers are able to offer a wide range of services including broken bones, moderate cuts and lacerations requiring stitches, and most common injuries and illnesses. These services, of course, are made possible with the diagnostic equipment and x-ray machines typically found at an urgent care.\n\nOf course, the urgent care centers are not an emergency department. They do not offer surgical services, as a rule- particularly invasive surgical procedures (more than cutaneous or subcutaneous procedures- those involving body organs and organ parts, and/or deep penetration of deep fascia, tendons, ligaments, bursae, joints, muscles, or bones), any procedures requiring the use of regional or general anesthesia (more than topical local anesthesia), those procedures requiring a full operating room or suite, having lengthy recovery times, or requiring more than the level of imaging or specialists available at the center.\n\nThat said, an estimated 13.7 to 27.1 percent of all emergency department visits could take place at an urgent care center or a retail clinic, generating a potential cost savings of approximately $4.4 billion annually, according to a 2010 study in \"Health Affairs\".\n\nThe majority of urgent care centers are owned by physicians or physician groups, however, more corporations and investment banks are acquiring urgent care centers and creating regional and national brands in the industry. The following is a breakdown of urgent care ownership following a 2012 study by the UCAOA:\n\nIn recent years the American Medical Association approved the code UCM (Urgent Care Medicine). This code allows physicians to self-designate as specializing in urgent care medicine. Services rendered in an urgent care center may be designated, using the place of service code -20 (POS -20) on the CMS-1500 form, as submitted to third-party payers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have designated two specific codes to apply to urgent care centers: S9083 (global fee for urgent care centers) and S9088 (services rendered in an urgent care center).\n\n"}

This white material crystallizes in cubes like rock salt. CaS has been studied as a component in a process that would recycle gypsum, a product of flue-gas desulfurization. Like many salts containing sulfide ions, CaS typically has an odour of HS, which results from small amount of this gas formed by hydrolysis of the salt.\n\nIn terms of its atomic structure, CaS crystallizes in the same motif as sodium chloride indicating that the bonding in this material is highly ionic. The high melting point is also consistent with its description as an ionic solid. In the crystal, each S ion is surrounded by an octahedron of six Ca ions, and complementarily, each Ca ion surrounded by six S ions.\n\nCaS is produced by \"carbothermic reduction\" of calcium sulfate, which entails the conversion of carbon, usually as charcoal, to carbon dioxide:\nand can react further:\n\nIn the second reaction the sulfate (+6 oxidation state) oxidizes the sulfide (-2 oxidation state) to sulfur dioxide (+4 oxidation state), while it is being reduced to sulfur dioxide itself (+4 oxidation state).\n\nCaS is also a byproduct in the Leblanc process, a once major industrial process for producing sodium carbonate. In that process sodium sulfide reacts with calcium carbonate: \nMillions of tons of this calcium sulfide byproduct was discarded, causing extensive pollution and controversy.\n\nMilk of lime, Ca(OH), reacts with elemental sulfur to give a \"lime-sulfur\", which has been used as an insecticide. The active ingredient is probably a calcium polysulfide, not CaS.\n\nCalcium sulfide decomposes upon contact with water, including moist air, giving a mixture of Ca(SH), Ca(OH), and Ca(SH)(OH).\n\nIt reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to release toxic hydrogen sulfide gas.\n\nCalcium sulfide is phosphorescent, and will glow a blood red for up to an hour after a light source is removed.\n\nOldhamite is the name for mineralogical form of CaS. It is a rare component of some meteorites and has scientific importance in solar nebula research. Burning of coal dumps can also produce the compound.\n\n"}
{"id": "2054481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054481", "title": "Balcerowicz Plan", "text": "Balcerowicz Plan\n\nThe Balcerowicz Plan (), also termed \"Shock Therapy\", was a method for rapidly transitioning from an economy based on state ownership and central planning, to a capitalist market economy. Named for its author, the Polish minister and economist Leszek Balcerowicz, the plan was adopted in Poland in 1989. There was a temporary drop in output, but growth was eventually achieved by 1992. Similar reforms were made in a number of countries. The plan has resulted in a reduced inflation and budget deficit, while simultaneously increasing unemployment and worsening the financial situation of the poorest members of society. \n\nThe unofficial talks at Magdalenka and then the Polish Round Table talks of 1989 allowed for a peaceful transition of power to the democratically elected government. Initially it was agreed that the government would be formed by Tadeusz Mazowiecki and the opposition, while the seat of the president of Poland would be given to former Polish United Workers' Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.\n\nThe state of Poland's economy as of 1989 was dire. After failed social and economic reforms of 70's the communist government secretly declared its insolvency to Western creditors already in 1981 Food price increases introduced first in 70's to preserve the basic cash flow led to social unrest and formation of mass Solidarity social change movement which, by early 80's had over 10 million members. Desperate attempts to maintain the Marxian-style economy and internal opposition in the Party to any economic reforms that would break this status quo led to introduction of martial law (1981-83) which further hindered economic growth and resulted in international sanctions. In 1982 the government imposed further large (up to 100%) price increases and significantly extended rationing of food and other basic goods.\n\nIn late 80's, after 45 years of communist rule, Poland's economy was ineffective, paralyzed by central planning and discontent of poorly paid workers. The inflation rate had reached 639.6% and was constantly rising. Foreign debt reached $42 billion. The majority of state-owned monopolies and holdings were largely ineffective and completely obsolete in terms of technology. Although there was practically no unemployment in Poland, wages were low and the shortage economy led to lack of even the most basic foodstuffs in the shops.\n\nAfter the failure of the Communist government in the elections of 4 June 1989, it became clear that the previous regime was no longer legitimate.\n\nIn September 1989 a commission of experts was formed under the presidency of Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's leading economist, Minister of Finance and deputy Premier of Poland. Among the members of the commission were Jeffrey Sachs, Stanisław Gomułka, Stefan Kawalec and Wojciech Misiąg. The commission prepared a plan of extensive reforms that were to enable fast transformation of Poland's economy from obsolete and ineffective central planning to capitalism, as adopted by the states of Western Europe and America. \n\nOn 6 October the program was presented on public television and in December the Sejm passed a packet of 10 acts, all of which were signed by the president on 31 December 1989. These were:\n\n\nIn late December the plan was approved by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF's support was especially important because the national debt in various foreign banks and governments reached an amount of US$42.3 billion (64,8% of GDP) in 1989. The IMF granted Poland with a stabilization fund of US$1 billion and an additional stand-by credit of US$720 million. Following this the World Bank granted Poland additional credits for modernization of exports of Polish goods and food products. Many governments followed and paid off some of the former Communist debt (about 50% of the sum of debt capital and all cumulated interest rates to 2001).\n\nThe most visible change in 1989 was the end of food and basic goods shortages thanks to depenalization of private trade, which was a criminal offense (\"speculation\") before 1989. Formally the law was enacted on 1 December 1989 but since enforcement was stopped by summer 1989, shops were literally flooded by goods produced and imported by small private enterprises. The Christmas of 1989, which is in Poland celebrated with a lot of traditional dishes, was the first one when people could buy goods without queues, corruption or black market. Previously scarce goods, especially food, toys and electronics, were now widely available from private suppliers, although at significantly higher prices. \n\nIn the larger picture, the reforms drastically limited the state's influence over the economy. The plan released price-fixing for many products, allowing them to be decided by the market instead of the Central Statistical Office. Also, the internal debt was drastically limited by 3% of GNP by reducing state subsidies to coal, electricity and petroleum. Although inflation seemed to be out of control, the Polish economy gradually started to get back on track. By 1992, more than 600,000 private companies had been set up, providing jobs for approximately 1.5 million people. \n\nPoland's annual growth rate between 1989 and 2000 was the highest of all post-communist economies. Economists in Ukraine frequently use the Balcerowicz Plan as a comparison of how economy could grow in Ukraine if similar reforms had been implemented in 1990 or, from another point of view, how it could have stagnated in Poland if the plan were not implemented. It terms of GDP per capita corrected by purchasing power parity, both countries started from the same level in 1990, but Ukraine's economy was developing much slower in subsequent years.\n\nMany aspects of the post-communist economy were shock to the society, for example sharp rise of prices on food that was previously officially sold at small, regulated prices even though it was in fact rarely seen in shops. Many state-owned enterprises and collective farms were already insolvent in 80's and didn't pay their workers for months or years (which was the cause for unrest) but from legal point of view they weren't bankrupt, since the concept of bankruptsy of a state-owned enterprise did not even exist in the communist legislation for ideological reasons, just as didn't unemployment. \n\nBalcerowicz reforms reintroduced these concepts to the Polish law to allow for restructurization and privatization, which resulted in a widespread perception that it was these reforms that were the direct cause for bankruptcy and unemployment. The rise of formal unemployment was especially drastic in rural areas of the country, which had previously been collectivized by the government into state-owned farms. \n\nA number of left-wing and populist leaders criticized the reforms - most notably, Andrzej Lepper, the leader of the populist Self-Defense \"(Samoobrona)\" party, used the slogan \"Balcerowicz must go\" (\"Balcerowicz musi odejść\"). \n\n\"Dynamics of GDP (according to PPP in USD) in selected countries - \"GGDC\"\"\n\"Inflation at the end of year in selected countries\"\n\"Dynamics of employees number in selected countries - \"GGDC\"\"\n\"Unemployment rate in selected countries\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2054484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054484", "title": "Ken Holtzman", "text": "Ken Holtzman\n\nKenneth Dale Holtzman (born November 3, 1945) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played as a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from through , most notably as a member of the Chicago Cubs for whom he pitched two no-hitters and, with the Oakland Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive World Series championships between 1972 to 1974. A two-time All-Star, Holtzman was a 20-game-winner for the Athletics in 1973. He also played for the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees. \nHoltzman was the only pitcher in the live-ball era to throw two no-hitters for the Cubs, until that feat was equaled by Jake Arrieta. In 2007, Holtzman managed the Petach Tikva Pioneers in the Israel Baseball League.\n\nHoltzman was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He graduated from University City High School in St. Louis in 1963.\n\nHoltzman is Jewish, and through 2010, his 174 career victories were the most in the major leagues by a Jewish pitcher (ahead of Sandy Koufax). He tied Koufax' record for the most wins by a Jewish pitcher in 1977, and passed him in 1978. Holtzman's 1,601 strikeouts were second (behind Koufax), and his 451 games were second (behind Scott Schoeneweis). He held the record for most pitching appearances by a Jewish pitcher until 1998, when Scott Radinsky passed him to become the major league leader in appearances among Jewish pitchers. His 3.49 ERA was fifth (behind Koufax, Radinsky, Barney Pelty, and Erskine Mayer).\n\nHoltzman obtained his B.A. in business administration and French from the University of Illinois, and was selected by the Cubs in the fourth round of the 1965 amateur draft. \n\nAt age 19, Holtzman pitched only 12 games in the minor leagues in 1965, four with the Treasure Valley Cubs in the Pioneer League, and eight with the Wenatchee Chiefs in the Northwest League. He was 8–3 in the dozen starts, with a 1.99 earned run average and 114 strikeouts in 86 innings. He was called up to the major leagues in September and pitched four innings over three games in relief.\n\nAfter three relief appearances in September 1965, Holtzman joined the Cubs' starting rotation in 1966, and had an 11–16 rookie campaign as the team finished in last place. The team's fortunes turned around, however, as they had winning years in every season from 1967 through 1971.\n\nAs a promising Jewish left-hander, he was heralded as \"the new Sandy Koufax.\" He pitched against Koufax in 1966 on September 25, and took the win by a 2–1 score. Koufax made his last regular-season appearance a week later, on October 2.\n\nHoltzman served in the National Guard in 1967 and was only available to play on weekends. He appeared in 12 games and had a 9–0 record. Through 2006, only four pitchers in baseball history were undefeated with more decisions. With his military obligations behind him, he became a strong second starter behind Ferguson Jenkins, and the Cubs began being successful in the National League for the first time since World War II.\n\nAfter going 11–14 in 1968, he posted consecutive 17-win seasons. Holtzman was named NL Player of the Month in May 1969 with a 6-0 record, a 2.16 ERA, and 44 strikeouts.\n\nThat August 19, he pitched his first no-hitter at Wrigley Field against the eventual Western Division champion Atlanta Braves, winning 3–0 on Ron Santo's three-run home run and outdueling the Braves' Phil Niekro. Holtzman had no strikeouts and three walks in the game. This was the first no-hitter by a Cub left-hander at Wrigley Field and the second no-hitter ever thrown without a strikeout (Sad Sam Jones on September 4, 1923), a feat that has not been equaled since. In the seventh inning, Hank Aaron crushed a drive to left field that appeared to be a home run, but the wind held up the ball, enabling Billy Williams to catch the long fly ball in the recessed \"well\" at the wall in left field. Holtzman faced Aaron again in the ninth, and got him to ground out to second base to complete the no-hitter. The Cubs led the Eastern Division for much of the season before finishing in second place, eight games behind the eventual world champion New York Mets.\n\nIn 1970, Holtzman had his best year with the Cubs, with a 17–11 record and a 3.38 ERA, and finished third in the NL in starts (38), fifth in both strikeouts (202) and innings pitched (287⅔), sixth in complete games (15) and ninth in wins.\n\nOn June 3, 1971, Holtzman pitched a no-hitter — the first ever at Riverfront Stadium — against the defending league champion Cincinnati Reds, winning the game 1–0 during what would prove to be his final year with the Cubs. In doing so, he became the first Cubs pitcher since Larry Corcoran (who had three from 1880 to 1884) to have two no-hitters for the team.\n\nHoltzman asked to be traded at the end of the 1971 season, so he was dealt to the Oakland Athletics in November in exchange for outfielder Rick Monday. Oakland had won the Western division in 1971 but were swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series. This was just as Oakland began its run of three straight World Series titles.\n\nJoining a staff that featured Vida Blue and Catfish Hunter, he won 19 games in 1972 (7th in the AL) and was named to the All-Star team for the first time. He lost Game 3 of the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers as opposing pitcher Joe Coleman set an ALCS record with 14 strikeouts. After Oakland won the ALCS in five games, Holtzman won Game 1 of the World Series against the Reds. He started Game 4, but left in the eighth inning with a 1–0 lead and a runner on third base. The Reds scored twice to take the lead, but Oakland scored twice in the ninth inning to win 3–2. He relieved Hunter in the eighth inning of Game 7 with a 3–1 lead but after surrendering a double to Joe Morgan, he was replaced by Rollie Fingers. The A's hung on for a 3–2 win, taking their first Series title since 1930 (when the team was located in Philadelphia).\n\nIn 1973, Holtzman led the A's with a 2.97 ERA (6th best in the league) as each of their three top starters won 20 or more games. He was again an All-Star, going 21–13 in 40 starts (his 21 wins 4th-best in the AL) with 157 strikeouts. Over the next 33 years only two other left-handers had as many starts in a season. In the 1973 ALCS against the Baltimore Orioles, he won an 11-inning 2–1 duel against Mike Cuellar in Game 3 when Bert Campaneris homered to lead off the last inning. He started three times in the 1973 World Series against the Mets, winning Game 1 2–1. He lasted only ⅓ of an inning in Game 4, departing after a 3-run homer by Rusty Staub, which was followed by two more base runners. He recovered to win Game 7, leaving in the 6th inning with a 5–1 lead as the A's won the game 5–2 and their second straight title. In both his victories, he doubled and also scored the first run for the A's after not having batted all season due to the American League using the designated hitter for the first time in the 1973 season.\n\nDespite posting better or equal numbers with Catfish Hunter in 1973, Holtzman was not among the ten AL pitchers that year to receive votes in Cy Young Award considerations, while Hunter finished third. Holtzman would never earn so much as a single Cy Young or MVP vote in his entire career.\n\nHe again won 19 games in 1974, but this time endured 17 losses despite his 3.07 ERA, which ranked 11th in the League. Facing the Orioles in the 1974 ALCS, he pitched a 5–0 shutout in Game 2, taking a one-hitter into the eighth inning and allowing only five singles. Against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, he started Game 1 but was pulled in the fifth inning with a 2–1 lead; the A's went on to win 3–2. He won Game 4 5–2, hitting a home run off Andy Messersmith in the third inning for a 1–0 lead (the designated hitter was not used in World Series play until 1976). He would be the last pitcher to hit a World Series home run until Joe Blanton in 2008. During the nine seasons in which he batted regularly during the season, he had only two home runs. Oakland won Game 5 and became the first team to win three straight World Series since the New York Yankees won five straight from 1949 to 1953.\n\nAfter losing in salary arbitration in February, Holtzman had an 18–14 record for the 1975 A's as they won their fifth straight American League Western Division title. On June 8, against the Detroit Tigers, he had what would have been his third career no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth by a Tom Veryzer double. He would have become the third pitcher (after Cy Young and Jim Bunning) to pitch no-hitters in both leagues. Holtzman lost Games 1 and 3 of the ALCS to the Boston Red Sox as the A's were swept. He was fourth in the AL in games started (38), sixth in hits allowed per 9 innings pitched (7.33), and seventh in wins.\n\nPaid $93,000 in 1975 and one of nine Oakland players refusing to sign 1976 contracts, Holtzman sought a three-year $460,000 pact. With free agency imminent after the season and the expectations of higher salaries for which Athletics owner Finley was unwilling to pay, he was traded along with Reggie Jackson and minor-league right-handed pitcher Bill Van Bommel to the Orioles for Don Baylor, Mike Torrez, and Paul Mitchell on April 2, 1976. Eleven weeks later in mid-June, he was traded by the Orioles with Doyle Alexander, Jimmy Freeman, Ellie Hendricks, and Grant Jackson to the New York Yankees for Rudy May, Tippy Martinez, Dave Pagan, Scott McGregor, and Rick Dempsey.\n\nHoltzman posted a 12–10 record for the Yankees over three years, but his playing time was increasingly limited. He did not appear in the 1976 or 1977 postseasons with New York. In June 1978, after making 5 appearances, he was traded by the Yankees to the Chicago Cubs for Ron Davis. He ended his career with Chicago in 1979, going 6–9 with a 4.59 ERA.\n\nOver 15 years, he had a 174–150 record with a 3.49 ERA, 1,601 strikeouts, and 31 shutouts in 451 games and 2,867⅓ innings. He held batters to a .220 batting average with 2 outs and runners in scoring position. His 80 victories with Chicago were the fourth most by a left-hander, behind Hippo Vaughn (151), Larry French (95), and Dick Ellsworth (84). He received four votes in Baseball Hall of Fame voting in 1985, and 5 in 1986.\n\nHoltzman went on to attempt a career as an insurance salesman. He also worked for the St. Louis Jewish Community Center, running the gymnasium in the Marilyn Fox Building. He coached the St. Louis baseball team for the Maccabi games for a few years and is a member of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nHoltzman managed the Petach Tikva Pioneers in the inaugural 2007 season of the Israel Baseball League, but was fired before the season ended. The Pioneers finished the 2007 regular season in last place (9–32; .220) and lost to the Modi'in Miracle in the quarterfinals of the 2007 championship.\n\n\n This chapter in Ruttman's history, based on a June 21, 2007 interview with Holtzman conducted for the book, discusses Holtzman's American, Jewish, baseball, and life experiences from youth to the present.\n\n"}

He was born in Mont-de-Marsan, Landes, France. van de Velde turned professional in 1987 and his rookie season on the European Tour was 1989. His first European Tour win was the 1993 Roma Masters. He has twice finished in the top twenty of the Order of Merit. He came close to winning The Open Championship in 1999, but lost a three shot lead on the final hole. He played on the PGA Tour in 2000 and 2001.\n\nVan de Velde nearly achieved an upset victory at the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie, when he was the clear leader playing the closing holes. He arrived at the 18th tee needing only a double bogey six to become the first Frenchman since 1907 to win a major tournament. He had played error-free golf for much of the week and birdied the 18th hole in two previous rounds.\n\nVan de Velde chose to use his driver off the tee, and he drove the ball to the right of the burn, where he was lucky to find land. Rather than laying up and hitting the green with his third, Van de Velde decided to go for the green with his second shot. His shot drifted right, ricocheted backwards off the railings of the grandstands by the side of the green, landed on top of the stone wall of the Barry Burn and then bounced fifty yards backwards into knee-deep rough.\n\nOn his third shot, Van de Velde's club got tangled in the rough on his downswing, and his ball flew into the Barry Burn, a water hazard. He removed his shoes and socks and stepped through shin-deep water as he debated whether to try to hit his ball out of the Barry Burn, which guards the 18th green. Ultimately, he took a drop and then hit his fifth shot into the greenside bunker. Van de Velde shot to within six feet from the hole, and made the putt for a triple-bogey seven, dropping him into a three-way playoff with Justin Leonard and Paul Lawrie. Lawrie won in the playoff.\n\nIn the new millennium, Van de Velde was troubled by injuries for several years, but he made a comeback at the 2005 Open de France, where he lost a playoff to fellow Frenchman Jean-François Remésy after, once again, finding water on the last hole.

{"id": "2054492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054492", "title": "Forrest Claypool", "text": "Forrest Claypool\n\nForrest Edward Claypool is an American politician who has held several positions in the governments of Chicago, Cook County, and the State of Illinois. He was the Chief Executive Officer of Chicago Public Schools from July 27, 2015, until December 8, 2017. Previous offices held by Claypool include Superintendent of the Chicago Park District from 1993 to 1998, Chief of Staff to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and President of the Chicago Transit Authority. In 2007–2008, Claypool served as a key member of Barack Obama campaign's media team, in his capacity as a longtime partner of David Axelrod.\n\nAn attorney, he lives in the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago. Claypool is twice married and has three children.\n\nBorn in Vandalia, Illinois in 1958, Claypool grew up in downstate in the nearby town of St. Elmo, Illinois. Claypool received his bachelor's degree from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, and in 1981, graduated with a law degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was editor of the school's law review. After school, Claypool worked as an attorney and served in several non-elected positions in state and county government, including deputy commissioner of the Cook County Board of Appeals and as Deputy State Treasurer.\n\nIn 1984, he helped his friend David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant, found the firm Axelrod and Associates (now AKPD Message & Media). Claypool served as the firm's managing partner until 1989 when he left to serve in the administration of Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nIn 1989, Claypool began working for Mayor Daley, serving for two years as his first Chief of Staff. In 1993, Daley asked Claypool to take on the task of overhauling the Chicago Park District after allegations of the hired truck scandal that made public while he was the mayor's chief of staff.\n\nWhen Claypool became the CEO and Superintendent of the CPD, the District had a budget of $300 million as well as a payroll of 4,100 full-time employees and roughly an equal number of seasonal employees. Despite this extraordinarily large payroll, many basic services were not being performed. Under Claypool's tenure and Daley's command, many of the politically appointed positions were eliminated and many employees were forced to reapply for their jobs. By 1996, the payroll had fallen to 3,000 full-time employees while services improved according to many groups that studied the parks.\n\nWhen Claypool took over the District in 1993 it was also in financial disorder. For example, the District had outlays of $65 million for capital improvements but it had only $15 million in cash; it had also reached the maximum on its debt ceiling. Using the money saved from staff attrition and layoff, as well as from canceling projects he felt were wasteful, Claypool began to downsize and privatize some of the park district's services instead of performing them in-house.\n\n\"In 1993, Kemper Golf Management, Chicago, took over the operation of the district's six golf courses and two driving ranges. The contract guarantees the park district about $250,000 a year up front for capital improvements, and the remaining revenues are divided equally. In 1992, the district suffered a $530,000 operating deficit; in 1994, that was turned into a $550,000 profit.\" (Kelly 1995, American City and County) The CPD also began experimenting with the partial privatization of Soldier Field and its parking lots. In 1994, Soldier Field turned a profit for the first time in its history. Due to the success of the partial privatization, the Soldier Field Joint Venture started managing the stadium in late 1994.\n\nClaypool left the CPD in 1996 to serve a second term as Chief of Staff to Daley. In 1998, he managed the mayor's successful reelection campaign, one in which he received over 75% of the vote and won majorities of the white, black, Hispanic, and Asian votes.\n\nCasting himself as a \"reformer\", Claypool made a run for the Cook County Board in 2002. Waging a fierce campaign in which he attacked what he saw as patronage and a bloated bureaucracy in the county government, Claypool went on to upset incumbent Commissioner Ted Lechowicz 51–49% in the March 19 Democratic primary. (Lechowicz was a strong supporter of Cook County Board President John Stroger Jr.) Because Claypool's district (the 12th) is overwhelmingly Democratic, he faced only nominal opposition in the general election.\n\nClaypool quickly allied himself with fellow freshmen Commissioners Larry Suffredin (D) and Tony Peraica (R). The three were joined by sophomore Commissioner Mike Quigley (D). When, in December 2003, the four reformers garnered enough swing votes to defeat Stroger's FY 2004 budget (the first time such a thing had happened to a Cook County Board President in three decades), Stroger gave Claypool a backhanded compliment, saying, \"The media has prevailed, along with Mr. Claypool.\" This quote ran under the banner headline, \"Hell Freezes Over: Cook County Board rejects Stroger's budget\" in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". The following year (FY 2005), the County Board rejected Stroger's tax increases again. \n\nClaypool declared in December that he would run for the Democratic nomination for County Board President in 2006. John Stroger, who was a Democrat, announced earlier that he would seek a fourth term, setting up a race among Claypool, Stroger, and Quigley for the Democratic nomination. Quigley dropped out in mid-December, saying \"I am throwing my full effort and support to help elect Forrest Claypool as the next County Board President.\"\n\nClaypool raised more campaign funds than every other candidate in 2005, ending the first half of the year with over $900,000. Most pundits agreed that the Democratic primary was the real election, as Cook County is one of the most Democratic counties in the entire nation. Claypool won the support of many newspapers, including the \"Chicago Tribune\", the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", \"Crain's Chicago Business\", the \"Daily Herald\", the \"Daily Southtown\", and others. In addition, he was endorsed by Rep. Rahm Emanuel and Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn.\n\nDespite the endorsements, and the fact that Stroger suffered a stroke a week before, Claypool still lost to Stroger in the primary. The Cook County Democratic Party appointed Stroger's son Todd Stroger as the nominee to run against Tony Peraica in the general election. Todd Stroger won the election. Claypool refused to endorse Stroger and was chastised heavily by Democratic politicians and stalwarts including Mayor Daley.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 6, 2010, Forrest Claypool announced he would enter the Cook County Assessor election as an independent candidate. He officially qualified to be entered onto the general election ballot on June 28, after collecting more than three times the number of voter signatures required for independent candidates seeking office in Illinois. Claypool ran against Democrat Joseph Berrios, Green Robert Grota and Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. He was the first independent candidate to run in the history of the Cook County Assessor's office. Berrios won the race with 47.9 percent of the vote, against 31.8 percent for Claypool, 17.7 percent for Strobeck-Eckersall, and 2.6 percent for Grota.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 19, 2011, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel—a longtime political ally of Claypool—appointed him president of the Chicago Transit Authority Claypool was named Chief of Staff to mayor Rahm Emanuel in April 2015. Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced on July 16, 2015, that Claypool would assume the role of Chief Executive Officer of Chicago Public Schools on July 27, 2015. Claypool resigned as CEO on December 8, 2017, after the school district's inspector general accused him of engineering a \"full-blown cover-up\" during an ethics investigation concerning the school system's chief attorney.\n"}
{"id": "2054502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054502", "title": "Odic force", "text": "Odic force\n\nThe Odic force (also called Od [õd], Odyle, Önd, Odes, Odylic, Odyllic, or Odems) is the name given in the mid-19th century to a hypothetical vital energy or life force by Baron Carl von Reichenbach. Von Reichenbach coined the name from that of the Norse god Odin in 1845. The study of Odic force is called \"odology\".\n\nAs von Reichenbach was investigating the manner in which the human nervous system could be affected by various substances, he conceived the existence of a new force allied to electricity, magnetism, and heat, a force which he thought was radiated by most substances, and to the influence of which different persons are variously sensitive. He named this vitalist concept \"Odic force\". Proponents say that Odic force permeates all plants, animals, and humans.\n\nBelievers in Odic force said that it is visible in total darkness as colored auras surrounding living things, crystals, and magnets, but that viewing it requires hours first spent in total darkness, and only very sensitive people have the ability to see it. They also said that it resembles the Asian concepts prana and qi. However, they regarded the \"Odic force\" as not associated with breath (like India's prana and the qi of Chinese martial arts) but rather mainly with biological electromagnetic fields.\n\nVon Reichenbach did not tie Odic force into other vitalist theories. Baron von Reichenbach expounded the concept of Odic force in detail in a book-length article, \"Researches on Magnetism\", \"Electricity\", \"Heat and Light in their Relations to Vital Forces\", which appeared in a special issue of a respected scientific journal, \"Annalen der Chemie und Physik\". He said that (1) the Odic force had a positive and negative flux, and a light and dark side; (2) individuals could forcefully \"emanate\" it, particularly from the hands, mouth, and forehead; and (3) the Odic force had many possible applications.\n\nThe Odic force was conjectured to explain the phenomenon of hypnotism. In Britain, impetus was given to this view of the subject following the translation of Reichenbach's \"Researches\" by Dr. Gregory, professor of chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. These later researches tried to show many of the Odic phenomena to be of the same nature as those described previously by Franz Mesmer and even long before Mesmer by Swedenborg.\n\nThe French parapsychologists Hippolyte Baraduc and Albert de Rochas were influenced by the concept of the Odic force.\n\nVon Reichenbach hoped to develop scientific proof for a universal life force; however, his experiments relied on perceptions reported by individuals who claimed to be \"sensitive\", as he himself could not observe any of the reported phenomena. The \"sensitives\" had to work in total or near-total darkness to be able to observe the phenomena. Reichenbach stated that, through experimentation, possibly 1/3 of the population could view the phenomenon, but far less otherwise.\n\nThe concept of Odic force was criticized by the scientific community as there was no reliable or replicable data for its existence. In the 19th century it was described as quackery by critics and is regarded today as an example of pseudoscience.\n\nScience writer Martin Gardner in his book \"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\" (1957) noted that \"scientists were unable to duplicate the baron's experiments.\"\n\nRobert Todd Carroll in \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" has written:\n\nThe baron had no training in psychology or psychopathology and no training in devising experiments involving people. He applied many standard scientific techniques and followed standard practices of data collection and recording, including graphs and charts. But he seems to have had no sense of how to do a controlled experiment with so-called \"sensitives,\" people who might better be described as neurotics or delusional. (Jastrow says that for the most part, his subjects were \"neurotic young women.\") Given the fact that he deceived himself so thoroughly over such a long period of time, it seems reasonable to assume that he was (at the very least) unconsciously suggesting behaviors to his subjects. His enthusiasm for the project undoubtedly biased his subjective observations. That he came to think that the odic force could explain dozens of disparate phenomena, while being unable to convince other scientists that he had discovered anything, signifies the pathological nature of his investigations. Reichenbach's pursuit of the odic force is a classic example of pathological science.\n\nScientists have abandoned concepts such as the Odic force. In western popular culture the name is used in a similar way to qi or prana to refer to spiritual energies or the vital force associated with living things. In Europe, the Odic force has been mentioned in books on dowsing, for example.\n\n"}

Usually a leadoff hitter, he batted .301 lifetime, scored 100 runs seven times and led the NL in hits and stolen bases twice each. His 1092 walks ranked fourth in NL history when he retired, and remain a franchise record; he also hit .348 over four World Series. His .394 career on-base percentage was the highest by a 20th-century third baseman until Wade Boggs exceeded it in the late 1980s, and was the top NL mark until 2001. Hack led the NL in putouts five times, in double plays three times and in assists and fielding percentage twice each. At the end of his career he ranked second in major league history to Pie Traynor in games (1836) at third base, second in NL history to Traynor in putouts (1944), assists (3494) and total chances (5684), and third in NL history in double plays (255).\n\nHack, who batted left-handed and threw right-handed, was born in Sacramento, California and played baseball at Sacramento High School.

In the 1932 World Series against the New York Yankees, his sole appearance was as a pinch runner for Gabby Hartnett in the eighth inning of the final 13–6 Game 4 loss. In his first full year in 1934, he batted a respectable .289 and tied for fifth in the league with 11 steals. In he began to assume Traynor's mantle as the league's top third baseman, batting .311 and finishing third in the NL in on-base percentage and tied for fourth in steals.\n\nHe quickly became one of the sport's most popular players, and 21-year-old team employee Bill Veeck (William's son) staged a 1935 promotion in which fans were given mirrors labeled \"Smile with Stan\", with Hack's face on the reverse side; but the fans used the mirrors to reflect sunlight into the eyes of opposing batters, and the umpires threatened to forfeit the game if they didn't stop. The NL office quickly banned any similar promotions in the future. Batting an unusually low seventh in the 1935 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, he hit only .227 as the Cubs lost in six games. In Game 3 he singled, stole second base and scored to give Chicago a 2–0 lead in the second inning, and singled and scored again in the ninth as the Cubs tied the game at 5, though they lost 6–5 in 11 innings. In Game 6 at Navin Field, he doubled with two out in the sixth inning, and tripled to lead off the ninth with the score tied at 3, but the Cubs were unable to drive him in. Manager Charlie Grimm opted to let starting pitcher Larry French bat with one out, and French hit a ground ball to the pitcher, Tommy Bridges, with Augie Galan flying to left to end the inning; the Tigers won the Series in the bottom of the inning when Mickey Cochrane scored on Goose Goslin's single.\n\nIn 1936 Hack batted .298, and tied for second in the NL with 17 steals – the first of five straight years in which he finished first or second. He also scored 100 runs for the first time, and had a career-high 78 runs batted in. He led the league in putouts (151), assists (247) and double plays (25) in , and was second in runs (106) and steals (16) and third in walks (83) while hitting .297. marked his best season to date as he hit .320 (sixth in the league), led the NL in steals (16), was second in hits (195) and runs (109), fourth in walks (94) and fifth in on-base percentage (.411). He had 67 RBI as the team featured a remarkably well balanced offense, with seven of the eight regulars having between 56 and 67 RBI. He was among the league's top ten players in doubles, triples (a career-best 11) and total bases, led the NL in putouts (178) and double plays (26), and made his first of five All-Star teams as the Cubs won the pennant by two games; Hack finished seventh in the MVP voting. In the World Series against the Yankees, he was one of the Cubs' scarce heroes, batting .471 although they were swept in four games. In Game 1, he had three singles and drove in Chicago's only run in a 3–1 loss. He singled and scored in the first inning of Game 2, and did so again to tie the score at 2 in the third inning, though they went on to lose 6–3. He doubled and scored in the fifth inning of Game 3 for a 1–0 lead, but they lost 5–2; he had two more hits in the 8–3 Game 4 loss.\n\nIn he batted .298 and tied for the NL lead in steals with 17, also finishing second in runs (112) and pacing the league in putouts (177). He had another outstanding campaign in , topping the league in putouts (175), assists (302) and double plays (27), finishing fourth with a .317 batting average, and tying for the NL lead in hits (191). He was one behind the league leader with 21 steals, and was fourth in doubles (38, a personal best), fifth in runs (101), and sixth in on-base percentage (.395) and total bases (265). Although he did not make the All-Star team, he finished eighth in the MVP balloting. On May 17 of that year, he suffered a concussion after being hit in the head by a foul ball while standing on third base as a baserunner. saw him duplicate the previous year's accomplishments by again finishing fourth in the NL with a .317 batting mark and leading the league in hits; he was second in the league with a .417 on-base percentage and 111 runs, fourth in walks and fifth in doubles. And in he was third in hits and doubles, fourth in runs and walks, and fifth in on-base percentage, while again batting .300 and leading the NL in fielding average for the first time with a .965 mark.\n\n1943 saw a slight drop-off in his performance, though he was still among the league leaders in walks and on-base percentage, with a .289 batting average, and was again an All-Star; but a strained relationship with manager Jimmie Wilson led Hack to retire at season's end. He was persuaded to return in mid-1944 after Grimm returned to lead the team, and batted .282 in 98 games – his lowest mark in over ten years – with similarly lowered averages in slugging and OBP. But marked a full comeback as he enjoyed one of his best years, leading the NL again in putouts (195) and fielding average (.975), and setting a record with 54 consecutive error-less games. He hit a career-high .323 (fourth in the league), and finished third in OBP (.420), hits (193) and walks (99) and fifth in runs (110). The Cubs won the pennant by three games, and Hack finished eleventh in the MVP vote, won by teammate Phil Cavarretta. In the World Series against the Tigers, he hit .367, though memories of Game 6 of the 1935 Series lingered. In Game 1 at Detroit, he was observed staring out toward third base; when asked what he was looking at, he replied, \"I was just looking to see if I was still standing there.\" He reached base four times in a 4–1 loss in Game 2, and had two hits in the 3–0 Game 3 win. Game 6 at Wrigley Field was a thrilling affair; after a walk and a single in his first two turns at the plate, he singled with the bases loaded in the fifth inning to give the Cubs a 2–1 lead, and went on to score himself. After another walk and single, he came to bat in the 12th inning with the score tied at 7, two out and pinch runner Bill Schuster on first base; Hack doubled to left field off Tiger pitcher Dizzy Trout, with the ball taking a sharp bounce over outfielder Hank Greenberg's shoulder, giving the Cubs an 8–7 win and tying the Series. At the time, it was the first time in Cubs history any player recorded 4 hits in a World Series game; a feat that was matched 71 years later by Kris Bryant in Game 6 of the 2016 World Series. It was all for naught, however, as Chicago lost 9–3 in Game 7. They would not return to the Fall Classic until 2016.\n\nIn 1946, he hit .285 in only 92 games, though he was still fifth in the league with 83 walks. He ended his career in with a .271 average in 76 games. In a 16-season career, Hack had 57 home runs and 642 RBI; his totals of 1,938 games, 7,278 at-bats and 2,193 hits ranked second in Cubs history to 19th-century first baseman Cap Anson, and his totals in hits, doubles (363) and total bases (2,889) placed him behind only Traynor among NL third basemen. His 1,239 runs were the third most by a third baseman, behind only Arlie Latham (1,478) and Lave Cross (1,333); his 165 stolen bases were the fourth most by any National Leaguer between 1920 and 1950, trailing only Frankie Frisch, Max Carey and Kiki Cuyler. He was only 27 games behind Traynor's league record for games at third base, and was behind only Traynor and Heinie Groh in career double plays in the NL. His total of 1,092 walks – then the most by any third baseman – placed him behind only Mel Ott (1,708), Jimmy Sheckard (1,134) and Billy Hamilton (1,096) in NL history. In , Chipper Jones moved ahead of his career on-base percentage among NL third basemen.\n\nHack became a minor league manager, leading Des Moines in 1948–49, Springfield in 1950 and the Los Angeles Angels from 1951 to 1953, and then took over as Cubs manager in spring training of 1954, replacing Cavarretta. They had losing campaigns during each of his three seasons running the team. He became a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1957–58, managing them for the last ten games in 1958, and then returned to managing in the minor leagues in Denver (1959), Salt Lake City (1965) and Dallas-Fort Worth (1966).\n\nHe later became a restaurant manager, with his second wife Gwen, and died at age 70 in Dixon, Illinois. His first wife Dorothy Weisel Hack was a prominent amateur tennis player. He is buried in Grand Detour Cemetery in Grand Detour, Illinois. Stan had two sons with Gwen: Stanford Hack and David Hack. David had two sons with his first wife, Diane: Michael and Robert Hack, then a son and daughter with his second wife, Deb: Steven and Rebecca.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The series has a humorous take on the game of golf which includes cartoon-like characters and with modes such as miniature golf paired with a realistic engine and precise ball physics.\n\nSeven main games in the series have been published between 1997 and 2017 for every home console in PlayStation brand, with another four spin-off editions (which include a similarly-themed tennis game and various portable console versions) for PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita platforms. The most recent title in the series is \"Everybody's Golf\", released in August 2017. As of March 2017, the series has sold more than 14 million copies worldwide.\n\nThere are a variety of modes including Tournament, Training, Stroke Play, Match Play, and a Miniature Golf course. The game featured several characters; those not available from the start had to be unlocked for play by defeating them. A player could earn experience points for his character for winning tournaments and hitting a variety of shots. These points were used to open new courses. The game featured six different courses and a free moving game camera.\n\nWhile the game is very similar to the original, it does bring slight improvements. Like the game's 1997 release, there are several characters to choose from, and many more to be unlocked throughout the game. Each character has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, making character selection more than just choosing a skin. The character models themselves are more realistic looking as opposed to the big-headed anime style of the original.\n\nAgain, there are several different modes of play, from standards like Stroke, Match, and Tournament play, to the versus, through which new characters can be unlocked. Gameplay itself is a version of the standard '3 click' variety used by the majority of golf games.\n\nThis is the first game in the series to include guest characters from other games. They are Sweet Tooth from \"Twisted Metal\", Sir Daniel Fortesque from \"MediEvil\", and Gex from the \"Gex\" video game series. They only appeared in the American and European versions.\n\nThe overall look and feel of the game is pretty much the same as its predecessors, though refined visuals are a given. The same '3 click' system for hitting the ball is back. There are a number of different courses, characters, clubs, and ball types to choose from. New equipment can be purchased with experience points, which your characters earn by winning matches. Better equipment will ease up the game's difficulty a bit by providing greater accuracy, distance, and control. As an additional feature, the game has an international ranking system: With a password from the game you can post your scores on a website, where you can see how you measure up against everyone else out there. It sold over one million copies worldwide.\n\nJohn Daly is an unlockable golfer in this game, which makes him the first real life golfer to ever appear in the series. He only appeared in the American release.\n\nThe new version contains more realistic physics and better graphics. In addition, the game introduced online play with the Network Adaptor. The developers also increased the overall number of characters from 15 to 24, added more caddies (10 in all) and boosted the number of courses from 6 to 15. Of these, 10 are new, while five are returning favorites from the previous game. The game also features an online Tournament mode where up to 32 players can compete against each other. the North American and European versions included online play while Japanese did not. This game has a few guest characters from other games. Jak, from the \"Jak and Daxter\" series, is a playable character, while Daxter is a caddy. Ratchet is also playable, while Clank is a caddy. The game was titled \"Hot Shots Golf Fore!\" in North America.\n\nThe game features three modes. The single-player game offers gamers the chance to unlock characters and items by competing in tournaments or by stroke play. Training mode lets golfers practice their skills on various courses with no pressure. The wireless multiplayer mode allows up to eight players to play a course together in various head-to-head matches, real-time tournaments, or the new putting challenge.\n\nThe 10 new characters can be customized with more than 250 items of clothing, accessories, clubs, and balls for a unique style. Once players gain enough to go even further under par. The game was renamed \"Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee\" in North America.\n\nThe game has 14 characters, 5 umpires, and 11 tennis courts. There are 3 different modes to choose from, which are Challenge Mode, Tennis with Everybody, and Training Mode. In Challenge, you play against computer controlled opponents in order to unlock stuff like alternate costumes for characters and more courts to play on. In Tennis with Everybody, you can play matches with 1 to 4 players. The training mode lets you practice positioning and timing shots. You can choose from service, volley, smash and general practices in this mode.\n\nFew of the characters from the previous games of the series (both American and Japanese) make cameo appearances on the courts (usually only in Singles matches). Suzuki and Gloria return as being playable characters.\n\nIt sold over 150,000 copies during its first week on sale. The game was renamed \"Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds\" in North America.\n\nNotably, this title came with PSP System Software version 3.96 - the only place where this firmware version can be found as it was never released online. The game was renamed \"Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee 2\" in North America.\n\nWhile the game was released as a UMD and PlayStation Network download in Japan, and the rest of Asia, it was released as a PlayStation Network exclusive in Europe and North America (as \"Hot Shots Shorties\" in North America). This release was split into four download packs based on colour with three games being included in the Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue packs.\n\nThe title is a 12-game mini game collection rather than a dedicated sports titles such as previous titles in the series. Mini games include book sorting, baseball, boxing, and vegetable fighting. Certain games can be played with characters from the \"Everybody's Golf\" and \"Tennis\" games.\n\nAnother Tennis game for the PlayStation Portable. Renamed in North America as \"Hot Shots Tennis: Get a Grip\".\n\n\"Everybody's Golf 6\" borrows courses from \"Everybody's Golf 4\", and downloadable content is available through the PlayStation Store. Players are able to leave each other comments through the \"Live Area\" system. Players are able to view the golf course using PlayStation Vita's augmented reality feature. The game was renamed in North America as \"Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational\".\n\nThe first \"Everybody's Golf\" title on PlayStation 4, was released worldwide in August 2017. The game marks the end of the alternate \"Hot Shots\" branding for the North American market, with the title \"Everybody's Golf\" being used worldwide.\n\n\"Everybody's Golf VR\" is a PlayStation VR title and the first virtual reality game of the series.

{"id": "2054559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054559", "title": "Chugach National Forest", "text": "Chugach National Forest\n\nThe Chugach National Forest is a United States National Forest in south central Alaska. Covering portions of Prince William Sound, the Kenai Peninsula and the Copper River Delta, it was formed in 1907 from part of a larger forest reserve. The Chugach includes extensive shorelines, glaciers, forests and rivers, much of which is untouched by roads or trails. It hosts numerous bird, mammal and marine species, including extensive shorebird habitat and a bald eagle population larger than the contiguous 48 states combined. Human industry in the forest includes extensive tourism and some mining and oil and gas operations.\n\nThe area that is now Chugach was settled by the Inuit thousands of years ago. It was first visited by Europeans in the mid-1700s and soon settled by Russian fur traders, who trapped the native sea otters. In 1867, the US purchased Alaska from Russia and gold was found in 1888. In 1907, the Chugach National Forest was created from a portion of forest reserve, which had been one of the first of its kind, designated in 1892.\n\nIt is located in the mountains surrounding Prince William Sound including the eastern Kenai Peninsula and the delta of the Copper River. It is the second-largest (third-largest if the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest is considered as one entity) forest in the U.S. national forest system, and is the northern-most and western-most national forest. Approximately 30 percent of the area of the forest is covered by ice. Portions of the Kenai Peninsula make up approximately 21 percent of the forest, and include the southern portion of the Iditarod National Historic Trail. Parts of Prince William Sound make up about 48 percent of the forest. This includes of shoreline, 22 tidewater glaciers, and the Nellie Juan-College Fiord Wilderness Study Area, which covers . Portions of the Copper River Delta cover approximately 31 percent of the forest, and include the \"largest contiguous wetlands complex on North America's Pacific coast\". Despite its huge size, there are only of Forest Service roads, although there are also over of designated trails.\n\nThe supervisor's office is located in Anchorage. There are local ranger district offices located in Cordova, Girdwood, and Seward.\n\nIn descending order of land area within the forest, it is located in parts of the Valdez-Cordova Census Area, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Anchorage Municipality, Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Kodiak Island Borough, and Yakutat City and Borough.\n\nThe Chugach is a temperate rain forest in the Pacific temperate rain forest region. Here the forest occupies only a very narrow strip between the ocean and the icy alpine zone. The dominant trees are limited to Sitka spruce, western hemlock and mountain hemlock. This zone is known as the\"sub-polar rainforest\".\n\nThe Kenai Peninsula section of the forest is home to over 200 colonies of seabirds, as well as between 3,000 and 5,000 bald eagles. Approximately the same number of eagles live in the Chugach National Forest as live in the entire contiguous United States. The Copper River Delta portion of the forest is the largest contiguous portion of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network and is \"considered one of the most essential shorebird habitats in the world\". The Delta provides habitat for over 20 million birds annually, and during the summer, one quarter of the world's trumpeter swans and dusky Canada geese call the Delta home. Mammals that inhabit this forest include coyote, timber wolf, moose, caribou, marten, Sitka black-tailed deer, mountain goat, black bears and grizzly bears. Dall sheep are also found; the Chugach is the only national forest where these animals can be seen. Humpback whales, sea lions and otters are found in the Chugach's waters. The waters around the forest also host all five species of Pacific salmon found in North America: chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, coho salmon, chum salmon and pink salmon.\n\nThere is very little logging done in the Chugach, and less than 2 percent of the forest is considered suitable for commercial logging operations; this is unusual among national forests. Instead, the forest infuses money into local communities through tourism, recreation, mining and commercial fishing. There are over 7 million annual visitors to the Chugach National Forest, including kayakers, boaters, hikers, skiers, birders and anglers. None of the area is designated as national wilderness, although much of it qualifies under federal law. Mining, including coal and hard rock operations, and oil and gas development are found in the forest. In 2003, the Department of the Interior announced that of forest was no longer open to mining, adding that area to almost that had been previously placed off limits. The affected land borders the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Wilderness, and the department cited protecting the Russian River and upper Russian Lake Recreation Corridor as the reason for the change.\n\n\n"}

The name, from Latin \"luna\", moon, refers to the moon-shaped gemmacups.\n\n\"Lunularia\" occurs commonly in western Europe, where it is native to the region around the Mediterranean. It is also common in California, where it now grows \"wild\", and is known as an introduced weed in gardens and greenhouses in Australia. Ella Orr Campbell believed that \"Lunularia\" was introduced into New Zealand sometime after 1867. In America, the species grows only as a sterile form, easily recognized by the crescent-shaped cups containing asexual gemmae.\n\nThe discus-shaped gemmae are readily dislodged from the cups by splashes of rainwater. They can then quickly \"take root\" and start to grow in suitably damp places, which is why they are so successful in greenhouses.\n\n\"Lunularia\" is not purely asexual; it can also reproduce sexually (see illustration) with four archegonia arranged in a cross-shaped head (hence the specific name \"cruciata\") bearing diploid sporophyte plantlets. As in other liverworts, the main plant body or thallus is a haploid gametophyte.\n\nLike many other liverwort species, \"Lunularia\" produces a dihydrostilbenoid growth hormone, lunularic acid, that is reported to be a growth inhibitor of liverworts.\n\n"}

It is the US version of the UK series \"Strictly Come Dancing\", and one of several iterations of the \"Dancing with the Stars\" franchise. The show is hosted by Tom Bergeron, alongside Erin Andrews, who became co-host in season eighteen. Lisa Canning was co-host in the first season, Samantha Harris co-hosted seasons two through nine and Brooke Burke-Charvet in seasons ten through seventeen. The twenty-eighth season premiered on September 16, 2019.\n\nThe format of the show consists of a celebrity paired with a professional dancer. Each couple performs predetermined dances and competes against the others for judges' points and audience votes. The couple receiving the lowest combined total of judges' points and audience votes is eliminated each week until only the champion dance pair remains.\n\nTom Bergeron has been the host since the program's premiere in 2005. In season 1, his co-host was Lisa Canning. She was replaced by Samantha Harris for seasons 2 through 9 (2006–09), who was then replaced by Brooke Burke-Charvet from seasons 10 through 17 (2010–13). Erin Andrews took over as co-host starting in season 18 (2014). Drew Lachey served as a temporary replacement for Harris during season 5 (2007) during her absence for 3 weeks due to maternity leave. Leah Remini filled in for Andrews in week 6 of season 19, due to commitments with the 2014 World Series and filled in for her again in weeks 6 and 7 of season 21 for the 2015 World Series. Season 19 champion Alfonso Ribeiro filled in for Bergeron on week 4 of season 21, due to Bergeron's ailing father.\n\nThe regular judges are Len Goodman, who serves as head judge, Carrie Ann Inaba, and Bruno Tonioli. Goodman was absent for much of season 19, all of season 21, and much of season 23. Julianne Hough, who was a professional dancing partner for seasons 4–8, was added as a full-time judge on the panel for three seasons, 19–21, after having been a guest judge in the previous two seasons. She did not return for season 22. Hough did return as a full-time judge for seasons 23 and 24 but did not return for seasons 25 and 26. Several former contestants appeared as judges in episode 200 (in season 11), including Hélio Castroneves, Mel B, Drew Lachey, Gilles Marini, Kelly Osbourne, and Emmitt Smith. Other celebrities, most often those who are associated with the world of dancing, former professional dancers, and past contestants have appeared as the fourth judge or in absence of one of the main judges, including Paula Abdul, Donnie Burns, Nick Carter, Cher, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Michael Flatley, Kevin Hart, Jessie J, Rashad Jennings, Baz Luhrmann, Ricky Martin, Idina Menzel, Abby Lee Miller, Mandy Moore, Olivia Newton-John, Kenny Ortega, Donny Osmond, Pitbull, Redfoo, Alfonso Ribeiro, Robin Roberts, David Ross, Shania Twain, Leah Remini and Zendaya.\n\nFor 17 seasons, the Harold Wheeler orchestra and singers provided the live music for the show. On February 7, 2014, it was announced that the new bandleader is Ray Chew. Along with him is a new band of instrumentalists and singers.\n\nColor key:\n\nA total of 321 celebrities have appeared in the 28 seasons of the series. For each season, the celebrities are paired with a professional partner who instructs them in the various dances each week and competes alongside them in the televised competition. A total of 46 professional partners have appeared alongside celebrities, some for only one season (mostly in the earliest seasons).\n\nKey:\n\nIn season 12, the show introduced the troupe consisting of professional dancers who perform on the show but are not paired with celebrity partners. The first troupe in season 12 included Oksana Dmytrenko, Tristan MacManus, Peta Murgatroyd, Kiki Nyemchek, Nicole Volynets, and Ted Volynets. Other past troupe members include Artur Adamski, Brandon Armstrong, Lindsay Arnold, Alan Bersten, Sharna Burgess, Henry Byalikov, Witney Carson, Brittany Cherry, Dasha Chesnokova, Artem Chigvintsev, Hayley Erbert, Sasha Farber, Shannon Holtzapffel, Dennis Jauch, Jenna Johnson, Kiril Kulish, Vladislav Kvartin, Morgan Larson, Keo Motsepe, Sonny Fredie Pedersen, Gleb Savchenko, Emma Slater Britt Stewart and Julz Tocker.\n\nKey:\n\nIn seasons 1 and 2, only the overall ranking between competitors by the judges and the public was relevant. In season 3 and all subsequent seasons, the scoring system has made the exact scores relevant as well.\n\nThe scoring begins with the judges' marks. Each judge gives a numeric score from 1 to 10, for a total score of 3 to 30. The scoring was altered for the \"all-star\" season 15, during which judges could give scores at 1/2-point intervals from 0.5 to 10, for a total score of 1.5 to 30. When multiple performances are scored, only the cumulative total counts. The contestants' judges' shares are calculated as the percentage of the total number of points awarded to all contestants that evening. (For example, if a team earned 20 pts on a night when the judges awarded 200 pts, their judges' share would be 20/200 = 10%.) This percentage is then added to the percentage of North American votes received by each contestant. The lowest-scoring two couples are identified at the end of the show, and the couple with the lowest combined total gets eliminated. Season 8 added an occasional 'dance-off', in which contestants could re-perform one of their dances, in an effort to improve their judges' score. This was later discontinued.\n\nPublic voting is conducted via a toll-free number, the ABC website, and, most recently, text messages and Facebook; contestants can vote during and immediately after each performance show. The maximum number of votes per voter per medium is equal to the number of couples performing that night, or five votes, whichever is larger. In April 2010, it was revealed that former contestant Kate Gosselin had e-mailed friends and family asking them to vote as many as 10 times each. In November 2010, \"The Washington Post\" reported that online voting appeared not to require a valid email address, and accordingly that numerous votes apparently could be cast by one person.\n\nIn several cases where ESPN coverage of \"Monday Night Football\" airs instead on an ABC affiliate in an NFL team's home market, the program is delayed to air immediately after that station's local news, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\", and \"Nightline\", and a voting window confined only to the area codes of the pre-empted market is opened up to allow affected viewers to still put their votes in for the competition, though this is on a market-by-market basis (in some markets, an alternate sister station or digital subchannel carries the program live as scheduled).\n\nSeasons 1 and 3 featured only two couples in the final week instead of three. Starting with season 16, four couples made it into the final week, although the top three finalists proceeded to dance one more time for the judges after the fourth place couple was announced. In seasons 20, 22, 24, and 26 there were three couples in the final week, but in seasons 21, 23, 25, 27, and 28 there were four.\n\nOn the April 18, 2006, episode of the \"Howard Stern Radio Show\", Stern's wife Beth said that she was guaranteed to earn $125,000 for just appearing on \"DWTS\" (in season 3) and could earn up to more than double the original sum, depending on how long she lasted on the program.\n\nIn season 21, Bindi Irwin had her payments withheld by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge because she was a minor, which therefore required her parents to sign-off on the contract. But although her mother signed, the contract lacked her father's signature, so the judge refused to validate the contract, despite Irwin's father being the world-famous naturalist Steve Irwin, whose death in 2006 had been widely covered in the news/media. The judge later validated the contract once Steve Irwin's death certificate was presented to the court, resulting in Bindi receiving a $350,000 paycheck from the show.\n\nThe first person to withdraw from competition was Romeo in season 2. His father, Master P, took his place in the competition before the beginning of broadcasts, being partnered with Ashly DelGrosso. However, Romeo later competed in season 12 and finished in 5th place. He was partnered with Chelsie Hightower.\n\nOn week six in season three, Sara Evans cited her divorce as the reason for leaving the competition. No one was eliminated that week.\n\nAnother withdrawal occurred during the run-up to season four on February 28, when Vincent Pastore withdrew from the competition after only one week of training. Pastore said he did not realize how much work was needed during a ten-week period, and that he was not up to the physical demands of the show. He was replaced on March 2 by Pixar voice actor John Ratzenberger who was partnered with Edyta Sliwinska.\n\nIn season seven, Misty May-Treanor withdrew from the competition in week three, after rupturing her Achilles tendon when rehearsing her jive with her partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy. She did not perform the routine at all nor was she scored for it; no one else was eliminated that week.\n\nIn season eight, Jewel and Nancy O'Dell were injured before the season even began and could not compete. Jewel was diagnosed with fractured tibias in both legs; she came back later in the season to perform \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" on a results show. O'Dell suffered from a torn knee cartilage. They were replaced by Holly Madison and Melissa Rycroft who would be dancing with their partners for the rest of the season (Dmitry Chaplin and Tony Dovolani).\n\nTom DeLay, in season nine, withdrew in week three of competition due to a full stress fracture that had developed in both feet from an earlier pre-stress fracture in one foot. DeLay was declared safe before he announced his withdrawal during the October 6, 2009 results show. Debi Mazar was still eliminated that night despite DeLay's departure.\n\nIn season sixteen, Olympic figure skating champion Dorothy Hamill had to withdraw from the competition due to doctor's orders for a spinal injury. A cyst had developed near her lower spine, and was pinching off the nerve in that area. Either boxing champion Victor Ortiz or reality TV star Lisa Vanderpump would have been eliminated, but Hamill withdrew before the results could be announced, meaning that no one was eliminated that week.\n\nIn season eighteen, week three, actor Billy Dee Williams withdrew, by advice from a doctor, due to a chronic back problem (which resulted in no elimination that week).\n\nIn season twenty-one, week three, reality TV star Kim Zolciak-Biermann was forced to withdraw from the competition after suffering a blood clot which resulted in a mini stroke (which resulted in no elimination that week). Tamar Braxton also withdrew from the season due to blood clots in her lungs making it the first season to have two withdrawals in it.\n\nIn season twenty eight, Christie Brinkley withdrew the competition a week before the season premiere, due to injuring her arm during rehearsal and needing sudden surgery. She was replaced by her daughter, Sailor with only a few days to practice prior to the season premiere. Later that season, Ray Lewis withdrew the competition in the third week due to a toe injury he sustained during rehearsal that needed surgery. This is the second season to have two withdrawals.\n\nBeginning in season 7, viewers had the opportunity to vote for their favorite professional dancers (or in some cases former contestants) to perform a particular style of dance to a song, also of their choice. An online contest is also usually held so that viewers can submit drawings of outfits for the performance.\n\nThe show celebrated its 100th episode on Tuesday, May 6, 2008, during week 8 of season 6. More than 30 former cast members and pros returned, with interviews with Stacy Keibler, Lisa Rinna, Jerry Springer, Vivica A. Fox, Joey Fatone, Kenny Mayne, Sabrina Bryan, and former winners Kelly Monaco, Drew Lachey, and Apolo Anton Ohno. Other appearances, besides the season 6 cast, included Paula Abdul (in a video introduction), Jane Seymour, Ian Ziering, Mark Cuban, Wayne Newton, Leeza Gibbons, Harry Hamlin, Shandi Finnessey, and Hélio Castroneves. New routines were performed by Apolo Anton Ohno and Julianne Hough, Mel B and Maksim Chmerkovskiy, and by Mario Lopez with the cast of \"A Chorus Line\", in which he was starring on Broadway. The musical guest was country group Rascal Flatts.\n\nThe judges also presented a countdown of their choices for the top 10 perfect-scoring dances of the 1st 5 seasons. Their choices were:\nIn season 11, viewers were allowed two votes per day on the \"DWTS\" website to vote for their favorite out of 30 given choices. On Oct 25, 2010, a countdown of the Top 10 voted for dances on the show was reported to celebrate the following week when the 200th show would be.\nOn the actual 200th show, several dances were performed again on the show and six of the past fan favorites came back to judge; Helio Castroneves, Emmitt Smith, Drew Lachey, Kelly Osbourne, Gilles Marini, Mel B, and more. The couples re-created their most memorable routines on the 200th episode; Kristi Yamaguchi and Apolo Ohno served as team captains for the team dances. Yamaguchi's team consisted of Rick & Cheryl, Kyle & Lacey and Bristol & Mark, while Brandy & Maksim, Jennifer & Derek and Kurt & Anna were on Ohno's team. On the results show of November 2, some awards were given out to past celebrity contestants and professionals.\n\nThe 300th episode took place on the week 9 results show of season 16. Twenty-two professional dancers who had appeared on the show, both past and present, performed an opening number choreographed by Jason Gilkinson. Past pros who performed were Chelsie Hightower, Dmitry Chaplin, Louis Van Amstel, and Anna Trebunskaya. Kellie Pickler and Derek Hough danced their \"Argentine tango\" as the week's encore. However, the top 10 dances were not revealed, nor were the achievements.\n\nThe 400th episode took place on the season premiere of the twenty-fourth season. Tom Bergeron did mention the milestone, however, no special dances took place.\n\nOn April 28, 2015, during season 20, a special pre-recorded episode aired as a 10th anniversary special with many former stars and professional dancers returning to the ballroom. Many past stars performed and reflected on their time on the show. Patti LaBelle, Amber Riley, and Lil' Kim performed LaBelle's \"Lady Marmalade\". The show closed with the largest number of people dancing in the show's history as stars, pros, hosts, and judges were all out on the dance floor.\n\nIn seasons 9 and 10, three tribute performances were done to honor the memory of artists and others. The first was a tribute to recently deceased actor Patrick Swayze, on Sep 23, 2009. \"She's Like the Wind\" from the \"Dirty Dancing\" soundtrack (originally written by Swayze for \"Dirty Dancing\"), \"Unchained Melody\" from his film \"Ghost\", and \"(I've Had) The Time of my Life\" from \"Dirty Dancing\" were performed by select professional dancers of the show.\n\nOn October 20, 2009, a tribute was done for singer and dancer, Michael Jackson. \"I Want You Back\", \"Man in the Mirror\", and \"Thriller\" were performed—the first two songs by select professional dancers of the show, with all coming together for \"Thriller\".\n\nIn season 10, professional Haitian dancers performed as a tribute to victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake on March 30, 2010. One of the male dancers, Emmanuel Pierre-Antoine, had lost his son in the rubble. They were dancing to \"Dance Like This\" by Wyclef Jean.\n\nIn season 24, to honor the passing of season 11 contestant Florence Henderson on November 24, 2016, a special tribute to Henderson was displayed on the dance floor. The season 24 premiere aired on March 20, 2017.\n\nIn season 28, at the end of the premiere episode, a tribute was placed on the dance floor to honor the passing of actress and season 17 contestant Valerie Harper who died on August 30, 2019. Her star was placed right next to Florence Henderson's.\n\nA DVD titled \"Dancing With The Stars: Cardio Dance\" was released on April 3, 2007, featuring Kym Johnson, Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Ashly DelGrosso. The program contains cardiovascular workouts adapted from cha-cha, Paso doble, samba, and jive dance routines.\n\nA second DVD \"Dancing with the Stars: Latin Cardio Dance\" was released on September 13, 2008, featuring Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Cheryl Burke. The program contains cardiovascular workouts adapted from cha-cha, Merengue, samba and mambo dance routines.\n\nA companion book written by Guy Phillips was released in the early fall of 2007. Titled \"Dancing with the Stars: Jive, Samba and Tango Your Way Into The Best Shape Of Your Life\", the book includes fitness routines modeled by Alec Mazo and Edyta Sliwinska, as well as original costume designs, lists of performed songs during a dance, and a complete list of song-and-dance routine performed since the first season of the show.\n\nThe first \"Dancing\" spin-off, \"\", premiered on January 7, 2008, on ABC. The show's format was similar to the BBC Television series, \"DanceX\". The show was canceled after one season.\n\nA figure skating spin-off similar to ITV's \"Dancing on Ice\" called \"Skating with the Stars\" aired on ABC on November 22, 2010. The series was canceled after one season.\n\nOn May 16, 2017, a \"\" spin-off was announced. The dance competition spin-off was originally set to premiere in the spring of 2018 on ABC, and the format of the show will feature celebrity children and the children of celebrities paired with professional junior ballroom dancers. In January 2018, ABC stated that \"Dancing with the Stars: Juniors\" is still in the works, but didn't develop as quickly they hoped it would. \"Athletes\" aired in its place, with \"Juniors\" originally slated to air that summer. However, In May 2018, it was announced that the series would begin airing on October 7, 2018, with filming taking place during August 2018. Professional skateboarder Sky Brown, junior pro JT Church and pro mentor Alan Bersten were announced as the winners on December 9, 2018. The show was canceled after one season.\n\nBack in 2016 ABC, together with BBC Worldwide, commissioned a game to come out alongside the beloved show. Published by Donut Publishing, developed by Exient Entertainment, the match-3 mobile game has gathered a considerable fanbase. The game uses a mix of hand animation and motion-captured data for all the dances in the game, using pro dancers from the UK version of the show - the Strictly Come Dancing. The game features over 150 dresses in the game and 9 dances: Quickstep, Jive, Tango, Salsa, Charleston, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha Cha Cha, and Paso Doble.\n\nDuring development, Dave Hawkins, CEO, said, “We’re extremely excited and honoured to become a part of the massive success story that is Dancing With The Stars and our partnership with the BBC has resulted in a game that will break new boundaries in Match 3. By taking DWTS into the mobile space, we aim to showcase the talent, spectacle, fashion, drama and pure joy that is a night of glam and glitz in the palm of your hands.”\nHarriet Frost, Brand Manager for Dancing with the Stars, added “We’re thrilled to have an exciting and entertaining Dancing with the Stars mobile game to introduce to all our passionate fans around the world. As one of the world's biggest entertainment brands, Dancing with the Stars is inventive, creative, glamorous and exciting and these values are all represented in our new mobile game. We’re delighted by how the game is developing and hope it will provide our fans with a new fun way to interact with the Dancing with the Stars brand and engage, excite and entertain our fantastic community across the globe.”\n\nAn unofficial live tour show called \"Dancing Pros: Live!\" toured with several \"Dancing\" pros since 2010. A \"Dancing with the Stars: Live!\" official tour was announced on November 3, 2014, for the 2014–2015 season starting on December 27, 2014, in Niagara Falls, New York, and ending February 15, 2015, hitting 33 cities.

The tour began on December 15, 2018, in Columbia, South Carolina, and ended on March 9, 2019, in Thousand Oaks, California.\nIn 2016, a \"The New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"unlike \"So You Think You Can Dance\", which is generally more of a city show, \"Dancing with the Stars\" is most popular in the countryside. It also has a higher share of 'likes' from viewers aged 65 and up than any other show.\"\n\nThe program has also been nominated for various other production-related awards since premiering in 2005, including for hairstyling, makeup, lighting design, and technical direction.\n\n\n"}

It was disbanded in May 1944 and reformed as a fighter/ground attack squadron flying F4U Corsairs. It served in Santo, Guadalcanal, Los Negros and Emirau, before returning to New Zealand and being disbanded in September 1945. A SBD-4 Dauntless operated by 25 Squadron was for a time preserved in the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum at Wigram, displayed in the condition which it was recovered after being lost with its crew while on a training mission at Espiritu Santo. One of the SBD-5 aircraft operated by 25 Squadron has been restored to flying condition in America for the \"Planes of Fame\" museum, in the colour scheme of an American aircraft.\n\n25 Squadron was formed at Seagrove, near Auckland, on 31 July 1943 with twelve crews and a maintenance unit. This was later increased to eighteen crews. The commanding officer was Squadron Leader Theodore Jasper Maclean de Lange (born Simla 16 June 1914, died Rotorua 4 July 2005), a burly and moustachioed figure who later became the Air Member for Personnel. He became a CBE in 1965 and retired in February 1966. Other members of the squadron were mostly from the army co-operation and anti-aircraft units, with an average age of 23 years, although at least one pilot (Leslie McLellan-Symonds b. 1911) was older than de Lange.\n\nThe initial supply of aircraft was nine SBD-3 aircraft from MAG-14. These machines were reputed to be veterans of the earlier Pacific battles and were in poor condition.\n\nFor the next few months the crews trained while the maintenance personnel struggled to keep the aircraft flying, requesting and receiving several more SBD-3 (and later SBD-4) machines from the Americans to maintain operational numbers. The aeroplanes were operated in their original USMC markings with squadron numbers painted on, until being \"brought on charge\" in November 1943. On completion of initial training, the squadron celebrated by flying eighteen aeroplanes over Auckland just before luncheon on 6 January 1944, to the great interest of the civilian population.\n\nOn 30 January 1944 squadron personnel were flown by Lodestar and C-47 aircraft of 40 Squadron to Espiritu Santo for further training with American units. A further supply of eighteen SBD-4 aircraft were awaiting them, but these were almost as decrepit as the machines they had left behind in New Zealand. Nevertheless, the squadron was able to complete training in gunnery, dive-bombing and formation flying. It was during this training period that NZ5037 went missing with both crew members while on a practice Beam Approach. Despite extensive searches no trace of the 'plane or its crew was found. NZ5037 remained lost in the jungle until 1987 when it was located and returned to New Zealand by 3 Squadron.\n\nThe squadron received eighteen new SBD-5 aircraft in February 1944. The intention was to deploy the squadron immediately at Piva Airfield on the island of Bougainville, but due to the tenuous state of the Allied beachhead on the island, deployment was delayed until the risk of shelling on the Piva Airfield had reduced.\n\n25 Squadron flew in its SBD-5s to Guadalcanal on 22 March, escorted by four Venturas and one C-47 from 40 Squadron. A Catalina from 6 Squadron stood by at Halavo Seaplane Base in the Florida Islands as a safety aircraft. At Guadalcanal NZ5055, piloted by F/O Bruce Graham, swerved on landing at Henderson Field and collided with an oil-drum, the plane was written off. From Henderson Field the squadron flew to Piva Airfield on 23 January. While in transit, the gunner in NZ5063 inadvertently fired his stowed machine-guns and caused considerable damage to the fuselage. The guns were not supposed to be able to be fired while pointed at any part of the aircraft. Upon landing at Piva, the New Zealanders found themselves on a narrow beachhead, with Japanese forces shelling and attacking the perimeter.\n\nThe first mission flown from Piva was an artillery-spotting exercise undertaken by MacLean de Lange and his gunner at 06:15 on 24 March. Over the course of the day, the squadron flew three more sorties against the Japanese. So close were the enemy, that during one of these raids, ground crew on the airstrip were able to watch the pilots drop their bombs.\n\n25 Squadron flew missions from Piva for approximately eight weeks. During this time they flew almost daily missions against Japanese forces on Bougainville and New Britain. Many of the missions were against airfields near the Japanese stronghold of Rabaul. \n\nIn addition, dozens of artillery pieces were destroyed and considerable damage caused to airfields and other military property.\n\nNZ5055 crashed and was written off at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal on March 22. NZ5054 and NZ5059 crashed and burned on landing at Piva on April 2 after a strike when their \"hung-up\" bombs jolted loose and exploded. NZ5058 was written off due to damage received over Rabaul on April 17.\n\nStalled while low flying near Waiuku, New Zealand on 13 September 1943 and crashed and burned with the loss of PLTOFF William McJannet and SGT Douglas Cairns.\n\nNZ5037 with its crew of FGOFF Alexander Moore and FSGT John Munro went missing on 11 February at Espiritu Santo on a radio range familiarisation flight. The aircraft went missing in the cloud covered hills around the area and despite extensive searches the wreckage was not found until 1987.\n\nOn 4 April a flight of three SBDs flying to Piva from Henderson Field became lost and one aircraft, a replacement coded \"176\" piloted by FGOFF Leslie McLellan-Symonds separated from the flight and disappeared. Radio transmissions received later that evening suggested that he was planning to ditch near the Tanga Islands. It has never been established how or where his flight ended, although the most likely scenario is that he ditched or bailed out near the Tanga Islands. McLellan-Symonds was later captured and shot in the left thigh by the Japanese and transported to Rabaul, where he was interned at Tunnel Hill Road. McLellan-Symonds' last days were described by one of his fellow prisoners, Jose Holguin, in his testimonial written in 1948, reproduced in part below.\n\nOn 17 April the squadron supplied twelve SBDs to take part in a strike of 86 aircraft against the Japanese airfield at Lakunai, near Rabaul. NZ5050 was last seen over the target and is presumed to have been hit by AAA and crashed into a ravine with the loss of PLTOFF Geoffrey Cray and FSGT Frank Bell.\n\nFranklin Mint has produced a cast-metal model of NZ5050 but it is painted in \"jungle camouflage\". In fact, all SBD-5s operated by 25 Squadron were painted in the USN \"three-colour scheme\" of sea-blue upper surfaces, intermediate blue sides and white undersurfaces. Detailed and well-researched colour-schemes can be seen on Peter Mossong's website .\n\nOn 10 May a force of 34 aircraft including twelve 25 Squadron SBDs attacked Lakunai and nearby gun positions. NZ5051, crewed by FLTLT Jack Edwards and W/O Lou Hoppe, released its bombs but was hit by AAA as it pulled up over the runway. The SBD crashed into Greet (Matupi) Harbour with the loss of both crew.\n\n25 Squadron's tour ended on 20 May. At 0700 the seventeen SBDs took off from Piva and landed at Renard Field in the Russell Islands where the aircraft were returned to American ownership, reportedly in \"as new\" condition. The squadron personnel were flown to RNZAF Base Whenuapai the following day.\n\n25 Squadron was disbanded and reformed, with a new commanding officer, as a fighter-bomber squadron equipped with F4U Corsairs (F4U-1s and F4U-1Ds). Several pilots transferred to the new squadron, including Graham Howie who was killed on take-off when his engine failed and he crashed into the jungle on 13 June 1945.\n\n"}

Master Teacher's teachings also incorporate elements from the New Testament, and from other various spiritual and religious leaders. \nThe community lists itself as an \"international school of enlightenment\", and also as a seminary.\n\nThe stated purpose of the community was to provide its members with a \"universal experience of oneness that is ideally the goal of every spiritual tradition.\" The Academy Journal promises \"an intensive encounter with Singular Reality and a forum for the complete transformation to enlightenment that is the inevitable destiny of mankind.\" Standard teaching sessions were provided for students on a daily basis, and an introductory session for the public was given each Sunday. \nThe organization, was headquartered in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, USA and had affiliate centers in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Mexico.\n\nEndeavor Academy, was founded in 1992 by Charles Buell Anderson (b. ca. 1926, d. 2008). Anderson described his 'Spiritual Awakening' as a spontaneous experience he had in 1979. A certain pair of earlier extraordinary experiences Anderson had, may offer some insight into Anderson's later experience of 'Spiritual Awakening'.\n\nThe \"first\" of these two earlier extraordinary experiences was Anderson's World War II experience in Nagasaki, Japan. Anderson's Nagasaki experience appears to have made a deeply profound and formative impression upon him. In a letter to the \"Atomic Veteran's History Project,\" Anderson described how, with the Marines 6th Regiment, he was one of the first to land at Nagasaki after the atomic bombing of that city in 1945, where he was faced with a vast and overwhelming feeling of the devastation he was witnessing:\n\nAnderson wrote that his second such experience came 26 years later in 1971, during a 'Near Death Experience' he had. Anderson wrote that during this second such experience, he had a certain \"space of peace and happiness\" while lying on what he presumed would be his deathbed, and that also during this second event, he received a spontaneous healing from cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS News\", Anderson denied having followers, teaching that \"the Light is in everyone\" and that \"You are the light of the world.\" He claimed to be \"returning to heaven\" \"shortly\", and said that \"everybody\" will be going with him. \"There's nothing dangerous about me,\" Anderson explained, \"I am the danger of eternal love.\"\n\nSince Anderson's passing in 2008, the Academy and its affiliates have so far continued to remain active, and have continued to produce and disseminate instructional materials.\n\nFollowing Anderson's passing, the nature of, and names of, the ongoing leadership of the Academy is unknown.\n\nAt the end of 2006 film director Jubi Onyeama and producer Cameron Kennedy, both students of Endeavor Academy, started to interview approximately 120 fellow students. In April 2007 Endeavor Academy sent a film crew to Edinburgh, Scotland to interview additional students and teachers from affiliated centers in Europe. The film was shot over an approximately 2-year period and required more than 200 hours of shooting for the 4-part documentary. The movie, \"\"A Course in Miracles Unleashed\"\" was released on Labor Day 2008. The movie was first screened at Sundance Cinema Madison, WI and received much attention on the internet, IMDb. Within the first year of release, the documentary has been subtitled in Dutch, German, Polish, Spanish and Swedish. The documentary about the individual awakening of the students from Endeavor Academy was also screened at the Parliament of World Religions 2009 in Melbourne, Australia. Teachers from Endeavor Academy also represented \"A Course in Miracles\" at the 2004 Parliament of World Religions in Barcelona, Spain and at the 2000 Millennium World Peace Summit at the United Nations in New York City.\n\nAnderson received a copy of \"A Course in Miracles\" ca. 1982. In 1991 he first registered the organization in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, USA under its original name, which was \"God’s Country Place\" (GCP). This organization was based on many of the teachings of \"ACIM\", as well as some Biblical and AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) materials. By 1999, Endeavor Academy had grown to accommodate 500 residents.\n\nIn 1992 the organization was registered to operate under the names Endeavor Academy and New Christian Church of Full Endeavor. Around this time, the use of the GCP name was discontinued.\n\nEndeavor Academy's headquarters was a converted summer resort facility located in a diverse area of water parks and tourist attractions in the middle of Wisconsin Dells. The original facility of 1991 was a large main house, but in 1992 a summer resort motel complex was acquired and converted to meet its needs.\n\nIn 1994 they opened the doors of the Miracles Healing Center for the first time. A lot with the Miracles Healing Center in the middle. The lot holds also the Revelation Hall where big International events where held and four houses for the residential community are located.\n\nEvery Sunday,\"Bible Alive\" services are held in their Miracles Healing Center building on Highway 23 in Wisconsin Dells. On the roadside they have a billboard promoting their Miracles Healing Center with \"Always Open, Everyone Welcome\". On their website is an email address and phone number for prayer requests that can be reached 24/7. In that same building twice a week, 12-step and AA-meetings are hosted by Academy teachers and students as a service to the community.\n\nFor several years now, students have participated in helping inmates by offering them the 12-step program through their Miracles Prisoner Ministry.\nThe Miracles Prisoner Ministry is supporting the Christian Association for Prison Aftercare, Wisconsin Network for Peace & Justice, Madison-area Urban Ministry, Inc.\n\nEndeavor Academy's primary text, \"A Course in Miracles\", was published and distributed between 1995 and 2000 by Penguin Books. As a result of litigation with Endeavor Academy the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP) copyright claims were largely voided in 2003 on the grounds of general distribution prior to obtaining copyright, thus placing the majority of the material previously claimed by FIP as under copyright protection in the public domain.\nAs a result of the copyright litigation, three earlier limited editions or drafts of \"A Course in Miracles\" surfaced (the Urtext draft, \"Hugh Lynn Cayce\" edition, and the \"Criswell\" edition), which also fell into the public domain. The US Trademark Office canceled both the Servicemark on \"A Course in Miracles\" and the Trademark on the acronym, \"ACIM\" in 2005. EA publishes their own edition of ACIM, called \"The Advent of a Great Awakening\" edition. This EA edition is currently available in print through many major book retailers. Meanwhile, the Foundation for Inner Peace continues to also publish its version of the \"ACIM\" text, which also includes the smaller sections for which the copyright was upheld, and which the FIP claims to still be the only unabridged and complete version of the \"ACIM\" text available.\n\n"}

When they are discovered by their parents the next morning, the boys barricade the door until they are promised the calves will be safe. Sharon refuses to lie and say they will be safe out of fear of regretting it, and Randy can not remove the door without destroying the house.\n\nThe situation quickly escalates into a standoff between the boys, who are declared terrorists, and the police. They live off some food smuggled in by Ms. Cartman, which contains meat. While most of the group eagerly eats this food, Stan does not, as his reason for doing the deed extends far beyond just protecting the calves, so he becomes a vegetarian. Cartman makes fun of this, saying \"if you don't eat meat, you become a pussy.\" Later, Stan comes down with a strange illness, and develops sores on his face.\n\nAn FBI negotiator proves no match for Cartman's powers of manipulation, and he negotiates for guns and ammunition in return for a calf. When the boys get the guns Cartman further manipulates the negotiator for an ICBM, but unsuccessfully tries to get North and South Dakota. He gets the FDA to change the term for veal to \"tortured baby cow\", and negotiates for a cattle truck driven by Michael Dorn. Furthermore, Dorn is forced into full Worf makeup and must call Cartman 'Captain'. He is to drive everyone to the airport so they can escape to Mexico, despite being reluctant to do so. All of this, without handing over a single calf. The negotiator, due to easily giving to these ludicrous demands, is eventually fired. \n\nThe FBI double-crosses the boys and the calves are saved, but are rendered useless, as there is now no market for \"little tortured baby cow\". Stan has to go to the hospital; it turns out Cartman was correct about the results of not eating meat when Stan's doctor explains that he has vaginitis, and the sores on his face were actually vaginas, which would have turned him into a giant vagina. The episode ends with the boys, with the possible exception of Cartman, getting grounded, but not before going out with their parents for burgers.\n\nIn the DVD commentary, the creators said they wanted to balance their message of not eating baby animals, by at the same time not advocating people abstain from meat consumption altogether. Randy Marsh compares the boys to \"little John Walkers.\" This is meant as a reference to John Walker Lindh, an American who fought for the Taliban. Michael Dorn is famous for playing Lieutenant Commander Worf on \"\" and \"\". He is portrayed in this episode wearing a sweatshirt which bears the logo of Pasadena City College, his real-life alma mater. After this episode was broadcast, Dorn revealed that he is a fan of \"South Park\", and would have provided his own voice for the episode had he been asked. Dorn himself is a vegan.\nThe negotiations over the phone, the cattle truck, and most of this episode (such as the part when Cartman was standing outside the front door ordering that the men step back) was a parody of the cult classic 1975 film Dog Day Afternoon.\n\n\"Fun with Veal\", along with the sixteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Sixth Season\", were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10.\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds / Redlegs, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Baltimore Orioles and Chicago Cubs. Hatton is most identified with his native Texas: he was born in Beaumont, attended the University of Texas at Austin, managed minor league teams in Houston and San Antonio, and was an important contributor to the early years of Major League Baseball's Houston Astros.\n\nHatton batted left-handed and threw right-handed, standing and weighing . He came to the Majors in 1946 without any minor league seasoning after serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Hatton made his MLB debut against the Chicago Cubs on April 16, going three for five with two runs batted in in a 4–3 loss. Hatton would bat .254 with 91 home runs and 1,068 hits over his 12-year big league career in 1,312 games played.\n\nHe appeared in 116 games in 1946, the first of his six consecutive seasons as Cincinnati's regular third baseman. In , Hatton moved to second base and was selected to the National League All-Star team, although he didn't play in the July 8 game at Shibe Park (and hit only .212 for the season).\n\nHowever, in 1954, his tenure in Cincinnati came to an abrupt end when he appeared in only one game for the Redlegs before being traded to the Chicago White Sox on April 18. The ChiSox in turn sent him to the Boston Red Sox five weeks later—swapping him and cash for eventual Hall of Fame third baseman George Kell. He was Boston's regular third baseman in –55, then spent in a utility role for the Red Sox, St. Louis Cardinals and Baltimore Orioles. In he finally played in the minor leagues, for the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League.\n\nFrom 1958–60, Hatton was the player-manager of the Double-A San Antonio Missions (and briefly served as a playing coach for the 1960 Cubs). He started the campaign as manager of the Triple-A Houston Buffs, but he resigned early in the season to become the director of player personnel for the expansion Houston Colt .45s of the National League, set to begin play in . He moved back into uniform as manager of Houston's Triple-A Oklahoma City 89ers farm in the Pacific Coast League from 1963–65 and was named minor league manager of the year for 1965 by The Sporting News.\n\nHatton succeeded Luman Harris as the (renamed) Astros' manager for 1966, while also carrying the additional title of club vice president and sharing general manager duties with Spec Richardson and Tal Smith. It was expected that Hatton would be able to harness the young talent he had developed at Triple-A. But the three-headed general manager experiment ended after 1966, with Richardson assuming sole GM duties, and Hatton's Astros compiled a record of only 164–221 (.426) in 2½ years. He was replaced as skipper by Harry Walker midway through the 1968 campaign, on June 17. At the time, Houston was 23–38 and tenth and last in the National League.\n\nHe remained with the Astros as a scout from 1968–72, and as a Major League coach in 1973–74. He was still active in baseball in the late 1980s as a scout for the San Francisco Giants.\n\nHatton died from natural causes on April 11, 2013. He was 90.\n"}
{"id": "2054595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054595", "title": "Arvida, Quebec", "text": "Arvida, Quebec\n\nArvida ( ) is a settlement of 12,000 people (2010) in Quebec, Canada, that is part of the City of Saguenay. Its name is derived from the name of its founder, Arthur Vining Davis, president of the Alcoa aluminum company (later Alcan).\n\nArvida was founded as an industrial city by Alcoa in 1927, when the first aluminum smelter was constructed. Located north of Quebec City, south of the Saguenay River between Chicoutimi and Jonquière, the town was planned from the first day and was developed as a company town, to have a population of about 14,000 inhabitants, four Catholic parishes, and many other denominations, parishes and schools. It was known as \"the City Built in 135 Days\" and described by \"The New York Times\" as a \"model town for working families\" on \"a North Canada steppe\". \n\nIn 1912 James B. Duke purchased the rights to the power on the Saguenay River, and in 1925 the Isle Maligne power station near Lac St. Jean came on stream (then the world's largest). In 1926 more than 250 houses were completed and the first ingots were poured. In 1932 Chute-à-Caron power station near Kénogami came on stream. The Shipshaw power station, just below Chute-à-Caron, came on stream during World War II and the Saguenay Inn in Arvida was completed. In 1950 the Arvida Bridge, an arched aluminum bridge, was completed, spanning the old Saguenay gorge near the Shipshaw power house. \n\nDuring World War II, the smelter was expanded and a large hydroelectric complex was built on the Saguenay River at Shipshaw (1 200 000 HP), becoming the largest aluminum production centre in the Western world. Because of its importance to the Allied war effort, the town was guarded by anti-aircraft batteries. The smelter transforms imported bauxite to alumina, and then to aluminum, by electrolysis. This process, and the smelting plant thereto, employed up to 7,500 people in the 1950s and the 1960s. The plant was due to close in 2005, as it had been replaced by at least three plants constructed during the last ten years in the Saguenay area. Rio Tinto Alcan continues to operate a smelter and related plants in the Arvida area.\n\nIn the early 1970s, survivors of the 1971 landslide at nearby Saint-Jean-Vianney were largely resettled to Arvida.\n\nIn 1975, the cities of Arvida, Kénogami and Jonquière were amalgamated into a new city, Jonquière. In 2002, this amalgamated Jonquière was merged with Lac-Kénogami, Shipshaw, Chicoutimi, Laterrière, La Baie and Tremblay township into the city of Saguenay.\n\nIn 2010, local Councillor Carl Dufour and others sought recognition from Parks Canada as a heritage site, the first step in applying for recognition as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nArtist Claire Beaulieu was born in Arvida.\n\nCampbell is a good history of the development of aluminum smelting in the Saguenay. Hartwick's more recent book reports on work between 1950 and 68 at Labs in Arvida to develop a new industrial smelting process, the so-called monochloride process.\n\n\nIn 2011, writer Samuel Archibald, raised in Arvida, published a collection of short stories, Arvida, that won several Francophone literary prizes. In 2015, the collection was translated into English by Donald Winkler (Biblioasis Books) and was short-listed for the 2015 Scotiabank Giller Prize.\n\n"}
{"id": "2054605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054605", "title": "Coconino National Forest", "text": "Coconino National Forest\n\nThe Coconino National Forest is a 1.856-million acre (751,000 ha) United States National Forest located in northern Arizona in the vicinity of Flagstaff. Originally established in 1898 as the \"San Francisco Mountains National Forest Reserve\", the area was designated a U.S. National Forest in 1908 when the San Francisco Mountains National Forest Reserve was merged with lands from other surrounding forest reserves to create the Coconino National Forest. Today, the Coconino National Forest contains diverse landscapes, including deserts, ponderosa pine forests, flatlands, mesas, alpine tundra, and ancient volcanic peaks. The forest surrounds the towns of Sedona and Flagstaff and borders four other national forests; the Kaibab National Forest to the west and northwest, the Prescott National Forest to the southwest, the Tonto National Forest to the south, and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest to the southeast. The forest contains all or parts of ten designated wilderness areas, including the Kachina Peaks Wilderness, which includes the summit of the San Francisco Peaks. The headquarters are in Flagstaff. There are local ranger district offices in Flagstaff, Happy Jack, and Sedona.\n\nCoconino is the word the Hopi use for Havasupai and Yavapai Indians. The Coconino National Forest was so named because it is located in the central portion of Coconino County.\n\nThe elevation in the forest ranges from 2,600 feet (800 m) in the southern part of the forest near the Verde River to 12,633 feet (3,851 m) at the summit of Humphreys Peak, the highest point in the state of Arizona. Much of the forest is a high altitude plateau (average elevation is roughly 7,000 feet (2,100 m) on the plateau) that is located in the midst of the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in North America. The southern border of this plateau is the Mogollon Rim, a nearly 400 mile (640 km) long escarpment running across central Arizona that also marks the southern boundary of the Colorado Plateau. The Coconino National Forest is divided into three districts that each possess their own distinct geography and environments.\n\nThe northernmost district, known as the Flagstaff District, is home to the San Francisco Peaks, an ancient group of volcanic summits. The highest peak, Humphreys Peak, is the highest point in Arizona at 12,633 feet (3,851 m). The second, third, and fourth highest peaks in Arizona are found nearby. The San Francisco Peaks are the dominant structure of the San Francisco Volcanic Field, an 1,800 square mile (4,700 km) volcanic field that contains more than 600 volcanic features. The Coconino National Forest encompasses a large portion of the volcanic field and so the forest landscape around Flagstaff is dotted with tree-covered cinder cones, lava flows, and underground lava tubes (such as Lava River Cave). The Flagstaff District surrounds two United States National Monuments near Flagstaff, Walnut Canyon National Monument and Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument the latter of which preserves the youngest cinder cone in the San Francisco Volcanic Field, Sunset Crater. The forest borders another National Monument, Wupatki National Monument on its northeast corner.\n\nLocated in the southern portion of the Flagstaff District is Mormon Lake, the largest natural lake in the state of Arizona. Several other natural lakes, including Ashurst Lake and Marshall Lake, dot the top of Anderson Mesa, an approximately 20-mile (30 km) long ridge that rises 200 to 400 feet (60−120 m) above the surrounding landscape. Anderson Mesa is best known for the branch of Lowell Observatory located along the edge of the mesa. At the base of the southwest side of Anderson Mesa are two narrow, manmade reservoirs constructed in the early 1900s, Upper Lake Mary and Lower Lake Mary. Upper Lake Mary contains water year round in all but the very driest years while Lower Lake Mary, located just to the northwest of Upper Lake Mary, usually resembles a wet meadow rather than a lake.\n\nThe Red Rock district, centered on the town of Sedona, encompasses many of the famous red rock buttes and mesas, and canyons that have made Sedona famous as a resort town. Just north of Sedona is Oak Creek Canyon, one of the many large canyons located along the Mogollon Rim. Oak Creek Canyon is one of the most popular recreation destinations in the Coconino National Forest and along with Sedona is Arizona's second most popular tourist attraction, second only to the Grand Canyon. Oak Creek Canyon is also a popular leaf peeping area in the fall as it is one of the few areas in the forest where deciduous trees are the dominant vegetation type. This region is also home to Sycamore Canyon, the second largest canyon in Arizona. Elevations in this part of the forest are substantially lower (Sedona is at 4,500 feet (1,400 m) above sea level) than the rest of the forest resulting in higher temperatures year round.\n\nThe Third district is the Mogollon Rim District, located along the Mogollon Rim south of the Mormon Lake District and east of the Red Rock District. The landscape here resembles the Mormon Lake District with a number of small lakes and perennial streams scattered among a dense ponderosa pine forest. The southern boundary of the district is the edge of the Mogollon Rim where the Coconino National Forest borders the Tonto National Forest and Coconino County borders Gila County.\n\nConifers and other evergreen plants are the dominant type of vegetation in the Coconino National Forest. Due in part to the dry climate, deciduous trees are rare except for in some moist areas along creeks and streams. While the ponderosa pine is by far the most common tree species in the Coconino National Forest, vegetation type varies depending on the elevation of a certain area.\n\nAt the lowest elevations, in the extreme southwestern portion of the forest, actual trees are scarce and the landscape is dominated by various small shrubs and sagebrushes. At elevations between 4,500 feet and 6,500 feet (1,400−2,000 m), which includes the area surrounding Sedona, various species of juniper including the alligator juniper and the Utah juniper are predominant. Other common tree and shrubs of this environment, often classified as the \"juniper-pinyon woodlands\", include Arizona cypress, manzanita, and pinyon pine. Hikers often encounter Parry's agave, yuccas, and prickly pear cacti in this region as well.\n\nThe huge stands of ponderosa pine on the forest are found primarily at elevations between 6,500 feet and 8,000 feet (2,000−2,400 m). Other species scattered among this region include gambel oak, quaking aspen, and Rocky Mountain Juniper.\n\nThe highest elevations in the forest are located in the San Francisco Peaks area north of Flagstaff. Here grow large conifers such as Engelmann spruce, blue spruce, subalpine fir, corkbark fir (a variety of subalpine fir found only in isolated areas of Arizona and New Mexico), Douglas-fir, bristlecone pine, and limber pine. Isolated stands of quaking aspen, usually the first tree to regenerate following a severe wildfire, are scattered across the mountain.\n\nAbove 11,000 feet (3,400 m) is found the only alpine tundra region in Arizona. Vegetation is scarce in this region. A few small bristlecone pines are found otherwise the area is above tree line and inhabited by small grasses, lichens, and alpine wildflowers.\n\nWildfire is a major concern across the Coconino National Forest. Despite the abundance of green vegetation throughout the forest, the region is classified as a high desert. Flagstaff, located in the northern part of the forest, receives about 22 inches (560 mm) of precipitation annually—including an average annual snowfall of —while other areas of the forest receive even less. The lack of any significant rainfall during the spring and early summer combined with the high temperatures and strong winds that are commonplace during that time of year results in fire danger that is usually defined as \"very high\" or \"extreme\" during the months of May through July. The danger of a major wildfire is increased by the fact that there are a number of cities and communities surrounded by forest land. Restrictions on campfires and smoking in the forest are common during peak fire season. Occasionally, the fire danger will become so great that the forest is closed to all public entry until substantial precipitation is received to minimize the danger of a stray spark setting off a destructive wildfire.\n\nOver the past few years, the Coconino National Forest has increased its use of prescribed burns as a tool to prevent major wildfires. This strategy, along with forest thinning, has been especially widespread in areas of the forest that surround urban areas.\n\nThere are ten federally designated U.S. Wilderness Areas within or partially within the Coconino National Forest:\n\nWhen the United States acquired the territory comprising Arizona and New Mexico by treaty with Mexico in 1848, those lands not already privately owned, including Spanish and Mexican land grants, nor reserved by treaty for the various Indian tribes, became a part of the \"public domain\" and open under various laws to settlement, purchase, and use.\n\nIn 1898, President William McKinley established the San Francisco Mountain Forest Reserve, at the request of Gifford Pinchot, head of the US Division of Forestry. Local reaction was hostile—citizens of Williams, Arizona held a mass protest, and the \"Williams News\" editorialized that the reserve \"virtually destroys Coconino County.\"\n\nIn 1905, the Forest Reserves were transferred to the Department of Agriculture. Some 21 million acres (85,000 km) of public lands, almost one-eighth of the area of Arizona and New Mexico, were now to be administered by the new Forest Service.\n\nIn 1908, the Coconino National Forest was established from parts of the Tonto, Black Mesa, Grand Canyon, and entire San Francisco Mountains National Forests.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2054607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054607", "title": "Age of onset", "text": "Age of onset\n\nThe age of onset is the age at which an individual acquires, develops, or first experiences a condition or symptoms of a disease or disorder. For instance, the general age of onset for the spinal disease scoliosis is \"10-15 years old,\" meaning that most people develop scoliosis when they are of an age between ten and fifteen years. \n\nDiseases are often categorized by their ages of onset as congenital, infantile, juvenile, or adult. Missed or delayed diagnosis often occurs if a disease that is typically diagnosed in juveniles (such as asthma) is present in adults, and vice versa (such as arthritis). Depending on the disease, ages of onset may impact features such as phenotype, as is the case in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. For example, the phenotype for juvenile Huntington's disease clearly differs from adult-onset Huntington's disease and late-onset Parkinson's exhibits more severe motor and non-motor phenotypes. \n\nGerm-line mutations are often at least in part the cause of disease onset at an earlier age. Though many germ-line mutations are deleterious, the genetic lens through which they may be viewed may provide insights to treatment, possibly through genetic counseling.\n\nIn some cases, the age of onset may be the result of mutation accumulation. If this is the case, it could be helpful to consider ages of onset as a product of the hypotheses depicted in theories of aging. Even some mental health disorders, whose ages of onset have been found to be harder to define than physical illnesses may have a mutated component. The symptoms of standard mental disorders often start off non-specific. Pathological changes pertaining to disorders often become more detailed and less fickle before they can be defined in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM. The brain is a dynamic and complex system, it is constantly re-wiring itself and a major concern is what happens to the brain in earlier life that mirrors what occurs later in its psycho-pathological state. The typical onset of many mental disorders in late adolescence may reflect the critical development that happens at this time.\n\nThe rate-of-living theory of aging states that senescence occurs because individuals accumulate damage to cells and tissues during cell division. This theory is not supported because its postulates that aging rate should be correlated with metabolic rate and organisms cannot evolve longer lifespans were not supported in trials. The rate-of-living theory may not be used to draw conclusions about age of onset based on this.\n\nThere are two subsets to the evolutionary theory of aging: antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis and the mutation accumulation hypothesis.\n\nThe antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis was tested by monitoring the \"age-1\" gene in C. elegans. The \"age-1\" gene plays a role in senescence; nematodes with mutations in this gene live up to 80% longer. Mutants in the \"age-1\" gene for allele \"hx546\" seem to be otherwise normal until placed under stressful conditions. Then, the carriers of the mutant gene appear to be at disadvantage—they do not lay eggs while being starved. This evidence supports antagonistic pleiotropy as a theory of aging, and therefore as an onset cause in some cases.\n\nThe mutation accumulation hypothesis was tested by demonstrating how quickly deleterious mutations can accumulate in Musca domestica. Reed and Bryant demonstrated this by limiting the lifespan of the flies to a few days, which made late-life mutations invisible to selection since they occurred after reproduction. The lifespan of the flies was monitored by allowing them to carry out their complete lifespan every few generations, which was reported to decline substantially. Mutation accumulation is supported as a theory of aging, and therefore an onset cause in cases of diseases resulting from mutation accumulation.\n"}
{"id": "2054610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054610", "title": "QantasLink", "text": "QantasLink\n\nQantasLink is a regional brand of Australian airline Qantas and is an affiliate member of the Oneworld airline alliance. It is a major competitor to Regional Express Airlines and Virgin Australia Regional Airlines. As of September 2010 QantasLink provides 1,900 flights each week to 54 domestic locations.\n\nQantasLink's origins as a single brand for Qantas' regional airline subsidiaries go back to October 1993, when Qantas acquired Australian Airlink Pty Ltd and its fleet from parent company National Jet Systems, which up to that point had been operating flights on major regional routes for Australian Airlines. The Australian Airlink name remained and the fleet was repainted in Qantas livery, and National Jet Systems was subsequently contracted by Qantas to operate Australian Airlink aircraft.\n\nPrior to 2002, Qantas' various subsidiaries operated under their own names, eventually adopting the Australian Airlines, and later, Qantas liveries. In 2002 a common brand was created, encompassing AirLink (a franchise, operated by National Jet Systems), Sunstate Airlines, Eastern Australia Airlines, and Southern Australia Airlines; Southern Australia has since ceased operations.\n\nFor a short while, QantasLink took over some of Qantas' non-trunk routes, such as Sydney - Sunshine Coast, using Boeing 717s that were inherited after Qantas acquired Impulse Airlines. QantasLink ceased operating some of these routes after Qantas formed low-cost subsidiary Jetstar Airways, transferring the Boeing 717 aircraft and routes to the new airline. In 2005/06, eight of the 717s were returned to QantasLink following Jetstar's acquisition of Airbus A320 aircraft, to be operated in Western Australia, Northern Territory and far north Queensland by National Jet Systems.\n\nOn 31 July 2015, Network Aviation was rebranded to QantasLink. This was announced by Qantas with the unveiling of a Fokker 100 in QantasLink colours.\n\nIn January 2018, Network Aviation confirmed it would lease two Airbus A320s from Jetstar Airways for flights to and from Perth as part of the QantasLink brand.\n\nOn 20th May 2020, Qantas announced the purchase of Cobham Australia's National Jet Systems subsidiary, bringing both employees and the Boeing 717-200 fleet in-house. \n\nQantasLink flights are operated by the individual airlines that make up the group - Eastern Australia Airlines, Network Aviation and Sunstate Airlines; and also contracted carrier National Jet Systems. As of May 2019 the QantasLink fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\nAll flights use QF IATA codes, and on 5 January 2009 both Eastern and Sunstate changed from their previous individual callsigns to the common Q-Link (pronounced \"Cue-Link\").\n\nQantasLink increased capacity by replacing many of its smaller Dash 8-100 and Q200 aircraft with Q400s. QantasLink pursued this deal despite landing gear problems with Q400 aircraft by some airlines. This problem also saw a grounding of the Q400s by QantasLink, though all were deemed safe and returned to service.\n\nAs part of its further expansion, QantasLink entered the South Australian market in December 2005, with flights from Adelaide to Port Lincoln and Kangaroo Island. Interstate flights were also introduced between Kangaroo Island and Melbourne. Due to low passenger loads, these services ceased operation at the end of June 2006, however QantasLink announced a resumption of Melbourne to Kangaroo Island from December 2017 alongside opening up Adelaide to Kangaroo Island flights . On 8 December 2009, QantasLink announced that it would re-enter the Adelaide to Port Lincoln market from February 2010, using Q400 aircraft flying 23 return services a week.\n\nSince 2005, QantasLink 717 services in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and Tasmania have been contracted to Cobham Aviation (formerly National Jet Systems), using the QantasLink brand. The hubs for QantasLink under the Cobham contract are in Perth, Western Australia, Cairns, Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Sydney, New South Wales, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory and Hobart, Tasmania.\n\nQantas replaced its daily Melbourne-Launceston mainline service with a three times daily QantasLink Dash 8 service from 1 August 2006. This has now been increased to a four times daily service, supplemented in peak service periods by QantasLink 717 services.\n\nIn May 2008, QantasLink announced that it would order nine 717s. Tamworth would be the first New South Wales regional airport to be serviced by the Q400, commencing in mid-August 2008.\n\nOn 29 March 2010 QantasLink and the Qantas Group announced that it would start the first international QantasLink route, from Cairns to Port Moresby, utilising Q400 aircraft already based in Cairns. The service commenced in July 2010. A QantasLink spokesperson stated that \"the airline would not turn into a fully fledged international airline, but could operate international routes in the future\".\n\nOn 18 December 2014, QantasLink announced that it would add Whyalla, South Australia, to its network, with double daily flights to commence on 13 April 2015. The route is serviced by the 50-seat Q300. In July 2015, Network Aviation was absorbed into the Qantas Link brand. In November 2014, QantasLink became the first airline to fly to the newly opened Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, establishing direct Q400 services to Sydney. In February 2016 as a result of strong demand, QantasLink increased weekly services by two flights to fifteen weekly returns. \n\nAlliance Airlines delivered the first of three additional Fokker 100s in July 2016, with two more to be delivered by the end of the year.\n\nQantasLink previously operated the following types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. QantasLink flights operated by National Jet Systems (Cobham Aviation Services Australia) use the call-sign \"QJET\", with the ICAO code QJE. All flights continue to operate under the IATA code QF.\n\n2. QantasLink flights operated by Network Aviation do not use an ICAO code and utilise the aircraft registration as a callsign.\n\n"}
{"id": "2054624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054624", "title": "Rick Reuschel", "text": "Rick Reuschel\n\nRicky Eugene Reuschel (, born May 16, 1949) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from 1972 to 1991, winning 214 games with a career 3.37 ERA. His nickname was \"Big Daddy\" because of his portly physique. He was known for his deceptive style of pitching, which kept hitters off balance by constantly varying the speeds of his pitches.\n\nReuschel was listed as 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds. Reuschel could run surprisingly well for his size (logging 4 triples in his batting career) and he was frequently used as a pinch runner on days he was not pitching. He was also a fair—though awkward-looking—hitter, batting well over .200 several times. His older brother Paul Reuschel also pitched for the Cubs from 1975-1978, as Rick's teammate. Paul's career ended with the Cleveland Indians in 1979. The Reuschel brothers were Illinois farm boys, with strong physiques and plain-spoken ways. The two are the only siblings to combine on a shutout. On August 21, 1975, Rick started and went 6⅓ innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers, followed by Paul, who pitched the final 2⅔ innings for the Cubs' 7–0 win.\n\nReuschel attended Central High School in Camp Point, Illinois. After high school he played at Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois. Rueschel was the Cubs 3rd Round pick (#67) in the 1970 Amateur Draft out of Western Illinois, after he went 10-0 with a 1.29 ERA as a junior in 1969.\n\nIn 1970, Reuschel went 9-2 with a 3.53 ERA in 14 starts for the Class A Huron Cubs of the Northern League. In 1971, Reuschel went 8-4 with a 2.31 ERA in 16 starts for the Class AA San Antonio Missions of the Dixie Association, where he was teammates with his older brother, pitcher Paul Reuschel.\n\nWith the Class AAA Wichita Aeros of the American Association, Reuschel was 9-2 in 12 starts with a 1.32 ERA, before being called up by the Chicago Cubs to make his major league debut on June 19, 1972.\n\nReuschel began his Major League Baseball career when he was drafted in the third round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft by the Chicago Cubs, at a time when they were declining in the post-Durocher era, and provided a strong arm for the Cubs' increasingly mediocre staff. After spending two years in the minor leagues, he joined the Cubs' major league team in 1972. His best season was in 1977, when the Cubs made a brief run at the pennant. Reuschel won 20 games and finished third in the Cy Young Award voting behind Steve Carlton and Tommy John. In addition, Reuschel pitched in a memorable game for Cub fans on July 28, 1977, when making a rare relief appearance on two days' rest, he entered the 13th inning of a 15–15 tie between the Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds at Wrigley Field. Reuschel retired two batters to end the top of the 13th. Then, he singled and scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the 13th, also picking up the victory in the 16–15 contest.\n\nReuschel was traded to the New York Yankees in 1981. Reuschel was 4-4 with a 2.67 ERA in 11 starts with the Yankees, pitched 6 innings, giving up 2 runs against the Milwukee Brewers in the AL Divisional Series and made his first World Series appearances, with a 4.91 ERA in 2 world series games. The 1981 World Series marked the last chapter of the Dodgers-Yankees trilogy of that era, this one won by the Dodgers. Reuschel was ineffective in that Series, and it appeared his career might be finished.\n\nReuschel did not pitch in 1982 due to a rotator-cuff injury. He returned to the Cubs and went 6-6 combined in 1983 and 1984, spending a good portion of 1983 rehabbing in the minor leagues.\n\nHe returned to the Cubs and was on the roster in 1984 when they won the National League Eastern Division and made the playoffs, but, somewhat controversially, he was not named to the playoff roster.\n\nIn twelve total seasons with the Cubs, Reuschel was 135-127 with a 3.50 ERA in 388 games, with 343 starts with 65 complete games.\n\nReuschel was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1985 as a free agent, and had a 14–8 win-loss record with the last-place Pirates, earning him the National League's Comeback Player of the Year award. \n\nReuschel was 31-30 with a 3.04 ERA in 91 games with the Pirates.\n\nThe Pirates traded Reuschel to the San Francisco Giants in late 1987 for Jeff Robinson and Scott Medvin. \n\nReuschel, finally back with a contender, became the ace of the Giants' staff and helped them make a late run to the National League Western Division title, their first division title since 1971. He followed that season by winning 19 games for the Giants in 1988. \n\nIn 1989 at the age of 40, Reuschel was selected as the starting pitcher for the National League in the 1989 All-Star Game, and gave up a lead off home run to Bo Jackson, followed by Wade Boggs' home run to start the game. Reuschel finished the 1989 season with 17 wins for the Giants as he helped lead them to the World Series (their first since 1962). In the 1989 World Series, Reuschel was the losing pitcher in Game 2 with an 11.25 ERA, five earned runs, and five hits given up against the Oakland Athletics.\n\nWith the Giants, Reuschel was 44-30 with a 3.29 ERA in 96 games.\n\nReuschel is one of only two pitchers in MLB history (along with Frank Tanana) to give up a home run to both Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds.\n\nIn a nineteen-year major league career, Reuschel compiled a record of 214–191 in 557 games (529 starts). He had 102 career complete games and 26 of those were shutouts. He allowed 1,330 earned runs and 2,015 strikeouts in 3,548 and 1/3 innings pitched. \n\nReuschel was a two-time Gold Glove Award winner and a three-time All-Star. Reuschel is tied for 90th with Mark Buehrle on the all-time wins list. Reuschel won the Hutch Award in 1985, and was also a winner of Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award. Reuschel was named to the Baseball Digest 1972 Rookie All-Star team.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After graduating from the academy in February 1895, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the cavalry in May. He was promoted to lieutenant in October 1897 and to captain in November 1900. \n\nMinami served in the Russo-Japanese War as a member of the headquarters staff and as a company commander in the 1st Cavalry Regiment, where he participated in the Siege of Port Arthur. He was promoted to major in March 1905 and to lieutenant colonel in February 1910. Promoted to colonel in August 1915, he commanded the IJA 13th Cavalry Regiment during World War I, from 1914-1917. Minami was Chief of the Cavalry Section of the Ministry of War from 1917-1919.\n\nAttaining the rank of major general in July 1919, Minami served as commander of the IJA 3rd Cavalry Brigade in 1921–1923, then as Commandant of the Cavalry School in 1922–1923, and returned to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy as its commandant in 1923-1924. \n\nMinami was promoted to lieutenant general in February 1924, and commanded the IJA 16th Division from 1926 to 1927. After serving as Vice Chief Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from 1927 to 1929, he became Commander-in-Chief of the Chosen Army from 1929 to 1930. He was promoted to full general in March 1930.\n\nReturning to Japan, Minami was appointed Minister of War in the Wakatsuki Cabinet in 1931. As War Minister, his role dispatched Major General Yoshitsugu Tatekawa to Manchuria specifically to curb the militarist behaviors of the Kwantung Army, but the Mukden Incident took place to worsen Sino-Japanese relations before Tatekawa could act. Minami was War Minister during the Imperial Colors Incident.\n\nMinami served as a member of the Supreme War Council from 1931 to 1934. He then received a posting as Commander of the Kwangtung Army from 1934 to 1936, during which time he was concurrently Japanese ambassador to Manchukuo. \n\nMinami was placed on the reserve list in 1936, after the February 26 Incident, and forced into retirement from active service.\n\nHowever, in 1936, Minami was appointed 8th Governor-General of Korea between 1936 and 1942. His tenure in Korea was marked by a more hard-line approach than his predecessors, with a rolling back of various liberal reforms of the 1920s. In addition, Minami outlawed all but one of the Korean language newspapers, and strongly pushed for the \"soshi-kamei\" policy.\n\nAfter his term in Korea, Minami served as a member of the Privy Council from 1942 to 1945, and had a seat in the House of Peers in the Japanese Diet in 1945.\nAfter World War II, Minami was arrested by the American Occupation authorities and brought before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He was convicted only of Counts 1 and 27: i.e. of being a leader in the plan to wage an unprovoked war of aggression against China, largely since he was Minister of War at the time of the Manchurian Incident. However he was acquitted of waging a war of aggression against the United States, the British Commonwealth and the Netherlands, and also acquitted of two charges related to prisoner abuse. He was sentenced to life in prison but was paroled in 1954 on the grounds of his health. He died a year later.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2054639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054639", "title": "Shirley Kwan", "text": "Shirley Kwan\n\nShirley Kwan, Kwan Suk'E, or Kwan Suk Yee (, born 15 August 1966) is an influential Cantopop singer from Hong Kong. Kwan first shot to fame in 1989 with the hit, \"Happy Are Those in Love\" () and was widely popular throughout the early to mid-90s. She is noted for her distinct, whispery vocal style and known equally for singing mainstream ballads and more alternative songs.\n\nKwan was born in Hong Kong and moved to Los Angeles at the age of twelve. She studied fashion before venturing into the entertainment industry in 1986, at the age of 20.\n\nKwan had her first taste of the limelight in 1986 when she became one of twelve finalists in TVB's New Talent Singing Awards, along with Andy Hui and Leon Lai, but lost to both. Two years later, with the encouragement of a friend, she recorded a demo tape for the prestigious \"Marine Blue\" singing competition in Japan and won. She caught the eyes of record executives at Apollon and signed a contract, releasing two Japanese pop albums in two years. Kwan sang in both Japanese and English for these releases, and notably made her first and only rap vocals in the song \"Borderless\".\n\nKwan's Marine Blue success in Japan quickly led to her discovery by PolyGram. In 1 March 1989, Kwan released her debut Cantonese album \"Winter Love\" (), with its R&B-influenced first single, \"The Rebel\" ().\n\nHer second album, \"Happy Are those in Love\", would produce her first major hit with its title track, which immediately propelled Kwan into Hong Kong stardom. The song \"Happy are Those in Love\" was the theme song to a popular day-time drama series on TVB. It reached no. 1 on the TVB charts and was frequently requested in karaoke bars at the time. The album, which sold platinum, enjoyed huge chart success and spawned a further hit single, the up-tempo \"Lovers Underneath the Stars\" (), with Kwan sweeping newcomer awards at all of the major year-end music award shows.\n\nThe following two years saw the release of four albums, in which Kwan started to develop a more individualistic style. After scoring another major pop hit in 1990 with 愛恨纏綿, Kwan began incorporating elements from a wider variety of musical genres. Her 1991 album \"Love is Forever\" () saw her exploring New Age music, with cover versions of songs by Gregorian and Michael Cretu. As a marketing strategy, PolyGram presented its title track, which was a cover version of \"Once in a Life Time,\" back to back with the Gregorian original on the promotional disc that was sent out to radio DJs at the time. Kwan also covered Amina's 1991 winning Eurovision entry, \"Le dernier qui a parle\", rewritten by veteran lyricist Andrew Lam () as \"Buddhist Chant\" (), which became a surprising top 10 radio single.\n\nIn 18 November 1993, Kwan released the platinum-selling album, \"The Story of Shirley\" (), which spawned the minor hit \"Fake Love\" (). The album signalled a change in vocal style, with a whispery delivery that featured more prominently than before, and which would become her trademark style.\n\nKwan further established her place as a cantopop diva with the album, \"My Way\", released in 8 July 1994. This would be the last album containing all original Cantonese material until \"Shirley's Era\" in 2009. Singles included the acid-jazz influenced \"Death of a Legend\" () which sampled a riff from the Digable Planets' 1993 single \"Rebirth of Slick,\" and the immensely popular ballad \"Cuddling Underneath the Stars\" (), another of Kwan's major career hits, which won numerous song awards at the ceremonies that year. The album also featured two of Andrew Lam's techno and house inflected compositions \"Anxiety\" () and \"Out of This World\" (), as well as another popular ballad \"Farewell Love Song\" (). \"My Way\", the cover of which featured Kwan in a new crew-cut look that has since become iconic, was one of the most celebrated in 1994, enjoying a high-degree of both commercial and critical success.\n\nWith increasing confidence in her musical style, Kwan asked producer Joseph Ip () and eight different sound engineers to rearrange ten of her favourite cantopop songs which she handpicked for a covers album. The result was \"'EX' All Time Favourites,\" released in February 1995, which featured covers of classics by Anita Mui, Leslie Cheung and Alan Tam, reworked and reinterpreted with Kwan's alternative musical influences and trademark, ethereal singing style. The lead single, a cover version of Teresa Teng's \"Forget Him\" rearranged by Donald Ashley, was featured in Wong Kar-wai's 1995 arthouse film \"Fallen Angels\". The album sold three times platinum, and was selected in 2000 as one of the Top 20 Defining Chinese Albums of All Time for the book (聽見2000分之100) by a jury of musicians which included Anthony Wong, Sandee Chan, Carl Wong and Lin Wei-Che.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, Kwan released her third compilation album, \"Journey of Life\" (世途上　新曲＋精選), containing two new singles, \"He Needs You, She Needs You\" (), a dreampop track which incorporated the traditional Chinese instrument \"erhu\", and the minor hit, \"Are There Real Friends in Life\" (), a pop ballad which has since became a fan favourite.\n\nRiding on the success of a string of platinum-selling albums, Kwan held her first large-scale solo concert series, \"The One and Only Shirley Kwan in Concert\" (), in June 1995 at the Hong Kong Coliseum.\n\nAfter seven years at PolyGram, Kwan's contract came to an end in June 1996. A final PolyGram studio album was initially scheduled for release in the summer, containing three American collaborations (\"Infectious\" [傳染] and \"Elusive Love\" [愛難尋] written by Andy Goldmark; and \"Mumbling\" [自言自語] by Suzanne Fountain) and seven other tracks. However, due to Kwan's departure, PolyGram released the material separately in 1997's compilation \"Connection\" () and 1998's EP \"eZone\".\n\nKwan spent the second half of the 90s mostly away from the public eye, but managed to strike up some significant collaborations with friends and fellow contemporaries Tats Lau and Anthony Wong Yiu Ming of the former Tat Ming Pair. The first of these included \"Blessed Mary\" (), a duet with Wong satirising Hong Kong's materialism released in late 1995. This was followed by the Tats Lau collaboration \"Cuddle 28800BPS\" (繾綣28800BPS), a song dealing with cyber love, and a cover version of the gender-ambiguous Tat Ming classic \"Forget He is She\" () at their request, both in 1996. In 1997, Kwan lent her vocals to the theme song of a radio drama produced by Commercial Radio Hong Kong, \"Take Me Out Dancing\" () which featured a soprano backing vocal mixed with a thumping dance beat. In 1999, she held a \"Music Is Live\" concert organized by Commercial Radio.\n\nAfter several years of inactivity, Kwan attempted a short comeback in 2001, signing a contract reportedly worth 8-million dollars with BMG Taiwan in a high-profile press conference. Working with well-known producers such as Anthony Bao (), Jamie Hsueh (), and Benjamin Lin (), she released one Mandarin album, \"Freezing Flame\" () in November, to critical acclaim. The album spawned two singles, \"Freezing Flame\" () and \"Who\" () which featured a mix of string instruments and electronic elements. Although the initial contract was for 4 albums, this came to a halt in 2002, when Kwan had become pregnant and moved to Canada. It was in an interview with \"Mingpao\" in 2013, in which she revealed that BMG had not arranged for any recording sessions for more than a year after she gave birth, and this ultimately led to an early termination.\n\nIn 2003, she was requested by Eason Chan to record guest vocals for the track \"Lies\" () on his album \"Live for Today\".\n\nIn fall 2005, Kwan stepped into the recording studio once again and duet with music veteran Alan Tam in \"Rekindle The Flame\" (), a Cantonese remake of the French ballad \"J'ai murmure va-t-en\". The news of Kwan making a comeback sent excitement through Hong Kong's airwaves, and \"Rekindle\" took the charts by storm, reaching number 1 on TVB, RTHK and Metro Radio.\n\nTwo months later, Kwan was signed to a contract with Music Nation Group () by the famous producer, Frankie Lee Chun. The first single \"About Me\" () saw Kwan reunited with lyrist Wyman Wong and long-time collaborators Joseph Ip and John Laudon. Supported by extensive airplay, \"About Me\" steadily climbed to the top of various radio charts, and its limited-release special edition CD sold out within a day.\n\nIn early February 2006, the eponymous EP \"Shirley Kwan\" was released, introducing the second brand new single, \"Evolution\" (). This coincided with the release of a 3CD-Karaoke plus DVD compilation by Universal Music (formally PolyGram), entitled \"All About Shirley,\" which contained side projects and rare tracks dating back to the very beginning of her career in Japan.\n\nTo much anticipation, three comeback concerts, \"Being Shirley On Stage\" () were held in late February, at the legendary Hong Kong Coliseum. Performing her biggest hits in reverse chronological order, Kwan garnered positive reviews for the performance, which dominated entertainment headlines for a week. In the final encore, Kwan famously covered Eason Chan's \"Today Next Year\" () to a standing ovation, and a sing-a-long audience of 30, 000.\n\nUpon completion of her contract with Music Nation, Kwan released two new songs in February 2007 as an independent artist for songwriter Keith Chan ()'s multimedia musical \"12 faces of woman\" () at the 2007 Hong Kong Arts Festival. This included the theme song \"All Living Flowers\" (), which featured a mix of traditional Chinese and Western string instruments and a duet with Lee Heung Kam, \"3000 Years Ago\" () which won the CASH Golden Sail Music Award for Best Alternative Song. In March, she released the single \"Just Once\" (), which was the theme song to a primetime TVB sitcom series and reached no. 1 on the TVB singles chart.\n\nIn June 2007, longtime friend and veteran producer Herman Ho () recruited Shirley to his new company \"Star Entertainment Ltd.\" (), which is financed by Neway Karaoke Box (Neway卡拉OK).\n\n2008 saw the release of two new singles, \"Mountain, River\" () and (), followed by a new concert series, \"Unexpected Shirley Kwan in Concert,\" which was held at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 24–25 April 2008.\n\nOn 15 June 2009, Kwan released the long-anticipated studio album, \"Shirley's Era\", which contains all singles released in 2007–2008 as well as newly recorded material. This marked her first, full-length Cantonese studio album since 1994's All Time Favourites. The album produced the new single, \"The Ends of the Earth\" () which reached no. 1 on the 903 Commercial Radio charts.\n\nIn October 2010, Kwan performed a live concert \"One Starry Night: An Evening with Shirley Kwan\" at the Venetian Arena in Macau, which featured mostly live covers of songs by other artists, such as Alan Tam's \"Illusion\" (), Aaron Kwok's \"Why did I let you go?\" () and Faye Wong's \"I'm Willing\" (). She returned to the same stage on 12 November 2011 with long-time friend and collaborator Anthony Wong for the concert, \"Anthony Wong x Shirley Kwan: Forget He is She Concert, Macau 2011.\"\n\nIn 2012, Kwan collaborated with Juno Mak on the single \"Clavicle\" (), which offers a mature example of her dream pop vocals and reached no. 1 on the Commercial Radio charts. In late 2012, she released the limited edition single, \"Tourbillon\" (), a cover of an Eason Chan song to polarizing reviews, but which was lauded by both the lyricist Wyman Wong and Anthony Wong for her authorial style.\n\nOn 2 February 2013, she held her 4th concert series at the Hong Kong Coliseum, \"Philip Stein Your Favorite Shirley Kwan Suk'E In Concert,\" for two consecutive evenings. Later that year, she took part in a series of concerts, \"Polygram Forever\" for the newly revived label and recorded the theme song, \"Coincidence\" () for the TVB series \"Always and Ever\" ().\n\nIn 2014, she recorded a duet with Mag Lam () as the theme song to the TVB series \"Never Dance Alone\" ().\n\nIn 2016, Kwan held a concert celebrating her 25th anniversary in the music industry, \"The Best of Shirley Kwan 25 Live,\" at the Hong Kong Coliseum to rave reviews. Kwan dedicated the performance to her late mother, and broke down during her performance of the Hins Cheung cover, \"Stay Young Forever\" (), prompting a memorable audience sing-along.\n\nOn 9 April 2017, she performed as a musical guest at the 36th Hong Kong Film awards amidst controversy of her recent arrest for intimidation and common assault. She performed a medley of theme songs including \"Invincible\" () and \"Let Me Stay by Your Side\" () backed by Hanjin Tan, Supper Moment and The Interzone Collective, as well as presented the awards for Best Original Film Song and Best Original Score.\n\nIn 2018, Kwan signed on with Universal Music Group. However, the working relationship between the company and Kwan was rocky, and Kwan announced that she would retire from the entertainment industry after having fulfilled her contract.\n\n\n\n\nIn early 1997, Kwan was asked by Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai to star in his film \"Happy Together\". She was flown to Argentina in five days' notice and ended up spending more than two months filming. Starring opposite Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Chang Chen, Kwan played Leung's mysterious and lonely secret admirer and also recorded a cover of Caetano Veloso's \"Cucurucucu Paloma\" (Song of Dove) for the film's soundtrack. However, her scenes were all deleted from the final version of the film, for which Wong later went on to win Best Director at the Cannes. It took another three years for Kwan's scenes to surface, when they were included in the making-of documentary, \"Buenos Aires Zero Degrees\" (). The documentary premiered at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival out of competition, and was also shown at the 2000 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards in Taiwan.\n\nKwan is a single mother and gave birth to her son in January 2002 in Canada. For a long time, Kwan has not disclosed the true paternity of her child and insisted only that they had met in Canada, and is not someone in the entertainment business. Kwan broke her silence on the matter in 2014 when she posted a photo of Zuri Rinpoche 8th, a Bhutanese religious teacher, on her Instagram, with a caption saying he is the true father of her child.\n\nIn the past, Kwan has been romantically linked to Michael Chow (1992–96), and Hacken Lee.\n\nIn September 2012, Kwan posted a suicidal message on facebook. She was incommunicado for roughly thirty-six hours before contacting her younger sister to confirm her safety.\n\nIn October 2016, Kwan was rescued from the waters off Kensington Beach. She was walking along the shore with a female friend, who had reportedly told officers that she was unhappy from work and had walked down to the sea for a swim.\n\nIn May 2017, Kwan was charged with one count of intimidation and one count of common assault for an altercation that took place with a Kensington Beach Hotel restaurant staff earlier in March.\n\n\n"}

Aegirine is the sodium endmember of the aegirine-augite series. Aegirine has the chemical formula NaFeSiO in which the iron is present as Fe. In the aegirine-augite series the sodium is variably replaced by calcium with iron(II) and magnesium replacing the iron(III) to balance the charge. Aluminium also substitutes for the iron(III). Acmite is a fibrous, green-colored variety.\n\nAegirine occurs as dark green monoclinic prismatic crystals. It has a glassy luster and perfect cleavage. Its Mohs hardness varies from 5 to 6, and its specific gravity is between 3.2 and 3.4.\n\nThis mineral commonly occurs in alkalic igneous rocks, nepheline syenites, carbonatites and pegmatites. It also appears in regionally\nmetamorphosed schists, gneisses, and iron formations; in blueschist facies rocks, and from sodium metasomatism in granulites. It may occur as an authigenic mineral in shales and marls.

At the 2001 election, however, the CLP member for Jingili, Steve Balch, was defeated by Labor Party challenger Dr Chris Burns. Burns' victory was part of an unexpected Labor wave that swept through Darwin, allowing Labor to win government in the Territory for the first time. The area's CLP voting history led many commentators to suggest that it was likely to revert to the CLP at the 2005 election. As it turned out, Burns was re-elected easily amid that year's Labor landslide, with a substantially increased majority—although not as much as in similar electorates nearby. Burns retired at the 2012 election, and the seat was retained for Labor by former cricketer Ken Vowles with only a small swing against Labor. Vowles consolidated his hold on the seat amid Labor's massive landslide in 2016.

He previously held the seat from 1999 to 2014 as a member of the Country Liberal Party (CLP).\n\nPalmerston has always been a staunchly conservative area, and all the electorates in the city have almost always been held by the Country Liberal Party. Blain has even amongst the Palmerston electorates been in the past a particularly safe seat for the CLP, with successive members having little trouble being re-elected. This was further emphasised at the 2005 election, when Blain was one of only four CLP-held seats retained by the party after a landslide victory by the Labor Party, and the only CLP seat in the Darwin/Palmerston area.\n\nLongtime CLP MP Barry Coulter, who had represented Palmerston-area electorates since 1983 (Berrimah from 1983 to 1987 and Palmerston from 1987 to 1997) held this seat for the final term of his parliamentary career.

Goyder encompasses large rural areas south of Darwin, covering 38,119 km², and taking in the towns of Bees Creek, Cox Peninsula, Virginia, Marlows Lagoon and parts of Berry Springs and Humpty Doo. When first created, it was even larger extending south to Pine Creek and east to Jabiru and the whole of Kakadu National Park. There were 5,587 people enrolled in the electorate as of August 2016.\n\nGoyder was considered a staunch conservative electorate and a very safe seat for the Country Liberal Party for most of its history. It was created in 1990, and the endorsed CLP candidate, Terry McCarthy, defeated renegade former leader Ian Tuxworth to become the first member. McCarthy was handily reelected twice, serving two stints as Speaker. He retired in 2001, and Peter Maley easily retained the seat for the CLP.\n\nHowever, in 2005, a string of factors caused a massive swing to the Labor Party—sparking memories of what had happened in the safe ALP seat of MacDonnell in 1997. In May, barely over a month before the election, the CLP expelled Maley over disagreements and a later dropped domestic violence order. While he decided not to run as an independent, he harshly criticised the CLP and urged his supporters to vote for Labor. In addition, prominent Litchfield Shire President Mary Walshe ran as an independent, and while she did not poll anywhere well as she had hoped, she directed her preferences to Labor candidate Ted Warren. The campaign of the CLP candidate, Keith Phasey, was further harmed when the media reported that his wife had been questioned by a Western Australian inquiry into the deaths of several cancer patients, leading to a police raid on the home eight days before the election, although the police had been careful to distance Phasey himself from the investigation. Finally, this came against the backdrop of a very large swing to the ALP across the Territory, which also resulted in Opposition Leader Denis Burke losing his very safe seat of Brennan.\n\nIn the end, the combination of factors saw the previously very safe CLP seat delivered to the ALP, with Warren narrowly defeating Phasey and becoming the first ALP member in the electorate's history. The final result was not known for several days after the election. However, a redistribution ahead of the 2008 election made the seat notionally CLP, and the seat reverted to form when Warren was soundly defeated by Kezia Purick of the CLP. Purick consolidated the CLP hold on the seat in 2012, and was elected as Speaker. She left the CLP to become an independent in July 2015, and easily retained the seat as an independent in 2016.\n\n"}

However, there was a significant swing to the ALP across the territory on election day, and Dunham was ultimately defeated, along with several other CLP sitting members. The final result took several days to be decided, but ultimately Natt won the seat on a swing of 17.5 percent. Even more surprisingly, he won enough primary votes to take the seat without the need for preferences. However, before the 2008 election, a redistribution erased Natt's majority and made Drysdale a notional CLP seat. Ross Bohlin regained the seat for the CLP on a large swing, but lost his preselection in 2012 and contested the election as an independent candidate. He was defeated by the CLP's endorsed candidate, Lia Finocchiaro.\n\nAfter a redistribution transferred much of Finocchiaro's base to the new seat of Spillett, Finocchiaro opted to transfer to Spillett even though Drysdale was still a safe CLP seat on paper.

The jar's mouth has a screw thread on its outer perimeter to accept a metal ring (or \"band\"). The band, when screwed down, presses a separate stamped tin-plated steel disc-shaped lid against the jar's rim. An integral rubber ring on the underside of the lid creates a hermetic seal. The bands and lids usually come with new jars, but they are also sold separately. While the bands are reusable, the lids are intended for single-use when canning. Largely supplanted by other products and methods for commercial canning, such as tin cans and plastic containers, glass jars and metal lids are still commonly used in home canning.\n\nMason jars are also called:\n\nLightning fruit jars, another type of Mason jar, were not as common as the screw-thread version, but they were popular for home canning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nIn the United States, standard-size Mason jars are made of soda-lime glass and come in two sizes: regular mouth, inner and outer diameter, and wide mouth, inner and outer diameter, versions. They are also produced in a variety of volumes, including cup (half-pint), pint, quart, and half-gallon.\n\nAmong the most common U.S. brands of Mason jars are Ball, Kerr, and Golden Harvest. Jarden Corporation, based in Boca Raton, Florida, retains the license to use the Ball and Kerr registered trademarks on home-canning products as a part of its branded consumables business. At one time, Jarden also may have had a license to use the Golden Harvest brand; however, Jarden’s website did not list Golden Harvest as one of its brands as of March 2016. In Canada, Bernardin, which is another division of Jarden, is the most common brand; Golden Harvest is also available. Jarden offers its Canadian jars in metric volumes of 125ml, 250ml, 500ml and 1 litre.\n\nIt appears that the development of the mason jar was as follows.\n\n\nIn home canning, food is packed into the mason jar, leaving some empty \"head space\" between the level of food and the top of the jar. The lid is placed on top of the jar with the integral rubber seal resting on the rim. A band is screwed loosely over the lid, allowing air and steam to escape. The jar is heat sterilized in boiling water or steam and the lid is secured. The jar is then allowed to cool to room temperature.\n\nThe cooling of the contents creates a vacuum in the head space, pulling the lid into tight contact with the jar rim to create a hermetic seal. Once cooled, the band is removed to prevent residual water between the jar threads and the lid from rusting the band. If the jar seal is properly formed, internal vacuum will keep the lid tightly on the jar. Most metal lids used today are slightly domed to serve as a seal status indicator. The vacuum in a properly sealed mason jar pulls the lid down to create a concave-shaped dome. An improper or failed seal or microbial growth will cause the dome to pop upward.\n\nFrench chef Nicolas Appert invented the method of preserving food by enclosing it in sealed containers. Among the earliest glass jars used for home canning were wax sealers, named in reference to the sealing wax that was poured into a channel around the lip to secure a tin lid. This process, which was complicated and error-prone, became popular in the late 1830s or early 1840s and was commonly used to seal fruit jars from the early 1850s until about 1890. The wax sealing process was largely the only one available until other sealing methods were developed, and widely used into the early 1900s.\nBy far the most popular and longest used form of closure for the glass canning jar was a zinc screw-on cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. It usually had a milk-glass liner, but some of the earliest lids may have had transparent glass liners. In 1858, a Vineland tinsmith named John Landis Mason (1832–1902) invented and patented a screw finish glass jar or bottle that became known as the Mason jar (U.S. Patent No. 22,186.) From 1857, when it was first patented, to the present, Mason jars have had hundreds of variations in shape and cap design. After it was discovered that Mason's patent had expired, many other manufacturers produced glass jars for home canning using the Mason-style jar. \"Patent Nov 30th 1858,\" signifying the date of Mason's patent, was embossed on thousands of jars, which were made in many shapes, sizes, and colors well into the 1900s. Since they were made in such quantity and used for such long periods, many of them have survived to the present day.\n\nBetween 1860 and 1900, many other patents were issued for Mason jar improvements and closures. The more esoteric closures were quickly abandoned, and thus can fetch high prices in today's antique market. Mason applied for and received a United States trademark, which was registered on May 23, 1871, as U.S. Trademark no. 276. Letters of patent issued to Mason on May 10, 1870, for improvements to his fruit-canning jar was determined to be invalid as a result of a patent infringement case brought before the Southern District of New York on June 11, 1874. The court acknowledged that Mason had invented the jar in 1859, but he did not apply for a patent for an improved version of the fruit jar until 1868. In the meantime, several others had patented designs and Mason had known these jars were being produced and sold. The court ruled that Mason's delay in protecting his patent indicated he had abandoned his invention in the intervening years between 1859 and 1868 and had forfeited his patent. The court's decision allowed other manufacturers to patent, produce, and sell glass jars for canning.\n\nOne of the more popular styles of closures for the Mason jar was the wire bail. The closure consists of a metal wire arrangement with a lever that applies leverage to a glass lid when pivoted downward against the side of the jar, clamping it down over a separate rubber O ring. The bail-style jars are still widely used in Western Europe, particularly France and Italy, where the two largest manufacturers (France's Le Parfait and Italy's Bormioli Rocco) produce the Le Parfait and Fido brands, respectively. While bail-type jars are widely available in the United States, they are generally marketed there exclusively for dry storage and only rarely used for home canning.\n\nOn January 5, 1875, Charles de Quillfeldt of New York City invented a wire-bail closure known as the Lightning closure. Within a short time he sold the patent rights to several individuals, including Henry Putnam and Karl Hutter. The stopper or lid was typically made from metal, porcelain, or ceramic, while a rubber gasket was used to seal the container. Putnam modified de Quillfeldt's design so that the lid was secured by centering the wire bail between two raised dots or in a groove along the lid's center. Putnam's closure was patented 1882 (U.S. Patent #256,857).\n\nDe Quillfeldt used the term \"Lightning\" to refer to the sealing method, but the closure's popular use on fruit jars led to the name, Lightning fruit jar. The sealing surface on the jar was a \"shelf\" that supported the lower edge of the lid. A rubber gasket between the shelf and the bottom surface of the lid formed a secure seal when the wire closure was tightened. Although Lightning jars were popular for home canning use from the early 1880s to the early 1900s, they were not as common as screw-thread Mason jars. The first U.S.-made brand of jars to use this type of closure was embossed with \"Lightning\" on the side.\n\nA new type of Mason jar known as a \"bead\" jar was introduced around 1910 to 1915. These continuous screw-thread jars were designed with a bead between the screw threads and the shoulder as a sealing surface. The Ball Perfect Mason jar, one of the most common jars of this style, was introduced around 1913 and produced until the mid-twentieth century. It had several variations, including a square-shaped jar. During the twentieth century, bead jars were sealed with two-piece metal lids. The jar lid had a rubber or rubber-like sealing surface and was held in place by a separate metal band. This type of jar and closure, which first became popular in the late 1910s and 1920s, is still in use.\n\nThe decline in Mason jar manufacturing in North America is due to several factors: the lack of U.S.-based manufacturers of bail-closure jars since the early 1960s, a sharp decline in popularity of home canning in the 1950s and 1960s, consolidation of the U.S. canning jar industry, and the resulting higher cost of imported European-made jars. The Ball Corporation, which once dominated the market as the largest domestic manufacturer of home-canning jars, spun off its home-canning business in 1993.\n\nOlder styles of home canning jars are \"Not Recommended\" by the U.S.-based National Center for Home Food Preservation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and University Extension Services. These include: (A) those using a zinc cap and a rubber jar ring, and (B) those using a glass lid, wire bail, and rubber sealing ring. These provide \"no definitive way to determine if a vacuum seal is formed.\"\n\nOn August 15, 2017, the Registrar at National Day Calendar proclaimed National Mason Jar Day to be observed annually as a National Holiday on November 30th, beginning in 2017. This holiday was created by Unboxing the Bizarre. \n\nAntique canning jars are often sold through antique stores and auction sites such as eBay. The value of a jar is related to its age, rarity, color, and condition. A jar's age and rarity can be determined by the color, shape, mold and production marks of the glass, and the jar's closure. Mason jars usually have a proprietary brand embossed on the jar. Early jars embossed with \"Mason's Patent November 28th 1858\" that date from the late 1850s to early 1860s closely match the illustrations of Mason's 1858 patents. Mouth-blown (or hand-blown) jars embossed with a version of \"Mason's Patent November 28th 1858\" were made about 1857 to 1908 and often had a ground lip as well. By 1908 semi-automatic machines manufactured the majority of these jars. Machine-made Mason jars that originated around 1909 have a sealing surface on a bead ledge below the threads. This type of jar dominated the market by the mid to late 1910s. Manufacturers continued to make jars with the beaded seal after the mid-twentieth century. Ball's \"Ideal\" canning jar, which first appeared around 1915 and was discontinued in 1962, is one of the company's best-known jars and is popular among collectors.\n\nColored jars were considered better for canning because the color blocked some light from reaching the food, which helps to retain flavor and nutritional value longer. Most antique jars that are not colorless are aqua or \"Ball blue,\" a blue-green shade that was named for the Ball Corporation, a prevalent jar manufacturer. Most mouth-blown Mason jars embossed with some type of 1858 patent date were produced in aqua glass. The Ball brand of Mason jars were manufactured in several colors, but the most common color was the distinctive \"Ball blue,\" which the Ball Corporation used in its jars from about 1910 to 1930. Mason jars with this particular color of glass may be attributed to Ball, since \"virtually no other bottle or jar was made in that color.\" More rarely, jars will turn up in amber, and occasionally in darker shades of green. Rarer still are cobalt blue, black, and milk-glass jars. Some unscrupulous dealers will irradiate jars to bring out colors not original to the jar.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In his 17-year MLB career, he was an All-Star for four seasons and was a .285 hitter with 213 home runs and 976 RBI, in 1852 games. In 1999, he was named to the Chicago Cubs All-Century Team.\n\nPafko grew up in Boyceville, Wisconsin. The small village did not have a baseball team. Pafko was signed as a 19-year-old by the Class D baseball team in nearby Eau Claire. Pafko learned about the interest from team manager Ivy Griffin while working on his father's farm. \"I still remember the day he pulled into the driveway at the farm in that nice new car\", Pafko said. \"It took me about five minutes to get off the threshing machine and change my clothes. I was gone.\"\n\nIn 1941, Pafko played on the Green Bay Blue Sox team in the Wisconsin State League. He had 12 home runs, 66 RBIs, while batting .349 on the team that won the league championship. He played another season in the minor leagues before debuting in the major leagues in 1943 with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nNicknamed \"Handy Andy\", Pafko was a popular player well known for good hitting and fielding, and contributed to championship-caliber teams in three different cities.\n\nHe played for the Chicago Cubs during their 1945 World Series appearance. After Cubs third baseman Stan Hack retired the following year, Pafko replaced him at third base long enough to be almost named an All-Star there. MLB cancelled the All-Star Game and selection that season due to the war, and the Associated Press sportswriters named Pafko as one of their All-Stars. Pafko did become a four-time consecutive All-Star from 1947 through 1950, making him one of the few players to achieve All-Star status in both the infield and outfield.\n\nPafko was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers in June of 1951 during the middle of the season; he was the left fielder when Bobby Thomson hit the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World.\" Pafko returned home when he was traded to the Boston Braves before the start of the 1953 season, becoming the only Wisconsin native on the Braves roster when they arrived in Milwaukee and participating in their strong contending teams there, including the 1957 World Series champions. Pafko started in the first game at Milwaukee County Stadium on April 3, 1953. A devout Slovak Lutheran, he was an instant favorite with Milwaukee's large Eastern European community. In the mid 1950s, the Milwaukee area Lutherans had an \"Andy Pafko Night\" and gave him a new car.\n\nAfter playing in the major leagues, Pafko managed in the minor leagues, including a two-year stint as the skipper for the Kinston Eagles in the Carolina League. Pafko also scouted for the Montreal Royals in the late 1960s. He was also active in the Milwaukee Braves Historical Association. He eventually settled in the Chicago area, and always provided good copy for the press, especially when the subject of the Cubs would come up. When the Cubs won their division in 1984, Pafko mused, \"I never dreamed it would take them 39 years to win again. I thought they would have won \"by accident\" before then!\" Pafko was named to the Cubs All-Century team at the turn of the 21st century. As of July 2013, Pafko and Lennie Merullo (died May 30, 2015) were the last two men living who played for the Cubs in a World Series.\n\nThe book \"\" (2004) includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Pafko is prominent in many of these stories. He is also the title character in Pafko at the Wall and The Perfect Pafko. He also plays a role in Roger Kahn's American classic, \"The Boys of Summer\".\n\nPafko died at a nursing home in Stevensville, Michigan on October 8, 2013. He was 92.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2054706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054706", "title": "Ardrossan, South Australia", "text": "Ardrossan, South Australia\n\nArdrossan is a town in the Australian state of South Australia located on the east coast of the Yorke Peninsula, about by road from the Adelaide city centre, It is notable for its deepwater shipping port and its towering coastal cliffs of red clay.\n\nThe indigenous owners of the area of which Ardrossan was developed were the Narungga. The first European settlers were pastoralists who established sheep runs. Pastoral Lease No. 232, comprising 27 sq. miles, was taken up in 1852 by William Sharples. Stretching along the coastline, this was known as \"Parara\" (or Parrana/Pirana), meaning 'middle' in the Narungga language, with the homestead near Parara Landing, about three kilometres south of present Ardrossan. Northward of Ardrossan are coastal springs, named Tiddy Widdy or Tittiwitti by the Narungga, being a scarce natural source of fresh water in this region.\n\nIn 1859 partners Parker Bowman (1831–1911) and Edmund Parnell (c.1834–87) took over the Parara leases. After these expired in 1865 the government moved toward establishing closer settlement and grain farming.\n\nThe Hundred of Cunningham was proclaimed 19 June 1873, comprising 134 square miles, and surveying commenced. The Hundred had two government surveyed towns, namely Ardrossan, proclaimed 13 November 1873, and Price, proclaimed 3 August 1882.\n\nBeing at a site formerly known as Clay Gully, after a deep gully leading to its red clay coastal cliffs, the surveyed town of Ardrossan was named by Governor Fergusson after the Ardrossan seaport in Scotland which shared similar geography – 'ard' a height, and 'ros' prominent rock or headland.\n\nThe site was largely chosen because of its potential for shipping infrastructure, allowing wheat farmers to ship their produce across the Gulf St Vincent to Port Adelaide. The residents of the new township petitioned the government for a jetty in 1874. Completed in 1877, this was later extended to better accommodate the larger steamships and windjammers used to export grain overseas. By 1878 there were six houses, a post office, a flour mill, a Methodist church, and a hotel. That same year a public school opened, having 53 pupils.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, and into the early 20th century, the town expanded steadily due to income from the surrounding farms. As well, it became notable as the location of Clarence Smith's factory where he manufactured the Stump-jump plough between 1880 and 1935. This South Australian invention was vital in opening mallee country throughout Australia to the plough.\n\nAlthough the surrounding grain farmers continued to prosper, there was little change in the size of the town during the early 1900s. Indeed, after the depression in the 1930s, the town and its businesses were largely stagnant until a large open-cut dolomite mine was opened by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP) in the 1950s for use in its steel manufacture at Whyalla on the Eyre Peninsula and Port Kembla in New South Wales. A new one kilometre (3,300 ft) long jetty was added and at the same time construction was started with grain storage silos. The 'new' jetty currently services ships loading dolomite, grain and salt from the solar salt pans at Price which are located approximately 10 km (6 mi) north. The wharf is located 1.5 kilometres south of the town jetty, and can accommodate vessels of Handymax class.\n\nThe wharf is being considered for the future export of iron ore and copper concentrates by Rex Minerals Ltd.\n\nArdrossan today is in the local government area of Yorke Peninsula Council, the state electoral district of Narungga and the federal division of Grey.\n\nThe coast and water bodies of Ardrossan support populations of water-fowl, sea and shorebirds and support migratory waders during their summer visitations. Fishing, including the trapping of blue swimmer crabs is a popular pastime for local residents and visiting holiday-makers.\n\nSouth Australia's only recorded group stranding of sperm whales occurred on Parara Beach about south of Ardrossan on 8 December 2014. Seven dead or dying whales were discovered stranded in the intertidal zone south of the BHP jetty. Six of the whales were located in a loose group along several hundred metres of shoreline, with another whale located further to the north. The South Australian museum announced that it would sample the bodies and attempt to collect a complete skeleton for the museum, commencing work on December 10. Biopsy samples were formally taken from five of the whales by Australian Marine Wildlife Research & Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) for analysis on December 9. AMWRRO rejected the proposition that any whales featured propeller strike marks, claiming that the marks they observed were tooth raking marks, resulting from behavior more commonly known to occur among orcas. Several teeth were illegally removed from the animals overnight on December 8.\n\nGrain farming and pastoralism continue to be a mainstay of the local economy.\n\nThe existing dolomite mine and jetty are currently owned and operated by Arrium (formerly Onesteel).\n\nToday, tourism plays an increasingly large part in Ardrossan's economy with the town being a popular destination for Adelaide residents on weekends. While it lacks an attractive swimming beach, it is a popular location to catch fish and blue crabs which are abundant during the months of September through April each year. The town's two jetties are also suitable for scuba-diving, with easy entries and plentiful marine life to observe.\n\nThe historic shipwreck of the \"Zanoni\" is located approximately 15 miles offshore and is a popular scuba diving location. This ship originally sank on 11 February 1867 and was discovered on 17 April 1983 after 116 years. It is one of the best preserved examples of 19th century merchant sailing vessels in Australia.\n\nThe \"Ardrossan News\" (3 February – 7 July 1911) was briefly printed for the town by Thomas Corrigan in Port Wakefield.\n\nArdrossan, like most of the Yorke Peninsula, has a maritime climate. Summers are warm and winters are mild (although mornings and nights tend to be cool/cold) and usually wet.\n\n\n\n"}

It was formed under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme and served in Europe.\n\nThe squadron formed on 7 March 1942, initially at RAF Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, as part of RAF Fighter Command and equipped with Hawker Hurricane IIs.\n\nFor a while 486 Sqn. was a nightfighter unit tasked with working in conjunction with No. 1453 Turbinlite Flight. The radar-equipped but unarmed Turbinlite (Douglas Boston medium bombers with a searchlight in the nose) were to locate and illuminate enemy aircraft at which point an accompanying Hurricane could make the attack.\n\nThe squadron was re-equipped with Hawker Typhoons starting in July 1942 and continued the experiments with the Turbinlites.\n\nIn September 1942 486 became a day fighter unit flying standing patrols. Standing patrol missions ('anti-Rhubarbs') were meant to counter The Fw 190 and Bf 109 fighter bombers that flew at high speed and very low altitude. Because of this there was often very little radar warning. To counter such attacks Typhoon squadrons kept at least one pair of aircraft flying continuously, with another pair \"on readiness\" (in the cockpit and ready to take off within two minutes) to relieve them, throughout daylight hours. 486 Sqn. Typhoons usually flew at 500 feet or lower, still giving them enough height to spot and attack incoming enemy aircraft to counter the low altitude Fw 190 and Bf 109 fighter bombers, a role for which the fast, powerful Typhoon was well suited. While flying patrols over the South coast against these 'nuisance' raids in early 1943, the squadron shot down 11 fighter-bombers in 2 months. Other enemy aircraft encountered and shot down included Do 217 night bombers engaged in mine laying missions.\n\nFrom June 1943, 486 Sqn. flew mainly as a fighter bomber unit. In September 1943, with 197 Sqn 486 Sqn became part of the RAF Tangmere Hawker Typhoon Wing commanded by Wing Commander D J Scott. As a fighter bomber unit 486's targets included shipping and airfields, and an attack on one of Hitler's secret weapons, the Vergeltungswaffe V3 long range multi-barrel gun. Several escort missions were also provided for RAF light and medium day bombers (Havoc and Mitchell). While mounted on Typhoons 486 Sqn claimed 22.3 enemy aircraft shot down.\n\nRe-equipped with Hawker Tempests, initially in January – February 1944, and later again in April. Although 486 Sqn was the first unit to receive Tempests, 3 Squadron was the first unit fully equipped. The unit was changed back to fighter defence after D-Day and claimed 223½ V-1 flying bombs, the second highest number of any unit. At the end of April 1944 the 486 squadron became part of No. 150 Wing RAF, along with 3 Squadron and 56 Squadron. (the latter still equipped with Spitfire VBs and, later, Hawker Typhoons), under the command of Wing Commander Roland Beamont. Beamont wrote about 486 Sqn.\n\"...an exuberant bunch of New Zealanders with a brilliant record on Typhoons and a rather casual approach (as I was soon to find out) to King's Regulations and Air Council instructions – and to \"Pommy Bastard\" wing leaders!\" \nApart from the anti-Diver (V-1) operations, 150 Wing undertook several night-time, as well as the more usual daytime, ground attack sorties.\n\nOn 28 September 1944 with the V-1 threat over, 150 Wing became 122 Hawker Tempest Wing, trading places with three Mustang III squadrons. Later additions to 122 Wing included 80 Squadron and 274 Squadron; 41 Squadron, a Grffon-engined Spitfire XIV unit was also a part of the Wing, providing high altitude cover. 122 Wing was attached to the Second Tactical Air Force, and moved through Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Denmark. The wing's role was low-medium altitude fighter operations, although many ground attack missions were also undertaken. During these operations German light and medium Flak took a steady toll of Tempest units. 486 lost two commanding officers, Arthur E Umbers and Keith G Taylor-Cannon, to flak in the last few months of the war.\n\nSoon after the war ended, 486 Squadron left 122 Wing and moved to Kastrup in Denmark. This was considered to be a \"perk job\" and the personnel of 486 were given an opportunity to unwind and relax, with each pilot being expected to log four hours of Tempest flying per month. On 1 July 1945 the squadron took part in an air display and airfield open day which was attended by the Danish Royal Family and some 300,000 Danes. One of the attractions was the strafing and sinking of old Luftwaffe Bv 138 flying boats anchored in Øresund strait.\n\nThe squadron was disbanded on 12 October 1945 at RAF Dunsfold, England.\n\n486 squadron flew over 11,000 sorties claimed 81 enemy aircraft, (including two Messerschmitt 262 jets) and destroyed 223½ (or 241) V-1 \"flying bombs\", 323 motor vehicles, 14 railway engines and 16 ships. Pilots attached to the squadron won 22 DFCs,a DSO and six Mentioned in Dispatches. While mounted on Tempests 486 Sqn claimed 59.5 enemy aircraft shot down; first place for Tempest victories. 56 Sqn. was second with 59.2.\n\nBy the end of the war nearly 50% of 486(NZ) Squadron's personnel were non-New Zealanders; for example F. Philip \"Joe\" Kendall, a British national and a highly regarded member of the unit served with the squadron from March to July 1945. Two of 486's commanding officers, Squadron Leaders Roberts (March 1942 – April 1943) and Iremonger (January 1944 – December 1944) were also British.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1904, he was appointed professor of Oriental languages at the University of Berlin.\n\nWinckler studied at the University of Berlin with Eberhard Schrader, founder of the German Assyriology. He was awarded his doctorate on 24 June 1886, for his work on the cuneiform texts of Sargon.\n\nWinckler became a lecturer at the University of Berlin in 1891. In 1904, he was appointed Extraordinary Professor of Oriental languages.\n\nWinckler began excavations at Boğazkale in 1906 with support from the German Orient Society together with Ottoman archeologist Theodore Makridi. His excavations revealed a stockpile of thousands of hardened clay tablets, many written in the hitherto unknown Hittite language, that allowed Winckler to draw a preliminary outline of Hittite history in the 14th and 13th centuries BC. Winckler continued excavations at the site until 1912, during which time his finds proved that the city was once the capital of a great empire. The language on the tablets, known as the Bogazköy Archive was deciphered in 1915 by the Czech scholar Bedřich Hrozný.\n\nOtto Rank, in Art and Artist, describes Winckler as the \"rediscoverer of the ancient Oriental world picture in the fifth to sixth millennium B.C. Winckler's popular description: \"The whole universe is the great world, the macrocosm; its parts are small universes in themselves, microcosms. Such a *microcosm* is man, who is himself an image of the universe and a perfect being. But the great universe is likewise a man, and as it is `God,' God has human form. *`In his own image,'* therefore, was man created. This was still the belief of medieval medicine, which we know to have had (chiefly for the purpose of bleeding) a method of dividing up the human body according to the twelve signs of the zodiac (head, ram; neck, bull; arms, twins; and so on). On this `scientific' treatment of a patient was based... \"\n\nRank also wrote in \"Art and Artist\", regarding the significance of macroscosmic symbolism, \"In the first, and still the best, summary of this sort, which Winckler gives us in the chapter \"Myth, Legend, and Play\" of his popular account of the intellectual culture of ancient Babylon, the fundamental fact is established that the festivals connected with various games had all a seasonal character, with a definite calendar as their basis. In these festivals and the associated games, \"the events in heaven which the festival represents--for example, the death and rebirth of the deity, the victory over the powers of darkness, the dragon--are represented and played before the people\"\n\n\n"}

Local artists and schools decorated hundreds of full-sized fiberglass pig statues and installed them throughout the downtown area. The events were organized by ArtWorks, a community art employment program.\n\nThe Big Pig Gig was one of many projects inspired by CowParade, which had been featured in Chicago the previous year. Laura Pulfer, a columnist at \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\", wrote about seven-year-old Alexander Longi's proposal to Mayor Roxanne Qualls for an event similar to the one in Chicago. The idea to build statues of pigs recalled Cincinnati's annual Flying Pig Marathon and the city's nickname of \"Porkopolis\". The nickname dates from the mid–19th century, when the Cincinnati meat packing industry led the country. The project's rhyming name was submitted by Joyce Monger and won a naming contest.\n\nWith the support of ArtWorks and various local businesses and media outlets, the project attracted 425 entries, many of which depicted \"flying pigs\". Hundreds of pigs were installed downtown, while others were stationed across the Ohio River in Newport and Covington, Kentucky. They stretched north to Findlay Market, east to Eden Park, south to the Covington Cathedral, and west to Union Terminal. Participants included over 50 schools. More than 500,000 visitors brought an estimated $170 million to the city. The exhibit officially began May 14 and ended October 31.\n\nA number of these statues have been sold on eBay for charity since the event, and many others have come to decorate the Cincinnati airport, local hotels, and other buildings. The following year saw a similar though less publicized event in which large flower pots were decorated and placed throughout downtown.\n\nArtWorks organized a smaller exhibit, which went on display from June to September 2012, to coincide with the World Choir Games.

{"id": "2054729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054729", "title": "Legacy preferences", "text": "Legacy preferences\n\nLegacy preference or legacy admission is a preference given by an institution or organization to certain applicants on the basis of their familial relationship to alumni of that institution, with college admissions being the field in which legacy preferences are most controversially used. Students so admitted are referred to as legacies or legacy students. Legacy preferences in college and university admissions are particularly widespread in the United States; almost three-quarters of research universities and nearly all liberal arts colleges grant legacy preferences in admissions.\n\nSchools vary in how broadly they extend legacy preferences, with some schools granting this favor only to children of undergraduate alumni, while other schools extend the favor to children, grandchildren, siblings, nephews, and nieces of alumni of undergraduate and graduate programs. A 2005 analysis of 180,000 student records obtained from nineteen selective colleges and universities found that, within a set range of SAT scores, being a legacy raised an applicant's chances of admission by 19.7 percentage points.\n\nA 1992 survey found that of the top seventy-five universities in the \"U.S. News & World Report\" rankings, only one (the California Institute of Technology) had no legacy preferences at all; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also affirmed that it does not practice legacy admissions. Legacy preferences were ubiquitous among the one hundred top-ranked liberal arts colleges as well. The only liberal arts college in the top one hundred that explicitly said it did not use legacy preferences was Berea.\n\nCurrently, the Ivy League institutions are estimated to admit 10% to 15% of each entering class using legacy admissions. For example, in the 2008 entering undergraduate class, the University of Pennsylvania admitted 41.7% of legacies who applied during the early decision admissions round and 33.9% of legacies who applied during the regular admissions cycle, versus 29.3% of all students who applied during the early decision admissions round and 16.4% of all who applied during the regular cycle. In 2009, Princeton admitted 41.7% of legacy applicants—more than 4.5 times the 9.2% rate of non-legacies. Similarly, in 2006, Brown University admitted 33.5% of alumni children, significantly higher than the 13.8% overall admissions rate. In short, Ivy League and other top schools typically admit legacies at two to five times their overall admission rates. Among top universities, the University of Notre Dame and Georgetown University are known to weigh legacy status heavily in their application processes.\n\nThe advantages that colleges offer legacy students extend well beyond admission preferences. Many colleges have various mechanisms for coaching legacies through the admissions process and for advising them about strategies for constructing successful applications, including notifying legacies of the edge that they can gain by applying early. Some universities have alumni councils that provide legacies with special advising sessions, pair these would-be students with current legacy students, and generally provide advice and mentoring for legacy applicants. Some universities employ admissions counselors dedicated solely to legacy applicants, and it is common to provide scholarships or tuition discounts earmarked especially for legacies and for legacies to be charged in-state tuition fees when they are out-of-state residents. In cases where legacies are rejected, some universities offer legacy admissions counseling and help with placement at other colleges. Such students are often encouraged to enroll at a lesser ranked school for one or two years to prove themselves and then to reapply as transfer students. Because rankings by \"U.S. News & World Report\" and other media take into account only the SAT scores and high school grades of entering freshmen, a college can accept poor achieving legacies as transfer students without hurting its standing. Harvard caters to the children of well-connected alumni and big donors through the \"Z-list.\" Z-listers are often guaranteed admittance while in high school but are obliged to take a year off between high school and Harvard, doing whatever they wish in the interim.\n\nFormer Harvard University president Lawrence Summers has stated, \"Legacy admissions are integral to the kind of community that any private educational institution is.\" In the 1998 book \"The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions\", authors William G. Bowen, former Princeton University president, and Derek Bok, former Harvard University president, found \"the overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates.\" While the preference is quite common in elite universities and liberal arts colleges, it is quite controversial, with 75% of Americans opposing the preference.\n\nEconomists, on the other hand, are divided over whether the practice is beneficial overall, because studies have shown that it motivates increased donations from alumni.\n\nAt some schools, legacy preferences have an effect on admissions comparable to other programs such as athletic recruiting or affirmative action. One study of three selective private research universities in the United States showed the following effects (admissions disadvantage and advantage in terms of SAT points on the 1600-point scale):\n\nAlthough it may initially appear that students of color are the most favored of all the groups in terms of college admissions, in practice, widespread legacy preferences have reduced acceptance rates for black, Latino, and Asian-American applicants because the overwhelming majority of legacy students are white. According to a 2008 study, Duke's legacies are more likely to be white, Protestant, American citizens, and private high school graduates than the overall student body. In 2000-2001, of 567 alumni children attending Princeton, 10 were Latino and 4 were black. Similarly, a 2005 study reported that half of the legacy applicants to selective colleges boasted family incomes in the top quartile of American earnings, compared to 29% of non-legacy students. In 2003, Texas A&M—which no longer practices legacy admissions—enrolled 312 white students and only 27 Latino and 6 black students who would not have been admitted if not for their family ties. Since 1983, there have been formal complaints to the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) that Asian-American applicants are being rejected in favor of students with lesser credentials.\n\nIn 1990, the OCR determined that Harvard had admitted legacies at twice the rate of other applicants, that in several cases legacy status \"was the critical or decisive favor\" in a decision to admit an applicant, and that legacy preferences help explain why 17.4% of white applicants were admitted compared with only 13.2% of Asian-American applicants during the previous decade. The OCR also found that legacies on average were rated lower than applicants who were neither legacies nor athletes in every important category (excluding athletic ability) in which applicants were judged.\n\nIn the 1990s, the University of California's Board of Regents voted to ban the use of affirmative action preferences throughout the system, and legacy privilege was abandoned across the University of California system soon after.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld race-conscious admissions policies in its 2003 \"Grutter v. Bollinger\" decision, involving the University of Michigan's law school. The only significant criticism of legacy preferences from the Court came from Justice Clarence Thomas, the sole member of the Supreme Court who grew up poor.\n\nWhile the majority of Americans have been shown to strongly oppose legacy admissions, its beneficiaries hold key positions in Congress and the judiciary, protecting this practice from political and legal challenge.\n\nWhile many schools say that a main reason for legacy preferences is to increase donations, at an aggregate (school-wide) level the decision to prefer legacies has not been shown to increase donations. However, in some instances, while alumni donations may go up if a child is intending on applying, donations fall if that child is rejected.\n\nBecause private universities in the U.S. rely heavily on donations from alumni, critics argue that legacy preferences are a way to indirectly sell university placement. Opponents accuse these programs of perpetuating an oligarchy and plutocracy as they lower the weight of academic merit in the admissions process in exchange for a financial one. Legacy students tend to be the white and wealthy, contributing to socioeconomic inequality.\n\nIn 2008, alumni donations accounted for 27.5% of all donations to higher education in the U.S. In effect, in an era of steeply declining governmental funding to post-secondary education, universities and colleges feel forced to rely heavily on private donations from alumni for donations to fund university operations budgets and infrastructure.\n\nSome supporters of the elimination of all non-academic preferences point out that many European universities, including highly selective institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge, do not use legacy, racial, or athletic preferences in admissions decisions.\n\nThere are also legal arguments against legacy preferences. In public schools, legacy preferences may violate the Nobility Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by creating a hereditary privilege and discriminating on the basis of ancestry. Legacy preferences in both public and private universities may be illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (now codified in Section 1981 of the U.S. Code).\n\nA 2019 survey of leading economists showed that there was near-unanimity that legacy admissions crowded out applicants with greater academic potential. However, the economists were divided as to whether the existence of legacy admissions meant that universities had a less beneficial impact on society than if there were no legacy admissions.\n\n\n"}

This rare World Series low-hit game (there have only been 5 in the 100-plus years of the Series) was matched by fellow Cubs star Claude Passeau in 1945 when he threw just the second one-hitter in Series history, only to be surpassed by Don Larsen's perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series.\n\nHis best year was 1908, when he won 24 games for the National League and World Series champion Cubs, their last Series championship until they won it again in 2016. He pitched two shutouts in one day against the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 26, 1908. No other pitcher has ever accomplished this feat in the major leagues.\n\nIn a 1976 \"Esquire\" magazine article, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All Time All-Star Argument Starter\", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Reulbach was the right-handed pitcher on Stein's Jewish team, though Reulbach was, in fact, Roman Catholic and is buried in Montclair, New Jersey's Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Cemetery.\n\nHe died in 1961 on the same day (July 17) as Ty Cobb and was buried in Immaculate Conception Cemetery, Montclair. Reulbach was the last surviving Chicago Cub to have played in the 1907 and 1908 World Series, their most recent world championship until 2016.\n\nReulbach played college baseball at the University of Notre Dame in 1903 and 1904. He played for the University of Vermont in 1905, accumulating a 4-0 record before signing a contract with the Chicago Cubs in May.\n\n\n"}

He began publishing hymns in 1732 while a pastor in southern Jutland. His most important work was \"Troens rare klenodie\" (1739; \"The Rare Jewel of the Faith\"), which contained many translations of German Pietist hymns and 82 original pieces and went through seven editions in Brorson's lifetime. He was elected bishop of Ribe in 1741, where he remained for the rest of his life. His outward social success as a clerical administrator was contrasted by private sorrows (an insane son, the early death of his first wife) but he resigned himself to his fate. Some of these problems are probably reflected in a second book of hymns, \"Svanesang\" (\"Swan Song\"), that was published posthumously in 1765. From this collection must be mentioned the still popular and hopeful funeral hymn \"Her vil ties\" (\"Here will be silent\")\n\nAlmost forgotten after his death but \"re-detected\" during the romantic period Brorson is now ranked among the four greatest Danish hymn writers. His tune is not as strong as that of Kingo but in return he is more of a lyricist. Besides he is perhaps the first important Southern Jutland poet in Danish literature. The Christmas hymn \"Den yndigste rose er funden\" (1732) is included in the Danish Culture Canon.\n\nBrorson's lyrics formed the basis of the first two of Edvard Grieg's Fire Salmer, 'Guds søn har gjort mig fri' ('God's son has set me free') and 'Hvad est du dog skjøn' ('O but you are beautiful').\n\nHe is buried in Ribe Cathedral.\n\nSongs\n\n"}

It first aired in the United States in 1994 on PBS. The documentary has won numerous awards for journalism, including the George Polk Award for best television documentary.\n\nAccording to Emerson, the impetus for the documentary came in 1992, when he happened to come across a conference of Arab youths in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. After gaining entrance by pretending to be Muslim, Emerson said that he found tables of pro-terrorism literature from groups such as Hamas and heard speeches calling for death to Americans.\n\nThe documentary features hidden camera footage of men publicly raising money for terrorism in U.S. hotel conference rooms. The men are often speaking in Arabic. Emerson also accused Sami Al-Arian of being the primary supporter of the Islamic jihad in the United States, and described Tampa as \"a hotbed of Islamic extremism\" and called the University of Southern Florida \"Jihad University\". He said that Al-Arian was an Islamic extremist, and headed the Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in the U.S. Al-Arian's trial was repeatedly delayed, and after many months it ended in acquittals on eight counts and a hung jury on nine other counts. After prosecutors threatened a re-trial in 2006, Al-Arian agreed to a plea deal. He pleaded guilty to one felony count of aiding the PIJ, a designated terrorist group, and was sentenced to 57 months in prison, most of which he had already served while in custody awaiting trial.\n\nAfter the documentary's release, American Muslim groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations accused Emerson of mischaracterizing speeches and taking innocuous language and activities out of context to make them appear more menacing. The documentary was faulted for misrepresentations and bigotry, and Robert Friedman accused Emerson of \"creating mass hysteria against American Arabs.\"\n\nIn 1995, U.S. representatives Bill McCollum of Florida and Gary Ackerman of New York distributed the videotape to every member of the House of Representatives, accompanied by a letter urging them to watch the documentary before the House began debating anti-terrorism legislation that summer. The move was decried by Arab American and Muslim leaders for linking terrorism to Arabs and Muslims.\n\nEmerson and his work gained renewed attention following the September 11, 2001 attacks by terrorists on the United States; later in 2001, Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey credited Emerson's documentary with helping to pass a recent anti-terrorism bill in the House.\n\n\n"}

From 1935 through 1947, Passeau played with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1935), Philadelphia Phillies (1936–39) and Chicago Cubs (1939–47). He batted and threw right-handed. In a 13-year career, Passeau posted a 162–150 record with 1104 strikeouts and a 3.32 ERA in 2179 innings.\n\nPasseau was a native of Waynesboro, Mississippi. He was a graduate of Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi, where he joined Kappa Sigma.\nPasseau was considered the finest college quarterback in Mississippi, but he chose to pursue an athletic career in professional baseball rather than football after graduation.\n\nPasseau started his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, then played for several years with the Philadelphia Phillies at their notorious \"bandbox\" ballpark, Baker Bowl, before being traded to the Chicago Cubs, where he had several winning seasons.\n\nPasseau surrendered the game-winning home run to Ted Williams in the 1941 All-Star Game.\n\nPasseau's greatest individual performance came in Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, in which he pitched a one-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. Slugger Rudy York got the Tigers' only hit, in the second inning, and the Cubs took a 2-games-to-1 edge. Due to wartime travel restrictions that were still in place, despite the war having ended, the first three games were in Detroit and the last four in Chicago. Back in Wrigley Field, the Cubs lost three of four games, their last appearance in the Series until 2016. Passeau was the starting pitcher for the Cubs in Game 6, but had to be removed from the game during the sixth inning after he injured his pitching hand while fielding a hard smash. Passeau had a comfortable lead in the game, but the Chicago bullpen could not check the Tigers. The game went into extra innings and the Cubs emptied their bench. Hank Borowy, who was scheduled to pitch Game 7, was pressed into service and pitched four innings as Chicago won the game in twelve innings. Passeau's injury proved to be costly as the Cubs were without a well rested pitcher to face Hal Newhouser in the final game.\n\nThat one-hit game was only the second low-hit game in the history of the Series; the first was pitched by the Cubs' Ed Reulbach in 1906. There have only been four low-hit Series games since, including Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, and Roy Halladay's one walk no hitter in the 2010 NLDS, which are the only two no-hitters in MLB postseason history.\n\nPasseau was a better than average hitting pitcher, as he had a career average of .192 (189–982), hitting 15 home runs and recording 80 RBI in a 13-year career. On May 19, 1941, he hit a grand slam home run and had 5 RBI in a 14–1 victory over the Dodgers. In the 1937, 1941 and 1942 seasons, he compiled 11, 12 and 10 RBI respectively.\n\nPasseau died in Lucedale, Mississippi, aged 94.\n\n\n"}

However, it is understood at law that inspection is often not sufficient to detect certain deficiencies in the product that can only be discovered through destructive testing or other means that a seller could not reasonably be expected to allow under normal conditions. For example, wood beams and interior brickwork often cannot be fully assessed without destructive testing, and it would be unreasonable for the seller to allow the buyer to destroy part of the property in order to discover such defects.\n\nAs such, the law expects that buyers will protect themselves in the sales contract against defects they cannot possibly be expected to assess prior to purchase. As such, the term \"latent defect\" is often used as part of the guarantee clauses in a sales contract so that the buyer can recover damages from the seller if defects turn up in the property after the sale. For example, the seller may be required to pay for repairs of any such damage.\n\nIn Common Law, there is no automatic right for a buyer to claim against a seller for such latent defects when they are discovered, absent an agreement in contract. Civil Law in some jurisdictions (Quebec, Canada) does provide for such an automatic right unless a property is sold \"without guarantee\" as to its quality. However, if a latent defect is discovered, there is often a presumption against the seller when a claim is made in misrepresentation that the seller knew about the latent defect. As such, the seller is required to show that he or she could not possibly have known of the defect, rather than the buyer having to show that the seller did know about the defect. However, if it can be shown the seller could not have known about the defect (and was not wilfully blind to the possibility) then the buyer's claim will not succeed.\n\nHowever, when the defect could have been discovered by the buyer by a thorough inspection (a \"patent defect\"), the buyer cannot possibly succeed in a claim against the seller unless the seller actively took steps to hide the defect from a normal inspection.\n\nIn all cases, where a seller actively misrepresents the condition of the property, such as by taking steps to make an inspection impossible or by lying about problems when directly asked, the buyer will almost always succeed unless it can be shown that the buyer was independently aware of the defect and completed the transaction nevertheless.\n\nIn construction contracting a latent defect is defined as a defect which exists at the time of acceptance but cannot be discovered by a reasonable inspection.\n"}

It is owned by the Evansville/Vanderburgh Airport Authority.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 204,352 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2016\nand 203,350 in 2015, indicating a 0.49% increase in yearly enplanements for the airport.\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017-2021 calls it a \"non-hub primary service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).\n\nIt has 34 daily flights to and from airline hubs: Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, and Orlando/Sanford.\n\nBuilt in 1928 on 260 acres (1.1 km²) of land along U.S. Highway 41 and funded by a city bond issue, the original airport had a small terminal, weather bureau, hangar, runways, boundary lights, grading, and drainage.\n\nOn June 16, 1930 the Evansville Municipal Airport was dedicated. The runways, 100 X 1,200 feet and four inches thick, cost $30,000. The first Evansville Airport Manager was Werner J. Genot, who took charge on December 16, 1930.\n\nInterstate Airlines stopped at Evansville on their Chicago-Atlanta and St. Louis-Louisville routes on October 19, 1928. Also in 1928, Capital Air Corporation started passenger flights through Evansville. The airport did not have an airline from February 1933 until 1940, when Eastern Airlines started two departures a day. Plans were made for expansion.\n\nIn 1950 a new terminal opened at a cost of $787,000. The Evansville City Council passed an ordinance to change the name of the airport to Dress Memorial Airport on October 11, 1950, and on October 29, 1950, the new terminal was dedicated. The airport property now covered 467 acres; 347 acres was used for aircraft operations and 120 acres was used for agriculture.\n\nThe first jet at the Evansville airport landed in September 1964, a chartered 727 carrying presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.\nThe original terminal was replaced in 1988 with the new William H. Dress Terminal, designed by Hafer Associates with 140,000 square feet (13,000 m²) and ten gates.\n\nIn January 2012, the airport announced the adding of four new jet bridges. At the beginning of 2013, the jet bridges were installed. This allowed passengers to avoid having to exit the terminal and board the plane from the outside. It was the first time Evansville Regional Airport had new jet bridges, since US Air exited the Evansville market in the 1990s. A subsequent ribbon cutting took place at the airport on 17 January 2013.\n\nIn the 2010s, the airport began to see passenger growth. In response to this, on August 20, 2014, Delta Air Lines upgraded to a Boeing 717 with daily service to Atlanta. Delta further upgraded to a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 at the beginning of summer in 2015, in addition with current 717 service, occasionally replacing the smaller aircraft on some flights. Currently Delta runs the 717 service for its first flight out of Evansville and its late flight into Evansville. Delta has recently stopped their 717 service in Evansville due to aging aircraft, but has replaced that aircraft with the Bombardier CRJ-900 for its Atlanta service. Also, on October 2, 2014, American Eagle began daily service to Charlotte using a Bombardier CRJ-200. On June 4, 2015, United Express began three daily flights to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago utilizing the Embraer ERJ-145. Currently American Eagle uses a Bombardier CRJ-900 for its Dallas-Fort Worth service.\n\nAfter further growth and expansion at the airport, the Evansville/Vanderburgh Airport Authority approved the construction of a fifth jet bridge in Concourse A.

The WiFi Lounge has 24/7 internet access and chairs and tables. The Meals & More Restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, daily specials, and has a gift shop. The Cocktail Lounge has brand-name beers, wines, spirits, and local favorites for passengers' 21 and over enjoyment, with flat screen TVs and sitting areas. An assortment of different games and a play room for children are offered in the front of the terminal. Visitors can browse a collection of airplane models with brief facts on each of the planes. The airport has an observation area in the concourse. There are meeting rooms free of charge to conduct business meetings while still in the terminal. Valets are available outside to assist with luggage and parking. Hotel shuttles to different lodging accommodations in the Evansville area can be requested in the front of the terminal. The terminal has two concourses set for Allegiant, American, Delta, and United, respectively. Concourse A has three jet bridges and one hardstand gate, while Concourse B has two jet bridges and six hardstand gates, and each has vending machines, restrooms and drinking fountains. Delta and United operate out of Concourse A, gates A1-A4. Allegiant and American operate out of Concourse B, gates B1-B6.\n\nPrevious service included Century Airlines, Trans World Express, Eastern Air Lines, Air Illinois, US Air, Piedmont Airlines, Chicago Express Airlines, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Northwest Airlink, Comair, Britt Airways, Cape Air, Interstate Airlines, and Capital Air Corporation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2054773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054773", "title": "The Raven (characters)", "text": "The Raven (characters)\n\nThe Raven are a band of mercenaries who are the protagonists of several novels by James Barclay.\n\nThey are in his two trilogies:\n\nThe Raven are band of mercenaries, from the continent of Balaia, who are famous, with a reputation for being the best at what they do. As a result, they already have all the money they need and so the fights and missions they choose to do during the books are what they choose to do and not what they are paid to do - this means that they do what they consider to be the just and right thing to do. The Raven have been together ten years before the beginning of DawnThief, and have already lost two members named Kirst and Halyn.\n\nEach time a member of the Raven dies they observe their own private rituals, holding a Vigil and promising never to forget the dead member.\n\nThe Raven are a very close knit group of friends. They share an utter belief that they will succeed in what they choose to do simply because they are The Raven.\n\nTheir code of conduct is such that they will never commit an act of murder, never take an action without consulting the rest of the group and will trust one another with their lives.\n\nNothing is more important to them than their group and whilst they will fight for country, plane and the greater good of their world; it is wholly because of their love for one another that they decide on which missions to undertake. Even then the matter is discussed by The Raven as a whole before it is acted upon and all major decisions for the group are discussed openly amongst them.\n\nThey all devote themselves entirely to each other, such that should any one of them need help then the others will let nothing stand in their way to give it, even war or death.\n\nThe Raven has several characters, each of which has a different personality and set of skills. The characters in the Raven change over time, as some characters die while other characters join them.\n\nThe Unknown Warrior, also known as Sol after becoming a Protector, appears to act as the leader and tactician of the Raven. He is an extremely tall and strong man and a fearsome warrior. His preferred weapon is a two-handed sword, and his trademark is to rhythmically tap the point of his sword on the ground before battle to clear his head. He often acts as the level-headed member of the Raven, silencing them, breaking up squabbles and so on when needed. He dies during DawnThief, but the Xetesk take his soul and turn him into a Protector (magical expert warriors who are bound by magic and punished by Demons if they misbehave) who is assigned to protect Denser, his \"Given\". Despite being banned from speaking of his previous life, Hirad recognises him through his habit of tapping his sword. The Raven eventually succeed in releasing him from his Thrall. He becomes a hero for the rest of the Protectors who also want to be freed and as a result they will refuse to attack him, which becomes convenient for the Raven in several situations. Despite no longer being a Protector, he continues to have a bond and can feel when other Protectors are nearby. One of his vows is to release the rest of his brethren. The Unknown plays a key part throughout the events of \"Dawnthief\" and \"Noonshade\" and is the first person Denser seeks assistance from during \"Nightchild\", set 6 years after the first two books. The Unknown is now joint owner of the Rookery, the tavern where the original Raven were formed, and is married to Diera and has a baby son called Jonas. Reluctantly he joins the hunt for Lyanna.\n\nHirad is the Raven's other warrior, a barbarian who lives to fight. He fights with a sword and enjoys roaring during battle to intimidate the enemy and to clear his head. When around the camp fire he is the main source of banter, often riling up \"Ilkar\" and \"Denser\". Although it does not seem it, despite all the banter and arguing he is extremely fond of the members of the Raven and we see occasional glimpses of this, notably at the end of ElfSorrow. During NoonShade he becomes the \"Dragonene\" for \"Sha-Kaan\" and looks after the dragons during their enforced exile to Balaia after the events of NoonShade.\n\nIlkar is the first of the Raven's mages, an elf and a Julatsan mage. During battles he usually provides defence from magical attack through a spell named SpellShield although he provides offense on many occasions as well. During the Raven's retirement he takes over the reconstruction of his ruined college, Julatsa. He leaves this to help save the NightChild but does not return due to the events during ElfSorrow. During ElfSorrow the elves' temple is ransacked by Xetesk and a statue of Yniss is damaged which causes an illness to start attacking the elves at random. It is revealed that unless the statue is repaired then all the elves will die. Ilkar unfortunately falls ill with the disease and sacrifices himself to allow the Raven escape the BlackWings and successfully repair the statue, thus ending the disease. Hirad was particularly affected by Ilkar's death and blames every Xetestian (other than Denser) and himself for Ilkar's death. During the remaining Legends of the Raven Ilkar's absence, or in some cases his presence, is keenly felt. From the dimension of the dead he aids The Raven in their final mission to close the tear in the demon dimension which leads to Balaia\n\nErienne is a Dordovan mage and later Denser's wife. She provides several offensive spells for the Raven as well as HardShield to protect them from projectiles such as arrows. Her speciality are several healing spells, which the Raven often need after their battles. She has three children, all of which die. The first two are twins who are murdered by the \"Black Wings\" (individuals who believe magic is evil and kill mages as a result of this belief). The third is her child with Denser, Lyanna, who bears the One magic. She becomes the NightChild but is too young to contain her power. The Al-Drechar transfer her power to Erienne but in doing so Lyanna dies. In the Legends of the Raven Erienne is struggling to recover from her grief and her hatred of the surviving Al-Drechar. Ultimately she must accept their help in order to control the One magic inside herself.\n\nSirendor Larn was one of the original members of the Raven. The lovable joker of the group, Sirendor Larn had just announced his retirement from the Raven in order to wed his fiancee at the beginning of DawnThief. Unfortunately, on the same night as his announcement he is killed by a poisoned dagger meant for Denser. Hirad takes the death of his best friend very hard and it takes him a long time before he can forgive Denser for Sirendor's death.\n\nRas, Richmond and Talan join The Raven after the deaths of Kirst and Halyn, six years before DawnThief begins, as an already established group of warrior mercenaries. Ras dies in the battle at the very beginning of the first book. Richmond dies later on in DawnThief during a raid of the Blackwing's fortress. After the loss of both of his friends, Talan's grief and fear get the better of him and he confesses to Hirad that he can no longer fight with the Raven. He isn't mentioned again in the Raven books.\n\nDenser is the third Raven mage. He belongs to the Dark College of Mage, \"Xetesk\". During the \"Unknown Warriors\" time as a Protector, he is the Unknown's \"Given\". Initially he is not a member of the Raven, but slowly becomes closer and closer to them until his allegiance switches away from his college and he becomes a member of the Raven. He falls in love with and later marries Erienne. He is proficient at casting many offensive spells. After casting DawnThief he attains a clearer understanding of mana and thus becomes one of the best mages on Balaia (Ilkar and Erienne also being in this league).\n\nWill Begman is a thief who is introduced during DawnThief who joins and helps the Raven. He fights with two small daggers. Sadly, Will dies during NoonShade, after being traumatised from a battle with Demons.\n\nThraun is a shapechanger, who can change between being a man and a wolf. His best friend is \"Will\" and he joins the Raven at the same time. Will is the only man he trusts to bring him back from being a wolf, which Will does by saying the word 'Remember' to him. He is a very strong man, a good fighter and as a wolf extremely dangerous. He is almost invulnerable due to being a shapechanger. Emotionally, he has a very rough ride during the books. He blames himself for Will's death and changes to a wolf to escape his guilt and grief. After 6 years, his wolf pack also die and again he also blames himself. Full of grief and guilt he retreats back into his human form. Due to his long period as a wolf he has almost forgotten his human self and does not fully return to human form at first. Mentally his return to his old self takes much longer.\n\nJandyr joins the Raven along with Will and Thraun, and fills the much desired position of elven bowman. His enhanced elven sight means that he barely ever misses his targets. However towards the end of DawnThief he receives a terrible injury whilst protecting Will, and this inevitably leads to his death in the last battle due to his weakened state.\n\nAeb is a Protector who is Denser's \"Given\" during ElfSorrow and close to \"Sol\" through a bond from his time as a Protector. He becomes a member of the Raven. Eventually Xetesk choose reassign him away from Denser. He chooses to rebel against his masters in order to aid the Raven, which leads to his death.\n\nDarrick is the (ex-)general of the army belonging to the college of \"Lystern\", and known as the best military man on Balaia. He rebels and deserts the army in protest of their alliance with \"Dordover\" when he learns they in turn are allied with the \"Black Wings\". He decides his conscience would be better served by joining the Raven. He continues to feel for \"Lystern\" and on occasion he offers their new general advice in order to protect the lives of his men. Although he has committed treason by deserting, many of his men feel sympathy for his decision and his replacement will listen to his advice rather than arrest him, as he should do.\n\nRen is an elf from \"Calaius\" and a member of the \"Guild of Drech\", which look after the \"Al'Drechar\". She appears in NightChild and aids Erienne during her journey to get the Raven to help herself, the Al'Drechar and Lyanna. She falls in love with Ilkar and joins the Raven, but dies at the end of ElfSorrow while protecting the Raven.\n\nLyanna is the daughter of Erienne and Denser. She is the conceived during the events of DawnThief and born before NightChild. She is the \"NightChild\" after which this book is known, and dies at the end of this book.\n\nDiera and Jonas are the \"Unknown Warrior's\" wife and son. They are first mentioned in NightChild, with the \"Unknown Warrior\" marrying \"Diera\" during his brief retirement between the end of NoonShade and the start of NightChild.\n\nTomas is a close friend of the \"Unknown Warrior\". Together, they run \"The Rookery\", an inn in \"Korina\" (the capital of Balaia. During his temporary retirement he returns to run the inn with \"Tomas\".\n\nRebraal is Ilkar's older brother, who we meet in ElfSorrow. The brothers have not seen each other for a hundred years, and Rebraal presumed him dead. Rebraal is a member of the Al-Arynaar who protect the temple at Aryndeneth.\n"}

{"id": "2054789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054789", "title": "Fengu people", "text": "Fengu people\n\nThe Fengu people (in the Xhosa language \"Mfengu\" and plural \"amafengu\") refers to a variety of ethnic groups that fled from the Mfecane to enter into various Xhosa speaking areas, but now often considered to have assimilated by the Xhosa people whose language they now speak. The term derives from the verb \"ukumfenguza\" which means to wander about seeking service. Historically they achieved considerable renown for their military ability in the frontier wars.\n\nThey were previously known as the \"Fingo\" people, and they gave their name to the district of Fingoland, the southwestern portion of Transkei, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.\n\nThe name \"amaFengu\" translates as \"wanderers\" and the Fengu people – like the Bhaca, Bhele, Hlubi and Dlamini peoples – was formed from the tribes that were broken up and dispersed by Shaka and his Zulu armies in the Mfecane wars.\n\nMost of them fled westwards and settled amongst the Xhosa. After some years of oppression by the Gcaleka Xhosa (who called the Fengu people their \"dogs\")in the 1820s, they formed an alliance with the Cape government in 1835 and Sir Benjamin d'Urban invited 17 000 to settle on the banks of the Great Fish River in the region that later became known as the Ciskei.\nSome scholars, including Timothy Stapleton and Alan Webster, argue that the traditional narrative of the Fengu people as refugees of the Mfecane is in fact a lie constructed by colonial missionaries and administrators. They question the existence of the Fengu people as a distinct group prior to colonial contact, instead positing that the term was given, by the British, to a collection of Xhosa defectors, migrant laborers, and labor captives.\n\nThey subsequently became notable allies of the Cape Colony in the frontier wars against their former oppressors. In this capacity, they won several victories against their Xhosa enemies (particularly the Gcaleka Xhosa), and through shrewd and successful management of regional trade, formed a developed and materially successful nation. In addition, many bought farms and started businesses in the small towns that were springing up in that part of the Cape frontier.\n\nThe Fengu people did not take part in the great cattle-killing in 1857, which devastated the Xhosa people.\n\nWhile the Xhosa slaughtered their own cattle and burnt their crops, many of the Fengu people instead bought the Xhosa cattle at very low prices, only to resell them at a profit during the subsequent famine. They also were recorded as producing large excesses of grain at this time for their starving neighbours. The famine induced by the cattle-killing effectively brought much of the armed resistance in the eastern Cape to an end.\n\nOver a decade of relative peace and economic development, which peaked in the mid-1870s, was brought to an end by a series of devastating droughts across the Transkei, which began to place severe strain on intertribal relations. Their severity increased up until 1877, when the last major war that the Fengu people fought, the Ninth Frontier War, broke out after a bar fight between Fengu and Gcaleka guests, at a Fengu wedding. Many Fengu people were Cape citizens by this time, so the Cape Colony took a partisan view of the war, which brought it into conflict with the Gcaleka forces.\n\nThe Cape government appointed the Fengu Captain Bikitsha to co-lead the Cape's forces (composed primarily of Fengu, Thembu and Boer commandos) in the war. They inflicted a string of crushing defeats on the enemy and dispersed their armies in the space of only three weeks. The ingratitude of the British governor Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who promptly humiliated the Cape's Fengu allies by forcibly disarming them, caused the Fengu to begin to identify more with the Xhosa, partly also as a reaction to increasing persecution from the Colonial authorities.\n\nThe Fengu lived in the Bantustans of Transkei and Ciskei, established by the Apartheid government. Ciskei was the scene of political rivalry between the Rharhabe and the Fengu as a result of the apartheid policy of \"retribalisation\", which resulted in resentment toward the historically better educated, and relatively economically advantaged Fengu, and this rivalry culminated in the election of Lennox Sebe, a Rharhabe, who replaced Fengu leader Chief Justice Thandathu Jongilizwe Mabandla in 1973, however Sebe subsequently abandoned his anti-Fengu rhetoric.\n\nChristianity played a major role in the survival of the endangered Fengu people after the Mfecane wars. After contact with the Gcaleka Xhosa, who were hostile towards them, the Fengu people found comfort in Rev. John Ayliff, the missionary at Butterworth who devoted himself to the tribe for the next 30 years. In 1835, Ayliff led 17 000 and 22 000 head of cattle to Peddie On the 14 May 1835, the Fengu people gathered under an old milkwood tree in the Peddie district, in the presence of Rev. John Ayliff, and swore an oath to obey the Queen, to accept Christianity, and to educate their children. This agreement became known as the 'Fingo-Oath'. Soon after accepting Christianity, the Fengu became the first Bantu in South Africa to use ploughs, demonstrated to them by the missionaries, and also the first to plant wheat. A small group moved to Tsitsikamma and carried their Christian customs with them. The Fengu, who were most Wesleyans, soon moved to Grahamstown where they fought on the side of the British in the eighth frontier war of 1850 to 1853 and were rewarded with land in a freehold village known as Fingo in Grahamstown in 1855. The educated Fengu went as far as Port Elizabeth, where they worked at the harbour and established urban communities in Cape Town, where they also continued practising as Christians. Since the day the 'Fingo-Oath' was sworn, the 14 May has been celebrated as Fingo Emancipation Day and a ceremony held under the old milkwood tree where the oath was sworn.\n\nAfter the occupation of Matebeleland in 1893, the Ndebele took up arms in an effort to re-establish the Ndebele State in 1896. Cecil John Rhodes brought a group of Fengu fighters (who had fought on the side of the British) and were derogatively known as \"the Cape Boys\" in 1896. After the war, Rhodes tried further to 'neutralise' the 'war-like' Ndebele people by inviting more Fengu people into Southern Rhodesia. \"He promised the Fengus three 'reserves' on which they could settle with the proviso that each man would work for three months a year. After 36 months of labour, each one would be given an individual title\". More Fengu leaders moved to Southern Rhodesia as Wesleyan Methodists, Salvationists, Anglicans, Presbyterians and Lutherans. In 2000, the Mbembesi Fengu/Xhosa community celebrated their centenary in Zimbabwe. The Fengu in Zimbabwe, who are Xhosa speakers, are the subject of the first ever PHD thesis written in Xhosa by Dr Hleze Kunju titled IsiXhosa ulwimi lwabantu abangesosininzi eZimbabwe: Ukuphila nokulondolozwa kwaso (Xhosa as a Minority Language in Zimbabwe: Survival and Maintenance) \n\nFor much of the 19th and early 20th century, the Fengu were led by Captain Veldtman Bikitsha. Initially a constable who was of great service to the Cape in the 8th Frontier War, he was later promoted and served as a de facto military leader of the Cape's Fengu commandos.\n\nPrime Minister John Molteno, who held a very high opinion of Bikitsha, appointed him as a leader of the Cape forces (together with Chief Magistrate Charles Griffith) in the 9th Frontier War in 1877, where he swiftly won a string of brilliant victories against the Gcaleka. Throughout the 9th Frontier war, Bikitsha and his location were a focal point for the Gcaleka armies attacks and came under immense military pressure.\n\nHis military genius in the frontier wars earned him considerable renown and he was widely acknowledged leader in the Cape Colony. His courage was also frequently referred to. He famously once jumped onto a wounded and charging lion, holding it by the tail, overpowered it and killed it. He was invited to London in 1889, where Queen Victoria requested to meet him to thank him for his services. He reputedly told her \"\"We have never feared a white man, and we have never lifted our hand against any of your people.\"\"\n\nHe founded the Transkei General Council, and served as a juror and commissioner for the Cape Colony in later life\n\nAs Fengu history switched from military defense to political struggle, so the great Fengu politician and activist John Tengo Jabavu rose in prominence after Bikitsha's military leadership ended.\n\nJabavu edited the first newspapers to be written in the Xhosa and from 1876 he edited \"Isigidimi samaXhosa\" (\"The Xhosa Messenger\"). From 1884 he edited \"Imvo Zabantsundu\" (\"Black Opinion\"). He wrote on the threat of Afrikaner nationalism, equal rights for South Africa's black population, and in support of women's rights.\n\nThe rivalry between the Fengu and the Gcaleka Xhosa, which had previously broken out into war, declined during the era of Jabavu's leadership, as greater unity was encouraged. Nonetheless, some divisions remained. Jabavu's main political rival, Walter Rubusana, was Xhosa. Rubusana's rise in the 1890s was through the new Gcaleka-dominated South African Native National Congress and their newspaper \"Izwi Labantu\" (\"The Voice of the People\") which was financed by Cecil Rhodes. The rise of Xhosa institutions meant that Jabavu and the Fengu were no longer in a position to provide the only leadership in the Cape's Black community.\n\nOver the next few decades, divisions persisted between Jabavu's movement \"Imbumba\" (\"The Union\") and Rubusana's South African Native National Congress. However the rivalry was finally laid to rest and there was union under the newly named African National Congress. One of the early aims of this movement was finally to lay to rest \"the aberrations of the Xhosa-Fingo feud.\"\n\nBritish Kaffraria had been annexed to the Cape Colony in 1866. Barring the brief revolt in 1877 and 1878, when the Gcaleka turned upon their Fengu neighbours, the British annexation of land east of the Kei River proceeded fitfully, but generally unimpeded. In September 1879 this was followed by Idutywa Reserve and Fenguland, and Gcalekaland in 1885. It is assumed that the restructuring of these territories into the divisions of Butterworth, Idutywa, Centani, Nqamakwe, Tsomo and Willowvale dates from these times.\n\nOriginally farmers, the Fengu people had quickly built themselves schools, created and edited their own newspapers, and translated international literature into their language. The reason that the Fengu people were able to adapt so effectively to changing circumstances (like the coming of capitalism and urbanisation) was because they lacked a fixed tribal social-structure and hierarchy (having presumably lost it in their earlier flight from the Zulu). This state of social change and flexibility allowed them to quickly adjust to the European expansion, learn and adapt new techniques, and take advantage of the upheavals that followed. Other tribes were often suspicious of outside ideas and consequently resisted any change to meet the colonial threat. The Fengu had no paramount-chief as other tribes did, but the Cape Commander, Veldman Bikitsha, was a Fengu and held authority over the Fengu's military capacity.\n\nMany Fengu have also subsequently intermarried with other ethnic groups, particularly with the Xhosa and Zulu, while some still live in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe region that was later known as the Transkei was originally divided into territories known as the Idutywa Reserve, Fingoland and Galekaland (Gcalekaland). Fingoland lay the borderlands in the far south of the Transkei, just north of the Kei River.\n\nFollowing their annexation by the British however, they were restructured into the divisions of Butterworth, Tsomo and Ngqamakwe for Fingoland; Centani and Willowvale for Galekaland; and Idutywa for the Idutywa Reserve.\n\nToday virtually all the Fengu people have intermarried with other ethnic groups particularly with the Xhosa and Zulu. Many are now often considered – especially by outsiders – to be ethnically Xhosa and others Zulu, because of their common language and some similar customs. A considerable number have a mixed racial background, especially in and around the Cape provinces.\n\n"}

During high school he met Tommy Sickles through mutual friends. Holt, Sickles, and two other friends formed the band Ingredient 17, in which he played guitar and sang. After playing a show with a band known as Nothingface, the two bands became familiar with one another. \n\nHolt died in his Frederick, Maryland, home on April 15, 2017, at the age of 39 after years of battling an undisclosed degenerative illness.\n\nIngredient 17 was later recording in Nothingface bassist Bill Gaal's studio when Nothingface's vocalist, David Gabbard, left the band citing musical differences. One day Holt came in to record a song for Ingredient 17, and the band members of Nothingface liked his voice, so they \"took\" him from his band and got their new singer, Holt, says Tom Maxwell from the forums.\n\nAfter releasing four studio albums – \"Pacifier\", \"An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity\", \"Violence\", and \"Skeletons\" – Nothingface disbanded on February 10, 2004. Shortly after, Holt joined a band called Kingdom of Snakes, formed by Bill Gaal, former bass player of Nothingface. Holt later left the band to pursue other musical routes.\n\nIn December 2005, Nothingface released new music on their website, which revealed that Holt, Maxwell and Sickles had been working together for a while. Joined by Danzig's bass player, Jerry Montano (who played with the band for a while in 2000 after Bill Gaal temporarily left the band), Nothingface began preparing a fifth studio album.\n\nOn May 24, 2008, it was announced through Blabbermouth.net as well as the band's Myspace page that original members Bill Gaal and Chris Houck (percussion) had rejoined Nothingface. Two days later they released \"Nothingface\" in remastered form (released in vinyl at first, the digital download for the entire album came later on April 30, 2009.) This was their very first effort before \"Pacifier\".\n\nIn February 2009, Nothingface reunited in a studio in Baltimore, Maryland. Over the course of a few weeks, they recorded instrumentals for three new songs. Later, Holt entered the studio to lay down vocals for one of the new tracks: \"One Thousand Lies\".\n\nOn August 13, 2009, Maxwell announced he was leaving Nothingface and stated that Holt had not produced material. Hours later Gaal confirmed that the group had split up.\n"}

A similar implementation in which all bits are '1' except one '0' is sometimes called one-cold. In statistics, dummy variables represent a similar technique for representing categorical data.\n\nOne-hot encoding is often used for indicating the state of a state machine. When using binary or Gray code, a decoder is needed to determine the state. A one-hot state machine, however, does not need a decoder as the state machine is in the \"n\"th state if and only if the \"n\"th bit is high.\n\nA ring counter with 15 sequentially ordered states is an example of a state machine. A 'one-hot' implementation would have 15 flip flops chained in series with the Q output of each flip flop connected to the D input of the next and the D input of the first flip flop connected to the Q output of the 15th flip flop. The first flip flop in the chain represents the first state, the second represents the second state, and so on to the 15th flip flop which represents the last state. Upon reset of the state machine all of the flip flops are reset to '0' except the first in the chain which is set to '1'. The next clock edge arriving at the flip flops advances the one 'hot' bit to the second flip flop. The 'hot' bit advances in this way until the 15th state, after which the state machine returns to the first state.\n\nAn address decoder converts from binary or Gray code to one-hot representation.\nA priority encoder converts from one-hot representation to binary or Gray code.\n\nIn natural language processing, a one-hot vector is a 1 × \"N\" matrix (vector) used to distinguish each word in a vocabulary from every other word in the vocabulary. The vector consists of 0s in all cells with the exception of a single 1 in a cell used uniquely to identify the word.\n\n\nUsing a one-hot implementation typically allows a state machine to run at a faster clock rate than any other encoding of that state machine.\n\n\n"}

Wrigley\n\nPhilip Knight Wrigley (December 5, 1894 - April 12, 1977), sometimes also called P.K. or Phil, was an American chewing gum manufacturer and executive in Major League Baseball, inheriting both those roles as the quiet son of his much more flamboyant father, William Wrigley, Jr..\n\nWrigley was born in Chicago. His father died in 1932 elevating Philip's role in the family business. He presided over the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, and also the family hobby, the Chicago Cubs, as owner until his death. He turned over the presidency of his chewing gum company to his son William Wrigley III in 1961, while retaining the presidency of the Cubs.\n\nWhile the gum industry prospered, the Cubs grew less competitive over the decades. After an appearance in the 1945 World Series, they only had seven winning seasons in the next 32 years, including 16 straight losing seasons from 1947 to 1962. They did have a brief flurry of success (although no pennant championship) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Although resisting installing lights at Wrigley Field to donate to the Navy during wartime, he was innovative in other ways. In 1961 he abolished the traditional field management/coaching structure and instead hired a \"College of Coaches\". This anticipated the specialization of coaches that is taken for granted nowadays. His one mistake, however, was not having a manager. Instead, he opted to have the various coaches as a \"head coach.\" Without firm and consistent leadership, the Cubs continued to languish in the standings, despite having Cubs greats Ernie Banks, Ron Santo, and Billy Williams on the roster. Amid constant ridicule from the media and players, he dropped the head coach idea and hired Leo Durocher as the manager in 1966.\n\nDuring World War II, Wrigley founded the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the World War II military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players. The AAGPBL was immortalized in the 1992 film, \"A League of Their Own.\" In the movie, the character of Walter Harvey, a candy bar mogul, is loosely based on Wrigley.\n\nLike his father, P.K. was a strong believer in maximizing media coverage. Starting in the 1920s, the Cubs' games were covered extensively on the radio, sometimes by competing stations at the same time, for minimal fees. In the post-World War II era, when baseball was booming, Wrigley continued this practice, allowing WGN-TV to carry all the home games as well as a significant number of road games. Some owners were aghast at Wrigley's \"giving away the product\", but it paid manifold dividends in the long run, as the evolution of WGN-TV into a superstation developed a truly nationwide fan base for the Cubs, which has resulted in nearly constant sellout crowds at \"Beautiful Wrigley Field\", regardless of the fortunes of the team at a given time.\n\nP.K. was a fairly visible presence with the Cubs in his younger years, but was seldom witnessed attending games during his final few decades of ownership, making his presence known mostly through memos and sometimes full-page newspaper ads. Early 70s utility player Pete LaCock was best known for being the son of TV personality Peter Marshall and for his unique sense of humor. \"The Sporting News\" once reported that he had made a trip to the Wrigley Building and asked for an audience with Mr. Wrigley. P.K. asked him what he wanted, and LaCock answered, \"Nothing. I just wanted to see if you really exist!\"\n\nAfter P.K. died, William III became president of the Cubs as well. Only a few months later, P. K.'s widowed wife died as well, saddling William III with massive estate taxes. William III was forced to sell the Cubs to the Tribune Company in 1981, ending over 60 years of Wrigley association with the team, save the name of the ballpark itself, which remains Wrigley Field.\n\nContinuing the environmental stewardship of his father, he established the Catalina Island Conservancy in 1972, and donated his family's ownership of most of Santa Catalina Island, 26 miles off the coast of Los Angeles, to the Catalina Island Conservancy.\n\nWrigley died on April 12, 1977.\n\n"}

He was the son of tsar Samuel (r. 997–1014). \n\nDuring his father's reign, his cousin Ivan Vladislav and Ivan's entire family were all sentenced by Samuel to death for treason. Gavril's intervention saved at least his cousin. He is said to have saved his father's life in the disastrous defeat of the Battle of Spercheios, and he was described as a gallant fighter.\n\nAround the same time that Emperor Basil II captured the bulk of Samuel's army, Gavril and his forces defeated the army of Theophylact Botaneiates. Having inherited Samuel's war with the Byzantine Empire, Gavril Radomir raided Byzantine territory, reaching as far as Constantinople. However, the Byzantines secured the assistance of Ivan Vladislav, who owed his life to Radomir. Vladislav murdered Radomir while hunting near Ostrovo, and then took the throne for himself.\n\nSome sources connect Gavril Radomir with the medieval dualist sect, Bogomilism, a popular heretic movement that flourished in the region of Macedonia during his and his father's reign. Gavril married twice. His possible son Peter Delyan played a role in attempting to secure independence for Bulgaria several decades later.\n\nIan Mladjov inferred that Agatha, the wife of Edward the Exile, was granddaughter of Agatha Cryselia, daughter of Gavril Radomir, by his short-lived first marriage to a Hungarian princess thought to have been the daughter of Duke Géza of Hungary.

He went 23–7 with eight shutouts and a 1.68 ERA. He also won a game in the 1907 World Series, and the Cubs won their first title. In 1908, Overall \"slumped\" to just 15 wins but also won twice in the 1908 World Series as Chicago repeated as champions. In that Series, Overall set a Cubs record for most strikeouts in a World Series game by a single pitcher (10), which has stood for 108 years. In the series-clinching game, he shut out the Detroit Tigers on three hits. In the first inning of that game, he became the first pitcher to strike out four hitters in one inning in a playoff game, a feat not duplicated until 2013 by Aníbal Sánchez of the Detroit Tigers. In 1909, he won 20 games and set a career-low in ERA (1.42). He also led the NL in strikeouts, with 205.\n\nOverall retired after the 1910 season. He made a brief comeback in 1913. He played seven years in the major leagues in total, compiling a record of 108–71 with a 2.23 lifetime ERA. He was the vice-president and manager of a bank after his baseball career ended.\n\nOverall died at the age of 66 in Fresno, California and was buried at the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\n\n"}
{"id": "2054844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054844", "title": "Jamal Crawford", "text": "Jamal Crawford\n\nAaron Jamal Crawford (born March 20, 1980) is an American professional basketball player who played last for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has also played for the Bulls, Knicks, Warriors, Hawks, Blazers, Clippers, and Timberwolves. Crawford is regarded as one of the best ball handlers in NBA history; and he is, along with Lou Williams, the only three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year winner. \n\nAmong other distinctions, Crawford remains the NBA all-time leader in four-point plays. On April 9, 2019, he became not only the oldest player to score 50+ points in an NBA game, but also the first player to have 50-point outings with four different franchises. The 51-point tally also reached the most points ever scored by a reserve. In NBA history, Crawford ranks 21st with four 50+ point games accrued (tied with 9 others among George Mikan and Larry Bird) and 8th in career three-point field goals made (2,220). Crawford is the second player in NBA history to have scored 10,000+ career points off the bench.\n\nGrowing up in Seattle, Crawford played for Rainier Beach High, a school that has produced a number of other NBA and college players such as Doug Christie, Nate Robinson, Terrence Williams, Kevin Porter Jr., and Dejounte Murray. Jamal led the Vikings to capture the 1998 Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) State Championship. In 2001, Rainier Beach retired his number 23 jersey to commemorate his impact; and in 2018, it inducted him into its Hall of Fame to honor his legacy.\n\nHaving earned a scholarship to the University of Michigan, Crawford committed to play college basketball with the Wolverines under coach Brian Ellerbe. At the start of the 1999–2000 season, however, he incurred a six-game suspension from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA); it retroactively ruled that his high school living arrangement had breached its bylaws on amateurism. The controversial ruling was protested by the university, although to no avail. After the suspension, Crawford joined the starting lineup and went on to averaged 16.6 points, 4.5 assists, and 2.8 rebounds on the season. Following his freshman campaign, he declared for the 2000 NBA draft.\n\nCrawford was selected 8th overall in the 2000 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers but was then traded to the Chicago Bulls in a draft-day deal that included the rights to Chris Mihm. In his first year as a Bull, in 200–01, Crawford struggled with his shot, converting only 35.2 percent from the field. Even so, the rookie was able to score in double-digits 10 times. He averaged 4.6 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 2.3 assists across 61 games (8 starting).\n\nIn his second NBA season, 2002–03, injury limited Crawford to 23 games (6 starting). Nevertheless, he improved across nearly all statistical categories by averaging 9.3 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 2.4 assists as well as by converting 44.8 percent of his attempts from behind the arc.\n\nIn his third campaign with the Bulls, 2003–04, Crawford emerged as a key component of coach Bill Cartwright's offense. His per-game averages improved further to 10.7 points, 2.3 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and 1 steal across 80 games (31 starting). The Bulls would miss the playoffs with a 30-52 record.\n\nHis fourth NBA season, 2004-05, would be his last in Chicago. Promoted to starting shooting guard, Crawford averaged 17.3 points, 3.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per contest. On April 11, 2004, he came away with 50 points against the Toronto Raptors in his third to last game as a Bull. The Bulls won in overtime, 114-108, but not before Crawford made 6 three-pointers and recorded 24 points in the fourth quarter alone. Before the start of the 2004–05 season, he was traded, along with Jerome Williams, to the New York Knicks in exchange for Dikembe Mutombo, Othella Harrington, Frank Williams, and Cezary Trybanski.\n\nCrawford joined another young and rebuilding team in the New York Knicks. In his first year with the franchise, the 2004–05 season, he played 70 games (67 starting) and averaged 17.7 points, 2.9 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.4 steals per contest. His scoring exceeded 20 points in many games, to include a notable win over the Charlotte Bobcats on December 4 where he had 41 points on 17-of-25 shooting. The Knicks would fall short of the playoffs.\n\nIn his second year in New York City, the 2005–06 season, he took a reduced sixth man role under head coach Larry Brown. Though it took some time, Crawford ended up embracing the new role. He average 14.3 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 3.8 assists across 79 games (27 starting). The Knicks, with a record of 23-59, fell short of the playoffs.\n\nDeciding to go in a new direction in 2006–07, the Knicks replaced Larry Brown with Isiah Thomas as head coach, the team's fourth replacement of that position in three years. Crawford was limited to 59 games (36 starting) due to an ACL injury; but he averaged 17.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 4.4 assists on the season.\n\nIn 2007–08, he was put back in the starting lineup for all 80 games that he played. He averaged 20.6 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 5 assists. Crawford provided the 23-59 Knicks with one of the few bright spots on January 26, 2007: He scored a career-high 52 points, with 16 of his shots being made consecutively and 8 of his three-pointers being one short of the franchise record set in 2002 by Latrell Sprewell.\n\nIn 2008–09, he would play only 11 games for the Knicks before being dealt to the Golden State Warriors in a trade for Al Harrington.\n\nCrawford proved an ideal fit in the run-and-gun offense of coach Don Nelson due to his three-point shooting and ball-handling ability as well as court-vision. He played in 54 games for the Warriors in 2008-09 and started in each one. Crawford averaged nearly 20 points per contest as well as 4.4 assists and 1.5 rebounds. During a 110–103 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on December 20, 2008, Crawford scored 50 points; thus he became the fourth player in NBA history—after only Wilt Chamberlain, Bernard King, and Moses Malone—to score 50+ points with three different teams. At the end of the season, the Atlanta Hawks acquired Crawford in a trade for guards Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\nCrawford joined the Atlanta Hawks for their 2009–10 season. On January 15, he made a three-point shot at the buzzer to clinch a 102-101 victory over the Phoenix Suns. In a win over the Los Angeles Clippers on February 3, 2010, Crawford set an all-time NBA record for most career four-point plays, surpassing Reggie Miller. Backing up All-Star guard Joe Johnson and Mike Bibby, he averaged 18 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2 assists off the bench. Crawford was a leading candidate for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award and won the award in 2010. The Hawks, led by Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Horford, Mike Bibby, as well as by Crawford, qualified for the playoffs; this clinching was to be his first trip to the playoffs. The Hawks would advance past the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games. Crawford led all scorers in the decisive game seven with 22 points. The team was subsequently swept by the Orlando Magic with a prime Dwight Howard at its helm. \n\nIn the 2010–11 season, the Hawks fired coach Mike Woodson to bring on Larry Drew. Though Crawford was coming off the bench and saw his averages decline from 2009–10, he had a solid season of averaging 14.2 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game. He was yet again in consideration for the Sixth Man of the Year Award. Having made it to the playoffs as the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference, the Hawks beat the Orlando Magic in a close series, but not before Crawford made the game-clinching three-pointer with six seconds left in Game 3. Thus the Hawks advanced to the conference semifinals, though they were then eliminated by the Chicago Bulls in six games.\n\nCrawford signed with the Portland Trail Blazers on December 15, 2011. He averaged nearly 14 points in 60 games while leading the league in free throw percentage with a career-high 92.7 percent in the lockout-shortened season.\n\nOn July 11, 2012, Crawford signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.\nIn the 2012–13 season, Crawford posted 16.5 points, 1.7 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 29.3 minutes in the 76 games he played. He also finished 2nd place in voting for the 2013 NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, edged out by J. R. Smith. In the opening round of the playoffs, the Clippers were defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies in six games. During the playoffs that year, he averaged 10.8 points, 2 rebounds, and 1.7 assists.\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Crawford led the league's reserve players in scoring with 18.6 points per contest to go along with 3.2 assists and 2.3 rebounds. He came off the bench in 45 of 69 games he played in.\n\nOn May 8, 2014, Crawford won the 2014 NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, his second time of winning the honor. Crawford also led all NBA reserves in scoring that season with 18.6 points per game and helped the Clippers finish with their best record in franchise history (57–25).\n\nOn December 8, 2014, during the last quarter of a game against the Phoenix Suns that the Clippers clinched 121–120 in overtime, Crawford was called for a loose ball foul after getting tangled with Suns' guard Eric Bledsoe at midcourt. Upon saying something to referee Mark Lindsay, Crawford received a technical, along with his first-ever ejection in his 976-game career.\n\nDuring a win over the Phoenix Suns on November 2, 2015, Crawford became the third shooting guard in NBA history to reach 16,000 points. On November 14, he scored a game-high 37 points in a 101–96 victory over the Detroit Pistons. On January 10, 2016, he recorded his 46th four-point play of his career in a 114–111 overtime win over the New Orleans Pelicans. On April 8, 2016, he made a three-pointer with 0.2 seconds left and finished with 30 points in the Clippers' 102–99 overtime victory over the Utah Jazz. On April 19, he was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year for the third time in his career. At 36 years old, he broke his own record, set in 2014, as the oldest winner of the award.\n\nCrawford re-signed with the Clippers on July 8, 2016. By making two of four three-pointers against the New Orleans Pelicans on December 2, 2016, Crawford (1,962) passed Vince Carter (1,961) for No. 6 on the NBA's all-time list for made three-pointers. With a three-pointer at the 2:06 mark of the second quarter in the Clippers' 118–109 loss to the Toronto Raptors on February 6, 2017, Crawford became the sixth NBA player to reach 2,000 made three-pointers. He joined Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Jason Terry, Vince Carter and Paul Pierce in the 2000 club. During the game, he also passed Eddie Johnson for No. 2 in career NBA bench scoring. His tally of 9,572 bench points trails only Dell Curry's 11,147. He also surpassed Magic Johnson for 74th in career points scored. On February 11 against Charlotte, he scored 22 points while shooting 5-of-8 on three-pointers. Crawford (2,009) subsequently passed Vince Carter (2,006) for fifth-most three-pointers made in NBA history.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, the Clippers traded Crawford and a 2018 first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks as part of a salary dump that cleared the way to acquire Danilo Gallinari from the Denver Nuggets by a sign-and-trade deal. The Hawks waived Crawford the following day.\n\nOn July 19, 2017, Crawford signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Debuting for the Timberwolves during their season-opener on October 18, 2017, Crawford scored 10 points in a 107–99 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Two days later, he scored all 17 of his points in the fourth quarter and made a 3-pointer with 27.5 seconds left to help the Timberwolves hold off the Utah Jazz 100–97 in their home-opener. During a 108–107 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on December 18, 2017, Crawford made a season-high 23 points in only 23 minutes, with 16 of them scored in the fourth quarter. On March 30, 2018, he had a 24-point effort in a 93–92 win over the Dallas Mavericks. In June 2018, Crawford won the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award.\n\nCrawford signed with the Phoenix Suns on October 17, 2018. During a 128–110 victory over the New York Knicks on December 17, Crawford dished out a career-high 14 assists. On January 6, 2019, in a 119–113 loss to the Charlotte Hornets, he finished with 16 points to join Dell Curry as the only NBA players to record 11,000+ career points as a reserve. Per 36 minutes in the 2018–19 season, Crawford averaged 15.1 points to go along with a career-high of 6.8 assists. In league history, only John Stockton has averaged more assists per 36 minutes in their 19th or later season.  \n\nOn April 9, 2019, in a 120–109 season finale loss to the Dallas Mavericks, Crawford made NBA history by recording 51 points in his fourth 50-point game to date. At 39 years old and 20 days, he thus broke two NBA records: the oldest player to tally 50+ points—held by Michael Jordan at 38 years and 315 days since December 29, 2001—as well as the most points scored by a player not in the starting lineup, held by Nick Anderson with 50 points since April 23, 1993. During the game, Crawford shot 18-of-30 (60%) from the field, 7-of-13 (53.8%) from three-point range, and 8-of-9 (88.9%) from the free-throw line. He also had 5 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 steal, and 1 block coming off the bench. Down by as much as 31 in the third quarter, he rallied Phoenix back into the game, scoring 12 points in succession and bringing the score to 107-103 with 3:39 minutes left in the game. By scoring 28 and 27 points in the previous two games, Crawford joined Kobe Bryant as the only players in league history to record three consecutive 25+ point games in their 19th or later season.\n\nCrawford married his long-time girlfriend Tori Lucas on August 23, 2014. Among those to attend his wedding were Clippers teammates Blake Griffin, Matt Barnes, Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan, and Spencer Hawes; also in attendance were NBA players Nate Robinson, a fellow Seattleite, and Isaiah Thomas, likewise from the Puget Sound area.\n\nA staple of the Seattle basketball community, Crawford has organized secret workouts around the city, recruiting a revolving cast of elite-level participants that include the likes of Zach LaVine and Kyrie Irving. Part of his legacy has been as a benefactor to his hometown. Among other charitable community activities, Crawford provides a platform for local players aspiring to progress from amateur status to professional through \"The Crawsover\" league. This Pro–am summer-league at Seattle Pacific University is among the most prestigious in the country, yet admission is free. Pros such as NBA All-Stars Chris Paul and Kevin Durant have participated in the past.\n\n"}
{"id": "2054854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054854", "title": "Justin Kaplan", "text": "Justin Kaplan\n\nJustin Daniel \"Joe\" Kaplan (September 5, 1925 in Manhattan, New York City – March 2, 2014 in Cambridge, Massachusetts) was an American writer and editor. The general editor of \"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations\" (16th and 17th eds.), he was best known as a biographer, particularly of Samuel Clemens, Lincoln Steffens, and Walt Whitman.\n\nKaplan was born to a Orthodox Jewish family in Manhattan, the son of Tobias D. Kaplan, a successful shirt manufacturer in New York City, and Anna (Rudman) Kaplan, a homemaker. Both of his parents died by the time he was nine. “I spent a lot of time as a boy playing in Central Park and walking around Manhattan by myself,” he recalled in a 1981 \"Boston Globe\" interview. His parents died when he was young and he was raised by an older brother and the family’s West Indian housekeeper, who taught him to cook, which later came in handy when his wife Anne Bernays turned out to be a self-described “domestic illiterate”.\n\nA top student, Kaplan entered Harvard University at age 16, receiving his bachelor's in English in 1944. After pursuing a post-graduate degree in English for two years, he grew dissatisfied with graduate school and moved to New Mexico. “The openness and the beauty of the Southwest,” he said in the 1981 interview, “made me aware of American writers in a way I had never considered before.”\n\nHe then began to work as an editor for the publishing house Simon & Schuster, where after eight years he rose to senior editor, becoming known as \"the house brain\", handling brainier authors including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, \"\"Zorba the Greek\"\" author Nikos Kazantzakis, and sociologist C. Wright Mills. Fascinated by words and language, by his early 20s Kapalan had edited translations of Plato and Aristotle. In his memoir \"Back Then\" (2002) Kaplan wrote: \"It was fun to work at Simon & Schuster. [It was] not surprising to see editors staying long after hours to talk books, trade industry gossip, and joke over office bottles of Scotch and gin. In the days before it was absorbed into a conglomerate the house was like a summer camp for intellectually hyperactive children\", only without a curfew, reminiscing about dancing at a party with Marilyn Monroe, “gently kneading the little tire of baby fat around her waist.”\n\nIn 1953 while an editor at art book publisher Harry Abrams, he met Anne Bernays (b. 1930), daughter of public relations pioneer Edward L. Bernays and writer Doris E. Fleischman, and great-niece of Sigmund Freud. They married in 1954. Soon after he was invited by M. Lincoln \"Max\" Schuster, co-founder of Simon & Schuster to help acquire \"better books\", seek out younger authors, and \"deal diplomatically\" with established names.\n\nIn 1959 Kaplan saw Hal Holbrook's celebrated stage performance of Mark Twain, causing him to become fascinated with Twain, reading everything he could by and about him then writing a 10-page proposal complete with his own contract, which was accepted by Simon & Schuster complete with a $4,000 advance, causing him to leave publishing for writing, despite the anxiety caused by leaving a well-paying job for the uncertainty of a writer's life. Needing distance from the \"adrenaline-intoxicated style\" of New York, and needing access to Harvard's Widener Library, he and Anne moved to Massachusetts, where he remained for the rest of his life, living in Cambridge, Massachusetts in a 16-room house on Francis Avenue, where \"Anne and Joe\" became the center of a literary social circle at the heart of 02138, the Harvard Square ZIP code, with neighbors including French chef Julia Child and Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith. Said novelist James Carroll: “If there’s a writer’s community in Boston, they established it. There was a period of about 15 years when their house was the center of the writing life in Boston. Joe was the pillar, and Anne was the flame. Between the two of them they made a big difference in the life of the city.”\n\nIn 1973 they built a home in Truro, Massachusetts in the Outer Cape.\n\nKaplan's first book \"Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain\" (1966) was a critical success, winning both the National Book Award in category Arts and Letters and the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. A stylish account of the Missouri-born humorist who attempted imperfectly to fit in with the Eastern elite, it was immediately praised as a landmark in Twain scholarship, making fans of E.L. Doctorow, Tom Wolfe et al. and becoming a standard biography. It “employed an organizing device, unusual for its day, to which Mr. Kaplan would return. Instead of arranging his subject’s life chronologically, he portrayed it out of sequence, opening the book with Twain at 31.”\n\nKaplan brought out the psychic split in Clemens' personality implied by the name Mark Twain, a Missouri-raised Westerner who enjoyed all the Eastern comforts of the Gilded Age. \"He was bound to be tormented by the distinction and the split, always invidious, between performing humorist and man of letters, and he had no way of reconciling the two... S.L. Clemens of Hartford dreaded to meet the obligations of Mark Twain, the traveling lecturer.\" \"To the end he remained as much an enigma and prodigy to himself as he was to the thousands at the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York who filed past the casket, topped with a single wreath of laurel, where he lay in a white suit.\" (last line)\n\nThomas Lask wrote that \"Not in years has there been a biography in which the complexities of human character have been exposed with such perceptiveness, with such a grasp of their contradictory nature, with such ability to keep each strand clear and yet make it contribute to the overall fabric.\"\n\nIn 1974 Kaplan published \"Mark Twain and His World\", a pictorial biography.\n\nKaplan followed \"Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain\" with two more well-received biographies, \"\" (1974) and \"\" (1980), which won a National Book Award in category Autobiography/Biography.\n\nIn 2006 Kaplan published \"\", about the Astor family and the Gilded Age. He also edited several anthologies.\n\nIn 1988 after planned biographies of Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant and acting legend Charlie Chaplin fell through, Kaplan took a job as general editor of \"Bartlett’s Familiar Quoations\" to update the 15th (1980) edition, “a job akin to running the admissions committee of the most selective college in the world\" (\"New York Times\"), which he was ideally suited for, editing the 16th and 17th editions (1992, 2002). “It’s every writer’s dream,” he said in a 1990 \"Boston Globe\" interview. “Every day, I look over my shoulder because I have the sense people think I’m goofing off.” No goof-off, Kaplan began reading through all 25,000 quotations, weeding out some 3,500 obscure or unmemorable quotations from forgotten 19th century poets et al. and replacing them with more recent quotations from Elvis Presley, Norman Mailer, Noam Chomsky (“Colorless green ideas sleep furiously”) Erich Segal (“Love means never having to say you're sorry”), musicians including James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, and Michael Jackson, feminists including Susan Brownmiller (“Man’s discovery that his genitalia could serve as a weapon to generate fear must rank as one of the most important discoveries of prehistoric times, along with the use of fire and the first crude stone axe”), Erica Jong, and Germaine Greer (“Is it too much to ask that women be spared the daily struggle for superhuman beauty in order to offer it to the caresses of a subhumanly ugly mate?”), leftists including Philip Caputo (“You’re going to learn that one of the most brutal things in the world is your average nineteen-year-old American boy”) and Toni Morrison (“At no point in my life have I ever felt as though I were American”),\nnovelists including Milan Kundera, Chinua Achebe, and Anthony Burgess, entertainment figures including Garrison Keillor, Mel Brooks, Monty Python's Flying Circus, \"Sesame Street\" (“Me want a cookie”), and Woody Allen (Sex - “It’s the most fun I’ve ever had without laughing”), and films including \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (“ET phone home”), and \"Apocalypse Now\" (“I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory.”).\n\nThe 1992 16th edition deleted 245 authors and added 340 new ones, along with 1,600 new quotations. The back cover lists 10 quotations selected from the more than 20,000 found inside, by Gloria Steinem, Steve Biko, Grace Slick, and fans of \"Star Trek\". One contemporary critique argued that it neglected conservative voices and many parts \"read like the liberal Left's Hall of Fame”.\n\n“You can’t do it systematically. You do it associatively. One thing reminds you of another thing. You have to see whether it is not only quotable, but whether it has been quoted. I’m not doing an anthology of literary gems, but trying to find out what people have been quoting, what is stuck in their minds.”\n\nKaplan was criticized for discounting the eloquence of President Ronald Reagan, whom he purposely kept out of the 1992 edition, later admitting \"I'm not going to disguise the fact that I despise Ronald Reagan\", and \"[He] could not be described as a memorable phrase maker\" but was really only \"an actor masquerading as a leader\". Bowing to the critics, he included in the 2002 edition Reagan’s memorable 1987 demand during a speech at the Brandenburg Gate near the Berlin Wall: “Tear down this wall!”\n\nJoe and Anne wrote a double memoir \"The Language of Names\" (1997), and \"\" (2002), in which they referred to themselves as \"children of privilege\" who went to progressive schools and were \"grounded in a classical approach to education — a lot of memorizing and Shakespeare, an exhaustive approach to history, literature, and the sciences.\"\n\nKaplan died at the age of 88 on March 2, 2014. He had been suffering for years from Parkinson's disease. He left a wife and three daughters, Susanna Kaplan Donahue, Hester Margaret Kaplan Stein, and Polly Anne Kaplan Tigges, and six grandchildren, including the notable Rachel Tigges.\n\nHe belonged to the Massachusetts Historical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Close friends included biographer Larry Tye.\n\nIn 2002 he was interviewed by National Public Radio's \"Fresh Air\", explaining his thought process at Bartlett's.\n\n"}

The year of his birth is unknown; he was born at least a decade before 987, but probably not much earlier than that.\n\nSaved from death by his cousin Gavril Radomir, the Bulgarian Emperor, in 976, Ivan Vladislav murdered him in October 1015 and seized the Bulgarian throne. Due to the desperate situation of the country following the decades-long war with the Byzantine Empire, and in an attempt to consolidate his position, he tried to negotiate truce with the Byzantine emperor Basil II. After the failure of the negotiations he continued the resistance, attempting unsuccessfully to push the Byzantines back. During his period of rule, Ivan Vladislav tried to strengthen the Bulgarian army, reconstructed many Bulgarian fortresses and even carried out a counter-offensive, but he died at the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1018. After his death his widow, Empress Maria, the Patriarch and most of the nobility finally surrendered to Basil II, who soon suppressed the last remnants of resistance and brought about the end of the First Bulgarian Empire.\n\nIvan Vladislav left a mixed heritage, varying from a reputation of being a ruthless murderer to a hero defending his country as best as he could. The descendants of Ivan Vladislav entered the Byzantine nobility and rose to the highest ranks of the hierarchy. Two women of his family became empresses of the Byzantine Empire and others became military commanders or high-ranking officials. He was an ancestor of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos.\n\nIvan Vladislav was the son of Aron, the brother of Emperor Samuel (r. 997–1014) of the Cometopuli dynasty. In 976 or 987 Samuel ordered his brother Aron executed for treason together with his entire family near Razmetanitsa. Ivan Vladislav was the only survivor, being spared through the intercession of his cousin, Samuel's son Gavril Radomir. His life during the subsequent decades and until his accession is unknown.\n\nBy 1015, Bulgaria had been embroiled in almost thirty years of war with the Byzantine Empire, and Gavril Radomir had succeeded Samuel, who died on 6 October 1014 after the disastrous Battle of Kleidion. However, from the outset Radomir's position was insecure: Ivan Vladislav, as a son of the elder of the Cometopouli brothers, could lay claim on the throne based on seniority. During that time the Byzantine Emperor Basil II campaigned deep into Bulgarian territory. He retook the previously lost town of Voden (Edessa) and laid siege to the massive fortress of Maglen, situated to the north-west. Gavril Radomir did not have enough forces and was unable to interfere and could only watch the course of the events from the nearby Lake Ostrovo. His inability to cope with the Byzantine threat aroused discontent among the nobility and Ivan Vladislav became their chosen leader. The fall of Maglen sealed Gavril Radomir's fate—in the late summer of 1015, while hunting near Ostrovo (Arnissa), he was murdered by his cousin, perhaps at the behest of Byzantine agents. Ivan Vladislav then seized the Bulgarian throne and took steps to ensure his position against potential rivals.\n\nAfter assuming the throne, Ivan Vladislav immediately sent a delegation to Basil II, which arrived five days after the fall of Maglen. In his letter, Ivan Vladislav notified Basil that he had personally murdered Gavril Radomir and had seized all the power in the country and promised Basil deep humility and obedience, an act of submission which some in the nobility supported. After Ivan Vladislav firmly secured his hold on the throne, however, he openly declared to be against any kind of compromise with the Byzantines and quickly began to follow the determined policy of his predecessors against the ongoing Byzantine conquest. Basil II soon understood that Ivan Vladislav's letter was a ruse and plotted a retaliatory action, bribing the \"kavkhan\" Theodore, who was in Byzantine captivity, to murder the Bulgarian ruler. Theodore in turn paid a trusted man in Ivan Vladislav's employ to commit the murder, but in the event the assassin actually killed Theodore himself. In the meantime Basil II continued his march, forcing the Bulgarian emperor to retreat to the Albanian mountains, and advanced into the heart of the Bulgarian state. The Byzantines took the capital Ohrid and burned the imperial palaces; news, however, arrived that Ivan Vladislav had laid siege to Dyrrhachium and that to the south the Bulgarian general Ibatzes had defeated the Byzantine rear army near Bitola. With his supply routes cut, Basil II had to retreat back to Thessalonica leaving a small garrison in Ohrid, which was swiftly retaken by the Bulgarians. Back in his base at Mosynopolis, Basil divided the Byzantine army to harass the areas of Strumitsa and Sofia. In January 1016 the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople.\n\nMeanwhile, Ivan Vladislav consolidated his positions in the mountains of Albania and Macedonia. As early as October 1015 he began the reconstruction of many strongholds destroyed during the war, including the fortress at Bitola (as testified in the Bitola inscription). In 1016 he invited his vassal Prince Jovan Vladimir of Doclea, who was married to Gabriel Radomir's sister Theodora Kosara, to come to his court. The emperor probably desired to seize the prince and so secure his western flank. The Prince was determined to attend the invitation of Tsar, but his wife Theodora Kosara did not trust the murderer of her brother, and fearing for her husband's life persuaded him not to go. Ivan Vladislav however vowed not to threaten his vassal's life, and sent him a golden cross as a proof of good will. Jovan Vladimir still hesitated, saying that God was nailed to a wooden not golden cross, but Ivan Vladislav repeated his vow and gave him a guarantee of safe-conduct, also guaranteed by the Bulgarian patriarch David. Eventually Jovan Vladimir travelled to the court of the Tsar in Prespa, but upon his arrival on 22 May, he was immediately beheaded, and the emperor refused to allow the burial of his body. It was not until a number of miraculous events related to the corpse of the prince were observed that Vladislav returned the body to Kosara.\n\nIn the spring of 1016 Basil II led his armies along the Struma valley and besieged the strong fortress of Pernik. The fort's defence was headed by the capable commander Krakra, who remained loyal to the Bulgarian cause. As all the previous attempts against Pernik, the 88-day siege was a failure, costing the Byzantines many casualties before they were forced to retreat south and regroup at Mosynopolis.\n\nIn the early days of 1017 the Byzantine emperor renewed his campaigns. He sent David Arianites and Constantine Diogenes to pillage along the River Vardar and captured the castle of Longos. After that he marched south and besieged Kastoria. Under the walls of the town Basil II received messages from Tzitzikios, the Byzantine \"strategos\" of Dorostolon (Silistra), that Ivan Vladislav had sent Krakra to negotiate assistance from the Pechenegs and that they were crossing the Danube. The Byzantine emperor immediately abandoned the siege and hurried northwards, but in the vicinity of Lake Ostrovo he learned that the Pechenegs were unwilling to risk war. Returning south, Basil II captured Setina, where Samuel used to have a palace and acquired for himself the large amount of provisions that were stored there. Ivan Vladislav, who was closely monitoring the Byzantine movements, ambushed the troops who were under the command of Constantine Diogenes, who would have perished had not Basil II come to relieve him. According to John Skylitzes, the Emperor charged alone in front of his army to Diogenes' rescue. When the Bulgarians saw him, they shouted \"Run, the Emperor\" (\"\") and retreated in panic. Contented with their victory, the Byzantines moved on to Voden and returned to Constantinople.\n\nIn the early 1018 Ivan Vladislav besieged Dyrrhachium, but in February he was killed under the walls of the city. The accounts of his death are contradictory. According to some he became victim of a plot and was killed by his servants; according to others, he perished in battle. The Bulgarian additions to the Skylitzes Chronicle are more detailed, saying that Ivan Vladislav dueled with the \"strategos\" of Dyrrhachium, the \"patrikios\" Niketas Pegonites, on horseback, and while fighting, two Byzantine infantrymen from the audience rushed to the emperor and wounded him mortally in the belly. A later Byzantine historian claimed that the duel was fair and Pegonites stabbed Ivan Vladislav in the chest with his spear, killing him instantly. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja reports an altogether different story: while having a meal in his camp, the emperor was attacked by an unknown soldier, in whom Ivan Vladislav seemed to have recognized the murdered Jovan Vladimir. Terrified, he cried for help but no one rushed to his rescue and the unknown soldier mortally wounded the Bulgarian ruler.\n\nHis death marked the effective end of the Bulgarian Empire. Ivan Vladislav's sons were young and inexperienced, and even the strongest Bulgarian leaders doubted the advisability of further resistance. Upon learning of the death of the Tsar, Basil II left Constantinople. In Adrianople he was met by the brother of Krakra who acknowledged Byzantine authority. His example was followed by the larger part of the Bulgarian nobility who pledged loyalty to Basil II, giving up their fortresses. In Serres, Krakra along with the commanders of 35 castles met the emperor and surrendered, and in Strumitsa he received a message sent by the Empress-dowager Maria to negotiate the surrender of the capital and the country. Basil II richly awarded those who surrendered, allowing them to keep their lands, wealth and titles. Short-lived resistance continued under Ivan Vladislav's eldest son Presian and his brothers, but they also surrendered by the end of 1018.\n\nLiving more than one hundred years after Ivan Vladislav, the historian known as the Priest of Duklja, who wrote from a Dukljan perspective, was outraged by the murder of Jovan Vladimir, and wrote that after the Tsar died, he was \"forever connected with the angels of Satan\". Many modern Bulgarian historians, including Vasil Zlatarski, also criticize the emperor, claiming that his actions hastened the fall of Bulgaria and that instead of raising the morale of the nation he turned into a murderer and was unable to cope with the intrigues and the corruption in court. Steven Runciman is also critical of the emperor, noting that his assassination of Gavril Radomir unleashed a general confusion where each noble started looking out for his own personal interests, but nevertheless credits him with \"a considerable ruthless energy\". Jordan Andreev is more favourable to Ivan Vladislav, noting that he had reasons for his acts—he had to revenge the murder of his family according to the old Bulgarian pagan beliefs, but he only killed Gavril Radomir and his wife without harming the rest of Gavril Radomir's family. He had to cope with Jovan Vladimir who, as a husband of one of Samuel's daughters, was a threat to his position, and had also attempted a compromise with the Byzantines. According to Andreev, Ivan Vladislav's struggle to defend the Bulgarian state and his heroic death serve to mitigate his ill deeds. He cites a Byzantine historian who claimed that during Ivan Vladislav's reign the Byzantine state \"hanged in the balance, because that barbarian like Goliath resisted the Romans and they were all despaired by that invincible foe.\" The Polish historian Kazimierz Zakrzewski also writes with sympathy for the last ruler of the First Empire, in light of the fact that Ivan Vladislav managed to sustain a guerilla war which he skilfully ran until his death.\n\nIvan Vladislav Point on Rugged Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria.\n\nIvan Vladislav married Maria, possibly the daughter of Tsar Boris II of Bulgaria and a Byzantine noblewoman, by whom he left progeny. Maria was named \"zoste patrikia\" by Basil II, and the descendants of Ivan Vladislav entered Byzantine service, becoming part of the Byzantine nobility and forming close ties with the Komnenos clan in particular. Both his daughter Catherine and an unnamed (possibly Anna) granddaughter married (future) Byzantine emperors. His second son Alusian took part in the Uprising of Petar Delyan against Byzantine rule but eventually betrayed the Bulgarian cause.\n\nMaria and Ivan Vladislav had several children, including:\n\n\n"}

Trio's main principle was to remove almost all the ornamentation and polish from their songs, and to use the simplest practical structures (most of their songs were three-chord songs). For this reason, many of their songs are restricted to drums, guitar, vocals, and just one or maybe two other instruments, if any at all. Bass was used very infrequently until their later songs, and live shows often saw Remmler playing some simple pre-programmed rhythms and melodies on his small Casio VL-1 keyboard while Behrens played his drums with one hand and ate an apple with the other.

It is also popular in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan, consisting of stir-fried cubes of radish cake.\n\nIt is also known as \"fried carrot cake\" or simply \"carrot cake\" in Southeast Asian countries, as the word for daikon (POJ: chhài-thâu), one of its main ingredients, can also refer to a carrot (POJ: âng-chhài-thâu, literally \"red radish\"). There is no connection between this dish and the sweet Western carrot cake eaten as a dessert. It is called \"carrot cake\" because of a loose English from Hokkien translation of \"radish pastry\" is called \"chai tow (carrot or radish) kway (cake)\", which caught on among the non-native speaking diners, due to its unique misnomer. This misnomer gave the title to a popular guidebook on Singapore's street food, \"There's No Carrot in Carrot Cake\", which was written by Dr. Olivia Law, published by Epigram Books in 2010.\n\nIt is made with radish cake (steamed rice flour, water, and shredded white daikon), which is then stir-fried with eggs, preserved radish, and other seasonings. The radish cake is often served in large rectangular slabs which are steamed and then later fried whole.\n\nAlternatives to \"chai tow kway\" include those made of taro or solely of rice flour.\n\nThe radish cake can also be eaten on its own, either just steamed, or steamed and then pan-fried, as opposed to the steamed then wok-fried with other ingredients in \"chai tow kway\". Both the steamed and pan-fried varieties are commonly served topped with spring onions.\n\nThe versions served by hawkers in Johor and Singapore, where Teochews live, are typically prepared by frying the daikon cake with chopped preserved turnip, diced garlic, eggs, and Chinese fish sauce in place of soya sauce. Chopped spring onion is added just before serving. Northwards (e.g. in Kuala Lumpur), the same dish is darker due to the use of dark soya sauce, and bean sprouts are added. The \"black version\" mentioned below is not \"chai tow kway\", but \"char kway\" and uses rice cake fried with garlic (usually no preserved daikon), bean sprouts, eggs and thick sweet dark sauce.\n\nIn Singapore, however, it is more commonly cut into pieces and stir fried with eggs, garlic, spring onion and occasionally shrimp (both dried and fresh). There are two variants: the \"white\" version does not use sweet soy sauce, and the carrot cake is fried on top of a beaten egg to form a crust; the \"black\" version uses sweet sauce (molasses) and the egg is simply mixed in with the carrot cake.\n\nThe dish has many fans, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, where it is enjoyed by people of different dialect groups and races, and not just the Teochews, and is served in a range of establishments ranging from the simplest hawkers to the most expensive Chinese restaurants. It is a much-loved local comfort food in the region, and can be consumed at various times of the day; it goes from being a breakfast dish, to a side dish, to a late-night supper dish. Many public figures are also known to have a fondness for the dish. Notably, the Singapore politician Chan Chun Sing has indicated his love for the dish in one of his speeches, indicating a preference of a particular variant of the dish (specifically the \"S$10 XO Sauce chye tow kuay\"), as opposed to the one commonly found in hawker centres and coffee shops, thus illustrating the many variations of the dish available in the region.\n\n"}

One evening's radio show is made up of several of these Ultimate Gigs, contributed by different listeners.\n\nAn Ultimate Gig is a listener-selected collection of musical artists (though, in general theory, not necessarily restricted to musical artists), and blended from different performances into one virtual concert performance.\n\nSome archival music chosen also includes unique classic sessions done for BBC's John Peel, a pioneer in getting new and alternative music recorded and aired.\n\nUltimate Gig submitters are usually interviewed on-air, so that they may share their thoughts and reasons for choosing their particular virtual musical admixture.\n\nIn addition, there are other musical themes and sub-themes running in parallel on the show. These intertwined themes may variously include a \"Headline Set\", \"Classic Session\", and a \"Disc From Down Under\". Sundry live reports are filed from journalists and correspondents at the best of the evening's concerts in and about England and elsewhere world-wide. Sometimes, actual radio show listeners report on concerts. New and to-be-released current music of popular and alternative interest is also played and intertwined.\n\nAs is one super-theme of BBC 6 Music generally, there is strong listener (user) interaction with the show, \"in vivo\". Text messages, emails, and telephone calls affect certain non-Ultimate Gig musical themes and musical selections. One way this is done on the show is with listeners emailing in or text messaging in their votes with one word of an appropriately named antonymical word pair, usually with an explanation. One word recommends stopping the currently playing music, another recommends continuing more of it. Examples are \"tragic\" (stop) or \"magic\" (continue), \"sound\" or \"silence\", and \"fan\" or \"can\". The music voted upon, if decided dynamically by the listeners not to be continued, is usually gracefully brought to a reasonable end.\n\nAnother aspect of this show is something called \"webcam words\" which comprise a webcam message. This particular instantiation and expression \"webcam words\" may have been invented by this radio show, although live in-studio webcams are becoming ubiquitous in the radio broadcasting industry.\n\nWebcam words refer to several paper signs in different locations in the live broadcast studio, each appearing on a different webcam, each containing a word, which make up a challenging and subtle related train of thought. It might be topical or musical or both. In some sense, it is semiotically driven in a classical fashion. Listeners are, in an artistic sense, entertained by the possible twists of phrase. Often, listeners compose clever complementary wordings around the webcam words and send them into the show, which are frequently read. Quite regularly, the webcam message is related to a musical theme on that particular evening's show.\n\nInnovations with this show include the interplay of several new technological forces being applied to radio, visual interaction in the otherwise exclusively aural arena of radio, the listener being able to change the direction of the show \"in vivo\", and the simple powerful concept of a virtual performance (Ultimate Gig or Dream Ticket).\n\nAnother challenging thematic innovation of the show is the blending and balancing of current popular music, classic session and performance music from the BBC archives, and new and possibly heretofore unheard alternative music.\n\nIn the 2005 article, \"ANALYSIS: RADIO: Lend them your ears\" by Ian Burrell, The Independent, (London), 23 May 2005, the show is mentioned along with a characterisation of BBC 6 Music:\n\n\"BBC 6 MUSIC Audience: 311,000 Expect: New Order, Blur, British Sea Power A great station for the music cognoscenti, it has the feel of an\nindie record shop where they know every record ever made, who produced it, who played on it, what label it was on and who designed the sleeve. That’s maybe why some women say it’s ‘too blokey’. Star DJs include Steve Lamacq and Bruce Dickinson. Liz Kershaw and Jane Gazzo try to correct any imbalance. The best thing is Dream Ticket, where you imagine you’re at some of the greatest gigs ever …\" \n\n\n"}

It was originally built in 1896 as a restaurant, which closed in 1965. In 1984, the complex reopened as an exhibition and entertainment space, which operated until 2014. , it is under redevelopment to become a hotel. \n\nSince at least 1919, the Trocadero has been abbreviated to the Troc or Chicarito, and under that name it appears in a poem by John Betjeman.\n\nThe complex incorporates a number of separate, but close by historic London buildings, including the old London Pavilion Theatre, that have in the past hosted the Palace of Varieties, the New Private Subscription Theatre, the Royal Albion Theatre, the Argyll Subscription Rooms, the Eden Theatre and the Trocadero Restaurant.\n\nThe name Trocadero indirectly derives from the Battle of Trocadero in 1823, through the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris, named after the French victory.\n\nThe Trocadero Restaurant of J. Lyons and Co. opened in 1896 on a site on Coventry Street, near the theatres of the West End, which had been formerly occupied by the notorious Argyll Rooms, where wealthy men hired prostitutes. A one time maître d'hôtel of the Trocadero was French-born Raymond Monbiot, great-grandfather of the journalist and environmentalist George Monbiot. \n\nThe new settings were done in an Opera Baroque style, and the various Trocaderos of the English-speaking world have derived their names from this original, the epitome of grand Edwardian catering. Murals on Arthurian themes decorated the grand staircase, and the Long Bar catered to gentlemen only. During World War I, the Trocadero initiated the first \"concert tea\": tea was served in the Empire Hall, accompanied by a full concert programme. After the war, cabaret was a feature of the Grill Room. The Trocadero closed on 13 February 1965.\n\nIn 1984, the Trocadero was redeveloped as a tourist-oriented entertainment, cinema and shopping complex. Providing of leisure space, it was the largest leisure scheme in the United Kingdom at the time; only being matched 19 years later by the similar sized Xscape development in Castleford.\nIt retained the external Baroque facade, but gutted the interior and added a \"Guinness Book of World Records Exhibition.\" But tenants were limited, and the half-finished development was eventually sold to Burford Group plc, led by Nick Leslau and Nigel Wray. Nickelodeon UK used to broadcast live from there from 1994 until 1996 when they moved to Rathbone Place, and the place received a boost in the late 1990s with the addition of sponsorship from Pepsi, and Sega as an anchor tenant. The launch of \"SegaWorld\", a large amusement arcade occurred on 7 September 1996, which included a large statue of Sonic the Hedgehog over the front entrance. Pepsi sponsored \"The Pepsi Max Drop\" and from 1997 the \"Pepsi IMAX\" cinema, the first 3D IMAX cinema in the UK. It was also home to the second series of Channel 4's daily reality show \"The Salon.\"\n\nHowever, resultant visitor numbers were poor, and the Guinness Records exhibition closed in the mid-1990s. Following the loss of Sega's sponsorship in 1999, Segaworld became \"Funland\", named after the original arcade that had operated on the basement floor of the building since 1990 , and was subsequently reduced in size. The Pepsi-sponsored IMAX cinema closed in March 2000 shortly after the newer London IMAX opened on the South Bank, and the Drop Ride closed around the same time (The Drop Ride was relocated to Funland in Hayling Island, which has no relation to Funland in the Trocadero outside the name). Remains of old attractions could still be seen around the centre, such as a wall with a gun-barrel motif that used to house the James Bond: License to Thrill ride. The top floors were kept open until autumn 2002, when they were closed and the disused escalator was blocked off with a drinks machine. This was the original entrance to Segaworld when Funland occupied the lower floors. In October 2005, the centre was used as a backdrop for the final scenes of Madonna's \"Hung Up\" video.\n\nCriterion Capital acquired the Trocadero in 2005, and unveiled plans to comprehensively redevelop the site while retaining the listed facade. In 2009, a plan to build a pod hotel with 500 budget rooms inside the building was announced. A new plan for a 583-bedroom hotel including \"pod rooms\", apartments, shops and a rooftop bar was approved by Westminster City Council in August 2012. In March 2014, Criterion Capital announced plans to open a TK Maxx in the centre, 5 years after it was blocked by the Crown Estate.\n\nThe 'rocket' escalator was removed in May 2011, and what remained of Funland closed in July 2011. The locked entrance and a handful of left-over arcade games and attractions remained in a much quieter, emptier Trocadero centre with spaces at basement level for street dancers.\n\nDespite some online articles indicating that the venue would permanently close on 25 February 2014, only a few areas were removed and others remained open while renovation and plans to build the hotel continue. The Cineworld cinema closed on 21 September 2014. This was replaced by a new Picturehouse Cinema called Picturehouse Central, which opened on 19 June 2015.\n\n\n"}

It is usually associated with autoimmune conditions and may be experienced at any age and is not sex specific.\n\nPolyarthritis is most often caused by an auto-immune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, amyloidosis, psoriatic arthritis, and lupus erythematosus but can also be caused by infection with an alphavirus such as chikungunya virus and Ross River virus. This condition is termed alphavirus polyarthritis syndrome. Sindbis virus, which is endemic in Northern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia, is the most widely distributed of the alphaviruses causing polyarthritis, though infection is usually mild or asymptomatic.\n\nIt may be associated with bilateral edema in lower limbs, pain and joint swelling. Sometimes there is previous history of inflammatory joint problems and bilateral edema of lower limbs.\n\nAlphavirus Polyarthritis Syndrome has an incubation period of 3–21 days, depending on the specific virus, with either a gradual or sudden onset of fever, arthralgias, headache, and lymphadenitis and conjunctivitis in some forms. A maculopapular rash may present 4–8 days post symptom onset and may be accompanied by an increase in fever.

L. Weiss describes Crowley's management style as follows:\n\"Based on his own success in Washington, he had concluded that sound administration meant clearly demarcating lines of authority between agencies and, within each, finding the right staff and giving it only the most basic guidance and coordination\".\n\nWeiss' evidence for Crowley's design is a memo Crowley sent to James Byrnes on September 21, 1943, of \"his assessment of the conflict and confusion among the economic agencies operating abroad. His lengthy memorandum argued that the major culprit was the State Department, which interfered with (or micromanaged) the execution of policy when it should only formulate and coordinate it. That led to problems in the field, ranging from wasteful duplication or the more critical problems of needless delays and confusion\".\n\nWeiss details these problems: \"The British … were complaining of difficulty in dealing with 'conflicting jurisdictions' in North Africa; and the New York Times was emphasizing 'uncertainty regarding the representative spheres of OEW(Office of Economic Warfare), Lend-Lease, and OFRRO (Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations) … friction between OEW and the War Food Administration as regards foreign food purchases\".\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", September 26, 1943, Roosevelt said on the occasion of the establishment of the FEA: [Crowley is] \"one of the best administrators in or out of government, [whom] I find great satisfaction in promoting … to a position which will centralize all foreign economic operations in one operating agency\".\n\nWhen the war was over, Harry Truman wound up the FEA. As he reports in his \"Memoirs\", \"When the FEA had been formed in 1943 as a wartime agency, the move involved a merger of all or parts of forty-three different agencies. The functions and services with which it had been charged were such that it could not be stopped suddenly. ... I issued an Executive Order on September 27 terminating the FEA ... not later than December 31, 1945\".\n\nIn 2007 martin Lorenz-Meyer published a book that investigated one of FEA's public programs.

Rovings are produced during the process of making spun yarn from wool fleece, raw cotton, or other fibres. Their main use is as fibre prepared for spinning, but they may also be used for specialised kinds of knitting or other textile arts.\n\nAfter carding, the fibres lie roughly parallel in smooth bundles. These are drawn out, by hand or machine, and slightly twisted to form lengths suitable for spinning. These unspun strands of fibre are the rovings. Roving can also mean a roll of these strands, the strands in general (as a mass noun), or the process of creating them.\n\nBecause it is carded, the fibres are less parallel than top (which is combed) and are not of uniform length. Carded rovings look fluffier than combed top, which looks smooth and has a high lustre. The fibres in combed top tend to be of a fairly uniform length due to the method of preparation. Though drawing it into strips may line the fibres up a bit. Roving is not to be confused with sliver as there is twist in roving.\n\nPencil roving is a type of roving that has been drawn until it is the size of a fat pencil. It can be used by spinners with minimal drafting (withdrawing fibers from a clump). Knitters also use pencil roving, similar to Lopi style yarns, or when making a thrummed item. (Regular roving can also be used in thrummed knitting.)\n"}
{"id": "2054998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054998", "title": "Thomas Gradin", "text": "Thomas Gradin\n\nThomas Kjell Gradin (born February 18, 1956) is a Swedish associate head scout for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and a former professional ice hockey centre who played in the NHL and the Swedish Elite League (SEL) from 1975 to 1990.\n\nFollowing his rookie season in the SEL, Gradin was selected by the Chicago Black Hawks 45th overall in the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. After being traded to the Vancouver Canucks in 1978, he moved to North America to begin his NHL career. Over eight seasons in Vancouver, Gradin established himself as the team's all-time leading scorer and competed in the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals, as well as the 1985 NHL All-Star Game. After a one-year stint with the Boston Bruins, Gradin returned to Sweden, where he finished off his playing career with his former SEL team, AIK.\n\nIn 1994, Gradin returned to the Canucks organization as a scout. His efforts in that capacity has helped the team draft such Swedish players as Daniel Sedin, Henrik Sedin, Mattias Öhlund, and Alexander Edler. Gradin's career with the organization over the years was distinguished by the team with his induction into their Ring of Honour in 2011.\n\nBorn in Sollefteå, Sweden, Gradin played youth hockey for nearby Långsele AIF. At age 14, he began playing men's hockey for Långsele's Division 3 team. In 1972–73, he transferred to Modo. Gradin played in Sweden's Division 1 league with Modo for three seasons before the team moved up to the Swedish Elite League (SEL) in 1975.\n\nAfter scoring 16 goals and 39 points in 35 games in the 1975–76 SEL season, Gradin was selected by the Chicago Black Hawks in the third round, 45th overall, of the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. Unable to come to terms on a contract with Chicago, Gradin remained in Sweden for two more seasons before moving to the NHL. Following his draft, he transferred to AIK in order to accommodate his studies in Stockholm. Playing in his first season with AIK in 1976–77, Gradin scored 16 goals for the second consecutive year. The following campaign, he recorded 37 points, as well as an SEL career-high 22 goals.\n\nIn June 1978, the Black Hawks traded Gradin's NHL rights to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a draft pick. The deal prompted Gradin to move to the NHL three years after his draft. Along with fellow Swedes Lars Zetterström and Lars Lindgren, the trio became the first Europeans to join the Canucks in team history. Playing on a line with fellow rookies Stan Smyl and Curt Fraser, Gradin led the team in assists (31) and finished second in team-scoring (51 points) in 1978–79. His efforts earned him the Cyclone Taylor Award as team MVP, an honour he shared with goaltender Glen Hanlon.\n\nIn ensuing seasons, Gradin established himself as arguably the most skilled player in the franchise's history during his era. He improved to 30 goals and 75 points in 1979–80, ranking second in team-scoring to Smyl's 78 points. With 69 points the following season (21 goals and 48 assists), led the team in scoring for the first time. He repeated the feat in 1981–82 with 86 points, setting a single-season franchise record. The total broke the mark previously set by Smyl two years prior, though Smyl bettered Gradin's mark with an 88-point campaign the following season.\n\nGradin continued to play a starring role for the team in the 1982 playoffs, leading the Canucks in post-season scoring with 19 points in 17 games. Despite entering the playoffs with a losing record (30 wins, 33 losses and 17 ties), the Canucks went on to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in franchise history. Playing the two-time defending champion New York Islanders, the Canucks were swept in four games. Gradin's 19 points ranked fourth in league scoring, behind the Islanders trio of Brian Trottier, Mike Bossy and Denis Potvin. It also stood as a Canucks record for 12 years until Pavel Bure scored 31 in 1994.\n\nContinuing to play in the prime of his career, Gradin recorded 86 points for the second straight year in 1982–83. However, he could not help the Canucks build off of the previous year's playoff success, as the team was eliminated in the first round.\n\nDuring the 1983–84 campaign, Gradin became the Canucks' all-time leading scorer. With his 408th point as a Canuck, he passed former teammate Don Lever, who had left the Canucks in 1980. With 21 goals and a career-high 57 assists, he finished with 78 points on the year. During the 1984–85 season, Gradin earned his first and only appearance in the NHL All-Star Game. He finished the campaign with 64 points, including his seventh consecutive 20-goal season.\n\nIn 1985–86, Gradin was supplanted on the team's top line by countryman Patrik Sundström. Playing on the second line, his single-season points total declined to a career-low 41 points (14 goals and 27 assists). During the off-season, Gradin became a free agent. While the Canucks acquired another centre in Barry Pederson, Gradin opted to sign with the Boston Bruins. He left the team with an all-time leading 550 points (197 goals and 353 assists) over 613 games as a Canuck. His tenure as the franchise's scoring leader was short-lived, as longtime teammate Smyl surpassed his career mark during the ensuing season. Meanwhile, Gradin's mark of 38 points in 38 playoff games as a Canuck stood for seven years until Trevor Linden surpassed it in 1993. His career as a Canuck (including many years as a scout with the organization in subsequent years) was distinguished several decades later when he was inducted into the team's Ring of Honour in 2011. He received the honour during a pre-game ceremony on January 24.\n\nPlaying with the Bruins, Gradin recorded 12 goals and 43 points over 64 games in 1986–87. The season marked his last in the NHL, as Gradin chose to return to his native Sweden for the 1987–88 campaign.\n\nResuming his career with AIK in 1987–88, Gradin recorded 33 points (15 goals and 18 assists) in 38 games, approaching his offensive totals from his early career in Sweden. He went on to record 32- and 29-point campaigns in the following two years before retiring from professional hockey at age 34.\n\nGradin's most notable contribution internationally came at the 1984 Canada Cup, where he captained Sweden's entry and led them to the finals before losing to Canada. He would also represent Sweden at the 1981 Canada Cup, where Sweden finished fifth. He only took part in one World Championships, in 1978.\n\nGradin also starred for Sweden at the 1974, 1975 and 1976 World Junior Championships, helping them to a bronze medal in 1975.\n\nFour years after his retirement as a player, Gradin returned to the Vancouver Canucks organization as an amateur scout prior to the 1994–95 NHL season. After four years in that role, he was promoted to Head of European Scouting in 1998, a position he held until 2007. During that time, he played a key role in the Canucks drafting Daniel and Henrik (1999), Mattias Öhlund and Alexander Edler.\n\nThe latter was a relatively unknown player competing in Sweden's third division (only he and Red Wings scout Håkan Andersson had scouted him). Gradin was instrumental in convincing Vancouver management to trade up in the 2004 draft to select Edler in the third round.\n\nFollowing his tenure as head European scout, he was named associated head scout in 2007.\n\nPeter Gradin, Thomas' younger brother, was also a star hockey player in Sweden throughout the 1980s although he was never drafted by an NHL team.\n\nIn September 2013, Thomas Gradin was appointed Honorary Consul at the Swedish Consulate in Vancouver.\n\n"}

Francisco Alberto Caamaño Deñó (June 11, 1932 – February 16, 1973) was a Dominican soldier and politician who took the constitutional presidency of the Dominican Republic during the Civil War of 1965. He was the son of General Fausto Caamaño Medina; his father was cousin of Juan Pablo Medina de los Santos, the father of both President Danilo Medina Sánchez and House Speaker Lucía Medina Sánchez.\n\nFrancisco Alberto Caamaño Deñó was born on June 11, 1932 in San Juan de la Maguana. He was the son of General Fausto Caamano Medina, who died in 1986. His father was a prominent military man during the dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, and he received the highest decorations of the regime, even holding the position of Secretary of State for the Forces Armadas (Minister of Defense) from 1952 to 1955. \n\nCaamaño's family is originally from San Juan de la Maguana, his military family tree includes other military personalities such as Pedro Plutarco Caamano Medina (1889-1893) his uncle, and others such as Jorge Casimiro Fernández Medina, who was a prominent lieutenant colonel in the Dominican Army. Thanks to the influence of his accentuated military kinship, Francisco Alberto excelled in an efficient and careful vocation of service to the military institutions of his country, entering the Dominican Navy at a young age, where he graduated as Ensign and advanced rapidly in the military ladder. During the last years of the Trujillo Era, Caamano commanded the White Helmeted Corps of the National Police.\n\nDuring the Dominican Republic Civil War that began on April 24, 1965 he was one of the leaders in the movement to restore the democratically elected President Dr. Juan Bosch, who had been overthrown in a military \"coup d'état\" in September, 1963. This faction of loyalists came to be known as the \"Constitucionalistas\", for their desire to return to a rightful and constitutional form of government, as opposed to the military \"junta\" that was in place.\n\nAs the \"Constitucionalistas\" successfully seized and held Santo Domingo over the initial days of the uprising, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson ordered an invasion by the U.S. military, dubbed as Operation Power Pack, with the pretext that the lives of American citizens there needed to be protected. A factor that was arguably more involved in the decision was the fear that the \"Constitucionalistas\" would bring about a communist regime in the country, and this risk of \"another Cuba\" was something that would not be allowed.\n\nDuring this period, Caamaño was de facto and, arguably, de jure, President of the Dominican Republic. After a few months of fighting by the \"Constitucionalistas\", who were outnumbered and outgunned by the foreign forces, Caamaño and his men consented to a reconciliation agreement and thus ended the \"Constitucionalista\" government.\n\nFacing ongoing threats and attacks during the following months, including a particularly violent attack at the Hotel Matum in Santiago de los Caballeros, Camaaño accepted an agreement imposed by the USA government. The Dominican Provisional President, Héctor García-Godoy, sent Colonel Caamaño as the Military Attache to the Dominican Embassy to the UK. While there, he was contacted by Cuban officials and he fled to Cuba to start a guerrilla group. He had a support group led by Amaury German Aristy that was expected to create the conditions for a victorious landing of Caamaño's commands in the Dominican Republic. This group was ambushed by the Dominican Army and killed during a fierce fight that included heavy artillery and even airplanes.\n\nDuring late 1973, after several years staying low-profile, Caamaño led the landing of a small group of rebels at Playa Caracoles, near Azua and then into the mountains of the Cordillera Central, with the purpose of starting a peasant revolution to overthrow Dominican President Joaquín Balaguer. Balaguer's government was repressive and highly centralized during this period, reminding many of the Rafael Trujillo regime in which Balaguer had been one of the dictator's puppet presidents and close advisers. After a few weeks of guerrilla war against Balaguer's regular army and not having received the much hoped-for peasant support, he was wounded and captured by Dominican government forces, and then summarily executed.\n\nSome twenty years passed before Caamaño was officially honored by the Dominican government as a hero for his attempts to restore rightful government to his country. Today, there is an avenue in Santo Domingo that bears the name \"Presidente Caamaño\" (the avenue borders the western bank of the Ozama River harbor, near its outlet to the Caribbean sea). There is also a metro station in Santo Domingo named after him.\n\n\n"}

Photographs of the stars out on the town at the Troc one night might appear in The Hollywood Reporter the next day, as both Cafe Trocadero and THR were owned by William R. Wilkerson.\n\nA black tie French-inspired supper club, at 8610 Sunset Blvd. in the posh Sunset Plaza section of the Strip, it was one of the most famous nightclubs in the world.\n\nIn May 1938, Wilkerson announced that he had sold Cafe Trocadero to Nola Hahn, the owner of Club Continental, formerly the Airport Gardens, an illegal casino on Sonora Avenue in Glendale, California.\n\nWithin a year, however, Cafe Trocadero was under the management of Felix Young, a gambler with ties to producer B.P. Schulberg. Young got into a dispute over the lease with the landlord, Chateau Sunset Corp. and abruptly closed the nightclub in October 1939. Before the month was over, Cafe Trocadero was thrown into involuntary bankruptcy.\n\nThe club briefly reopened later that year as The Trocadero, in time to host the Hollywood premiere party for \"Gone with the Wind\" in December 1939. But by May 1940, the new owners were out of business and the club's furnishings were auctioned off.\n\nWilkerson later launched Ciro's nightclub and LaRue Restaurant, both also on the Strip. He was also the original developer of the Flamingo Las Vegas, but lost control of it to mobster Bugsy Siegel before construction was complete in 1946.\n\nThe cafe operated under a series of managers, including composer and businessman Turk Prujan. Many ads for the Trocadero in the California Eagle contained the headline \"Turk Prujan Presents...\" followed by a musical artist that was to perform at the club.\n\nIn January 1942, just a few weeks after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Felix Young opened a small night club six blocks west of the Cafe Trocadero site, at 9236 Sunset Blvd. on the Strip. His premiere act was an unknown singer, Lena Horne. Her sell-out performances there made her an overnight sensation in Hollywood and led to an engagement at Mocambo, another Strip nightclub, and a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nIn August 1943, bandleader Eddie LeBaron and his brother Albert Gastine opened a new club at 8610 Sunset called Eddie LeBaron's Trocadero. The club would become famous for featuring jitterbugging contests.\n\nAfter World War II, the Trocadero went through a series of owners and managers. It closed for good in 1947.\n\nIn its place stands a Strip Mall today.\n\nAmong the celebrities who frequented the Trocadero were Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, Jackie Gleason, Henry Fonda, Judy Garland, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Jean Harlow, and Norma Shearer.\n\nActress/comedian Thelma Todd, who died mysteriously in December 1935, spent an evening at the Trocadero at a party thrown by Ida Lupino and her father Stanley. Todd had formerly been married to Pat DiCicco, and was angry that he had shown up there with another actress, Margaret Lindsay. The party was one of the last times that she was seen alive.\n\nCafe Trocadero was featured in the 1937 movie \"A Star is Born\" starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March.\n\nIt was also parodied in the 1938 Warner Bros. cartoon, \"Porky at the Crocadero\". The club also received a brief mention, via actual film footage, in 1944's \"What's Cookin' Doc?\".\n\nThere was a mid-1940s low-budget film about the Trocadero and its history starring Ralph Morgan which bore little relation to reality.\n\nThe Trocadero is mentioned in James Ellroy's \"Perfidia\", the night before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe building that housed Cafe Trocadero was demolished long ago and the property stood vacant until 2013 when it was replaced by an upscale storefront building. Today, a nightclub called Sunset Trocadero operates at 8280 Sunset Boulevard, about four blocks east of the former site of Cafe Trocadero.\n\n"}
{"id": "2055021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055021", "title": "Fluoride therapy", "text": "Fluoride therapy\n\nFluoride therapy is the use of fluoride for medical purposes. Fluoride supplements are recommended to prevent tooth decay in children older than six months in areas where the drinking water is low in fluoride. It is typically used as a liquid, pill, or paste by mouth. Where public water supplies are fluoridated further fluoride by mouth is typically not needed. Fluoride has also been used to treat a number of bone diseases.\nNormal doses may occasionally result in white marks on the teeth. Excessive doses can result in brown or yellow coloring of the teeth. Fluoride therapy typically uses the sodium fluoride form, though stannous fluoride may also be used. Fluoride appears to decrease breakdown by acids, increase remineralisation, and decrease the activity of bacteria. It is believed to work mostly through direct contact with the teeth after they have emerged.\nFluoride came into use to prevent tooth decay in the 1940s. Fluoride, as sodium fluoride, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom a typical month supply costs the NHS about . It is also not very expensive in the United States. In 2016, sodium fluoride was the 215th most prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions.\n\nFluoride therapy has been proven to have a beneficial effect on the prevention of dental caries. Robust evidence supports the use of fluoride toothpaste (with concentrations of 1000 ppm and above) and fluoride supplements, in the form of drops and tablets, to reduce the risk of dental caries in school-aged children and adolescents. The ingestion of fluoride as primary teeth are being developed has shown that the teeth have formed stronger and more resistant for caries. Water and milk fluoridation are two forms of systemic fluoride therapy that have been demonstrated to be effective at preventing dental caries.\n\nFluoride supplementation has been extensively studied for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This supplementation does not appear to be effective; even though sodium fluoride increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures.\n\nThe use of fluoride toothpaste (with concentrations of 1000 ppm and above) and fluoride supplements in children below the age of six years, and especially within the first three years of life, is associated with a greater risk of dental fluorosis. However, the use of fluoride supplements during the last six months of pregnancy has no significant impact on the incidence of fluorosis in children. It has also been estimated that optimal water fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries increases the prevalence of dental fluorosis by 4 to 5%. The observed effects are mild to moderate, usually of minimal aesthetic concern.\n\nReports have claimed that water fluoridation can be linked to the development of osteoporosis and various cancers; however, a recent systematic review has found no evidence to support these claims.\n\nConsumption of large amounts of fluoride can lead to fluoride poisoning and death; the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg elemental fluoride/kg body weight). Ingestion of fluoride can produce gastrointestinal discomfort at doses at least 15 to 20 times lower (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) than lethal doses. Chronic intake and topical exposure may cause dental fluorosis, and excess systematic exposure can lead to systemic effects such as skeletal fluorosis. Young children are at risk for receiving excess fluoride, and the American Dental Association (ADA) has recently issued an interim guidance on their fluoride consumption.\n\nIn 1974 a three-year-old child swallowed 45 milliliters of 2% fluoride solution, estimated to be triple the fatal amount, and then died. The fluoride was administered during his first visit to the dentist, and the dental office was later found liable for the death.\n\nStrictly speaking, fluoride therapy repairs rather than prevents damage to the teeth, causing the mineral fluorapatite to be incorporated into damaged tooth enamel. Fluorapatite is not a natural component of human teeth, although it is found in the teeth of sharks. The main mineral found in natural tooth enamel is hydroxyapatite rather than the fluorapatite created in the presence of fluoride. Even without fluoride, teeth experience alternating increases and decreases in mineral content, depending upon how acidic or alkaline the mouth is, and depending upon the concentration of other substances in the mouth, such as phosphate and calcium.\n\nFluoride reduces the decay of tooth enamel by the formation of fluorapatite and its incorporation into the dental enamel. The fluoride ions reduce the rate of tooth enamel demineralization and increase the rate of remineralization of teeth at the early stages of cavities. Fluoride exerts these effects by the demineralization and remineralization cycle. The remineralization cycle, critical to decay prevention, occurs when fluoride is present in the oral cavity. After fluoride is swallowed it has a minimal effect.\n\nFluoride ions are involved in three principal reactions of remineralization:\nIso-ionic exchange by the replacement of F for OH¯ in apatite and crystal growth of fluorapatite from supersaturated solutions are able to occur during exposure to low levels of fluoride (0.01-10 ppm F) over long periods of time. Reaction of apatite dissolution with CaF formation occurs in higher levels of fluoride (100-10,000 ppm F) and the addition of CaF or a CaF containing compound.\n\nFluoride's effect on oral microflora and the significance of this effect on fluoride's overall effectiveness against cavities does not currently have a consensus. Many studies on bacterial cells in laboratories have shown the fluoride has many effects on them as an antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial effects require concentrations of fluoride at least 10 ppm F, which only occurs briefly in the mouth with oral fluoride-containing products. A study looked at fluoride's effects on oral microflora and concluded that fluoride may not solely interact as an antimicrobial agent, acting additionally to reduce bacterial adhesion to teeth, along with the primary action of decreasing demineralization. Further investigation will need to be done to verify these claims.\n\nFluoride can be delivered by many chemical methods (sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, amine fluoride, monofluorophosphate, and more). The anti-caries performance differences between them have been shown to have less effect than variations in behavior shown by individuals in brushing, using fluoride products and post use behavior. Often the chemical form of fluoride is driven by compatibility with the other elements mixed with, price, and such.\n\nAll fluoridation methods provide low concentrations of fluoride ions in saliva, thus exerting a topical effect on the plaque fluid. Fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop, and so repeated exposure throughout the day is essential for its effective function. The more constant the supply the more beneficial fluoride will be in cavity prevention.\n\nWater fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply in order to reduce tooth decay. Its use in the U.S. began in the 1940s, following studies of children in a region where water is naturally fluoridated. In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan became the first city in the world to fluoridate its drinking water. The Grand Rapids water fluoridation study was originally sponsored by the U.S. Surgeon General, but was taken over by the NIDR shortly after the Institute's inception in 1948. It is now used for about two-thirds of the U.S. population on public water systems and for about 5.7% of people worldwide. Although the best available evidence shows no association with adverse effects other than fluorosis, most of which is mild, water fluoridation has been contentious and opposition to water fluoridation exists despite its support by public health organizations. Water fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to induce fluoride, with an estimated cost between US$0.50 and $3.00 per person per year, depending on the size of the community involved. A dollar spent on fluoridating water is estimated to save $7–$42 on dental treatment.\n\nMost toothpastes contains between 0.22% (1,000 ppm) and 0.312% (1,450 ppm) fluoride, usually in the form of sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP). Frequent use of toothpaste with 1,100 ppm fluoride content enhances the remineralization of enamel and inhibits the demineralization of enamel and root surfaces. Most toothpastes with fluoride contain mild abrasives in order to remove heavier debris and light surface staining. These abrasives include calcium carbonate, silica gels, magnesium carbonates and phosphate salts.\n\nFluoride is available in three forms during toothbrushing. First, it is available as a free ionic fluoride which can react with the tooth structure, interfere with the metabolism of bacteria in plaque, or absorb to the oral mucosa. Second, it is available as profluoride compounds which can precipitate in the mouth during toothbrushing and release ionic fluoride. Lastly, fluoride in toothpaste can exist as unavailable fluoride compounds which do not release fluoride ions. This is due to the fluoride ions being swallowed or expelled when spitting.\n\nHigh-fluoride content toothpaste generally contains 1.1% (5,000 ppm) sodium fluoride toothpaste. This type of toothpaste is used in the same manner as regular toothpaste. The application of high-fluoride content toothpaste in adults twice daily improves the surface hardness of untreated root decay when compared to toothpaste with regular fluoride content.\n\nFluoridated toothpaste is also available in the form of 0.454% stannous fluoride. It appears to be effective in reducing tooth hypersensitivity. Additionally, brushing twice daily with a toothpaste containing stannous fluoride may reduce gingivitis, gingival bleeding and dental plaque.\n\nAnti-sensitivity toothpastes with fluoride are also available for those who have sensitive teeth. Some anti-sensitivity toothpastes with fluoride on the market contain the ingredients called strontium chloride or potassium nitrate which help to alleviate tooth sensitivity.\n\nFluoride mouth rinses can be professionally applied by a dental professional or used at home. The most common fluoride compound used in mouth rinse is neutral sodium fluoride. Fluoride mouth rinses range from 0.05% to 0.2% (225-1,000 ppm) in concentration. The fluoride rinse with a 0.05% fluoride content is used for daily rinsing, while the rinse with 0.2% fluoride content is used for weekly rinsing and in school-based weekly rinsing programs. Fluoride at these concentrations is not strong enough for people at high risk for tooth decay. Regular use of a daily (230 ppm) or weekly (900 ppm) fluoride mouth rinse under supervision results into a reduction of tooth decay in children's permanent teeth. After a fluoride mouthrinse treatment, the fluoride in the mouthrinse is retained in the saliva which helps prevent tooth decay.\n\nFluoride mouth rinses are recommended for use in conjunction with other fluoride therapies, but is usually contraindicated for children under six years old as they may swallow the rinse and increase their risk of dental fluorosis. In areas without fluoridated drinking water, these rinses are recommended for children.\n\nMany brands of topical fluoride exist. They are not recommended if a person is drinking water that already contains sufficient fluoride.\n\nThere are several types of professionally applied fluoride gels and foams on the market. The types of professionally applied fluoride gels include 2.0% neutral sodium fluoride and 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride. 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride gel or foam is used for patients without tooth-colored restorations, while 2.0% neutral sodium fluoride is used for patients with composites, porcelain, titanium, sealants or sensitivity.\n\nProfessionally applied fluoride gel or foam is applied through the use of a foam mouth tray which is held in the mouth by gently biting down. The application usually lasts for approximately four minutes, and patients should not rinse, eat, smoke, or drink for 30 minutes after application. The reason for this is to allow the teeth to absorb the fluoride into the tooth structure when it is at its highest concentration, without being interrupted. This aids in the repair of microscopic dental decay. There is no clinical evidence on the effectiveness of one-minute fluoride gel/foam applications. A specific benefit when using foam is that less product is required during application, which results in a lower fluoride dose and lessens the risk of accidental ingestion. Additionally, more research regarding the efficacy of fluoride foam is needed as the evidence for its effectiveness is not as strong compared to those of fluoride gels and varnish.\n\nSome gels are made for home application with the use of a custom tray. A model of a person's teeth can be made by a dental professional, who then uses that to make trays, similar to a sport guard tray, which is put over their teeth. The patient can then use this to hold a fluoride treatment against their teeth overnight or several minutes during the day. The concentration of fluoride in these gels is much lower than in professional products. The self-applied sodium fluoride gel/foam typically contains 0.5% fluoride and stannous fluoride gel/foam contains 0.15%.\n\nHead and neck radiation treatment may destroy the cells of the salivary gland which can result in dry mouth. Patients with reduced salivary flow are at an increased risk of tooth decay. The home application of 1.1% fluoride gel with a custom tray is recommended for patients undergoing or are finished with head and neck radiation treatment and patients with decreased salivary flow.\n\nMore research is required regarding the efficacy of fluoride gels in treating initial dental decay lesions.\n\nFluoride varnish has practical advantages over gels in ease of application and use of smaller volume of fluoride than required for gel applications. The principle of fluoride varnish is to apply fluoride salt in a very high concentration (approximately 50,000 ppm) onto the surface of the teeth. Fluoride varnish is a resin-based application that is designed to stay on the surface of the teeth for several hours. As this varnish rests on the tooth's surface, saliva dissolves the fluoride salt, which in turn allows fluoride ions to be released and absorbed by the teeth and soft tissues. Later, the fluoride is re-released into the oral cavity from these reservoirs which acts as protection for the teeth against cavities. Currently, there is also no published evidence that indicates that professionally applied fluoride varnish is a risk factor for enamel fluorosis. The varnish is applied with a brush and sets within seconds.\n\nFluoride varnish has shown to be effective in reducing initial dental decay lesions in both primary and permanent dentition. Application of fluoride varnish every six months is effective in preventing dental decay in primary and permanent teeth of children and adolescents.\n\nDevices that slowly release fluoride can be implanted on the surface of a tooth, typically on the side of a molar where it is not visible and does not interfere with eating. The two main types are copolymer membrane and glass bead. These devices are effective in raising fluoride concentrations and in preventing cavities, but they have problems with retention rates, that is, the devices fall off too often. A 2018 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effect of slow-release fluoride glass beads in caries-inhibiting when compared to other types of fluoride therapy.\n\nFluoridated lozenges may contain about 1 mg fluoride each, and are meant to be held in the mouth and sucked. The dissolved lozenge is swallowed slowly, so the use of lozenges is both a topical and a systemic therapy. A 1955 study comparing the effects of fluoride lozenges and fluoride pills provided clear evidence early that fluoride acts topically.\n\nMedical fluoride supplements in the form of tablets, lozenges, or liquids (including fluoride-vitamin preparations) are used primarily for children in areas without fluoridated drinking water. The evidence supporting the effectiveness of this treatment for primary teeth is weak. The supplements prevent cavities in permanent teeth. A significant side effect is mild to moderate dental fluorosis. A Cochrane review also found no evidence that daily fluoride supplementation in pregnant women was effective in preventing tooth decay or causing fluorosis in their children.\n\n"}

{"id": "2055056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055056", "title": "Free Tibet", "text": "Free Tibet\n\nFree Tibet (FT) is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation, founded in 1987 and based in London, England. FT, according to their mission statement, advocates for “a free Tibet in which Tibetans are able to determine their own future and the human rights of all are respected.”\n\nThe organisation is a member of the International Tibet Network (ITN), a worldwide group of affiliated organisations campaigning for human rights and self-determination in Tibet.\n\nAccording to their website FT campaigns for an end to China's occupation of Tibet and for international recognition of Tibetans' right to freedom. They mobilize active support for the Tibetan cause, champion human rights, and challenge those whose actions sustain what they see as occupation.\n\nAs a result of China's censorship, many political dissenters are arrested and imprisoned for promoting or expressing religious, social, economic, and political principles the Communist Party of China (CPC) disapproves of. FT seeks the release of political prisoners through lobbying political leaders, circulating petitions, and organising Urgent Action Campaigns. This approach has been successful in securing the early release of prominent political prisoners such as Phuntso Nyidon, reducing Tenzin Delek Rinpoche's sentence from a death sentence to life in prison and was possibly influential in ensuring Runggye Adak's relatively low-length sentence in 2007. FT maintains a list of current prisoners, released prisoners, and those that have received death sentences.\n\nIn June 2016, FT received reports that Larung Gar Buddhist Academy in eastern Tibet was soon to undergo a series of evictions and demolitions. An order issued by the government of Serta County stated that the population was to be reduced to a maximum of 5,000 residents over the next 15 months, down from the well over 10,000 living there at the time. The order also imposed a system of joint management on the monastery, with Chinese Communist Party officials outnumbering monastic officials three to two under the new regime. The monastery was also required to hand over financial management to Chinese authorities. The work at Larung Gar began on 20 July 2016, as residents were moved out and their residences demolished. Free Tibet was able to garner media attention for the situation at Larung Gar with stories in the BBC, \"The Times\" and \"The New York Times\" among others. Free Tibet helped to organise a series of world-wide protests at Chinese embassies and also initiated an online petition and various emailing campaigns directed at the United Front Work Department, Chinese Embassies and Foreign Ministers. Following on from these, the situation at Larung Gar was brought up by the US State Department, the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission as well as various Canadian and British MPs.\n\nIn 2013 FT launched the \"Parasites in Paradise\" campaign to protest Intercontinental Hotels' opening of the Lhasa Paradise Hotel in Tibet.\n\nTogether with Students for a Free Tibet, FT called for a boycott of InterContinental Hotels, asserting that the Lhasa Paradise Hotel was little more than a \"PR coup for the Chinese government\" and that the marginalisation of the Tibetan people will only increase with the building of the hotel. On their website Free Tibet writes that, \"Intercontinental will sell the image of a peaceful, spiritual and unspoiled land, but after more than 60 years of military occupation by the world’s largest dictatorship, Tibet is no paradise.\" Additionally, it has been argued that the Tibetan people themselves would not benefit from any jobs or opportunities which would be created by the hotel's opening as the hotel's staff will speak Chinese, a language most Tibetans cannot speak. Tibetan illiteracy is a major concern of many activists and scholars as Chinese is the language of economic, social, and political life in Tibet.\n\nIn addition to the boycott, Free Tibet sent a petition of over 10,500 signatures to InterContinental's chief executive Richard Solomons. The petition called for Solomons to pull InterContinental out of Lhasa because IHG's operation of a hotel in Tibet, where China's human rights violations have been especially prominent, \"is in direct contradiction to Intercontinental's Corporate Social Responsibility policies.\" Free Tibet also organised protests in London in an effort to sway InterContinental.\n\nInvestigations into China's human rights situation have shown that torture is used routinely in many prisons and interrogations. In 2008 Free Tibet submitted evidence to the UN Committee Against Torture in Geneva detailing the record of abuse inside Tibet. Subsequently, the UN Committee concluded that torture in Tibet is \"widespread and routine\".\n\nFT has also worked alongside celebrities such as Alan Rickman, David Threlfall, Juliet Stevenson, and Dominic West to record testimonies of tortured Tibetans. The organisation used the video testimonies to create more awareness and urge people to take action by writing to William Hague and Chinese political representatives to put a stop to torture in Tibet.\n\nIn 2004 Free Tibet organised a UK tour for Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who was arrested during the Chinese invasion of Tibet. Gyatso spent 33 years in Chinese prisons and labor camps enduring systematic torture after being arrested for calling for Tibet's freedom. Gyatso was released in 1992 and escaped to India, he has since toured the world spreading awareness about human rights violations in Tibet. During the 2004 tour he spoke at numerous conventions, and events.\n\nIn February 2015 Free Tibet joined with their research partner, Tibet Watch, to write a report on Chinese torture in Tibet. The report, \"Torture in Tibet,\" it was submitted to the United Nations Committee Against Torture. \"Torture in Tibet\" documents torture survivor testimonies from Golog Jigme, Tenzin Namgyal, and Kelsang Tsundue, Tibetan deaths in custody, deaths resulting from torture, and a number of prisoners who they believe to be at particular risk of torture.\n\nFree Tibet launched their Confucius Classroom campaign in order to spread awareness about the negative aspects of Hanban's Confucius Institute. The Confucius Institute is a program run through the organisation Hanban which is directed by the People's Republic of China Ministry of Education. Confucius Institutes are established over 500 Confucius Institutes in Universities and well over 600 Confucius Classrooms in schools overseas. Although Confucius Classrooms focus on language and culture, the Hanban employed tutors must also promote an “understanding of China\" and the tutors are banned from teaching about certain aspects of Chinese history, culture, and society. The program has been labeled by some as propagandistic and has been criticised for limiting academic freedom and thought through self-censorship. This controversy was enhanced when a senior Chinese politician described the programme as “an important part of China’s \"overseas propaganda set-up.\"\n\nFT has been providing media updates, press releases, and news stories regarding Confucius Classrooms in the UK. The organisation has also reached out to schools operating Confucius Classrooms and provided them with teaching materials to ensure that students also learn about the humanitarian and environmental issues surrounding Tibet. Additionally, Free Tibet calls for public action through contacting local Ministry of Education officials.\n\nThrough their Jailed Musicians campaign Free Tibet works to bring awareness to the global community of China's censorship laws. The organisation lists ten different musicians who have been arrested and imprisoned because of their artistic works, however many other unlisted Tibetan musicians have been detained. Free Tibet approached the UN and in a joint urgent appeal asked for an official inquiry into the whereabouts of each musician as many of the artists’ whereabouts are unknown. The UN responded and China was forced to provide information concerning the trials, whereabouts, and sentences of most of the jailed singers. However Chinese officials could not account for the whereabouts or conditions of two different men who had also been arrested. The charge laid against the musicians was for, \"seditiously splitting the state,\" and the men received sentences ranging two to six years; however many of the imprisoned singers were held without a trial or legal representation for extended periods of time. Free Tibet calls for the release of the jailed singers, stating, “Music is a vital part of Tibetans' resistance to Chinese rule. Singers like these not only keep alive a culture that China is trying to erase from the world, but their songs embody the aspirations, fears and courage of a people who remain proud and defiant after 60 years of occupation.” The campaign focuses on educating the public about the censorship and oppression of art and expression in China while also advocating for the imprisoned men through a petition and through lobbying domestic and foreign politicians. But Tibetan musicians still perform which can be seen on websites such as YouTube.\n\nFree Tibet launched their Break the Silence campaign to highlight the reluctance of world leaders to publicly speak out in support of Tibet. China's foreign policy surrounding the Dalai Lama is strict and world leaders' meetings with the Dalai Lama oftentimes causes major friction with China. China is able to easily intimidate many world leaders from meeting with the Dalai Lama and from speaking out in support of Tibet.\n\nThe campaign encourages supporters to write to world leaders and ask them to speak out for Tibet. Two videos were developed by Free Tibet, one featuring David Cameron and one featuring Barack Obama.\n\nIn March 2008 Free Tibet reported extensively on the unrest in Tibet which precipitated a series of large scale protests. Tibet Support Groups (TSGs) continue to gather evidence about the protests, their suppression and repercussions.\n\nDuring the process of securing an Olympics bid from the International Olympics Committee (IOC), China promised to improve its human rights record. Wang Wei, head of the bid committee was quoted saying, \"We are confident that the Games coming to China not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions, including education, health and human rights.\" However, China largely failed to improve its human rights abuses and major news sources around the world criticised both the Chinese government for failing to fulfil its promise and the IOC for not being more discerning in its choice for the 2008 Olympics. Activists argued that China's human rights violations were incompatible with the spirit of the Olympic Games.\n\nFree Tibet worked to expose Chinese human rights violations through helping to organise and participating in large scale rallies in central London during the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay in which thousands of Tibet supporters filled the streets. The magnitude of the protests was such that China and the IOC were forced, in a move that was highly publicised, to reduce and re-route relays in other cities.\n\nFollowing the Olympics, China analysts speculated on the possibility that the authorities would begin dealing harshly with Tibetan dissenters after world attention moved off Beijing. After the Olympics ended, Chinese authorities did initiate a state of \"de facto\" martial law in Tibet by moving troops into Tibetan areas and handing down harsh sentences for Tibetans who protested against Chinese rule or who reported on the human rights conditions in Tibet.\n\nAgain in 2012, Free Tibet started a campaign with a focus on the Olympics, the new campaign was titled Fly the Flag. In order to highlight China's illegal occupation of Tibet, Free Tibet encouraged supporters to send in pictures of themselves with the flag of Tibet at Olympic locations around London and Great Britain. Through this campaign Free Tibet also exposed the IOC's ban on the Tibetan flag at the Olympics. Fly the Flag especially highlights Chinese suppression of Tibetan freedom of expression as the Tibetan flag itself is banned in China and anyone in possession of the flag or its image is subject to official questioning and arrest.\n\nFree Tibet unsuccessfully created a petition calling for the International Olympics Committee (IOC) to refrain from giving the bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics to Beijing. In 2008 when Beijing hosted the summer Olympics, China promised to improve its human rights record before the Olympic Games. However China failed to ameliorate their human rights abuses and instead continued to oppress citizens and media outlets. On the basis of continued human rights violations, Free Tibet argued that China should not be considered a suitable place for the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nOn 10 June 2015 Free Tibet worked with the International Tibet Network to stage a protest outside of the Lausanne Palace Hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland. The protest was successful in disrupting the bid process and in catching the attention of international media.\n\nIn 2014, a Free Tibet investigation uncovered around 100 fake online accounts Chinese authorities were using propagandistically. The accounts had fake western names and photographs taken from randomly chosen websites and personal accounts. Each fake profile circulated pro-Chinese, anti-Dalai Lama propaganda in an attempt to convince followers that Tibet was free from humanitarian and environmental strife and was in actuality an idyllic and peaceful province in China. Free Tibet wrote that, \"China is highly sensitive to any signs of international support for Tibetan freedom and has declared its intention to 'win over' Western public opinion on the issue. Its message is that Tibetans have benefited hugely from Chinese investment and that the environment and culture of Tibet is protected and safe in China's hands,\" in its exposition of the propaganda campaign. Twitter removed the fake accounts after Free Tibet submitted an official complaint to the social media executives.\n\n"}

Its objective is to encourage the spirit of aviation and air-mindedness in the youth of Australia. The Australian Air League receives no money or assistance of any government department and is entirely self-funded. Its Latin motto is \"A Vinculo Terrae\" (\"Free From the Bonds of The Earth\"). The official patron of the Australian Air League is aviation journalist Jeff Watson.\n\nMr. George Robey was an Australian soldier who distinguished himself as an original ANZAC. He won a Distinguished Conduct Medal on 25 April 1915 at the Gallipoli landing. Mr. Robey was still a soldier, in the Citizen Military Forces when in 1927 he went to Canberra to assist in the Ceremonial Opening of Parliament House.\n\nHe brought back a toy wooden aeroplane for his son Keith that sparked an interest in aviation that inspired his son and that inspiration has lasted until the present day.\n\nKeith Robey through his career has been a senior executive of one of Australia's largest general aviation companies. Keith has also been known as a well-respected aviation feature writer for \"Aircraft\" magazine, specialising in flight testing of aircraft.\n\nThe gift of the toy wooden aeroplane also sparked off the \"Australian Air League\" when five years later Keith complained of the lack of a youth organisation specialising in aviation.\n\nHis father George Robey and other concerned adults formed the \"Air Mindedness Development League\" and on 18 July 1934 Keith became enrolled as the first Cadet member. Not long after that the name was changed to the \"Australian Air League\".\n\nThe first training Squadron opened at Manly, New South Wales on 17 January 1935 with 30 Cadets aged between 14 and 23 years. The first girls Squadron opened in 1944. The Correspondence Wing commenced in 1941. By 1942, 26,000 boys had been trained in aviation and 125 Squadrons operated in three states.\n\nWorld War II took its toll as many of the Officers went into the services and at the end of hostilities, felt that they had experienced more than enough of wearing uniforms and discipline and hence many Squadrons closed.\n\nHowever, the \"Australian Air League\" has continued. There are around 76 active Squadrons and more squadrons continue to open. The founders of the \"Australian Air League\" saw the prosperous future for aviation and the \"Australian Air League\" has become part of that future being recognised in the aviation industry and Armed Services as the primary school of aviation. Over the years it has been held in high respect by the leaders of the Nation and from early stages of our history, Governors General of Australia have been Patron-In-Chief of the Australian Air League.\n\nOn 21 April 2009, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority granted the Australian Air League official use of the Australian Civil Aviation Ensign to recognise the organisation's significant contribution to aviation in Australia. The Australian Air League paraded and flew the flag at the organisation's 75th Anniversary Review in Sydney on 26 September 2009. It is the first time the honour of flying the flag has ever been granted to any other organisation outside of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's jurisdiction.\n\nToday the Australian Air League Inc. is an independent organisation and is not associated with, or sponsored by, any religious, military or other organisation. It is completely self-governing and self-supporting.\n\nAs a not for profit organisation, the Australian Air League relies on the help of a network of volunteers to carry out the various tasks which need to be fulfilled in order for the organisation to exist.\n\nComing from a wide range of backgrounds, these volunteers bring a variety of different skills to the League and contribute by joining the League as either an associate or League member, from where then can play a vital role in the operation of various levels of the league.\n\nAssociate membership provides a way for adults to join as non-uniformed, but financial, members of the League. Associate members are eligible to serve on the Squadron 'Branch Committee' from where they can directly assist the squadron by helping to keep track of the Squadrons finances and co-ordinating fund-raising activities.\n\nAssociate members are also eligible to participate in most functions and activities that are open to uniformed members.\n\nAlternatively an adult may wish to join the League as an Officer. Such people are inducted into the League's Trainee Officer Programme, where they are given the rank of Trainee Officer and taken through a series of courses covering the day-to-day operations of a squadron, the expectations they will face, and correct procedure for handling different situations.\n\nUpon completing the course the new member is awarded the rank of Second Officer and is attached to a unit, usually the squadron in their local area.\n\nThe Australian Air League has an internal rank structure for all uniformed members which is replicated from various organisations including military forces, police forces and Commercial aviation organisations.\n\nThe ranks are divided into three categories. The first are the Cadet ranks (referred to as N.C.O. ranks). These ranks are awarded to members of a Squadron, aged under 18 years, who have displayed, amongst other things, excellent leadership abilities, discipline and determination. These promotions are recommended by the Officer Commanding Squadron. The candidate for promotion must complete a variety of tasks in order to prove their suitability for the position, such as passing oral and written examinations.\n\nIn the second category there are supernumery ranks. These are ranks held by members who do not fit into the Officer or Cadet ranking system. Ranks in this category are held by uniformed adult members.\n\nIn the third category are the Officer ranks. These are ranks are awarded to uniformed adult members of the League based upon their performance and appointment within their respective unit. These promotions are recommended by the officer's immediate superior.\n\nThe ranks an individual member holds is signified by either a series chevrons worn on both sleeves for N.C.O. ranks, or by a series of blue, silver or gold stripes worn on the epaulettes for supernumerary and officer ranks. An absence of any rank insignia indicates a rank of \"Cadet\".\n\nThe ranks in this chart are listed with each successive rank down the page being superior to the one preceding it.\n\nThe ranks in this chart are listed with each successive rank down the page being superior to the one preceding it.\nThe ranks in this chart are listed with each successive rank down the page being superior to the one preceding it.\n\nThe term \"Cadet\" refers to a member who is under the age of 18 and/or holds one of the NCO ranks.\nUpon turning the age of 16 a Cadet becomes a Senior Cadet and wears dark blue epaulettes.\n\nA Section is defined as a group of five Cadets, three of whom may be Leading Cadets, with a Corporal in charge of the Section for a total of six members. If the Section contains all three Leading Cadets, they comprise the first three members on the Corporal's left when forming up.\n\nA Flight consists of 3 Sections in formation under the command of a Sergeant, making a total of 19 members.\n\nWhen assembled as a Flight, each horizontal line of 6 cadets is known as a \"rank\". The 3 \"ranks\" are referred to as 'A', 'B' and 'C' sections, with 'A' section forming the front rank, 'B' section in the middle rank, and 'C' section at the rear. Each vertical line of cadets is known as a file. Each file is associated a number. (1 through 6 numbered from Sergeant's left)\n\nA Flag Party is ceremonial unit paraded by Squadrons, Wings, Groups and Federal. Within a Squadron it can take 2 forms:\n1 - 1 NCO in Charge, 3 bearers and 3 escorts;\n2 - 1 NCO in Charge, 1 bearer and 2 escorts.\n\nThe first version consists of three flags, the State, National and Squadron flag. The second version may only consist of the Squadron or unit flag.\n\nWing, Group and Federal Flag Parties may only take the second form.\n\nThe ranks of the members in a Squadron Flag party must satisfy the following criteria:\n\n\nSeveral Squadrons, Wings and Groups throughout the Australian Air League also have marching bands, made up of Cadets and Officers with an NCO in charge who is the Drum Major. The Drum Major is equivalent in rank to a Sergeant, although whilst in the band they are in charge of all personnel, including Officers.\n\nAir League bands are typically composed of either a Drum Corps, or a Drum & Bugle Corps and can vary in size from 9 personnel up to a full band of 24 personnel. Air League bands compete in competitions as well as provide music during parades, both for the Air League as well as outside events such as ANZAC Day, Reserve Forces Day, Community Festivals and other promotional work for the Air League.\n\nA full Squadron consists of any number of Flights and a Flag Party with a Squadron Sergeant being in charge of the all units. Rather than directly ordering each unit, the Squadron Sergeant conveys orders to the N.C.O.s in charge of each sub-unit, who then relay the orders to their subordinates.\n\nThe Squadron also has a number of non-command Officers who are referred to as the Squadron Staff. The command level officer of the squadron is the \"Officer Commanding Squadron\", usually abbreviated to \"S.O.C.\", or just \"O.C.\" when used in a Squadron environment.\n\nA list of operating Squadrons can be viewed at the Air League National Website\n\nA Wing consists of at least 2 Squadrons, who usually share a common geographical location.\n\nA region consists of at least 2 wings which usually share a larger geographical area. For example, \"Eastern Region\".\n\nA Group coordinates the League's activities at a State level and consists of all league units, other than federal units, in their particular state. Group Status is defined by the League's Chief Commissioner, according to set criteria. Units in states that do not conform to these criteria are designated Wings of the Federal Department.\n\nAt present, the following groups currently exist within the League:\n\nThe Australian Air League holds Reviews on several layers of administration, ranging from Wing Reviews, Group Reviews and Australian Air League Reviews. Group Reviews are usually held annually and Australian Air League Reviews are usually held every 2–3 years. Reviews are held in order to maintain a sense of healthy competition between Groups, Wings and Squadrons. The basic function of a Review is to investigate the standard of ceremonial drill in the Air League. The latest Australian Air League Review was held in 2018 at Sydney, New South Wales.\n\nAustralian Air League members participate and compete in several activities including Camping, Ceremonial Drill, Model Aircraft Building and Flying, Sports and the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Several members have achieved and have been awarded with their Gold Duke of Edinburgh. Community Service is a major part of an Australian Air League members life. They volunteer for events like the NSW Premier's Senior Citizens Concert, the Red Shield Appeal for the Salvation Army and Clean Up Australia Day. They also participate in local festivals and ANZAC Day Parades.\n\nEducation classes have been provided for the benefit of members. They include:\n\nMembers also have the opportunity to gain the AAL General Diploma, the AAL Aviation Diploma, and the AAL Gold Diploma by obtaining the selected amount of education badges the courses prescribes within a particular time period.\n\nMembers can also undergo flight training at the age of 16. The league operates a training school from Camden Airport which is staff by members and volunteers\n\n"}

Over the years, it has offered musical comedies, vaudeville, opera, and burlesque. The Trocadero Theatre was refurbished for use as an art house cinema and fine arts theatre in 1970s, and by the 1990s had become an iconic venue for rock and punk concerts.\n\nThe theater, designed by architect Edwin Forrest Durang, then modified several times, was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 1973, and to the National Register of Historic Places five years later.\n\nThe building was known at various time as the Arch Street Opera House (1870–1879); Park Theatre (1879); New Arch Street Opera House (1884); Continental Theatre (1889); Gaiety Theatre (1890); Casino/Palace Theatre (1892), Troc Theatre (1940); Slocum's and Sweatman's Theatre; Sweatman's Arch Street Opera House; Simmon's & Slocum's Theatre; and Simmon's Theatre.

It is the uppermost town situated on the Volga River. Population: \n\nRzhev was founded in the Middle Ages and rivals Toropets as the oldest town in the region. Rzhevians usually point out that their town is mentioned in the Novgorod laws as early as 1019. Their neighbors from Toropets, on the other hand, give more credence to Rzhev's first mention in a major chronicle under 1216, when it was in possession of Mstislav the Bold, Prince of Toropets. Whatever the truth may be, it is clear that medieval Rzhev was bitterly contested by three regional powers—the Novgorod Republic, the Principality of Smolensk, and the Grand Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal. Following the Mongol invasion, Rzhev passed to a lateral branch of the Smolensk dynasty, which made the town its capital. Later the princes divided the town in two parts, which are still called the Prince-Dmitry's Side and Prince-Theodor's Side. In the mid-14th century, they had a hard time repelling attacks from Algirdas of Lithuania and Grand Princes of Tver, who bought all the villages around the town. Finally, they left for Moscow, where their descendants (the Rzhevsky family) have become comic characters of many a joke. In the meantime, the town was occupied for a short space by Tver, Poland-Lithuania, and finally by the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\n\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Rzhev was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and Rzhev was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. In 1775, Rzhevsky Uyezd was established, with the center in Rzhev.\nIn the 18th century, local merchants, mainly of Old Believer confession, brought a great measure of prosperity to the town.\n\nOn 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Rzhevsky District with the administrative center in the town of Rzhev was established. It belonged to Rzhev Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 29 January 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Rzhev was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.\n\nDuring World War II, Rzhev was occupied by German troops from 14 October 1941 to 3 March 1943. More than one-sixth of the population was sent off to forced labor in Germany during the Nazi occupation and some nine thousand residents were shot, starved, or tortured to death in a concentration camp set up in the center of town. During this occupation, the general area of Rzhev, Sychyovka and Vyazma was the site of a set of major military operations between the Red Army and Nazi German military forces. These operations, which resulted in a great loss of civilian and military life, are commonly referred to as the Battles of Rzhev and almost completely wiped out the population of the town. Almost no old architecture survived these battles.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Rzhev serves as the administrative center of Rzhevsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Rzhev Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Rzhev Okrug is incorporated as Rzhev Urban Okrug.\n\nRzhev produces most of the cranes used in constructing apartment buildings and shopping malls in Moscow.\n\nThe railway which connects Moscow and Riga runs through Rzhev. Another railway connecting Torzhok with Vyazma via Rzhev, crosses it from north to south. There is passenger railway traffic.\n\nThe M9 highway connecting Moscow with Riga also passes Rzhev. Two other roads connect Rzhev with Tver via Staritsa and with Ostashkov via Selizharovo. There are also local roads with bus traffic originating from Rzhev.\n\nThe Volga is navigable, however, there is no passenger navigation.\n\nIt was home to the Rzhev and Bakhmutovo air bases during the Cold War.\n\nRzhev contains 15 cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally 72 objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments include the Church of John the Baptist (also known as the Okovtsy Church) built in the 19th century, monuments to soldiers and civilians fallen in World War II, as well as a number of archeological sites.\n\nThere is a local museum in Rzhev. As a highly controversial move, in 2013 the Joseph Stalin Museum was opened in a building where Joseph Stalin had spent one night in 1943 while inspecting the troops. , the museum did not have regular opening hours and was only open by appointment, trying to keep a low profile.\n\nRzhev is twinned with:\n\n"}

The town is noted for giving its name to the Battenberg family, a morganatic branch of the ruling House of Hesse-Darmstadt, and through it, the name Mountbatten used by members of the British royal family, a literal translation of Battenberg.\n\nThe centre of Battenberg lies in the \"Ederbergland\", or Eder Highland, to which the Burgwald abutting the town to the east also belongs, on the southern edge of the Sauerland and the Rothaargebirge. Lying between 320 and 650 m above sea level, the town is also crossed by the river Eder.\n\nBattenberg borders in the north on the community of Bromskirchen, in the northeast on the community of Allendorf, in the southeast on the community of Burgwald (all three in Waldeck-Frankenberg), in the south on the community of Münchhausen am Christenberg (Marburg-Biedenkopf), and in the west on the towns of Hatzfeld (Waldeck-Frankenberg) and Bad Berleburg (Siegen-Wittgenstein in North Rhine-Westphalia).\n\nBattenberg includes the following centres:\n\n\nIn 778 fighting took place near Laisa and Battenfeld as part of Charlemagne's Saxon Wars. A branch of the Wittgenstein noble family began calling themselves the \"Counts of Battenberg\" in 1214 – compare Sayn-Wittgenstein. In 1232, Battenberg had its first documentary mention, and two years later it was granted town rights. The early-Gothic church dates from 1249. In 1297, the town's ownership was transferred to the Archbishops of Mainz. In 1464, the \"Amt\" of Battenberg passed to Hesse. In 1932, Battenberg became part of the Frankenberg/Eder district. As part of municipal reform in 1974, the districts of Frankenberg (including Battenberg) and Waldeck united to form the district of Waldeck-Frankenberg.\n\nThe dynasty of the counts of Battenberg ceased to exist in 1314, their castle was demolished throughout the following centuries. When Prince Alexander von Hessen-Darmstadt, the brother of the grand duke of Hesse, married Julia von Hauke, the orphaned daughter of the former Deputy Minister of War of Congress Poland, their liaison was not considered befitting of his rank. Therefore her brother-in-law made her countess of Battenberg in 1851 and princess of Battenberg in 1858. With her husband, who agreed to carry the same title and name, she lived near Seeheim-Jugenheim at \"Schloss Heiligenberg\", a re-modelled manor. Her sons Ludwig Alexander and Heinrich Moritz both served the British empire, their families anglicized their name to Mountbatten (\"Berg\" means \"mountain, hill\" in German) in 1917.\n\nMunicipal elections held on 6 March 2016 apportioned the town council's 31 seats thus:\n\nBattenberg's civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: Per pale sable and argent.\n\nThe tinctures come from the arms borne by the town's old overlords, the Counts of Battenberg(a branch of the Counts of Wittgenstein). Battenberg's arms have their roots in the 13th century, putting them among Hesse's oldest municipal coats of arms.\n\nVarious other charges have appeared in the arms over the centuries, however. Sometimes it was a tower, the Count of Battenberg and the Archbishop of Mainz, the Archbishop by himself, or the Wheel of Mainz. One version even showed the same simple composition seen here, but with gules (red) instead of sable (black). This would have made the arms identical to those currently borne by Buchloe in Bavaria.\n\n\n\n\n"}

More precisely, serpentine soil contains minerals of the serpentine subgroup, especially antigorite, lizardite, and chrysotile or white asbestos, all of which are commonly found in ultramafic rocks. The term \"serpentine\" is commonly used to refer to both the soil type and the mineral group which forms its parent materials.\n\nSerpentine soils exhibit distinct chemical and physical properties and are generally regarded as poor soils. The soil is often reddish, brown, or gray in color due to its high iron and low organic content. Geologically, areas with serpentine bedrock are characteristically steep, rocky, and vulnerable to erosion, which causes many serpentine soils to be rather shallow. The shallow soils and sparse vegetation lead to elevated soil temperatures and dry conditions. Due to their ultramafic origin, serpentine soils also suffer from a low calcium-to-magnesium ratio and lack many essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Serpentine soils contain high concentrations of heavy metals, including chromium, iron, cobalt, and nickel. Together, these factors create serious ecological challenges for plants living in serpentine soils.\n\nSerpentinite is a meta-igneous rock formed by the metamorphic reaction of olivine-rich rock, peridotite, with water. Serpentinite has a mottled, greenish-gray or bluish-gray color and is often waxy to the touch. The rock often contains white streaks of chrysotile running through it, which are a type of naturally occurring asbestos. Asbestos is linked to an array of human health conditions such as mesothelioma from long time exposure of breathing in the dust particles. Caution should be taken when working in serpentine soils or when working with crushed serpentine rocks.\n\nSerpentinite most often forms in oceanic crust near the surface of the earth, particularly where water circulates in cooling rock near mid-ocean ridges: masses of the resulting ultramafic rock are found in ophiolites incorporated in continental crust near present and past tectonic plate boundaries.\n\nSerpentine soils are derived from ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are igneous or metamorphic rocks that contain more than 70% iron or magnesium. \n\nSerpentine soils are widely distributed on Earth, in part mirroring the distribution of ophiolites. There are outcroppings of serpentine soils in the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey, Alps, Cuba, and New Caledonia. In North America, serpentine soils also are present in small but widely distributed areas on the eastern slope of the Appalachian mountains in the eastern United States. However, California has the majority of the continent's serpentine soils.\n\nEcologically, serpentine soils have three main traits: poor plant productivity, high rates of endemism, and vegetation types which are distinct from neighboring areas. \n\nSerpentine plant communities range from moist bogs and fens to rocky barrens, and must be able to tolerate the harsh environmental conditions of such poor soil. As a result, they are often drastically different than non-serpentine soil areas bordering the serpentine soils. Vegetative characteristics are often shared among the types of flora found on serpentine soils. They will exhibit a \"stunted\" growth habit, with dull waxy, gray-green leaves (seen in \"Eriogonum libertini\"), which allow for water retention and sunlight reflection respectively. Other possible phenotypic traits include pigmented stems (as seen in the \"Streptanthus howellii\") and occasionally a carnivorous nature as seen in the \"Darlingtonia californica\". Some examples of common serpentine tolerant plants include: Gray Pine (\"Pinus sabiniana\"), California Lilac (\"Ceanothus sp.\"), Manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos sp.\"), Live-Oak (\"Quercus\" sp.), California Redbud (\"Cercis occidentalis\"), California Buckeye (\"Aesculus californica\"), and California laurel (Bay tree) (\"Umbellularia californica\"). \nAreas of serpentine soil are also home to diverse plants, many of which are rare or endangered species such as \"Acanthomintha duttonii\", \"Pentachaeta bellidiflora\", and \"Phlox hirsuta\". In California, 45% of the taxa associated with serpentine are rare or endangered. In California, shrubs such as leather oak (\"Quercus durata\") and coast whiteleaf manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos viscida\" ssp. \"pulchella\") are typical of serpentine soils.\n\nIn order to overcome the chemical and physical challenges presented by serpentine soils, plants have developed tolerances to drought, heavy metals, and limited nutrients. Low calcium:magnesium ratios cause limited root growth and root activity, weak cell membranes, and reduced uptake of essential nutrients. An adaptive mechanism to high magnesium soils allocates more resources to deep-growing roots. Heavy metals stunt growth, induce iron deficiency, cause chlorosis, and restrict root development. Multiple adaptive mechanisms to heavy metals include the exclusion of metals by restricting the uptake by the roots, compartmentalization of metals in various organs, or the development of toxicity tolerance. In nitrogen-poor sites, physiological effects on plants include impaired protein synthesis, chlorosis, reduced leaf turgor, reduced leaf and tiller number, reduced growth rate, and low seed yield. Low phosphorus levels cause similar effects of low nitrogen but also cause reduced seed size, lower root to shoot ratios, and increased water stress. Low soil moisture causes reduced nutrient uptake and transport, decreased stomatal opening and reduced photosynthetic capacity, and also reduces plant growth and productivity. Serpentine plants have strongly developed root systems to facilitate uptake of water and nutrients. For example, \"Noccaea fendleri\" (aka Fendler's penny grass) is a hyper-accumulator of nickel and \"Sedum laxum\" ssp. expresses succulence. In some cases, symbioses with serpentine tolerant ectomycorrhizal help facilitate plants’ adaptation to edaphic stressors on serpentine.\n\nAdaptation to serpentine soils has evolved multiple times. Serpentine tolerant plants are evolutionary younger than non-serpentine plants. The heterogeneity of serpentine communities coupled with their patchy distribution limits gene flow but promotes speciation and diversification. Habitat heterogeneity is an important contributor to the level of endemism and biodiversity in this system. Although the patchy distribution is attributed to the high rates of speciation in serpentine communities, there are a number of challenges associated with this. The spatial isolation from source and other populations limit gene flow, which could make these populations vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. In addition, there is high gene flow with the non-serpentine communities that can cause genotypic pollution, hybridization and nonviable offspring.\n\nThe unique plants that survive in serpentine soils have been used in the process of phytoremediation, a type of bioremediation. Since these plants developed specialized adaptations to high concentrations of heavy metals, they have been used to remove heavy metals from polluted soil.\n\n\"Serpentine barrens\" are a unique ecoregion found in parts of the United States in small but widely distributed areas of the Appalachian Mountains and the Coast Ranges of California, Oregon, and Washington. Species-rich archipelagos of communities comprise 1.5% of the state's land area. In California, 10% of the state's plants are serpentine endemics. The barrens occur on outcrops of altered ultramafic ophiolites.\n\nThey are named for minerals of the serpentine group, resulting in \"serpentine soils\", with unusually high concentrations of iron, chromium, nickel and cobalt. Serpentine barrens often consist of grassland or savannas in areas where the climate would normally lead to the growth of forests.\n\nSerpentine soils can be amended to support crops and pasture land for cattle grazing. This can be done by adding ample amounts of gypsum to the soil. By adding gypsum the soil pH (potential hydrogen) can be potentially leveled, creating an environment where more plant nutrients are in their available state. This however poses a possible implication to grazing cattle. An article from the “Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology” discerned that 20% of the grazing animals had toxic levels of nickel in their kidneys, and 32% had toxic levels of copper in their liver (Miranda et al. 2009). Further study is needed to see if this will potentially have a negative effect on human health as it pertains to beef consumption.\n\nSoldiers Delight Natural Environmental Area in Baltimore County, Maryland, covers 1,900 acres of serpentine barren. The area has over 38 rare, threatened and endangered plant species; as well as rare insects, rocks and minerals.\nRock Springs Nature Preserve in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is a property conserved by the Lancaster County Conservancy that is a prime example of a serpentine barren. It was originally a grassland, but fire suppression led to the conversion of the area to forest. This barren contains the rare serpentine aster, as well as a number of rare species of moths and skippers.\n\nIn Chester County, Pennsylvania, the Nottingham Park, aka Serpentine Barrens, was recommended by UMCES as deserving of National Natural Landmark designation, on numerous grounds. They included supporting a number of rare and endemic species, an intact population of pitch pine, and also the site having historic significance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055118", "title": "WMUR-TV", "text": "WMUR-TV\n\nWMUR-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 9, is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Manchester, New Hampshire, United States. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications. WMUR-TV's studios are located on South Commercial Street in downtown Manchester, and its transmitter is located on the south peak of Mount Uncanoonuc in Goffstown.\n\nManchester is part of the larger Boston television market, making WMUR-TV part of a nominal duopoly with that city's ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV (channel 5); however, the two stations maintain separate operations. As a result, WMUR is the only New Hampshire-based television station with a news operation. In addition to WCVB-TV, WMUR-TV shares common coverage areas with four sister stations, the Portland, Maine duopoly of ABC affiliate WMTW and CW/MyNetworkTV affiliate WPXT; and the Burlington, Vermont duopoly of CW affiliate WNNE in Montpelier and Plattsburgh, New York-based NBC affiliate WPTZ.\n\nThe station signed on the air on March 28, 1954, as the first television station in New Hampshire. It was founded by former governor Francis P. Murphy, owner of WMUR radio (610 AM; now WGIR) through a company known as the Radio Voice of New Hampshire, Inc. Murphy beat out several challengers, including William Loeb III, publisher of the \"Manchester Union-Leader\". It broadcast from a Victorian-style house on Elm Street in Manchester, alongside its sister radio station. In addition to carrying ABC programming (the station having been affiliated with the network since its sign-on), WMUR aired daily newscasts, local game shows and movies.\n\nIn 1955, channel 9 boosted its signal significantly, providing a strong signal extending well into the Boston area. Murphy was well aware of this and began airing programming that had previously not been available in Boston. The following year, however, Murphy decided to retire. While a buyer was found immediately for the AM station, there were few takers for channel 9. Finally, in early 1957, he agreed in principle to sell WMUR-TV to Storer Broadcasting. However, Storer came under fire when it announced plans to move the station's transmitter to just outside Haverhill, Massachusetts—only north of Boston; approval of the move would likely have resulted in the station taking the CBS affiliation from WNAC-TV (channel 7, now occupied by the present-day WHDH) as Storer had very good relations with CBS. It soon became apparent that Storer intended to move all of channel 9's operations across the border to Massachusetts and reorient it as the Boston market's third VHF station. The outcry led regulators to reject Storer's request to build a new tower near Haverhill. Storer then backed out of the deal, and the station remained in Murphy's hands until his death in December 1958. His estate finally sold the station a few months later to Richard Eaton's United Broadcasting. Storer eventually fulfilled their Boston ambitions in 1966 with the purchase of the channel 38 license as WSBK-TV.\n\nSoon after taking over, United laid off all but nine of WMUR's employees and reduced local programming to its two daily newscasts. For the next 22 years, United ran channel 9 on a shoestring budget, devoting most of its efforts to managing Manchester's cable franchise. It paid almost no attention to the station even as equipment broke down. The studio's upkeep also suffered; the floor was so slanted that cameras rolled on their own. WMUR continued to broadcast in black-and-white until 1973, long after the Boston stations had all upgraded to color capability. Two of the few things the station had going for it during this period were \"The Uncle Gus Show\", hosted by Gus Bernier for more than 20 years, and an increasingly active news department led by Tom Bonnar and Fred Kocher.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Eaton's entire chain of radio and television stations, including WMUR, were under constant scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In the cases involving two other television stations: WOOK-TV/Washington, D.C. and WMET-TV/Baltimore; as well as two other radio stations: WOOK (AM)/Washington and WFAB/Miami, their licenses were revoked entirely, each for different reasons. (An administrative law judge recommended the licensesd of two other radio stations, WJMO (1490 AM) and WCUY (92.3 FM) in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, be revokedby , but this was not acted upon by the commission due to Eaton's death in June 1981.) WMUR, KECY-TV/El Centro, California and WMET-TV were investigated over allegations of bribery by Eaton of ABC-TV employees so WMUR and KECY would get more favorable terms in their ABC affiliations contracts.\n\nThe station continued to be run very cheaply into the early 1980s, but a change in ownership marked the beginning of a new era for WMUR.\n\nIn July 1981, following Richard Eaton's death, WMUR was sold to Columbus, Mississippi, businessman Birney Imes Jr. and his company, Imes Communications, which also owned that city's WCBI-TV, as well as WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Years later, several veterans, including Bonnar, said they only stayed at the station in hopes a wealthier owner would see its potential. Imes made WMUR a significant influence in New Hampshire by giving it a badly-needed technical overhaul, as well as upgrading its news department.\n\nIn September 1987, the station moved from its original Elm Street studios to facilities in the historic Millyard area of the city.\n\nIn 1994, WMUR became both a primary and secondary affiliate of Fox. They also launched three low-powered repeaters in the northern portion of New Hampshire, one of them (W38CB in Littleton) carried WMUR's full ABC schedule, while the other two (W27BL in Berlin and WMUR-LP in Littleton) were full-time primary affiliates of Fox. All of them, including its main channel, carried WMUR's newscasts as well as Fox Sports telecasts. While WMUR and W38CB managed to retain their full-time ABC schedule, W27BL/WMUR-LP offered a different lineup than that of WMUR's actual lineup. Even though W27BL/WMUR-LP retained WMUR's newscasts and some of its syndicated fare, the ABC programs were replaced with additional syndicated programming, as well as programs from Fox itself. This included Fox Sports' telecasts, the Fox Kids children's block, and the network's full primetime lineup. WMUR-LP was the only Fox affiliate to serve a portion of the Burlington–Plattsburgh media market until WFFF-TV began broadcasting on August 31, 1997. However, on December 19, 2001, WMUR dropped its primary/secondary affiliation with Fox after the Hearst acquisition (Hearst has never affiliated any of their stations with Fox, a rarity in American broadcasting), and has since replaced the full Fox lineup on W27BL/WMUR-LP with a full-time simulcast of WMUR's ABC programming.\n\nIn 1995, WMUR purchased land and a building at its current location. This building was rebuilt as an state-of-the-art broadcast center; it moved to this new location in January 1996.\n\nWMUR was the first television station in the country to develop a significant Internet presence beginning on October 8, 1995. It was the first television station to hire a full-time employee dedicated to streaming its newscast live and archived online for later viewing. It was also the first television station to use the Internet to supplement its broadcast news by posting additional information online like the Megan's Law list. After posting a 3D virtual tour of its TV studio facilities online, it briefly became the most visited attraction online in the world. Beginning in 1998, the station made significant financial, technical and staff investments into its Internet strategy. This included 24-hour original news segments, weather coverage by a professional meteorologist and sales executive dedicated to TV and online advertising. In 2000, WMUR, CNN and WMUR.com simulcasted the New Hampshire primary debates held at the TV station. This was the first widely promoted and executed worldwide live streaming video event.\n\nIn September 2000, Imes Communications reached an agreement to sell the station to Emmis Communications, who then traded WMUR to Hearst-Argyle Television, now Hearst Television, in exchange for that company's three radio stations in Phoenix, Arizona—KTAR, KMVP, and KKLT. In 2004, WMUR-TV celebrated fifty years of broadcasting.\n\nOn September 24, 2005, WMUR became available on satellite via DirecTV in Coös, Carroll, Grafton, and Sullivan counties in northern and west-central New Hampshire. Coös and Carroll counties are part of the Portland, Maine, market and thus had WMTW as their ABC affiliate, while Grafton and Sullivan counties are part of the Burlington–Plattsburgh market and hence received ABC programming from WVNY; these areas had no source of in-state news until WMUR's uplinking.\n\nThe station was featured in a fictional manner in the sixth season of \"The West Wing\". Congressman Matt Santos, running in the Democratic Presidential primary, went to the WMUR studios to run a live ad for his campaign.\n\nThe station's digital signal began broadcasting on UHF channel 59 in November 1998. WMUR's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.\n\nIn February 2010, WMUR introduced a new slogan, \"It's how you know.\" This slogan often promoted its local news, weather, its photo-sharing site, \"uLocal\", and other ideas of interest that would lead to its website. WMUR's Hearst-owned sister stations KCRA and KSBW also used this slogan, which was seen at the beginning of each video segment on YouTube.\n\nIn July 2012, during a retransmission consent dispute, Hallmark Movie Channel was a substitute for Hearst Television's ABC affiliates, WMUR-TV and WMTW on Time Warner Cable.\n\nIn December 2015, the Democratic National Committee announced that WMUR would not be included as a co-sponsor of the Democratic debate due to a labor dispute between that station and its unionized employees.\n\nManchester is about north from Boston while Concord is about . Boston's VHF stations have Grade A signals in Manchester and Grade B signals in Concord, while the UHF stations have Grade B signals in Manchester but spotty signals in Concord. On paper, southern New Hampshire is large enough to be a market in its own right. If it were ever to break off from Boston, it would rank in the top 100 of all U.S. media markets. However, CBS' ownership of WBZ-TV (channel 4) makes this unlikely as it would result in the dilution of that station's advertising revenue, along with viewer upheaval at the loss of newscasts from the Boston area. This has been seen when Providence's stations in the southern portion of the Boston market attempted to claim market exclusivity resulting in some complaints from area cable customers. In the early 1990s, that station operated a news bureau in Manchester which was re-established on Elm Street in November 2006.\n\nPrior to 1988, the sub-market was served by WMUR and PBS member station WENH-TV (which was part of the New Hampshire Public Television state network). On February 1, 1988, WNHT (channel 21, now occupied by WPXG-TV), an independent station based in Concord, became southern New Hampshire's first CBS affiliate and began to produce local newscasts. WNHT lost the affiliation and ceased operations on March 31, 1989, due to insufficient viewership. There has not been a CBS affiliate in the state since then. The situation with WMUR and sister station WCVB is not unlike that of WHAG-TV in Hagerstown, Maryland, which operated as an NBC affiliate until 2016 even though it is part of the Washington, D.C., market and competed with that city's NBC owned-and-operated station, WRC-TV.\n\nWhen WNHT shut down, WMUR and WENH remained the only full-power stations licensed in the state until MyNetworkTV launched on September 5, 2006. On that date, WZMY-TV (channel 50, now WWJE-DT), an independent station based in Derry, became the southern New Hampshire and Boston affiliate of the network; it remained affiliated with MyNetworkTV (which has since transitioned into a programming service rather than a network) until September 2011, when the service moved to Boston-based WSBK-TV (channel 38).\n\nExcept for WRLH out of Lebanon, which operated from 1966 to 1976, there has never been an NBC station based in the state. WRLH returned to the air in 1978 as WNNE, now based in White River Junction, Vermont. WNNE broadcast NBC programming into parts of western New Hampshire from then until it moved to Montpelier, Vermont, in 2018. Much of this area is considered part of the Burlington–Plattsburgh market, although WMUR is still available. The rest of the state receives NBC from that network's affiliates in either Boston or Portland. On January 1, 2017, Merrimack-licensed Telemundo owned-and-operated station WNEU (channel 60) began simulcasting NBC programming via its new Boston O&O WBTS-LD (channel 8, now Telemundo O&O WYCN-LD in Providence) on its second digital subchannel; however, the new station, known on-air as NBC Boston, is focused on Boston and eastern Massachusetts rather than New Hampshire. NBC also operates WBTS-CD (channel 15), licensed to serve Nashua; however, it broadcasts over the Needham, Massachusetts, transmitter of Boston-based WGBX-TV (channel 44) under a channel sharing agreement. There were no WB or UPN affiliates in the state during the existence of those networks; likewise, The CW does not have any affiliates in New Hampshire, and the state receives Fox from the network's affiliates in Boston, Massachusetts, Portland, Maine, or Burlington, Vermont.\n\nWMUR has always promoted the fact that it is the only local television news source in the state; the station's slogan since 2002—\"No One Covers New Hampshire Like We Do\"—reflects this. At various points, channel 50 (as WNDS, WZMY-TV, and WBIN-TV) and WGOT (channel 60, now WNEU), as well as the aforementioned WNHT, have offered New Hampshire-focused local newscasts in competition with WMUR; the most recent of these operations, on WBIN-TV, was cancelled in 2017 after that station sold its spectrum in an FCC auction, leaving WMUR once again as the only television news source in New Hampshire.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn October 3, 2011, WMUR added sub-channel 9.2 with programming from classic television network MeTV.\n\nSince August 22, 1994, WMUR has operated three repeaters in northern New Hampshire. Until December 19, 2001, two of the stations were primarily affiliated with Fox but simulcast channel 9's newscasts and some syndicated programs (the third repeater carried all WMUR programming, including ABC network programs). The two Fox stations started simulcasting WMUR when WMTW (at that time separately owned) relocated its transmitter away from Mount Washington. Since all three stations are low-powered, they were exempt from the transition to digital-only broadcasting on June 12, 2009.\n\nSyndicated programming seen on WMUR includes \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", \"Tamron Hall\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", and \"25 Words or Less\". Many of these programs are also seen on sister station WCVB-TV (\"Kelly Clarkson\" is instead shared with WBTS-CD), though the two stations air most of these programs in different time slots.\n\nWMUR was one of the longest-serving affiliates of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's \"Love Network\", having carried \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\" and its successors annually on Labor Day and/or the night before since the late 1960s. MDA moved the telethon from syndication to ABC in 2013 as the \"MDA Show of Strength\"; as a result, WMUR continued to broadcast the program for two more years until the telethon ended in 2014.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, one of the station's well-known local programs was a weekday children's program known as \"The Uncle Gus Show\". Unlike Boston's astronaut Major Mudd or the widely franchised Bozo, host Uncle Gus Bernier wore no costume except an angler's hat. For many years, WMUR's nighttime sign-off was accompanied by \"New Hampshire Naturally\" by The Shaw Brothers. The music was synchronized to bucolic scenes of a fly fisherman casting his line into a mountain stream, a covered bridge, the Old Man of the Mountain, flowers, fall foliage and other images. This theme was replaced at some point by \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nWMUR-TV broadcasts 30½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). In addition, WMUR produces \"New Hampshire Chronicle\", a regional version of the \"Chronicle\" newsmagazine series that originated on Boston sister station WCVB-TV, which airs weeknights at 7:00 p.m.; and the political talk program \"Close Up\", which airs on Sunday mornings at 10:00 a.m.\n\nDuring election seasons, WMUR is well known for organizing and producing candidate debates for ABC News, as well as CNN, before the first United States presidential primary; the debates have been held at Saint Anselm College. In addition to its main studios, WMUR operates two news bureaus in New Hampshire. The station's Lakes Region Bureau is based at The Inn at Bay Point in Meredith, and the Seacoast Bureau is based at Harbor Place in Portsmouth. In addition, WMUR and WCVB share news footage for stories occurring within the other station's coverage area; WCVB also operates a live truck for news gathering that is based at WMUR's studios in Manchester.\n\nAudio simulcasts of WMUR's newscasts are broadcast on WTPL (107.7 FM) in Hillsborough and WTSL (1400 AM) in Hanover (weekdays from 5:00 am to 6:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.), WTSN (1270 AM) in Dover (from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.), WASR (1420 AM) in Wolfeboro (5 to 6 p.m.) and WEEY (93.5 FM) in Keene (from 5:00 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.). In lieu of its own weather radar, WMUR uses live radar data from several regional sites operated by the National Weather Service. During weather segments, the radar system used by WMUR that utilizes this data is presented on-screen as \"Storm Watch 9 Storm Tracker\", which is provided through a graphics system by Weather Services International. A live video feed of this radar is offered on WMUR's website. During instances of severe weather year-round, the station may extend local newscasts to provide coverage; this coverage is sometimes streamed live on the website.\n\nOn August 2, 2011, WMUR began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition and introduced a new set and graphics package, which are styled differently from those of WCVB to avert any confusion between the two stations (along with its news music). WMUR began producing a half-hour weeknight 10:00 p.m. newscast for its MeTV subchannel on March 5, 2012, which competed with a 10:00 p.m. newscast on WBIN-TV until early 2017, when that station went off the air as a result of the FCC's spectrum auction. On November 5, 2018, WMUR introduced another new graphics package, this time for the full widescreen presentation, but like the previous version, they are styled differently from those of WCVB to avert any confusion between the two stations (and their other sister stations that have a news operation).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055124", "title": "Vermilion Range (Minnesota)", "text": "Vermilion Range (Minnesota)\n\nThe Vermilion Range exists between Tower and Ely, Minnesota, and contains significant deposits of iron ore. Together with the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges, these three constitute the Iron Ranges of northern Minnesota; they were deposited in the Animikie Group. While the Mesabi Range had iron ore close enough to the surface to enable pit mining, mines had to be dug deep underground to reach the ore of the Vermilion and Cuyuna ranges. The Soudan mine was nearly 1/2 mile underground and required blasting of Precambrian sedimentary bedrock.\n\nThe banded iron formation in the range consists of a \"interbedded sequence\" of chert, magnetite and hematite. Eleven mines operated in the range, with five in the Ely area. The Ely Trough, a synclinal fold, produced 70 million metric tons from the Chandler, Pioneer, Zenith, Sibley and Savoy mines. The largest mine in the range, Soudan, was closed in 1962, and the last mine in the Ely area closed in 1964.\n\nDespite the effort needed for the deep mining Soudan mine, the ore obtained was worth the effort; the quality of the hematite ore was so pure that two pieces could be welded. The bedrock, known as taconite, also contained iron, but in a much lower concentration. After more efficient practices for creating steel were discovered, the use of this high-quality ore was abandoned due to its more costly mining expense.\n\nThe Soudan hematite was used in the open hearth furnace, where the density of the ore, called Vermilion Lump, was needed to break through the floating slag to cause the molten charge to roil and burn off the impurities. When the newer blast furnaces came into use, the expensive Vermilion Lump was no longer needed. New processes were developed to extract the iron from the taconite by using open-pit mining. This method produced ore at a significantly reduced cost. Once proven successful, the technical change resulted in Minnesota's iron industry centering on the Mesabi Range, where the taconite was much easier to access.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055131", "title": "Trocadero, San Francisco", "text": "Trocadero, San Francisco\n\nIn San Francisco, California, at the turn of the 20th century, the Trocadero was a lively roadhouse, offering gambling at roulette tables and dancing, as well as the best trout pond in California. It was opened in 1892, in a wooden building that had been brought around the Horn and was by reputation the first house built in San Francisco west of Twin Peaks, on the \"rancho\" of the Greene family. The first seeds of Australian eucalyptus had been sown here, about 1871. Appropriately, it was at the Trocadero that Abe Ruef was found hiding, after his indictment in the notorious municipal graft trials of 1907. In the 1930s, Bernard Maybeck recast the Trocadero Inn into a children's playground and renamed it the Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove.\n\nThe stylish connotations of the name \"Trocadero\" derive from the Battle of Trocadero in southern Spain, a citadel held by liberal Spanish forces that was taken by the French troops sent by Charles X, in 1823. The battle was commemorated in the Place du Trocadéro, Paris, and the monumental glamor of the Parisian site has given rise to a variety of locales bearing its name.\n\nIn London, the Trocadero Restaurant of J. Lyons and Co. opened in 1896 in Shaftesbury Avenue, near the theatres of the West End. It offered a magnificent Opera Baroque style, and the various trocaderos of the English-speaking world have derived their names from this original, the epitome of grand Edwardian catering. \n\nConsequently, Trocadero is the name of several restaurants and clubs throughout the world: see Trocadero (disambiguation).\n\nIn San Francisco, \"Trocadero\" continued to have a connotation of stylish nighttime fun. In its heyday, the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Trocadero Transfer was regarded as the best hard-core—and largely gay—disco on the West Coast. It was among the half-dozen musical style-setters in the country.\n\n"}

Ermine Street would have first crossed the river here via a ford, believed to be some way to the west of the present bridge. Edward the Elder built a wooden bridge in the early 10th century a few yards to the west of the current bridge, and also ordered the nearby Huntingdon Castle to be rebuilt. Until the 1107 construction of the first bridge in St Ives, it is believed that there was no bridge further downstream, and foreign trade would navigate the river as far upstream as Huntingdon.\n\nResponsibility for the bridge's repair was for centuries a matter of dispute. In 1259 a court ruling finally ordered that the county should pay to keep it repaired in return for rendering the bridge toll-free. Nonetheless, the bridge remained in a poorly maintained state, and by 1329 was declared to be in severe danger of collapse.\n\nThe current bridge was constructed around 1332, with work starting on both banks or the river. The slight kink near the central pier was a result of the lack of alignment of the two halves. Consisting of six arches and faced with ashlar, the parapets which form recesses for pedestrians, are triangular in shape on the north side, and semi-hexagonal on the south.\n\nIt was intended for both pedestrian and horse-drawn transport (the bridge has recesses for people to stand to let the heavier traffic pass), but now serves exclusively for light vehicular traffic. Pedestrians use a parallel footbridge just metres upstream, and heavy goods vehicles must use the modern bridge, which forms part of the A14 bypass. However, until that was built in 1975, the narrow medieval bridge stood alone, and had to be used by both lorries travelling the Great North Road and footgoing shoppers, to the dissatisfaction of all parties.\n\nThe bridge is now Grade I listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nIn 2006 an entire portion of parapet was struck by traffic and plunged into the river, the repair has been done to English Heritage standard.\n\n"}

J. Maling of West Herrington, County Durham; and the cousin of William Ward and William George Ward. He was born in London on 27 February 1797. Educated at Harrow School, and sent abroad to learn languages, he became in 1816 attaché to the British legation at Stockholm, under Sir Edward Thornton. He was transferred to The Hague in 1818, and to Madrid in 1819. He was appointed joint commissioner to Mexico in October 1823, and returned to England in 1824; again went out to Mexico in 1825, as \"chargé d'affaires\", but returned and retired from the diplomatic service in 1827.\n\nIn December 1832 Ward entered the House of Commons, elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for St Albans, and sitting for that seat until 1837; and then for Sheffield from 1837 to 1849. His reputation was as an advanced liberal, and he regarded classical economics as authoritative, as witnessed by his opposition to the Ten Hours Bill.\n\nWard's career in Parliament was marked by his hostility to the Church of Ireland, on which he moved a yearly resolution. The first occasion for this motion, that \"That the protestant episcopal establishment in Ireland exceeds the spiritual wants of the protestant population\", was 27 May 1834, and it was particularly significant in British politics: it was brought at a time when the cabinet of Earl Grey was deeply divided on Irish issues. The timing owed to the prompting of Lord Durham, who wished to see an administration of a more Radical complexion. On the same day Lord Ripon, Edward Stanley, Sir James Graham, and the Duke of Richmond resigned office because they could not support the appointment of an Irish church commission. Ward had given notice of the motion, but behind the scenes the Cabinet could not agree a common approach, and a number of them had audiences with the King. A group around Edward Ellice saw this as the occasion for Stanley and Graham to quit the administration. The outcome was only resolved late in the evening, when Stanley and Graham were already gone, and the Marquess of Lansdowne threatened to resign himself unless Viscount Althorp did as he was told by Grey, moving an adjournment of the motion in the Commons, while proposing an enquiry into the Irish church. On 2 June Ward's motion was voted down by 396 to 120.\n\nWard was strongly opposed to Chartism, which he saw starkly in terms of class conflict; but also took up the cause of the secret ballot, one Chartist demand. George Grote had introduced a motion on it in 1833, and up to 1839 there had been increasing support, with Thomas Babington Macaulay arguing on its side. Ward continued the series of motions in 1842, when Grote no longer was an MP.\n\nWard was First Secretary of the Admiralty from 1846 to 1849. He spoke in Parliament in defence of William Symonds, attacked in 1848 by the Radical MPs John MacGregor and Joseph Hume on grounds of profligate expenditure, putting the case that dockyard spending had seen retrenchment.\n\nWard bought from Charles Buller and Henry Cole the loss-making \"Weekly Chronicle\", and used it to campaign for his views.\n\nWard supported the colonisation aims and methods of Edward Gibbon Wakefield; and was a committee member of the South Australian Association set up in 1834 by Wakefield, with Buller and Grote, and also William Clay, Rowland Hill, William Molesworth, Southwood Smith, Henry Warburton and William Wolryche-Whitmore. Ward chaired the 1836 select committee on Disposal of Lands in the British Colonies. The other members of the committee were Francis Baring, Henry Lytton Bulwer, William Ewart Gladstone, George Grey, William Hutt, John Arthur Roebuck, and George Poulett Scrope. Eleven witnesses were called, but colonists were not well represented among them, and Wakefield was given a platform for his views. The committee's report was in effect an endorsement of the \"Wakefield system\" and its recent implementation in Australasia.\n\nWard was also on the committee of the New Zealand Association set up in 1837, with a number of the same people; and brought resolutions to Parliament on colonisation in June 1839. The initiative then floundered in face of opposition from Lord John Russell and Robert Vernon Smith in the Commons, and from Tories, with widespread indifference. Ward and Hutt supported William Smith O'Brien on colonisation in Wakefield's style in June 1840, but the House was not convinced of the practicality of further schemes and disliked the expense.\n\nIn the days of the early speculation, Ward was much involved with railway enterprises. He spoke in Parliament on the detrimental effect of the seekers of stag profit who invested, often fraudulently, in public offerings of railway shares; he put a figure of only 40% on the allocation to \"genuine\" investors. After a period in which he had put his own finances on a sounder basis, he lost heavily in the Railway Mania of 1846. Those close to the family believed he had dissipated the large fortune that had come from his Plumer stepmother.\n\nIn May 1849 Ward was appointed Lord High Commissioner to the Ionian Islands, a post he held to 1855. The islands were then under the protection of the British Crown. He arrived at Corfu on 2 June 1849, found the local assembly unworkable and prorogued it. On 1 August 1849 he proclaimed an amnesty to those who had taken part in the rebellion in Cephalonia against his predecessor, Lord Seaton. By the end of August there was a fresh insurgency; he went to Cephalonia, and suppressed it by October. His actions were criticised in the House of Commons. The rest of his time was more peaceful, but Ward used his prerogative powers freely to banish newspaper editors of papers and members of the assembly. He left on 13 April 1855.\n\nWard on 11 May 1855 became governor of Ceylon. His first speech, that year, dealt with railways; he developed also economic policy on communications and telegraphy, and immigrant labour. He also consolidated the public administration. On the outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857 he despatched all the European troops in the colony to Bengal.\n\nHe succeeded Sir Charles Trevelyan as Governor of Madras in June 1860 but served in that capacity only for a few weeks until his death from cholera on 2 August, aged 63. He is buried in St. Mary's Church, Madras.\n\nWard was made a G.C.M.G. in 1849. A statue was erected to him at Kandy.\n\nWard published two books about Mexico, illustrated by his wife. In \"Mexico in 1827\" (1828) he tried to present a balanced view of the prospects for the country, formally independent from Spain in 1821. He gave an analysis of Mexico's mines, and was rather negative about the competence of William Bullock who had a mining concession from the Mexican government. He was also critical of attempts to finance pearl diving.\n\nIn \"The First Step to a Poor Law for Ireland\" (1837), Ward argued that large-scale emigration, sponsored by the state, was a precondition for the introduction of the workhouse system in Ireland.\n\nA volume of his \"Speeches and Minutes\" in Ceylon appeared at Colombo in 1864.\n\nWard married, in 1824, Emily Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Swinburne, 6th Baronet, of Capheaton Hall. Their eldest son, Dudley Ward, became a judge in New Zealand, and the second son, Swinburne Ward was a diplomat and amateur naturalist.\n\n\n\n"}

It lies along a line between Brainerd, Minnesota, and Aitkin, Minnesota. The width ranges from 1 to 10 miles.\n\nThough covered by Pleistocene glacial drift up to 200 feet thick, 1859 surveyors noted compass deflection while in the area. The range was surveyed by Cuyler Adams, using a dip needle in 1895. With partners, he located ore by drilling in 1903. The word \"Cuyuna\" is an amalgamation of the first three letters of Cuyler's name with \"Una\", the name of his dog. \n\nThe Kennedy mine shaft reached ore in April 1908 and the first shipment was made via rail on 11 April 1911. Open pit mining started at the Rowe mine in 1912. In addition to the iron, the ore was rich in manganese, which was useful during World War I, with 32 mines operating.\n\nAt the height of the mining, the Cuyuna Range was the location of the worst mining disaster in Minnesota, the Milford Mine disaster. On February 5, 1924, a new tunnel was blasted too close to nearby Foley Lake, and water rushed in, killing 41 miners.\n\nMining on the range continued until 1984. Also like the Vermilion Range, mining slowed as it became more economical to extract taconite deposits from the Mesabi Range, which were closer to the surface. Additionally, the surface mines were safer than the mines deep underground.\n\nCuyuna Country State Recreation Area now occupies portions of the range where mining pits and rock deposit stockpiles were left behind by the miners. The Cuyuna Lakes Trail is also located near the former mines.\n\nThe rocks in the district consist of tightly folded layers parallel to the axis of the Lake Superior Syncline. These folds trend to the northeast. The rocks have been slightly metamorphosed. \n\nThe main iron ore bearing formation is the middle Precambrian Trommald Formation, which belongs in the Animikie Group. This is a chert containing oxidized iron in the form of hematite and goethite. Some clastic quartz sands and argillaceous layers. The agate variant Binghamite is found only in the Cuyuna Range.\n\n\n\n"}

At a minimum, this means reducing its viscosity so that it can be pumped through pipelines (bitumen is 1000x more viscous than light crude oil). However this process often also includes separating out heavy fractions and reducing sulfur, nitrogen and metals like nickel and vanadium.\n\nUpgrading may involve multiple processes:\n\n\nResearch into using biotechnology to perform some of these processes at lower temperatures and cost is ongoing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2055150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055150", "title": "Mona Passage", "text": "Mona Passage\n\nThe Mona Passage () is a strait that separates the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. The Mona Passage connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea, and is an important shipping route between the Atlantic and the Panama Canal.\n\nThe stretch of sea between the four islands is one of the most difficult passages in the Caribbean. It is fraught with variable tidal currents created by the large islands on either side of it, and by sand banks that extend out for many miles from both coasts.\n\nThere are three islands in the Mona Passage:\n\n\nThe Passage was the site of a devastating earthquake and resulting tsunami that hit western Puerto Rico in 1918. It is the site of frequent small earthquakes. The passage is underlain by a seismically active rift zone that overprints an older partly eroded tilted-block structure. Desecheo Island sits on the Desecheo ridge, a narrow east–west ridge that extends west from the northwest corner of Puerto Rico. The ridge forms the southern boundary of the 4000 m deep Mona rift which extends toward the north to the strike slip fault zones which bound Puerto Rico and Hispanola. The east face of the rift has a sharp relief of 3 km and is controlled by the N - S trending Mona Rift Fault. The epicenter of the 1918 earthquake was located along the east or southeast edge of the Mona Rift.\n\nThe Mona Passage connects the Atlantic Ocean waters and Caribbean Sea waters, above a sill depth of 400 to 500 meters. The sill runs along a northwest to southeast direction between Cabo Engaño (DR) in the west and the Cabo Rojo Shelf (PR) in the east margin of the Mona Passage. The vertical profile of the low-frequency (periods longer than 2 days) mean meridional water transport is characterized by a two-layer structure. The upper layer lies above a depth of 300 meters, with the upper water masses, the Caribbean Surface Water, Subtropical Underwater and Sargasso Sea Water entering the Caribbean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. Below this layer, the Tropical Central Water exits toward the Atlantic Ocean. The mean value for the meridional (North-South) transport for a sampled year was -1.85 ± 0.25 Sverdrup (Sv) into the Caribbean Sea.\nThe barotropic tide (surface tide) propagates from northeast to southwest along Mona Passage. The \"principal lunar semi-diurnal\" constituent, also known as the \"M2\" (or \"M\") accounts for 52.35% of the total variance observed in the ocean currents and the semidiurnal current ellipses, with a clockwise rotation, are roughly aligned in a north–south direction.\n\nSemidiurnal tidal currents impinging on a submarine ridge known as \"El Pichincho\" can force the generation of an internal tide with a wave height of 40 meters.\n\nUnderwater glider observations reveal wave damping as the internal tide propagates south along the Mona Passage towards the open Caribbean Sea.\n\nInternal tides at \"El Pichincho\" can elevate the turbulent vertical diffusivity values (or Eddy diffusion), and with a reduction of the Richardson number at the base of the pycnocline. The development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability during the breaking of the internal tide can explain the formation of high diffusivity patches that generate a vertical flux of nitrate (NO) into the photic zone and can sustain new production locally.\n\nHigher values of primary productivity were observed near the wave trough, than those observed during periods of maximum solar irradiance at noon.\n\nImages from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and International Space Station (ISS) photography show the sea-surface manifestation of packets of internal solitons (or nonlinear internal waves) generated at \"Banco Engaño\", located at the northwest margin of the Mona Passage. \nThe packets propagate either into the Caribbean Sea or the Atlantic Ocean depending on the direction of the currents that forced their generation.\nSurface tides, internal tides, internal solitons, inertial currents and the low frequency water mass transport between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea make the Mona Passage a very dynamic environment.\n\nMost cruising boaters entering the Caribbean from the north do so via a stop at Samaná in the northeastern part of the Dominican Republic, then continuing across the Mona Passage to Puerto Rico without stopping. Under sail it means an even longer distance because of having to \"tack\" a zig-zag course into the easterly trade winds.\n\nAt the stop of Saona Island on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic, boaters can sit and wait for a lull in the trade winds when seas are down to start their eastward crossing. This is an advantage which is not possible when departing from Samaná. It is only about from Saona to the protected anchorage inside the barrier coral reef on the west coast of Mona Island. And from there it is another to the popular and spacious cruising anchorage at Boquerón in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n"}

The Sandinistas had agreed to support the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's hijacking in exchange for guerrilla warfare training. \n\nArgüello was born in San Francisco, California in March 1943, the son of Rodolfo Argüello Ruiz, a Nicaraguan national, and Kathleen Ryan, a US citizen. His family moved back to Nicaragua when he was 3, and lived in Momotombo, La Paz Centro, and Managua. In 1956, Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza García was assassinated. His surviving sons Luis and Anastasio launched nationwide reprisals. Argüello's family were part of an exodus of affluent Nicaraguans who fled the country. They left for Los Angeles.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Argüello attended Belmont Senior High School. As he grew older, he became increasingly resentful of the Somoza regime. Like many youths of the 1960s, he was fascinated by the Cuban Revolution and the figure of Che Guevara. In the years following high school, he saw many of his friends in the student movement beaten, arrested or killed.\n\nA graduate of UCLA, Argüello received a Fulbright scholarship to study medicine in Chile in 1967. This was during the time of political ferment that would culminate in the 1970 election of Socialist President Salvador Allende; Argüello was deeply affected by the deaths in August 1967 of several Nicaraguan friends who were members of the Sandinista guerrilla movement of Pancasan, as well as the death of Che Guevara in Bolivia two months later.\n\nWhen he returned to Nicaragua, he attempted to collaborate with the Sandinista National Liberation Front. However, Sandinista leader Carlos Fonseca distrusted Argüello's American background, suspected him of being an infiltrator, and had his participation limited. Argüello was exiled by the Somoza government in August 1969 for his anti-regime activities. He went to Geneva, Switzerland to work with other exiled Nicaraguans.\n\nIn early 1970, Sandinista leader Oscar Turcios made contact with the Marxist Fourth International in Western Europe, in the hopes of meeting other guerrilla groups who could offer needed military training to the Sandinista's fledgling movement. The Sandinistas first made contact with Nayef Hawatmeh's Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP). Argüello and several other Sandinistas were sent to PDFLP camps near Amman, Jordan to receive guerrilla training from April to June 1970. Two other Nicaraguans who trained with Argüello were Juan Jose Quezada (killed in Nicaragua in 1973) and Pedro Arauz Palacios (killed in Nicaragua in 1977).\n\nIn Leila Khaled's memoirs, it is alleged that Argüello fathered three children. However, in Marshall Yurow's biographical study of Patrick Argüello, he found no evidence to substantiate this claim.\n\nIn the summer of 1970, Argüello and a small group of Nicaraguan Sandinista émigrés made contact with a different faction of the Palestinian guerrilla movement, George Habbash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The Nicaraguans wanted additional guerrilla training. The price the PFLP asked for the promised training was Nicaraguan participation in the simultaneous hijackings of four European airliners in a bid to draw attention to the Palestinian issue.\n\nWhen two of their Palestinian co-conspirators were unable to board the targeted El Al Boeing 707 at Amsterdam on September 6, 1970, Argüello was left with only Leila Khaled, whom he had met only a week before and knew as \"Shadiah\", to help him hijack the plane. Posing as a married couple, they boarded the plane using Honduran passports—having passed through a security check of their luggage—seated in the second row of tourist-class. Just before they began their hijacking, Khaled told Argüello her actual identity, which impressed him. Thirty minutes into the flight, they drew their guns and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance.\n\nThe well-dressed Argüello reportedly threw his sole grenade down the airliner aisle, but it failed to explode, and he was hit over the head with a bottle of whiskey by a passenger after he drew his pistol. As the pilot threw the plane into a , throwing the hijackers off balance, Arguello fired his gun 3–5 times, wounding steward Shlomo Vider.\n\nKhaled was also unsuccessful; unable to reach her own grenades concealed within her brassiere, she was beaten by the security and passengers, while the plane made an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport.\n\nAccording to the passengers and sky marshals, Argüello was shot four times during this struggle, and died later of his wounds. Argüello was dead by the time he and Khaled were in the ambulance en route to Hillingdon Hospital, after pilot Uri Bar-Lev refused orders to return to Israel due to his concern for the wounded steward. His hijacking accomplice Khaled, who herself survived after being subdued by the passengers and security personnel, has at various times claimed he was shot after they failed to hijack the plane.\n\nIn 1972, when the Japanese Red Army and PFLP attacked Lod Airport near Tel Aviv, the letter claiming responsibility for what it dubbed \"Operation Dir Yassin\" claimed that the attack had been carried by \"Squad of the Martyr\" Patrick Argüello – who had died two years earlier in the failed hijacking.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a small book publisher in San Francisco named itself the \"Patrick Argüello Press/People's Information Relay.\" It was noted chiefly for publishing a \"Minimanual Of The Urban Guerrilla\" and \"Red Army Faction.\" After its editors were arrested on unrelated charges, the company was dissolved.\n\nIn 1983, after the Nicaraguan revolution, the Sandinistas commemorated Argüello by renaming the geothermal plant at Momotombo in his honor. However, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Nicaraguan government of Arnoldo Alemán removed the name of the plant, claiming it was wrong to honor a terrorist.\n\nThe 1990s musical group \"Baader Meinhof\" wrote a song entitled \"Kill Ramirez,\" which included the verse, \"Patrick Argüello, Leila Khaled/disappeared into the tail end of the plane/said he's not one/of the brothers/good days bad days/they're all the same/Kill Ramirez el pirata.\"\n\nLeila Khaled spoke often of Argüello after the hijacking, stating that \"Our rendezvous with history was approaching: all plans had to be translated into action; history was ours to write; Patrick Argüello was to write it in blood, I was not so honoured.\"\n\nGhassan Kanafani later spoke of Argüello, saying \"The martyr Patrick Argüello is a symbol for a just cause and the struggle to achieve it, a struggle without limits. He is a symbol for the oppressed and deprived masses, represented by Oum Saad and many others coming from the camps and from all parts of Lebanon, who marched in his funeral procession.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2055164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055164", "title": "Radioluminescence", "text": "Radioluminescence\n\nRadioluminescence is the phenomenon by which light is produced in a material by bombardment with ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. Radioluminescence is used as a low level light source for night illumination of instruments or signage. Radioluminescent paint used to be used for clock hands and instrument dials, enabling them to be read in the dark. Radioluminescence is also sometimes seen around high-power radiation sources, such as nuclear reactors and radioisotopes.\n\nRadioluminescence occurs when an incoming particle of ionizing radiation collides with an atom or molecule, exciting an orbital electron to a higher energy level. The particle usually comes from the radioactive decay of an atom of a radioisotope, an isotope of an element which is radioactive. The electron then returns to its ground energy level by emitting the extra energy as a photon of light. A chemical that releases light of a particular color when struck by ionizing radiation is called a phosphor. Radioluminescent light sources usually consist of a radioactive substance mixed with, or in proximity to, a phosphor.\n\nSince radioactivity was discovered around the turn of the 20th century, the main application of radioluminescence has been in radioluminescent paint, used on watch and compass dials, gunsights, aircraft flight instrument faces, and other instruments, to allow them to be seen in the dark. Radioluminescent paint consists of a mixture of a chemical containing a radioisotope with a radioluminescent chemical (phosphor). The continuous radioactive decay of the isotope's atoms releases radiation particles which strike the molecules of the phosphor, causing them to give off light. The constant bombardment by radioactive particles causes the chemical breakdown of many types of phosphor, so radioluminescent paints lose some of their luminosity over their working life.\n\nThe first use of radioluminescence was in luminous paint containing radium, a natural radioisotope. Beginning in 1908, luminous paint containing a mixture of radium and copper-doped zinc sulfide was used to paint watch faces and instrument dials, giving a greenish glow. Phosphors containing copper-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) yield blue-green light; copper and manganese-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Mn), yielding yellow-orange light, are also used. Radium-based luminescent paint is no longer used due to the radiation hazard posed to those manufacturing the dials. These phosphors are not suitable for use in layers thicker than 25 mg/cm, as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium.\n\nZnS:Ag coated spinthariscope screens were used by Ernest Rutherford in his experiments discovering the atomic nucleus.\n\nRadium was used in luminous paint until the 1960s, when it was replaced with the other radioisotopes above due to health concerns. In addition to alpha and beta rays, radium emits penetrating gamma rays, which can pass through the metal and glass of a watch dial, and skin. A typical older radium wristwatch dial has a radioactivity of 3–10 kBq and could expose its wearer to an annual dose of 24 millisieverts if worn continuously. Another health hazard is its decay product, the radioactive gas radon, which constitutes a significant risk even at extremely low concentrations when breathed. Radium's long half-life of 1600 years means that surfaces coated with radium paint, such as watch faces and hands, remain a health hazard long after their useful life is over. There are still millions of luminous radium clock, watch, and compass faces and aircraft instrument dials owned by the public. The case of the \"Radium Girls\", workers in watch factories in the early 1920s who painted watch faces with radium paint and later contracted fatal cancer through ingesting radium when they pointed their brushes with their lips, increased public awareness of the hazards of radioluminescent materials, and radioactivity in general.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, radium was progressively replaced with paint containing promethium-147. Promethium is a low-energy beta-emitter, which, unlike alpha emitters like radium, does not degrade the phosphor lattice, so the luminosity of the material will not degrade so quickly. It also does not emit the penetrating gamma rays which radium does. The half-life of Pm is only 2.62 years, so in a decade the radioactivity of a promethium dial will decline to only 1/16 of its original value, making it safer to dispose of, compared to radium with its half life of 1600 years. However, this short half-life meant that the luminosity of promethium dials also dropped by half every 2.62 years, giving them a short useful life, which led to promethium's replacement by tritium.\n\nPromethium-based paint was used to illuminate Apollo Lunar Module electrical switch tips and painted on control panels of the Lunar Roving Vehicle.\n\nThe latest generation of radioluminescent materials is based on tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with half-life of 12.32 years that emits very low-energy beta radiation. It is used on wristwatch faces, gun sights, and emergency exit signs. The tritium gas is contained in a small glass tube, coated with a phosphor on the inside. Beta particles emitted by the tritium strike the phosphor coating and cause it to fluoresce, emitting light, usually yellow-green.\n\nTritium is used because it is believed to pose a negligible threat to human health, in contrast to the previous radioluminescent source, radium, which proved to be a significant radiological hazard. The low-energy 5.7 keV beta particles emitted by tritium cannot pass through the enclosing glass tube. Even if they could, they are not able to penetrate human skin. Tritium is only a health threat if ingested. Since tritium is a gas, if a tritium tube breaks, the gas dissipates in the air and is diluted to safe concentrations.\nTritium has a half-life of 12.3 years, so the brightness of a tritium light source will decline to half its initial value in that time.\n\n"}

His father Leonardo Barbalinardo changed his name to Leonardo Lombardi shortly after moving to Canada because the Anglo-Saxon community of Toronto at the time had difficulty pronouncing his name. Leonardo had come to Canada from Pisticci, in the region of Basilicata.\n\nHe was lead trumpet player for the Benny Palmer Orchestra in London, a popular Ontario big band during the 1930s. He enlisted in the Canadian Army during World War II in 1942, and was soon stationed in Europe, participating in the taking of Juno Beach. He was a Sergeant in the army, and during the war he entertained the troops with his trumpet.\n\nHe returned to Canada in 1946, and in 1948 he opened a supermarket named \"Lombardi's Italian Foods Ltd.\", or simply \"Lombardi’s Supermarket\", at 637 College Street, an area which came to be known as Little Italy. He began his broadcasting career as a producer for an hour-long Italian music program, first on CHUM and later on CKFH in which he advertised his supermarket. The show was successful and his store flourished. Lombardi became a promoter of concerts and sporting events. A champion of multiculturalism before it was implemented as Canadian government policy, he founded one of the first multilingual radio stations in Canada, CHIN in 1966 and CHIN-FM in 1967, which now serve over 30 ethnic communities. By 1968, CHIN was broadcasting in 32 languages, with Italian language programming predominant, at 60 hours per week.\n\nLombardi later hosted an Italian-language television program on CITY-TV. He was also known for hosting the annual CHIN Picnics at the Canadian National Exhibition, featuring bikini contests derided by many feminists.\n\nHe would later explain the choice of \"CHIN\" using a backronym:\n\nLombardi ran for a seat on Toronto City Council in the 1969 municipal election in Ward 4 which included Toronto's Little Italy but was defeated by less than 200 votes.\n\nLombardi was married to Lena, with whom he had one son, Leonard (also known as Lenny), and two daughters, Donina and Theresa. He was sometimes referred to as \"Mr. Toronto\", and usually wore a baseball cap.\n\nHe died in hospital on 18 March 2002 after a brief illness. A funeral mass was held at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Little Italy on 25 March, and was attended by over a thousand people, including former Premier of Ontario Mike Harris.\n\nThe day after his death, York West representative Judy Sgro paid tribute to him in the House of Commons of Canada. Mel Lastman, then mayor of Toronto, stated that \"Johnny invented multicultural radio in Toronto\". On 20 March, Eglinton—Lawrence Member of Parliament Joe Volpe also paid tribute to Lombardi in the Commons, referring to him as \"king of Little Italy\" and the \"father of multicultural broadcasting\", also stating:\nHe would complete his tribute with a statement spoken in Italian. On 26 March, Lombardi received tributes in the Canadian Senate from Frank Mahovlich and Consiglio Di Nino.\n\nLombardi was a recipient of the Order of Canada and was invited by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1994, in which he had originally participated.\n\nOften referred to as the \"mayor of Little Italy,\" Lombardi lived in the neighborhood all his life, and a memorial to him was installed at the southwest corner of College Street and Grace Street, in an area known as \"Piazza Johnny Lombardi\" in Little Italy. It is a bronze statue of Lombardi, seated on an arced granite bench, with a statue of a seated boy nearby. It was designed by Veronica and Edwin Dam de Nogales.\n\nIn Pisticci, a comune of the Basilicata region in southern Italy, a square was restored and renamed Piazza Johnny Lombardi (also known as Piazza Lombardi) in his honour. It will \"function as the main focal point for all musical shows and exhibits in Pisticci\", a tribute to Lombardi's trumpet playing. A ceremony held on 11 August 2007 in Pisticci, declared Johnny Lombardi Day, officially twinned the Piazza in Pisticci with Piazza Johnny Lombardi in Toronto.\n\nLombardi was also bestowed with the Cavaliere Ufficiale (\"Official Knight of the Italian Republic\"), awarded a Federal Citation of Citizenship, and won Broadcaster of the Year Award. The municipal government of the city of Toronto officially named a segment of College Street between Clinton Street and Grace Street as \"Johnny Lombardi Way\" in his honour. That area houses the CHIN Radio building, and was the location of Lombardi's grocery store.\n\nHis son Lenny and daughter Theresa, and daughter-in-law Grace, along with Joe Pantalone, established The Johnny Lombardi Multicultural Foundation on 21 May 2008.\nThe hour-long documentary, produced by his son Lenny and his wife Grace Fusillo-Lombardi, \"Johnny Lombardi: The Great Communicator\" about his life contains interview clips from many well-known Canadians, including Jean Chrétien and Ted Rogers.\n\nLombardi was one of six original inductees into the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, honouring Italians or descendants of emigrant Italians \"who have demonstrated an exceptional level of accomplishment within their respective fields\". The others were Rudolph Bratty, Phil Esposito, Julian Fantino, Connie Francis and Giancarlo Giannini.\n\nThe \"Ethnic Broadcasting Award in honour of Johnny Lombardi\" at Ryerson University awards $1,000 to a student in the School of Radio and Television Arts program at the university \"who demonstrates a special proficiency in ethnic broadcasting\".\n\nIn \"Portrait of the Street: The Soul and Spirit of College\", a documentary by Sandra Danilovic of the history of College Street and the surrounding area, Lombardi recounts an anecdote from his youth. He had walked for more than an hour to a pool in Mimico with friends, only to be turned away:\n\nLombardi was memorialized in a Heritage Minute, discussing his service at Juno Beach and subsequent impact on Canadian culture.\n\nHis son Lenny and daughter Theresa remain dedicated to continuing the legacy their father left. Lenny is president and CEO of CHIN Radio/TV International. Theresa is the vice president and general manager.\n\n"}

It is currently the only pre-university centre to offer the Commerce stream apart from the traditional arts and science streams offered by pre-university institutions.\n\nOutram Institute was the first centralised institute open in 1987, and the oldest before her annexation into the Millennia Institute. Outram Institute occupied the former premises of the Chung Hwa Girls' High School and led by her first school principal, Mrs Lim Han Soon.\n\nIn 1989, Outram Institute was the first pre-university centre in Singapore to offer the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry examination, on top of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination. The first batch of its students achieved an 80 percent pass rate in the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry examination, as reflected on a local article on 18 October 1989.\n\nJurong Institute was the third centralised institute when it was established in 1989 and was initially located at Jurong West Street 91. The Institute moved to 2 Toh Tuck Terrace on 18 November 1994.\n\nJurong Institute was known for its stringent examination standards, which hit the news in 1990. The uproar involved the institute's policy that all advancing students of the promotional examination are required to re-take all subjects in the supplementary exam, including the ones cleared by the students in the promotional examination.\n\nOn 26 July 2003, decision was made public by the Ministry of Education on the merger of Outram Institute and Jurong Institute to conglomerate the sparsely organised three-year pre-university institutions into a single entity. This move was to allow consolidation of expertise and teaching resources of the two institutes, and provide students with more customised programmes and facilities, thereby enhancing the delivery of the three-year pre-university education programme. As a result, Millennia Institute was established on 3 January 2004. A new campus was announced on 2 December 2003 to be ready in 2007.\n\nOn 12 December 2006, the institution relocated to its permanent campus at 60 Bukit Batok West Avenue 8. The permanent campus was officially declared open in May 2009 by former Minister for Education Dr. Ng Eng Hen as the guest of honour.\n\nIn May 2012, the Millennia Institute chaired the annual pre-University seminar at Nanyang Technological University. Held in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, the event was the first to include a theme song since the inception of the seminar.\n\nMillennia institute accepts its students based on academic merit through the annual joint admission exercise, which allows non-integrated programme students to apply to post-secondary institutions via their Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examination results. The net aggregate L1R4 result, which encompasses the results of a first language and four relevant content-based subjects (of which mathematics and a humanities subject is mandatory), is considered for the admission to Millennia Institute.\n\nMillennia Institute's campus along Bukit Batok West Avenue 8 covers an area of approximately 16 hectares. Constructed at a cost of around S$24 million, the purpose-built campus catering to pre-university education is completed with Junior College equivalent facilities, including two air-conditioned lecture theatres designed to accommodate the entire cohort.\n\nTutorial rooms are built into a single block, streamlined to connect the tutorial rooms conveniently to the lecture rooms, canteen and the laboratories. Other facilities include an auditorium, a fully air conditioned multi-purpose hall and a sports complex with running track, AstroTurf hockey pitch, as well as 2 tennis, 2 basketball, badminton and volleyball courts.\n\nThe library, stylised as \"MIndSpace\", is located at the heart of the campus. The MIndSpace feature five discussion rooms located at the upper level for small-group study, discussions or project work, as well as two instructional rooms that can accommodate 36 students each for teaching and learning.\n\nThe three-years course offered at Millennia Institute leads to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination. As opposed to two year courses offered at junior colleges, students at the Millennia Institute have an additional year to prepare for the national examinations, with Project Work and H1 level Mother Tongue Languages examined in the second year. Millennia Institute is the only public pre-university centre in Singapore to offer Commerce for the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination, with Management of Business and Principles of Accounts offered the two Commerce stream academic subjects.\n\n\n"}

Bicycle clubs, such as the Leagues of American Wheelmen, led the effort to \"reform\" roads nationwide. In Michigan, the first state highway commissioner, Horatio \"Good Roads\" Earle (1855-1935), a bicyclist himself, vowed to conquer \"the Mighty Monarch Mud.\" A former state senator, Earle served as state highway commissioner until 1909.

{"id": "2055202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055202", "title": "Trimpin", "text": "Trimpin\n\nTrimpin (born Gerhard Trimpin) (b. 1951) is a German born kinetic sculptor, sound artist, and musician currently living in Seattle, Washington, United States.\n\nTrimpin's work integrates sculpture and sound across a variety of media including fixed installation and live music, theater, and dance performance. His works are known to be electromechanically actuated by embedded microcontrollers that communicate digitally through MIDI.\n\nTrimpin grew up in Istein, now part of Efringen-Kirchen, near the French and Swiss borders. He is a native speaker of Alemannisch and the son of a brass and woodwind player. As a child he had access to old brass instruments to experiment with. He played brass instruments himself, but developed an allergy to metal that affected his lips and made him give up playing. Trimpin's father treated him to spatial musical experiences, playing at some distance in the German woods, and young Trimpin experimented with old radios and with cutting apart and recombining elements of musical instruments. He studied at the University of Berlin.\n\nOne early project in Berlin used a balancing clown figurine to play a wire recording of speech. The wire was stretched across a room and tilted up and down while the figurine rode the wire and played it, backwards and forwards. The history of his work recapitulates much of the history of data and sound storage technology. Prior to the availability of MIDI, Trimpin developed his own protocol for computer storage of music.\n\nIn 1980 Trimpin moved to America because he needed access to old, used technological components, which were difficult to find in Europe; he settled in Seattle because it \"sounded like a nice place to live\". In the 1980s, he worked one month per year fishing in Alaska to support his work.\n\nOne of his early installations was a six-story-high microtonal xylophone (that is, one with smaller intervals between achievable tones than in conventional Western musical scales) running through a spiral staircase in an Amsterdam theater, with computer-driven melodies ripping up and down it. Another piece was a water fountain installation in which drops of water, timed in complex rhythmic fugues, dripped into glass receptacles. Several of his pieces since that time have made similar use of falling water. A dance piece used the dancers' bodies to make music, with small bellows in the dancers' shoes that played duck calls, air blowers triggered by sacs under their armpits, etc.\n\nTrimpin has invented a gamelan whose iron bells are suspended in air by electronic magnets; a photo sensor prevents them from rising past a certain point, and since they don't touch anything, once rung they will sound with a phenomenally long decay. Another invention is an extra-long bass clarinet. Extra keys spiraled around the instrument allow a microtonal scale. A human blows through the mouthpiece; the dozens of extra keys are played via computer. In 1987 he met Conlon Nancarrow, composer of experimental player piano music unplayable by a human pianist. Trimpin already had the technology to convert Nancarrow's player piano rolls into MIDI information, thus saving their contents from potential deterioration and disaster.\n\nTrimpin has invented machines to play every instrument of the orchestra via MIDI commands. His mechanical cello can achieve virtually unnoticeable bow changes, and his MIDI timpani can be rubbed quickly by the mallet, for a timpani drone unachievable by human hands. Indeed, his pieces do not generally try to imitate human playing. \"What I'm trying to do,\" he has remarked, \"is go beyond human physical limitations to play instruments in such a way that no matter how complex the composition of the timing, it can be pushed over the limits.\"\n\nAlthough most of his music is composed digitally, Trimpin almost never uses electronic sounds — not because he objects to them on principle — but because he asserts that loudspeaker design, mostly unchanged for 100 years, has lagged behind the rest of electronic music technology. An outlier to the method audiences normally experience his work, the tornado-shaped column of self-tuning guitars called \"IF VI WAS IX: Roots and Branches\", installed in Seattle's Experience Music Project, uses electric guitars and an array of headphones due to the constraints of the space and neighboring exhibitions.\n\nBeginning in July 2005, several Washington museums engaged in a year-long survey of his work curated by Beth Sellars, with installations and/or performances occurring at the Seattle Art Museum at SAAM, Henry Art Gallery of the University of Washington, Consolidated Works (which dissolved shortly after the Trimpin Exhibit), the Frye Art Museum, Jack Straw New Media Gallery, and Suyama Space in Seattle; the Museum of Glass and the Tacoma Art Museum in Tacoma; the Washington State University Museum of Art (Pullman); and, outside of Washington State, at the Missoula Museum of Art in Missoula, Montana and the Vancouver International Jazz Festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nThe Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Concourse A artwalk includes Trimpin's \"Contraption\" installed next to the concourse's first moving sidewalk. \"Contraption\" is a motion activated work consisting of two moving \"contraptions\" made of assorted musical instruments and found objects, housed in an glass case. Each \"contraption\" plays music in response to people passing by.\n\nTrimpin is a recipient of numerous honors. Trimpin received a 1994 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. Trimpin was also the recipient of a 1997 MacArthur \"Genius\" Award. More recently, he was an invited keynote speaker at the 7th International NIME (New Interfaces for Musical Expression) conference in New York City, in June 2007. In May 2010, he was the honorary recipient of a Doctor of Musical Arts from California Institute of the Arts.\n\nAs of 2007, he is among a number of artists establishing studio space in Tieton, Washington, on the edge of Washington's Yakima Valley.\n\nTrimpin's water-based sound sculpture \"Sheng High\" was exhibited during the 2009 Ojai Music Festival, and one of his creations was featured in one of the pieces performed on the last evening. He was subsequently commissioned to create a permanent sound sculpture (called the Sound Arch) for the music amphitheatre at Ojai. \n\nTrimpin's sculpture, Klompen, is a sound sculpture that includes 96 Dutch wooden clogs that connect to a computer by wires suspended from the ceiling. Placing a quarter in a token box electronically triggers mallets in the toes of the shoes. Klompen plays 20 different compositions. It is part of the permanent collection at Utah State University's Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art.\n\nThe permanent installation Seismofon is on display at the Science Museum of Minnesota. This giant chime instrument transforms worldwide earthquake data from the USGS into various tempos and volumes, which are played through the Seismofon's suspended bells.\n\nIn 2010, Trimpin transformed into robotic form a set of percussion instruments that David A. Jaffe inherited from Henry Brant for use in Jaffe's composition \"The Space Between Us\". The performance (at the 2011 Other Minds Festival) included an installation with 18 robotic tubular bells hung above the audience, two robotic xylophones, a robotic glockenspiel and a disklavier, all controlled by a percussionist using a 3-D sensor (radiodrum), augmented by two live string quartets surrounding the audience.\n\nSince Fall 2010, Trimpin has been working with students and faculty at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) to create the multimedia installation \"The Gurs Zyklus.\" Composer/director/performer Rinde Eckert will collaborate with Trimpin on the project.\n\nFrom March 16 until April 28, 2012, Trimpin's installation \"Trimpin:(CanonX+4:33=100) \" was open to the public at Open Space in Victoria, BC, Canada. The installation featured five deconstructed pianos with various mechanical actuators configured to play compositions written by Trimpin. The audience was able to activate a composition by manoeuvering an arcade style game joystick which in turn moved an RGB colour sensor suspended on the wall. The sensor was positioned in front of an array of primary colour silk screened posters, also made by Trimpin. After a position was selected, the listener could push a button located next to the joystick, the sensor would scan the colour and utilize the information in a composition choosing algorithm. Almost immediately after the button was pressed a composition would begin. On the final day of the installation, the group MISTIC held a concert with compositions created specifically for the installation. By removing the control computer for the installation, and implementing their own, each member was able to perform live.\n\nA feature documentary film about the artist/inventor/composer's life and work, \"TRIMPIN: The Sound of Invention\", produced and directed by Peter Esmonde, premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, in March 2009. The documentary subsequently screened at film festivals in New York, London, Toronto, Barcelona, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Vancouver, Dublin, Goteborg, Oslo, and New Zealand. DVD release is slated for Fall 2010.\n\nIn May 2011 a biographical book entitled \"TRIMPIN / Contraptions for Art and Sound\" was published by Marquand Books. The book was compiled and edited by Anne Focke with contributions from many of Trimpin's friends and collaborators including Kyle Gann, Charles Amirkhanian and David Harrington of Kronos Quartet. The book was funded by the private sale of a limited edition run of thirteen works titled \"BookBeatBox\". Each unique sculpture is both a hand-made brushed aluminum encasement for the book, and also a musical instrument powered by a hand-crank.\n\n"}

It is located in the Grapevine Canyon (\"La Cañada de las Uvas\") between the San Emigdio Mountains and Tehachapi Mountains. It is in the area of Tejon Pass along Interstate 5 in Kern County, California, the main route through the mountain ranges separating the Central Valley from the Los Angeles Basin and Southern California. The fort's location protected the San Joaquin Valley from the south and west.\n\nThe fort's mission was to suppress stock rustling and protect settlers from attacks by discontent Californios (pre-statehood residents), and Native American tribes, including the Paiute and Mojave, and to monitor the less aggressive Emigdiano living nearby. The Emigdiano, who were closely related to the Chumash of the coastal and interior lands to the west, had several villages near Fort Tejon. After the earlier Spanish and Mexican colonial Indian Reductions, they were generally cooperative with the European-American settlers and the U.S. Army.\n\nAt the urging of Edward Fitzgerald Beale, Superintendent of Indian Affairs in California, the U.S. Army established Fort Tejon in 1854. Fort Tejon was the headquarters of the First U.S. Dragoons until those Regular Army troops were transferred to the East in July 1861 soon after the outbreak of the American Civil War. The fort was re-occupied by California volunteer troops in 1863. Those units included Companies D, E and G of the 2nd California Volunteer Cavalry from July 6 to August 17, 1863; and Company B of the 2nd California Volunteer Infantry, which remained there until Fort Tejon was abandoned for good on September 11, 1864.\n\nThe fort lay along the Stockton - Los Angeles Road. From 1858, it was a stagecoach station on the Butterfield Overland Mail, which followed the same route as far as Visalia. From 1858, Fort Tejon was the western terminus of the experimental U.S. Camel Corps, which used imported camels in an effort to carry supplies across arid regions in the Southwest. The soldiers found the camels hardy, but temperamental, and they spooked the horses used by the cavalry.\n\nThe great earthquake of 1857, which became known as the Fort Tejon earthquake, was centered nearly 100 miles away. The earthquake became associated with the fort by name because the area near the epicenter was sparsely populated. The most reliable report of the event was issued from the fort, nearly distant.\n\nThe state historic park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its original historic buildings have been documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey. Several buildings have been restored, and two are partially open to visitors. The restored barracks contain display cases of uniforms and a recreated troopers' quarters. The commanding officer's quarters have several restored and furnished rooms. Officers' quarters nearby are only stabilized in a state of arrested decay, with walls buttressed by masonry and lumber and tied together with reinforcing rods.\n\nA quartermaster building has recently been reconstructed and houses materials used in Dragoon life and Civil War reenactments. The sites of former buildings, planned for reconstruction, are marked by split rail fences along the outlines of their foundations. A park office, containing exhibits of dragoon life and restrooms, is at the east end of the parade ground near the parking lot by Interstate 5.\n\nThe park grounds include the original barracks, where the soldiers slept, and also the grave site of Peter Lebeck, which is indicated with a historical marker. The nearby town of Lebec is named after him.\n\nFort Tejon is the site of frequent Civil War reenactments presented by the Fort Tejon Historical Association.\n\nThe Fort Tejon earthquake occurred at about 8:20 AM (Pacific time) on January 9, 1857. It ruptured the San Andreas Fault for a length of about , between Parkfield and San Bernardino. Displacement along the fault was as much as 9 meters (30 feet) in the Carrizo Plain but less along the Palmdale section of the fault, closest to Los Angeles. The amount of fault slip gives this earthquake a moment magnitude of 7.9, comparable to that of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Based on the (uncertain) distribution of foreshocks for this earthquake, it is assumed that the beginning of the fault rupture (the epicenter) was in the area between Parkfield and Cholame, about 60 miles northwest. Nevertheless, it is usually called the \"Fort Tejon\" earthquake because this was the location of the greatest damage, most of the area being unpopulated at the time.\n\n\n"}

Historically part of Huntingdonshire, it is located near the town of Huntingdon, and not far west of Wyton. It lies on the A141 road and on the north bank of the River Great Ouse, upon which it has a significant marina. The village is not to be confused with the much larger town of Hertford, some to the south-east.\n\nIt is sometimes known as Hartford-cum-Sapley, and in the past has been known as Hereford by Huntingdon, Herford, Hertford and Harford.\n\nAll Saints' Church in Hartford is an Anglican church built in 1180 just on the north riverbank. The church has six bells.\nDespite the rival claim of Hertford, there is a good case for identifying Hartford as the venue of the English synod of 673.\n\nIn 1085 William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in 1086 and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in 1066 and in 1086, together with the taxable value.\n\nHartford was listed in the Domesday Book in the Hundred of Hurstingstone in Huntingdonshire; the name of the settlement was written as \"Hereforde\" in the Domesday Book. In 1086 there was just one manor at Hartford; the annual rent paid to the lord of the manor in 1066 had been £24 and the rent had fallen to £15 in 1086.\n\nThe Domesday Book does not explicitly detail the population of a place but it records that there were 34 households at Hartford. There is no consensus about the average size of a household at that time; estimates range from 3.5 to 5.0 people per household. Using these figures then an estimate of the population of Hartford in 1086 is that it was within the range of 119 and 170 people.\n\nThe Domesday Book uses a number of units of measure for areas of land that are now unfamiliar terms, such as hides and ploughlands. In different parts of the country, these were terms for the area of land that a team of eight oxen could plough in a single season and are equivalent to ; this was the amount of land that was considered to be sufficient to support a single family. By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of land that could be assessed as £1 for tax purposes. The survey records that there were twelve ploughlands at Hartford in 1086 and that there was the capacity for a further five ploughlands. In addition to the arable land, there was of meadows, of woodland and two water mills at Hartford.\n\nThe tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. It was originally a way of collecting a tribute to pay off the Danes when they attacked England, and was only levied when necessary. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manor at Hartford the total tax assessed was 15 geld.\n\nBy 1086 there were two churches and a priest at Hartford.\n\nIn the period 1801 to 1901 the population of Hartford was recorded every ten years by the UK census. During this time the population was in the range of 283 (the lowest was in 1811) and 452 (the highest was in 1831).\n\nFrom 1901, a census was taken every ten years with the exception of 1941 (due to the Second World War).\n\n"}

There are three main types of institutional isomorphism: normative, coercive and mimetic. The development that these three types of isomorphism promote can also create isomorphic paradoxes that hinder such development. Specifically, these isomorphic paradoxes are related to an organization's remit, resources, accountability, and professionalization.\n\nThe concept of institutional isomorphism was primarily developed by Paul DiMaggio and Walter Powell.\nThe concept appears in their classical paper \"\" from 1983.\n\nIsomorphism in the context of globalization, is an idea of contemporary national societies that is addressed by the institutionalization of world models constructed and propagated through global cultural and associational processes. As it is emphasized by realist theories the heterogeneity of economic and political resource or local cultural origins by the micro-phenomenological theories, many ideas suggest that the trajectory of change in political units is towards homogenization around the world. \n\nSuch similarities so called isomorphic changes are found by researchers, explaining, despite of all possible configurations of local economic forces, power relationships, and forms of traditional culture it might consist of, a previously-isolated island society that made contact with the rest of the globe would quickly take on standardized forms and appear to be similar to a hundred other nation-states around the world.

The stretching and compression uses devices that ensure that the different color components of the pulse travel different distances.\n\nCPA for lasers was introduced by Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou at the University of Rochester in the mid-1980s, work for which they received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018. \n\nCPA is the current state-of-the-art technique used by most of the highest-power lasers in the world.\n\nBefore the introduction of CPA in the mid-1980s, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because a laser pulse at intensities of gigawatts per square centimeter causes serious damage to the gain medium through nonlinear processes such as self-focusing. For example, some of the most powerful compressed CPA laser beams, even in an unfocused large aperture (after exiting the compression grating) can exceed intensities of 700 GW/cm, which if allowed to propagate in air or the laser gain medium would instantly self-focus and form a plasma or cause filament propagation, both of which would ruin the original beam's desirable qualities and could even cause back-reflection potentially damaging the laser's components. In order to keep the intensity of laser pulses below the threshold of the nonlinear effects, the laser systems had to be large and expensive, and the peak power of laser pulses was limited to the high gigawatt level or terawatt level for very large multi-beam facilities.\n\nIn CPA, on the other hand, an ultrashort laser pulse is stretched out in time prior to introducing it to the gain medium using a pair of gratings that are arranged so that the low-frequency component of the laser pulse travels a shorter path than the high-frequency component does. After going through the grating pair, the laser pulse becomes positively chirped, that is, the high-frequency component lags behind the low-frequency component, and has longer pulse duration than the original by a factor of 1000 to .\n\nThen the stretched pulse, whose intensity is sufficiently low compared with the intensity limit of gigawatts per square centimeter, is safely introduced to the gain medium and amplified by a factor of a million or more. Finally, the amplified laser pulse is recompressed back to the original pulse width through reversal of the process of stretching, achieving orders-of-magnitude higher peak power than laser systems could generate before the invention of CPA.\n\nIn addition to the higher peak power, CPA makes it possible to miniaturize laser systems (the compressor being the biggest part). A compact high-power laser, known as a tabletop terawatt laser (T laser, typically delivering of energy within ), can be created based on the CPA technique.\n\nThere are several ways to construct compressors and stretchers. However, a typical Ti:sapphire-based chirped-pulse amplifier requires that the pulses are stretched to several hundred picoseconds, which means that the different wavelength components must experience about 10 cm difference in path length. The most practical way to achieve this is with grating-based stretchers and compressors. Stretchers and compressors are characterized by their dispersion. With \"negative dispersion\", light with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) takes less time to travel through the device than light with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). With \"positive dispersion\", it is the other way around. In a CPA, the dispersions of the stretcher and compressor must cancel out. Because of practical considerations, the (high-power) compressor is usually designed with negative dispersion, and the (low-power) stretcher is therefore designed with positive dispersion.\n\nIn principle, the dispersion of an optical device is a function formula_1, where formula_2 is the time delay experienced by a frequency component formula_3. (Sometimes the phase formula_4 is used, where is the speed of light and formula_5 is the wavelength.) Each component in the whole chain from the seed laser to the output of the compressor contributes to the dispersion. It turns out to be hard to tune the dispersions of the stretcher and compressor such that the resulting pulses are shorter than about 100 femtoseconds. For this, additional dispersive elements may be needed.\n\nFigure 1 shows the simplest grating configuration, where long-wavelength components travel a larger distance than the short-wavelength components (negative dispersion). Often, only a single grating is used, with extra mirrors such that the beam hits the grating four times rather than two times as shown in the picture.\nThis setup is normally used as a compressor, since it does not involve transmissive components that could lead to unwanted side-effects when dealing with high-intensity pulses. The dispersion can be tuned easily by changing the distance between the two gratings.\n\nFigure 2 shows a more complicated grating configuration that involves focusing elements, here depicted as lenses. The lenses are placed at a distance formula_6 from each other (they act as a 1:1 telescope), and at a distance formula_7 from the gratings. If formula_8, the setup acts as a \"positive-dispersion\" stretcher and if formula_9, it is a \"negative-dispersion\" stretcher. The formula_10 case is used in Femtosecond pulse shaping. Usually, the focusing element is a spherical or cylindrical mirror rather than a lens. As with the configuration in Figure 1, it is possible to use an additional mirror and use a single grating rather than two separate ones. This setup requires that the beam diameter is very small compared to the length of the telescope; otherwise undesirable aberrations will be introduced. For this reason, it is normally used as a stretcher before the amplification stage, since the low-intensity seed pulses can be collimated to a beam with a small diameter.\n\nIt is possible to use prisms rather than gratings as a dispersive elements, as in Figure 3. Despite such a simple change the set-up behaves quite differently, as to first order no group delay dispersion is introduced. Such a stretcher/compressor can have both a positive or negative dispersion, depending on the geometry and the material properties of the prisms. With lenses, the sign of the dispersion can be reversed, similar to Figure 2. For a given distance between the dispersive elements, prisms generate much less dispersion than gratings. Prisms and gratings are sometimes combined to correct higher order dispersion (\"grisms\"), in which case the distance between the prisms is on the order of 10 meters rather than 50 cm as with a grating compressor. Gratings lose power into the other orders while prisms lose power due to Rayleigh scattering.\n\nChirped pulses from formula_11 laser amplifiers may be phase locked via reflection from a phase-conjugating mirror \nto increase the brightness as formula_12. For this purpose degenerate four-wave mixing Kerr Phase conjugation is relevant\n\nSome other techniques can be used for stretching and compressing pulses, but these are not suitable as the main stretcher/compressor in CPA due to their limited amount of dispersion and due to their inability to handle high-intensity pulses.\n\n\nCPA is used in all of the highest-power lasers (greater than about 100 terawatts) in the world, with the exception of the ≈500 TW National Ignition Facility. Some examples of these lasers are the Vulcan laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's Central Laser Facility, the Diocles laser at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the GEKKO XII laser at the GEKKO XII facility in the Institute for Laser Engineering at Osaka University, the OMEGA EP laser at the University of Rochester's Lab for Laser Energetics and the now dismantled petawatt line on the former Nova laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Gérard Mourou has proposed using Chirped pulse amplification to generate high-energy and low-duration laser pulses to transmute highly radioactive material (contained in a target) to significantly reduce its half-life, from thousands of years to only a few minutes.\n\nApart from these state-of-the-art research systems, a number of commercial manufacturers sell Ti:sapphire-based CPAs with peak powers of 10 to 100 gigawatts.\n\n"}

It has trucks with traction motors but, unlike a B unit, it cannot generate power on its own since it lacks a prime mover. Instead, the slug is connected to a powered locomotive, called the mother, which provides the needed electrical power to operate the traction motors, and the motor controls.\n\nA slug is used to increase adhesive weight, allowing full power to be applied at a lower speed, thus allowing a higher maximum tractive effort. They are often used in low-speed operations such as switching operations in yards. At low speeds, a diesel-electric locomotive prime mover is capable of producing more electricity than its traction motors can use effectively. Extra power would cause the wheels to slip and possibly overheat the traction motors. A slug increases the number of traction motors available to the locomotive, increasing both the pulling and braking power. In addition the load on each traction motor is reduced, which helps prevent overheating from excess current. Slugs typically carry ballast to increase their weight and improve traction. Large blocks of concrete are frequently used for this purpose, substituting for the weight of the now-absent prime mover.\n\nSlugs can be built new or converted from existing locomotives. Conversion has enjoyed popularity as a way to reuse otherwise obsolete locomotives, especially those with worn-out diesel prime movers but having good traction motors.\n\nThere are several types of slug, distinguished by intended use. This division is not absolute, and characteristics of one type may appear on another.\n\nA yard slug is designed for switching, and therefore is built to increase visibility in low-speed operation. It has a low body and no cab, allowing the engineer or driver in the powered unit to see past it. Mother-slug sets are used in heavy switching, hump yard switching, and transfer runs between yards. Some are radio controlled without an engineer in the cab.\n\nA hump slug is designed for even slower operation than a yard slug. They are often six-axle slugs and are often paired with lower-powered six-axle locomotives. They are designed for the specialized purpose of pushing a long cut of cars over a hump at , while yard slugs would normally operate at up to .\n\nRoad slugs are intended to serve as part of a regular locomotive consist for road haulage, and as a result have certain adaptations to suit them for this service. They usually retain dynamic brakes, a feature useless at the low speeds encountered in switching service, and they may be equipped to serve as fuel tenders for the attached \"mother\" locomotives.\n\nIn operation, they are used to provide extra traction at low speeds. As speed increases they are disconnected from the power circuit and function as a control cab if they are in the lead, or simply as an unpowered car in the consist. In braking they augment the powered locomotives, both during dynamic and air brake application.\n\nRoad slugs may take several forms. A group of GP30 and GP35 locomotives were converted by CSX and operated as half of mother-slug pairs. Externally they retain the general appearance of powered diesel-electric locomotives, though they can be identified by the lack of radiators and the removal of most of the access doors on the side of the body. They retain the cab and its controls, and therefore multiple unit control allows them to function as the lead in a string of units. The TEBU units created on the Southern Pacific Railroad from General Electric U25Bs, on the other hand, were cabless; this potential operational deficiency was compensated for by putting them as the center unit of a set of three.\n\nWhen at one end of a set, train crews will often go to great lengths to arrange for the slug to be the leading unit, as the lack of a diesel prime mover provides them with a quiet and vibration-free ride.\n\nMATEs appear similar to slugs, but their design is different. Instead of siphoning-off power as a slug does, the axles in a MATE are fully connected into the transition series in the locomotive it is connected to. A double-ended MATE (a MATE with connections on both ends) turns two four-axle locomotives into the equivalent of two fully fledged six-axle locomotives. A single-ended MATE turns a four-axle locomotive into the equivalent of an eight-axle locomotive. MATEs do not cut out at speed as the motors are fully included in the series–parallel transition stages. SCL's GE U36B fleet is the prime example: they were delivered new with special electrical cabinets to handle the 2 to 4 extra motors in a MATE. With a double-ended MATE, two U36Bs were equivalent to two U36Cs in every way.\n\nSome railroads emulated this concept by using two GP40s, then swapping in six-axle Dash 2 electrical cabinets, and then connecting the GP40s to a double-ended slug rebuilt from an old locomotive. The result is the equivalent of two SD40-2s.\n\nSlugs are known by other names as well. Some are:\n\nThe CCRCLs (Control Car Remote Control Locomotives) used by Union Pacific are sometimes called slugs. This designation is incorrect as the CCRCLs do not have traction motors.\n\nA snail, often confused with a slug, is a cabless locomotive with a prime mover. However, instead of getting electricity from a separate unit, snails have no traction motors and therefore are incapable of operating under their own power. Like slugs, snails are rebuilt from damaged or worn out locomotives and retain the frame and bogies from the original unit. Snails are used for powering engineless units and have no cab or means to control themselves manually, except from a separate unit. SP rebuilt 9 F7Bs into snails for their rotary snowplows. Some of these are still in use today with Union Pacific, along with their snowplow parent units, fighting snow on Donner Pass.\n\n\n"}

After the war, subject to economic sanctions authorised by United Nations resolutions, continued importing of the \"Swiss\" notes was prohibited, and the Central Bank of Iraq began domestic printing of a new Iraqi dinar.\n\nThe second possible explanation is that prior to the Gulf War, Iraq was historically a low inflation country, similar to Switzerland.\n\nAfter the Gulf War, the Iraqi government disendorsed the old currency, favoring newly printed \"Saddam dinars\", and the \"Swiss dinar\" ceased to be legal tender. However, the old currency still circulated in the politically isolated Kurdish regions of Iraq. The government of the Kurdish region did not have the printing plates of the \"Swiss dinar\", but it also refused to accept lower-quality \"Saddam dinar\" banknotes (which were issued in huge amounts). Since the supply of \"Saddam dinar\" banknotes increased while the supply of \"Swiss dinar\" banknotes remained stagnant (even decreased because of notes taken out of circulation), the \"Swiss dinar\" appreciated against the \"Saddam dinar\" note. By having its own stable currency, the northern part of Iraq effectively evaded inflation, which ran rampant throughout the rest of the nation.\n\nFollowing the 2003 invasion the Coalition Provisional Authority, installed by the Coalition Forces, determined that Iraq needed a new, unified currency, but establishing a proper exchange rate was relatively difficult. The market exchange rate for \"Saddam dinars\" to \"Swiss dinars\" remained around 100:1 from 1998 to January 2002, but as the invasion ensued, the Kurdish currency appreciated to 300:1, and subsequently fell to 250:1. After further investigation, the Coalition Provisional Authority determined that it would be best to equate the two currencies by Purchasing Power Parity, which was around 100:1. After researching further, the Coalition decided to adopt an official rate between the market rate and the PPP rate, officially pegging the currency at 150 \"Saddam dinars\" per \"Swiss dinar\".\n\nThere were two proposed methods to unify the currencies. The first would be to print a new set of \"Swiss dinar\" notes and distribute them among the south. However, this would result in 80% of the population needing to exchange the \"Saddam dinar\" notes for \"Swiss dinars\". Since printing more \"Saddam dinar\" notes was not politically favored, after consulting with a currency expert, the Coalition decided to alter the \"Swiss dinar\" plates to the \"Saddam dinar\" denominations. This would allow the least amount of currency exchange, but also take Saddam's image off the currency. The new Swiss currency was created in a different color to differentiate from the old currency.\n\nReportedly, the exchange was relatively swift and without incident, with the exception of two failed attacks on currency convoys.\n\n"}

Bako is an example of a baseball \"journeyman\", having played for 11 different major league teams during his 12-year career. He is officially listed at and .\n\nBako attended high school and college in his home state of Louisiana, winning two conference championships at the University of Southwest Louisiana. After reaching the majors with the American League's Detroit Tigers in 1998, Bako spent seven seasons in the National League, playing with six different teams. He returned to the American League with the Baltimore Orioles and the Kansas City Royals, then played for the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies for one season each.\n\nIn 1990, Bako was drafted out of Lafayette High School—who later retired his number 6—with the ninth pick of the sixth round by the Cleveland Indians. He chose not to sign, and attended the University of Southwest Louisiana. In his college career, Bako caught for the Ragin' Cajuns during two consecutive conference championship seasons: 1991 in the American South Conference, when they finished with a 49–20 record, 14th-best among Division I squads; and 1992 in the Sun Belt Conference, when Southwestern Louisiana's pitching staff amassed a 3.50 earned run average, 29th-best in Division I. After the 1992 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 1993, he was named to the second team of the all-Sun Belt Conference baseball team, and was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the fifth round of the 1993 June draft.\n\nBako began his professional career with the Pioneer Baseball League's Billings Mustangs, a rookie-league farm team of the Reds located in Montana. During the 1993 season, Bako amassed a .314 batting average, second-highest on the team that season behind Chris Sexton. Bako walked 22 times, stole 5 bases, and batted in 30 runs, while excelling defensively compared to the other catcher on the team. His fielding percentage was .988, and he posted only four errors that season. He was also named a Pioneer League All-Star.\n\nBako moved on to the high-A Winston-Salem Spirits in the Carolina League for the 1994 and 1995 seasons. He struggled during the 1994 season, batting only .204 with three home runs and 26 runs batted in (RBIs). 1995 was more successful, with an 81-point boost in batting average (.285), seven home runs and 11 doubles. After the season, Baseball America rated him the top-ranked catching prospect in the Reds farm system.\n\nBako's 1995 performance earned him a promotion to the Southern League's Chattanooga Lookouts, the Reds AA-level affiliate, for 1996, where he was named a Southern League All-Star. He was second on the team in strikeouts (93) and fifth among regulars with a .294 batting average. He hit a career-high eight home runs during that season, adding 27 doubles and 48 RBIs in 360 at bats. In 1997, playing for the Indianapolis Indians, Bako was a teammate of brothers Aaron and Bret Boone. That year, he batted .243 and matched his previous year's career-high home run total. He had 78 hits in 321 at-bats. Bako's game management earned him a reputation, even in the minor leagues. Brett Tomko, who played with Bako in the minors in 1996 as a member of the Lookouts and in 1997 with Indianapolis, recalled one of their mound conversations:\n\n\"Bako:\" Are you really trying out here?<br>\n\"Tomko:\" What do you mean?<br>\n\"Bako:\" Because your stuff is horrible today and if you don't try a little harder, you're not going to make it out of this inning.\nOn November 11, 1997, Bako was traded by the Reds to the Detroit Tigers in an offseason deal that included Donne Wall. After playing 13 games with the Tigers AAA-level affiliate—the Toledo Mud Hens—in 1998, Bako was called up to the Major League club.\n\nBako made his major league debut with the Tigers on April 30, 1998, going 0-for-4 with three strikeouts. His first Major League hit, a bases loaded double, came the next day off Bill Swift, when he went 2-for-5 against the Seattle Mariners in a 17–3 Tigers win. He hit his first major league home run on May 15 against the Oakland Athletics; it came off Mike Mohler in the bottom of the sixth inning with two runners (Damion Easley, Joe Randa) on base. He also went 4-for-4 against the New York Yankees on July 21. Bako's rookie season was arguably his most successful: he posted a .272 batting average, hit three home runs, batted in 30 runs, and collected 106 total bases. After the season, the Tigers traded Bako to the Houston Astros in a seven-player deal that included Brad Ausmus.\n\nBecause of his last name, Bako gained temporary distinction as one of the Astros' \"Killer B's\", which included first baseman Jeff Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio, two formidable veteran players who helped established the Astros as perennial playoff contenders in the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, journalist Dayn Perry jocosely noted the 1999 Astros, \"in pursuit of arcane history, used eight players whose last names began with 'B.'\" The eight included Bagwell, Bako, Glen Barker, Derek Bell, Sean Bergman, Lance Berkman, Biggio, and Tim Bogar.\n\nBako appeared in 73 games for the 1999 Astros; he got at least one hit in his first six games with Houston after beginning the season in the minor leagues, highlighted by a 3-for-4 performance on April 30, the anniversary of his debut. He added another 4-for-4 game to his résumé on July 29 against the Colorado Rockies. Bako hit .256 with two home runs, 17 RBIs, and 16 runs scored in the 1999 season; he was part of Houston's roster for the 1999 National League Division Series, but did not play. After one game for the Astros in 2000, Houston traded Bako to the Florida Marlins. He played his first game for Florida on April 13, going 0-for-4 with a strikeout. Bako played for the Marlins until July 20, batting .242 with 14 RBIs. He was waived on July 21 and claimed by the Atlanta Braves, one of the Marlins' division rivals. He batted .190 with the Braves and played in his first career game at first base in the last two months of the 2000 season.\n\nBako remained with the Braves for the 2001 season, where he was the backup to Javy López. He batted .212, amassing the third-highest (20) walk total among Atlanta's bench players and batting in 15 runs. His top performances of the season were a 3-for-4 game against the Montréal Expos in August and a 2-for-3 night—with 2 walks—in October against Florida. Bako appeared in three games during the 2001 National League Division Series (NLDS), his first playoff appearances, and three more during the National League Championship Series (NLCS). In Game 3 of the NLDS, Bako went 2-for-2 with a two-run home run in the second inning; he also batted in a third run on a squeeze bunt in the fourth.\n\nIn a trade of catchers, the Braves acquired Henry Blanco from the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Bako and José Cabrera. Bako played in 87 games for the Brewers in 2002, his most extensive playing time since his rookie season; behind him, the team used four additional catchers. Bako batted .235 with four home runs for the season. His top performance of the year was against the Minnesota Twins in interleague play; Bako went 3-for-5 with a two-run home run in the top of the fourth inning and a bases-loaded single to drive in a third run.\n\nAfter the 2002 season, Milwaukee traded Bako to the Chicago Cubs, where he spent two complete seasons; 2003 and 2004 were the only consecutive seasons that Bako spent with the same organization. Over his two years, he backed up Damian Miller and Michael Barrett, and was reunited with former Braves teammate Greg Maddux in 2004. In his first Chicago season, Bako batted .229 with 22 walks and 13 doubles; a 4-for-5 performance in his second game of the year was his best of the season. In that game, he batted three times against the Reds with the bases loaded, notching a triple, two singles and six RBIs. Bako batted only .203 for the Cubs in 2004. He hit one home run and eight doubles, displaying his defense with a .989 fielding percentage. His top performance that year was in the second game of a doubleheader against Florida, when he went 3-for-3 and batted in two runs.\n\nAs a free agent, Bako signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2005 season. He batted .250 for the Dodgers in 13 games with two doubles and four RBIs. He backed up both Jason Phillips and Dioner Navarro in 2005, but underwent season-ending surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament in June of that season. The Dodgers granted Bako free agency after the season, and he signed with the Kansas City Royals in December 2005. After beginning the 2006 season in the minor leagues, Bako returned to the majors with the Royals, where he batted .209 backing up John Buck. He played in 60 games with the Baltimore Orioles in 2007, amassing five extra-base hits and batting .205. He tied for the highest total of walks off the Orioles bench and batted in eight runs for the season.\n\nOn February 1, 2008, Bako signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. At the end of spring training, he was added to the 40-man roster. Though he batted only .217, Bako appeared in a career-high 99 games in 2008, hitting six home runs and notching 35 RBIs. On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived \"folk hero\" Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues for the first time with Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, \"With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's a lot of fun to catch him.\" Manager Charlie Manuel, however, denied that Bako was scheduled to be Lee's personal catcher, as he had done for Maddux in 2001. \"[Bako]'s not his personal catcher... Of course you guys will write whatever you want to write. If you want him to be his personal catcher, go right ahead. But I'll handle it anyway, so it doesn't matter.\"\n\nAs the 2009 season wore on, regular catcher Carlos Ruiz spent some time recuperating from an injury, allowing Bako expanded playing time near the end of the season. From September 18 to 29, Bako played in all but one of the team's games; his best stretch was from September 24 through September 27, when he went 6-for-13 with two RBId over three games. He finished the year with a .224 batting average. After winning the National League East for the third consecutive year, the Phillies faced the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series, and the New York Yankees in the World Series; Bako did not appear in any games during the postseason. After the 2009 season, Bako filed for free agency; considered retirement, according to teammate Scott Eyre; and did not play during the 2010 season.\n\n, Bako is currently an equipment representative for the Marucci Bat Company, based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He and former Orioles first baseman David Segui are part-owners of the company.\n\nBako lives in his hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana, during the offseason. He has a wife, Laurie, and two children: a son named Will and a daughter, Abbey.\n"}

During his tenure with The Jordanaires, the group was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, the NACMAI (North American Country Music Association International) Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, Rockabilly Hall of Fame, and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Walker was also awarded the \"Avalon Award,\" the highest award given for contribution and accomplishment by his \"alma mater\", David Lipscomb University, in 2005.\nDuring the early 1960s, Ray Walker, Neal Matthews, Hoyt Hawkins, and Gordon Stoker helped mold the genre of country music known as \"The Nashville Sound\", singing backup harmonies to such artists as Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves.\n\nAlso known for his solo recordings, Walker has helped in the development of albums and CDs of \"a cappella\" composition performed by, among others, the Freed-Hardeman University Singers and the Harding University Choir. For years, Walker served as song director for \"The Amazing Grace\" bible program, produced by the Madison Church of Christ in the Nashville suburb. He has over 600 \"a cappella\" worship songs recorded, reportedly being heard in 77 nations. Walker has been recorded nearly every week since he was 13 years old. He began singing in public at 6 years old. In the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, he was sometimes recorded on 200 songs a week, as aids in church worship in spirit and truth series. Up to 2006, it is estimated that Walker has been recorded on more than 200,000 songs (including repeats for different services and classes), outside of his professional recording with the Jordanaires, and it is possible that he is the most recorded voice in the history of music over his 66 years of performing and teaching. The Jordanaires also backed up Elvis Presley for 15 years beginning in 1956 until he started doing two shows a night in Las Vagas.\n\nRay Walker is currently one of the ministers of the Waverly Church of Christ in Waverly, Tennessee.\n\nIn September 1954, Ray married Marilyn DuFresne.

{"id": "2055335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055335", "title": "Proletkult", "text": "Proletkult\n\nProletkult (), a portmanteau of the Russian words \"proletarskaya kultura\" (proletarian culture), was an experimental Soviet artistic institution that arose in conjunction with the Russian Revolution of 1917. This organization, a federation of local cultural societies and avant-garde artists, was most prominent in the visual, literary, and dramatic fields. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary working-class aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.\n\nAlthough funded by the People's Commissariat for Education of Soviet Russia, the Proletkult organization sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the Communist Party hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as Lenin, sought to concentrate state funding and retain it from such artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a concentration of bourgeois intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.\n\nAt its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis.\n\nThe earliest roots of the Proletarian Culture movement, better known as Proletkult, are found in the aftermath of the failed 1905-1907 Revolution against Nicholas II of Russia. The censorship apparatus of the Tsarist regime had stumbled briefly during the upheaval, broadening horizons, but the revolution had ultimately failed, resulting in dissatisfaction and second-guessing, even within Bolshevik Party ranks.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Tsar's reassertion of authority a radical political tendency known as the \"Left Bolsheviks\" emerged, stating their case in opposition to party leader Lenin. This group, which included such luminaries as philosophers Alexander Bogdanov and Anatoly Lunacharsky and writer Maxim Gorky, argued that the intelligentsia-dominated Bolsheviks must begin following more inclusive tactics and working to develop more working class political activists to assume leadership roles in the next round of anti-Tsarist revolution.\n\nAmong the Left Bolsheviks, Anatoly Lunacharsky in particular had been intrigued with the possibility of making use of art as a means to inspire revolutionary political action. In addition, together with the celebrated Gorky, Lunacharsky hoped to found a \"human religion\" around the idea of socialism, motivating individuals to serve a greater good outside of their own narrow self-interests.\n\nWorking along similar lines simultaneously was Lunacharsky's brother-in-law Bogdanov, who even in 1904 had published a weighty philosophical tome called \"Empiriomonism\" which attempted to integrate the ideas of non-Marxist thinkers Ernst Mach and Richard Avenarius into the socialist edifice. (Lunacharsky had studied under Avenarius in Zurich and was responsible for introducing Bogdanov to his ideas.) Bogdanov believed that the socialist society of the future would require forging a fundamentally new perspective of the role of science, ethics, and art with respect to the individual and the state.\n\nTogether all these ideas of Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Gorky, and their co-thinkers came to be known in the language of the day as \"god-building\" \"(bogostroitel'stvo).\"\n\nThese ideas did not exist in a vacuum; there was a political component as well. During the period between the failure of the 1905 revolution and the outbreak of World War I, Alexander Bogdanov stood as the chief rival to Lenin for leadership of the Bolshevik party.\n\nTo the intellectually rigid Lenin, Bogdanov was not only a political rival, but also a positive threat to the ideology of Marxism. Lenin saw Bogdanov and the \"god-building\" movement with which he was associated as purveyors of a reborn philosophical idealism that stood in diametrical opposition to the fundamental materialist foundation of Marxism. So disturbed was Lenin that he spent much of 1908 combing more than 200 books to pen a thick polemical volume in reply — \"Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy.\"\n\nLenin ultimately emerged triumphant in the struggle for hegemony of the Bolshevik faction. Relations between them in Western European exile remained tense. During the first decade of the 20th Century Bogdanov wrote two works of utopian science fiction about socialist societies on Mars, both of which were rejected by Lenin as attempts to smuggle \"Machist idealism\" into the radical movement. The second of these, a book called \"Engineer Menni\" (1913), was pronounced by Lenin to be \"so vague that neither a worker nor a stupid editor at \"Pravda\" [a rival publication] could understand it.\" In 1913 Bogdanov, a student of the Taylor system of factory work-flow rationalization, published a massive work on the topic, \"General Organizational Science,\" which Lenin liked no better.\n\nThe pair went their separate ways, with Bogdanov dropping out of radical politics at the end of 1913, returning home with his wife to Moscow. He would later be reinvigorated by the course of events to become a leading figure in the Moscow Proletkult organization — a fact which emphasizes the tension between that organization and state authorities.\n\nThe February Revolution of 1917 which overthrew the Tsarist regime came comparatively easily. So, too, did the October Revolution which followed, events which overthrew the Russian Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky and brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the seat of power. The Russian Civil War was another matter altogether — a long and brutal struggle which strained every sinew.\n\nThe radical intelligentsia of Russia was mobilized by these events. Anatoly Lunacharsky, who had briefly broken with Lenin and the Bolshevik Party to become a newspaper correspondent in France and Italy, returned to Russia in May 1917 and rejoined the party in August. Following the October Revolution, Lunacharsky was appointed Commissar of Education of the new regime.\n\nLunacharsky's factional ally, Alexander Bogdanov, remained sharply critical of Lenin and his political tactics and never rejoined the Communist Party, however. Instead he served at the front as a doctor during World War I, returning home to Moscow in 1917 and becoming involved there as a founder of the Proletarian Culture organization, Proletkult.\n\nThe aim of unifying the cultural and educational activities of the Russian labour movements first occurred at the Agitation Collegium of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet which met on 19 July 1917 with 120 participants. It was attended by many different currents, and when the Menshevik Dementiev suggested that the meeting just be confined to public lectures and that the Bolsheviks should be excluded, but this was soundly rejected. Consequently, the Central Council of Factory Committees was instructed to work with the Petrograd Soviet to organise a second conference of \"proletarian cultural-educational organizations\" to bring them together in a centralized organization. A first conference of these groups was held in Petrograd from October 16 to 19, 1917 . The conclave was called by Lunacharsky in his role as head of the Cultural-Educational Commission of the Petrograd Bolshevik organization and was attended by 208 delegates representing Petrograd trade unions, factory committees, army and youth groups, city and regional dumas, as well as the Petrograd Committee of the Bolshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties.\n\nThis October 1917 conference elected a Central Committee of Proletarian Cultural-Educational Organizations of Petrograd which included among its members Lunacharsky, Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, talented young journalist Larisa Reisner, and a long-time Vpered associate of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky named Fedor Kalinin, among others. Also playing a key role was Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii, another former member of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky's émigré political group. Many of these would be catapulted into leading roles in the People's Commissariat of Education following the Bolshevik seizure of power which followed less than two weeks later.\n\nThe October Revolution led to a marked increase in the number of new cultural organizations and informal groups. Clubs and cultural societies sprung up affiliated with newly empowered factories, unions, cooperatives, and workers' and soldiers' councils, in addition to similar groups attached to more formal institutions such as the Red Army, the Communist Party, and its youth section. The new government of Soviet Russia was quick to understand that these rapidly proliferating clubs and societies offered a potentially powerful vehicle for the spread of the radical political, economic, and social theories it favored.\n\nThe chief cultural authority of the Soviet state was its People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), a bureaucratic apparatus which quickly came to include no fewer than 17 different departments. Headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky, this organization sought to expand adult literacy and to establish a broad and balanced general school curricula, in opposition to pressure from the trade unions and the Supreme Council of National Economy, which sought to give preference to vocational education. The as-yet loosely organized Proletkult movement emerged as another potential competitor to the primacy of Narkompros.\n\nThis confusing welter of competing institutions and organizations was by no means unique to the cultural field, as historian Lynn Mally has noted:\n\nAll early Soviet institutions struggled against what was called 'parallelism,' the duplication of services by competing bureaucratic systems. The revolution raised difficult questions about governmental organization that were only slowly answered during the first years of the regime. Political activists disputed the authority of the central state, the role of the Communist Party within it, and the influence national agencies should wield over local groups. Altercations over scarce resources and institutional authority were intertwined with theoretical debates over the ideal structure of the new policy.\n\nMoreover, in the early revolutionary period control over local institutions by the central government of the Soviet state was weak, with factory workers often ignoring their trade unions and teachers the curriculum instructions of central authorities. In this political environment any centrally-devised scheme for a division of authority between Narkompros and the federated artistic societies of Proletkult remained largely a theoretical exercise. In the early days of the Bolshevik regime the local apparatus of Proletkult retained the most powerful hand.\n\nWith its adherent Anatoly Lunacharsky at the helm of Narkompros, the Proletkult movement had an important patron with considerable influence over state policy and the purse. This did not mean an easy relationship between these institutions, however. Early in 1918 leaders of Petrograd Proletkult refused to cooperate with an effort by Narkompros to form a citywide theatre organization, declaring their refusal to work with non-proletarian theatre groups.\n\nMoscow Proletkult, in which Alexander Bogdanov played a leading role, attempted to extend its independent sphere of control even further than the Petrograd organization, addressing questions of food distribution, hygiene, vocational education, and issuing a call for establishment of a proletarian university at its founding convention in February 1918. Some hardliners in the Proletkult organization even insisted that Proletkult be recognized as the \"ideological leader of all public education and enlightenment.\"\n\nUltimately, however, the vision of Proletkult as the rival and guiding light of Narkompros fell by the wayside, subdued by the Proletkult's financial reliance on the Commissariat for operational funding. Proletkult received a budget of 9.2 million gold rubles for the first half of 1918 — nearly one-third of the entire budget for Narkompros's Adult Educational Division. Requisitioned buildings were put to the organization's use, with the Petrograd organization receiving a large and posh facility located on one of the city's main thoroughfares, Nevsky Prospect — the name of which was actually changed to \"Proletkult Street\" \"(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)\" in the organization's honor.\n\nWhile the Proletkult movement began as independent groups in Petrograd (October 1917) and Moscow (February 1918), it was not long before the group's patrons in the Soviet state intervened to help forge a national organization. The Soviet government itself moved from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918 and the center of Proletkult's own organizational gravity shifted simultaneously.\n\nLines became blurred between the Proletkult organization and the Division for Proletarian Culture of the People's Commissariat of Education, headed by Proletkult activist Fyodor Kalinin. While the organization retained its staunch supporters in the Narkompros apparatus seeking to coordinate activities, it also contained no small number of activists like Alexander Bogdanov who tried to promote the organization as an independent cultural institution with a homogeneous working class constituency.\n\nIn September 1918, the first national conference of Proletkult was convened in Moscow, including 330 delegates and 234 guests from local organizations from around Soviet Russia. While no delegate list has survived, the stenogram of the conference indicates that the bulk of attendees hailed from trade unions, factory organizations, cooperatives, and workers' clubs. Delegates were split between those favoring an autonomous and leading role for the organization in general education in Soviet society and those who favored a more narrow focus for the group as a subordinate part of the Narkompros bureaucracy.\n\nWhile those favoring autonomy were in the majority at the first national conference, the ongoing problem of organizational finance remained a real one, as historian Lynn Mally has observed:\n\nAlthough the Proletkult was autonomous, it still expected Narkompros to foot the bills. The government would supply the central Proletkult with a subsidy, to be distributed among provincial affiliates. But because financial dependence on the state clearly contradicted the organization's claims to independence, the central leaders held out the hope that their affiliates would soon discover their own means of support.\n\nProletkult and its desire for autonomy also had another powerful patron in the person of Nikolai Bukharin, editor of \"Pravda.\" Bukharin provided favorable coverage for Proletkult during the organization's formative period, welcoming the idea that the group represented a \"laboratory of pure proletarian ideology\" with a legitimate claim to independence from Soviet governmental control.\n\nProletkult made use of different organizational forms. In large industrial cities, the organization set up an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus resembling that of Narkompros. Moscow Proletkult, for example, had departments for literary publishing, theatre, music, art, and clubs. In addition to this central bureaucracy, Proletkult established factory cells attached to the highly concentrated mills and manufacturing facilities. Finally, Proletkult established \"studios\" — independent facilities in which workers learned and developed the techniques of the various arts.\n\nNarkompros, for its part, sought to influence Proletkult to concentrate its efforts upon the expansion of the network of studios. In April 1919, People's Commissar of Education Lunacharsky declared that Proletkult \"should concentrate all its attention on studio work, on the discovery and encouragement of original talent among the workers, on the creation of circles of writers, artists, and all kinds of young scholars from the working class\".\n\nProletkult and its studios and clubs gained a certain measure of popularity among a broad segment of the urban Russian population, particularly factory workers. By the end of 1918 the organization counted 147 local affiliates, although the actual number of functioning units was probably somewhat fewer.\n\nAt the peak of the organization's strength in 1920, Proletkult claimed a total of 84,000 members in 300 local groups, with an additional 500,000 more casual followers.\n\nA total of 15 different Proletkult periodicals were produced over the course of the organization's short existence, including most importantly \"Proletarskaia kultura\" (Proletarian Culture — 1918 to 1921) and \"Gorn\" (Furnace — 1918 to 1923).\n\nHistorically, the relationship between the Russian liberal intelligentsia and the working class was that of teacher and student. This situation presumed a \"higher\" level of culture on the part of the aristocratic teachers — an accepted premise of the Bolsheviks themselves during the pre-revolutionary period.\n\nUnder Marxist theory, however, culture was conceived as a part of the superstructure associated with the dominant class in society — in the Russian instance, that of the bourgeoisie. Under a workers' state, some Marxist theoreticians believed, the new proletarian ruling class would develop its own distinct class culture to supplant the former culture of the old ruling order. Proletkult was seen as a primary vehicle for the development of this new \"proletarian culture.\"\n\nThe nature and function of Proletkult was described by Platon Kerzhentsev, one of the movement's top leaders in 1919:\n\nThe task of the 'Proletkults' is the development of an independent proletarian spiritual culture, including all areas of the human spirit — science, art, and everyday life. The new socialist epoch must produce a new culture, the foundations of which are already being laid. This culture will be the fruit of the creative efforts of the working class and will be entirely independent. Work on behalf of proletarian culture should stand on a par with the political and economic struggle of the working class.\n\nBut in creating its own culture, the working class by no means should reject the rich cultural heritage of the past, the material and spiritual achievements, made by classes which are alien and hostile to the proletariat. The proletarian must look it over critically, choose what is of value, elucidate it with his own point of view, use it with a view to producing his own culture.\n\nThis work on a new culture ought to proceed along a completely independent path. 'Proletkults' should be class-restricted, workers' organizations, completely autonomous in their activities.\n\nProletkult's theorists generally espoused a hardline economic determinism, arguing that only purely working class organizations were capable of advancing the cause of the dictatorship of the proletariat. An early editorial from the official Proletkult journal \"Proletarskaia Kultura\" (Proletarian Culture) demanded that \"the proletariat start right now, immediately, to create its own \"socialist forms of thought, feeling, and daily life,\" independent of alliances or combinations of political forces.\"\n\nIn the view of Alexander Bogdanov and other Proletkult theoreticians, the arts were not the province of a specially gifted elite, but rather were the physical output of individuals with a set of learned skills. All that was required, it was assumed, was for one to study basic artistic technique in a very few lessons, after which anyone was capable of becoming a proletarian artist. The movement by Proletkult to establish a network of studios in which workers could enroll was seen as an essential part of training this new cohort of proletarian artists.\n\nDespite the organization's rhetoric about its proletarian exclusivity, however, the movement was guided by intellectuals throughout its entire brief history, with its efforts to promote workers from the bench to leadership positions largely unsuccessful.\n\nProletkult expended great energy in attempting to launch a wave of worker-poets, with only limited artistic success. The insistence upon developing new poets of questionable talent led to a split of the Proletkult in 1919, when a large group of young writers, most of whom were poets, broke from the organization due to what they believed to be a stifling of individual creative talent.\n\nThese defectors from Proletkult initially formed a small, elite organization called Kuznitza (The Forge) before again launching a new mass organization known as the All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (VAPP) a year later.\n\nThe Proletkult organizations of Petrograd and Moscow controlled their own dramatic theatrical network, including under its umbrella a number of smaller city clubs maintaining their own theatrical studios. Petrograd Proletkult opened a large central studio early in 1918 which staged a number of new and experimental works with a view to inspiring similar performances in other amateur theaters around the city. Moscow Proletkult opened its own central theater several months later.\n\nProletkult constituted the leading center of a radical minority within the theatrical community of the day which aspired to promote so-called \"proletarian theater.\" Development of this new form was defined in one early conference resolution as \"the task of workers themselves, along with those peasants who are willing to accept their ideology.\" Conventional modes of performance were discouraged, in favor of unconventional stagings designed to promote \"mass action\" — including public processions, festivals, and social dramas.\n\nArtists in the Proletkult movement, while not by any means a homogeneous bloc, were influenced to a great extent by the iconoclasm, technological orientation, and revolutionary enthusiasm bound up in the thematic movements of the day, futurism and constructivism. Despite lip service paid to classical forms of poetry, drama, writing, sculpture, and painting, strong encouragement was given to the use of new techniques and forms in so-called \"proletarian art,\" including the use of photography, cinematography, and collage.\n\nThis commitment to experimentalism drew the fire of those party leaders who preferred more classical modes of artistic expression. Petrograd Communist Party leader Grigory Zinoviev took the lead at a conference of \"proletarian writers\" held in that city in the fall of 1919, declaring that while previously \"we allowed the most nonsensical futurism to get a reputation almost as the official school of Communist art\" and let \"doubtful elements attach themselves to our Proletkults.\" it was henceforth \"time to put an end to this,\" Zinoviev demanded.\n\nAlso among those critical of the Proletkult movement and its vision to create a wholly new proletarian culture was top Soviet party leader Vladimir Lenin. At a public speech in May 1919 Lenin declared any notions of so-called \"proletarian culture\" to be \"fantasies\" which he opposed with \"ruthless hostility.\"\n\nMore specifically, Lenin had profound misgivings about the entire institution of Proletkult, viewing it as (in historian Sheila Fitzpatrick's words) \"an organization where futurists, idealists, and other undesirable bourgeois artists and intellectuals addled the minds of workers who needed basic education and culture...\" Lenin also may have had political misgivings about the organization as a potential base of power for his long-time rival Alexander Bogdanov or for ultra-radical \"Left Communists\" and the syndicalist dissidents who comprised the Workers' Opposition.\n\nBy the fall of 1920, it became increasingly clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the Whites, a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident groups such as the so-called Workers' Opposition and the Democratic Centralists emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the peasantry over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.\n\nThroughout its short history, Proletkult had sought both autonomy from state control and hegemony in the cultural field. This had created a substantial number of critics and rivals. These included leaders of the Soviet trade union movement, who saw the management of workers' cultural opportunities as part of their own purview; local Communist Party committees, which sought centralization under their own direction rather than a hode-podge of autonomous civic institutions; and the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), which believed its own mission included the cultural training of the working class. Of these, Narkompros proved the most outspoken and unyielding in its criticism.\n\nEver since 1918 Nadezhda Krupskaya — the wife of Vladimir Lenin — had sought to rein in Proletkult and integrate it under the agency in which she herself played a leading role, the Adult Education Division of Narkompros. A May 1919 conference of adult education workers had, spurred on by Krupskaya, determined that Proletkult was an adult education agency owing to its studio system, and therefore rightfully part of Narkompros.\n\nBureaucratic wrangling between top leaders of Proletkult and the Adult Education Division of Narkompros had produced a working agreement in the summer of 1919 bringing Proletkult formally under the auspices of the latter, albeit with its own separate budget. This proved, however, to be a stop-gap and institutional conflict remained.\n\nProletkult leaders subsequently made an effort to expand their movement on an international basis at the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International in August 1920, founding Kultintern, an international organization headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky. The group's grandiose vision and practical efforts to expand the Proletkult movement globally was particularly concerning to Lenin, himself a man of staid and traditional cultural tastes who had already come to see Proletkult as utopian and wasteful.\n\nSpurred to action by Lenin, in the fall of 1920 the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) began to take an active interest in the relationship of Proletkult with other Soviet institutions for the first time. Lenin sought and obtained information from M. N. Pokrovsky, second in command at Narkompros, and top Proletkult leaders about the organization's budget and semi-independent status and pushed through a decision to absorb Proletkult into Narkompros to end the situation of parallelism once and for all.\n\nThe already scheduled National Congress of Proletkult, held in Moscow from October 5 to 12, 1920, was to be the occasion for the announcement. While Lunacharsky, head of Narkompros but a patron of Proletkult and its interests, dragged his feet on the merger, the congress eventually — following long debate and a stern appeal to party discipline — formally approved the Central Committee's decision to directly integrate Proletkult into Narkompros.\n\nThe integration was not a smooth one, however, and Proletkult activists fought to the last ditch to retain organizational autonomy even within Narkompros. The Central Committee reacted with a scathing decree denouncing Proletkult that was published in \"Pravda\" on December 1, 1920.\n\nDespite its formal termination as an organization, the Proletkult movement continued to influence and inform early Soviet culture. Historian Peter Kenez has noted the heavy influence of the Proletkult ethic in the work of pioneer Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, director of the classic films \"Strike\" (1925), \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (1926), and \"\" (1927):\n\nThe intellectual content of [Eisenstein's] early films was profoundly influenced by his earlier association with Proletkult, a complex politicocultural movement that reached the height of its influence during the revolutionary period. [...] [Its leaders] argued that the new, socialist culture would be profoundly different from what it replaced. In their view there could be no accommodation with the old world; the proletariat on the basis of its experience would create a new culture that would reflect the spirit of the collective. It followed that the new art had to emphasize not the accomplishments of individuals but those of the workers and peasants. Eisenstein was attracted to this movement because it justified the necessity of a complete break with the art of the 'bourgeois' world. All of his early films expressed, though in his own idiom, the ideology of Proletkult.\n\nIn 2018, the avant-garde writing collective Wu Ming published the New Italian Epic novel \"Proletkult\".\n\n\n\n"}

Edited by William Smith, the dictionary spans three volumes and 3,700 pages. It is a classic work of 19th-century lexicography. The work is a companion to Smith's \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities\" and \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography\".\n\nThe work lists thirty-five authors in addition to the editor, who was also the author of the unsigned articles. The other authors were classical scholars, primarily from Oxford, Cambridge, Rugby School, and the University of Bonn, but some were from other institutions. Many of the mythological entries were the work of the German expatriate Leonhard Schmitz, who helped to popularise German classical scholarship in Britain.\n\nWith respect to biographies, Smith intended to be comprehensive. In the preface, he writes:The biographical articles in this work include the names of all persons of any importance which occur in the Greek and Roman writers, from the earliest times down to the extinction of the Western Empire in the year 476 of our era, and to the extinction of the Eastern Empire by the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in the year 1453.\n\nMuch of the value of the \"Dictionary\" consists not only in the depth and detail of the individual articles, but in the copious and specific citations to individual Greek and Roman writers, as well as modern scholarship from the Renaissance to the mid-nineteenth century. The articles frequently note variant traditions, disagreements among the authorities, and the interpretations of modern scholars. However, due to the variable numbering systems used in different editions of classical works, and the difficulty of recognizing typographical errors in citations, the original sources should still be checked. Many of the \"Dictionary's\" articles have been referred to in more recent works, and Robert Graves has been accused of \"lifting his impressive-looking source references straight, and unchecked\" from it when writing \"The Greek Myths\".\n\nSamuel Sharpe thought Edward Bunbury had plagiarised his work, as he wrote of in his diary entry on 3 September 1850: I certainly felt mortified on reading the articles on the Ptolemies in Dr. Smith's \"Dictionary of Classical Biography.\" They were all written by E.

{"id": "2055363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055363", "title": "Master of Animals", "text": "Master of Animals\n\nThe Master of Animals or Lord of Animals is a motif in ancient art showing a human between and grasping two confronted animals. It is very widespread in the art of the Ancient Near East and Egypt. The figure is normally male, but not always, the animals may be realistic or fantastical, and the figure may have animal elements such as horns, or an animal upper body. Unless he is shown with specific divine attributes, he is typically described as a hero, although what the motif represented to the cultures which created the works probably varies greatly. The motif is so widespread and visually effective that many depictions were probably conceived as decoration with only a vague meaning attached to them. The Master of Animals is the \"favorite motif of Achaemenian official seals\", but the figures in these cases should be understood as the king.\n\nThe human figure may be standing, found from the 4th millennium BC, or kneeling on one knee, these latter found from the 3rd millennium BC. They are usually shown looking frontally, but in Assyrian pieces typically shown from the side. Sometimes the animals are clearly alive, whether fairly passive and tamed, or still struggling or attacking. In other pieces they may represent dead hunter's prey.\n\nOther associated representations show a figure controlling or \"taming\" a single animal, usually to the right of the figure. But the many representations of heroes or kings killing an animal are distinguished from these.\n\nThe earliest known depiction of the Master of Animals appears on stamp seals of the Ubaid period in Mesopotamia. The motif appears on a terracotta stamp seal from Tell Telloh, ancient Girsu, at the end of the prehistoric Ubaid period of Mesopotamia, c. 4000 BC.\n\nThe motif also takes pride of place at the top of the famous Gebel el-Arak Knife in the Louvre, an ivory and flint knife dating from the Naqada II d period of Egyptian prehistory, which began c.3450 BC. Here a figure in Mesopotamian dress, often taken to be a god, grapples with two lions. It has been connected to the famous Pashupati seal from the Indus Valley Civilization (2500-1500 BC), showing a figure seated in a yoga-like posture, with a horned headress (or horns), and surrounded by animals. This in turn is related to a figure on the Gundestrup cauldron, who sits with legs part-crossed, has antlers, is surrounded by animals and grasps a snake in one hand and a torc in the other. This famous and puzzling object probably dates to 200 BC, or possibly as late as 300 AD, and though found in Denmark was perhaps made in Thrace.\n\nA form of the master of animals motif appears on an Early Medieval belt buckle from Kanton Wallis, Switzerland, which depicts the biblical figure of Daniel between two lions. \n\nThe purse-lid from the Sutton Hoo burial of about 620 AD has two plaques with a man between two wolves, and the motif is common in Anglo-Saxon art and related Early Medieval styles, where the animals generally remain aggressive. Other notable examples of the motif in Germanic art include one of the Torslunda plates, and helmets from Vendel and Valsgärde\n\nIn the art of Mesopotamia the motif appears very early, usually with a \"naked hero\", for example at Uruk in the Uruk period (c. 4000 to 3100 BC), but was \"outmoded in Mesopotamia by the seventh century BC\". In Luristan bronzes the motif is extremely common, and often highly stylized. In terms of its composition the Master of Animals motif compares with another very common motif in the art of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean, that of two confronted animals flanking and grazing on a Tree of Life.\n\nAlthough such figures are not all, or even usually, deities, the term can also be a generic name for a number of deities from a variety of cultures with close relationships to the animal kingdom or in part animal form (in cultures where that is not the norm). These figures control animals, usually wild ones, and are responsible for their continued reproduction and availability for hunters. They sometimes also have female equivalents, the so-called Mistress of the Animals. Many Mesopotamian examples may represent Enkidu, a central figure in the Ancient Mesopotamian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". They may all have a Stone Age precursor who was probably a hunter's deity. Many relate to the horned deity of the hunt, another common type, typified by Cernunnos, and a variety of stag, bull, ram and goat gods. Horned gods are not universal however, and in some cultures bear gods, like Arktos might take the role, or even the more anthropomorphic deities who lead the Wild Hunt. Such figures are also often referred to as 'Lord of the forest'* or 'Lord of the mountain'.\n\n\"Potnia Theron\", a phrase used by Homer meaning \"Mistress of the Animals\" is used for early Greek depictions of goddesses, usually Artemis, holding animals. The Greek god shown as \"Master of Animals\" is usually Apollo, the god of hunting. Shiva has the epithet Pashupati meaning the \"Lord of animals\", and these figures may derive from an archetype. Chapter 39 of the Book of Job has been interpreted as an assertion of the God of the Hebrew Bible as Master of Animals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2055366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055366", "title": "Dracula's Daughter", "text": "Dracula's Daughter\n\nDracula's Daughter is a 1936 American vampire horror film produced by Universal Pictures as a sequel to the 1931 film \"Dracula\". Directed by Lambert Hillyer from a screenplay by Garrett Fort, the film stars Otto Kruger, Gloria Holden in the title role, Marguerite Churchill and features, as the only cast member to return from the original, Edward Van Sloan – although his character's name was altered from \"Van Helsing\" to \"\"Von\" Helsing\".\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of Count Dracula and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger). The Countess kidnaps Dr. Garth's fiancée, Janet (Marguerite Churchill), and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess in an attempt by him to save Janet.\n\nOstensibly based on a deleted chapter from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel \"Dracula\" – published in 1937 as a short story under the name \"Dracula's Guest\" – the film bears no resemblance to the source material. Modern sources also say that the film was loosely based on \"Carmilla\", an 1872 Gothic novella by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, which is often cited as the first published British work of fiction to deal with lesbian relationships.\n\nDavid O. Selznick purchased the rights to the Stoker material for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but Universal bought them in 1934, with the rights to revert to MGM if Universal did not begin production by October 1935, a date later extended to February 1936. Universal rushed the show into production in that month, with the script only partially completed, in order to meet this deadline. The film was first assigned to James Whale, but Universal production head Carl Laemmle, Jr. finally put Hillyer in the director's chair.\n\nWhile not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's alleged lesbian overtones, which Universal exploited in some early advertising.\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" begins a few moments after \"Dracula\" ends. Count Dracula has just been destroyed by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is arrested by two Whitby policemen, Sergeant Wilkes (E. E. Clive) and constable Albert (Billy Bevan). Von Helsing is sent by the Whitby police to Scotland Yard, where he explains to Sir Basil Humphrey (Gilbert Emery) that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because he had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger), who was once one of his star students.\n\nSergeant Wilkes leaves the Whitby gaol to meet an officer from Scotland Yard at the train station. Meanwhile, Dracula's daughter, Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden), enters the gaol and mesmerizes Albert with her jeweled ring and with the aid of her manservant, Sandor (Irving Pichel), steals Dracula's body from the Whitby gaol and after tossing salt on the pyre ritualistically burns Dracula's body, hoping to break her curse of vampirism. However, Sandor soon begins to discourage her telling her that all that is in her eyes is \"death.\" She soon gives in to her thirst for blood. The Countess resumes her hunting, mesmerizing her victims with her exotic jeweled ring. After a chance meeting with Dr. Garth at a society party, the Countess asks him to help her overcome the influence she feels from beyond the grave. The doctor advises her to defeat her cravings by confronting them and the Countess becomes hopeful that her will, plus Dr. Garth's science, will be strong enough to overcome Dracula's malevolence.\n\nThe Countess sends Sandor to fetch her a model to paint. He sees a pretty young woman, Lili (Nan Grey), and follows her onto a bridge. The woman pauses at the railing looking despondent. Sandor promises her food, warmth and money. She hesitates, but Sandor explains that he seeks her for his mistress. Lili returns with Sandor. Countess Zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth know that it was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth to Transylvania by kidnapping Janet Blake (Marguerite Churchill), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.\n\n\nUniversal originally did not hold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\", a chapter excised from Bram Stoker's original novel, which was published in 1937, after Stoker's death, as a short story and which was the purported source material for the film. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executive David O. Selznick negotiated a contract in 1933 with Stoker's widow, Florence, to buy the rights to the chapter for an advance of $500 against a purchase price of $5,000. MGM's lawyers and executives were worried about the use of the word \"Dracula\" in the film's title, fearing that Universal would take legal action, although Selznick's contract with Stoker explicitly listed \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a possible alternative title. The project was code-named \"Tarantula\" in correspondence. Universal bought the right from MGM in 1934, but they would revert to MGM if Universal did not begin production by October 1935, a date later extended to February 1936. Universal rushed the show into production in that month, with the script only partially completed, in order to meet this deadline.\n\nModern sources report that the film was also loosely based on \"Carmilla\", an 1872 Gothic novella by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, which is often cited as the first published British work of fiction to deal with lesbian relationships.\n\nSelznick hired John L. Balderston, who had previously worked on the 1931 \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\", to write the screenplay. Balderston's screenplay involved tying up loose ends from the original film. In it, Von Helsing returns to Transylvania to destroy the three vampire brides seen in \"Dracula\" but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing Dracula's daughter. She follows him back to London and operates under the name \"Countess Szekelsky\". She attacks a young aristocrat and Von Helsing and the aristocrat's fiancée track her back to Transylvania and destroy her. The script included scenes that implied that Dracula's daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control the men liked it too. Also included were shots of the Countess's chambers being stocked with whips and straps, which she would never use on-screen but whose uses the audience could imagine. Regardless of any objections that the Production Code Administration (PCA) would have raised to many aspects of the scenario, Balderston's script could never have been filmed because Selznick's contract with Stoker expressly barred him from using any Bram Stoker characters that did not appear in \"Dracula's Guest\". Selznick re-sold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\" to Universal in October 1934 or September 1935 for $12,500, which included the rights to Balderston's scenario. Horror film scholar David J. Skal theorizes that this was Selznick's actual motivation in buying the rights in the first place, to profit from Universal's desire for a sequel by tying up the only obvious source material. A condition of the sale was that the rights would revert to MGM if Universal did not start production by October 1935, later extended to February 1936.\n\nUniversal studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr. (nicknamed \"Junior\") wanted James Whale, fresh from his great success with \"Bride of Frankenstein\", to direct \"Dracula's Daughter\". Whale was idle, waiting for Irene Dunne to finish work on \"Magnificent Obsession\" so she could begin work on Whale's \"Show Boat\". Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called \"The Hangover Murders\". Laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct \"Dracula's Daughter\" next. Whale completed work on the film, \"Remember Last Night?\", on September 14, 1935. \"Magnificent Obsession\" completed filming on October 29. With Dunne freed up, Whale went to work on \"Show Boat\". Laemmle replaced him with A. Edward Sutherland, who was best known for his work on comedies. Sutherland had as little interest in \"Dracula's Daughter\" as Whale did and soon left the studio, so Hillyer came on to direct.\n\nA treatment by John L. Balderston was submitted to Universal in January 1934, and may have been presented to MGM earlier. Another short treatment by Kurt Neumann was rejected by Universal.\n\nThe earliest screenplay for the Universal film was written by R. C. Sherriff and submitted in July 1935. It began with three scenes set in the 14th Century and centered on the Dracula legend. It then switched to the present day, focusing on two engaged couples who visit Transylvania. The men explore the ruins of Dracula's castle. One is later found, insane, and the other goes missing. Professor Von Helsing is summoned and he tracks the missing man to London, where he is in thrall to Dracula's daughter, the Countess Szelinski (sic). When she attempts to flee with her thrall to the Orient by ship, Von Helsing and three others book passage on the same ship. During a violent storm, Von Helsing destroys Dracula's daughter and, with her hold over the men broken, the scenario closes with a double wedding. This version was submitted on August 28, 1935 to the British Board of Film Censors, which rejected it, saying in part \"...\"Dracula's Daughter\" would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\" On September 10 Sherriff met with BBFC representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later. This scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by the BBFC it is unknown how much it differed from the original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in the final script.\n\nUniversal submitted Sheriff's first draft to the Production Code Administration (PCA) on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA head Joseph Breen than it had from the British. Breen reported back that the script \"contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code\". A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted three days later and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who had no interest in the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of \"Show Boat\", encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film. On January 14, 1936, producer E. M. Asher advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch.\n\nScreenwriting duties were then assigned to Garrett Fort, who submitted a draft in January 1936, and a second draft in February. Asher, Fort and Universal executive Harry Zehner meet with Production Code officials in February 1936, during which Universal was asked that the scene in which Lili poses for Marya be written so that there was no suggestion that Lili was nude, or that there was any indication of a \"perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili.\"\n\nFort's February draft, as revised by Charles Belden in March 1936, seems to be the version used to shoot the film, which was viewed and passed by the PCA in April 1936. Fort is the only one of the various writers to receive screen credit along with Stoker.\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" was Gloria Holden's first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden looked down on horror films. She had also seen Bela Lugosi struggle over the years since \"Dracula\" was made to free himself from typecasting and feared that the role would lead to the same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance. \"Her disdain for the part translates into a kind of self-loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character.\"\n\nInitially Lugosi and Jane Wyatt were set to star in the film. Universal also announced that Boris Karloff and Colin Clive, who had starred together in \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\", would appear, and that Cesar Romero would play Dr. Garth. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Universal had sought Herbert Marshall for the role of Sandor, before casting Pichel. None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, in the form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.\n\nShooting on \"Dracula's Daughter\" began on February 4, 1936, rushed into production before Fort had completed the script, because of a deadline clause in Universal's option of the property from Selznick. The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks. The film was completed on March 10. Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule, filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.\n\n\"Dracula's Daughter\" was the last in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal said it was because a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was suspended because, just before filming on \"Dracula's Daughter\" had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of \"Dracula's Daughter\" to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released \"Son of Frankenstein\" in 1939.\n\nMakeup artist Jack Pierce and special effects supervisor John P. Fulton worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that contrasted with the more normally flesh-toned make-ups of the others in the scene. Heinz Roemheld composed the score and Albert S. D'Agostino redressed Charles D. Hall's set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave \"Dracula's Daughter\" a solid, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, review upon its release, citing the film's \"blood-curdling events\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden is a remarkably convincing bat-woman\" in concluding that the film is both \"quite terrifying\" and \"a cute little horror picture.\" \"Variety\" also praised the production and Holden's performance in particular. Despite critical approval, \"Dracula's Daughter\" did not have the same box office success as the original.\n\nLater reviews of \"Dracula's Daughter\" are sharply split. \"Entertainment Weekly\", reviewing the film following its video release, called it \"one of the most satisfying vampire pictures ever made\". Describing director Hillyer's visuals as \"lush, evocative, and suffused with just the right gothic chiaroscuro\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden, as the reluctant vampire protagonist, absolutely drips patrician eroticism\", \"EW\" concludes that this film is better than Lugosi's original \"Dracula\".\n\nRyan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while echoing the praise for Holden's performance, nonetheless found that the film \"doesn't hold up so well today\". Citing what he sees as slow pacing and \"long bouts of over-the-top dialogue\", Cracknell compares the film to \"reading a textbook – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later.\" Michael W. Phillips, Jr. concurs, calling the film \"a marked improvement on the original film [but] still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright.\" Phillips again praises Holden's performance and also Pichel's portrayal of Sandor, but finds the rest of the cast weak.\n\nHorror author Anne Rice has named \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction. She named a bar in her novel \"Queen of the Damned\" \"Dracula's Daughter\" in honor of the film. Author Ramsey Campbell, under the pseudonym \"Carl Dreadstone\", wrote a novelization of the film also entitled \"Dracula's Daughter\" that was published in 1977. A juvenile fiction version, written by Carl R. Green, William R. Sanford and Howard Schroeder, was published in 1985. Some observers have suggested that the film served as an inspiration for \"Sunset Blvd.\", noting similarities between the outlines of each film. Michael Almereyda's 1994 film \"Nadja\" has been described as an \"unofficial remake\" of \"Dracula's Daughter\".\n\nThe lesbian vampire has been a trend in literature dating back to Joseph Sheridan le Fanu's 1872 novella \"Carmilla\". \"Dracula's Daughter\" marked the first time that the trend was incorporated into a film. The lesbian implications of \"Dracula's Daughter\" were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, \"This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor.\" The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's Harry Zehner asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote:\n\nThe present suggestion that ... Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire. The whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili.\n\nGay film historian Vito Russo noted in his book \"The Celluloid Closet\" that Universal highlighted Countess Zaleska's attraction to women in some of its original advertising for the film, using the tag line \"Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!\" He further cited Countess Zaleska as an example of the presentation of the \"essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness\". Some reviewers of the day picked up on and condemned the lesbian content, including the \"New York World-Telegram\" which noted the Countess's tendency to wander around \"giving the eye to sweet young girls\". Other reviews missed it entirely, including the aforementioned \"The New York Times\" which advised \"Be sure to bring the kiddies.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" describes the encounter between the Countess and Lili as \"so hot it's impossible to imagine how it ever got past '30s censors\" whereas \"Time Out London\" finds only a \"subtle suggestion\" of lesbianism. Horror scholar Skal notes that the scene has come to be seen as a \"classic 'lesbian' sequence, although of a decidedly negative stripe\". The scene between Countess Zaleska and Lili was included in the 1995 documentary film adaptation of Russo's book.\n\nAnother lesbian-tinged scene which has received less critical attention comes when the Countess is holding Janet captive. Described as \"the longest kiss never filmed\", Countess Zaleska \"hovers lovingly over Janet ... hovers ... and hovers ... slowly descending to kiss the recumbent Janet...\" until interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Garth.\n\n\"Bright Lights Film Journal\", after noting that \"Gloria Holden in the title role almost singlehandedly redefined the '20s movie vamp as an impressive Euro-butch dyke bloodsucker\", draws an implicit comparison between Countess Zaleska's seeking to cure her vampirism through psychiatry and the former position of mainstream psychiatry of homosexuality as a mental illness (a view still held by a minority in the profession). Zaleska's cruising the streets of London is seen as parallel to cruising for sex (although that tends to be a gay male activity) and as suggesting \"society's image of the lesbian as soulless predator\" but the conclusion is that \"Holden's striking, masklike face and haunting, luminous eyes [are] the intoxicating essence of transgressive lesbian power.\"\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The game starts off with only four characters, but a Boss Code can unlock the other seven characters. The game has three modes: Story Mode, 1-Player to CPU Mode (fighting against each boss individually, except the last one), and Multiplayer Mode. The fighting system is based on buttons: two for kicks and two for punches (light and fierce, respectively). All characters have at least two special attacks. In all modes, the more life anyone loses, the more bloody the characters' faces become, much like in SNK's \"Art of Fighting\" series; however, like the final epilogues of the main characters, were removed from the North American and European versions.\n\nThere are ten stages in story mode, where either Kotono, Syoh, Vortz and Zazi fight. After picking a character, the player must fight the other three in a tournament-style fashion. After fighting the other heroes, the player must fight the six guards leading to Jado. After fighting Jado, there is an ending sequence (only in the Japanese version) followed by a screen saying to go to hard mode, or a congratulations for the completion of beating hard mode. After beating hard mode, the closing credits show a clip of the players' battles with the enemies faced. The four main characters' skills evolve over story mode, featuring an RPG-like element, meaning their special moves become slightly larger and more powerful after each group of opponents are defeated. \n\nThe story is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth in the year AD 2151. To the inhabitants on Earth it seems like the only chance for a decent life is to fight, in a \"survival of the fittest\" scenario. A man named Jado finds a powerful blue fighting armor and calls himself \"The Fighting King\". With it, he quickly gains control of the world. Using his newfound power, he erects a tower with six guards. Many try to take Jado's power away, but they die in their attempt. Some weeks after the building of the tower, a tournament is held all over the world to see who is the strongest. Of the many fighters, only four people are chosen. Now they need to fight each other to see who is going in the tower. The plot dialogues of the Story mode and the final epilogues were excluded from the North American and European versions.\n\nPlayable characters:\n\nCPU opponents:\n\nThe original Japanese cover art to \"Dead Dance\"/\"Tuff E Nuff\" is taken from an issue cover of the UK gaming magazine \"Computer and Video Games\". \"CVG\" created the artwork for their preview feature as there was none available at the time. Jaleco were so impressed with the design, they asked \"CVG\" to make it the official artwork for the game. It appears on the Japanese and European versions of the game. Jaleco USA decided to use their own box art instead for the American release which is often considered to be one of the worst designs for a video game of all time. It can be seen in the first level of the original arcade version of Jaleco's \"Game Tengoku\".\n\nThe game received positive reviews from \"Super NES Buyer's Guide\". Martin Alessi called \"Tuff E Nuff\" one of the best \"Street Fighter II\" clones on the SNES, giving it a score of 81%; Howard Grossman gave it 78%. A review in \"Super Play\" ranked \"Dead Dance\" as the second best beat'em up on the SNES, having dethroned the previous second choice, \"\". Jonathan Davies gave it a score of 78%, calling it \"a pretty good beat'em up with plenty of depth and challenging gameplay. Ultimately, though, it's not as good as \"Street Fighter II\".\"\n\n"}

He served as Commander-in-chief of Bangladesh Forces during the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence. Osmani's career spanned five decades, beginning with service in the British Indian Army in 1939. He fought in Burma during World War II, and served in the Pakistan Army until 1967. Osmani was appointed head of the Bengali armed resistance in 1971 by the Provisional Government of Bangladesh, and he is regarded as the founder of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. Osmani retired from the Army in 1972.\n\nOsmani entered politics in independent Bangladesh, serving as a member of parliament and cabinet minister in the government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He resigned from the government after opposing the creation of BAKSAL.\nOsmani was born to a landowning family in Sunamganj, Assam Province, British India, on 1 September 1918. He was a descendant of Shah Nizamuddin Osmani, a 14th-century associate of Shah Jalal. His ancestral village is in Dayamir Union within Osmani Nagar Upazila of Sylhet District.\n\nOsmani attended Cotton School in Sylhet, matriculating at Sylhet Government Pilot High School in 1934. He studied English and Persian. He won the Pritoria Prize for excellence in English. Osmani studied geography at Aligarh Muslim University, and graduated in 1938. He enrolled as a cadet at the Indian Military Academy the following year.\n\nWhen he joined the British Indian Army, Osmani was a member of the 4th Urban Infantry from 1939 to 1940. On 5 October 1940, he received an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC). Osmani was initially attached to the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Wellington Regiment, which was tasked with a New Delhi depot. After he completed the Short Mechanical Transport Course (November 1940 - February 1941) and Junior Tactical Course (February - April 1941), he was attached to a mechanical transport battalion of the XV Corps and posted to Burma during World War II.\n\nOsmani was promoted to the ranks of war-substantive lieutenant and temporary captain on 17 February 1941. He received a battlefield promotion to acting major on 23 February 1942, with further promotions to war-substantive captain (temporary major) on 23 May. Between 1941 and 1945, he held the posts of platoon commander, battalion adjutant, company 2IC and battalion commander. From November 1944 to February 1945, Osmani was a grade-two general staff officer at his formation headquarters, completing the Senior Officers Course after the war.\n\nHe was attached to British Indian Army HQ Bihar and Orissa Area from May to July 1946. On 13 July 1946, Osmani was granted a regular commission in the British Indian Army, with a promotion to substantive captain on 5 October 1946. He subsequently completed the Senior Officers Course in February 1947, and was promoted to local lieutenant colonel. He was posted to British Indian Army GHQ in Simla in the Quartermaster General and Ordnance Branches until August 1947. From August to 6 October 1947 he served as GSO-2 at the HQ of Claude Auchinleck in New Delhi. Although Osmani had passed the Indian Civil Service examination, he declined a foreign-service position in 1947 to remain with the Pakistan Army. He witnessed the end of the British Indian Army, representing Pakistan during the division of army assets between India and Pakistan.\n\nAfter the 1947 birth of India and Pakistan in 1947, Osmani joined the Pakistan Army on 7 October 1947. He was promoted to acting lieutenant colonel on 7 January 1948. He was assigned to general-staff headquarters as GSO-1, Coordination, Planning and Personnel.\n\nOsmani attended the Long Term Staff Course at the Quetta Staff College and served with Yahya Khan, Tikka Khan and A. A. K. Niazi, all of whom led the Pakistan Army against his Bangladesh forces in 1971. After completing the course, Osmani joined the staff of army chief of staff Reginald Hutton in January 1949 and (as chair of a committee tasked by Douglas Gracey to evaluate army enlistment standards) recommended the establishment of cadet colleges in East Pakistan. He later became an assistant adjutant general.\n\nAfter serving as a staff officer for eight years, Osmani joined the Pakistan Army infantry. With a rank of major and after induction training, he joined the 5/14 Punjab. He was posted as 2IC and company commander of the 5th Punjab Battalion of the 14th Punjab Regiment, part of a brigade commanded by Ayub Khan, in 1950. Osmani became commander of the 105th Brigade Training Team in January 1951 and commander of the 5/14 Punjab in May, followed by a four-month tour of duty in Kashmir and Waziristan.\n\nOsmani disagreed with Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army Gen. Ayub Khan over the treatment of Ishfakul Majid, the senior Bengali army officer in who was falsely accused in the Rawalpindi conspiracy and forced to resign. In August 1951 Osmany left 5/14 Punjab and was posted as third CO of the 1st East Bengal Regiment, the first Bengali to hold the post, in October.\n\nOsmani became the CO of the 1st East Bengal Regiment, stationed in Jessore as part of the 107th Brigade, on 8 November 1951. He chose Bengali songs for regimental marching and its band (\"Chol Chol Chol\", \"Gram Chara oi ranga matir poth\" by Rabindranath Tagore and \"Dhono Dhanne Pushpe Bhora\" by D.L. Roy), and the \"Brotochari\" (introduced by Shodoy Dutt) became the regimental dance. Osmani ordered his NCOs to submit daily situation reports in Bangla. This display of Bengali culture was frowned on by his Punjabi superiors, who disliked the adoption of what they saw as Hindu culture. Osmani was commandant of the East Bengal Regimental Center in Chittagong from February 1953 to January 1955.\n\nHe commanded the 107th Brigade in Jessore from April to October 1953 (when he was promoted to major), rejoining 1 EBR as CO until February 1954. After Osmani completed the GHQ law course and left the EBRC, he became an additional commandant (later deputy director) of the East Pakistan Rifles under the provincial government of East Bengal in March 1955. In the EPR, he expanded the recruitment of non-Bengali minority groups and ended recruiting from West Pakistan.\n\nOsmani was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became a senior advisor at CENTO headquarters in Baghdad as part of the Pakistan military delegation from December 1955 to May 1956. He was promoted to acting colonel in May 1956, joining the Pakistan Army GHQ at Rawalpindi as deputy director for military operations (DDMO). In August and September 1957 he served as an acting brigadier, serving as DDMO until May 1966. Osmani received the permanent rank of colonel in 1961, and received advanced weapons training in the United States three years later. He served under Gul Hassan Khan in 1964, who felt that Osmani had been passed over for promotion. Khan allowed him to focus on the Bengal regiments.\n\nBy 1958 Osmani was deputy director of the general staff and then deputy director of military operations under Yahya Khan, a position he held until his retirement eight years later. Although he reached the rank of colonel in the first decade of his career, during the next decade he did not receive a promotion. During Osmani's tenure as DDMO in the General Staff Branch, he was a Pakistan Army advisor at CENTO, SEATO and Pakistan Air Defense Committee meetings.\n\nPakistan mustered six infantry divisions and one armored brigade after the division of the British Indian army in 1947. These formations were neither fully equipped nor staffed. The number of Bengali officers and soldiers in the Pakistan armed forces was small, due to the British preference for recruiting from the martial races and the departure of many non-Muslim Bengali personnel for the Indian Army. The Pakistan Army raised two battalions of the East Bengal Regiment from 1947 to 1950, and Punjab regiments were inherited from the British Indian Army. The Azad Kashmir Regiment was created soon after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.\n\nWhen Osmani joined GHQ in 1956, three East Bengal regiments and the East Bengal Regimental Centre (EBRC) were part of the Pakistan Army. Over the next nine years the number of Punjab regiments grew (reorganized in 1956) reached almost 50, the Frontier Force and Baluch Regiments grew. Many senior army officers believed in the martial-race theory, and considered Bengalis poor military material. Bengali recruits, generally smaller in stature than West Pakistanis, often failed to meet minimum physical requirements (which were based on average West Pakistani physical characteristics). Many Pakistani officers favored mixed regiments over Bengali ones and some officers felt that increasing the number of Bengali formations threatened Army unity.\n\nOsmani was sidelined by the Pakistani generals, despite his service as DDMO during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Instead he devoted himself to the East Bengal regiments. He complained that the Pakistani press suppressed the contributions of his 1st Bengal unit, which was posted in Kasur during the war. Successive Bengali and non-Bengali COs of the 1 EBR built on Osmani's foundation, and under the command of A. T. K. Haque its battalion received 17 awards for gallantry (including two Sitara-e-Jurats and nine Tamgha-i-Jurats)—the largest number of awards of any Pakistan unit in the war. When Osmani visited the unit and recommended a Nishan-e-Haider for a member, he was reportedly furious when the battalion CO disregarded his recommendation. He organized Bengal regimental reunions, seizing every opportunity to enhance the reputation of Bengali units.\n\nAfter the war, Osmani chaired the committee tasked with determining future army-reserve and logistical requirements and was president of the Army Sports Control Board from July 1965 to April 1966. On 16 May 1966, he went on leave prior to retirement (LPR). Osmani's successor as DDMO was Rao Farman Ali, who played a controversial role in the 1971 Bangladesh War. Ali was reportedly horrified at Osmani's treatment by the army; his office was run-down, Osmani was kept out of the loop and office employees treated him with disdain. According to Ali, Osmani was not promoted because he was Bengali and deemed untrustworthy by the high command.\n\nOsmani retired from the Pakistan Armed Forces on 16 February 1967. Although he had failed to increase the number of Bengal regiments, the Pakistani high command (at the recommendation of Maj. Gen. Khwaja Wasiuddin) put the existing regiments through a battery of exercises in West Pakistan to test their adaptability and combat readiness. The evaluator of the exercises said the Bengali units performed well, their pride in representing East Pakistan a component of their success, and opposed their replacement with mixed regiments.\n\nThe Pakistani high command did not increase the number of Bengali units until 1969, when (after a pledge by Yahya Khan) the number of Bengal regiments were increased to 10 and all new units were ordered to ensure a minimum 25-percent annual Bengali representation among their recruits. Osmani, known as \"Papa Tiger\", was revered by the Bengali troops because of his efforts on their behalf. Although he was not the senior Bengali officer (Ishfakul Majid, commissioned out of Sandhurst in 1924, was older) and did not reach the highest Bengali rank in the Pakistani army (as did Lt. General Khwaja Wasiuddin), Osmani, Wasiuddin and M. H. Mozumdar were patrons of the Bengali troops.\n\nOsmani was not directly involved in the Agartala Conspiracy Case. Those involved sought his opinion through Khandker Nazmul Huda (Accused No. 27, sub-sector commander of the BDF in 1971 and a Bangladesh Army colonel in 1975), and Osmani recommended a political solution for the discrimination faced by Bengalis in Pakistan. He had been questioned in 1958, before the trials began, on issues related to the case.\n\nAfter his retirement Osmani entered East Pakistani politics, joining Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's All Pakistan Awami Muslim League in 1970. As an Awami League candidate, he was elected to the national assembly from the Balaganj-Fenchuganj Upazila area of Sylhet. Osmani did not serve as a Pakistani MNA, because after the beginning of the Bangladesh War of Independence he joined its provisional government.\n\nOsmani and Ishfakul Majid formed part of the military advisory team for the Awami League leadership in 1971. As the political crisis deepened in March, many Bengali officers of the Pakistan Armed Forces looked to Bengali politicians for guidance and Osmani coordinated the clandestine meetings. Bengali military officers, alarmed by the buildup of Pakistani forces and concerned about their own safety, maintained contact with Rahman; some maintained contact with Awami League leaders through Osmani, who reportedly agreed to coordinate the activities of Bengali units. Toeing the party line, he advised the officers (including M. R. Mazunder, Chittagong martial-law administrator and Rezaul Jalil, CO of the 1st EBR) against \"rash\" actions.\n\nBefore the crackdown the student and youth wings of the Awami League set up training camps and trained volunteers with Bengali helpers and student cadets. The league leadership declared independence on 7 March 1971. Bengali ex-servicemen held rallies supporting independence; officers and troops kept abreast of the political situation in East Pakistan, which was becoming uncertain and confrontational. Majid and Osmani reportedly designed a military plan of action: capture the Dhaka airport and Chittagong seaport, sealing off the province. The EPR and police would capture Dhaka, aided by Awami League volunteers, and cantonments would be neutralized by Bengali soldiers. Bengali officers advised sabotaging the fuel dumps at Narayanganj and Chittagong to ground Pakistani air power and cripple armed-force mobility.\n\nThe Awami League leadership, attempting a political solution, did not endorse action or preparation for conflict by Bengali soldiers before the crackdown. Warnings by Bengali officers that the Pakistan Army was preparing to strike were ignored, and junior Bengali officers were told by their superiors to be prudent and avoid political issues.\n\nThe Pakistan Army caught the Bengali political leadership and soldiers by surprise. Resistance to Operation Searchlight was spontaneous and disorganized, and nearly all the Awami League leadership fled to Calcutta. Bengali soldiers were largely unaware of the larger situation; many units performed routine duties as late as 31 March, rebelling only under Pakistani attack. A general amnesty for Bengali troops suggested by Pakistani generals on 31 March was ignored. Group Captain A.K. Khandkar witnessed the departure of Yahia and warned Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of Pakistani troop movements. His 26 March declaration of independence was largely unnoticed. No countrywide communication reached Bengali soldiers to begin the uprising; they rebelled when they were attacked or heard news of the Pakistani attack.\n\nOsmani was at the home of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman when Bengali officers informed Awami League leaders of Yahia Khan's departure and the army movements. After Rahman refused to go into hiding, Osmani hid in Dhaka until 29 March, shaved off his mustache (he was known as \"the man attached to a mustache\") and left for the Indian border. He went to Jingira, then by boat to Daudkandi (where suspicious residents detained him before the brother of the local member of parliament helped free him). Osmani walked and crossed the Gomoti by boat (with the help of a Bengali army signal corps officer), reaching India by 2 April 1971.\n\nOsmani arrived at Teliapara, where the 2nd and 4th East Bengal Regiments (EBR) established a temporary base with a member of the BSF on 2 April 1971. He held a meeting of Bengali officers on 4 April, attended by M. A. Rab, 2 EBR CO K. M. Shafiullah, 4 EBR CO Khaled Musharraf, 8 EBR CO Ziaur Rahman, Salahuddin Reza, Qazi Nurujjaman and Shafat Jamil. Osmani proposed that the 2nd and 4th EBR occupy Comilla, and asked Jaman to formulate a fireplan. After objections by other officers that the battalions would incur crippling losses, the proposal was dropped.\nZia proposed that all available forces surround Chittagong, to hold the area as long as possible; this idea was also dropped as impractical. The commanders agreed to send two companies (one each from 2 and 4 EBR) to aid the 8th EBR under Ziaur Rahman.\n\nFive sector commanders were appointed by Osmani: Ziaur Rahman (Chittagong area), Khaled Musharraf (Comilla), K M Shafiullah (Sylhet), Abu Osman Chowdhury (Kushtia-Jessore) and Salahuddin Reza (Mymensingh area). On 7 April, he instructed Q. N. Jaman to oversee operations in Sylhet. The officers agreed that a government in exile should be formed, with the Bengali forces under its authority.\n\nOsmani toured Mukti Bahini positions in Sylhet, and on 9 April he visited Aziz with 2 EBR Charlie Company near Sylhet. That day another conference took place, attended by Director General Rustomji of the BSF and Bengali officers. At the meeting Osmani was elected commander of Bengali forces, and an agreement was reached with Indian officers on logistical assistance. The need to form a Government in exile was agreed, to distinguish the struggle from a mere military revolt. The conference abruptly adjourned when Osmani left after he heard that five PAF jets were inbound. The following day, three more sector commanders were appointed: Nazmul Huq (Rajshahi-Pabna) and captains for Rangpur-Dinajpur and Barisal. The Pakistan Army appointed A. A. K. Niazi GOC for East Pakistan the same day. On 12 April, the Bengali government in exile at Agartola appointed Osmani commander of the Mukti Bahini. With the formation of the Bangladesh government on 17 April 1971, he was reinstated to active duty and appointed commander-in-chief.\n\nOsmani took command of the Mukhti Bahini after 17 April 1971. Since the Bengali forces were geographically isolated and lacked command staffs and a communications network, real-time command was impossible. Osmani allowed the sector commanders to fight as they saw fit, while he toured the sectors and met with Indian officials in New Delhi and Kolkata concerning weapons and communications. Although India did not offer material aid, it helped design Mukhti Bahini structure and expressed the possibility of future Indian intervention.\n\nThe Bengalis put up an unexpectedly stiff resistance, derailing the initial Pakistani estimate of pacifying East Pakistan by 10 April. Their initial success was unsustainable. They began experiencing a lack of trained men, officers, coordination, a central command structure and supplies (despite some aid from the BSF) although most of the country was still free of Pakistani control. The Pakistani Army airlifted its 9th and 16th Infantry Divisions to Bangladesh by 10 April, and was poised to seize the initiative. Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi, after a briefing by the departing East Pakistan GOC, implemented a strategy to clear all large cities of insurgents and secure Chittagong; to control and open all river, road and rail networks; to drive the insurgents away from the country's interior, and to launch combing operations across Bangladesh to wipe out the insurgency.\n\nBengali field commanders adopted a strategy of \"holding as much area for as long as possible\". The Bengali political leadership hoped to keep the Pakistanis confined to the cities, while the government in exile sought diplomatic recognition and the resistance prepared for guerrilla warfare and awaited expected Indian military intervention.\n\nThe Pakistan opposed military action against civilians in East Pakistan out of concern for an Indian attack. After the crackdown, Tajuddin Ahmed met with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 3 April and requested additional aid. BSF was offering limited aid to the resistance. The case for intervention was based on the fact that until 10 April, most of Bangladesh was outside Pakistani control; troops were confined to a few cities and faced stiff resistance. The eastern Indian naval contingent (one aircraft carrier and several warships) was stronger than Pakistan's, and could have blockaded Bangladesh. Pakistani forces, flying in reinforcements from West Pakistan from 26 March to 2 May, depended on supply depots in Dhaka, Chittagong and Narayanganj for fuel and ammunition. the Indian army's adequacy and suitability, logistics, the possibility of a war lasting into monsoon season and India's international appearance as an aggressor.\n\nAlthough some Bengali leaders and Indian officers expected prompt Indian military intervention, Sam Manekshaw explained to the Indian cabinet that the army's Eastern Command would not be ready until 15 November at the earliest. The Indian government chose involvement over intervention; Eastern Command took over East Pakistan operations on 29 April, and on 15 May it launched Operation Jackpot to arm, train, equip, supply and advise the Mukti Bahini. An Indian diplomat told Osmani that an expectation of Indian armed intervention in April was unrealistic.\n\nFrom April to June Osmani toured to boost morale and gather information, meeting with his Indian counterparts and setting up the Bangladeshi command structure. The Indian Army launched Operation Jackpot; by mid-June Bengali soldiers were driven into India, developing the infrastructure for a sustained, coordinated guerrilla campaign. Although the Bengali high command had begun to rebuild and redeploy Mukti Bahini units in mid-May, in June and July, Mukti Bahini activity slacked off and the insurgency faltered. Running the war was difficult because of the shortage of trained officers. From 17,000 active-duty Bengali soldiers (Army and EPR) who faced Pakistan on 25 March 1971, about 4,000 were taken prisoner.\n\nA sector coordinators' conference, chaired by Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad, was held by the government in exile from 10 to 15 July. Osmani was absent on the first day of the conference, since he had resigned as commander-in-chief the previous day. A group of Bengali officers had discussed the creation of a war council, headed by Ziaur Rahman with the sector commanders as members, and Osmani was expected to become defence minister. The plan, presented by Q. N. Zaman and supported by Ziaur Rahman, was for a separate operational wing to run the war and lessen the burden on Osmani. Osmani, possibly misinterpreting its intent, resigned, but returned to his post the following day. The conference defined the operational area, strength, command structure and role of the Mukti Bahini. Osmani remained commander-in-chief with M. A. Rab as chief of staff and A. K. Khandker as deputy chief of staff. Bangladesh was divided into 11 combat sectors, with commanders selected (or reconfirmed) for each. Of the eleven proposed sectors eight were organized and active by July, with sectors five and eleven following in August. Sector 10 (east of Teknaf and Khagrachari) was never activated, and it was incorporated into sector one.\n\nThe Mukti Bahini was divided into regular forces and freedom fighters. The regular forces consisted of defecting Bengali soldiers and retired Pakistan Army and EPR personnel. They were organised into three battalions, later known as Z, K and S Force. The shortage of trained regular troops meant that most of the forces were former EPR troops or new recruits. Trained army, EPR and police personnel were formed into sector troops: lightly armed conventional units commanded by army officers. The freedom fighters were primarily deployed within Bangladesh.\n\nAlthough Osmani made strategy decisions and liaised with Indian officers from July to December 1971, he did not organize an operation like the Tet Offensive or lead a battle similar to Dien Bien Phu as commander-in-chief. His strategy (a product of his military career and the demands of the situation on the ground) influenced his leadership style, and he relied on his background in the Southeast Asian sector during World War II.\n\nOn 15 May the Indian Army began to help build the liberation force, and an Indian officer was appointed liaison between the Bangladesh government in exile and the Indian Army. Khaled Musharraf and Osmani met at Teliapara in Sylhet District and prepared a paper on war strategy. Osmani's differed with the Indian Army on the size of the Mukti Bahini; the Bangladesh government had hoped to raise a regular force of 30,000 soldiers and 100,000 guerrillas in 1971, which the Indians thought unrealistic.\n\nOsmani was a conventional soldier with orthodox views, and his initial strategy reflected his background. Uncertainty over the timing, scope and scale of Indian military intervention was another influence. Osmani decided to raise a conventional force of regular battalions and use them to free an area around Sylhet, organizing countrywide guerrilla activity as a secondary effort. The Bangladesh government in exile asked Osmani to use the one abundant resource available (manpower), and he did not object to the plan of sending thousands of guerrillas into Bangladesh with minimal training. It was hoped that some of the guerrillas would attain expertise through experience.\n\nThe Indian planners were concerned that a hastily raised force would lack the trained leadership needed for an effective campaign. They had envisioned a force of about 8,000 with at least three to four months of training, led by EBR and EPR personnel, to begin small-cell operations in Bangladesh by August 1971.\n\nOsmani's stubbornness irritated the Indians, who considered Khandkar easier to work with. Although they raised three additional battalions and three artillery batteries, they insisted that the guerrillas be given due attention and Osmani did not object. He disagreed with the Indians on the location of the free area; they suggested Mymensingh, but Osmani opted for Sylhet and got his way. While the EBR battalions prepared, in July the Mukti Bahini began deploying 2,000-5,000 guerrillas in Bangladesh each month. At the sector commanders' meeting, the Mukti Bahini agreed to increase raids and ambushes and destroy power stations, railway lines, storage depots, communications systems, bridges and culverts, fuel depots, trains and watercraft to thin out Pakistani forces and increase their vulnerability.\n\nThe Pakistan army, after expelling the Mukti Bahini from Bangladesh by May 1971, experienced relative peace in June and July. Mukti Bahini activity had lessened during the months of preparation. The Indian army began shelling border outposts (about half of the 370 outposts were destroyed by the end of July) to facilitate infiltration into occupied territories. Bengali regular forces were not ready for operation until mid-July. With the conflict largely centred around the India-East Pakistan border region, the Pakistani Eastern Command began reorganizing their forces to consolidate control of the province. An East Pakistan Civil Armed Force, with 17 operational wings,) was raised from West Pakistani and Bihari volunteers, Razakars (50,000), Al-Badr and Al Shams (5,000 from each unit). Five thousand police were flown in from West Pakistan.\n\nPakistani authorities continued their campaign, rejecting calls for political compromise and a general amnesty. The army deployed in the towns, and the paramilitary units were deployed in the countryside. EPCAF took over the border-control and internal-security duties of the defunct EPR. Pakistani forces occupied 90 crucial border outposts. \"Ad hoc\" units were often created by adding EPCAF troops and Razakars to a skeleton army formation for deployment in forward areas.\n\nMukti Bahini numbers and activity began increasing in June, the Pakistan Army deployed Razakars and the EPCAF. Unable to match the Indians shell for shell, they relied on barrages in selected areas and developed an intelligence network. Denied permissio to launch preemptive cross-border strikes, artillery ambushes were laid for Mukti Bahini infiltrators and demining operations conducted. Bengali regular forces attacked BOPs in Mymensingh Comilla and Sylhet with mixed results, and Pakistani authorities concluded that they had contained the Monsoon Offensive.\n\nThe sector commanders reviewed Mukti Bahini activities from June to August, and Osmani made an overall assessment in September. The findings were disappointing; their network had not taken root, with many guerrillas withdrawing under Pakistani pressure. Amid Mukti Bahini supply problems, Bangladesh was losing ground in the international arena. Although regular Bengali regular troops attacked the BoPs with spirit, more training, better communication and coordination with the Indian Army were needed for a successful conventional campaign. The attack on Kamalpur by the 1st EBR was repulsed, but the 3rd EBR attack on Bahadurabad was successful; attacks by the 2nd, 11th and 4th EBR had mixed results.\n\nThe failure of the Monsoon Offensive required the Bangladeshi high command to rethink their strategy. Osmani initially considered dismantling the Z, K and S Forces, sending platoons from the forces to aid the Mukti Bahini. Although his associates prevailed against this, he deployed the Z Force battalions to aid the Mukti Bahini around Sylhet.\n\nOsmani did not micro-manage, delegating responsibility to the shorthanded sector commanders; the distance between Kolkata and the sector HQs and the absence of direct links (communications were channeled through the Indian Army) gave him little choice. The absence of an integrated command structure made it impossible to quickly implement strategy. Osmani lived a Spartan life, wore simple clothes, ate soldiers' food and used camp furniture in Kolkata during the war, acting as an example for his men.\n\nHe insisted on protocol when dealing with his Indian counterparts. As commander-in-chief, Osmani's position equaled that of Sam Manekshaw; to the Indians, his stubbornness in dealing with the lieutenant generals made him difficult to work with. He was pragmatic enough not to allow protocol to impede the war effort, and did not see Indians working through Khandker as circumventing his authority.\n\nWith a brusque manner and volatile temper, Osmani sometimes criticised subordinates in public. He discussed the framework of the future Bangladesh army and other issues unrelated to the war while touring the front, to the bemusement and irritation of fellow officers. Osmani opposed politicising the Bangladesh forces (supported by Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed), appointing officers on merit. Although only Awami League members were initially recruited for the Mukti Bahini for security reasons, in September Osmani opened recruitment to all willing to fight for Bangladesh (again with the prime minister's support). Although sector commanders had previously recruited Awami League nonmembers, Osmani turned a blind eye.\n\nHe used his image and place in the Bangladesh forces to his advantage. Osmani's problem-solving ability was limited to the agenda of India and the Bangladesh government in exile. He would often break a deadlock by threatening to resign. Osmani's bluff was called only once; when Bangladesh forces were placed under the joint command headed by J. S. Aurora, Ahmed agreed to accept a written resignation and Osmani dropped the issue.\n\nAlthough Osmani was commander-in-chief of all Bangladesh forces, a number of units were beyond his control. Bengali fighters raised bands to fight the Pakistanis in several areas of Bangladesh (the Kaderia Bahini, led by Tiger Siqqiqi of Tangail is the best-known), and they operated independently. Although Osmani was unconcerned, the Mujib Bahini worried the Bangladesh government in exile. The Mujib Bahini leadership, initially allowed by Osmani to recruit students and other youths, had an organized, well-armed, trained force with a primary allegiance to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and their commanders rather than the Bangladesh government.\n\nNo one doubted the skill of the Mujib Bahini or their commitment to Bangladesh. Trained by Sujan Singh Uban, an Indian Army insurgency expert, they operated under the direction of the R&AW and outside the Bangladesh chain of command. Mujib Bahini members were better trained and armed than their Mukti Bahini counterparts. The Bangladeshi government and military leadership were concerned because most Mujib Bahini recruits were former Mukti Bahini members. Mujib Bahini activities often hindered Mukti Bahini operations, creating misunderstanding and distrust. Clashes occurred between the groups, and the Indian Army and other organizations supporting the Bengali resistance were dissatisfied with Mujib Bahini activity.\n\nThe government in exile unsuccessfully attempted to bring the Mujib Bahini under Osmani by diplomatic means, approaching R&AW director Ramnath Kao. By August it was clear that their independence was detrimental to the war effort. Osmani threatened to resign unless they were brought within the chain of command. A meeting with Durga Prasad Dhar on 29 August produced an agreement that Mujib Bahini would inform sector commanders before beginning operations. After another meeting with Ramnath Kao on 18 September, R&AW did not relinquish their control of the Mujib Bahini.\n\nOn 21 October Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed met with Indira Gandhi, who ordered Dhar to resolve the issue. He told B. N. Sarkar to meet with Mujib Bahini leaders and take the necessary steps. Although the leaders did not attend the meeting, the Mujib Bahini halted their disruptive activities. They and the Special Frontier Force under Uban liberated Rangamati in December and helped the Indians dismantle the insurgent Mizo network.\n\nOsmani was not in Dhaka for the surrender ceremony on 16 December 1971. His helicopter, flying from Sylhet, was hit in midair by gunfire and crash-landed in a field. After the crash, the injured Osmani and his crew were rescued by an Indian surveillance jeep. Out of touch with Indian and Bangladeshi HQ, he could not reach Dhaka in time for the ceremony.\n\nThe Bangladeshi government issued four medals of valor to the freedom fighters: the Bir Sreshtho, Bir Uttom, Bir Bikrom and Bir Protik. The list of recipients was made by Osmani and several sector commanders at the beginning of 1972. When it was published, it was criticised and initially cancelled; Osmani was accused of bias for supporting the list.\n\nAfter the war ended with the surrender of the Pakistan armed forces to the joint command of India and Bangladesh on 16 December 1971, Osmani arrived in Dhaka on 22 December and set up his HQ (probably in the Log Area HQ Building in the Dhaka cantonment). On 9 January 1972, he arranged an honor guard to greet Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on his return to Tezgaon Airport. The Bangladeshi government decided promoted him to a two-star ranked officer (the first in Bangladeshi history) through a battlefield promotion to maintain the chain of command in the army. He was promoted on 7 April 1972, effective retroactively on 16 December 1971.\n\nOsmani and the Mukti Bahini senior sector commanders met in Dhaka from 2 to 11 January 1972 to discuss the future of the Bangladesh armed forces and other issues. Wounded sector-eleven commander Abu Taher and the commander of the closed sector nine were not present. A committee was set up to form a national militia from the Mukti Bahini and members of the former East Pakistan Rifles. Sector-three commander A. N. M. Nuruzzaman was chosen to command the militia.\n\nThe armed forces were reorganized, with Army, Navy, Air Force and Police personnel ordered to join their respective organizations and former EPR members joining the new National Militia.\n\nOn 16 February 1972, tension between Mukti Bahini members and former EPR members who had not fought in the war erupted into a shootout in Pilkhana. Although Osmani was informed of the incident, he was unable to enter Pilkhana due to the ongoing gunfire. The firing stopped at the arrival of President Mujibur Rahman, and Osmani and Rahman defused the situation. It was decided to keep the EPR intact as the Bangladesh Rifles and create another force, Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, from the Mukti Bahini members. In April 1972 the Bangladeshi government abolished the post of commander-in-chief, replacing it with a Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Air Staff and Chief of Naval Staff to separate the services' command structures.\n\nAlthough Osmani may have hoped to become defense minister, when the government abolished the post of commander-in-chief he retired from the Army on 7 April and was appointed Minister for Air and Inland Water Transport five days later (armed-forces personnel may not hold political office).\n\nOsmani resigned from the cabinet in May 1975, after the introduction of a one-party government in accordance with the fourth amendment to the constitution. He and Mainul Hosein resigned from the Awami League in protest of the abolition of democracy in Bangladesh by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Osmani briefly was an advisor to the president on 29 August 1975, after Rahman's assassination.\n\nM. A. Rab, the first Chief of Staff of the Bangladesh Army (12 April 1971 - 7 April 1972), was promoted to major general and retired on 7 April 1972. Osmani, reportedly consulted about his successor, recommended K. M. Shafiullah. The four serving senior army officers who joined Mukti Bahini in March 1971 from the Pakistan Army were Salahuddin Mohammad Reza, C. R. Dutta, Ziaur Rahman and Shafiullah.\n\nZiaur Rahman joined the war on 25 March 1971, and Shafiullah joined three days later. Although they were commissioned in the Pakistan Army on the same day (completing the 12th PMA Long Course on 18 September 1955), Rahman was above Shafiullah in the final rankings. Osmani disliked Rahman, and wanted to discharge him after the battle of Kamalpur. However, Osmani may not have made a recommendation and Shafiullah's appointment may have been a political decision.\n\nIn 1972, the Bangladeshi government issued a presidential decree in 1972 changing the cadet colleges to government colleges. A delegation of former cadets visited Ziaur Rahman, who helped them obtain an appointment with Osmani. Osmani discussed the issue with President Mujib Rahman, and the decree was withdrawn.\n\nKhwaja Wasiuddin was the most senior ranked East Pakistani officer in the Pakistan Army after the forced retirement of Maj. Gen. Ishfakul Majid in 1951. Wasiuddin was ranked Lieutenant General commanded the Pakistan Army's II Corps in 1971 (based in Multan, Punjab). He planned to defect but was unable to do so when he was posted to Rawalpindi Army HQ as the master general of ordnance. After Pakistan's defeat, he opted for Bangladesh and was interned in his home. Wasiuddin went to London in October 1972 before coming to Bangladesh. Osmani and Wasiuddin served together in 1959 at Rawalpindi GHQ, and they had a cordial relationship.\n\nOsmani met Wasiuddin at the airport, and introduced him to Awami League leaders. At age 54, Wasiuddin's experience would have benefited the Bangladesh Army. It was rumoured that Osmani would recommend him to the government as Army Chief of Staff, but some Mukti Bahini members of the army staff threatened to resign. Although Osmani was reportedly hurt by the turn of events, Wasiuddin received an ambassadorship. When Shafiullah (who replaced Rab as Chief of Staff in April) asked Rahman about the rumours, the president reportedly said that only a tested patriot would be a chief of staff.\n\nOsmani did not support the 15 August 1975 assassinations, and did not tolerate undue criticism of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He accepted a post as defense advisor (the equivalent of a cabinet minister) to Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who took over as president after the 15 August coup and may have been involved. Osmani, who ignored advice to avoid the Mushtaq government, was appointed to the post after Ziaur Rahman was appointed Army Chief of Staff on 24 August 1975 and Khalilur Rahman became Chief of Staff in the Defense Ministry. Although it was a cabinet post, Osmani did not draw a salary. He visited several Army formations, stressing the need for discipline and morale, and may have hoped to prevent further bloodshed with his influence on the armed forces. As defense advisor, he did not oppose the promotion of the 15 August coup leaders or the reinstatement of retired army officers involved in the coup. The coup leaders had installed themselves in Bangabhaban, disregarding the army chain of command, and Osmani accepted the situation. He tried to implement the decision to disband the Jatya Rakshi Bahini, placing its members in police and \"anser\" organizations, before Ziaur Rahman received approval to integrate Rakshi Bahini formations into the army in October 1975. The coup leaders maintained control of the 1st Bengal Lancer and 2nd Field Artillery units (involved in the 15 August coup) and deployed outside the army chain of command. Their actions, demonstrating the weakness of the chain of command, created a \"de facto\" parallel command structure.\n\nWhen Khaled Musharraf learned of the killing of four political leaders in Dhaka Central Jail, he and some staff went to Bangabhaban to negotiate a peaceful transfer of power. Khandker Mushtaq and Osmani spent the day negotiating, and Shaffat Jamil came to Bangabhaban to meet Musharraf. As he and his soldiers entered the meeting room, he heard Mushtaq browbeating Musharraf: \"I have seen many brigadiers and general of [the] Pakistan Army! Don't try to teach me.\" This angered the CO of the 1st Bengal Company, who drew his gun and said: \"And now you will see majors of [the] Bangladesh Army.\" Mushtaq dropped to the floor, Osmani stood between him and the officer and asked Shaffat Jamil to restore order. After Mushtaq resigned and a new government was formed, Osmani resigned.\n\nIn 1983, at age 65, Osmani was diagnosed with cancer at the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Dhaka and was flown to London for treatment at St Bartholomew's Hospital at government expense. Most of his time in the UK was spent at the home of his nephew and niece, Mashahid Ali and Sabequa Chowdhury. He died on 16 February 1984. Osmani's body was flown to Bangladesh, and he was buried with full military honours adjacent to his mother's grave in Darga, Sylhet.\n\nOsmani, nicknamed \"bongobir\" (Hero of Bengal), had a major role in organising the Bangladesh armed forces. The international airport in his hometown, Sylhet, was named \"Osmani Antorjatik Biman Bondor\" (Osmani International Airport) for him. MAG Osmani Medical College and the city's state-run hospital also commemorate him. \"Osmani Memorial Auditorium\" in Dhaka, Osmani Primary School is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The Osmani Museum is in Sylhet.\n"}

He was arguably the most valiant of the military leaders of Bangladesh War of Independence. Khaled was the Sector Commander of Bangladesh Forces Sector 2 and K Force (Bangladesh) Brigade Commander during the Bangladesh War of Independence. He fought heroically for Bangladesh's independence and was wounded in front line combat against the Pakistan Army. Under his command K-Force played a crucial role in the unconditional surrender of the Pakistani Army on 16 December 1971. On 23 October, while commanding an operation of the K-Force, Khaled Mosharraf was gravely wounded by enemy fire and required a long period of recovery. \nMore than thirty five thousand guerilla fighters fought under Khaled's command in sector 2. Following independence, he was raised to the rank of Major General– the highest rank in the army at that time –and appointed Chief of Army Staff. He was awarded Bir Uttam for his gallantry actions during the war. Mosharraf led 3 November 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état against the Mushtaq Administration who had conspired and seized power in Bangladesh in 1975 post the assassination of Bangladesh President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, but during the military uprising on 7 November, he was himself overthrown and assassinated.\n\nKhaled Mosharraf was born in the village of Mosharraf Ganj in Islampur, Jamalpur District, of the province of Bengal, British India (now in Bangladesh). He was born on 9 November 1937 at village Mosharrafganj in Islampur upazila of Jamalpur district, to Mosharraf Hossain and Jamila Akhter. His father was a jute merchant, Khaled's hometown Moshharrafganj was named after his father. He moved to stay with his maternal uncle SR khan, who was serving as C&B Engineer in Cox’s Bazar. He passed the matriculation examination from Cox's Bazar Government High School in 1953. He gained admission in Dhaka College from where he started his journey as political activist during that time. Khaled Mosharraf was often described as a brilliant student with excellent oratory skill. As a young student he was active in political event of the then East Pakistan the language movement of 1952. He was elected one of the panel secretary of Dhaka CollegeAwami League. Graduating from the Dhaka College in 1955, he joined the Pakistan Army. He became adjutant of the 4th Bengal regiment during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. He served as an instructor at the military academy and obtained an advanced degree from the Command and Staff College in Quetta. He was trained in West Germany and the United Kingdom before becoming commander of the 4th Bengal Regiment during the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nAfter 25 February 1971, the Pakistan Army occupied the capital, Dhaka, and the rest of the country and carried out brutal 1971 Bangladesh Genocide. Major Mosharraf was appointed commanding officer of the 4th battalion of East Bengal Regiment in Comilla Cantonment on 24 March 1971. Of all three Brigade Commanders Khaled Mosharraf was the one who most accurately assessed the psychological aspect of the war. Khaled decided to adopt a two-pronged, mutually reinforcing strategy to fight Pakistan Army and he was successful on both counts. He led his brigade in mutiny following the declaration of independence on behalf of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 26 March 1971.\nAs early as the last week of March, Khaled contacted Rehman Sobhan to convince the political leadership that a Government is formed with immediate effect, and to formally commission Mukti Bahini as the Army of Independent Bangladesh.  As Khaled felt without a Government and commission, Mukti Bahini would be considered illegitimate rebels or terrorists in the eyes of the law and Pakistan Government could take advantage of that situation. Khaled’s request had been duly inscribed in the declaration by Tajuddin Ahmad.\nLater the ‘legally constituted’ in this oath of freedom fighters was also commanded by Khaled.\nOn the evening of 26 March, he announced, \"From this moment on, I pledge allegiance to sovereign Bangla. From this day, we have no loyalties to Pakistan. Raise the flags of independent Bangla.\" He merged his unit into a guerrillaforce and later served as one of its leading commanders.\n\nIn the article “Khaled Musharraf, Bir Uttam - The Commander” the author wrote:\nKhaled Mosharraf successfully led The Crack Platoon, a guerrilla unit in Sector 2. The first guerrilla operation of Crack Platoon was carried out in Dhaka on June 9, 1971. Khaled raised this special guerrilla force composed of the students of the city’s major educational institutions, young professionals, and political activists of Dhaka. Under Khaled's leadership Crack Platoon carried out number of heroic operations in the Pakistan Army occupied capital and around Dhaka. Bombs were exploded and major Power stations were blown up. From June 1971 onwards, these guerrilla units started launching attacks one after the other on different establishments in the city including Intercontinental Hotel Dhaka and USIS Building using hit-and-run tactics. The occupying Pakistan army failed to organise any auxiliary force in support of its occupation in Dhaka.\n\nKhaled mosharraf played a key role in the historical meeting of Teliapara. The meeting was attended by M. A. G. Osmani, Major Ziaur Rahman, Major K M Shafiullah, Major Shafayat Jamil, and Major Kazi Nuruzzaman and few other officers of Revolted Bengal Regiment. Major Khaled’s role was instrumental to make Bangladesh Forces of the Liberation War a formidable and sustainable and few officer who were presentbat the historic Telipara meeting acknowledged the fact that Khaled Mosharraf had set the trend and planned strategy to fight against the Pakistan Army It was decided The whole area of East Pakistan would be divided into 11 sectors with the direction of regular forces consisted of the three forces: Z Force (Bangladesh) under the command of Major Ziaur Rahman, K Force (Bangladesh) under Khaled Mosharraf and S Force (Bangladesh) under K M Shafiullah.\n\nKhaled built the largest training center and operations headquarters for Bangladesh's freedom fighters in Melaghar, Tripura in 1971. He was determined not give the occupying Pakistan Army in Dhaka a moment's relief. Sector No. 2’s daring campaigns covered a vast territory including Dhaka, Comilla, Noakhali, Madaripur and Shariatpur.\n\nWhile the War was ongoing, the K Force (Bangladesh) was created under his leadership. Under his command, the valiant fighters of the Crack Platoon and K Force (Bangladesh) led one audacious operation after another and constantly routed the Pakistani army. Due to the properly strategised operations of this sector the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in between was denied to the Pakistanis throughout the nine months of war of liberation and stretched Pakistan Army's supply lines, which made it exceptionally difficult for Pak Junta to conduct counterinsurgency measures inside Bangladesh.\nKhaled merged his unit into a guerrilla force and later served as one of its leading commanders. Guerrilla fighter Shafi Imam Rumi took training for the war in Melaghar, Agartala under Sector-2, supervised by Mosharraf and Abu Taher Mohammad Haider. After his training, he came to Dhaka to join the Crack Platoon, a group that conducted major guerrilla operations against the Pakistan Army. His major target was to bomb the Siddhirganj Power Station.\nKhaled and his forces didn't rest after targeting structures inside the capital, he was determined to hamper the Pakistan Army’s supply line, hence, he devised strategies to destroy bridges and culverts across Bangladesh.\n\nAt the end of June 1971, Shahadat Chowdhury and Habibul Alam came to Rumi's ( Son of Jahanara Imam ) father Sharif's house with a letter from Khaled Mosharraf. Khaled asked for information on bridges and culverts of Bangladesh to hamper the Pakistani occupation army's movement. Khaled sent letter asking the experts and engineers for a detailed informations to identify the structural weaknesses in each bridge, and also on the exact points where to set explosives so that the bridge will be damaged, but also so that it can be repaired easily after the country is liberated.\n\nIn the book “Bullets of 1971” author wrote, “khaled revolted against the Pakistan authority in Brahmanbaria where he was stationed at that time. He led the Bengali soldiers under his command out of the pakistani cantonment and ambushed a Pakistani convoy going to Chittagong. Major khaled's troop destroyed the enemy convoy. The damage to the enemy was unprecedented. \nIn retaliation pakistan authority sent a larger continent under the command of a Major General to capture Khaled dead or alive. \nMajor khaled fought ferociously against the enemy with limited resources. However, once again, the Pakistani Army suffered heavy damages at Major khaled Mossharraf's hands and the enemy was forced to retreat.\n\nAfter the battle Pakistan High Command acknowledged the bravery of Major khaled Mosharrof and admitted, \"We have trained Major Khaled so well that even a Major General wasn't enough to defeat him.\" Khaled Mosharraf was also held in high esteem by his Freedom Fighter colleagues who fought under him during the liberation war. Freedom fighter Habibul Alam, Bir Pratik in his book \"Brave of Hearts\" wrote:\nFollowing the Bangladesh War of Independence and the establishment of an independent Bangladesh, Mosharraf was appointed as the staff officer to the HQ of the new Bangladesh Army in Dhaka. In 1973 after attaining the rank of brigadier, he was appointed to the post of Chief of General Staff. He was also awarded the military honour \"Bir Uttom\" for gallantry by the independent government of Bangladesh in 1972.\n\nIt was a time people of Bangladesh were still reeling from the shock of losing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's president, on 15 August 1975, a new government composing of anti-Mujib political elements was formed under Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad.\nMushtaq Ahmad immediately took control of the situation, proclaiming himself as President. Major General Ziaur Rahman was appointed as Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army, replacing K M Shafiullah.Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad praised those derailed military officials (killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) calling them shurjo shontan (sons of the sun). These disgruntled officers who killed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman captured the Bangabhaban (president's official residence) and started dictating the President, causing extreme chaos in barely four year old Nation. Khaled Mosharraf who was the Chief of General staff of Bangladesh Army, had asked Ziaur Rahman for the chain of command in Bangladesh Army to be restored which had been rudely interrupted 15 August. But the Chief of Army Staff (Bangladesh) General Ziaur Rahman, did not display the slightest ability or intention or both to act against the killers.\nAhmed also ordered 4 national leaders (former Vice-President Syed Nazrul Islam, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Tajuddin Ahmed and Captain (Rtd.) Mansur Ali, and former Home Minister A H M Quamruzzaman to be put behind the bar as they declined to support the \"illegitimate government\" and eventually killed just ahead of a counter-coup that ousted the August plotters. The prosecution evidence suggested Mushtaq himself had ordered the assassins entry inside the prison to kill the four leaders.\nkhondaker Mostaq Ahmad even issued the Indemnity Ordinance, which gave immunity from prosecution to the killers of Mujib, later the ordinance was passed by Ziaur Rahman.\nOutraged at Mujib's killing and the protection of his killers, khaled Mosharraf mobilized pro-Mujib army units with Colonel Shafaat Jamil of 46 Brigade to overthrow Ahmad's regime on 3 November. His main motive was to bring back the chain-of-command in the Bangladesh Army, and to achieve that Khaled Mosharraf decided to stop these killers residing inside the Bangabhaban and staged a coup d'état among the Army.\nOn 3 November 1975, under his order, the Bangladesh Army brought an end to the illegal rule of Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. Khaled Mosharraf freed Bangabhaban from the evil occupation of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. According to his order the Chief of Military Staff of the Bangladesh Army Major General Ziaur Rahman was put under house arrest.\n\nAfter he had Ziaur Rahman and other members of the government arrested and khaled took charge as Chief of Army Staff. \nAfter assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman no one could get into the street to protest. A procession was brought out from Dhaka University area to Bangabandhu’s Dhanmondi Residence to pay homage to Bangabandhu. \nKhaled’s mother and brother Rashed Mosharraf had led a commemorative procession to Mujib's family residence without his knowledge. However, a mutiny on 7 November consisting of left-wing non-enlisted personnel in the army, organized and led by the radical left wing JSD leader Abu Taher, resulted in the assassination of Mosharraf. Describing the 7 November Mutiny Captain Sachin Karmakar in The Daily Observer (Bangladesh) wrote:\nAs recorded by history, 7 November 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état was launched by left winger Colonel Abu Taher.</ref He organized the soldiers loyal to him to free Ziaur Rahman who had been put under House Arrest. Some jawans from the Bengal Lancers and 2 Field Artillery came over to urge the 10th East Bengal troops to join the mutiny. The trouble seems to have spread rapidly. Pro Abu Taher forces broke the military armoury to loot stockpiles weapons and boarded military trucks in order to take control of all the key installations points (KIP) around the city. A contingent of soldier went in military chief's residence in Dhaka Cantonment and freed Ziaur Rahman from house arrest. \nAs soon as Ziaur Rahman was free they were killed by pro Ziaur-Taher officers. Major Jalil and Major Assad pull their guns on three 1971 Liberation War heroes - General Khaled, Colonel Hayder and Colonel K.N Huda in a coup .\n\nOn 6 November 1975, Major General Mosharraf, with two others fellow officers, Colonel Najmul Huda and Colonel A.T.M. Haider, went to 10th East Bengal Regiment. Next morning, i.e., on 7 November 1975, at 11 am, under order of an officer from the 2nd Field Regiment Artillery (rumoured to be Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed, later executed on 28 January 2010 for killing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman), Captain Asad and Captain Jalil of the 10th East Bengal Regiment shot and killed Mosharraf and his two fellow officers. Ironically, both Asad and Jalil fought in K force under Mosharraf during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and Mosharraf had once saved Asad's life while risking his own. Mosharraf's body was left under a date tree inside cantonment for a certain time. This cruel and dastardly killing of Major General Khaled Mosharraf changed the course of the Bangladesh’s fate forever.\n\nKhaled Mosharraf was survived by his wife Salma Khaled and three daughters Mahjabeen, Ammereen and Taireen. His eldest daughter Mahjabeen Khaled was a Member of Parliament (MP) from her ancestral area of Islampur Upazila in Jamalpur District of Mymensingh Division. She also served as a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mahjabeen Khaled is also the Chairperson of Khaled Mosharraf Trust. Khaled’s brother Rashed Mosharraf was the President of Bangladesh Krishak League. Rashed Mosharraf was elected to the parliament from his Jamalpur constituency six times and served as a minister of state.\n"}

This finch is a resident breeding bird in tropical South America in northern Colombia and northern Venezuela (where it's called \"cardenalito\"). The introduced population on Trinidad is believed to be extinct, with no sightings since 1960.\n\nSome hope has been given to this highly endangered species by the discovery in 2003 of a population of several thousand birds in southern Guyana, 1000 km from any previously known colony. Otherwise the world population is believed to be between 600-6000 pairs.\n\nThe red siskin is found in open country, forest edges and grassland with trees or shrubs. The female is believed to lay 3 greenish white eggs in a grassy cup nest in a tree. It was common in the early twentieth century, occurring throughout the foothills of northern Venezuela but has now become extremely rare in a fragmented range.\n\nThe red siskin is about 10 cm long. The male is mainly deep red, with black on the head, throat, flight feathers and tail tip, and a whitish lower belly and under tail. The female is grey on the head, breast, and upper parts, apart from a red rump and upper tail. The breast is grey with reddish flanks, and the rest of the underparts, the wings and tail resemble the corresponding areas of the male. Immature females are paler than the adults, and immature males are brown rather than red.\n\nThe call is a high-pitched chitter and sharp \"chi-tit\" like Indian silverbill, and the male's song is a musical goldfinch-like melody with twitters and trills.\n\nRed siskins eat seeds and are highly gregarious. When they were more numerous they formed semi-nomadic flocks.\n\nThe siskin has been illegally trapped for the cage bird trade and endangered by environmental factors. Domestication has probably been responsible for the continuation of the species, which might overwise be extinct. This is an attractive finch with a pleasant song, and its unique coloration for a small finch (most are predominantly yellow) has led to it being used for interbreeding with domesticated canaries to produce varieties with red in the plumage.\n\nResearchers at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute lead a program, the Red Siskin Initiative, with the goals of uncovering more about this species and preventing its extinction.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2055412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055412", "title": "Ogoni people", "text": "Ogoni people\n\nThe Ogoni people (also known as the Ogonis) are people in the region of Southeastern Senatorial district in Rivers State Nigeria. They now number about over two million people and live in a homeland which they also refer to as Ogoni, or Ogoniland. They share common oil-related environmental problems with the Ijaw people of Niger Delta. \n\nThe Ogoni rose to international attention after a massive public protest campaign against Shell Oil, led by the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), which is also a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO).\n\nThe territory is located in Rivers State on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea, east of the city of Port Harcourt. It extends across the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Khana, Gokana, Eleme and Tai. Traditionally, Ogoniland was divided into the six kingdoms: Babbe, Gokana, Ken-Khana, Nyo-Khana, Eleme and Tai. Nyo-Khana is on the East while Ken-Khana is on the west.\n\nThere are multiple languages spoken by the Ogoni. The largest is Khana, which mutually intelligible with the dialects of the six kingdoms, Gokana, Tae (Tẹẹ), Eleme, and Baen Ogoi part of the linguistic diversity of the Niger Delta.\n\nAccording to oral tradition, the Ogoni people migrated from ancient Ghana down to the Atlantic coast eventually making their way over to the eastern Niger Delta. Linguistic calculations done by Kay Williamson place the Ogoni in the Niger Delta since before 15 BC, making them one of the oldest settlers in the eastern Niger Delta region. Radiocarbon dating taken from sites around Ogoniland and the neighboring communities oral traditions also support this claim. Traditionally, the Ogoni are agricultural, also known for livestock herding, fishing, salt and palm oil cultivation and trade.\n\nLike many peoples on the Guinea coast, the Ogoni have an internal political structure subject to community-by-community arrangement, including appointment of chiefs and community development bodies, some recognized by government and others not. They survived the period of the slave trade in relative isolation, and did not lose any of their members to enslavement. After Nigeria was colonized by the British in 1885, British soldiers arrived in Ogoni by 1901. Major resistance to their presence continued through 1914.\n\nThe Ogoni were integrated into a succession of economic systems at a pace that was extremely rapid and exacted a great toll from them. At the turn of the twentieth century, “the world to them did not extend beyond the next three or four villages,” but that soon changed. Ken Saro-Wiwa, the late president of MOSOP, described the transition this way: “if you then think that within the space of seventy years they were struck by the combined forces of modernity, colonialism, the money economy, indigenous colonialism and then the Nigerian Civil War, and that they had to adjust to these forces without adequate preparation or direction, you will appreciate the bafflement of the Ogoni people and the subsequent confusion engendered in the society.”\n\nThe Ogoni people have been victims of human rights violations for many years. In 1956, four years before Nigerian Independence, Royal Dutch/Shell, in collaboration with the British government, found a commercially viable oil field on the Niger Delta and began oil production in 1958. In a 15-year period from 1976 to 1991 there were reportedly 2,976 oil spills of about 2.1 million barrels of oil in Ogoniland, accounting for about 40% of the total oil spills of the Royal Dutch/Shell company worldwide. \n\nIn a 2011 assessment of over 200 locations in Ogoniland by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), they found that impacts of the 50 years of oil production in the region extended deeper than previously thought. Because of oil spills, oil flaring, and waste discharge, the alluvial soil of the Niger Delta is no longer viable for agriculture. Furthermore, in many areas that seemed to be unaffected, groundwater was found to have high levels of hydrocarbons or were contaminated with benzene, a carcinogen, at 900 levels above WHO guidelines. \n\nUNEP estimated that it could take up to 30 years to rehabilitate Ogoniland to its full potential and that the first five years of rehabilitation would require funding of about US$1 billion. In 2012, the Nigerian Minister of Petroleum Resources, Deizani Alison-Madueke, announced the establishment of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Restoration Project, which intends to follow the UNEP report suggestions of Ogoniland to prevent further degradation.\n\nIn 1990, under the leadership of activist and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Movement of the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) planned to take action against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the oil companies. In October 1990, MOSOP presented \"The Ogoni Bill of Rights\" to the government. The Bill hoped to gain political and economic autonomy for the Ogoni people, leaving them in control of the natural resources of Ogoniland protecting against further land degradation. The movement lost steam in 1994 after Saro-Wiwa and several other MOSOP leaders were executed by the Nigerian government\n\nIn 1993, following protests that were designed to stop contractors from laying a new pipeline for Shell, the Mobile Police raided the area to quell the unrest. In the chaos that followed, it has been alleged that 27 villages were raided, resulting in the death of 2,000 Ogoni people and displacement of 80,000.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2055420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055420", "title": "Irish showband", "text": "Irish showband\n\nThe Irish showband is a dance band format which was popular in Ireland mid-1950s to the mid-1980s, though some showbands have survived until the present day. The showband was based on the internationally popular six- or seven-piece dance band. The band's basic repertoire included standard dance numbers and covers of pop music hits. The versatile music ranged from rock and roll and country and western songs to traditional dixieland jazz and even Irish Céilí dance, Newfie stomps, folk music and waltzes. Key to a showband's popular success was the ability to perform songs currently in the record charts. Some bands also did comedy skits onstage.\n\nThe line-up usually featured a rhythm section of drums, lead, rhythm and bass guitars, a keyboard instrument, and a brass section of trumpet, saxophone and trombone. The band was fronted by one or two lead singers, who were assisted by other band members on backing vocals. Comedy routines were sometimes featured. The Irish showband, unlike the big band, played standing, and members would often step, dip and bop in the manner of Bill Haley & His Comets or a black soul band, which brought more energy to the performance. Initially, the bands' tours were limited to Irish venues. As the scene progressed, the more successful bands toured Irish clubs located in Britain the United States and Canada. Some later rock- and soul-oriented Showbands toured German nightclub circuits and a myriad of US Army base clubs in Europe.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s \"orchestras\" were popular in Ireland. These were dance bands usually with ten to fifteen musicians, and sometimes more. They wore dress suits and dickey bows. Often there would be a brass band based in the town where the orchestra came from and the orchestra members would have learned to play instruments in this brass band. They sat down and read sheet music from stands. Many of them took the format of American big bands from the 1940s, such as the Glenn Miller Orchestra, with instrumental music to the fore providing the backdrop to a long night's dancing which could be up to five hours long (e.g., 9 PM to 2 AM). Popular orchestras from the time were those of Maurice Mulcahy and Jimmy Wiley (both from Mitchelstown) Mick Delahunty (from Clonmel), Brose Walsh (from Castlebar), and Jack Ruane (from Ballina).\n\nAs singing and singers became more popular and instrumental tunes less popular, the orchestras downsized and morphed into showbands, dropping brass players, going from eight or ten brass down to three or four. The Maurice Mulcahy Orchestra went from fifteen members, five saxophones, four trumpets, one trombone, rhythm section and a singer in the early sixties to ten members in the early seventies, which included two singers but still held five brass, four saxophones and one trumpet, which would have been a large band for the seventies.\n\nDave Glover renamed his group to the Dave Glover Showband in 1955, pioneering the use of the word \"showband\"; he chose the name because he wanted to indicate that their act incorporated both music and skits.\n\nStrabane's Clipper Carlton are credited with being the first popular showband. Fronted by Fergie O'Hagan, they were originally a touring big band. They later became popular in Britain and on the U.S. and Canadian Irish club circuit. Brendan Bowyer, Tom Dunphy and the Royal Showband from Waterford toured professionally around 1958, and became a crowd-drawing success. They were managed by the promoter T.J. Byrne and were the first such band to have a record enter the Irish charts: \"Come Down From The Mountain, Katie Daly\", sung by Dunphy. Later, Brendan Bowyer had a hit with \"The Hucklebuck\", an American recording from the 1940s.\n\nThe Freshmen from Ballymena, Antrim, led by Billy Brown and Derek Dean, combined to produce harmonies on their covers of hits by The Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. Dickie Rock performed mainly big ballads. Starting out with Dublin's Melochords, he became a star with The Miami Showband, and later represented Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1967.\n\nAt its height in the mid-1960s, there were as many as 800 full and part-time bands travelling the country. The business as a whole employed many thousands of musicians, support staff and managers.\n\nOther popular bands in the sixties included those of Michael O'Callaghan (from Buttevant), The Dixies (from Cork), and Donie Collins (from Askeaton).\n\nA second wave of specialty bands emerged in the late sixties and early seventies. The 'second wave' bands were young proponents of a rock, blues and soul style. These bands included The Dreas, The Real McCoy, The Arrows and The Chessmen. They were most popular in urban areas, while Country and Western leaning bands were generally more popular in the rural areas of the country. Big Tom and the Mainliners and Larry Cunningham and the Mighty Avons were a huge summer marquee carnival dance draws alongside Margo, Philomena Begley and Brendan Shine.\n\nBy the mid-1970s the phenomenon had peaked, and was in decline. A number of factors contributed to their drop in popularity, including the advent of upscale discothèque, the opening of hotel music lounges and cabaret rooms (with alcohol licenses), and changing musical tastes.\n\nIn July 1975 members of the Ulster Volunteer Force killed three members of The Miami Showband, one of Ireland's biggest showbands, including lead singer Fran O'Toole, and wounded two others. The killings, which occurred as the band was returning from a show in Banbridge in Northern Ireland, became known as the Miami Showband killings. Cross-border band touring dropped significantly as a result, which hastened the decline of the showbands.\n\nOf the bands that did not break up entirely, many reduced their numbers and revamped into small pop rock or country music ensembles.\n\nThe city ballrooms were often purpose built and lavish. Most rural dance halls, on the other hand, were simple barn-like buildings at the edge of the town. Painted and lit in bright colours inside and out, they had fanciful romantic names such as \"Fairyland\", \"Dreamland\", \"Wonderland\" and \"Arcadia\". Dance halls in smaller towns and villages would host a dance once or twice a month. The fans often travelled fifty km from the surrounding countryside to see their favorite band. Some city ballrooms were lavish dance palaces from an earlier era. The Mecca in Belfast, Dublin's Town and Country Club (a Corinthian pillared ballroom in the Georgian era), Rotunda Rooms, the Metropole and the TV Club were prominent among the plusher venues.\n\nMost rural dance halls were roughly constructed in cheap materials by local entrepreneurs. Breeze block pebbled Irish garage architecture prevailed. They had benches along the side walls, usually women on one side of the hall and men on the other. The smell of Jeyes fluid from the crude rest rooms was a common smell of the time. A chain of venues in the midlands was operated by Albert Reynolds, who would later become Taoiseach of the Republic. Associated Ballrooms was owned by mining magnate Con Hynes. The Lucey brothers had large ballrooms in Cork. In the North East, the Adelphi ballroom, owned by Dee O'Kane and Jimmy Hamilton in Dundalk, attracted audiences from both sides of the border. Summer dancing was held in wet and windy marquees during parish carnivals throughout the country. \"Mineral Bars\" dispensed ham sandwiches, potato crisps, hot beverages and soft drinks.\n\nBallrooms and dance halls did not sell alcoholic beverages. Alcohol sales remained the prerogative of the local pub, who then began to build extensions onto pubs and operate their own disco or cabaret show.\n\nVarious internationally successful Irish singers and musicians began their careers in showbands, including Van Morrison, Henry McCullough, Mick Hanly, Rory Gallagher, Eric Bell, Eric Wrixon and Colm Wilkinson.\n\nThe 1987 Roddy Doyle novel \"The Commitments\" is about a contemporary group of unemployed Irish youths who start a soul band in the manner of the late-1960s Irish showbands. The novel spawned a popular 1991 film of the same name, which in turn led to a touring band, The Stars from the Commitments, and a 2013 musical, \"The Commitments\".\n\nThe 2005 Irish TV movie \"Showbands\" and its 2006 sequel, \"Showbands II\", both starred Liam Cunningham as the manager of a struggling Irish showband in the mid-1960s.\n\nIn 2010, Ireland's postal service, An Post, issued a set of four commemorative stamps depicting four of Ireland's biggest showbands: The Drifters, The Freshmen, The Miami Showband and The Royal Showband. An An Post spokesman said that the showbands \"rocked Irish society from its postwar depression\".\n\nIn March 2019, Ardal O'Hanlon presented a BBC Four documentary about the showband phenomenon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055423", "title": "Rōnin (DC Comics)", "text": "Rōnin (DC Comics)\n\nRonin (formally written as Rōnin) is an American comic book limited series published between 1983 and 1984, by DC Comics. The series was written and drawn by Frank Miller with artwork painted by Lynn Varley. It takes place in a dystopic near-future New York City in which a ronin is reincarnated. The six-issue work shows some of the strongest influences of manga and bande dessinée on Miller's style, both in the artwork and narrative style.\n\nThe ideas for \"Ronin\" came together while Miller was doing extensive research into kung fu movies, martial arts, samurai comic books and samurai ethics for his work on \"Daredevil\". He remarked that \"The aspect of the samurai that intrigues me most is the ronin, the masterless samurai, the fallen warrior. ... This entire project comes from my feelings that we, modern men, are ronin. We're kind of cut loose. I don't get the feeling from the people I know, the people I see on the street, that they have something greater than themselves to believe in. Patriotism, religion, whatever — they've all lost their meaning for us\".\n\n\"Ronin\" was in part inspired by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima's manga series \"Kozure Ōkami\". (Though \"Kozure Ōkami\" would receive an English localization several years later as \"Lone Wolf and Cub\", at the time Miller could not read the text and had to rely on the artwork for his understanding of the story.) According to former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, \"Ronin\" was originally slated to be released as part of Marvel's Marvel Graphic Novel series. Ultimately, however, Miller was persuaded by publisher Jenette Kahn that DC Comics would give him as much freedom as he desired for the series, and the first issue of \"Ronin\" was published by that company in 1983.\n\nDespite being both written and drawn by Miller, \"Ronin\" was created using the full script method; a full panel-by-panel script was written for each issue before any of it was drawn, though in some cases Miller made revisions to the story after he began drawing. For example, Miller has said that when he began drawing \"Ronin\" #1, \"There was no explosion, no demon shot across the city. I'd planned a brief skirmish between the demon and the ronin, from which Virgo rescued the ronin. But, as I was working on the sequence, I realized that I had been building and building tension across the story and hadn't done anything to release it. The feeling of the story ... was that it needed something \"big\" to happen there, something to release the tension\". In part to make room for this additional scene, Miller eliminated an extended sequence involving the Ronin and the woman and child he rescues.\n\nLike an earlier DC maxi-series, \"Camelot 3000\", \"Ronin\" was printed on a higher quality paper stock. Each issue contained 48 pages of story and no advertisements.\n\nIn feudal Japan, a young, nameless samurai has sworn to protect his master, Lord Ozaki, from assassins. Ozaki is assassinated at night by a demon called Agat in the guise of a geisha, in an act of revenge for Ozaki stealing his sword. The sword is powered by blood — if it can be fueled by the blood of an innocent, the sword will become powerful enough to destroy Agat. Ozaki has hidden the sword, so Agat cannot find it. The young samurai prepares to perform seppuku at his master's graveside. The spirit of Ozaki appears before him and demands that he find the sword and keep it from Agat until his skills are great enough to destroy the demon lord. The young samurai becomes a rōnin, wandering the countryside for many years. He comes to Agat's castle, and fights his way inside. Since the sword has never killed an innocent, it is not powerful enough to destroy Agat, so when Agat approaches him from behind, the ronin thrusts the sword through his own abdomen, impaling Agat. As Agat dies, he curses the ronin, and both their souls are trapped inside the sword until someone releases them.\n\nEight centuries later, social and economic collapse has left New York a lawless wasteland, populated by squatters, factions, and mutants. In the heart of the city is the Aquarius Complex, the headquarters of the Aquarius Corporation. The Aquarius Corporation is an idealistic company founded by three people: Peter McKenna, inventor of biocircuitry, his wife, Casey McKenna, Aquarius' head of security, and Mr. Taggart, who funded and controls Aquarius. The company is successful developing and marketing biocircuitry as a means of saving a world on the brink of war. Biocircuitry is a new model of plastics-based electronics, capable of self-organization and self-repair under the direction of Virgo, the artificial intelligence at the heart of the Aquarius Complex.\n\nAquarius's ward, Billy Challas, was born without any limbs due to a genetic defect and has telekinetic powers. Virgo works with him to develop his psionic abilities and Billy tests cutting-edge prosthetic limbs for Aquarius. Billy has been having vivid dreams of the story of Ozaki, the ronin, and Agat. Billy and Virgo are confused by the detail and historical accuracy of the dream since his education had never covered feudal Japan. \n\nBack at Aquarius, Virgo explains what has occurred to Casey McKenna, who assumes Virgo's logic units have been affected, but begins an investigation anyway. Agat infiltrates the complex, where he murders Taggart and assumes his form. In this guise, Agat begins negotiating a weapons deal with the Japan-based Sawa Corporation. Peter McKenna is outraged; he had created the technology under the agreement that it would be for non-violent purposes only. He confronts Taggart and realizes that he's an impostor. He informs Virgo, who is not only unshaken by this revelation, but immediately informs Taggart, forming a pact with him. Peter infiltrates Virgo's memory bank and forces her to show him what happened to Taggart. Even with the video replay, Peter refuses to believe the story and accuses Virgo of killing Taggart. He is kidnapped and held prisoner by Agat.\n\nHead, an aging hippie who realizes that the ronin is his ticket to security, tells the ronin that he'll 'manage' him and take care of him; the ronin passively acquiesces. Head plans to sell the ronin as \"The Elvis of Violence\", and makes deals with the heads of both the Nazi and Black factions to kill the other faction's leader in exchange for rice, beer, sterno, and a place to sleep.\n\nCasey McKenna gets authorization to pursue and retrieve the ronin, understanding from Virgo that Billy Challas has somehow been transformed into a killer, and that the absence of effective law enforcement means that capturing him is Aquarius' responsibility. The three man team who finds the ronin, however, is killed without hesitation. Convinced of Virgo's story, Casey seeks permission to kill the ronin. Taggart denies this when Virgo informs him that the ronin is, in fact, Billy, complete with telekinetic power and, as such, might be useful in cybernetics. Casey finds the ronin dealing with the Nazi and Black factions and, despite her orders, attempts to kill him. Casey is knocked unconscious by the two factions before she can accomplish this and is thrown into a pit. The ronin kills both faction leaders, discards Head, and goes to rescue Casey.\n\nThe pit leads into sewers infested with cannibals, who swarm and kidnap Casey and the ronin. The ronin breaks free and slaughters the cannibals. Casey is surprised to find herself falling in love with the ronin. It snows shortly thereafter, for the first time in five years, and the ronin speaks English out of the blue. Casey and the ronin sleep together in the snow.\n\nPeter, bound and gagged, is met by therapist Sandy. Peter convinces Sandy to free him and they try to make sense of all that has occurred. Peter concludes that Virgo kept the extent of Billy's powers a secret in order to exploit them, and that Billy created the ronin based around the television programs he loved so much as a kid, using his powers to create arms and legs built for himself and control Casey. Sandy, hearing this, thinks Peter is insane, and leaves him alone with Virgo.\n\nRobots sent by Taggart attack the ronin and Casey, removing the ronin's mechanical arms and legs. Virgo, controlling the robots, starts a mental attack on the ronin, bringing forward Billy's repressed memory of murdering a local bully. Billy, enraged, regains his limbs, but a horde of flying robots subdue him and blast the subway tunnel where Casey had been trying to make her escape. Trapped, the ronin mentally reaches out to Casey, who regains consciousness within the rubble and kills a robot. Casey breaks into Aquarius, which by this point has engulfed the entire city. The ronin causes a blackout that allows Casey to escape the guards and find Peter. Virgo forces Agat to restrain himself, and address the workers about the blackout. Virgo confronts Billy mentally. Virgo soothes Billy and convinces him to stop helping Casey.\n\nCasey, with the help of Learnid and Sandy, whom Learnid convinces of Peter's sanity, finds Peter. A physical wreck, Peter informs Casey that Billy is being manipulated by Virgo into turning fantasy into reality. A Virgo robot attacks and kills Peter. Reinvigorated by Casey's sadness, Billy begins questioning Virgo. When Casey is attacked by another robot, Billy is enraged and lashes out, destroying it. Virgo verbally castigates Billy, threatening to send him away (as his mother did after she saw him murder the bully) if he doesn't stop. Billy backs down.\n\nTaggart, trying to calm the workers, is confronted by Learnid who accuses him of having been corrupted. Before Taggart can attack, Virgo orders him away, stating a life-threatening hazard has occurred. Learnid notes that regulations give him authority in such situations to evacuate non-essential personnel and forces Virgo to carry out the order.\n\nCasey runs into Peter, now a deformed half-man/half-machine, who attacks her. Peter explains that Billy's powers gave Virgo a consciousness and Virgo wanted more. In order to increase his power, while keeping him under control, she manipulated him into creating the ronin, thereby releasing his power, but trapping him in fantasy. Virgo wants to make biocircuitry the new dominant life form on Earth. Casey kills Peter and tells Virgo to take her to the ronin. Once near him, she is transported back into fantasy, and keeps playing along. Kissing the ronin, they are confronted by Agat. Casey turns to confront him but rather than taking out her sword, she shoots him in the head. Agat's wiring explodes, revealing him to be a robot.\n\nSensing danger, Virgo tries in vain to talk Casey out of acting, to no avail. Casey frees the ronin, then humiliates him, as a woman had avenged his master where he had failed. Casey then gives him a sword to commit seppuku while acting as his second. As the ronin guts himself, Billy cries in agony. Virgo tries to scold him to take control but Billy can't control himself, blaming Virgo for making him feel worthless. The ronin shoves the sword into his heart, Casey decapitates him, and Billy unleashes a telekinetic blast which destroys Aquarius, and by extension, New York. The only ones left standing are Casey and the ronin.\n\nThe series has been collected into a single volume:\n\n\nIn 1998, Darren Aronofsky inked a deal with New Line Cinema for a film adaptation of the graphic novel.\nIn 2007, Gianni Nunnari, producer of \"300\", announced he would be producing and Sylvain White, director of \"Stomp the Yard\", directing the \"Ronin\" film adaptation.\n\nIn April 2014 Syfy announced that they are adapting \"Ronin\" into a miniseries.\n\nAnimation director Genndy Tartakovsky has stated that \"Ronin\" was one of the major influences on his animated TV series \"Samurai Jack\", with Miller's \"300\" also inspiring an episode.\n\n\"Ronin\" was also one of the inspirations behind the creation of \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and Wes Craig's art for \"Deadly Class\" from Image Comics.\n"}

Modern room correction systems produce substantial improvements in the time domain and frequency domain response of the sound reproduction system.\n\nThe use of analog filters, such as equalizers, to normalize the frequency response of a playback system has a long history; however, analog filters are very limited in their ability to correct the distortion found in many rooms. Although digital implementations of the equalizers have been available for some time, digital room correction is usually used to refer to the construction of filters which attempt to invert the impulse response of the room and playback system, at least in part. Digital correction systems are able to use acausal filters, and are able to operate with optimal time resolution, optimal frequency resolution, or any desired compromise along the Gabor limit. Digital room correction is a fairly new area of study which has only recently been made possible by the computational power of modern CPUs and DSPs.\n\nThe configuration of a digital room correction system begins with measuring the impulse response of the room at the listening location for each of the loudspeakers. Then, computer software is used to compute a FIR filter, which reverses the effects of the room and linear distortion in the loudspeakers. Finally, the calculated filter is loaded into a computer or other room correction device which applies the filter in real time. Because most room correction filters are acausal, there is some delay. Most DRC systems allow the operator to control the added delay through configurable parameters.\n\nDRC systems are not normally used to create a perfect inversion of the room's response because a perfect correction would only be valid at the location where it was measured: a few millimeters away the arrival times from various reflections will differ and the inversion will be imperfect. The imperfectly corrected signal may end up sounding worse than the uncorrected signal because the acausal filters used in digital room correction may cause pre-echo. Room correction filter calculation systems instead favor a robust approach, and employ sophisticated processing to attempt to produce an inverse filter which will work over a usably large volume, and which avoid producing bad-sounding artifacts outside of that volume, at the expense of peak accuracy at the measurement location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2055454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055454", "title": "Cuban exile", "text": "Cuban exile\n\nThe term Cuban exile refers to exodus of Cubans from the island of Cuba after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. The first wave occurred directly after the revolution, followed by the Freedom Flights from 1965 to 1973. This was followed by the 1980 Mariel boatlift and after 1994 the flight of balseros emigrating by raft.\n\nThe majority of the 1,172,899 current Cuban exiles living in the United States live in Florida (917,033 in 2014), mainly in Miami-Dade County, where more than a third of the population is Cuban. Other exiles have relocated to form substantial Cuban communities in New York City (16,416), Louisville, KY (6,662), Houston, TX (6,233), Los Angeles (6,056), Union City, NJ (4,970) and others.\n\nBefore the post-revolution exile around 50,000 Cuban Americans already resided in the United States. Immediately after the 1959 Cuban Revolution around 200,000 Cubans came to South Florida. Of these emigrants many were collaborators in the recently toppled Batista regime, of the middle or upper class, and of European descent. Many emigrants believed their exile was temporary since Fidel Castro would soon be toppled. Travel between the United States and Cuba was not heavily restricted even in the wake of the recent revolution. In 1960 Dwight D. Eisenhower established the Cuban Refugee Emergency Center which offered public services to Cuban emigrants. Many immigration restrictions were specifically waived for Cubans entering the United States.\n\nMany of these original Cuban exiles were involved in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion which failed to topple Fidel Castro. After the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 the Cuban government would restrict air traffic to the island, ending the first major wave of emigration.\n\nTo destabilize the communist dictatorship, the CIA and Cubans dissidents began warning of a project by the castrist government, to remove the parents' custody of their children to indoctrinate them. Between November 1960 and October 1962, over 14,000 children were sent to the U.S. by their parents in Operation Peter Pan. These children were taken under the care of the Catholic Church and placed in foster homes throughout the U.S until they could be reunited with their parents. Their parents sent them into the U.S in order to keep them from communist indoctrination, with many boys being sent to avoid getting drafted into the Cuban armed forces, and girls being put into the greatly politized Alphabetization Campaign.\n\nOn September 28, 1965, Fidel Castro announced that Cubans wishing to emigrate could do so beginning 10 October from the Cuban port of Camarioca. The administration of U.S. President Johnson tried to control the numbers it would admit to the U.S. and set some parameters for their qualifications, preferring those claiming political persecution and those with family members in the U.S. In negotiations with the Cuban government it set a target of 3,000 to 4,000 people to be transported by air. Despite those diplomatic discussions, Cuban Americans brought small leisure boats from the United States to Camarioca. In the resulting Camarioca boatlift, about 160 boats transported about 5,000 refugees to Key West for immigration processing by U.S. officials. The Johnson administration made only modest efforts to enforce restrictions on this boat traffic. Castro closed the port with little notice on November 15, stranding thousands. On November 6, the Cuban and U.S. governments agreed on the details on an emigration airlift based on family reunification and without reference to those the U.S. characterized as political prisoners and whom the Cubans termed counter-revolutionaries. To deal with the crowds at Camarioca, the U.S. added a maritime component to the airborne evacuation. Both forms of transport started operating on December 1.\n\nFrom December 1965 to early 1973, under the Johnson and Nixon administrations, twice daily \"Freedom Flights\" (Vuelos de la Libertad) transported émigrés from Varadero Beach to Miami. The longest airlift of political refugees, it transported 265,297 Cubans to the United States with the help of religious and volunteer agencies. Flights were limited to immediate relatives and Cubans already in the United States with a waiting period anywhere from one to two years. \n\nMany who came through Camarioca and the Freedom Flights were much more racially diverse, of lower economic standing, and of more women compared to earlier emigration waves. This is mainly due to Castro's restriction not allowing skilled laborers to leave the country.\n\nDuring the Carter administration various actions were taken to better relations between the United States and Cuba. In 1978 the first commercial flight in sixten years would fly from Miami to Havana. The Cuban government would also allow the visit the Antonio Maceo Brigade, the first visit of Cuban exiles to the island. Many Cuban exile organizations would protest the warming of relations with Cuba while some other organizations supported increased diplomacy.\n\nBetween April 26 and October 1, 1980, during the Carter administration, probably one of the most significant waves of exiles occurred during what became known as the Mariel Boatlift. The mass \"boatlift\" occurred after a number of Cubans drove a bus through the gates of the Havana Peruvian Embassy and requested asylum. One embassy guard died as a result of friendly fire when another guard machine gunned the incoming bus and hit the first one accidentally. When the Peruvian ambassador refused to return the exiled citizens to the authorities, Castro removed the Cuban guards from the embassy, basically opening the door to the 4,000 plus asylum seekers that came into the embassy within the next few days. Reacting to this sudden exodus, Castro stated, \"Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can do so\" and declared that those who were leaving the country were the \"escoria\" (scum).\n\nThis resulted in an even larger exodus through the port of Mariel, where an improvised flotilla of Cuban exiles from Miami in small pleasure boats and commercial shrimping vessels brought Cuban citizens who wished to leave the island. Within weeks, 125,000 Cubans reached the United States despite Coast Guard attempts to prevent boats from leaving U.S. waters for Cuba. As the exodus became international news and an embarrassment for the Cuban government, Castro emptied his hospitals and had prison inmates rounded up as \"social undesirables\", and included them among the other refugees. The Cuban Communist Party staged meetings at the homes of those known to be leaving the country. People were intimidated by these \"repudiation meetings\" (mitines de repudio), where the participants screamed obscenities and defiled the facades of the homes, throwing eggs and garbage, for hours. Labeled as \"traitors to the revolution\" those who declared their wish to leave became the targeted victims of the attacks, their rationing cards were taken from them, their jobs were terminated, or they were expelled from schools or universities. Towards the end of the crisis, the repudiation meetings were ended. The scale of the exodus created political difficulties for the Cuban government, and an agreement was reached to end the boatlift after several months. Out of more than 125,000 refugees, a number from as low as 7,500 to as high as 40,000 were believed to have criminal records in Cuba, though many of their crimes would not qualify as crimes under U.S. law. Some 1,774 of the refugees were classified as serious or violent criminals under U.S. law and denied citizenship on that basis. The majority of refugees were young adult males, 20 to 34 years of age, from the working class: skilled craftsmen, semi-skilled tradesmen, and unskilled laborers.\n\nIn response the aftermath of the Mariel Boatlift, the City of Miami formed the East Little Havana Task Force in 1983. Task Force members were appointed by the Miami City Commission and it was chaired by urban planner and Cuban community leader Jesus Permuy. It was tasked with studying the social and economic effects of the boatlift, particularly in Little Havana, which was an epicenter of the migration. The Task Force adjourned a year later and submitted its findings and official recommendations, called \"The East Little Havana Redevelopment Plan\", to the Miami City Commission and Mayor's Office in 1984. Also in 1984, the United States and Cuba negotiated an agreement to resume normal immigration and to return to Cuba those persons who had arrived during the boatlift who were \"excludable\" under U.S. law.\n\nDuring the past years, exile waves have consisted of \"balseros\", who travel in homemade rafts. On 18 August 1994, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said in a press release:\n\nPresident Clinton, trying to stem the flow of Cuban rafters, pressed a dozen Latin American governments to provide internment camps that officials hoped would prove more attractive to refugees than the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Although the refugees at Guantanamo were held behind barbed wire, to many, the base was less forbidding than a foreign internment camp.\n\nAs a result of bilateral migration accords between the two governments, in September 1994 and May 1995, the status quo of U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants was altered significantly. The U.S. granted Cuba an annual minimum of 20,000 legal immigrant visas and, at the same time, determined that Cubans picked up at sea would be sent home just as any other group of illegal immigrants. President Clinton's agreement with Cuba resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33,000 Cubans then at Guantanamo. This new agreement had two new points. The United States agreed to take most of the Cubans detained at Guantanamo through the humanitarian parole provision. Cuba agreed to credit some of these admissions toward the minimum quota of 20,000 migrants from Cuba, with 5,000 charged annually over the years. Secondly, rather than placing Cubans intercepted at sea in a camp, the United States began sending them back to Cuba. Both governments promised to follow international agreements to ensure that no action would be taken against the people returned to Cuba.\n\nAs a result of these migration agreements and interdiction policy, a \"wet foot/dry foot\" practice toward Cuban immigrants has developed. Those who do not reach dry land are returned to Cuba unless they fear persecution there, but only those who meet the definition of asylum refugee are accepted for eventual resettlement in a third country. Those Cuban rafters who do reach land are inspected by Department of Homeland Security and usually are allowed to stay in the United States. From May 1995 through July 2003, about 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in eleven different countries, including Spain, Venezuela, Australia, and Nicaragua. Since March 2003 the State Department has not been allowed to monitor the treatment of the immigrants returned to Cuba. The wet foot/dry foot was abruptly ended by President Obama days before he ended his second term in 2017, which sparked controversy for the Cuban Exile community \n\nPresident Barack Obama announced he would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014. After negotiations with the Cuban government, the Obama administration agreed to end the Wet feet, dry feet policy and Cuba agreed to give reparations to Cuban nationals. Later President Donald Trump would prioritize deporting any immigrant who entered the U.S. illegally including Cubans. It became almost impossible for Cubans to legally apply for visas to the U.S. after the U.S. embassy in Havana was closed after sonic attacks against the facility.\n\nActs have occurred in U.S. regions and at least sixteen other countries, carried out by groups such as Alpha 66, Omega 7, and the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations. A series of bombings in Miami in the mid-1970s led to hearings before a U.S. Subcommittee to investigate internal security. Notable cases of violence targeting individuals include that of Luciano Nieves, who was murdered after advocating peaceful coexistence with Cuba, and WQBA-AM news director Emilio Milian who survived a car bomb but lost his legs after he publicly condemned Cuban exile violence. In 1992 Human Rights Watch released a report stating that hard-line Miami exiles have created an environment in which \"moderation can be a dangerous position.\"\n\nIn November 2006, U.S. Congressional auditors accused the development agency USAID of failing properly to administer its program to promote democracy in Cuba. They said that USAID had channeled tens of millions of dollars through exile groups in Miami, which were sometimes wasteful or kept questionable accounts. The report said the organizations had sent items such as chocolate and cashmere jerseys to Cuba. Their report concluded that 30% of the exile groups who received USAID grants showed questionable expenditures.\n\n\nVarious historical analysts and social critics have made analyses of the events of the Cuban exile.\n\nSocial researcher Jorge Duany has argued that the myth of the \"Golden exiles\" or the idea that most Cuban exiles are wealthy, well educated, and highly skilled unlike other immigrant populations, is incorrect. He states that many Cuban exiles face cultural and economic challenges resettling in the United States similar to many other American immigrant communities. He also states that as the Cuban exile progressed since 1959 more and more economically disenfranchised Cubans became part of the emigrant waves. These lower class Cuban exiles became noticeable in the Freedom Flights and especially so in the Mariel boatlift and balseros afterwards.\n\nMaria Torres wrote in the Chicago Tribune that contrary to the Golden exile myth Cubans are not entirely racially white but from various racial backgrounds and at the time the article was written in 1986, Cuban American families statistically earned less money than the average white family.\n\nAccording to authors John Scanlan and Gilburt Loescher, United States acceptance of Cuban emigrants after the 1959 Cuban Revolution was done in hopes they could help the United States forcibly remove the Fidel Castro government from Cuba. The acceptance of Cuban emigrants during the Freedom Flights was done in hopes of weakening the Cuban economy by draining it of workers. The United States also was generally able to paint a negative picture of Cuba by participating in the mass emigration of many who disliked Cuba and wished to flee the island. The Department of State painted Cuban emigrants in the 1960s as freedom seeking refugees. By the Mariel boatlift the United States had lost its total aggressive foreign policy towards Cuba and instead viewed the island as a nuisance rather than a security threat. The Mariel boatlift was soon canceled after it was initiated and received little public American support. Fidel Castro benefited from the exile because he was able to remove disloyalty by directly removing disloyal citizens from Cuba.\n\nSocial analyst Kelly M. Greenhill argues that the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis was in part engineered by the Cuban government to push social problems out of Cuba and threaten the creation of a humanitarian crisis for the United States. This threat would stimulate fears of Cuban immigrants in the United States as was seen previously during the Mariel boatlift and would be able to change United States policy towards Cuba in Cuba's favor.\n\n\n\n"}

Tate High School is a secondary school in Cantonment, Florida, United States. The school is part of the Escambia County School District.\n\nTate High School was founded in 1878 by James Madison Tate Sr., a Civil War veteran, minister and former lawyer. The school was originally called Roberts High School and was one of the first high schools established in Escambia County. The original school building was one room with a sawdust floor; students sat on wooden benches. Initially, Tate taught all of the grades himself. Tate taught at Roberts High until 1913, when he retired.\n\nIn 1917, the James Madison Tate Sr. Agricultural School was completed. The school was a two-story brick building with eight classrooms. Establishment of the agricultural school advanced the agricultural programs already in place at the original Roberts High.\n\nIn 1927, O.A. Strange became principal of Tate High School. During his 24-year tenure as head of the school, 10 buildings were added to the campus and the school transformed from a small rural school to a modern high school.\n\nDuring the early days of Tate High, there was no football equipment, so the school's main sports were basketball and baseball. Tate's baseball team has won seven state championships since 1960. One of the school's most accomplished baseball players, Don Sutton, went on to major league fame with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe football team won the 4A state championship in 1980 under coach Carl Madison.\n\nThe Tate softball team won the Florida Class 7A state championship in 2015 lead by pitcher Tori Perkins current player for the University of West Florida. \n\nTate's marching band, the Showband of the South, won the first official Bands of America Grand National Championship, in 1980.\n\nTate is also known for its drumline which has competed in annual world championship competitions in Dayton, Ohio. The school's colorguard is known as the \"Tate Chaparrals.\" In 1989, the colorguard competed in the WGI Scholastic World Class Competition, winning first place.\n\nThe Tate High School FFA chapter was founded in 1929.\n\n"}
{"id": "2055457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055457", "title": "Football boot", "text": "Football boot\n\nFootball boots, called cleats or soccer shoes in North America, are an item of footwear worn when playing football. Those designed for grass pitches have studs on the outsole to aid grip. From simple and humble beginnings football boots have come a long way and today find themselves subject to much research, development, sponsorship and marketing at the heart of a multi-national global industry. Modern \"boots\" are not truly boots in that they do not cover the ankle - like most other types of specialist sports footwear, their basic design and appearance has converged with that of sneakers since the 1960s.\n\n1800s: During the 19th century football became extremely popular in Britain. People who played would wear their heavy and hard work boots to play. These were the first ever boots with the steel toe cap at the front, long laces and ankle support. These boots also had metal studs or tacks put in the sole the bottom so the players would have more stability on the pitch. In the later part of the 19th century the first ever football-specific boot was designed, made of thick and heavy leather which ran right to the ankle for increased protection; the first boot weighed and would double in weight when it was wet.\n\n1900–1940: During this period the style of football boots stayed very basic. They remained so during the inter-war years, despite many famous football boot producers, such as Gola, Hummel and Valsport becoming evermore popular.\n\n1940–1960: After the Second World War, the designs of the football boot changed dramatically. The South Americans designed a lighter and more flexible boot. This design was focused on increasing good control and better kicking power rather than a more protective boot. In 1954 Adi Dassler introduced screw-in studs which gave the German team a tangible advantage during a rain-lashed World Cup that year. That Dassler was the first to come up with screw-in studs is disputed by his older brother, Rudolf Dassler, founder of Puma.\n\n1960s: In the 1960s many football boots were designed with a lower cut. These enabled the best players in Europe and South America to move faster and change direction quicker. Mitre, Joma and Asics joined the fray.\n\n1970s: The 1970s and the 1980s saw many large advances and changes in the football boot design. These included lighter boots and a variety of colours. Boot sponsorship also became more widespread. Adidas was the market leader in this period. At the end of the decade, in 1979, it cemented its status by releasing what has gone on to become the best selling boot of all time, the Copa Mundial. During this time period, some of the most common types of natural leather came into production: kangaroo leather, calfskin and full-grain/cow leather. Diadora entered the market in this decade.\n\n1980s: Umbro, Lotto and Kelme joined the market in this decade.\n\n1990–2000s: New types of sole were introduced to increase the balance of the player. The Adidas Predator, designed by Australian Craig Johnston in the late 1980s, was released in 1994 and enjoyed instant success. In the first decade of the 21st century laser technology was introduced to produce the first fully customised football boot in 2006.\n\n2010s: In the era of the modern game that sees the tempo of matches becoming faster and players more technically inclined, manufacturers introduce new advances in technology including lighter footwear made from alternative materials.\n\nDepending on the type of surface, kind of sport and even the wearer's position or role in the game, different cuts of boot and particularly stud arrangements are available. For hard pitches, amateur participants may wear a sneaker shoe or a plastic-stud boot (known as a \"moulded sole\"); in most sports and positions this is adequate, although on a well-grassed or sodden field, screw-in studs are recommended for more grip; these may be metal, rubber or plastic. When playing on this kind of pitch, some players favor using a boot with screw-in studs in their non-dominant (supporting) foot to provide grip, and a boot with short rubber or plastic studs in the dominant (kicking/passing) foot to provide accuracy.\n\nFor indoor football, indoor boots are used. These come with rubber soles, meant to maximize grip on the floor. Some are built on the design of firm-ground football boots, and some are specifically designed for the indoor game. For football on turf or artificial grass, some players wear regular firm ground football boots. But wearing regular football boots on turf greatly reduces the life of the boot, so companies such as Nike have developed football boots for artificial grass (AG).\n\nFor rugby union, the screw-in stud is preferred, especially in the positions of prop, hooker, and lock, where more grip is required for contested scrums. These screw-in studs have to be of a maximum length of 21 mm. These boots are often heavier than appropriate for other types of football. One of the more obvious differences between association football and rugby boots is the formation of the studs - rugby boots typically have no fewer than nine studs whilst those worn for soccer can have a minimum of six. Also, some rugby boots tend to have a high cut around the ankles but this type is becoming less popular, especially at elite level. There are several types of rugby boot, meant for players in different positions.\n\nScrew-in studs have been banned in some Australian rules football leagues since the 1990s due to the frequency of severe injuries to players as a result of contact with the metal. In football, referees must now check all boots prior to kick off to check for damage to studs, to prevent injury. Before this time, preference between the screw-in stud was based primarily on weather conditions.\n\nMore recently, moulded soles with specially designed boots known as \"blades\" have moulded soles facing in multiple directions, theoretically to maximise grip and minimise ankle injury. Recently, however, \"bladed\" football boots have faced criticism from some UK sporting bodies for causing potentially serious injuries to players. English football club Manchester United have even banned their players from wearing boots with bladed studs after players like Wayne Rooney and David Beckham suffered repeated metatarsal injuries.\n\nOriginally, football boots were available only in black, but in more recent years have become available in various colours such as blue, green, red, white, yellow, silver, gold and even pink. Big name companies such as Nike, Adidas, Puma and the like have made an impact on the market with record sales. Nike's flagship shoes are the Hypervenoms, Magistas, Tiempos and The Nike Mercurial worn by Cristiano Ronaldo and others. German company Adidas are responsible for the Predator range worn by David Beckham, Gary Neville, and Steven Gerrard, as well as the long-surviving Copa Mundial. The entire German national side wore Adidas boots during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Another German firm Puma flagship shoes are the Kings, Evospeed, Evopower and Evotouch worn by Sergio Agüero, Marco Reus, Cesc Fàbregas and Antoine Griezmann.\nThe Puma King soccer cleat have been worn by legendary players such as Pelé, Eusébio, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona.\n\nIn recent times, the most successful companies are Nike and Adidas, and their products enjoy great popularity among professional footballers; among Nike's endorsers are two-time FIFA World Player of the Year Ronaldinho, aforementioned duo Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, striker Ronaldo, Wesley Sneijder, Zlatan Ibrahimović, and other popular players. Adidas, which has been providing football boots with screw-in studs to the German national side since the 1954 FIFA World Cup, have made their impact on the modern market by signing big name players as endorsers: players such as David Beckham, former France captain Zinedine Zidane, Frank Lampard, six-time world player of the year Lionel Messi, David Villa, Steven Gerrard and other successful players. \n\nMany players use personalisation around the world to improve the look of their boots and to make them easily identifiable in the club dressing room. It is now very common to have football boots fully personalised with either a name, initials, number or club logo.\nMany retailers offer various options and colours to personalise football boots by using the embroidery machinery.\n\n"}

Under licence from the HKMA, three commercial banks issue their own banknotes for general circulation in the region. Notes are also issued by the HKMA itself.\n\nIn most countries of the world the issue of banknotes is handled exclusively by a single central bank or government. The arrangements in Hong Kong are unusual but not unique, as a comparable system is used in the United Kingdom where seven commercial banks issue banknotes (three in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland) and Macau where two banks issue banknotes.\n\nHong Kong banknotes in everyday circulation are issued in denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1,000.\n\nThe total value of banknotes in circulation in Hong Kong can be found in the HKMA Monthly Statistical Bulletin and the HKMA Annual Report.\n\nIn the 1860s the Oriental Bank Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) began issuing notes. Denominations issued in the 1860s and 1870s included 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 dollars. These notes were not accepted by the Treasury for payment of government dues and taxes, although they were accepted for use by merchants. 25-dollar notes did not survive beyond the end of the 19th century, whilst the 1-dollar notes (issued only by the HSBC) were issued until 1935.\n\nUnder the Currency Ordinance of 1935, banknotes in denominations of 5 dollars and above issued by the three authorised local banks (the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) were all declared legal tender. The government took over production of 1-dollar notes. In 1941, the government introduced notes for 1, 5 and 10 cents due to the difficulty of transporting coins to Hong Kong caused by the Second World War (a shipment of 1941 1-cent coins was sunk, making this unissued coin very rare). Just before the Japanese occupation, an emergency issue of 1-dollar notes was made consisting of overprinted Bank of China 5-yuan notes.\n\nIn 1945, paper money production resumed essentially unaltered from before the war, with the government issuing notes of 1, 5 and 10 cents and 1 dollar, and the three banks issuing notes of 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 dollars. 1-dollar notes were replaced by coins in 1960, with only the 1-cent note issued by the government after 1965.\n\nIn 1975, the 5-dollar notes were replaced by a coin, whilst 1,000-dollar notes were introduced in 1977. The Mercantile Bank was absorbed by HSBC in 1978 and ceased issuing notes. In 1985, 20-dollar notes were introduced, whilst, in 1993, a 10-dollar coin was introduced and the banks stopped issuing 10-dollar notes. In 1994, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), gave authority to the Bank of China to issue notes.\n\nThe 1-cent note issued by the Government was demonetised and ceased to be legal tender on 1 October 1995.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2002 an attempt was made to replace privately issued 10-dollar notes with coins issued by the government. In response to public demand for the continuation of a $10 note, the HKMA issued its own ten-dollar notes. Ten-dollar banknotes are currently the only denomination issued by the HKMA, having acquired the note printing plant at Tai Po from the De La Rue Group of the UK on behalf of the Government.\n\nLeading to the incorporation of Standard Chartered (Hong Kong) on 1 July 2004, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong amended Legal Tender Notes Issue Ordinance. The amendment replaced Standard Chartered Bank with its newly incorporated subsidiary - Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd - as one of the note-issuing banks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe older (green) 10-dollar banknotes previously issued by two commercial banks are still circulating and remain legal tender, although they are being phased out since September 2005. These are popular for lai see and are noticeably scarce in the run up to Chinese New Year.\n\nA commemorative polymer ten-dollar note was issued in July 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. The new note will circulate along with other 10-dollar issues for a trial period of two years, though the initial batch released was largely snapped up by collectors.\n\nThe Government, through the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, authorises three commercial banks to issue currency notes in Hong Kong:\n\n\nAuthorisation is accompanied by a set of terms and conditions agreed on between the Government and the three note-issuing banks. In return for their right to issue notes and to provide backing for these notes, the three banks are legally required to hold non-interest bearing Certificates of Indebtedness (CI) issued by the Exchange Fund.\n\nBanknotes are issued by the three banks, or redeemed, against payment to, or from, the Government Exchange Fund in US dollars, at a specified rate of US$1 to HK$7.80 under the Linked Exchange Rate system.\n\nBanknotes issued by the three commercial banks are printed in Hong Kong by Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nIn April 1996, the HKMA acquired the note printing plant at Tai Po from the De La Rue Group of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Government. The plant has been operating under the name of HKNPL since then. The acquisition of the plant enables the Government, through the HKMA, to be directly involved in the production of Hong Kong currency notes, which is in line with the responsibilities conferred upon the Government under the Legal Tender Notes Issue Ordinance and the Basic Law. In March 1997, the Government sold 15 per cent of its shareholding in HKNPL to the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, a People's Republic of China state-owned enterprise. In October 1997, the Government sold 10 per cent of HKNPL issued shares to each of the three note-issuing banks. The Government continues to exercise management control and maintains a majority stake in HKNPL, with the Chief Executive of the HKMA as the Chairman of the company.\n\nIn 2007, the bank has acquired polymer banknote technology to print the ten-dollar banknote for a trial period of two years.\n\nThe HKMA issues the 10-dollar note and the other three banks issue denominations of 20 (blue), 50 (green), 100 (red), 500 (brown) and 1,000 (gold) dollars.\n\nIn September 2009, Standard Chartered Bank issued the world's first 150-dollar denomination banknote, at its 150th anniversary. Approximately 750,000 notes were sold at above face value, in various combinations and presentations, as a commemorative charity issue. Although legal tender, the notes are unlikely to enter circulation, due to their rarity and expected higher re-sale value.\n\nFrom 13–20 February 2012, Hong Kong's Bank of China will be taking orders for a new 100-dollar note to commemorate the bank's 100th anniversary. Although legal tender, the notes aren't intended for circulation. 1,100,000 notes will be sold as numismatic products packaged in a folder for HK$150.

It is the primitive formless base of all matter similar to chaos, the quintessence or aether. Esoteric alchemists describe the prima materia using simile, and compare it to concepts like the anima mundi.\n\nThe concept of prima materia is sometimes attributed to Aristotle. The earliest roots of the idea can be found in the philosophy of Anaxagoras, who described the nous in relation to chaos. Empedocles' cosmogony is also relevant.\n\nWhen alchemy developed in Greco-Roman Egypt on the foundations of Greek philosophy, it included the concept of prima materia as a central tenet. Mary Anne Atwood uses words attributed to Arnaldus de Villa Nova to describe the role of prima materia in the fundamental theory of alchemy: \"That there abides in nature a certain pure matter, which, being discovered and brought by art to perfection, converts to itself proportionally all imperfect bodies that it touches.\" Although descriptions of the prima materia have changed throughout history, the concept has remained central to alchemical thought.\n\nAlchemical authors used similes to describe the universal nature of the prima materia. Arthur Edward Waite states that all alchemical writers concealed its \"true name\". Since the prima materia has all the qualities and properties of elementary things, the names of all kinds of things were assigned to it. A similar account can be found in the \"Theatrum Chemicum\":\nComparisons have been made to Hyle, the primal fire, Proteus, Light, and Mercury. Martin Ruland the Younger lists more than fifty synonyms for the prima materia in his 1612 alchemical dictionary. His text includes justifications for the names and comparisons. He repeats that, \"the philosophers have so greatly admired the Creature of God which is called the Primal Matter, especially concerning its efficacy and mystery, that they have given to it many names, and almost every possible description, for they have not known how to sufficiently praise it.\" Waite lists an additional eighty four names.\n\n"}

It is most noticeable in impulsive sounds from percussion instruments such as castanets or cymbals.\n\nIt occurs in transform-based audio compression algorithms – typically based on the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) – such as MP3, MPEG-4 AAC, and Vorbis, and is due to quantization noise being spread over the entire transform-window of the codec.\n\nThe psychoacoustic component of the effect is that one hears only the echo preceding the transient, not the one following – because this latter is drowned out by the transient. Formally, forward temporal masking is much stronger than backwards temporal masking, hence one hears a pre-echo, but no post-echo.\n\nIn an effort to avoid pre-echo artifacts, many sound processing systems use filters where all of the response occurs after the main impulse, rather than linear phase filters. Such filters necessarily introduce phase distortion and temporal smearing, but this additional distortion is less audible because of strong forward masking.\n\nAvoiding pre-echo is a substantial design difficulty in transform domain lossy audio codecs such as MP3, MPEG-4 AAC, and Vorbis. It is also one of the problems encountered in digital room correction algorithms and frequency domain filters in general (denoising by spectral subtraction, equalization, and others). One way of reducing \"breathing\" for filters and compression techniques using piecewise Fourier-based transforms is picking a smaller transform window (short blocks in MP3), thus increasing the temporal resolution of the algorithm at the cost of reducing its frequency resolution.\n\n\n"}

He was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and became secretary to the Camden Society in 1838. In 1845, he was appointed Clerk to the House of Lords, and subsequently Deputy Librarian at the House of Lords Library. In 1849, he founded \nthe quarterly journal \"Notes and Queries\", which for some years he also edited.\n\nThoms is credited with inventing the term \"folklore\" in an 1846 letter to the \"Athenaeum\". He invented this compound word to replace the various other terms used at the time, including \"popular antiquities\" or \"popular literature\". He was fond of the works of Jacob Grimm, which he considered remarkable.\n\nHis first book, \"Early Prose Romances\" (3 vol. 1827-1828), was published with encouragement from Francis Douce, and gave versions of English tales such as \"Robert the Devyl, Thomas a Reading, Friar Bacon, Friar Rush, Virgilius, Robin Hood, George a Green, Tom a Lincolne, Helyas, and Dr. Faustus\".\nAmong his publications are \"Lays and Legends\" (1834), \"The Book of the Court\" (1838), \"Gammer Gurton's Famous Histories\" (1846), \"Gammer Gurton's Pleasant Stories\" (1848). He also edited Stow's \"Survey of London\" in 1842.\nThoms was a leading member of the Folklore Society, founded in 1878, though his involvement in its establishment is poorly investigated.\n\nIn the 1870s, William Thoms began investigating claims to \"ultra-centenarianism.\" He is credited with first formulating the concept that claims of very old age are typically exaggerated. His book \"Human Longevity: Its Facts and Fictions\" (1873) laid down some rules for validating longevity claims.\n\nThoms died on 15 August 1885 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.\n\nThoms is associated with many publications, as editor, compiler or author. He used the pseudonym Ambrose Merton for several works.\nHe began a column titled Folk-Lore in Charles Wentworth Dilke's \"Athenaeum\" in 1846, the same publisher encouraged him to begin \"Notes and Queries\" and was editor of this until 1872.

Ratifications were exchanged in London on 9 July 1909, and the treaty established the modern Malaysia–Thailand border. The area around modern Pattani, Narathiwat, southernmost Songkhla, Satun, and Yala remained under Thai control, where decades later the South Thailand insurgency would erupt. Thailand relinquished its claims to sovereignty over Kedah (), Kelantan (, ), Perlis (, ) and Terengganu (, ) which entered the British sphere of influence as protectorates. These four states, along with Johor, later became known as the Unfederated Malay States.\n\nThe Kingdom of Siam was controlled by the monarch. Siam's ability to maintain its independence from British and French colonizers has often been credited to the ruling family, the Chakri dynasty. Although there were many previous monarchs, those most responsible for maintaining Siam's independence begins with Rama I (r.1782-1809). Unlike previous rulers, Rama I was a technocratic ruler who consulted with social elites on political matters and Sangha (Buddhist monks) on religious matters. His consultations with the Siamese elites became for his successors. Rama I was succeeded by Rama II (r.1809-1824). Rama II's greatest accomplishment was the establishment of a government of ministers. Near the end of his reign, in 1820, the British came on the scene seeking control of Penang. Rama II was followed by Rama III (r.1824-1851). He granted concessions to the British in exchange for their support. The same would be done later with the French. In 1826, in an effort to establish independence, Rama III and British officials signed the Burney Treaty. The treaty affirmed British assent that Kedah, Perlis, Terengganu, and Patani were Thai provinces while Penang and Province Wellesley belonged to the British and that the Siamese would permit British trade in Kelantan and Terengganu. After Rama III's reign, a succession crisis brought Mongkut (r.1851-1868) to power. Under Mongkut's leadership the Bowring Treaty of 1855 was signed. It provided British subjects in Siam with extraterritoriality, meaning that Britons would have British laws applied to them rather than Siamese. Mongkut constantly made concessions to the British and French to maintain independence in Siam until, in 1868, he was succeeded by Chulalongkorn, who ruled from 1868 to 1910. Chulalongkorn was a moderniser, similar to his predecessors. He abolished slavery, centralised revenues, created a national educational system, and safeguarded Siamese independence.\n\nThe Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, signed under the leadership of Chulalongkorn, consists of eight articles;\n\n\"The Siamese government transfers to the British government all rights of suzerainty, protection, administration and control whatsoever which they possess over the states of Kelantan, Tringganu, Kedah, Perlis, and adjacent islands. The frontiers of these territories are defined by the boundary protocol annexed hereto.\"\n\nThe transfer provided for in the preceding article shall take place within thirty days after the ratification of this treaty.\n\nA mixed commission, composed of Siamese and British officials and officers, shall be appointed within six months after the date of ratification of this treaty and shall be charged with the delimitation of the new frontier. The work of the commission shall be commenced as soon as the season permits, and shall be carried out in accordance with the boundary protocol annexed hereto.\n\nSubjects of his majesty the king of Siam residing within the territory described in article 1 who desire to preserve their Siamese nationality will, during the period of six months after the ratification of the present treaty, be allowed to do so if they become domiciled in the Siamese dominions. His Britannic majesty's government under take that they shall be at liberty to retain their immovable property within the territory described in article 1.\n\nIt is understood that in accordance with the usual custom where a change of suzerainty takes place, any concessions within the territories described in article 1 hereof to individuals or companies, granted by or with the approval of the Siamese government, and recognised by them as still in force on the date of the signature of the treaty, will be recognised by the government of his Britannic majesty.\n\nHis Britannic majesty's government undertake that the government of the Federated Malay States shall assume the indebtedness to the Siamese government of the territories described in article 1.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Siamese International Courts, established by article 8 of the treaty of 3 September 1883, shall, under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol annexed hereto, be extended to all British subjects in Siam registered at the British consulates before the date of the present treaty.\n\nThis system shall come to an end, and the jurisdiction of the International Courts shall be transferred to the ordinary Siamese courts after the promulgation and the coming into force of the Siamese codes, namely, the penal code, the civil and commercial codes, the codes of procedure, and the law for organisation of courts.\n\nAll other British subjects in Siam shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary Siamese courts under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol.\n\nBritish subjects shall enjoy throughout the whole extent of Siam the rights and privileges enjoyed by the natives of the country, notably the right of property the right of residence and travel.\n\nThey and their property shall be subject to all taxes and services, but these shall not be other or higher than the taxes and services which are or maybe imposed by law on Siamese subjects.

{"id": "2055543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055543", "title": "Mad Thinker", "text": "Mad Thinker\n\nThe Mad Thinker is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is portrayed to be an evil genius specializing in robotics. He is sometimes referred to just as \"The Thinker\".\n\nThe Mad Thinker was introduced by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in \"Fantastic Four\" #15 (June 1963). Lee and Kirby gave the mad scientist a special ability to predict events to the precise second.\n\nLittle to nothing was known of his origins or true identity until, over fifty years later, the Mad Thinker's first name was revealed to be Julius in the pages of Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev's \"Infamous Iron Man\" #2.\n\nThe professional criminal mastermind known as the Mad Thinker made his debut fighting the Fantastic Four. He once attempted to take over New York City using the Baxter Building as his base and all organized crime members as his lieutenants. The Fantastic Four were lured away from New York just before a meteorite struck the city and briefly knocked out electrical power, including the Baxter Building's defense systems. The Mad Thinker took the opportunity to create a robotic servant, the Awesome Android. He trapped the Fantastic Four in the lower quarters of the building but was eventually caught, after being stopped by an unforeseen factor: the building's mailman, Willie Lumpkin, who on Reed's orders rang a bell at 4 pm, activating a circuit breaker Reed had built into all his devices.\n\nIt seemed that his primary objective had not really been to take over the city, but to manipulate organized crime into helping him get into the Baxter building so that he could indulge his intellectual avarice by stealing the technology of Reed Richards. In that sense, the Fantastic Four did not really defeat him, they only defeated his pretext. The Mad Thinker would gladly get sent to prison for a peek at the secrets of what he considered the greatest mind in the world.\n\nAfter his initial defeat against the Fantastic Four, the Mad Thinker teamed with the Puppet Master for the first time. He used the original X-Men through a mind-controlled Professor X to battle the Fantastic Four. Again with the Puppet Master, he pitted the Thing against the Human Torch, but was foiled by Reed Richards. Later he created a radio-controlled bouncing ball with which he tried to eliminate the Thing and Torch while they were at a new dam's opening and nearly brought down the ball, but the Torch was able to destroy it.\n\nHe then created Quasimodo, a \"living\" computer. He located and revived the original Human Torch and used him to battle the present-day Torch. Later, with his Triumvirate of Terror (consisting of Piledriver, Hammerhead, and Thunderboot), he captured the Avengers, and invaded Avengers Mansion, believing that he had successfully overcome them by remembering to take advantage of the human element of his enemies' personalities that he had forgotten in the past, but he was nevertheless foiled by the unexpected intervention of Hercules, who had only recently begun to stay with the Avengers following his exile from Olympus.\n\nThe Mad Thinker impersonated Dr. Jose Santini, and disrupted an attempt to cure the Thing, causing the Thing to turn against the Fantastic Four. However, the Mad Thinker was captured by Mister Fantastic and the Human Torch. From his prison cell, he sent a battle android called the Monster Android against the Fantastic Four, but the android was sent into the Negative Zone by Mister Fantastic.\n\nHe allied with the Puppet Master again and with Egghead in their attempted blackmail of the United States government using a laser-firing satellite and a giant android called \"Gargan-Droid\". Again with the Puppet Master, he attacked the Fantastic Four using androids of their past foes. With the Puppet Master, he then battled Spider-Man and the Thing.\n\nThe Mad Thinker then took part in the Black Lama's contest of super-villains, but was defeated by Iron Man. Mad Thinker then re-established control of his robot the Scavenger and sent it against the Fantastic Four. He was defeated by Thundra, Tigra, and Brute. He then battled the Thing, Daredevil, Vision, and Yellowjacket. With the Puppet Master and Wizard, he attempted to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia Masters. The Mad Thinker later took control of the computers in Fantastic Four headquarters, but was foiled by Mister Fantastic.\n\nMad Thinker constructed android duplicates of his favorite thinkers in order to populate his own town called \"Ponder\" and had one of his robots bring Captain America to that town. Most of them were destroyed by Team America and Mad Thinker was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThe Mad Thinker later refused involvement in Loki's \"Acts of Vengeance\". He instead escaped prison, and sent Gargantua against Wonder Man and the Wasp in an attempt to forestall the proposed Super-Powers Registration Act. Later, he attempted a robbery using robot dinosaurs, and was foiled by Destroyer and Tattletale of Power Pack.\n\nThe Mad Thinker became interested in the young super-group called the New Warriors, and posed them a riddle when they first formed. In the final issue of the series, the answer to the riddle was revealed: the Mad Thinker's nephew had accidentally gained uncontrollable superpowers from his lab, killing his mother in the process. Now, the Thinker wanted them to help him.\n\nSince then, the Mad Thinker has been seen battling She-Hulk in a prison escape attempt. However, this Mad Thinker was revealed to be merely yet another android duplicate of the real Mad Thinker. Following the destruction of this android, the Awesome Android (now calling itself Awesome Andy) took custody of the android's still-functional head, until it was stolen by the teenage supervillain Southpaw.\n\nAlthough willing to kill heroes who get in his way, there are lines the Mad Thinker will not cross. A partnership with the Wizard was cut short after the kidnapping of the child Franklin Richards. The Wizard wished to experiment upon Franklin and learn the secret of his vast powers. The Mad Thinker, however, claimed that this had an almost certain probability of Franklin's death. When the Wizard acknowledged this, but decided to continue anyway, an angry Thinker dissolved the partnership and helped lead Franklin's godfather, The Thing, to where the Wizard had the boy hostage.\n\nWhen Spider-Man's dimwitted enemy Rhino had an operation that made him a genius Rhino broke the Mad Thinker out of jail so that Mad Thinker could work in Rhino's crime syndicate.\n\nThe Mad Thinker then allies himself with the Puppet Master, planning to strike against the Fantastic Four yet again. Told that he preferred to be called \"The Thinker\", The Puppet Master asked him why he had been called \"The Mad Thinker\" in the past. The reply was that he used to have \"repressed anger issues\". When the Puppet Master asks him about his anger, he replies that \"it isn't repressed any more\". He has built a device to amplify the Puppet Master's power so that they can escalate a battle between the two rival factions in the Super Hero Civil War.\n\nIn exchange for not being connected to the crimes on Yancy Street, Reed has the Mad Thinker double-check his calculations concerning the potential effects of not supporting the registration of all superheroes.\n\nDuring the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, Quasimodo analyzed his creator for Norman Osborn. He recommended to Norman that he would lead a group against Mad Thinker if Norman wanted to go after him.\n\nMad Thinker, along with Awesome Android, later appear as members of the Intelligencia. Mad Thinker even created the Gammadroid which he used to help MODOK and Hulk Robot capture Red Hulk.\n\nDuring a conflict between the Intelligencia and the Sinister Six as a prelude to the \"Ends of the Earth\" storyline, Mad Thinker was able to briefly deactivate Electro's powers, but was caught off-guard when Electro physically attacked him instead, the surprise of the attack allowing Electro to defeat him. He was presumably killed when Doctor Octopus used the Zero Cannon to launch him into space. MODOK Superior vows to find a way to restore his fellow Intelligencia members.\n\nMODOK Superior was able to revive Mad Thinker and the other Intelligencia members where they began to formulate their plans after their predicted shatter of the superhero community.\n\nDuring the \"Time Runs Out\" storyline, Mad Thinker was at some point contracted by Doctor Doom to be part of his attempts at uncovering the truth behind the Incursions. Thinker managed to tap into and map the Mapmakers network, allowing them to locate the source of the Incursions.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel,\" Mad Thinker appears as a member of Hood's incarnation of the Illuminati.\n\nSometime later, the Mad Thinker appears in La Paz, Bolivia where he is surprised by Doctor Doom in his version of the Iron Man armor, who offers him the chance to turn his life around in exchange for a device he used in a robot. Upon refusing, Mad Thinker activated a few robots to fight Doom only for him to be defeated. Mad Thinker is later shown to be in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.\n\nAfter escaping form S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Mad Thinker became obsessed with Mister Fantastic's whereabouts when he hasn't returned to Earth-616 yet. Misinterpreting Mister Fantastic's absence, Mad Thinker thinks that Mister Fantastic wants Mad Thinker to succeed him and the Fantastic Four. While styling his hair after Mister Fantastic and calling himself by that name, Mad Thinker hired three people named Lumen, Goodfire, and Smash to make up his Fantastic Four and gives them powers similar to the Fantastic Four. Mad Thinker now has elasticity, Lumen can become invisible with the side-effect of distorting the perception of the environment around him if he loses control of his invisibility, Goodfire has a blue fiery plasma form which she can't turn off and can also fly in this form, and Smash possesses super-strength and enhanced durability while sporting gold-colored skin. He took his Fantastic Four to follow Human Torch and Thing on their multiverse travels in order to eliminate the old remnants of the Fantastic Four. Mad Thinker's Fantastic Four confronts Human Torch and Thing in an unidentified reality. Despite Human Torch and Thing being powerless at the time, the two of them held their own against Mad Thinker's Fantastic Four until they escaped.\n\nThe Mad Thinker does not have superhuman powers. However, he is an extraordinary genius with knowledge of technology centuries beyond conventional science, for reasons unexplained. He has an eidetic memory and can rapidly organize and correlate vast amounts of information and perceive non-obvious patterns. He has the facilities and means to create all manner of sophisticated weaponry, androids, armor, and vehicles.\n\nHis analytical, mathematical, and geometrical abilities are of a sophisticated order not commonly found on Earth. He is particularly adept at computers, robotics, and artificial intelligence, with Ph.D.s in computer science and engineering. He has constructed his own android Awesome Android and twice resurrected the original Human Torch. He also built Quasimodo and the Scavenger, and various other equipment as needed, including monocle-sized hypno-lenses. In addition to his own achievements he has stolen much of the secret technology of Reed Richards, back in the incident when he took over the Baxter building.\n\nThe Mad Thinker is also a proficient disguise artist. Through a surgically implanted radio link, he is able to project his consciousness into an android simulacrum of himself.\n\nThe Thinker's intricate plans are most often foiled by what he refers to as the x-factor, or human unpredictability. Also the Thinker is not an intuitive genius (e.g., Reed Richards) and is thus incapable of true invention; instead, he synthesizes for his own use the creations of others (e.g., his android creations are based on discoveries of Reed Richards).\n\nThe Mad Thinker is able to escape from prison with little difficulty. He often uses his thoughts to control a robot at a remote, secret base. This gives him an alibi—he is already in prison.\n\nThe following robots and androids were created by Mad Thinker:\n\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Baxter Building was the home of a Think Tank of young geniuses, funded by the US Government. A girl named Rhona Burchill was considered for the project, but was denied due to her borderline psychotic tendencies. Enraged, she went home and concocted an accelerant that would allow her to think many times faster. Needing more brain mass to handle the drug, she anesthetized her brother Bobby, and using a crude surgical technique, cut out portions of his brain and grafted them onto her own. Claiming that \"You don't need a Think Tank - You just need a thinker\", she attacks the Baxter Building and lays a trap that ensnares the Fantastic Four, several soldiers and Fantastic Four supervisor Lt. Lumpkin. When she tells her story in her now stream of consciousness speech pattern to the Four, Reed calls her mad. She replies, \"If it's mad to think the unthinkable, then I'm the maddest thinker there ever was\".

During this appearance she attempted to steal Cerebro and use it to gain control of all the minds on the planet, but, with the aid of Wolverine, Shadowcat and Iceman, the Fantastic Four were able to distract her until Reed could reprogram Cerebro to cause Rhona to develop the power of empathy rather than control, forcing her to shut Cerebro down or lose herself amid the pain of the world.

{"id": "2055559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055559", "title": "Valmont (film)", "text": "Valmont (film)\n\nValmont is a 1989 French-American romantic drama film directed by Miloš Forman and starring Colin Firth, Annette Bening, and Meg Tilly. Based on the 1782 French novel \"Les Liaisons dangereuses\" by Choderlos de Laclos, and adapted for the screen by Jean-Claude Carrière, the film is about a scheming widow (Merteuil) who bets her ex-lover (Valmont) that he cannot corrupt a recently married honorable woman (Tourvel). During the process of seducing the married woman, Valmont ends up falling in love with her. Earlier, Merteuil learns her secret lover (Gercourt) has discarded her and is about to marry her cousin's daughter- a virginal 15 year old Cécile. As revenge, the jilted Merteuil employs Valmont (during his pursuit of Tourvel) to seduce Cécile before her marriage to Gercourt.\n\n\"Valmont\" received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design (Theodor Pištěk).\n\nIn 18th century France, the Marquise de Merteuil (Annette Bening), a beautiful wealthy widow, learns from her cousin Madame de Volanges (Siân Phillips) that Volanges' 15-year-old daughter Cécile (Fairuza Balk) has been betrothed to a middle-age man named Gercourt (Jeffrey Jones), Merteuil's own secret lover. The arranged marriage required that Cécile be raised in a convent to ensure her chastity. Unaware that Merteuil is Gercourt's lover, Volanges reveals that according to Gercourt, he is having trouble breaking off relations with his \"former\" mistress who is mentally unbalanced. Angered over the hypocrisy of Gercourt's insistence on a virgin bride while keeping a lover of his own, his concealment of his upcoming marriage, and his slight of her character, Merteuil plans revenge.\n\nMerteuil approaches her former lover, the notorious womanizer Vicomte de Valmont (Colin Firth), and proposes that he take Cécile's virginity before her wedding night to humiliate Gercourt. Valmont is not interested in seducing a child, whom he claims would be no challenge, but is pursuing Madame de Tourvel (Meg Tilly), a married woman staying at the estate of Madame de Rosemonde, Valmont's elderly aunt. Tourvel, well known for her virtue, had been warned of Valmont's debauchery and deliberately avoids him. Merteuil makes Valmont a wager: if Valmont succeeds in bedding Madame de Tourvel, he may also bed Merteuil; if he fails, he must consign himself to a monastery.\n\nAfter learning that Cécile's teenage music teacher, Danceny (Henry Thomas), has been writing love letters to Cécile, Merteuil gains the confidence of the young girl who confesses she loves Danceny. Merteuil attempts to create opportunities for the two young lovers to consummate their love, but Cécile is too innocent and Danceny too honorable to take advantage. Frustrated, Merteuil takes Cécile on holiday to Madame de Rosemonde's country estate, where Valmont had gone to pursue Tourvel. Valmont flirts playfully with the young girl, who is overwhelmed by his attention. When Merteuil suggests that Valmont help Cécile write to Danceny, Valmont goes to Cécile's room to help her write a passionate letter and ends up taking her virginity. Afterwards, a guilt-wracked Cécile runs to Merteuil for comfort, believing that neither her future husband nor Danceny will want her now. Merteuil encourages the girl to marry Gercourt and keep Danceny as her lover.\n\nWhen Tourvel feels her defenses weakening against Valmont, she flees to the city to escape temptation. Valmont rides to her residence and is there when she arrives. Unable to resist, Tourvel finally makes love with him. In the morning, Tourvel writes to her husband about her new lover, then leaves for the market to prepare a meal. When she returns, Valmont has already left to collect his \"prize\" from Merteuil.\n\nValmont arrives at Merteuil's residence, where Merteuil indifferently spreads herself on the bed and waits for Valmont to get on with it, causing Valmont to storm out. As revenge, he goes to Cécile and convinces her to write Danceny a letter explaining that Merteuil was behind the plan to cast Danceny as Cécile's lover. Tourvel later comes to Valmont and spends the night, leaving before he wakes the next morning. Her loss causes Valmont to realize he truly cared for her.\n\nValmont returns to Merteuil, but rather than insisting she keep her bargain, he proposes marriage, saying they would be better off working together than against one another. Merteuil sadly reminds him that they have already been married once, but that they always end up betraying one another. Merteuil invites Valmont to her bedroom, where Danceny is in her bed; he had come to threaten Merteuil, but she seduced him and told him everything. Valmont leaves in a fury and goes to Cécile, suggesting that they escape to the city where Cécile will be free to love whom she chooses. Instead, Cécile reveals that she has confessed everything to her mother, who orders Valmont from the house.\n\nThe next day, Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel to avenge Cécile's honor. Valmont prepares for the duel by drinking himself into a stupor and arrives hung over. The honorable Danceny refuses to duel him in his condition and is willing to accept an apology. Instead, Valmont charges Danceny with sword drawn, forcing Danceny to kill him in self-defense.\n\nValmont's funeral is filled with his former lovers, including Merteuil, who finds herself devastated at the loss of her best friend and oldest rival. Cécile reveals to Madame de Rosemonde that she (Cécile) is carrying Valmont's child; Rosemonde is overjoyed by the news. Cécile and Gercourt are soon married in a grand ceremony in the presence of the king, with Danceny surrounded by a pack of eligible young women and Merteuil looking on, alone.\n\nSome time later, Madame de Tourvel lovingly places a rose on Valmont's tomb before returning to her waiting husband.\n\n\nThe plot of \"Valmont\" differs significantly from Laclos's novel. In the novel, Cécile miscarries Valmont's child, and at the end retires to a convent; in \"Valmont\" she is pregnant at her wedding. In the novel, letters between Valmont and Merteuil are exposed, and Merteuil is publicly ridiculed and humiliated; in \"Valmont\", the letters are not mentioned, and Merteuil has no downfall except in the eyes of Cécile and her mother. She also does not suffer from the physical disfigurement described by Laclos in the denouement. Madame de Tourvel's future is less tragic: instead of dying of a broken heart, she returns to her forgiving and understanding older husband.\n\n\"Valmont\" was released to theaters in the United States on November 17, 1989, for a limited run.\n\nThe Region 1 DVD released in 2002 by MGM is missing a short sequence after Valmont wakes up alone from his last night with Tourvel. In the sequence, Valmont takes flowers to Tourvel's home later the same day, but on arrival discovers that she is back with her husband. Unseen by either, he leaves the flowers on her bed before heading off to confront Merteuil. The sequence is included in the 2000 MGM VHS release, and is also in the high-definition transfer shown on MGM HD.\n\n\"Valmont\" received mixed reviews, as it has a score of 55% on Rotten Tomatoes from 29 critics, and a Metacritic score of 55 from 14 critics. The film was not as highly acclaimed as \"Dangerous Liaisons\", which was released less than a year earlier.\n\nIn his review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars. Comparing it to \"Dangerous Liaisons\", which was based on the play rather than the novel, Ebert wrote that \"Valmont\" was a much different film than its predecessor. Where \"Dangerous Liaisons\" was \"cerebral and claustrophobic, an exercise in sexual mindplay\", Forman's version was \"more physical\" and the seductions more arousing.\n\nIn his review for \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers gave the film a mixed review. While observing that the film was \"rapturously beautiful, enticing us into a lush, aristocratic world\", he felt that there was \"nothing funny in the sight of Merteuil's decking out Cécile like a whore, nothing sexy in Valmont's indifferent rape of Cécile, nothing heroic in Valmont's futile duel with Danceny.\" Travers concluded, \"Overlong and marred by clashing accents and acting styles, \"Valmont\" lacks the wit and erotic charge of \"Dangerous Liaisons\". But Forman's vision is, finally, more humane, more devastating.\"\n\nIn her review in \"The New York Times\", film critic Janet Maslin observed that the film \"contributes virtually nothing to the body of information surrounding \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\".\" Maslin's major complaint was that the film lacked the \"bite\" of its predecessor, trivialized its characters, and showed \"a troubling lack of focus\".\n\nIn her review in \"The Washington Post\", Rita Kempley was equally unimpressed with \"Valmont\", describing it as \"sumptuous suds, a broadly played trivialization of de Laclos's 18th-century novel of boudoir intrigue\". Kemply concluded:\nThe film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n"}

In 2008 the project saw a significant departure from its previous themes and presented a more electronic soundscape with Arabic influences in its fourth album, \"Reborn\". In the following two years, Era released \"Classics\" and \"Classics 2\", which consisted in contemporary reinterpretations of classical works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Giuseppe Verdi, Antonio Vivaldi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, amongst others. In 2013, Era released its latest work, an album in collaboration with French singer and actress Arielle Dombasle entitled \"Arielle Dombasle by Era\".\n\nThe project has sold more than 12 million albums.\n\nEra mixes Gregorian chants and occasionally world music with contemporary electronic and pop-rock arrangements. It is reminiscent of new-age music projects such as Enigma, Gregorian, and Deep Forest.

{"id": "2055607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055607", "title": "Cumberland (rugby league team)", "text": "Cumberland (rugby league team)\n\nCumberland, officially known as Central Cumberland, were a rugby league team in 1908 based in the region of Cumberland Plain in western Sydney. They were one of the nine original teams in the first New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) season, albeit admitted after the first round of matches had already been played. They are the shortest lived team in the history of first-grade rugby league in Australia after disbanding late that year. Statistically, they are the club with the poorest all-time record, only lasting eight games in their inaugural and only season.\n\nThe Cumberland area was dominated by rugby union, another form of the game, as the main winter sport. The local Kings School took part in a regular competition of rugby union with other clubs Aallaroo, Calder House, Civil, Lyndhurst, Military, Newington, North Shore and Waratah. These teams in the area by 1900, were put under the banner of Western Suburbs Rugby Union.\n\nThe club was formed on the night of 21 April 1908 at Horse and Jockey Hotel, Homebush, the night after the first round of rugby league was being held in the NSWRL premiership. On that morning, Sydney newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\" advertised a meeting for that night to discuss the formation of rugby league club in the Cumberland area. The meeting was attended by annoyed members of the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\" who were asked to form a rugby league club under the name \"Central Cumberland\". \n\nWhen the Western Suburbs formed their club, most of their players had come from \"Ashfield Rugby Union Club\", which was a second division team to the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\". All but two of the first grade team of \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\" rejected offers from Western Suburbs. However, when Cumberland were looking for players, 23 of the 27 players present at the meeting signed with the club, most of which were rugby union players from the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\".\n\nThe NSWRL were reluctant to admit a ninth team into the premiership and proposed they merge with nearby team Western Suburbs. However, the clubs involved declined so the NSWRL agreed to allowing the Cumberland team to a trial match against Eastern Suburbs. While Eastern Suburbs won the match 18–4, the NSWRL was convinced of that they could be competitive. As the NSWRL premiership had already begun, the NSWRL had to reformat the draw to include Cumberland, which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine. Cumberland did not have a home ground, like some of the other teams, and would play their games at the Agricultural Ground, Birchgrove Oval and Wentworth Park.\n\nThe first match they played was against Souths on 9 May 1908 and despite the loss, the league praised the club over the 20,000 crowd that attended the game. Though the game, which Cumberland lost 23–2 was played as a curtain-raiser to an international match between Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBoth Cumberland and Western Suburbs had been winless to this point of the season and Cumberland had a score to settle with their rivals from \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\" who were with Western Suburbs rugby league club. Cumberland led 4–2 at half time, having two penalty goals kicked by Harry Bloomfield in the first half, however Western Suburbs goalkicker Jim Abercrombie kicked a penalty goal to equalise, after which George Cribb scored between the post and Bloomfield kicked the goal to make it 9–4. Abercrombie scored another penalty goal to make it 9–6, after which Bloomfield intercepted a pass, kicked the ball and regathered it to score which he also converted to win the match 14–6. Cumberland won its only game in the premiership season and ever.\nIn what turned out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the required thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from the opposing team North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the wooden spoon for finishing on the bottom of the competition ladder.\n\nCumberland's dismal winning percentage and the inability to field a team led to their disbanding at the end of the season. After only playing eight first-grade matches and one trial match, Cumberland ceased to exist and passed into history. Seven of the Cumberland players moved to neighbours Western Suburbs, although only Harry Bloomfield, A. Halling and S. Jarvis played first-grade rugby league again.\n\nCumberland's neighbour club Western Suburbs had used black and white as their colours, which had been taken from Ashfield rugby club, a second grade rugby union team which supplied many of Western Suburbs players. Unlike other clubs, Western Suburbs did not take their colours from their district rugby union team, due to Ashfield's influence at the club. Cumberland thought of using the bottle green of the \"Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club\"', as many of their team members were from there. However, the club believed that some would be unable to distinguish Western Suburbs and Cumberland if this approach was taken.\n\nThe club eventually chose the colours of the local Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was like many of the other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops of blue and gold were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.\n\nCumberland used twenty-four players in their eight matches:\n\n\"Cumberland has no representative players\"\n\nHarry Bloomfield, statistically, is Cumberland's best player. Bloomfield, along with A. Halling, S. Jarvis, Thomas Lalor and F. O'Grady played all eight matches for Cumberland. Bloomfield played fullback and scored nineteen points for Cumberland which encompassed one try and eight goals throughout the season which was enough to warrant representation for New South Wales in an interstate match against Queensland. This included eleven points in one match, against Wests in their only win for the Season. E. Bellamy claims hold to most tries in a season, scoring two, one in the match against Glebe, the other against Eastern Suburbs.\n\nStatistically, Cumberland are the worst team in the history of first-grade rugby league in Australia. They only have won 12.5% of their games, lower than Annandale (18.3%), which is also a defunct team. They won the wooden spoon for being last on the table in the 1908 season. They had only one win which was 14–6 over Western Suburbs, and had their worst loss in their final game against Norths, 45–0. They lost six consecutive games from 9 May 1908 until 27 June 1908, a win, then a final loss. They scored an average 4.75 points each game whereas they had an average of 23.88 points scored against them.\n\n"}

Originally meant to focus on Zack, \"Last Order\" highlighted Tseng's feelings and position in the Shinra company, as well as his moral values.\n\nAlthough the 77,777 copies of \"Advent Pieces: Limited\" that were released in Japan sold out months in advance of the official release date, \"Last Order\" received a negative fan response due to changes in content and presentation from the original \"Final Fantasy VII\" game, and because of this, the crew working on \"Crisis Core\" avoided recreating certain scenes from \"Last Order\".\n\n\"Last Order\" explores situations shown and referenced within \"Final Fantasy VII\" and other \"Compilation\" titles. The world of \"Final Fantasy VII\", referred to as \"the Planet\", is dependent for its survival on a flow of spirit energy called the Lifestream. The megacorporation Shinra eventually rises to power and begins extracting the Lifestream through Mako reactors, killing the Planet. Shinra uses the Mako as an energy source and to manipulate the strength and abilities of their paramilitary organization, SOLDIER. Sephiroth, considered the strongest member of SOLDIER, is sent to investigate a Mako reactor in the secluded town of Nibelheim and is accompanied by the SOLDIER Zack and two grunts, one of whom is Cloud. While there, Sephiroth spends most of his time reading in the Shinra Mansion, which had previously been used by the Shinra scientist Hojo to conduct experiments. Through Hojo's log books, Sephiroth comes to learn of his past, in which he was injected with Jenova's cells. The Planet had once been inhabited by the Cetra (or \"Ancients\"), who were almost completely destroyed by Jenova, an extraterrestrial lifeform that crashed onto the Planet 2,000 years previously, and began infecting the Cetra with a virus. When Jenova was unearthed by a Shinra science team, it was mistakenly identified as a Cetra. This caused Sephiroth to believe he was also a Cetra, and that humans had betrayed his ancestors.\n\nNarrated by Tseng, leader of the elite espionage and assassination division known as the Turks, \"Last Order\" switches between the Nibelheim incident and Zack Fair's escape to Midgar with his unconscious friend, Cloud Strife. During the Nibelheim event, Sephiroth, insane after discovering his origins, sets fire to the village of Nibelheim. After killing many villagers, he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased. Tifa, a resident of Nibelheim, attacks him soon after he arrives. Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova's body, preserved in a large glass tank filled with liquid. Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and they engage in combat, but Sephiroth is able to disarm and incapacitate him. Sephiroth returns to Jenova's body, but does not notice Cloud approaching.\nCloud immediately impales Sephiroth with his sword, cracking Jenova's glass tank. He returns to Tifa and the two converse, while Sephiroth cuts off Jenova's head. He carries the head with him towards Cloud and they engage in battle. During the fight, Cloud is impaled through the stomach and hung over the reactor's core. In a feat of strength, he grabs Sephiroth's sword and moves himself down the blade to solid ground and hurls Sephiroth aside. Sephiroth abandons the battle and jumps into the reactor core with Jenova's head in an attempt to reach the \"Promised Land\". Although Zack and Cloud survive the ordeal, they are taken to the Shinra Mansion by Hojo for experimentation.\n\nThe other event detailed in \"Last Order\" illustrates Zack and Cloud's escape from Shinra. While at the Shinra Mansion, Cloud had succumbed to Mako poisoning caused by a surge of memories flooding through his mind, rendering him in an unconscious, non-reactant state. Zack escapes with Cloud from the Mansion with the intention of returning to Midgar, the headquarters of Shinra. However, Shinra orders their paramilitary and the Turks to find and eliminate the two escapees. Tseng decides to capture them alive.\n\nOn a bluff overlooking Zack and Cloud, who had hitched a ride on a truck, Shinra operatives decide to ignore orders to wait for the Turks. One takes aim at the incapacitated Cloud. Zack jumps in front of Cloud, yelling at him to escape.\n\n\nOther roles include Keiji Okuda, Atsushi Imaruoka, Ryūji Mizuno, and Daisuke Kirii as members of Shinra's military unit who attempt to apprehend Cloud and Zack. Yōhei Tadano and Katsuhisa Hōki voice villagers at Nibelheim.\n\n\"Last Order: Final Fantasy VII\" was produced and scripted by Madhouse and directed by Morio Asaka. The decision to create \"Last Order\" arose from the positive reaction towards a popular promotional clip created by Madhouse for the game \"Before Crisis\". Madhouse was chosen to produce the OVA partly because of their success with the clip and because the president of Madhouse was very enthusiastic about the project. However, the main reason for choosing Madhouse was that the company \"understood the significance\" of making a \"Final Fantasy VII\" animation, as it was considered a large responsibility to animate \"the most popular game in the FF [\"Final Fantasy\"] series.\" Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for the \"Final Fantasy VII\" series and co-director of \"Advent Children\", acted as the supervising director. He had the right to reject or accept concept drawings for \"Last Order\". As a result, Nomura had a large quantity of images redrawn, to the extent that \"the entire production was in jeopardy.\"\n\nProduction lasted six months. The production crew considered the most challenging part of creating the OVA to be making \"Nomura's drawings move on screen.\" Because \"Last Order\" was hand-drawn, the crew faced difficulties creating uniform lines. Another issue was the overall feel of each scene; original drawings were done by several artists, resulting in various scenes having different styles. Producer Akio Ofuji explained that they \"wanted to make sure the final product was of very high quality, so [they] worked with the production company day and night, straight through to the deadline.\" Nomura and Ofuji agreed that many scenes showing important events and feelings in \"Final Fantasy VII\" had been fragmented and disjointed, and so they had decided that those scenes would be the subject of \"Last Order\", giving the audience of \"Advent Children\" (the film \"Last Order\" was released with) a \"more enjoyable understanding.\" They used the film as an opportunity to portray Zack \"properly\" as a \"handsome, light-hearted man [who] was in everyone's memory\". \"Last Order\" also details Tseng's growth and his feelings towards his both job and events depicted, wherein he attempts to \"get his own ideas of justice heard\" but later abandons his moral values \"in order to carry out a cruel mission.\" Ofuji commented that \"those are the kind of scenes we wanted people to be more aware of.\"\n\n\"Last Order\" was originally released in Japan with the \"Ultimate Edition\" of the \"Advent Children\" movie, \"Advent Pieces: Limited\", on September 14, 2005. The OVA was included in the North American \"Limited Edition Collector's Set\" of \"Advent Children\", released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on February 20, 2007. The North America release did not come with an English dub and the OVA is subtitled. \"Last Order\" was not included in the release of \"\", a 2009 director's cut of \"Advent Children\" with extra footage.\n\nThe \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\" is a series of prequels and sequels to the original \"Final Fantasy VII\" game. \"Last Order\" is not part of the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\" and is considered an outside work. However, it has been associated with the \"Final Fantasy VII\" series since its creation, and is mentioned alongside official installments in official guidebooks and Ultimanias. \"Compilation\" titles include the film \"\" and games \"\" (mobile phone), \"\" (PS2), and \"\" (PSP). Like \"Last Order\", \"\" (a mobile phone spin-off of \"Dirge of Cerberus\") is an outside work associated with the \"Compilation\".\n\n\"Last Order\"'s score was composed, arranged, and produced by Takeharu Ishimoto, including the ending theme entitled \"Last Order\". The music was combined with the music from \"Before Crisis\" on a single soundtrack and released in Japan on December 19, 2007. The soundtrack was later made available in North America by Square Enix. Tracks 13 through 27 on the disc contain the score from \"Last Order\", while tracks 1 through 12 contain music from \"Before Crisis\". Select tracks on the soundtrack of \"Crisis Core\" contain music and remixes of music from the OVA.\n\nOverClocked ReMix's four-disc tribute album, \"Voices of the Lifestream\", has a disc entitled \"Order\". The name was chosen to coincide with \"Last Order\", and the music is themed after it.\n\nOnly 77,777 copies of \"Advent Pieces: Limited\" were produced in Japan, and they are no longer available, having been sold out months in advance of its release. They retailed for ¥29,500, or US$300, each while the North American collector's edition retailed for $49.95.\n\nOverall, \"Last Order\" garnered positive feedback from Western critics. Chris Carle of IGN noted that \"Last Order\" was \"the true meat of the new extras [in the \"Advent Children\" collector's set]… a traditionally animated chapter for FF [\"Final Fantasy\"] fans that centers on the story of Zack and Cloud\" and that \"it adds even more dimension to the story [of \"Final Fantasy VII\"].\" Todd Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk called \"Last Order\" \"the real reason to check out the Limited Edition release for \"Advent Children\"\" and commented that as \"a long-time anime fan and lover of \"Final Fantasy\",\" he \"was enthralled by every minute to be had in \"Last Order\".\" However, Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of \"Crisis Core\", stated that they had received \"considerable negative feedback\" from fans, who were displeased with changes made to the Nibelheim event in \"Last Order\". Due to this, the scene was redone for \"Crisis Core\", and the production crew was careful to avoid making the same decisions.\n\n"}

They released three studio albums, \"deadstar\" (October 1995), \"Milk\" (April 1997) and \"Somewhere Over the Radio\" (September 1999). Two singles reached the top 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart, \"Run Baby Run\" and \"Deeper Water\", both in 1999. The group were nominated for three ARIA Music Awards. The group disbanded in 2001. \n\nDeadstar were formed in August 1995 in Melbourne as a pop music band. Initially they were a side-project for Barry Palmer on guitar and bass guitar who was also in Hunters & Collectors and Peter Jones (of Crowded House) on drums. The pair invited Caroline Kennedy (ex-Plums) into the studio to write melodies and lyrics over tracks of guitar music on the score they had recorded for a proposed short film, \"The Baby Bath Massacre\".\n\nThe group's first album, \"Deadstar\", was issued in October 1995, it was produced by Palmer for the White Records label and distributed by Mushroom Records and Festival Records. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the album as a \"mix of trashy pop and indie guitar rock [which] found a ready-made market. There were plenty of loose arrangements in the songs, with Palmer's guitar and Kennedy's quavering, imperfect vocals laid down rough and raw\". They released CD singles from the album, \"Going Down\" / \"Valentine's Day\" (June 1995), \"She Loves She\" (October) and \"Sister\" (April 1996). The singles were co-written by Jones, Kennedy and Palmer, except \"She Loves She\" which was co-written by the three with Charlie Marshall.\n\nIn November 1996 Jones' bandmate from Crowded House, Nick Seymour, joined on bass guitar – allowing Palmer to concentrate on lead guitar for live performances. Stu Thomas had earlier been approached to join on bass but turned it down due to solid commitments in Kim Salmon and the Surrealists. Deadstar toured the United Kingdom where \"Valentine's Day\" was issued as the A-side of their debut single for Discordant Records. Late that year, Palmer started producing the debut solo album, \"King Without a Clue\", for Nick's older brother, Mark, which was released in the following year. Mark was Palmer's bandmate in Hunters & Collectors, Palmer co-wrote five tracks with Mark and provided lead guitar. Fellow deadstar members, Nick (on bass guitar, backing vocals and piano) and Jones (on drums and percussion), also worked on the album.\n\nIn January 1997, Deadstar appeared on the Big Day Out tour. In August that year they issued their second studio album, \"Milk\", which Palmer co-produced with Kalju Tonuma (Nick Barker, The Mavis's). McFarlane felt the album contained \"garagey pop gems\". In Australia two singles were released from the album, \"Don't It Get You Down?\" (September 1996) and \"I've Got Something to Tell You\" (June 1997). Both singles were co-written by Jones, Kennedy and Palmer. In the UK they issued \"Sex Sell\" as their lead single from \"Milk\" (titled \"Deadstar\" for the European market) on Discordant Records. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 \"Don't It Get You Down?\" was nominated for Best Independent Release. Late that year Nick Seymour left Deadstar and was replaced on bass guitar by Pete McCracken – Kennedy's bandmate from Plum and her future husband.\n\nBy mid-1998 Michael den Elzen (ex-Schnell Fenster, Rebecca's Empire) joined on lead guitar and Deadstar started recording their third album, \"Somewhere Over the Radio\". Its lead single, \"Run Baby Run\", appeared in January 1999, which reached the top 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart. \"Run Baby Run\" was co-written by Kennedy and Palmer. Deadstar employed The Killjoys' band member, Anna Burley, as auxiliary keyboardist when performing live. A second single, \"Deeper Water\", appeared in June, which peaked at No. 28. \"Deeper Water\" was also co-written by Kennedy and Palmer. The album followed in September and was co-produced by Palmer, Tonuma and Mark Opitz (AC/DC, The Angels, INXS).\n\nDuring 1999 Mushroom Records owner Michael Gudinski sold his record label to Festival Records. As a result of the negotiations and subsequent sale of Mushroom Records, the promotion of deadstar's album was compromised. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 \"Run Baby Run\" was nominated for Best Pop Release. A third single, \"Somewhere Over the Radio\", appeared in May 2000 but did not chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 \"Somewhere Over the Radio\" was nominated for Best Rock Album. The group disbanded in 2001.\n\nThe band enjoyed mixed commercial success during their existence. They had some success in the UK and toured there after extensive radio play of \"Sex Sell\". They were played on national Australian radio station Triple J with two of their tracks listed on its annual Hottest 100: \"Don't It Get You Down\" at No. 70 in 1996 and \"Deeper Water\" at No. 74 in 1999. They were picked up by commercial radio stations and their music was used in TV (\"Run Baby Run\" on \"Home and Away\", \"Queen Kat Carmel and St. Jude\", and \"Good News Week\"; \"Deeper Water\" on \"The Panel\") and film productions.\n\nBefore Caroline Kennedy joined Deadstar she played guitar and sang in The Plums, with Shamus Goble on drums, Pete McCracken on bass guitar and Stephen Moffatt on guitar. McFarlane described their sound as \"mixed strident guitar riffs with melodic pop roots\" and Kennedy as \"the band's focal point with her tough-but-graceful presence, opinionated views and emotion-charged, if imperfect, vocals\". While a member of Deadstar she also had her own project, The Caroline Kennedy Conspiracy, with Goble and McCracken, joined by Ted Cleaver on guitar. After Deadstar had disbanded in 2001 Kennedy, McCracken and Goble formed The Kicksilvers with McCracken's sister, Jane on bass guitar. In 2002 Kennedy, McCracken and Goble formed The Tulips and they released a country-tinged album, \"In the Honeycone\" (May 2003).\n\nBarry Palmer continued to write, record and perform with Hunters & Collectors during his time with Deadstar until that group disbanded in March 1998. Palmer formed his own label, The Devil's Music, and continued to record, produce and write.\n\nPeter Jones worked as a session musician for various groups including in Ross Hannaford's Reggaebites (2002). As a producer he worked on albums by Stephen Cummings \"Firecracker\" (3 February 2003), \"Close Ups\" (16 August 2004), Tess McKenna \"Boom Bam\" (2003), Rebecca Barnard \"Fortified\" (2006) ; and also worked as a teacher in Melbourne. He died on 18 May 2012 of brain cancer, aged 49.\n\nDeadstar were nominated for three ARIA Music Awards\n\n"}

He co-wrote most of Kamelot's songs with the band's guitarist and founder Thomas Youngblood during his tenure. Khan had retired from music in 2011 until 2018, when he released a new solo song on YouTube and announced the return of Conception.\n\nKhan was born March 12, 1970 to a Norwegian mother and Thai father and took both of their last names. Khan's maternal grandfather, Kåre Sætre, was a major influence on his musical aspirations, something Khan would state in several interviews. Sætre would later appear alongside his grandson on stage several times. Khan began singing at a young age, and at the age of 17, while in the shower at school, Khan was caught singing \"Alone\" by Heart by a fellow student and was offered to join his band. After graduating from high school, Khan studied opera for three years.\n\nDuring his school years, he shortened \"Khantatat\" to \"Khan\" as he found it easier, and frequently used it as a nickname. He is also credited as \"Khan\" on most early albums.\n\nAfter finishing his opera studies, Khan joined the Norwegian progressive metal band Conception, after its previous lead singer quit in 1991. He was selected after several potential singers auditioned. The band released several albums over the coming years before disbanding in 1998, a year after Khan left the band to pursue a career with Kamelot.\n\nIn 2005, Khan reunited with Conception and played at the 2005 ProgPower USA VI festival on Friday 16 September and Norwegian Scream Magazine's 15 Years & 100 Issues Festival on Saturday, October 1. Khan, guitarist Tore Østby (also known from the band ARK) and the rest of Conception reunited; at the time it was clarified Khan would continue to support Kamelot.\n\nIn 1997, Khan was invited to join Kamelot by guitarist and founder Thomas Youngblood, after the band's previous vocalist was fired. Khan performed lead vocals on the subsequent releases \"Siége Perilous\" (1998), \"The Fourth Legacy\" (1999), \"Karma\" (2001), \"Epica\" (2003), \"The Black Halo\" (2005), \"Ghost Opera\" (2007), and \"Poetry for the Poisoned\" (2010). During his tenure, Khan also co-wrote most of the songs alongside Youngblood, most notably on \"Poetry for the Poisoned\".\n\nOn August 14, 2010, Kamelot performed in Hungary for what would turn out to be their final performance with Roy Khan. A few weeks later, it was announced that Khan would not be joining the first North American leg of the upcoming tour in support of \"Poetry for the Poisoned\" due to illness, with the band initially planning to use a replacement vocalist, before later deciding to postpone the North American tour entirely while he recovered.\n\nAfter much speculation among fans and media that Khan was seriously ill or had left the band, Khan himself confirmed his departure from the band in his blog on April 21, 2011, with the band making the formal announcement the day after. In the announcement, Youngblood wrote that Khan had been given a lot of time to make the decision and the band respected it. The tour eventually went on with Rhapsody of Fire vocalist Fabio Lione, while his permanent replacement, Tommy Karevik, joined Kamelot the following year.\n\nIn a brief interview with local Norwegian media in 2014, Khan stated that he had suffered a burnout, and decided to quit the band before the tour in 2010 to prioritize his health and family, but in an agreement with Youngblood and the rest of the band, they would not announce his departure in case he recovered and changed his mind. In a 2018 interview with Italian magazine \"Loud and Proud\", Khan elaborated on his final years with Kamelot, stating that he had become gradually more and more burned out due to overworking himself, suffering from insomnia and depression. He stated that the decision to quit the band was made after performing at Wacken that year, as he no longer enjoyed performing.\n\nAfter his departure, Khan joined the Moss Frikirke local church in Moss, Norway. In 2013, photos of Khan performing psalms at his local church were posted online by a fan page, along with audio recordings of him performing \"You Raise Me Up\". These were later removed on Khan's request, as he didn't want the attention. In a short statement to the fan page, he confirmed that he still enjoyed metal music, and denied rumours of an upcoming gospel CD, saying he would not be returning to music \"any time soon\". He worked at the church as a counselor and youth minister until September 2016.\n\nOn April 1, 2018, Roy Khan released a song on YouTube called \"For All\", leading many fans to speculate in an upcoming return to music.\n\nOn April 30, 2018, it was announced that Roy Khan and the other members of Conception had reunited, proving the speculations of his return to music to be true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his discoveries of several chemical products of economic importance, extracted from tar, such as eupione, waxy paraffin, pittacal (the first synthetic dye) and phenol (an antiseptic). He also dedicated himself in his last years to research an unproved field of energy combining electricity, magnetism and heat, emanating from all living things, which he called the Odic force.\n\nReichenbach was educated at the University of Tübingen, where he obtained the degree of doctor of philosophy. At the age of 16 he conceived the idea of establishing a new German state in one of the South Sea Islands, and for five years he devoted himself to this project.\n\nAfterwards, directing his attention to the application of science to the industrial arts, he visited manufacturing and metallurgical works in France and Germany, and established the first modern metallurgical company, with forges of his own in Villingen and Hausach in the Black Forest region of Southern Germany and later in Baden.\n\nReichenbach conducted original scientific investigations in many areas. The first geological monograph which appeared in Austria was his \"Geologische Mitteilungen aus Mähren\" (Vienna, 1834).\n\nHis position as the head of the large chemical works, iron furnaces and machine shops upon the great estate of Count Hugo secured to him excellent opportunities for conducting large-scale experimental research. From 1830 to 1834 he investigated complex products of the distillation of organic substances such as coal and wood tar, discovering a number of valuable hydrocarbon compounds including creosote, paraffin, eupione and phenol (antiseptics), pittacal and cidreret (synthetic dyestuffs), picamar (a perfume base), assamar, capnomor, and others. Under the name of eupione, Reichenbach included the mixture of hydrocarbon oils now known as waxy paraffin or coal oils. In his paper describing the substance, first published in the \"Neues Jahrbuch der Chemie und Physik\", B, ii, he dwelt upon the economical importance of this and of its associate paraffins, whenever the methods of separating them cheaply from natural bituminous compounds would be established.\n\nReichenbach expanded on the work of previous scientists, such as Galileo Galilei, who believed the Earth's axis was magnetically connected to a universal central force in space, in concluding that Earth's magnetism comes from magnetic iron, which can be found in meteorites. His reasoning was that meteorites and planets are the same, and no matter the size of the meteorite, polar existence can be found in the object. This was deemed conclusive by the scientific community in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1839 Von Reichenbach retired from industry and entered upon an investigation of the pathology of the human nervous system. He studied neurasthenia, somnambulism, hysteria and phobia, crediting reports that these conditions were affected by the moon. After interviewing many patients he ruled out many causes and cures, but concluded that such maladies tended to affect people whose sensory faculties were unusually vivid. These he termed \"sensitives\".\n\nInfluenced by the works of Franz Anton Mesmer he hypothesised that the condition could be affected by environmental electromagnetism, but finally his investigations led him to propose a new imponderable force allied to magnetism, which he thought was an emanation from most substances, a kind of \"life principle\" which permeates and connects all living things. To this vitalist manifestation he gave the name \"Odic force\".\n\nEnglish translations:\n\nCharacters in the fantasy novel, The Hollow People by Brian Keaney (Orchard Books 2006) manipulate Odyllic force, an energy which is accessed through waking dreams.\n\nReichenbach and his Odic force are referred to in the game \"\".\n\n\n"}

British forces opened fire on tribals who had gathered on the Mangarh hillock situated in the Aravali mountains on the Rajasthan-Gujarat border. The tribals were led by their leader Govind Guru who inspired them to throw off the yoke of British rule.\n\nGovind Guru, influenced by social reformers like Dayanand Saraswati, launched the 'Bhagat movement among the Bhils asking them to adhere to vegetarianism, and abstain from all types of intoxicants. The movement slowly took on a political hue and turned into a movement against the oppressive policies of the British.\n\nThe Bhils began opposing taxes imposed by the British and forced labour imposed by the princely states of Banswara, Santrampur, Dungarpur and Kushalgarh. Worried by the tribal revolt, the Britishers and princely states decided to crush the uprising. From October 1913, \"Govind guru\" asked his followers to gather at Mangarh hill from where they would conduct their operations.\n\nThe British asked them to vacate Mangarh hill by 15 November, but they refused.

Through the museum, its commemorative programs and educational initiatives, it aims to promote respect for diversity and the sanctity of human life. The Museum was founded in 1979 as the Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre and is Canada's first and only recognized Holocaust museum.\n\nThe Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre was founded in 1979 by members of the Association of Survivors of Nazi Oppression and young members of the Montreal Jewish community, and led by Steven Cummings.\n\nIt opened in its current location in the Allied Jewish Community Services building (now Federation CJA). The Centre served as a museum with a permanent exhibition and a memorial centre.\n\nAfter World War II, Jewish immigrants settled in Montreal, making it the third largest population of Holocaust survivors in the world in proportion to its inhabitants after Israel and New York. The Centre became distinguished for its collection featuring artefacts and testimonies primarily from local survivors.\n\nIn 2003, the Centre underwent a renovation funded by government grants and private and corporate donations to expand and improve the existing collection. The centre launched the current permanent exhibit, \"\"To Learn, To Feel, To Remember\"\".\n\nIn 2010, director Carl Leblanc released the documentary film \"The Heart of Auschwitz\", based on the heart-shaped book exhibited in the museum. The film retraces the book's history and the stories of the women who signed it. He later published \"Artefact\" in 2012, a fictional story inspired by the book. \" \"\n\nIn 2013, a free app was developed for electronic devices and smartphones on Apple and Android platforms. The app can be used in the permanent exhibition and as an educational tool for classrooms unable to visit the museum. It provides additional in-depth information on the subjects and objects displayed in the exhibit. Interactive touch-screens featuring maps and timelines were added in 2014 to modernize the exhibit.\n\nIn 2016, the Centre was renamed the Montreal Holocaust Museum to reinforce its openness to the public and its mandate as the only Holocaust museum in Canada.\n\nThe majority of the Museum's collection is composed of artefacts donated by local Holocaust survivors and their descendants.\n\nTo date, the museum's collection of artefacts numbers over 12,900 objects relating to life before, during and after the Holocaust, with 85% of the collection digitized. Over 100 key artefacts from the collection are displayed on the museum's website and the Artefacts Canada database. Over 4,000 artefacts are accessible digitally through the Canadian Jewish Heritage Network. Notable objects in the collection include an urn containing ashes from Auschwitz-Birkenau that is on permanent display in the museum's commemoration room, and the Heart from Auschwitz, a heart-shaped book with birthday wishes made by a group of young women in Auschwitz. The Heart was given to a woman named Fania Fainer, who smuggled it out of the concentration camp and eventually donated the book to the museum.\n\nThe museum also holds the largest oral history collection of Holocaust survivors’ stories in Canada. The museum's oral history program started in 1994. Since then the museum has recorded and archived over 800 oral histories, and continues to do so. In 2016, it participated in the Canada Collection oral history project that consolidated more than 1,250 testimonies from Holocaust survivors across Canada and preserved them in the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive.\n\nTo Learn, To Feel, To Remember is the current permanent exhibition that went on display with the renovation in 2003. When it launched it featured 418 artifacts, 372 photographs and 10 video stations. It is designed to reflect Jewish culture and history in Europe before the war, the destruction of Jewish life during the Nazi era and the Holocaust, and how the survivors who immigrated to Montreal and Canada rebuilt their lives.\n\nUnited Against Genocide: Understand, Question, Prevent aims to educate the public about genocide, its implications and how to prevent it. The exhibit examines the similarities and differences between the Armenian Genocide, Cambodian Genocide, the Genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda and the Holocaust through testimonies, interviews and archives.\n\n\"And In 1948, I Came to Canada\": The Holocaust in Six Dates focuses on six key dates of the Holocaust, from the Nazi party's rise to power to the liberation of concentration camps. There is also an emphasis on Canada's reaction to the Holocaust and survivors’ lives in Canada. The exhibition uses artefacts from the museum's collection and testimonies from Montreal survivors.\n\nThe museum has three virtual exhibitions available for free online.\n\nBuilding New Lives follows the stories of Jewish refugees in Canada after World War II and their contributions to society as they made communities in Canada their home.\n\nUnited Against Genocide: Understand, Question, Prevent explores the similarities and differences between genocides to educate about its implications and prevention.\n\nHolocaust Life Stories features biographies and video testimonies from Holocaust survivors.\n\nEvery year the Museum organizes a number of events open to the public including annual Yom Hashoah and Kristallnacht commemorations attended by survivors, members of the Jewish community and dignitaries. It also commemorates the Roma Genocide and International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nThe Roma Genocide commemoration was first held in 2016 in partnership with Romanipe, a local non-profit that combats prejudice against Roma and advocates for Canada to recognize the Genocide of Roma and Sinti.\n\nThe museum also organizes events for the public that educate about the Holocaust and current human rights issues with guest speakers, films, workshops and Holocaust survivor testimonies.\n\nThe Museum develops a number of educational resources for teachers on the Holocaust and human rights. Pedagogical tools, such as A \"Brief History of Antisemitism in Canada, The Heart From Auschwitz,\" and \"Hana’s Suitcase\" are produced in English and French and available for free on its website.\n\nThe museum also organizes a biennial conference to assist and train educators in teaching about the Holocaust and human rights. In 2017, the Museum received a grant from the Canadian government's Inter-Action fund for the Beyond the Walls of the Montreal Holocaust Museum project. The project, in conjunction with teacher's associations, universities, Holocaust education centres, Jewish Federations and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, provides educators in various provinces with tools to teach about the Holocaust, genocide and human rights.\n\nSince 2012, the Museum has taken public positions in order to take a stand on issues related to the history of the Holocaust and human rights of concern to Canadian citizens. It issues statements, organizes events and maintains a social media presence in order to promote diversity and public awareness by bridging the gap between the past and the present.\n\nThe Museum issued statements denouncing Quebec's Bills 60 and 62 on the grounds of racism and prejudice because they reinforced prejudices and alienated minority groups.\n\nWorking with human rights organizations and minority groups is another way the museum addresses current issues. It has taken an active role in advocating and supporting refugee rights through statements and events.\n\nThe museum is affiliated with: Federation CJA, CMA, CHIN, VMC, SMQ, Musées Montréal, IHRA and AHO.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055676", "title": "Annandale (rugby league team)", "text": "Annandale (rugby league team)\n\nAnnandale were an Australian rugby league football club which played in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership from 1910 to 1920. Based in Annandale, New South Wales and nicknamed \"The Dales\", the club's colours were red and gold.\n\nThe club was never able to finish higher than fifth in their eleven-year history and won just one match in their final three seasons. This, combined with the industrialisation of the area led to their omission from the competition for further seasons at the end of 1920. All these events are often attributed to the fact that fewer players were eligible to play under the residency rules in place at the time (Glebe would also later fall victim, in part, to this phenomenon).\n\nAnnandale began their first season with a very poor start, losing their first four games straight which as it turned out sent them immediately out of the race for the premiership. They did, however, recover well and finished with five wins, one draw and eight losses. The first of these wins came in round 5 against a Western Suburbs side that had won just 3 out of 23 matches in their three-year history. At the end of the season, Annandale finished sixth out of the eight teams.\n\nThe 1911 season was arguably Annandale's most successful, managing to win five of their fourteen games, equalling their performance in the previous year. However, they were able to finish one place higher on the ladder, in fifth position.\n\nIn 1912 the club were able to claim an 8–5 win against Balmain in the second round of the season but followed this up with eleven losses in a row. In equal last position with Western Suburbs heading into the final round of the season, the two clubs by coincidence were scheduled to play their final match of the season against one another. Despite having lost to Western Suburbs in round seven, Annandale won the match 15–6, avoiding them claiming the wooden spoon.\n\nAs it turned out, the scenario for Annandale in the final rounds of the 1913 season were similar to those they experienced in 1912. They were again in equal last position with Western Suburbs with two rounds to play and up against one another in a match which would most likely decide who would finish last. Replicating their win from the previous season, Annandale took out the match 18–0. Although they lost their last match of the season narrowly to second-placed Newtown 10–8 whilst Western Suburbs won their own match, Annandale are deemed to have avoided the last place due to a superior points scoring difference despite finishing on equal competition points.\n\nThe club claimed just one draw from their first eleven games of the 1914 season, leaving them in last position and three points behind Western Suburbs. The two teams travelled to Goulburn, with Annandale needing to win to avoid receiving their first wooden spoon. In this match, however, Western Suburbs won 6–4, ensuring Annandale were to finish last. Although claiming an elusive win, their only one of the season, against three-time defending premiers Eastern Suburbs in the second last round of the season, their effort was futile as they took out their first wooden spoon.\n\nIn 1915 the club got three wins, including another one against Western Suburbs in the final match of the season, to finish two points clear of last-placed North Sydney and Western Suburbs. In 1916 they began the season poorly, winning just one of their first ten games and leaving them two points behind Western Suburbs in last position. They were then able to win three games in a row and ended up finishing seventh. The 1917 season was more of the same for the club, losing their first nine matches before claiming two draws in the next three weeks. In a match against equal last North Sydney in the second last round of the season, Annandale prevailed in a close match 3–2 meaning they were again able to narrowly avoid the wooden spoon.\n\nAnnandale were unable to win a game in 1918, scoring ten points or more just twice whilst conceding ten points or less on just two occasions. They won just one match in 1919, an important second-last round match against North Sydney which was to again decide who would finish in last position. This victory allowed them to finish seventh despite having won just the one match. In 1920 they once again failed to win a match and lost by less than 9 points on only one occasion.\n\nOut of the 33 clubs that have contested in the premiership over the years, Annandale's performance is ranked as the second worst of all. Out of 153 games played, the club won 25, drew six and lost 122 for a winning percentage of 18.3%. As of 2016, only on seven occasions has a team failed to win a game in a season. Annandale achieved this twice, in 1918 and 1920.\n\nBiggest Win\n\nBiggest Loss\n\nMost Consecutive Wins\n\nMost Consecutive Losses\n\nWooden Spoons\n\n\n"}

According to the manufacturer Gold Flex offers superior bulletproof protection. Gold Flex is a laminated material consisted of cross-laid non-woven fibers in a resin matrix. Because the fibers are laid straight and not in a woven fabric configuration superior bullet penetration resistance is claimed by the manufacturer. When an object strikes this material a \"web\" of its clusters absorb the impact by a good percentage and minimizes penetration. Per the manufacturer since this is a straight fibre-based creation, all fibres on the GoldFlex works together on the vest or material to stop the impact.\n\nGoldFlex gives great resistance to abrasion and resists organic solvents making itself nonconductive, low flammable, and a great fabric that has an amazing resistance to elevated temperatures. Its degradation point starts from 500 °C and it has no melting point. It is sensitive to salts, acids, and ultraviolet radiation. When it comes to the static build-up in the body it is prone to it as well [1]. Protection is also based on the pressure of the impact. Some of these fabrics are only designed with hand-guns in mind basically making anything with a bigger calibre a threat potential. One cannot wear a GoldFlex and expect a large caliber round (E.G .50 BMG round) to be stopped from penetrating it. Also GoldFlex is not the only material that is responsible for minimizing penetration and absorbing the attack. Along with GoldFlex there are other layers on top of this fabric to ensure that the object does not penetrate through the material.\n\nWhen a bullet strikes the body armor, it hits ballistic fiber which is strong enough to not let it through. This fibre absorbs and disperses the impact that has been made by the bullet to the body armor. This process continues and every layer of this material is effected until the bullet has reached to a full stop. All layers combined together form a larger area of the impact to disperse and keep the bullet from penetrating the carrier. This helps reducing the risk of blunt force trauma also known as injuries to internal organs.\n\nKevlar is five times stronger than steel of equivalent weight. It was invented by a Polish-American chemist Stephanie Kwolek and introduced in the 1970s. It is used for body armor and racing tires but is more expensive than Gold Flex. Twaron is another alternative to Gold Flex but is not much in demand. Occasionally several materials are used in one product.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a poetic film that tries to paint a picture of the urban culture undergoing westernization. The movie takes place in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. As the characters try to come to terms with the invasion of capitalism, neon signs, grand 5-star hotels, and Coca-Cola signs, their paths begin to merge.\n\nThis was the first American film to be made in Vietnam after Bill Clinton lifted the embargo. The filmmakers were followed by Vietnamese inspectors throughout filming.\n\nIn the misty mornings of Saigon, young girls wake up to pick lotuses from a flower pond, to later sell to American tourists and fellow Vietnamese alike. To pass the time, the girls sing rich folk songs that touch the heart of a poet (Teacher Dao) who lives in an old temple overlooking the pond. Teacher Dao (Manh Cuong Tran) suffered leprosy at the age of 26 and had consequently lost his fingers.\n\nThe girls (one of them a newcomer named Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) are trucked off to the bustling streets of Saigon where they sell the lotus in bundles for 5,000 đồng VND (roughly 30 cents USD). In Saigon, we meet different aspects of its inhabitants. Woody is a 9- to 10-year-old street peddler who sells cigarettes, chewing gum, and various other things in a box that hangs on a strap to his shoulder. Hai (Don Duong) is a cyclo driver who hangs out with his buddies near a grand hotel.\n\nThrough a chance meeting, Hai eventually falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui) who works as a prostitute in big hotels. Even seemingly happy after receiving every American dollars from her clients, she carries a silent resentment of herself and her clients. She tells Hai that she won't be doing this job for long and dreams of sleeping in an air-conditioned room, with no one to bother her. Lan tries to embrace the capitalist invasion by re-inventing herself and though she resents the lifestyle, she promises to one day live like them. Hai respects her and sees through her pain. After winning $200 USD in a cyclo race, he treats her to her dream. Lan feels guilty and rejects Hai's advances. She feels that she is incapable and doesn't deserve Hai's special treatment. During one of the last scenes of the film, Lan finally comes to terms with herself and Hai as he takes her to a place streaming with red \"phượng vĩ\" (Royal Poinciana) blossoms. Lan, dressed in a beautiful white áo dài (traditional Vietnamese dress), marvels at her surroundings.\n\nHai's encounter with Kien An is a ridicule of the western embrace of \"convenience\". Kien An's flowers, hand-picked and real, are being driven out by mass-produced plastic flowers. Hai comments that they are even sprayed with perfume to imitate the smell. The only difference is that the plastic flowers never wilt and die. Hai wants no part in this and asks Kien An for two. Kien An respects him and gives him the lotus for free.\n\nKien An's tale involves various personal tragedies and how poetry can triumph and provide respite for the human soul. Teacher Dao is particularly interested in Kien An's song because it reminds him of his days as a small boy (when he was \"light and pure\") along the river markets. Teacher Dao also tells Kien An of a recurring dream. He dreams of being able to visit the river markets and drop white lotuses, letting them float downriver.\n\nKien An remarks that Teacher Dao's pain involves his inability to leave the seemingly abandoned temple. Teacher Dao corrects her and says that even though he never leaves the place, in spirit, he yearns for the songs of the birds, the scent of the lotus, and the freedom of the clouds that lazily float in the sky. In his prime, he was a successful poet. After losing his fingers to leprosy, Teacher Dao had given up hope of ever writing again. Kien An wants to help him and so she promises to lend him her fingers. From time to time, Kien An would visit his home in the temple to copy whatever the poet recites.\n\nSoon, ill health as the result of old age and leprosy takes away the poet's life. Huy (Hoang Phat Trieu), Teacher Dao's headman, carries out one of his final wishes and gives Kien An Dao's poetry book, which contains a never-before seen picture of Dao. The two remarks that he was very handsome before being overtaken by leprosy. Kien An asks Huy for help to make the late Dao's dream come true. She visits the river market and drops lotus flowers, just like in Dao's dream.\n\nJames Hager is an American G.I. who returns to Vietnam to look for his daughter, in hope of \"coming to peace with this place\". Hai and his buddies jokingly say that Hager probably lost a few screws in his head. They witness him sitting in front of a hotel for weeks, smoking, staring at a restaurant across the street. They watch him with curiosity but never approach him. His story ends with him meeting his daughter. He gives her a bundle of lotus buds he has bought from Kien An and tries to talk with her.\n\nThrough these intertwining tales, Tony Bui is able to portray the struggles of a vanishing culture. Kien An represents the country's old ways, living as if untouched by time. Lan represents the country's present, re-inventing herself and hoping to embrace the capitalist invasion. Hai (the cyclo driver) acts as a bridge between the past and the present, living care-free yet observing the \"improvements\" of westernization with a silent resentment. Woody, the young peddler, acts as the country's future, naïve, innocent, and easily fooled. Woody's story ends with him playing soccer with his friends in the rain.\n\nIn order of appearance (major characters):\n\nThe film was met with critical acclaim. The film has a score of 81% with a certified \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews and scored a 90% audience approval rating as well\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote \"We require Asia to be ancient, traditional and mysterious. It fills a need. We don't want to know that Hong Kong is a trade capital and Japan is an economic giant. We're looking for Shangri-La, for the sentimental fantasies of generations of Western writers who fell for the romantic idea of the East -- and centuries of Eastern writers who did, too. \"Three Seasons\" is so languorously beautiful, because it has the sentiment of a Chaplin film, because exotic customs and settings are so seductive, we change the rules. What is wrong in Chicago becomes colorful, even enchanting, in the former Saigon. Taken as a fable, it's enchanting. Art often offers us such bargains; it is better to attend \"La Boheme\" than to freeze in a garret.\"\n\n\n\"Three Seasons\" was the first in Sundance Film Festival history to ever receive both the Grand Jury Award and Audience Award.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2055706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055706", "title": "Statism in Shōwa Japan", "text": "Statism in Shōwa Japan\n\nThis statist movement dominated Japanese politics during the first part of the Shōwa period (reign of Emperor Hirohito). It was a mixture of ideas such as Japanese ultranationalism, militarism, fascism and state capitalism, that were proposed by a number of contemporary political philosophers and thinkers in Japan.\n\nWith a more aggressive foreign policy, and victory over China in the First Sino-Japanese War and over Imperial Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan joined the Western imperialist powers. The need for a strong military to secure Japan's new overseas empire was strengthened by a sense that only through a strong military would Japan earn the respect of Western nations, and thus revision of the \"unequal treaties\" imposed in the 1800s.\n\nThe Japanese military viewed itself as \"politically clean\" in terms of corruption, and criticized political parties under a liberal democracy as self-serving and a threat to national security by their failure to provide adequate military spending or to address pressing social and economic issues. The complicity of the politicians with the \"zaibatsu\" corporate monopolies also came under criticism. The military tended to favor dirigisme and other forms of direct state control over industry, rather than free market capitalism, as well as greater state-sponsored social welfare to reduce the attraction of socialism and communism in Japan.\n\nThe special relation of militarists and the central civil government with the Imperial Family supported the important position of the Emperor as Head of State with political powers, and the relationship with the nationalist right-wing movements. However, Japanese political thought had relatively little contact with European political thinking until the 20th century.\n\nUnder this ascendancy of the military, the country developed a very hierarchical, aristocratic economic system with significant state involvement. During the Meiji Restoration, there had been a surge in the creation of monopolies. This was in part due to state intervention, as the monopolies served to allow Japan to become a world economic power. The state itself owned some of the monopolies, and others were owned by the zaibatsu. The monopolies managed the central core of the economy, with other aspects being controlled by the government ministry appropriate to the activity, including the National Central Bank and the Imperial family. This economic arrangement was in many ways similar to the later corporatist models of European fascists.\n\nDuring the same period, certain thinkers with ideals similar to those from shogunate times developed the early basis of Japanese expansionism and Pan-Asianist theories. Such thought later was developed by writers such as Saneshige Komaki into the \"Hakkō ichiu\", Yen Block, and Amau doctrines.\n\nThe 1919 Treaty of Versailles did not recognize the Empire of Japan's territorial claims, and international naval treaties between Western powers and the Empire of Japan (Washington Naval Treaty and London Naval Treaty) imposed limitations on naval shipbuilding which limited the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy at a 10:10:6 ratio. These measures were considered by many in Japan as refusal by the Occidental powers to consider Japan an equal partner. The latter brought about the May 15 incident.\n\nOn the basis of national security, these events released a surge of Japanese nationalism and resulted in the end of collaboration diplomacy which supported peaceful economic expansion. The implementation of a military dictatorship and territorial expansionism were considered the best ways to protect the \"Yamato-damashii\".\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Ministry of Home Affairs began arresting left-wing political dissidents, generally in order to exact a confession and renouncement of anti-state leanings. Over 30,000 such arrests were made between 1930 and 1933. In response, a large group of writers founded a Japanese branch of the International Popular Front Against Fascism, and published articles in major literary journals warning of the dangers of statism. Their periodical, , achieved a circulation of over five thousand and was widely read in literary circles, but was eventually censored, and later dismantled in January 1938.\n\nIkki Kita was an early 20th-century political theorist, who advocated a hybrid of state socialism with \"Asian nationalism\", which thus blended the early ultranationalist movement with Japanese militarism. His political philosophy was outlined in his thesis \"Kokutairon and Pure Socialism\" of 1906 and ( \"\") of 1923. Kita proposed a military coup d'état to replace the existing political structure of Japan with a military dictatorship. The new military leadership would rescind the Meiji Constitution, ban political parties, replace the Diet of Japan with an assembly free of corruption, and would nationalize major industries. Kita also envisioned strict limits to private ownership of property, and land reform to improve the lot of tenant farmers. Thus strengthened internally, Japan could then embark on a crusade to free all of Asia from Western imperialism.\n\nAlthough his works were banned by the government almost immediately after publication, circulation was widespread, and his thesis proved popular not only with the younger officer class excited at the prospects of military rule and Japanese expansionism, but with the populist movement for its appeal to the agrarian classes and to the left wing of the socialist movement.\n\nShūmei Ōkawa was a right-wing political philosopher, active in numerous Japanese nationalist societies in the 1920s. In 1926, he published , among other works, which helped popularize the concept of the inevitability of a clash of civilizations between Japan and the west. Politically, his theories built on the works of Ikki Kita, but further emphasized that Japan needed to return to its traditional \"kokutai\" traditions in order to survive the increasing social tensions created by industrialization and foreign cultural influences.\n\nSadao Araki was a noted political philosopher in the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1920s, who had a wide following within the junior officer corps. Although implicated in the February 26 Incident, he went on to serve in numerous influential government posts, and was a cabinet minister under Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe.\n\nThe Japanese Army, already trained along Prussian lines since the early Meiji period, often mentioned the affinity between \"yamato-damashii\" and the \"Prussian Military Spirit\" in pushing for a military alliance with Italy and Germany along with the need to combat Marxism. Araki's writing are imbued with nostalgia towards the military administrative system of former shogunate, in a similar manner to which the National Fascist Party of Italy looked back to the ancient ideals of the Roman Empire or the NSDAP in Germany recalled an idealized version of First Reich and the Teutonic Order.\n\nAraki modified the interpretation of the \"bushido\" warrior code to \"seishin kyōiku\" (\"spiritual training\"), which he introduced to the military as Army Minister, and to the general public as Education Minister, and in general brought the concepts of the Showa Restoration movement into mainstream Japanese politics.\n\nSome of the distinctive features of this policy were also used outside Japan. The puppet states of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and the Wang Jingwei Government were later organized party in accordance with Araki's ideas. In the case of Wang Jingwei's state, he himself had some German influences—prior to the Japanese invasion of China, he met with German leaders and picked up some fascist ideas during his time in the Kuomintang. These, he combined with Japanese militarist thinking. Japanese agents also supported local and nationalist elements in Southeast asia and White Russian residents in Manchukuo before war broke out.\n\nSeigō Nakano sought to bring about a rebirth of Japan through a blend of the samurai ethic, Neo-Confucianism, and populist nationalism modeled on European fascism. He saw Saigō Takamori as epitomizing the 'true spirit' of the Meiji \"ishin\", and the task of modern Japan to recapture it.\n\nIkki Kita and Shūmei Ōkawa joined forces in 1919 to organize the short-lived Yūzonsha, a political study group intended to become an umbrella organization for the various right-socialist movements. Although the group soon collapsed due to irreconcilable ideological differences between Kita and Ōkawa, it served its purpose in that it managed to join the right-wing anti-socialist, Pan-Asian militarist societies with centrist and left-wing supporters of state socialism.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, these supporters of Japanese statism used the slogan , which implied that a new resolution was needed to replace the existing political order dominated by corrupt politicians and capitalists, with one which (in their eyes), would fulfill the original goals of the Meiji Restoration of direct Imperial rule via military proxies.\n\nHowever, the Shōwa Restoration had different meanings for different groups. For the radicals of the \"Sakurakai\", it meant violent overthrow of the government to create a national syndicalist state with more equitable distribution of wealth and the removal of corrupt politicians and \"zaibatsu\" leaders. For the young officers it meant a return to some form of \"military-shogunate in which the emperor would re-assume direct political power with dictatorial attributes, as well as divine symbolism, without the intervention of the Diet or liberal democracy, but who would effectively be a figurehead with day-to-day decisions left to the military leadership.\n\nAnother point of view was supported by Prince Chichibu, a brother of Emperor Shōwa, who repeatedly counseled him to implement a \"direct imperial rule\", even if that meant suspending the constitution.\n\nIn principle, some theorists proposed Shōwa Restoration, the plan of giving direct dictatorial powers to the Emperor (due to his divine attributes) for leading the future overseas actions in mainland Asia. This was the purpose behind the February 26 Incident and other similar uprisings in Japan. Later, however, these previously mentioned thinkers decided to organize their own political clique based on previous radical, militaristic movements in the 1930s; this was the origin of the Kodoha party and their political desire to take direct control of all the political power in the country from the moderate and democratic political voices.\n\nFollowing the formation of this \"political clique\", there was a new current of thought among militarists, industrialists and landowners that emphasized a desire to return to the ancient shogunate system, but in the form of a modern military dictatorship with new structures. It was organized with the Japanese Navy and Japanese Army acting as clans under command of a supreme military native dictator (the \"shōgun\") controlling the country. In this government, the Emperor was covertly reduced in his functions and used as a figurehead for political or religious use under the control of the militarists.\n\nThe failure of various attempted coups, including the League of Blood Incident, the Imperial Colors Incident and the February 26 Incident, discredited supporters of the Shōwa Restoration movement, but the concepts of Japanese statism migrated to mainstream Japanese politics, where it joined with some elements of European fascism.\n\nEarly Shōwa statism is sometimes given the retrospective label \"fascism\", but this was not a self-appellation. When authoritarian tools of the state such as the Kempeitai were put into use in the early Shōwa period, they were employed to protect the rule of law under the Meiji Constitution from perceived enemies on both the left and the right.\n\nSome ideologists, such as Kingoro Hashimoto, proposed a single party dictatorship, based on egalitarian populism, patterned after the European fascist movements. \"An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus\" shows the influence clearly.\n\nThese geopolitical ideals developed into the , stating that Japan assumed total responsibility for peace in Asia, and can be seen later when Prime Minister Kōki Hirota proclaimed justified Japanese expansion into northern China as the creation of \"a special zone, anti-communist, pro-Japanese and pro-Manchukuo\" that was a \"fundamental part\" of Japanese national existence.\n\nAlthough the reformist right wing, kakushin uyoku, was interested in the concept, the idealist right wing, or kannen uyoku, rejected fascism as they rejected all things of western origin. \n\nBecause of the mistrust of unions in such unity, the Japanese went to replace them with in every factory, containing both management and worker representatives to contain conflict. This was part of a program to create a classless national unity. The most famous of the councils is the , which survived the dismantling of the councils under the US-led Allied occupation. The TRTA is now the Tokyo Metro.\n\nThe \"Kokuhonsha\" was founded in 1924 by conservative Minister of Justice and President of the House of Peers Hiranuma Kiichirō. It called on Japanese patriots to reject the various foreign political \"-isms\" (such as socialism, communism, Marxism, anarchism, etc.) in favor of a rather vaguely defined \"Japanese national spirit\" (\"kokutai\"). The name \"\"kokuhon\"\" was selected as an antithesis to the word \"\"minpon\"\", from \"minpon shugi\", the commonly-used translation for the word \"democracy\", and the society was openly supportive of totalitarian ideology.\n\nOne particular concept exploited was a decree ascribed to the legendary first emperor of Japan, Emperor Jimmu, in 660 BC: the policy of .\n\nThis also related to the concept of kokutai or national polity, meaning the uniqueness of the Japanese people in having a leader with spiritual origins. The pamphlet \"Kokutai no Hongi\" taught that students should put the nation before the self, and that they were part of the state and not separate from it. \"Shinmin no Michi\" injoined all Japanese to follow the central precepts of loyalty and filial piety, which would throw aside selfishness and allow them to complete their \"holy task.\"\n\nThe bases of the modern form of kokutai and hakkō ichiu were to develop after 1868 and would take the following form:\n\n\nThe concept of the divine Emperors was another belief that was to fit the later goals. It was an integral part of the Japanese religious structure that the Tennō was divine, descended directly from the line of Ama-Terasu (or Amaterasu, the Sun Kami or Goddess).\n\nThe final idea that was modified in modern times was the concept of Bushido. Bushido was the warrior code and laws of feudal Japan, that while having cultural surface differences, was at its heart not that different from the code of chivalry or any other similar system in other cultures. In later years, the code of Bushido found a resurgence in belief following the Meiji Restoration. At first, this allowed Japan to field what was considered one of the most professional and humane militaries in the world, one respected by friend and foe alike. Eventually, however, this belief would become a combination of propaganda and fanaticism that would lead to the Second Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and World War II.\n\nIt was the third concept, especially, that would chart Japan's course towards several wars that would culminate with World War II.\n\nDuring 1940, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe proclaimed the \"Shintaisei\" (New National Structure), making Japan into a \"National Defense State\". Under the National Mobilization Law, the government was given absolute power over the nation's assets. All political parties were ordered to dissolve into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, forming a one-party state based on totalitarian values. Such measures as the National Service Draft Ordinance and the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement were intended to mobilize Japanese society for a total war against the West.\n\nAssociated with government efforts to create a statist society included creation of the \"Tonarigumi\" (residents' committees), and emphasis on the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" (\"Japan's Fundamentals of National Policy\"), presenting a view of Japan's history, and its mission to unite the East and West under the \"Hakkō ichiu\" theory in schools as official texts. The official academic text was another book, \"Shinmin no Michi\" (The Subject's Way), the \"moral national Bible\", presented an effective catechism on nation, religion, cultural, social, and ideological topics.\n\nImperial Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933, bringing it closer to Nazi Germany, which also left that year, and Fascist Italy, which was dissatisfied with the League. During the 1930s Japan drifted further away from Western Europe and the United States. American, British, and French films were increasingly censored, and in 1937 Japan froze all American assets throughout its empire.\n\nIn 1940, the three countries formed the Axis powers, and became closer linked. Japan imported German propaganda films such as \"Ohm Krüger\" (1941), advertising them as narratives showing the suffering caused by Western imperialism.\n\nJapanese statism was discredited and destroyed by the failure of Japan's military in World War II. After the surrender of Japan, Japan was put under Allied occupation. Some of its former military leaders were tried for war crimes before the Tokyo tribunal, the government educational system was revised, and the tenets of liberal democracy written into the post-war Constitution of Japan as one of its key themes.\n\nThe collapse of statist ideologies in 1945–46 was paralleled by a formalisation of relations between the Shinto religion and the Japanese state, including disestablishment: termination of Shinto's status as a state religion. In August 1945, the term State Shinto (\"Kokka Shintō\") was invented to refer to some aspects of statism. On 1 January 1946, Emperor \"Shōwa\" issued an imperial rescript, sometimes referred as the \"Ningen-sengen\" (\"Humanity Declaration\") in which he quoted the Five Charter Oath (\"Gokajō no Goseimon\") of his grandfather, Emperor Meiji and renounced officially \"the false conception that the Emperor is a divinity\". However, the wording of the Declaration – in the court language of the Imperial family, an archaic Japanese dialect known as \"Kyūteigo\" – and content of this statement have been the subject of much debate. For instance, the renunciation did not include the word usually used to impute the Emperor's divinity: \"arahitogami\" (\"living god\"). It instead used the unusual word \"akitsumikami\", which was officially translated as \"divinity\", but more literally meant \"manifestation/incarnation of a \"kami\" (\"god/spirit\")\". Hence, commentators such as John W. Dower and Herbert P. Bix have argued, Hirohito did not specifically deny being a \"living god\" (\"arahitogami\").\n\n\n\n"}

Her first child, Gemma, died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in 1989 at the age of 13 weeks, although she was never charged in connection with Gemma's death.\n\nHer conviction was based on claims that she had smothered the children, but was overturned as unsafe by the Court of Appeal on 10 December 2003. Cannings was convicted after the involvement in her case of Professor Sir Roy Meadow, a paediatrician who was later struck off, then reinstated, by the General Medical Council.\n\nThe Cannings case was re-examined after a BBC \"Real Story\" investigation showed that her paternal great-grandmother had suffered one sudden infant death and her paternal grandmother two. Professor Michael Patton, a clinical geneticist at St George's Hospital Medical School, told the BBC that a genetic inheritance was the most likely explanation for the crib deaths in the family.\n\nExpert witness Professor Sir Roy Meadow was later struck off the General Medical Council register partly as a result of his evidence at the Cannings trial. Meadow based his calculations on the likelihood of a second cot death being the same as the likelihood of a first, whereas in households where one crib death has taken place, the probability of another is greatly increased. He also asserted cot death implausible (which was contrary to the opinion of other specialists). Cannings later said Meadow should be \"severely punished\" for his testimony in her case and others. Meadow was later reinstated to the GMC on appeal, a judge ruling that his errors did not amount to serious professional misconduct.\n\nThe quashing of Cannings' conviction and other high-profile cases resulted in a review of 297 other cases where conviction relied on expert witness opinion. On 14 February 2006, Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, announced that three of these cases needed to be reconsidered by the courts, but that the majority did not give rise to concern.\n\n\n"}

The precise definition of the solution is quite complicated, but very instructive.\n\nAny exact solution of the Einstein field equation which models an electromagnetic field, must take into account all gravitational effects of the energy and mass of the electromagnetic field. Besides the electromagnetic field, if there lacks matter and non-gravitational fields present, we must \"simultaneously\" solve the Einstein field equation and the Maxwell field equations.\n\nIn Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, one of the most important types of an electromagnetic field are those representing electromagnetic radiation. Of these, the most important examples are the electromagnetic plane waves, in which the radiation has planar wavefronts moving in a specific direction at the speed of light. Of these, the most basic are the monochromatic plane waves, in which only one frequency component is present. This is precisely the phenomenon which our solution will model in terms of general relativity.\n\nThe metric tensor of the unique exact solution modeling a linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave with amplitude and frequency can be written, in terms of Rosen coordinates, in the form\n\nwhere formula_2 is the first positive root of where formula_3. In this chart, are null coordinate vectors while are spacelike coordinate vectors.\n\nHere, the \"Mathieu cosine\" is an even function which solves the \"Mathieu equation\" and also takes the value . Despite the name, this function is \"not\" periodic, and it cannot be written in terms of sinusoidal or even hypergeometric functions. (See Mathieu function for more about the Mathieu cosine function.)\n\nIn our expression for the metric, note that are null vector fields. Therefore, is a timelike vector field, while are spacelike vector fields.\n\nTo define the electromagnetic field, we may take the electromagnetic four-vector potential\n\nWe now have the complete specification of a mathematical model formulated in general relativity.\n\nOur spacetime is modeled by a Lorentzian manifold which has some remarkable symmetries. Namely, our spacetime admits a six-dimensional Lie group of self-isometries. This group is generated by a six-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vector fields. A convenient basis consists of one null vector field, \nthree spacelike vector fields,\nand two additional vector fields,\n\nHere, formula_8 generate the Euclidean group, acting within each planar wavefront, which justifies the name \"plane wave\" for this solution. Also formula_9 show that all nontranverse directions are equivalent. This corresponds to the well-known fact that in flat spacetime, two colliding plane waves always collide \"head-on\" when represented in the appropriate Lorentz frame.\n\nFor future reference we note that this six-dimensional group of self-isometries acts \"transitively\", so that our spacetime is \"homogeneous\". However, it is \"not isotropic\", since the transverse directions are distinguished from the non-transverse ones.\n\nThe frame field\n\nrepresents the \"local Lorentz frame\" defined by a family of \"nonspinning inertial observers\". That is,\nwhich means that the integral curves of the timelike unit vector field are timelike geodesics, and also \nwhich means that the spacelike unit vector fields are nonspinning. (They are Fermi–Walker transported.) Here, formula_16 is a timelike unit vector field, while formula_17 are spacelike unit vector fields.\n\nNonspinning inertial frames are as close as we can come in curved spacetimes to the usual \"Lorentz frames\" known from special relativity, where Lorentz transformations are simply changes from one Lorentz frame to another.\n\nWith respect to our frame, the electromagnetic field obtained from the potential given above is\nThis electromagnetic field is a source-free solution of the Maxwell field equations on the particular curved spacetime which is defined by the metric tensor above. It is a \"null solution\", and it represents a \"transverse\" sinusoidal electromagnetic plane wave with amplitude and frequency , traveling in the direction. When we\nwe find that the Einstein field equation is satisfied. This is what we mean by saying that we have an exact electrovacuum solution.\n\nIn terms of our frame, the stress–energy tensor turns out to be\nThis is \"exactly the same expression\" that we would find in classical electromagnetism (where we neglect the gravitational effects of the electromagnetic field energy) for the null field given above; the only difference is that now our frame is a \"anholonomic (orthonormal) basis\" on a \"curved spacetime\", rather than a \"coordinate basis\" in \"flat spacetime\". (See frame fields.)\n\nThe Rosen chart is said to be \"comoving\" with our family of inertial nonspinning observers, because the coordinates are all constant along each world line, given by an integral curve of the timelike unit vector field formula_21. Thus, in the Rosen chart, these observers might appear to be motionless. But in fact they are in relative motion with respect to one another. To see this, we should compute their expansion tensor with respect to the frame given above. This turns out to be\n\nwhere\n\nThe nonvanishing components are identical, and are \nPhysically, this means that a small spherical 'cloud' of our inertial observers \"hovers\" momentarily at and then begin to collapse, eventually \"passing through one another\" at . If we imagine them as forming a three-dimensional cloud of uniformly distributed test particles, this collapse occurs orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the wave. The cloud exhibits no relative motion in the direction of propagation, so this is a \"purely transverse\" motion.\n\nFor formula_25 (the shortwave approximation), we have approximately\n\nwhere the exact expressions plotted in red and the shortwave approximations in green.\n\nThe vorticity tensor of our congruence \"vanishes identically\", so the world lines of our observers are \"hypersurface orthogonal\". The three-dimensional Riemann tensor of the hyperslices is given, with respect to our frame, by\n\nwhere\nThis brings the solution into its representation in terms of Brinkmann coordinates:\nSince it can be shown that the new coordinates are geodesically complete,\nthe Brinkmann coordinates define a global coordinate chart.\nIn this chart, we can see that an \"infinite sequence\" of \"identical\" expansion-recollapse cycles occur!\n\nIn the Brinkmann chart, our frame field becomes rather complicated:\n\nand so forth. Naturally, if we compute the expansion tensor, electrogravitic tensor, and so forth, we obtain exactly the same answers as before, but expressed in the new coordinates.\n\nThe simplicity of the metric tensor compared to the complexity of the frame is striking. The point is that we can more easily visualize the caustics formed by the relative motion of our observers in the new chart. The integral curves of the timelike unit geodesic vector field formula_35 give the world lines of our observers. In the Rosen chart, these appear as vertical coordinate lines, since that chart is comoving.\n\nTo understand how this situation appears in the Brinkmann chart, notice that when is large, our timelike geodesic unit vector field becomes approximately\n\nSuppressing the last term, we have\n\nWe immediately obtain an integral curve which exhibits sinusoidal expansion and reconvergence cycles. See the figure, in which time is running vertically and we use the radial symmetry to suppress one spatial dimension. This figure shows why there is a coordinate singularity in the Rosen chart; the observers must actually pass by one another at regular intervals, which is obviously incompatible with the comoving property, so the chart breaks down at these places. Note that this figure \"incorrectly\" suggests that one observer is the 'center of attraction', as it were, but in fact \"they are all completely equivalent\", due to the large symmetry group of this spacetime. Note too that the broadly sinusoidal relative motion of our observers is fully consistent with the behavior of the expansion tensor (with respect to the frame field corresponding to our family of observers) which was noted above.\n\nIt is worth noting that these somewhat tricky points confused no less a figure than Albert Einstein in his 1937 paper on gravitational waves (written long before the modern mathematical machinery used here was widely appreciated in physics).\n\nThus, in the Brinkmann chart, the world lines of our observers, in the shortwave case, are periodic curves which have the form of sinusoidals with period formula_38, modulated by much smaller sinusoidal perturbations in the null direction and having a much shorter period, formula_39. The observers periodically expand and recollapse transversely to the direct of propagation; this motion is modulated by short period small amplitude perturbations.\n\nComparing our exact solution with the usual monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave as treated in special relativity (i.e., as a wave in flat spacetime, neglecting the gravitational effects of the energy of the electromagnetic field), we see that the striking new feature in general relativity is the expansion and collapse cycles experienced by our observers, which we can put down to \"background curvature\", not any measurements made over short times and distances (on the order of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation).\n\n\n"}

The stadium was the home of the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, a Triple-A Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League from 1988 to 2018. Beginning in 2019, it hosts the Rocky Mountain Vibes of the Pioneer League.\n\nBefore the completion of Sky Sox Stadium, the Sky Sox played at Spurgeon Stadium, a public field at Memorial Park in downtown Colorado Springs which had hosted the original Sky Sox. Sky Sox Stadium opened late for the 1988 season at a cost of $3.4 million and remained the home of the Sky Sox until their 2018 departure.\n\nThe Sky Sox won Pacific Coast League championships in 1992 and 1995, and attendance was generally good; however, at the end of the 2004 season, facing declining turnout and an assortment of problems that showed the ballpark's age (capped by the center-field scoreboard, on which the ball, strike, and out indicators were non-functional), team executives decided to renovate the ballpark. Changes included an improved sound system, a more modern scoreboard with video screen, a new walkway leading to the gates, a banquet facility at the end of the right field concourse, and a readout in the right field wall displaying the speed of each pitch.\n\nAlong with these changes, the park's naming rights were sold to Security Service Federal Credit Union. The naming rights deal expired after the 2018 season, and on May 8, 2019, it was announced that UCHealth, as part of a sponsorship deal with the Vibes, had purchased the naming rights to the field, giving it its current UCHealth Park name.\n\nThe current attendance record was set on July 4, 2004 when the Sky Sox lost to the Omaha Royals 6–5 in front of 9,505 fans.\n\nThe names of some of the great players in Sky Sox history ring the upper deck. Known as the members of the Sky Sox Hall of Fame, they are Luis Medina (played 1988–1991), Sam Hairston (played 1950–1956), Charlie Manuel (managed 1990–1992), Alan Cockrell (played 1990, 1992, 1994–1996), Norm \"Bulldog\" Coleman (non-player who helped the Sky Sox succeed financially, inducted 1996), Ryan Hawblitzel (played 1993–1996), Trenidad Hubbard (played 1993–1996), and Brad Mills (managed 1993–1996). All historical players have their jerseys retired and statistics shown in the Hall of Fame Bar & Grill located within UCHealth Park.\n\nUCHealth Park is 6,531 feet above sea level, making it the highest professional baseball park in North America. The stadium faces east, toward the plains and the Springs Ranch housing development, meaning that fans cannot see the Rocky Mountains to the west. This is due to the fact the sun sets over the mountains and would be a distraction to batters if the stadium faced west.\n\nCovering most of the first base line is the Coors VIP Picnic Terrace. It holds nearly a thousand people and is the site of many weddings and other special occasions. At the end of the right field foul line, there is an 8-person hot tub that is recognized as \"The Highest Hot Tub in Professional Sports\". Guests are served champagne and acknowledged on the main display.\n\n"}

His voice actor was Arihiro Hase. After the death of Arihiro Hase in 1996, he was voiced by Kenji Nojima in the PlayStation 2 \"Macross\" video game from 2003.\n\nThe original animation and the distributors Bandai Visual and Victor Entertainment romanizes his name as \"Hikaru Ichijyo,\" while AnimEigo and ADV Films also use \"Hikaru Ichijo\" and \"Hikaro Ichijo\".\n\nAccording to the fictional continuity of \"Macross\", Hikaru Ichijyo is Japanese. Hikaru grew up with his father as a talented aerobatic flier, having won seven amateur flying contests by the age of 16 in 2009. When his \"senpai\" Roy Föcker invited him to the launch ceremony of the SDF-1 Macross he found himself pulled into a galactic war against an alien race called the Zentradi. He later joins the UN Spacy after a talk with Föcker and Lynn Minmay. Shortly after joining, he gains a reputation as a skilled pilot and leader, and he is promoted to second lieutenant and later first lieutenant. He pilots the VF-1S Valkyrie \"Skull One\" after the death of Föcker, and is eventually promoted to captain at the end of the series.\n\nHis personal feelings tend toward two women: his friend-turned-idol Japanese-Chinese girl Lynn Minmay, and Misa Hayase. While initially growing feelings for Minmay, he also begins to grow a fondness for Misa throughout the series. The relationship between Hikaru and Misa slowly evolved throughout the series. In the beginning, they had a difficult superior-subordinate relationship, starting with Hikaru calling Misa \"old woman\" (\"obasan\") when he saw her for the first time on his Valkyrie's screen. However, the intensity of their relationship gradually softened after going through a series of crises and intimate moments together: Hikaru rescued Misa from the Mars base before the base exploded (Episode 7: Bye Bye Mars); they had their first \"mission kiss\" while demonstrating \"Protoculture\" to the Zentradi people (Episode 11: First Contact) and later managed to escape together (Episode 12: Big Escape); they accidentally shared an evening together while trapped in the transformed Macross and revealed to each other their respective lovelorn stories (Episode 21: Micro Cosmo).\n\nWhile they were still unsure of their own feelings, both felt deep loneliness after Misa departed Macross to Earth, trying to persuade the United Government to enter peace negotiations with the Zentradi troops. Clumsy at communicating his feelings, Hikaru sent Misa the message \"Wish you return to Macross safely\" using the Morse code (Episode 24: Goodbye, Girl).\n\nAt the end of the Space War I, Hikaru ventured into the ruined Alaska base on Earth and rescued the sole survivor Misa. After their reunion, Hikaru told Misa that even though they were probably the only survivors on earth, he was happy as long as the partner was Misa (Episode 27: Love Flows By).\n\nAfter Space War I, Hikaru spent 6 months on the Apollo base on the moon as a test pilot for one of the first prototypes of the VF-4 Lightning III variable fighter set to replace the VF-1 Valkyrie.\n\nAfter he returned to Earth (Episodes 29 to 36), the love triangle of Misa-Hikaru-Minmay underwent many turns due to Hikaru's inability to be frank with his own feelings. As a result, Misa was deeply hurt by Hikaru's lingering feeling for Lynn Minmay. However, Hikaru eventually realized that he could not live without Misa after the heartbroken Misa confessed her love for him while bidding farewell to him.\n\nThe two got married on October 10, 2011 and their first daughter Ichijo Miku was born a year later.\n\nIn 2012, Misa and Hikaru were appointed as the Commander of the new \"SDF-2 Megaroad-01\" ship and the Capitan of the ship's escorting Valkyrie group, inaugurating the space colonization chapter in the Macross history.\n\nIn 2016, Megaroad-01 lost contact with Earth and Misa, Hikaru, Miku and the ship's crew and citizens (including Lynn Minmay, who remained as their friend and also boarded the ship) were declared missing.\n\nWhen \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" series was adapted into the of the 1985 American animated series \"Robotech\", Ichijyo was renamed \"Rick Hunter\" and went through numerous changes to fit into the \"Robotech\" canon. While the original Japanese series featured a Japanese Ichijyo, Hunter was instead an American who grew up in California. Roy Fokker, a childhood friend of Ichijyo in the original series, has since been retconned into Hunter's literal brother – adopted by Hunter's father after the death of Fokker's real father.\n\nHunter and Ichijyo both have separate canon about their lives after the end of their initial series. By possible coincidence, these are slightly similar. In the spin-off film \"\", Ichijo is seen departing with his wife on an interstellar expedition on the SDF-2 Megaroad-01. Hunter and his wife, Lisa Hayes, make a similar trip in \"\", wherein they depart the Earth in search for the home world of the Robotech Masters on board the SDF-3. While \"Robotech II\" was released one year after \"Flash Back 2012\", \"The Sentinels\" had been in production for years before the music video collection. While the official Macross canon has the crew of the Megaroad disappearing four years into their mission, animated and printed \"Robotech\" material has shown Hunter's expedition failing in a different light – being stranded at Tirol and failing to protect Earth from the Masters or the Invid. After the Invid invade, Hunter leads the fleet against the reclaiming of Earth.\n\nHikaru Ichijyo's legacy within the ongoing future history of the Macross series has been a palpable presence. Both the \"Macross 7\" and the \"Macross Frontier\" anime television series contains numerous references to Ichijyo's career on the SDF-1.\n\nIn \"Macross 7\", the Macross 7 fleet enact a play entitled \"Do You Remember love?\", which retells the events of \"\" (which is revealed to be a film within the \"Macross\" universe retelling the events of the First Space War). Basara Nekki, the main character of the \"Macross 7\" TV series, plays the role of Hikaru Ichijyo in the film. \n\nIn \"Macross Frontier\", the Mihoshi Academy on board the \"Macross Frontier\" has a VF-1S fighter atop the roof. It is revealed at one point to be Ichijyo's first fighter as leader of the Vermilion Squad of Skull Squadron. In \"Macross Frontier\", Alto Saotome, as most junior pilot of S.M.S.'s Skull Platoon (a similar position to Ichijyo's), has his VF-25 Messiah fighter decorated in the same colors as Hikaru's VF-1A (and later S) from \"Macross: Do You Remember Love\".\n\n"}
