Signed to Def Jam Recordings since 2004, his major label debut \"\" was released the following year and debuted at #2 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 172,000 copies in its first week and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Jeezy is credited, along with fellow Atlanta-based rappers T.I. and Gucci Mane, for helping to pioneer and popularize trap music with a mainstream audience.\n\nJeezy began his music career in 2001 as Lil J with the release of \"Thuggin' Under the Influence (T.U.I.)\". In total, Jeezy has released ten studio albums, as well as numerous successful singles, including the top ten hit \"Soul Survivor\", featuring Akon, as well as the top 40 hits \"I Luv It\", \"Go Getta\" featuring R. Kelly, and \"Put On\" featuring Kanye West. Along with his own singles, Jeezy has also been featured on numerous hip hop and R&B hit singles, including \"Say I\" by Christina Milian, \"I'm So Paid\" by Akon, \"Hard\" by Rihanna and \"Love in This Club\" by Usher, the latter of which reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, in 2008.\n\nOutside of his solo career, Jeezy is also the \"de facto\" leader of the southern hip hop group United Streets Dopeboyz of America (U.S.D.A), and a former member of the Bad Boy Records' rap group Boyz n da Hood.\n\nJay Wayne Jenkins was born on September 28, 1977 in Columbia, South Carolina. When he was a toddler, Jenkins relocated to Atlanta, Georgia where he lived with different family members, as a result of his parents separating. In an interview with \"XXL\" magazine, he described his childhood as \"empty\". At a point in time he lived in Hawkinsville, Georgia at 600 N Lumpkin. He had lived in Macon, Georgia at an older age where he befriended many Crip gang members and even affiliated himself with the Crips and started his affiliation with Kinky B who helped his career along with many others.\n\nIn 1994, Jeezy spent nine months in YCA (Youth Challenge Academy), a boot camp in Fort Stewart, Georgia, for narcotics possession. Four years later, in 1998, Jeezy launched the label imprint CTE World, then known as Corporate Thugz Entertainment.\n\nIn 2001, under the name Lil J, Young Jeezy released his first independent album, \"Thuggin' Under the Influence (T.U.I.)\". The album included features from artists Freddy J., Kinky B, Fidank, and Lil Jon, who also produced some of the songs. In 2003, Jeezy independently released \"Come Shop wit Me\", a two-CD set featuring new tracks along with some songs previously released on \"T.U.I\"\".\" In 2004, Jeezy signed with Bad Boy Records and joined the group Boyz n da Hood, whose self-titled album was released in June 2005 and peaked at #5 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart.\n\nIn May 2004, Jazze Pha's manager, Henry 'Noonie' Lee, showed Jeezy's demo to his friend Shakir Stewart, then Vice President Artist and Repertoire (VP A&R) at Def Jam. Stewart \"fell in love with it [the demo] the first time [he] heard it\" and took it to L.A. Reid. Reid recognized Jeezy's talent and gave Stewart the green light to sign him. However, due to Jeezy's rising popularity, other record labels began pursuing him simultaneously to sign with them, most notably, Warner and Interscope. Ultimately, Jeezy decided he wanted to be in business with Stewart and Reid and signed with Def Jam Records as a result.\n\nJeezy released his major label debut, \"\", on July 26, 2005. The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, selling 172,000 copies in its first week and was later certified Platinum by the RIAA. The debut single off his debut album, \"And Then What\" featured Mannie Fresh and reached #67 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The second single off the album, \"Soul Survivor\" featuring Akon, reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and would become Jeezy's highest-charting single of his career. The third single, \"My Hood\", reached #77 on the Billboard Hot 100. In an interview with HitQuarters, A&R Shakir Stewart said that Jeezy had recorded over 60 songs for the album.\n\nIn interviews and on several records, Jeezy has affirmed his resistance to commercialism in his music. According to Jeezy, maintaining his street credibility, is of the utmost concern to him as an artist. In 2005, Jeezy was featured in several popular hip hop songs including Gucci Mane's \"Icy\" and Boyz n da Hood's \"Dem Boyz\". Although, he would later leave the group after having successfully established himself as a solo artist.\n\nIn 2006, Jeezy was featured in Christina Milian's single \"Say I\". Later that year, on December 12, he released his second major label album, \"The Inspiration\". It topped the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 352,000 copies and would go on to be certified Platinum by the RIAA. The album's first single \"I Luv It\" peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the second single, \"Go Getta\" featuring R. Kelly, peaked at #18.\n\nJeezy also extended himself into gaming, portraying himself in the 3D hip-hop fighting game \",\" released in March 2007.

The series presented 1,000 toys for 1,000 kids at various locations in Macon and Atlanta. The CTE Christmas Kickoff portion of the event ran from 10 pm to 5 am at Club Miami. The toy giveaway took place in the Unionville neighborhood of Macon and at the Old Fourth Ward Community in Atlanta.\n\nOn September 2, 2008 Jeezy released \"The Recession\", his third studio album and, what would be, his second consecutive number one album. It topped the Billboard 200, selling 260,000 copies in its first week and was later certified gold by the RIAA. The album's lead single, \"Put On\", featured Kanye West and reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. T\"he Recession\" also earned Jeezy a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap performance by a duo. Other singles off the album included \"Vacation\", \"Crazy World\", \"My President\" featuring Nas, and \"Who Dat\" featuring Shawty Redd. Separately, Jeezy made appearances on Usher's \"Love in This Club\" and Akon's \"I'm So Paid\" which also with Lil Wayne. \"Love in This Club\" peaked at #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Later, Jeezy performed on Ciara's single \"Never Ever\", from her album \"Fantasy Ride\".\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Jeezy was at the center of a controversy over his choice for president. While he had previously endorsed Barack Obama, during an interview with \"Vibe\", Jeezy spoke about meeting and supporting John McCain. The statement caused a stir, and Jeezy quickly clarified his stance via a viral video. In the four-minute explanation, Jeezy made it clear, Obama was his main choice. \"I represent the Democratic party. ... I've never been nor do I ever plan to be a John McCain supporter\", the rapper said. \"I support Barack Obama.\" Jeezy and Jay-Z performed in a concert to celebrate the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 18, 2009. On \"The O'Reilly Factor\", commentator Bill O'Reilly criticized their performance as a \"rant that offended people\", but Jeezy responded: \"I got white friends. It's nothing like that. I'm a taxpayer, I got a right to voice my opinion at any point in time. I don't think he really understands my struggle.\"\n\nIt was announced on November 2009 that Jeezy started working on \"Thug Motivation 103\". In March 2010, it was reported that Young Jeezy dropped \"Young\" from his stage name. Later, Young Jeezy denied the name change and claimed it was just a rumor: However, on the cover for his single \"Lose My Mind\", his name is printed as \"Jeezy\". \"Lose My Mind\" peaked at #35 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn March 4, 2010, Jeezy released \"Illin\", featuring Clipse, more specifically, Pusha T. On the track Pusha T raps, \"No amount of record sales could derail this ...Stuffing dead prezzies in the wall like that Yale bitch...\" The line was controversial as many felt the line was in bad taste. Here Jeezy is alluding to Yale student Annie Le, who was murdered in 2009. Many felt Young Jeezy was making light of Le's tragic death.\n\nNearly two years after first announcing work on \"Thug Motivation 103\", on May 17, 2011, Jeezy released the first single off \"Thug Motivation 103\", \"Ballin\", which features Lil Wayne and peaked at #57 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.

The character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 27 January 1986, when Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) drove past her in his van and accidentally splashed her while she was waiting for a bus.\n\nAs of 2020, Sally has been on the show for 34 years, making her the ninth longest-running character on the show.\n\nShe is protective of her two daughters Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) and Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Her notable storylines have seen her have an on-and-off relationship and marriage with Kevin, becoming the victim of domestic violence by Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington), being diagnosed with breast cancer as well as her attempts to become the pillar of the community and annoy Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) in the process. Over the years, she has tried to impress her bosses Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley), Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) and Carla Connor (Alison King) and gain promotions. Sally also embarks on a relationship with Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) and goes on to marry him, survives a minibus crash, begins a political career on the local council and later progresses to become the Mayor, becomes the victim of an internet troll, is wrongfully imprisoned for fraud and is injured when the roof collapses at the factory.\n\nOut in the van, Kevin goes through a puddle and splashes pedestrian Sally Seddon. She is furious as she's on her way to a job interview. He takes her back to No.13 to dry off. Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) has heard of the Seddons and shows her dislike of her. Kevin goes on a date with Sally. Kevin is annoyed when Hilda keeps on about how unsuitable Sally is compared to Michelle Robinson, Kevin takes Sally to tea at No.13 so Hilda can get to know her. When Sally makes an insulting comment about Eddie Yeats (Geoffrey Hughes), they are soon shouting at each other. Hilda asks Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro) and Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) to try to get Kevin away from Sally by taking him on a lads' night out. Kevin introduces Sally to the lads; they think she's fantastic. Hilda does her best to stop Kevin from seeing Sally. Sally tells Hilda that she has no right to be so protective of Kevin; she's not his mother. Kevin gets annoyed when Sally keeps standing him up and missing dates. Hilda tells Kevin that she's seen Sally with a man. He is distraught, accuses Hilda of lying and slams out of the house. Sally confesses that she was out with another lad; it was Alex, her ex-boyfriend. She saw him to make sure that he knew that they were finished. Kevin feels a bit better. Hilda fears that Kevin is gone for good. Hilda is pleased when Kevin returns. He apologises about his behaviour. She doesn't mind but is annoyed to find that he's still seeing Sally.\n\nTerry takes Sally on to run the office at the Builder's Yard at £1 an hour. Curly thinks that it's a bad move. Sally decides to continue claiming the dole despite having this new job. Kevin doesn't like the idea of Sally working with Terry. Curly has nobody to take to Susan Barlow (Wendy Jane Walker)'s twenty-first so Sally offers to set him up with her friend Lois Fairhurst. Kevin doesn't like the way Sally flirts with Terry. Sally is thrilled when Terry kisses her. Kevin is furious when Terry tells him that Sally is fair game. Kevin warns him to keep his hands off her. Sally enjoys canoodling with Terry in the Yard whilst continuing to see Kevin. Curly is upset at the way Terry is mucking around with Sally. He asks Terry to lay off but Terry laughs it off, threatening to thump him if he doesn't keep his mouth shut. Kevin calls at the Yard and finds Sally and Terry together. He goes for Terry, hitting him. They fight in the Yard. Terry sports a black eye, having come out of the fight worse. Sally refuses to take the blame for the fight; it's not her fault if lads get jealous over her. Kevin is upset that he's finished with Sally and upset that he couldn't trust his friends. Terry tires of hearing people talking about Kevin giving him a pasting. He rows with him, wanting another fight but Hilda stops them and lectures them on the value of friendship. Sally begins to find Terry a bit ignorant. Sally tells Kevin that she's sorry she went out with Terry. She tells him she wants to go out with him and she swears that she is serious about him. Kevin is pleased. Kevin is set upon by Terry and Sally to hold a party at No.13. Sally tells Kevin that she's going to spend the night with him. Sally has spent the night with Kevin at No.13. Sally is upset when her mother throws her out after discovering that she spent the night with a man. Kevin takes her in. With Hilda returning, Sally clears her things out of No.13. Hilda returns from Torquay. Kevin explains that Sally is homeless. Hilda is forced to let Sally stay when Kevin threatens to leave and walk the streets with Sally. Hilda learns that Sally has been staying at No.13 during her absence.\n\nHilda tells Kevin that Sally must leave, immediately; they've misused her house. Elsie Seddon (Brenda Elder) tracks Sally down and demands she hand over her dole money so she can buy husband Eddie (James Duggan) beer. Hilda witnesses this and is shocked that the Seddons care so little for Sally. Hilda tells Sally she can stay until she finds somewhere else to live; she doesn't want Sally to have to live with her father. Hilda doesn't like leaving Sally and Kevin alone at No.13 and monitors their every move. Hilda refuses to accept housekeeping money from Sally, feeling it would bind her legally. Kevin tells Sally he wants to move into a flat with her – she is delighted. Hilda is mortified at the thought of Kevin and Sally living together. Kevin and Sally go to Sheffield for an all-night pop concert. Kevin and Sally return at 5.30 am from Sheffield. They spot smoke coming out of the Rovers' door. Sally wakes the residents whilst Kevin tries to wake Bet. Hilda knows Sally and Kevin are spending their nights together. Hilda lays a trap for Sally on the stairs. She forgets about it and falls down the stairs herself. Sally and Kevin marry in 1986 and buy No.13 from Hilda when she leaves the area to become housekeeper to Dr. Lowther in Derbyshire.\n\nIn 1990, Sally gets pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl in the back of Don Brennan's (Geoffrey Hinsliff) taxi on Christmas Eve. She names the baby Rosie (Emma Collinge, Helen Flanagan) because the taxi is parked on Rosamund Street. Sally falls pregnant again in 1994 and \"Lauren\" (Ashleigh Middleton, Emma Woodward, Brooke Vincent) is born in early November. The name \"Lauren\" does not last as Rosie always calls her younger sister Sophie, so she and Kevin change her name to Sophie. Sally also decides to go back to work, getting a job at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) factory in 1996.\n\nSally's mother has a stroke in 1997 and Sally goes to Scarborough to look after her. This makes Kevin feel neglected and begins an affair with his business partner, Natalie Horrocks (Denise Welch). When Sally returns to Weatherfield, she knows that something is wrong, and eventually catches Kevin and Natalie in bed together. Sally throws Kevin out and he moves in with Natalie. Angry, Sally gets mechanic Chris Collins (Matthew Marsden) to let her into Natalie's house and promptly floods it. Natalie threatens Sally with legal action, causing them to fight in the Street.\n\nSally has a brief fling with Chris Collins but eventually forgives Kevin and by Christmas 1997, the Websters are reunited. In 1999, she has an affair with Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington). Kevin finds out and he throws Sally out so she moves in with Greg and they agree on a divorce, but not custody of the girls. Greg hits Sally after an argument and she leaves him, asking Kevin to take the girls as Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) does not have room for all of them but when she rents number 6, Kevin refuses to let the girls move in with her. So she takes him to court for custody and wins. Kevin, however, takes this badly and disappears, returning six weeks later, having had a breakdown.\n\nOn the eve of Kevin's wedding to Alison Wakefield (Naomi Radcliffe), Sally sleeps with Kevin. In 2001, the couple plan to wed, but Kevin becomes more and more jealous. He vanishes, making Sally worry about his whereabouts. Kevin turns up at Sally's hen night and says that he still loves her. Sally later confesses to her fiancé, Danny Hargreaves (Richard Standing), that she and Kevin slept together on the eve of his wedding to Alison, and Danny leaves her and the Street. In 2002, Sally suggests to Kevin that he move back into Number 13 and they remarry later that year.\n\nSally, looking for something challenging in the employment stakes, takes a job as a personal assistant to prosperous garage owner, Ian Davenport (Philip Bretherton). They met at a local private school, Oakhill, as Rosie is friends with Ian's daughter. Unfortunately, she takes the fling more seriously than him as he sees her simply as one in a long succession of women. When he finishes with her, she is bitter and resentful as she risked her family for a fling and it stings even more because Kevin knows Sally was unfaithful but is willing to overlook it. Sally turns her ambitions to her daughter, Rosie. When Rosie shows an interest in being a pop star, Sally pushes her onto the stage where she is miserable. In a particularly humorous event, Sally is indignant when Ken Barlow (William Roache) misspells Rosie's name in a review of her school show. She is unhappy about Rosie dating Craig Harris (Richard Fleeshman), a local lad whose family has a past, (too much like her own). When she learns that they are sleeping together, she drags to Rosie to the doctor and is disappointed that he praises Rosie for being sensible enough to take precautions. Sally's emotions and nerves crumble as she takes Rosie on a wild drive across the M62 en route to a boarding school but loses control of the car, almost killing them both. Kevin catches up and cradles his wife, who admits she is disappointed with life in a back street, saying she just wanted more for her children than she had.\n\nIn 2007, Sally decides to take an A-Level in English literature and has private lessons with John Stape (Graeme Hawley). Sally becomes obsessed with John, making Fiz (Jennie McAlpine) (John's girlfriend) jealous. This leads to a misunderstanding when Sally gets something in her eye and John tries to remove it just as Fiz and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) enter the factory. As they are standing so close together, Fiz thinks that they are kissing and slaps Sally. Fiz is right about Sally's feelings for John and Sally eventually tells John how she feels but he lets her down gently, as he is having an affair with Rosie instead. This is revealed on Christmas Day that year when John accidentally gives Fiz and Rosie the wrong presents.\n\nIn 2008 the Websters swap houses with the Peacocks who are having financial difficulties and move into Number 4. Following the move, Sally becomes extremely house-proud, frequently boasting about the house's conservatory and size compared to other houses on the street.\n\nIn 2009, Kevin develops feelings for Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), wife of his employee/friend, Tyrone (Alan Halsall). Molly takes an interest in the business and shares the bookkeeping with Sally, spending more time with Kevin. Eventually, he tells Molly how he feels. Molly is initially horrified but later tells him that she is flattered and they begin an affair, first sleeping together when Kevin sneaks away from Sally's birthday party. Afterwards, Kevin feels guilty and decides to end it before it gets out of hand by persuading Tyrone to take Molly on holiday. They resume the affair in August, agreeing to tell their respective spouses and leave them but Kevin ends things with Molly instead, after learning that Sally has breast cancer. After breaking the difficult news to Rosie and Sophie, Sally has a lumpectomy to remove the growth, which proves successful. She visits her sister while recovering from her treatment, returning in July, celebrating her birthday with her family.\n\nIn December 2010, Molly admits her affair with Kevin and that he is the father of her son, Jack, named after Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey) by Tyrone. Just after shocking Sally with this revelation, she dies. Sally confronts Kevin and orders him to tell Tyrone and leave. Sally tells Rita and she suggests she move on. Later, Kevin tries to win her back but she's not interested and Rosie and Sophie agree, telling him to leave for good. Sally states seeing him with Jack makes her hate him even more and wants to be rid of them both. After a desperate plea from Sophie, Sally allows him to stay for Christmas Day but on New Year's Eve, Kevin accepts he's not wanted and baby Jack is Tyrone's son and leaves alone. However, Tyrone is equally devastated when he learns about Kevin and Molly's affair and unable to look at Jack now, he gives Jack to Kevin. Sally kisses Tyrone just after the New Year but nothing happens. Although she lies to Kevin, telling him that she wanted to hurt him as he hurt her when he had the affair. This leads to Kevin and Tyrone fighting and Kevin decides to sell the house & freezes all joint bank accounts. Sally tells Kevin that she lied to him about sleeping with Tyrone and they agree to a truce but when Kevin suggests giving their marriage another go and starting a new family, Sally is adamant that she will not have him back.\n\nAfter being fired by Underworld boss Carla Connor (Alison King) because of the company's financial difficulties, Sally complains to Carla's ex-business partner/former fiancé, Frank (Andrew Lancel), who employs her and promotes her to line supervisor. At the same time, her relationship with Rosie's agent, Jeff, ends after the \"Weatherfield Gazette\" publish a story detailing Sally's cancer, Kevin's infidelity, baby Jack and Sophie's sexuality – information provided by Jeff. Sally soon finds herself drawn to Frank and makes it clear that she does not believe Carla's claims that he raped her and the pair form a mutual attraction for one another. However, on 2 March 2012, Sally sees Frank's true colours when his mother tells Sally that Frank does not love her and is having an affair with Jenny Sumner (Niky Wardley). A shocked Sally confronted Frank and he admits the affair and that he did rape Carla, warning her not to cross him as the last woman who did 'lived to regret it'. Sally is devastated by this and Kevin offers her support, threatening to murder Frank and then on 5 March, Sally finds Frank dead in the factory. She is found standing over him with blood on her hands but did not kill him as he was bludgeoned to death with a whiskey bottle. However, due to recent events, Sally is a suspect but she attends his funeral and is puzzled when Anne (Gwen Taylor), Frank's mother, leaves the crematorium, during the service and visits her. Sally finds Anne holding Frank's missing watch, which was missing from his personal possessions on the day he died and she admits having it all along and Sally realises that Anne killed Frank in a fit of rage as she heard him admitting to Carla that he did rape her. A horrified Sally then tries to leave but falls on the stairs, hitting her head on the wooden banister, knocking her unconscious. As Carla and Kevin arrived, an ambulance is called and Anne is arrested. Sally and Kevin begin to rekindle their romance and relationship as Sally realises that she still loves Kevin and he has stood by her regardless. Unfortunately though Sally cannot accept Jack.\n\nWith Kevin away in Germany, Sally begins a relationship with Tim Metcalfe. At first, Tim is put off by Sally planning to book a holiday to France and lies that he has to leave for work reasons. When Tim returns, he prepares to break up with Sally but later reconsiders when he realises he has feelings for her. However, Tim is later unimpressed when Sally leaves his daughter Faye by herself, although Faye and her friend Grace lied about the amount of time Sally left them on their own for.\n\nTim and Sally later get engaged however she kisses Kevin and he finds out. Sally, presumably having a breakdown of some sort still goes to the wedding and Tim eventually turns up after Kevin talked him round. They then married happily in front of the guests.\n\nIn 2017, Sally receives a call from the hospital saying her cancer is back. However, Rosie and Sophie learn that it was a malicious prank call from a person on social media.\n\nAuditions were held for the part of Sally with actress Sally Dynevor (then going by her maiden name of Sally Whittaker) securing the role. Dynevor had previously auditioned twice for two different \"Coronation Street\" characters. The first was the milkman's eldest daughter, and the second a girlfriend of Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). She got neither role, the latter because the girlfriend was meant to be posh. Interviewed for The People's Soap Special, Dynevor spoke about how terrifying her first episode was to film because she had not done any TV work prior to the role and the scene involved one of the show's best known characters, Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander).\n\nSally is described as ambitious, sometimes even arrogant, and is considered by various Street residents (Janice Battersby in particular) to be quite snobby. Such behaviour is apparent in her attempts to live above her station. In the past she has pressured her family to do much of what she tells them. She tried to force her daughter Rosie into a prestigious school; Rosie did not want to go. Another event saw her become envious of a friend's large house.\n\nOnce, in fear of being constantly regarded by her daughters as the \"bad guy\", Sally would intentionally act passive and forgiving whenever the girls acted up, making Kevin out to be the mean, unfair parent when he scolded them for their behaviour. Kevin eventually got his revenge when he and the girls trashed their house while Sally was out. When she returned home and saw the mess, she couldn't keep up her act and became angry, feeling as though her role in the family was unimportant. Kevin told her otherwise, declaring that she always keeps the family in order and on their toes, and that she is genuinely appreciated by all.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with newspaper \"The People\", Sally Dynevor expressed her delight with Sally's ever evolving personality: \"After more than 20 years, I still get the same pang of excitement over a good script as I did when I first joined the show. Sally meddles in everyone else's business and thinks she is so much better than the rest of them but really she is just the same. There aren't many dull moments. Sally is a fabulous character and I know I am so lucky to play her. All those years ago when I started she wasn't like this so I am so pleased that the producers have made her change. It has only been over the last five years that she has turned into a right cow. That is brilliant because it means I can show what I can do as an actress. I know some viewers hate her, others love her, but I am pleased she is talked about. I hope she carries on being like this for a very long time to come.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Woman\" magazine in 2015, Dynevor praised soap writers for reinventing Sally. She said: \"After 29 years in Coronation Street, I feel like I'm 'reinventing' Sally a little bit and I really like that. I've had to change with the times, otherwise I'd have been left behind. I'm getting a lot more comedy now, and Joe Duttine [Tim] and I can't stop laughing – which is great. He's so funny and we work well together.\"\n\nShortly after Sally's arrival in 1986 she was paired with Kevin Webster portrayed by Michael Le Vell and they then went on to get married and have two daughters Rosie and Sophie. Their marriage was on and off a number of times mainly due to either one of them having an affair. In 2009, Kevin went on to have an affair with Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns) resulting in Kevin getting Molly pregnant and her giving birth to a baby boy named Jack. Kevin revealed all to Sally in the Christmas Day 2009 episode; where Sally ended the marriage. In 2011, Le Vell backed a Sally and Kevin reunion stating; \"I think they could definitely get back together, but I don't know when or how they could make it work as long as Sally accepts baby Jack.\" Dynevor added: \"So many people have said it just wouldn't be right if Sally and Kevin weren't together. But I'm sure it would be really difficult for her to accept Jack as her own. Could you do that?\"\n\nIn 2015, Sally was involved in a surprise kiss with Kevin whilst being in a relationship and engaged to Kevin's best friend Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine). Asked if Kevin has feelings for Sally, Le Vell replied: \"He'll always have feelings for her, as they were together for a long time. He'll always love her, but they just hurt each other too many times and too much water has passed under the bridge. Never say never but I think Sally and Tim are a great couple and Kevin enjoys seeing them together as well. They've got that harmonious relationship where he's still got Sally and Sophie in his life and he's got a new best mate in Tim.\" Asked about Kevin's reaction to the kiss Le Vell replied: \"He's in total shock and disbelief. After about five seconds, that is when the realisation sinks in. He does respond at first but then he realises this is wrong. He is genuinely shocked. He knows deep down Sally didn't mean it, it is just a spur of the moment thing. Sally and Kevin do both feel genuinely bad afterwards for Tim because it was something and nothing. Obviously you wouldn't like it if your real life partner did it, but it didn't mean anything and they were married for over 20 years, not that that makes it okay! They're both full of remorse, even though it's not really Kevin's fault, Sally does pounce on him but he still feels guilty.\"\n\nIn September 2009, it was revealed that Sally would fall victim to breast cancer. Speaking of the plot, Dynevor said, \"I do know women who have suffered or are suffering from breast cancer. For the last year, I have been fund-raising for breast cancer charities and am a long-standing patron for The Genesis Appeal. So, when I was told about this storyline I was determined to do it justice for all the women out there who are going through what Sally is. A few years ago, I found a lump and was sent to get it checked out straight away. I was lucky that it proved to be nothing but the time spent waiting to find out the results was agonising.\" A \"Coronation Street\" spokesman added, \"Breast cancer is a disease which affects so many women and their families. We are keen to ensure that the storyline accurately reflects the many problems and issues faced by breast cancer sufferers.\"\n\nIn May 2010 it was revealed that at the same time as her character found out that she had cancer, Dynevor herself discovered that hours after filming Sally's cancer revealing scenes, she was also suffering from the disease. Whittaker explained that she found a lump in her breast while preparing for a storyline in which her character Sally Webster has the disease: \"If I had not been researching this storyline I may not have discovered the lump in my breast and had it looked at so quickly, as a result of the early diagnosis, my treatment has been successful and I am able to return to work next month. This storyline could very well have saved my life.\"\n\nIn 2013, Sally began a relationship with Tim Metcalfe portrayed by (Joe Duttine). Dynevor revealed that even though Sally likes Tim she would like him to make some improvements to his lifestyle and commented on \"ITV\" \"Daybreak\"; \"He's a bit of a commitment-phobe so I'm not sure [what will happen], but he's nice and Sally really likes him. She's trying to change him – manipulate him into what she wants! But he's not having it and he wants to go off down the pub, and doesn't want to spend any romantic weekends with her or anything. He's a real bloke – he wants his tea on the table!\"\n\nDynevor admitted; \"I didn't really want Sally to find someone at first, but I like this relationship because she's not found 'Mr Perfect'. All the other men Sally's been with, I could easily have seen her having long term relationships with them. With Tim, you know there's no way they're going to live happily ever after, they're going to drive each other insane. I like the drama that has to offer.\"\n\nIn 2015, it was revealed that Tim would propose to Sally. Asked how Sally feels about Tim, Dynevor said: \"I think she really loves Tim and she really cares for him but she's hoping she's going to be able to change him into the man she's always wanted to be with.\" Asked how Sally reacts to the proposal Dunevor said: \"It does come out of the blue to Sally. They have spoken about getting married in the past then decided they were happy just to be living together, so it does come as a shock. But I think the fact that he gets down on one knee, he's got the music, he's bought the ring and he does it in front of everybody does mean Sally's thrilled.\"\n\nIn December 2015, it was revealed that producers were lining up a plot which would see Sally team up with her neighbours in a bid to tackle several issues in the area. Sally Dynevor, told \"Inside Soap\": \"There is no sign of Sally's ambition waning – she is going to be taking on local politics in 2016. Tim isn't bothered at all. He just stands behind her, raising eyebrows. But it's a great storyline – we've already started filming it and it has been really fun. Sally has Ken, Norris and Mary on board with her – so I reckon she is going to do quite well!\" Backing the storyline, Dynevor admitted that she is delighted with the direction Sally is going in at the moment. It has been great to have such lovely feedback from everyone,\" she said. \"The scriptwriters are writing so much comedy for Sally right now and I love it – long may it continue.\"\n\nDynevor was nominated in the category of \"Best Actress\" at The British Soap Awards 2011. She won \"Best Comedy Performance\" at The British Soap Awards 2015.\n\nIn February 2006, the storyline involving Sally driving Rosie to a moor and scolding her for her unruly behaviour came under criticism from Winnie Johnson, the mother of Moors Murders victim Keith Bennett due to the scenes being filmed at Saddleworth Moor where her son's body is thought to be buried. Winnie Johnson criticised the storyline stating, \"This is outrageous and plain disgusting. Are they going out of their way to be sick? I lost my son out on those moors but to film a child abduction up there after everything that has happened is a disgrace.\" A \"Coronation Street\" spokesman defended the storyline.\n\n\"Low Culture\" columnist Ruth Deller praised Sally Dynevor's work on the show during 2010: \"It's all too easy to overlook long-term characters as being worthy of praise, but since Sally Dynevor returned to the Street this year, she has been on fire. Name checking Mary Queen of Scots, dishing out incredible one-liners, being the stand-out performer in the live episodes and handling the Sophie/Sian and Kevin/Molly situations perfectly, both actress and character have cemented their place in our collective hearts. People like Sally tend to miss out on soap awards and suchlike because they’re always there, but maybe, just maybe her recent work will be noticed and she’ll get some acknowledgement in the next lot of gongs.\"\n\nA columnist writing for \"TV Buzz\" said that Sally does not \"give a damn\" about what people think of her, because if she did she would have \"fled Weatherfield a long time ago\". They said that during her storyline with Frank, Sally took her \"Miss Independent act a step too far\" by romancing him. A reporter for the \"Western Mail\" branded Sally \"Ms Holier-than-Thou\" and said \"It's a tribute to Sally Dynevor's acting skills that she makes many of us want to reach through the TV, give her a good shake and yell: \"Listen to Carla and Maria!\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2275449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275449", "title": "Hero of Ukraine", "text": "Hero of Ukraine\n\nHero of Ukraine (HOU) (, \"Heroy Ukrayiny\") is the highest national title that can be conferred upon an individual citizen by the President of Ukraine. The title was created in 1998 by President Leonid Kuchma and as of 21 May 2020 the total number of awards is 461. The title is granted to two different order recipients, a civilian Order of State and a military Order of Gold Star. The first foreigner awarded the award was Belarusian Mikhail Zhyzneuski in June 2017.\n\nThe origin of the \"Hero of Ukraine\" award can be traced to the Hero of the Soviet Union (established 16 April 1934) and the Hero of Socialist Labor (27 December 1938), the highest decorations established in the Soviet Union, of which Ukraine was a constituent republic. Most of the recipients of the former title received it for heroic military action (with Soviet cosmonauts being a notable exception), while those awarded the latter were recognized for their contributions to national economy and culture. The awards could be given to the same individual more than once, and only the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet could deprive a recipient of the award once given. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, similar awards were created in the resulting independent countries, including Ukraine.\n\nThe title Hero of Ukraine was created on 23 August 1998 with Edict #944/98 by President Leonid Kuchma. Similar in structure to the titles issued by the Soviet Union, the title is awarded in two distinctions: \"The Order of the Gold Star\" and \"The Order of the State\". Unlike the Soviet awards, Ukrainian law allows a person to receive a title in each distinction only once, although the person may receive both levels in due course. This means that if a holder of the Order of the State performs a heroic action, he or she can be presented with the Order of the Gold Star. Vice versa, if labor achievements of a holder of the Order of the Gold Star are recognized to be of exceptional value to the nation, the recipient can be eligible to receive the Order of the State. Either of the distinctions can be presented posthumously, and a hero may only have his title removed by the president if they are convicted of a serious crime.\n\nTwo medals were created by Ukrainian law to differentiate between the titles. They have several common features; both medals use a ribbon long and wide and are divided equally into two bands along its length, with a blue band on the left and a yellow band on the right, matching the colors of the Ukrainian flag. Connected to the ribbon is a suspension device joined to a medallion, both of which are made out of gold. On both medals, the name of each decoration and the award number are engraved on the reverse side of the medallion.\n\nBelow the ribbon of the Order of the Gold Star, the golden suspension device contains a small engraving of the trident representing the Ukrainian Coat of Arms. The medallion is shaped like a five-pointed star wide from one point to the other, and is set within a wreath of oak leaves. Two smaller five-pointed stars are engraved within the larger star. In contrast, the medallion for the Order of the State has the trident of Prince Volodymyr of Kiev (St. Vladimir) placed on top of a wreath of oak leaves. The size of the medallion is high and wide. There is no special design or symbol engraved on the suspension device. In addition to the formal award, recipients of either level are given a copy for use in public. Only one design of the wearer's copy exists, being modeled after the Soviet hero medal with the red ribbon replaced by a blue and yellow ribbon. The trident, which is used on the coat of arms of Ukraine, is placed in the middle of the star. This medal is made out of non-precious metals and is worn on the wearer's left-hand side above all other decorations.\n\nTwo different regulations were issued by President Kuchma: the edict of 1998 and a new edict in 2002. The edict of 2002 voided the edict of 1998 as it was issued after the law on state awards and confirmed the status of the title in 2000.\n\nThe 1998 edict contained general guidelines about the title. Some of the subjects mentioned were the criteria for receiving each level of the title, who can present the title, and how the medal should be displayed in public. The decree specified the title as being awarded to citizens of Ukraine for heroism and labor achievements. It stipulated that only the president could award the title, though certain other bodies of the Ukrainian Government could recommend people to receive it. The edict also allowed for special benefits, including increased pay, social security, and health care, which heroes could use until their death. The decree also covered the topics of duplicate medals and the display, ownership and storage of the insignia.\n\nThe new 2002 regulations differ only slightly from the original ones. The designs of the medals were not changed, the new edict introduced the measurements of the miniature medal, or the \"wearer's copy\". Article 4 outlines the details on the ownership of the insignia and special procedures for the medals to be displayed in museums.\n\nThe medal, which is presented with the title, is always worn on the left side of a business or suit jacket and is worn above any other medals and decorations awarded by Ukraine. If a person has been awarded both levels of the title then the Order of the Gold Star medal is placed to the right of the Order of the State medal. A copy of the medal, made out of non-precious metals, can be presented to the hero for daily wear that can be substituted with a ribbon bar, measuring x , if wearing the medal is not permitted. Another copy of the decoration, called the miniature badge, is worn above the ribbon bars on the left side of the uniform.\n\nIn order for a person to be awarded the title, a recommendation must be made to the President by the Verkhovna Rada (parliament of Ukraine), the Cabinet of Ukraine (Government of Ukraine), the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Higher Economic Court, the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, ministries and other central executive authorities, the Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblast, Kiev and Sevastopol city state administrations, as well as Commission on state awards and heraldry of the President of Ukraine.\n\nThe recommendations are then sent to the President for consideration, along with a package composed of the details of the nominee's deeds and the recommendations that have been filed on his or her behalf. If the President agrees with the recommendation, he will issue a decree to award the person the title, which includes receiving a medal, miniature badge and certificate at a ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Kiev.\n\nRecipients have been awarded the Hero of Ukraine title for a variety of accomplishments. The first to receive the title — in 1998 – was Borys Paton. He was recognised for studies in metallurgy of electrical welding and has been President of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine since 1962. Other science-related honors were given to Platon Kostyuk, for his work in neurophysiology, and Valerii Kazakov for his work in medicine,\n\nThe title is often awarded to athletes and other sports-related personalities. Vitali Klitschko, a heavyweight boxing champion was given the level \"Order of the Gold Star\" in 2004 as was Andriy Shevchenko, 2004 European Footballer of the Year and two-time winner of the Serie A scoring title. Valeriy Lobanovskyi, the former coach of the football club FC Dynamo Kyiv, died on 13 May 2002 in hospital after he passed out during a game. He was awarded the title two days later \"for his years of service to Ukraine for the development of football inside the nation and also improving national prestige.\"\"\n\nOlympic medalists are also prominent winners. Yana Klochkova, who won gold medals in swimming at the Athens and Sydney Olympic Games was awarded the title \"in recognition of Klochkova's outstanding services to Ukraine and her efforts to build up the country's reputation in the Olympic arena.\"\n\nPeople involved in the arts and literature have also received the award. Renowned Ukrainian composer, Oleksandr Bilash, was awarded in 2001 for \"outstanding personal contribution to the enrichment of the spiritual treasures of the Ukrainian people and many years of fruitful creative activity\". Sofia Rotaru, arguably the best-known popular singer from Ukraine in the former Soviet Union, received her award \"\"for outstanding personal merits in the sphere of art\"\". Writer Pavlo Zahrebelnyi was awarded \"for \"self-sacrifice for Ukraine, and for many years of writing and significant personal contributions toward the enrichment of the national spiritual treasury\"\" in 2004. Writers involved in politics are not excluded either; Georgiy Gongadze a journalist who was kidnapped and murdered in 2000, was awarded in 2005.\n\nBelarusian Mikhail Zhyzneuski became the first foreigner awarded the award in June 2017. Zhyzneuski was one of the first protesters killed during the Euromaidan protests; he was shot dead on 22 January 2014.\n\nFor \"his outstanding historical role in the establishment of the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine, activities aimed at reviving the spirituality of the Ukrainian people, raising the authority of Orthodoxy, establishing ideals of mercy and interfaith harmony\" and because he \"was, is and remains the spiritual leader of the Ukrainian church, the spiritual leader of the Ukrainian people\", Patriarch Filaret received the award on 8 January 2019. On 22 January, on the Ukrainian Unity Day, President Petro Poroshenko handed the medal to Filaret.\n\nThere have been allegations that some members of Kuchma's inner circle, mainly Viktor Medvedchuk, may have masterminded inappropriate awards of Ukrainian decorations and titles, including the Hero of Ukraine title. Police, according to the Associated Press, sent summons to Medvedchuk on 15 July 2005, inviting him for questioning about these awards. Kuchma and Medvedchuk were also questioned on Aleksandr Bartenev's Hero of Ukraine title. Bartenev, known also as \"Major\", an alleged gangster, is currently facing legal charges in Ukraine.\n\nDue to these problems, President Viktor Yushchenko agreed to stop awarding state decorations starting in June 2005 until further notice. This move was announced by Ivan Vasiunyk, the First Deputy Secretary of State, and backed by Ukraine's Commission for Decorations and Heraldry. According to Vasiunyk, forty one people were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2004, with some of the awards being presented during the election period. Vasiunyk said that \"I don't think you know a third of these names\", referring to those who were presented with the hero title that year. The Commission agreed not to strip anyone of their decorations, unless Ukrainian law would permit them to do so. Despite the announcement of suspension in giving out awards, two posthumous titles were awarded in July 2005 to Oles Honchar and Vadym Hetman.\n\nThe decision by Yushchenko, in his last days in office in January 2010, to award World War II Ukrainian nationalist and accused Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera with the Hero of Ukraine caused an uproar in Russia, Poland, and other countries, including Ukraine itself. It was condemned by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and other Jewish groups around the world, Polish President Lech Kaczyński, the Russian Foreign Ministry, Soviet Army veteran groups, and prominent Ukrainian politicians such as Sergei Tigipko and Konstantin Zarudnev. Zarudnev, a MP representing Sevastopol, went as far as burning his Ukrainian passport in protest. At the same time the decree that had given Bandera the award was applauded by Ukrainian nationalists in western Ukraine and by a number of Ukrainian-Americans.\n\nOn 2 April 2010, a district administrative court in Donetsk cancelled the presidential decree that had granted the Hero of Ukraine title to Bandera. Lawyer Vladimir Olentsevych argued in a lawsuit that the title of Hero of Ukraine is the highest state award granted exclusively to citizens of Ukraine. Bandera was not a Ukrainian citizen, as he was in exile after World War II, and was killed in 1959 in Germany before the 1991 Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. For the same reasons the Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals on 21 April 2010 declared unlawful a former Ukrainian President Yuschenko decree of 12 October 2007 to award the Hero of Ukraine title to Roman Shukhevych, the commander of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.\n\nOn 12 August 2010, the High Administrative Court of Ukraine dismissed suits to declare four decrees by President Viktor Yanukovych on awarding the Hero of Ukraine title to Soviet soldiers illegal and cancel them. The filer of these suits stated they were based on the same arguments used by Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals that on 21 April satisfied an appeal that deprived Roman Shukhevych the Hero of Ukraine title, as Shukhevych was not a citizen of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, under Article 16 \"Deprivation of state awards\" Law of Ukraine \"On State Decorations of Ukraine\"\nDeprivation of state awards may be made by the President of Ukraine only if the recipient was convicted for a serious crime on the submission of the court in cases prescribed by law.\nThe above procedure in both cases has not been observed, and therefore the legal consequences of decisions taken by courts, as well as the legitimacy of these decisions is highly controversial. Moreover, adaptation of those cases will create a precedent, in accordance to which several others heroes will be stripped of their titles, among them the liquidators of the Chernobyl disaster, several veterans of World War II and others.\n\nThe \"Bandera's case\" recipients of the award also include Avgustyn Voloshyn, Vasyl Stus, Oleksa Hirnyk, Kuzma Derevyanko, Alexei Berest, Hryhory Kytasty, Valeriy Lobanovskyi and others.\n\n"}

{"id": "2275471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275471", "title": "Bill Tarmey", "text": "Bill Tarmey\n\nBill Tarmey (born William Piddington; formerly William Cleworth-Piddington; 4 April 1941 – 9 November 2012) was an English actor, singer and author, best known for playing Jack Duckworth in the soap opera \"Coronation Street\". First appearing in the role in November 1979, he played it continually from 1983 to 2010.\n\nTarmey was born in Ardwick, Manchester, Lancashire. Shortly after his birth, he moved with his family to live in Bradford, Manchester, where he was also educated. Following the death of his father William in 1944 whilst driving an ambulance at the Battle of Arnhem during the Second World War, his mother Lilian remarried, to Robert Cleworth. Tarmey attended the Bradford Memorial School and the Queens Street School (which became the Philips Park Secondary Modern School). On leaving school, he was apprenticed to his stepfather, who was an asphalt spreader by trade. He also worked in the construction industry for a number of years.\n\nIn 1968, Tarmey gave up his job in the building industry to work as a nightclub singer and entertainer. In order to supplement his income, he took on work as an extra on shows such as \"Coronation Street\", amongst others. Despite suffering a serious heart attack in 1976 and a stroke in 1977, he was eventually offered the role of Jack Duckworth, a character who would go on to become an institution in British soap operas. He underwent quintuple bypass surgery in 1987, and had a pacemaker fitted after suffering a second heart attack in 2002, which was used as a storyline in \"Coronation Street\" to explain his absence. He also developed sleep apnoea, disrupting his breathing while asleep.\n\nTarmey was an extra in the Granada Television adaptation of \"King Lear\" (1983) which starred Laurence Olivier in the title role. He was an accomplished singer and released several albums. Three of them \"A Gift of Love\" (1993), \"Time for Love\" (1994) and \"After Hours\" (1996) appeared in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1992 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel on the set of \"Coronation Street\". He has also appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank.\n\nIn April 2006, when he turned 65, Tarmey announced he was thinking of retiring, which prompted letters of protest from fans. In 2009, he wanted to leave his role in the long-running television series, \"Coronation Street\", due to his multiple health problems, which included severe breathing problems. The show's producers, however, persuaded him to stay until the 50th anniversary, in December of the following year. News of his departure was announced on 9 April 2010. Commenting, he said, \"I've had the most amazing 30 years playing Jack. Because of him I've made fantastic friends and travelled all over the world. I'll be sorry to say goodbye\". Tarmey's departure was pushed forward to the 8 November 2010 episode because of his declining health; in this episode Jack died asleep in his chair in a manner similar to the death of Vera (although Jack had a storyline illness). Tarmey was the second longest serving male actor in the show.\n\nIn a March 2011 interview with Nigel Pivaro Tarmey revealed he also had to leave the series because his son Carl had been diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009.\n\nTarmey's autobiography, \"Jack Duckworth and Me: My Life on the Street and Other Adventures\", was published in 2010.\n\nIn 1955, he met his future wife Ali in the local youth club. The couple married in 1962, and had two children: Carl (1966–2019) and Sara (born 1970). Tarmey suffered from poor health for many years, having a severe heart attack at the age of 35 and also a stroke when he was 36. He had heart bypass surgery twice, once in 1987 and again (following another heart attack) in 2002. He and his wife Ali lived in Ashton-under-Lyne. He also suffered from sleep apnoea due to breathing problems. Despite his multiple health problems, Tarmey refused to quit smoking. In May 2011 Tarmey revealed that he needed to undergo further heart surgery.\n\nA \"Coronation Street\" spokesman confirmed that Tarmey died in Tenerife from a heart attack on the morning of 9 November 2012 at the age of 71.\n\n"}

{"id": "2275475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275475", "title": "Tomb ANB", "text": "Tomb ANB\n\nTomb ANB is a sepulchre located in the west of the necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga', near Thebes, Egypt. It may well have been intended as the burial place of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep I and his mother Ahmose-Nefertari.\n\nThe tomb was initially attributed to Amenhotep I by Howard Carter. In the article he does mention that in the scattered debris of the tomb there are as many inscriptions mentioning Ahmose-Nefertari as there are mentioning Amenhotep I so it may be that both had been buried in the tomb. In Porter and Moss the tomb is attributed to Ahmose-Nefertari based on an argument by Černý.\n\nThe tomb is located on a plateau in the foothills of Dra' Abu el-naga'. The tomb opens up to a deep pit at the entrance. Behind the pit is a gallery extending into the rock. Halfway down the gallery is a chamber on one side and a niche on the other. The gallery ends in a very deep protective well. This feature later became common in royal tombs. The well may have served a double purpose. It would have protected the tomb from floods during the rainy seasons, and provided the royal occupant with an access to the underworld. The protective well has two chambers at the bottom. These chambers may have served as a false tomb to throw off potential robbers. Beyond the well is a second gallery which leads to the burial chamber. This final chamber is rectangular in shape and features two pillars.\n\nA basalt bust of a woman, who may be Ahmose-Nefertari was discovered in the tomb. The statue is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (M.M.A. 21.7.9).\nFragments of stone vessels with inscriptions of Ahmose I, Ahmose-Nefertari and Amenhotep I (M.M.A.21.7.1-8.) where found in the tomb, as well as a fragment inscribed for King Apepi and a daughter named Herti. (M.M.A. 21.7.7)\n\nThe Abbott Papyrus is a record of tomb robberies from the time of Ramesses IX. The tomb of Amenhotep I is mentioned in the papyrus. It was said to have been inspected and found untouched.\n\nCarter goes on to measure the dimensions of the tomb. He included both the descent into the well and the ascent from the well in the length of the tomb and comes to 120 cubits. Thereby claiming that Tomb AN B matches the dimensions of the tomb of Amenhotep I as mentioned in the papyrus. Černý later conjectures that the 'House of Amenhotep of the Garden' is to be identified with the now destroyed temple of Amenhotep I located in Deir-el-Bahari. Given that Amenhotep I's tomb is said to be located to the north of this temple, Černý concluded that the tomb was still to be discovered and should not be equated with Tomb AN B.\n"}

It opened in 1879 and closed in 1929.\n\nIntermediate stations were at Wenhaston, Blythburgh and Walberswick.\n\nThe route closely followed the River Blyth, with Halesworth and Southwold both on the north side, but the longest section, including the intermediate stations, was on the south side. Although the line closed in 1929, its track was still marked and identified on a 1933 Ordnance Survey map. The line was lifted and the equipment was scrapped in 1941 to help with war efforts. Some track can still be found on the harbour branch and a surviving van is at the East Anglia Transport Museum. There is also a surviving (but derelict) coal shed at Blythburgh.\n\nParts of the route from Southwold to Blythburgh are walkable, particularly through woodland known as the Heronry on the south shore of the Blyth estuary. The original footbridge at Southwold was blown up during the war but its pillars now support a footbridge.\n\nSouthwold has had a harbour since at least Saxon times, but its importance as a port began to decline during the 19th century. In an attempt to reverse the declining fortunes of the town, the Corporation promoted it as a holiday resort, where bathing in private was available on the wide beaches. They expected the East Suffolk Railway from to to pass through the town, but it was built further inland, due in part to the underlying geology of the area. Although there was a horse bus service which ran to station once a day, this was not ideal, and a request was made to the railway company for a branch line to Southwold from Halesworth in 1855. The East Suffolk Railway were not prepared to build one, and several similar schemes were proposed over the next 20 years. The Southwold and Halesworth Tramway obtained an Act of Parliament in 1872, with the intention of building a steam tramway between the two towns, using the provisions of the Tramways Act 1870, but they failed to raise sufficient funds, and the project foundered. Still there were calls for a railway, and in October 1875 two public meetings were held. Mr Charles Easton of Easton Hall chaired one in Halesworth, and the Earl of Stradbroke, who lived at Henham Hall, chaired the other in Southwold. Both were local landowners, and they invited a civil engineer called Arthur C. Pain to speak, together with Richard C. Rapier, who was part of the engineering firm of Ransomes & Rapier. Both speakers suggested that a gauge railway would be considerably cheaper to build than a standard gauge one, and the meetings resulted in the formation of the Southwold Railway Company. Colonel Heneage Bagot-Chester was appointed as chairman, the two speakers became engineers, and the secretary was a local solicitor called H R Allen.\n\nThe company obtained an Act of Parliament on 24 July 1876, to allow the line to be constructed. The main line was long, running from Southwold to Halesworth, and two branches were also authorised. A branch at Halesworth linked up with the Blyth Navigation, and there was a link to Blackshore Quay, between Southwold and Walberswick, which was to be long. The company could raise £40,000 in working capital by issuing £10 shares, and also had powers to borrow a further £13,000 by issuing debentures. The gauge of the railway had to be at least , and because the line was covered by the Regulation of Railways Act 1868, it could use a simple signalling system and light earthworks, providing loads were limited and speeds did not exceed . In practice, this meant that journey times between the two termini would be about 30 minutes, and trains were limited to 100 passengers.\n\nFollowing a report by C J Wall, a former manager of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, the gauge of was chosen. This would make the line somewhat more expensive to build, but it was thought that the increased carrying capacity would offset this. A prospectus was published on 3 November 1877, which mentioned that the company had agreed provisional contracts with Charles Chambers of Westminster, who would build the line and stations for £30,000, and with the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works Co, who would supply the locomotives and rolling stock for £4,000. The company suffered upheaval around this time, as Allen, the secretary, resigned due to a conflict of interest, when he found himself representing local landowners in their negotiations with the railway. He was replaced by T H Jellicoe, who was joined on the board by the Mayor of Southwold and R C Rapier. Raising finance proved difficult, and when Chambers declined to enter into a proper contract until they were sure that purchase of the land was certain, most of the board resigned on 5 November 1877. Only Rapier and Bagot-Chester remained, to be joined by a new board, who were not local men, whereas all of the previous board except one had been residents of Halesworth. Board meetings moved to Rapier's London office, and he became chairman on 20 December 1877. Bagot-Chester resigned from the company on 29 January 1879, leaving a board that had no real commitment to the service of the community.\n\nRapier worked energetically on the project, and £5,000 borrowed from the English & Foreign Credit Co enabled purchase of the land to begin. Contracts were re-negotiated, and construction work began on 3 May 1878. Sleepers were bought from Norway, and arrived by ship at Southwold harbour. The rails came from the Tredegar Iron Co, and also arrived at the harbour. Ransomes & Rapier supplied the signalling and switchgear, and a local blacksmith called Charlie List was responsible for much of the ironwork. The completed works were inspected by the Board of Trade on 19 September 1879, and a celebration lunch was held at the Swan Hotel on 23 September. Torrential rain that night caused significant flooding in Suffolk, and the line near Wenhaston Mill was submerged, but the official opening took place on 24 September, and the first train completed a return journey despite the water. Subsequent trains ran between Southwold and Wenhaston, as the flooding worsened. The intermediate stations at Walberswick and Blythburgh were not completed until later.\n\nThe railway was supplied with three locomotives for the opening, built by Sharp, Stewart and Company. They had a 2-4-0 wheel arrangement, and the design was similar to others that the company had supplied for light passenger work. Sharp Stewart also supplied rolling stock, and accepted debentures in part payment, only receiving one-third of the total cost in cash. Construction of the railway had cost £90,000, (), and the company applied to the Board of Trade for authority to raise more capital in 1880. Income from the operation of the trains did not produce enough surplus to keep paying the debenture interest, and in 1883 Sharp Stewart cancelled their arrangement, repossessing locomotive No. 1. The other two locomotives and the rest of the stock were then hired at £150 per year. In 1888, the company was authorised to raise another £10,000 in debentures, which was used to pay the arrears in interest on the existing debentures, and in 1890 enabled them to purchase the stock outright.\n\nIn the first month of operation, the company applied to the Board of Trade for permission to run the line as a light railway and this was granted on 11 March 1880. A maximum speed of was specified, and it was to be worked by one engine in steam. Operation of the swing bridge was achieved using an Annett's key, which was attached to the staff, which the working engine was required to carry. Passenger traffic for the first ten years was fairly static, at around 76,000 journeys per year, but goods traffic doubled to reach 9,000 tons. The next ten years saw a steady increase, with passenger journeys rising to 100,000 by 1900, while 9,000 tons of minerals and 6,000 tons of parcels were carried. In order to cope with the increase, another locomotive was ordered from Sharp Stewart in 1893. It was of a similar design to the originals, but slightly longer, and with a 2-4-2 wheel arrangement. It carried the name \"Southwold\" and the number 1, as its predecessor had done.\n\nNeither of the two branches specified by the original Act were built, due to a lack of funds, and the powers were allowed to lapse. At Halesworth, the single platform had a shelter for the passengers, and was connected to the Great Eastern station by a footbridge. There was a raised timber platform between one of the sidings and a standard gauge siding, where goods were transhipped. In 1908, a passing loop was added at Blythburgh, and train control was managed by having a staff for each section. Many of the trains were mixed goods and passenger workings, with the shunting at intermediate stations adding to the journey time for the passengers. The stock did not have a continuous brake, and although the Board of Trade raised the issue at regular intervals, the railway was always able to point to its clean record for transporting passengers, and somehow managed to avoid having to fit one.\n\nIn 1906 it was announced that the line would be widened from its present narrow gauge to allow carriages and wagons to come direct through from Halesworth. This was not carried out, and the proposal was resurrected again in 1920.\n\nThe railway closed on 11 April 1929 and the LNER instituted a bus service between Halesworth and Southwold as a replacement. In 1940 Southwold Council recommended to the Minister of Supply to confiscate the railway assets for conversion into munitions. The town clerk was receiver for the Southwold Railway Company, but was unable to sell the property without consent of the High Court and an Act of Parliament.\n\nThe Southwold Railway Society was formed in 1994 to:\n\nThe Southwold Railway Trust was established in 2006 with the objective of promoting awareness of the heritage of the Southwold Railway, preserving any remaining artefacts and instigating re-instatement of the railway as a local community and public amenity connecting Southwold to the main line railway at Halesworth.\n\nThe trust submitted a planning application in June 2012 with a view to recreating a new station close to the original station site in Wenhaston. Plans include a new station building based on the design of the original, plus a workshop and visitor centre building. The proposals include the reopening of a section of the original railway towards Blythburgh. Lineside walks and picnic facilities, and the conservation and appreciation of local wildlife are also central to the plans.} The trust hopes to conserve a little piece of this historic and unique railway for current and future generations. \n\nTo haul trains on the reopened line a replica Sharp Stewart steam locomotive, based on the designs of the locomotives that served the railway, is being built by North Bay Railway Engineering Services. The locomotive will be named \"Southwold\" and is expected to be completed in 2021.\n\n\n\n"}

G. Wells. It is this plant that supposedly gives Mars its dull red colour. It is one of the several types of plants brought to Earth possibly accidentally by the invading Martians, but the only one that truly was able to adapt and grow widespread on Earth. When it is exposed to water, it grows and reproduces explosively, flooding the neighboring countryside as it clogs streams and rivers. The narrator mentions near the end of \"The Man on Putney Hill\" that the weed glows purple at night. He tries eating some, but it has a metallic taste. Though it engulfed the native plant life of Earth, it also succumbed to the effects of Earth bacteria.\n\nWells' earlier short story, \"The Crystal Egg\", features a \"dense, red weed\" seen on Mars that also grows heavily on water, in this case a Martian canal.\n\nAs the book has been interpreted as criticism of imperialism, the red weed could symbolize the non-native fauna colonizers introduced to the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. In many cases, these introduced species overwhelmed the native fauna, especially in remote islands.\n\nWells may have been influenced by the theories of Camille Flammarion, who in 1873 claimed that Mars was red due to red vegetation growing on it.\n\nThe red weed is not mentioned in the radio adaptation, and is absent from the 1953 film; however its absence fits in with the retcon established for the TV series follow-up in which the aliens originate from Mor-Tax, a garden planet. Therefore, their means of transforming the planet was actually to conserve and promote Earth's own vegetation. \n\nIn \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds\", the red weed is given a two-part song, with eerie music to signify its slow and threatening growth over the Earth. In the live tour, CGI footage of the red weed portrayed it as a mossy creeper that grew much faster than Wells' original account.\n\nIn Steven Spielberg's 2005 \"War of the Worlds\" film, the presence of the red weed on Earth is intentional. Once they have a strong hold of the planet, the invaders take captured humans and drain their blood, which act as a fertiliser for the red weed, helping it grow and cover the planet. Spielberg did state that these invaders did not come from Mars (the \"Red Planet\"), the script indicates the weed is abundantly present on their world as well, suggesting the two share a superficial resemblance. However, what exactly makes up their red weed, whether it is a natural vegetation or what gives it its colour on their world, is unknown; though the human blood possibly adds to its redness. In one scene, the Tripods used their tentacles to dig fiercely at the ground, which could have been when and how they planted the red weed. It grows so quickly that it can be seen growing, and it can grow on just about anything. It is also stated in the script that the weed is fierce enough to flourish in spite of the conditions that had forced the aliens to find refuge on a new world. But despite its tenacity to survive such a harsh environment, much like in the novel, Earth's pathogens kill the red weed. Crows eat some of the remains and the rest eventually become an ash-like dust which is blown away in the wind.\n\nThe red weed is also depicted in the Timothy Hines film \"H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds\", which is a direct adaptation of the novel. However, it is not featured in any detail, and its presence is nothing more than as a part of the background. In fact, the term \"red weed\" is said only once throughout the film.\n\nThe weed does not appear in the modernised, 2005 The Asylum film \"H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds\" (also entitled \"Invasion\"), but later scenes in the film show a reddish-orange colour scheme, possibly used to adapt the red weed into a more realistic aspect and to resemble the colour of Mars to symbolise the aliens' control over mankind. It is confirmed that no such weed exists by Mars Rover recordings during the opening title sequence, and the surface of the planet seen on the sequel \"\".\n\nIn Stephen Baxter's sequel, \"The Massacre of Mankind\", areas infested with the red weed and sprayed with the black smoke are still barren thirteen years after the 1907 invasion, due to the lingering toxicity. \nIt is also present in the PC game of \"The War of the Worlds\", where it replaces the trees if more Martian buildings and defenses are built in that sector, as well as the mobile game of \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of The Worlds: Minigame Adventure\". In 2012, it received its own Android game called \"Red Weed\", where players try to stop the slimy Red Weed from spreading over the land as it changes every patch of green grass it touches into red tendrils.\n\nIn Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's comic book series \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II\", which deals with the effects of the Martian invasion within a wider fictional context, the red weed is deliberately employed by the Martians as an anti-shipping weapon, in order to prevent Captain Nemo's submarine, the \"Nautilus\", from providing effective resistance to the Martian invasion, after the Invisible Man warns them of the Nautilus' capabilities.\n\nIn the comic sequel to the story, \"Scarlet Traces\", the red weed has been farmed because its oil is the only thing that can lubricate the adapted Martian technology. As one character points out, this suggests that the Martians brought it to Earth on purpose.\n\nIn the 2019 miniseries by the BBC, the red weed manifests after the Martians have died off. Unlike in the novel where it succumbs alongside the Martians to Earth's pathogens; years after the miniseries' initial time frame, the red weed has apparently covered virtually all of Earth (as seen from space), turning the continents bright-red and the oceans dark-red (the character Ogilvy mentions Earth's waters are clogged with the weed), and eliminating biodiversity due to choking Earth's flora and ecosystems. Characters Ogilvy and Amy eventually discover that typhoid \"salmonella\" can kill the weed off, though it's left ambiguous whether or not the solution becomes widespread as the village preacher they take their results to is dismissive. The red weed furthermore sprouts red crystals where it grows. Its effects on Earth's ecosystem also cause the sky to turn red during the day and purple at night, and have rendered the sky permanently hazy.\n"}

{"id": "2275505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275505", "title": "Swaraj", "text": "Swaraj\n\nSwarāj ( \"swa-\" \"self\", \"raj\" \"rule\") can mean generally self-governance or \"self-rule\", and was used synonymously with \"home-rule\" by Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati and later on by Mohandas Gandhi, but the word usually refers to Gandhi's concept for Indian independence from foreign domination. Swaraj lays stress on governance, not by a hierarchical government, but by self governance through individuals and community building. The focus is on political decentralisation. Since this is against the political and social systems followed by Britain, Gandhi's concept of Swaraj advocated India's discarding British political, economic, bureaucratic, legal, military, and educational institutions. S. Satyamurti, Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru were among a contrasting group of Swarajists who laid the foundation for parliamentary democracy in India.\n\nAlthough Gandhi's aim of totally implementing the concepts of Swaraj in India was not achieved, the voluntary work organisations which he founded for this purpose did serve as precursors and role models for people's movements, voluntary organisations, and some of the non-governmental organisations that were subsequently launched in various parts of India. The student movement against oppressive local and central governments, led by Jayaprakash Narayan, Udit Swaraj and the Bhoodan movement, which presaged demands for land reform legislation throughout India, and which ultimately led to India's discarding of the Zamindari system of land tenure and social organisation, were also inspired by the ideas of Swaraj.\n\nSwami Dayanand Saraswati, also known as \"Nāri-Shudra-Vedoddharak Maharshi Dev Dayanand Saraswati founder of the Arya Samaj and a Hindu reformer, defined \"swaraj\" as the \"administration of self\" or \"democracy\". Swami Dayanand Saraswati, beginning with the premise that God had created people free to perform any work they were inclined to choose, then questioned the legitimacy of the foreign British occupation to make the Indian nation slaves on their own land? In the Swami's view, \"swaraj\" was the basis for freedom fighting. Dadabhai Navroji said that he had learnt the word \"swaraj\" from the \"Satyarth Prakash\" of Saraswati.\n\nSwaraj warrants a stateless society. According to Mahatma Gandhi, the overall impact of the state on the people is harmful. He called the state a \"soulless machine\" which, ultimately, does the greatest harm to mankind. The purpose of the state is that it is an instrument of serving the people. But Gandhi feared that in the name of moulding the state into a suitable instrument of serving people, the state would abrogate the rights of the citizens and arrogate to itself the role of grand protector and demand abject acquiescence from them. This would create a paradoxical situation where the citizens would be alienated from the state and at the same time enslaved to it, which, according to Gandhi, was demoralising and dangerous. If Gandhi's close acquaintance with the working of the state apparatus in South Africa and in India strengthened his suspicion of a centralised, monolithic state, his intimate association with the Congress and its leaders confirmed his fears about the corrupting influence of political power and his scepticism about the efficacy of the party systems of power politics (due to which he resigned from the Congress on more than one occasion only to be persuaded back each time) and his study of the British parliamentary systems convinced him that representative democracy was incapable of meting out justice to people.\n\nGandhi thought it necessary to evolve a mechanism to achieve the twin objectives of empowering the people and 'empowering' the state. It was for this that he developed the two pronged strategy of resistance (to the state) and reconstruction (through voluntary and participatory social action).\n\nAlthough the word \"Swaraj\" means self-rule, Gandhi gave it the content of an integral revolution that encompasses all spheres of life: \"At the individual level Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self-assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance.\" Politically, swaraj is self-government and not good government (for Gandhi, good government is no substitute for self-government) and it means a continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it is foreign government or whether it is national. In other words, it is sovereignty of the people based on pure moral authority. Economically, Swaraj means full economic freedom for the toiling millions. And in its fullest sense, Swaraj is much more than freedom from all restraints, it is self-rule, self-restraint, and could be equated with \"moksha\" or salvation.\n\nAdopting Swaraj means implementing a system whereby the state machinery is virtually nil, and the real power directly resides in the hands of people. Gandhi said: \"Power resides in the people, they can use it at any time.\" This philosophy rests inside an individual who has to learn to be master of his own self and spreads upwards to the level of his community which must be dependent only on itself. Gandhi said: \"In such a state (where swaraj is achieved) everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour.\" He summarised the core principle like this: \"It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves.\"\n\nGandhi explained his vision in 1946: \n\nGandhi was undaunted by the task of implementing such a utopian vision in India. He believed that by transforming enough individuals and communities, society at large would change. He said: \"It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore not worth a single thought... Let India live for the true picture, though never realised in its completeness.

After being declared as proscribed by the Government of Pakistan on 28 January 2002, TJP started operating under the new name of Islami Tehrik ().\n\nIt was originally formed in 1979 under the name \"Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Fiqh-e-Jafaria\" (TNFJ) to resist anti-Shia laws (introduced by General Zia ul Haq during his martial law) by the late Mufti Jafar Hussain, the late Lieutenant Colonel Syed Fida Hussain Naqvi and others, and TJP effectively campaigned against Zia-ul-Haq by besieging the President's Secretariat, Islamabad for several days.\n\nAfter the death of Mufti Jafar Hussain TNFH split into two groups named TNFJ-Agha Syed Hamid Ali Shah Moosavi group and TNFJ-Arif Hussaini group respectively due to ideological differences between the two leaders. Arif Hussain Hussaini, a student of Ruhollah Khomeini who led the Iranian Revolution, was the group's leader.\n\nLater in 1988, Arif Hussain Hussaini changed the name of his group from TNFJ-Arif Hussaini group to \"Tehrik-e-Jafaria (TJP)\" while Agha Syed Hamid Ali Shah Moosavi's group retained the name of TNFJ and has been operating under the same name since. The TJP founder, Arif Hussain Hussaini was assassinated in 1988 by unknown attackers; the defunct sectarian group Sipah-e-Sahaba was accused.\n\nArif Hussain Hussaini, the patron-in-chief of the TJP, was shot dead in Peshawar near his mosque/seminary while going to lead the morning prayer on August 5, 1988. Since then, T.J.P. has been led by Hussaini's one of the foremost companions Syed Sajid Ali Naqvi.\n\nFollowing the death of Zia-ul-Haq, support for the TJP fell, as Pakistani Shias went back to pre-Zia-ul-Haq political loyalties, with many no longer feeling under threat. Furthermore, the elections of moderate Benazir Bhutto also gave increased confidence to Shia Muslims and they were no longer under threat and the discrimination ended even though it still exist against the Pakistani Shias.\n\nJafaria Students Organization Pakistan, founded in 1997, is the student wing of TJP.\n\nAccording to TJP, Islam is and was the basic ideology of Pakistan; by deviating this ideology a conspiracy was made to make Pakistan a sectarian state in the period of General Zia-ul-Haq, a dictator. At this stage, the formation of TNFJ was deemed necessary for the failure of this conspiracy.\n\nThe main objective of this organisation was to protect the rights of Shia Muslims of Pakistan and give them a voice in the Parliament of Pakistan. They do not advocate a Shia Islamic state and have cordial relations with Sunni organization including Sunni Ittehad Council, that is why they joined the coalition of religious political parties Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal that won 53 out of 272 elected members in legislative elections held on October 20, 2002.\n\nOn January 12, 2002, the TJP was banned along with three terrorist organizations, by the government of Pakistan.\n\nThe TJP was banned twice by Pervez Musharraf's government and in January 2002, its leaders were arrested. The T.J.P. was banned again on November 5, 2011, while Pakistan's Shias experienced increasing attacks since 2005 by the Pakistani Taliban, Sipah-e-Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jundullah and Jaish-e-Mohammed,\n\nAlthough TJP has been designated as a \"terrorist organisation\", Qazi Hussain Ahmad, a senior member of Pakistani Parliament and the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's oldest Islamist party, says the banned groups have no ties with the militants. He notes that one organization is part of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, the major opposition alliance of religious parties, which also includes Ahmad's group.\n\nIt was a part of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal coalition of Islamist political parties that won 11.3% of the popular vote and 53 out of 272 seats in the legislative elections held on October 20, 2002. In May 2008, it was reported that Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan's emir Qazi Hussain Ahmad was considered heading the six-party Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal. Qazi Hussain Ahmad said that he would consider rejoining the MMA after consulting with the executive council of his party and some other seniors. Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)'s chief Fazl-ur-Rahman had tasked Sajid Naqvi of TJP with contacting Qazi Hussain Ahmad and bringing him round to rejoining the alliance.\n\nTehrik-e-Jafaria Pakistan, also known as \"Tehrik-e-Islami\", should not be confused with a short-lived outfit named \"Tehrik-e-Islami\" that was one of three groups of Pakistani Taliban operating during 2008 in Darra Adam Khel, a semi-tribal area known officially as the Frontier Region of Kohat. The \"Tehrik-e-Islami\" and the Pakistan Taliban became active in the area in mid-2007. The former \"Tehrik-e-Islami\" was founded by a local Afridi tribesman named Muneer Khan, while the \"Islamic Taliban\" was founded by Momin Afridi. The groups later merged and became part of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. Both leaders were killed in a military operation in the area in 2008.\n\n"}

(or Maur), was the first disciple of Saint Benedict of Nursia (512–584). He is mentioned in Saint Gregory the Great's biography of the latter as the first oblate; offered to the monastery by his noble Roman parents as a young boy to be brought up in the monastic life. \n\nFour stories involving Maurus recounted by Gregory formed a pattern for the ideal formation of a Benedictine monk. The most famous of these involved Saint Maurus's rescue of Saint Placidus, a younger boy offered to Saint Benedict at the same time as Saint Maurus. The incident has been reproduced in many medieval and Renaissance paintings. \n\nSaints Maurus and Placidus are venerated together on 5 October.\n\nA long \"Life of St. Maurus\" appeared in the late 9th century, supposedly composed by one of Saint Maurus's 6th-century contemporaries. According to this account, the bishop of Le Mans, in western France, sent a delegation asking Benedict for a group of monks to travel from Benedict's new abbey of Monte Cassino to establish monastic life in France according to the Rule of St. Benedict. The Life recounts the long journey of Saint Maurus and his companions from Italy to France, accompanied by many adventures and miracles as Maurus is transformed from the youthful disciple of Benedict into a powerful, miracle-working holy man in his own right. According to this account, after the great pilgrimage to Francia, Saint Maurus founded Glanfeuil Abbey as the first Benedictine monastery in Gaul. It was located on the south bank of the Loire river, a few miles east of Angers. The nave of its thirteenth-century church and some vineyards remain today (according to tradition, the \"chenin\" grape was first cultivated at this monastery.) \n\nScholars such as Hippolyte Delehaye, believe that this \"Life of Maurus\" is a forgery by the late-9th-century abbot of Glanfeuil, Odo. It was composed, as were many such saints' lives in Carolingian France, to popularize local saints' cults. The bones of Saint Maurus were 'discovered' at Glanfeuil by one of Abbot Odo's immediate predecessors, Abbot Gauzlin, in 845. Gauzlin likely invented or at least strongly promoted the cult of Benedict's disciple, taking advantage of Glanfeuil's proximity to two famous and prosperous Benedictine culture centers of the Loire region: the cult of Saint Benedict's bones at Fleury and that of Saint Scholastica's relics at Le Mans.\n\nMaurus was born c. 510, the son of Equitius, a Roman nobleman. At the age of about twelve, Maurus was entrusted to the care of St. Benedict at Subiaco to be educated. Gregory the Great in the \"Dialogues\" recounts a tale wherein the young oblate Placidus was sent to fetch water from the lake and was carried away by the current. Realizing this, Benedict sent Maurus to rescue the boy. Hurrying to reach Placidus, Maurus ran out upon the water. After bringing Placidus back to shore, Maurus attributed the miracle to the prayers of St. Benedict; the abbot, to his disciple's obedience.\n\nMaurus was ordained a deacon, and subsequently, Benedict, prior to leaving for Monte Cassino, appointed him coadjutor at Subiaco. During his tenure, various miraculous cures were attributed to his prayers. Around 528, Benedict summoned Maurus to join him at Monte Cassino.\n\nAround 543, Innocentius, the Bishop of Mans, sent his vicar, Adenard, to Monte Cassino to request Benedict to send some monks to Gaul. Maurus was dispatched and, during the journey, obtained a number of cures for the sick and injured encountered along the way. Through the generosity of King Theudebert, he founded Glanfeuil Abbey, which he governed for many years. He resigned the abbacy in 581 to spend the remainder of his life in solitude and prayer. The abbey of Glanfeuil, was later called St. Maur-sur-Loire. Maurus died at Glanfeuil Abbey 15 January 584.\n\nMaurus was originally buried in the abbey church at Glanfeuil. When, in 868, Odo and the monks of Glanfeuil were obliged to flee to Paris in the face of Vikings marauding along the Loire, the remains of St. Maurus were translated to the abbey of Saint-Pierre-des-Fossés, later renamed Saint-Maur-des-Fossés. In 1750 the relics were relocated to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where they remained until dispersed by a Parisian mob during the French Revolution. Saint Maurus is still venerated by Benedictine congregations today, many monks adopting his name and dedicating monasteries to his patronage. \n\nThe cult of Saint Maurus slowly spread to monasteries throughout France and by the 11th century had been adopted by Monte Cassino in Italy, along with a revived cult of Saint Placidus. By the late Middle Ages, the cult of Saint Maurus, often associated with that of Saint Placidus, had spread to all Benedictine monasteries. He is the patron of charcoalburners and coppersmiths.\n\nThe Blessing of Saint Maur is customarily bestowed on the sick with a relic of the true Cross, in hopes of assisting to restore their health. Since it is often impossible to have a relic of the True Cross, in 1959, the Sacred Congregation of Rites granted permission to use the medal of St. Benedict in place of the relic of the True Cross to confer the Blessing.\n\nThe Congregation of St. Maur took its name from him. The surname \"Seymour\" is derived from \"Saint Maur\".\n\nIn art, he is depicted as a young man in the garb of a monk, usually holding an abbot's cross or sometimes with a spade (an allusion to the monastery of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, literally \"Saint Maurus of the Ditches\"). Another of Saint Maurus' attributes is a crutch, in reference to his patronage of cripples. He was invoked especially against fever, and also against rheumatism, epilepsy, and gout. He is also sometimes depicted with a scale, a reference to the implement used to measure a monk's daily ration of bread, given to him by Benedict when he left Montecassino for France. The monks of Fossés near Paris (whence the community of Glanfeuil had fled from the Vikings in 868) exhibited this implement throughout the Middle Ages.\n\n\n\n\n"}

However two years later, the character was reintroduced on a regular basis.\n\nIn January 2018, it was announced that Hebden would not be appearing as Norris for a while after suffering a heart attack and his last appearance was in December 2017. His return was confirmed by \"Coronation Street\" in November 2018 and Norris returned on 6 May 2019 for a brief stint. Hebden departed on 7 June 2019 but returned again for Ken Barlow's (William Roache) 80th birthday celebrations on 9 October 2019.

Mavis doesn't want to throw Norris out as he might do Derek's morale some good. Derek tells Mavis that he's sure Norris will help him in his career.\n\nNorris develops a reputation as a fusspot and a busybody, but his inquisitive nature sometimes works to advantage, as when he guessed that serial killer Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) was after Emily Bishop's (Eileen Derbyshire) money and wanted her dead.

He explains that he had won the underwear in a competition and that he has an addiction to competitions. Norris' friend, Mary Taylor (Patti Clare), arrives on the Street; Mary was introduced for this specific storyline as she shares Norris' obsession with entering competitions. Norris initially resents Mary, as she often beats him in competitions, but they quickly become close, and Mary offers Norris a ticket she has won for a Cliff Richard concert. Norris' fellow lodger, Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope), enjoys flirting with Mary but she only has eyes for Norris. When Mary and Norris win a motor home, Norris is pleased, but begins to be concerned about how far Mary wants to take their relationship.\n\nWhen Mary's mother dies, she is able to spend more time with Norris, but he remains unsure about their relationship. She then invites him to accompany her on a world cruise, paid for with her inheritance. Norris agrees but is nervous and is shocked by Rita's engagement to Colin Grimshaw (Edward de Souza), and the two share a poignant moment in The Rovers. Genuinely wishing each other well, it is clear that Norris still harbours thoughts of what might have been.

Norris is left reeling at the news that Ramsay died on the flight; he had an incurable brain tumour, which he never told Norris about. Some of Ramsay's possessions are left to Norris and amongst them is a letter written by their mother, who cruelly rejected Ramsay. Norris is left devastated that he had blamed Ramsay all along. After Ramsay's death, Rita decides to sell up The Kabin. When Norris receives £172,000 from Ramsay's will, he buys The Kabin from Rita.\n\nWhen Norris shows signs of tiredness, Mary suggests that she does some work in the Kabin so he can take a break. She enters a competition for them to win a week at a cottage in the countryside and wins, persuading Norris to come with her. Norris realises that Mary is trying to ensure that he cannot escape and even hears Mary mention the idea of them getting married; a horrific thought for Norris. She then breaks his glasses, leaving him more or less housebound, as his eyesight is quite poor. He attempts to escape from the cottage but Mary tracks him down. Eventually, he contacts the police telling them that Mary is holding him captive. No charges are brought against her, and Norris subsequently makes up with her.\n\nNorris is not pleased when Emily allows Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) and her daughter Amy (Elle Mulvaney) to live with them. When Tracy offers to clean the house for Emily, Norris puts a lock on his bedroom door so that Tracy cannot get into his room. Tracy locks Norris in his room as a joke, and he is annoyed when Amy spills paint on his shoes and tells Emily that he wants Tracy to move out. Emily agrees after Tracy ruins Ernest Bishop's (Stephen Hancock) old dancing shoes, thinking that they belonged to Norris.\n\nNorris becomes supportive to Mary after finding out she was raped in her teenage years and conceived a son, whom her mother forced her to give up. Norris and several residents help Mary find her son Jude Appleton (Paddy Wallace), who turns up to visit her. Mary wants to make contact with Jude again, so her and Norris decide to get married and invite Jude and his wife, Angie (Victoria Ekanoye) and their baby son, George (Romeo Cheetham-Karcz), to the wedding. Norris goes through with the marriage to Mary although Jude and Angie find out they only did it to see them, and the pair of them decide to remain.\n\nNorris went to visit Emily in Edinburgh following her return from Peru. Norris sold The Kabin to Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) and Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill), to the fury of Rita. On 7 June 2019 after a final drink at the Rovers with his friends Norris left Coronation Street for Scotland with Freda Burgess. As the taxi drives away Norris reminisces about his time on the street and say he will miss it and the people on it.\n\nAuditions were held for the part of Norris with actor Malcolm Hebden going on to secure the role. After leaving the series in 1997 Hebden returned to filming with the series in 1999 and has remained on the show to the present day. In 2009 it was noted that the character of Norris has become one of the show's most recognisable characters. Norris was written out along with several other characters as part of a large cast cull in 1997. However, the character was reintroduced two years later in 1999, when he had a more regular role than before. Hebden has said to be surprised by Norris having a fanbase, he said: \"Norris is a very popular character in general though, and he's also very popular with children, which surprises me. I would have thought he'd get on our nerves, but he doesn't.\" He went on to say: \"For some unknown reason, Norris is immensely popular with children, though I never understand why. Is he the granddad they've always wanted to poke fun at? He's always wrong, but most of my letters are from young people, which is lovely. I think they feel safe with him because he's a loser!\".\n\nIn May 2009, it was announced that Patti Clare who plays Mary Taylor had been written out from the soap. A spokesperson for \"Coronation Street\" said: \"The affected actors were all involved in storylines that were due to run for a finite time. If every new character stayed in the show, the Street would be a little crowded to say the least.\" It was then rumored that Clare would be returning; Hebden revealed these rumors were true. Hebden praised Mary and Norris, he said: \"I think when Patti and I get together it's comedy all the way. We love working together which is a good start for comedy. Oddly enough, you can play a love relationship with someone you hate - I've done it - but comedy you can't do. So I love her to death and it helps with the comedy.\" Hebden also revealed that Mary should stay in the soap for good. In September 2009, it was announced Patti Clare was to reprise her role as Mary. A spokesperson confirmed: \"Mary will be back to rekindle her relationship with Norris.\" On 18 February 2010, it was announced that Norris would be held captive by Mary in a \"Misery\"-style storyline, speaking of the storyline a \"Coronation Street\" source told \"The Mirror\": \"Mary convinces herself they are reincarnations of Heathcliffe and Cathy and keeps trying to share his bed. Norris escapes to a phone box. When Mary arrives he tries to run and hide but falls and sprains his ankle. Mary refuses to take him to hospital and returns him to the cottage telling him, 'The more helpless you are the stronger I get'.\n\nOn 5 January 2009, it was announced that former \"Fawlty Towers\" actor Andrew Sachs had been cast in \"Coronation Street\" to play Norris's half-brother, Ramsay Clegg. Sachs said that he had foreseen playing Ramsay five years before: \"Myself and my wife had dreamt up a storyline where I played Norris's brother. We thought it would be great fun if a brother every bit as annoying as Norris turned up and the pair of them wound everyone up.\" Sachs also said that he nearly turned down the role \"because I was too scared. I said to my wife that I didn't think I could do it. Apparently there is very little rehearsal time and I said I wasn't sure I liked the part anyway.\" Asked by \"Digital Spy\" \"What's it been like working with Andrew Sachs for the past few months?\", Malcolm Hebden replied: \"\"It was suggested two or three years ago that Andrew Sachs wanted to be my brother and because we had a change of perhaps two producers in that time, it just got lost in the hundreds of storylines we have. I was talking to our new producer Kim Crowther and said I thought it was a great shame we'd never picked up the Andrew Sachs stuff and she knew nothing of it. She thought it was a great idea and she made it happen. Andrew was very happy to do it.\" He also went on to say: \"I had met Andrew once before and he expressed how keen he was to do it. We got on terribly well. I think it took him a little while to get used to my sense of humour but he did by the time he left! For me, the storyline kicks in once he's dead - that sounds awful - but I was just being dismissive and blocking Ramsay for the first part of the story. I just didn't want anything to do with him. Then Ramsay goes back to Australia and dies on the aeroplane but the fallout is enormous - not just for Norris, but particularly for Emily. She'd become quite fond of Ramsay. He's a civilised man and quite a charming character, whereas Norris isn't. Therefore, I'm going to be terribly unpopular for a little while until Norris realises that he was wrong.\"\n\nOn 23 January 2018, it was reported that Hebden would not be seen onscreen for a short period after last appearing on screen in early December 2017. On 5 July 2018, Hebden revealed that he was recovering from a heart attack and had spent most of the previous December in an induced coma. In October 2018, while appearing on \"This Morning\", Patti Clare who plays Mary Taylor teased a possible return for Norris the following year. On 26 November 2018, \"Coronation Street\" officially confirmed Hebden's return as Norris, although Hebden won't be back on screen until May 2019, the ITV soap told \"Digital Spy\" that everyone is looking forward to his return. His return was described as being like a cameo, and the character will leave again, although the role will be left open for the actor to return.\n\nA trailer for promotion of the \"Coronation Street\" website on ITV, which was released in July 2009 to air on television, portrays Norris as James Bond, using high-tech devices to spy on many of his neighbours, in reference to his character's curiosity to know everyone's business in the street.\n\nMalcolm Hebden was nominated for \"Best Comedy Performance\" for his portrayal of Norris at The British Soap Awards 2002. Hebden was also nominated for \"Funniest Performance\" at the 2010 \"Inside Soap Awards\".\n"}

It was the first Fishbone album to include former Miles Davis music director John Bigham (guitar, keyboards), who joined in 1989 during the \"Truth and Soul\" tour.\n\nFishbone took the rest of 1989 off before beginning to write songs for the follow-up to \"Truth and Soul\". The project was plagued by production delays until November 1990, when the band entered Ocean Way Recording, booking two months of studio time in which to record the album. Fishbone, David Kahne and Dave Jerden produced the album, which includes the singles, \"Fight the Youth\", \"Everyday Sunshine\" and \"Sunless Saturday\".\n\nThe album's title comes from a line in track 3, \"So Many Millions\", which reads \"I cannot get over legitimately, the Reality\nof My Surroundings do not point to the sky\".\n\nThe CD cover shows only John Norwood Fisher, with a larger picture of the band sitting in a living room being visible when the CD cover is unfolded. The vinyl version shows the full band's living-room portrait, spanning both sides of the outer gatefold cover.\n\nWith this album, Fishbone obtained critical and commercial success with a ranking of No. 49 on the \"Billboard\" 200 on May 18, 1991. The album is widely considered by fans and critics as the creative peak of the band. Fishbone experienced a large growth in concert tickets and record sales during this period, making two memorable television appearances: performing \"Sunless Saturday\" and \"Everyday Sunshine\" on \"Saturday Night Live\", and \"Everyday Sunshine\" on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\". (The SNL performance of \"Sunless Saturday\" has been re-edited in reruns. The original television broadcast showed a brief glimpse of Angelo Moore doing a backflip on stage.

It is located on the Gloucester-Newport line. \nThe station is located a mile south of Lydney, and was originally called Lydney Junction, which is now the name of the nearby station on the preserved Dean Forest Railway.\n\nLydney Junction was the name of two separate but adjacent stations on two different railway lines. The Great Western Railway station, which is the one that remains open as Lydney railway station, opened in 1851 on the Gloucester to Chepstow section of the South Wales Railway. To the west of this station, the freight-only line of the Severn and Wye Mineral Railway crossed the GWR line on its north-south route taking coal and iron from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Lydney.\n\nIn 1875, the Severn and Wye started passenger services and built a new terminus station at Lydney Junction for passenger trains to and from Drybrook, near Cinderford. Four years later, this first station was superseded by a new one as the Severn and Wye joined with the Midland Railway in building the Severn Bridge Railway, which linked Lydney across the River Severn with the Midland's Sharpness Branch Line, enabling access for the Forest of Dean minerals to the new and more extensive docks at Sharpness.\n\nThe new Lydney Junction (Severn and Wye) station was linked by a long footbridge to the GWR's station. There were also extensive freight yards in the north-east quadrant between the two lines, and these provided the only rail link between the Severn and Wye and the Great Western lines. The two stations worked closely together, particularly after 1894, when the Severn and Wye Railway was bought by the Great Western and the Midland. Finally, in 1955, under British Railways, the two stations were formally merged into one.\n\nLydney Junction (Severn and Wye) was used as a through-station for passenger services to and from Berkeley Road railway station and over the Severn Railway Bridge. These services either terminated at Lydney Town railway station, which was in the centre of Lydney, or continued on northwards into the Forest of Dean to terminate at Lydbrook Junction on the Ross to Monmouth line. These services ceased abruptly in October 1960 when the Severn Railway Bridge was damaged beyond economic repair in a shipping accident. Passenger services were officially withdrawn from this Lydney Junction in November 1964 and it remained closed until reopening by the Dean Forest Railway in 1995.\n\nThe other Lydney Junction, then renamed Lydney, lost its freight services in 1968 and its staffing in 1969, and the Great Western buildings on the platforms were demolished, though the signalbox remained until December 2012.\n\nThe station is unstaffed, but a self-service ticket machine is provided (this can also be used for collecting advance purchase tickets). Train running information is provided by customer help points, digital CIS displays and timetable posters on each platform (along with waiting shelters). Step-free access is offered to both sides via the level crossing.\n\nThe majority of passenger services at Lydney are provided by Transport for Wales, with an hourly -- service in each direction (although there are a couple of gaps during the middle of the day). On Sundays, there is a two-hourly service each way.\n\nCrossCountry also serve the station as part of their Cardiff Central to via Birmingham New Street route. Monday to Saturday, there are six trains per day in each direction. There is no Sunday service on this route.\n\nThere is no footbridge at the station, and therefore no means of crossing the line to get to the opposing platform once the level crossing gates close in advance of a train arriving.\n\nAn incident occurred at the station's level crossing on 23 March 2011 when a fault with the automatic barriers caused a northbound CrossCountry service to pass over the crossing at while the gates were raised (although the traffic lights were red).\n"}
{"id": "2275608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275608", "title": "Candice Stowe", "text": "Candice Stowe\n\nCandice Stowe is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", played by Nikki Sanderson. She was introduced as the best friend of Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). She made her first appearance during the episode airing on 5 November 1999.\n\nCandice first appeared as Sarah Platt's (Tina O'Brien) best friend from school. Candice was one of the first people Sarah told of her pregnancy. While many of Sarah's friends turned against her, Candice stuck by her throughout the pregnancy and birth of her daughter Bethany. She was Bethany's godmother.\n\nHer mother did not approve of Sarah when she became pregnant and called her a bad influence on her daughter, but it was later revealed that Candice was the bad influence on Sarah. Candice and her mother's relationship broke down when Candice's mother would not believe that she was being sexually harassed by her mother's boyfriend. Sarah's grandmother, Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), soon took pity on Candice and she moved into the salon flat. Candice then went on to work as a trainee hairdresser in Audrey's salon.\n\nCandice dated Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), but he broke up with her after discovering that she had slept with Jason (Ryan Thomas), his older half brother. When promising footballer Warren Baldwin (Danny Young) arrived in Weatherfield she dreamed of fame and soon got together with him. But he later ended their relationship when he left to play for a Spanish team. Candice also dated Darren Michaels (Nicholas Zabel) and Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson), but later dumped him via text message as she left the street when Status Quo offered her a job as a stylist.\n\nIn June 2005, it was reported that Sanderson had quit her role as Candice. \"I have had the most fantastic and memorable time here at Corrie,\" Sanderson said. She went on to say: \"I made the decision to leave as it is time for me and Candice to leave the cobbles on a high. I am really sad to be going because I will miss everybody. I am excited about what the future holds and I'd like to thank everybody for the fantastic opportunities I have been given.\"\n\n\"Coronation Street\" producer Tony Wood said: \"Candice is a character with a great deal of ambition and we felt it was not believable that she would stay in Weatherfield forever. At the same time Nikki has indicated that she wants to try her hand at other projects - it therefore suits Coronation Street and Nikki for the character to be written out this autumn. Nikki has been a real asset to the show and the writers have had great fun writing for Candice. We wish her all the best for the future.\"\n\nFollowing her departure \"The People\" claimed that Sanderson quit her role after becoming tired of being sidelined by the show's producers. She apparently felt that the soap's scriptwriters favoured her fellow cast-members Tina O'Brien (Sarah Platt) and Samia Ghadie (Maria Sutherland). The newspaper claimed that Sanderson told former boyfriend Jamie Meakin about her frustrations. \"The whole thing about Nikki leaving Corrie for love and a singing career is really only half the truth and bit of a smoke screen,\" Meakin revealed. \"She would say, 'I'm just as good as anyone else' and get all upset. To be honest, Nikki was jealous of the attention Tina and Samia got all the time.\" Sanderson later denied the rumours, explaining, \"I've never felt sidelined by anyone. You only have to watch the show to see that I've had some fantastic storylines which I have thoroughly enjoyed. The only person who knows the real reasons why I'm leaving the show is me. I knew there would be speculation but to say things that aren't true hurts.\" In November 2011, the \"Daily Star\" revealed that \"Coronation Street\" producer Phil Collinson was planning on bringing back Sanderson and Tina O'Brien who played Sarah Platt between 1999 and 2007 in a bid to fill the gap left by the departures of Helen Flanagan who played Rosie Webster and Katherine Kelly who played Becky McDonald. A source told the paper: \"He's aware that Sarah and Candice were hugely popular characters. He thinks it would be a ratings winner to bring them back. Losing Katherine and Helen is a big blow to the show so Phil wants to beef things up a bit with the return of a couple of big names.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Sanderson who has since joined \"Hollyoaks\" playing the role of Maxine Minniver revealed that she has never considered reprising her role as Candice. Speaking to the \"Manchester Evening News\", Sanderson said: \"I've never even thought about going back to Corrie – I left seven years ago. I've done so many other things in that time. That's why it doesn't even feel like a crossover going into Hollyoaks, I've had a complete career between the two soaps.\" She continued: \"Corrie was my first main job and I loved it, I loved being challenged. When I left Corrie I went on to a job where we were filming four or five scenes a day. I couldn't believe it, I was used to filming 16 scenes a day! I'd just assumed all TV work was like that.\"\n\nFollowing O'Brien's return as Sarah in 2015, Sanderson said to \"The Sun\": \"Tina's back on the cobbles, bless her. Could they tempt me back to the cobbles? No, I am loving it where I am at the moment.\"\n"}
{"id": "2275615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275615", "title": "Chair of Saint Peter", "text": "Chair of Saint Peter\n\nThe Chair of Saint Peter (), also known as the Throne of Saint Peter, is a relic conserved in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, the sovereign enclave of the Pope inside Rome, Italy. The relic is a wooden throne that tradition claims the Apostle Saint Peter, the leader of the Early Christians in Rome and first Pope, used as Bishop of Rome. The relic is enclosed in a sculpted gilt bronze casing designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and executed between 1647 and 1653. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI described the chair as \"a symbol of the special mission of Peter and his Successors to tend Christ’s flock, keeping it united in faith and in charity.\"\n\nThe wooden throne was a gift from Holy Roman Emperor Charles the Bald to Pope John VIII in 875. It has been studied many times over the years, the last being from 1968 to 1974, when it was last removed from the Bernini altar. That study concluded that it was not a double, but rather a single, chair with a covering and that no part of the chair dated earlier than the sixth century.\n\nThe relic itself is described as an oaken chair damaged by cuts and worms. The Chair has metal rings attached to each side, allowing use as a \"sedia gestatoria\". The back and front of the chair are trimmed with carved ivory. This description comes from 1867, when the relic was photographed and displayed for veneration.\n\nThe reliquary, like many of the medieval period, takes the form of the relic it protects, i.e. the form of a chair. Symbolically, the chair Bernini designed had no earthly counterpart in actual contemporary furnishings. It is formed entirely of scrolling members, enclosing a coved panel where the upholstery pattern is rendered as a low relief of Christ instructing Peter to tend to His sheep. Large angelic figures flank an openwork panel beneath a highly realistic bronze seat cushion, vividly empty: the relic is encased within.\n\nThe cathedra is lofted on splayed scrolling bars that appear to be effortlessly supported by four over-lifesize bronze Doctors of the Church: Western doctors Saint Ambrose and Saint Augustine of Hippo on the outsides, wearing miters, and Eastern doctors Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Athanasius on the insides, both bare-headed. The cathedra appears to hover over the altar in the basilica's apse, lit by a central tinted window through which light streams, illuminating the gilded glory of sunrays and sculpted clouds that surrounds the window. Like Bernini's \"Ecstasy of Saint Theresa\", this is a definitive fusion of the Baroque arts, unifying sculpture and richly polychrome architecture and manipulating effects of light.\n\nAbove, on the golden background of the frieze, is the Latin inscription: \" (O Shepherd of the Church, you feed all Christ's lambs and sheep). On the right is the same writing in Greek. Behind the altar is placed Bernini's monument enclosing the wooden chair, both of which are seen as symbolic of the authority of the Bishop of Rome as Vicar of Christ and successor of Saint Peter.\n\nEarly martyrologies indicate that two liturgical feasts were celebrated in Rome, centuries before the time of Charles the Bald, in honour of earlier chairs associated with Saint Peter, one of which was kept in the baptismal chapel of St. Peter's Basilica, the other at the catacomb of Priscilla. The dates of these celebrations were January 18 and February 22. No surviving chair has been identified with either of these chairs. The feasts thus became associated with an abstract understanding of the \"Chair of Peter\", which by synecdoche signifies the episcopal office of the Pope as Bishop of Rome, an office considered to have been first held by Saint Peter, and thus extended to the diocese, the See of Rome. Though both feasts were originally associated with Saint Peter's stay in Rome, the ninth-century form of the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\" associated the January 18 feast with his stay in Rome, and the February 22 feast with his stay at Antioch. The two feasts were included in the Tridentine Calendar with the rank of Double, which Pope Clement VIII raised in 1604 to the newly invented rank of Greater Double.\n\nIn 1960 Pope John XXIII removed from the General Roman Calendar the January 18 feast of the Chair of Peter, along with seven other feast days that were second feasts of a single saint or mystery. The February 22 celebration became a Second-Class Feast. This calendar was incorporated in the 1962 Roman Missal of Pope John XXIII, whose continued use Pope Benedict XVI authorized under the conditions indicated in his motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\". Those Catholics who follow the pre-1962 calendar continue to celebrate both feast days: \"Saint Peter's Chair at Rome\" on January 18 and the \"Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch\" on February 22.\n\nIn the new classification introduced in 1969 the February 22 celebration appears in the Roman Calendar with the rank of Feast.\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to \"WWF SmackDown!\", which was released in March 2000, and was succeeded by \"WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It\" on the PlayStation 2 in November 2001.\n\nIt is the best-selling combat sports game on a single format (PlayStation) with 3.2 million copies sold.\n\nThis also marks the last WWE game to ever feature Chyna just months before parting ways with the company, until she was announced as DLC for \"WWE 2K20\" in 2019. Several re-release versions of the game exist with WWE branding in the cover and disc, due to the promotion's name change in May 2002; however in-game branding were not changed in any of them.\n\nThe Season Mode was heavily modified in this game. Along with removing the pre-season mode from the original, \"Know Your Role\" gave more storylines and more matches per show. These changes were given a mixed reaction by fans and critics alike. There are a number of flaws in the Season Mode, such as the long loading times needed for even the most insignificant scenes (like a wrestler walking down a corridor). Wrestlers, wrestling moves, and arenas are unlocked as the player progresses through a season. The Season Mode has multiplayer support, with up to four players playing at once in a Season. Wrestlers such as Shawn Michaels, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Billy Gunn, Mick Foley (including Cactus Jack) and Debra Marshall are unlockable superstars. \n\nThroughout the series, this is Michael Cole's first appearance as an unlockable superstar, the second game being WWF No Mercy, and his last in the series not until WWE '12 as a DLC superstar.\n\nBig Show and Ken Shamrock were removed from the game before release; Big Show had been removed from the promotion's programming and sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling while Shamrock left WWF to return to mixed martial arts competition, but both may randomly appear during a Royal Rumble match (of which the player can take control of) and can be used in other modes using cheat devices, although their names were removed.\n\n\"WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role\" was the first game in the \"SmackDown\" series which introduced advanced Create-A-Superstar, allowing the player to create a character in greater detail as opposed to just choosing preset mix-and-match templates like the previous game. A unique feature, Create-A-Manager was included which allows the player to assign managers such as Paul Bearer and Tori to different superstars. In addition, more features were added such as Create-A-Moveset, Create-A-Taunt, and Create-A-Stable which allowed up to 4 members.\n\nDaniel Erickson reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"There are tons of options and great multiplayer matches, but \"Smackdown\"'s Story mode falls on its candy ass.\"\n\nThe game received \"universal acclaim\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 30 out of 40.\n\nThe PlayStation version of \"WWF SmackDown! 2\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

The southern portion of the cave requires you to crawl through a trench dug out of the clay floor of the cave leading to a small space approximately long by wide by high in which you can turn around to return to the main cavern.\n\nIt is called Kuna Caves despite being only a single cave system.

In the general elections in 2013, PML-Z contested two seats and won again from NA-191 Bahawalnagar in the National Assembly, and two seats in the Punjab Assembly. Haq's constituency NA-191 recorded the highest voter turnout in the country for 2013.\n"}

It merged with PML-Q in 2004.\n\nIt is one of the factions of the original Pakistan Muslim League, named \"J\" after Muhammad Khan Junejo. It was created in 1986 as the sole Pakistan Muslim League when Muhammad Khan Junejo was the Prime Minister of Pakistan under President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. In September 1988, the party formed an alliance called Islami Jamhoori Ittehad with Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi's National Peoples Party, and Qazi Hussain Ahmed's Jamaat-e-Islami against Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party for the 1988 general elections. During that time Nawaz Sharif became the most prominent politician outside PPP, and eventually became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1990.\n\nAfter Junejo dismissed by Gen Zia ul Haq, Nawaz Sharif parted with the PML, and created his own faction called the PML (N), which became a major political party far more influential than the original PML. Junejo's death also marked the formation of PML (Junejo) in 1993 led by his supporters including Hamid Nasir Chattha and Iqbal Ahmed Khan.\n\nThere was a party split within PML (Junejo) when Manzoor Wattoo in 1995 parted ways with his cousin Hamid Nasir Chattha and created his own PML (Jinnah). The party broke because Chattha wanted to be the president of PML (Junejo), much to the annoyance of Wattoo. The differences cropped up in the same year when Wattoo was removed as the Punjab Chief Minister in the power struggle between the province (headed by PML (Junejo) and the center (headed by rival PPP), leading Arif Nakai another PML (Junejo) candidate to be the new Chief Minister.\n\nAt the 2002 general elections held on October 20, the party won 0.7% of the popular vote and 2 out of 272 elected members.

{"id": "2275640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275640", "title": "Distillery District", "text": "Distillery District\n\nThe Distillery District is a commercial and residential district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located east of downtown, it contains numerous cafés, restaurants, and shops housed within heritage buildings of the former Gooderham and Worts Distillery. The district comprises more than forty heritage buildings and ten streets, and is the largest collection of Victorian-era industrial architecture in North America.\n\nThe district was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988.\n\nThe Gooderham and Worts Distillery was founded in 1832. Once providing over of whisky, mostly for export on the world market, the company was bought out in later years by rival Hiram Walker Co., another large Canadian distiller. Its location on the side of the Canadian National Railway mainline and its proximity to the mouth of the original route of the Don River outlet into Lake Ontario created a hard edge which separated the district from neighbouring communities. These did, however, allow for a facilitated transport connection to the rest of Canada and the world and acted as Toronto's domination as an industrial centre or transshipping hub.\n\nWith the deindustrialization of the surrounding area in the late 20th century, and the winding-down of the distillery operations, the district was left increasingly derelict. Surrounding industrial and commercial buildings and structures were often demolished, leaving the former distillery surrounded primarily by empty lots. Nonetheless, the closing of the remaining distillery operations in 1990 created redevelopment and investment opportunities for a district that contained the largest and best preserved collection of Victorian-era industrial architecture in North America. The Distillery District was designated as a National Historic Site, and has been protected under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" since 1976. It was listed by \"National Geographic\" magazine as a \"top pick\" in Canada for travellers.\n\nThe economic recession of the early 1990s, however, and the resulting crash in residential condominium prices and office lease rates in downtown Toronto, delayed efforts to revitalize the district. Nonetheless, two residential condominium buildings were constructed on the periphery of the district during the late 1990s.\n\nWhile the site awaited redevelopment and reinvestment, the district's ambiance began to attract numerous film shoots. Since 1990, the site has served as a location for over 800 film and television productions.\n\nIn 2001, the site was purchased by Cityscape Holdings Inc., which transformed the district into a pedestrian-orientated area. Work was completed and the district reopened to the public by 2003. The new owners refused to lease any of the retail and restaurant space to chains or franchises, and accordingly, the majority of the buildings are occupied with boutiques, art galleries, restaurants, jewellery stores, cafés, and coffeehouses, including a well-known microbrewery, the Mill Street Brewery. The upper floors of a number of buildings have been leased to artists as studio spaces and to office tenants with a \"creative focus\". A new theatre, the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, has opened on the site and serves as the home of the Soulpepper Theatre Company and the George Brown Theatre School. There are plans to develop residential condominiums, offices, and more retail space on the vacant lands that surround the district.\n\nNew condominium developments will be located at the south-east corner of the neighbourhood, bordering on Cherry Street and Tank House Lane.\n\nThe Pan American Games' Athletes' Village was built in the area in 2015, in conjunction with an extension to the streetcar network constructed along Cherry Street. After the games, the athletes village was converted to townhouses, condos, affordable housing, and retail space.\n\nThe Toronto Christmas Market is an annual outdoor tradition run within the Distillery District, and for last year it was open from November 15 - December 23, 2018. It is turned into a magical 'town-like' area covered with twinkly lights, ribbon, and in the center of the market is a 54 ft Christmas tree. The market includes \"Santa's house\", an Indigo pop-up shop, pet photos with Santa, a Ferris wheel and themed entertainment each day (e.g. Friday night jazz). There are also multiple food vendors and dining locations that are popular tourist attractions such as French Canadian Poutine, the Gingerbread House, Maple Leaf Fudge, Mill Street Brewery, and more.\n\nIn 2017, Canadian singer Shawn Mendes and American model Hailey Baldwin attended the Toronto Christmas Market.\n\nThe Distillery District's traditional brick-paved streets and lanes are restricted to pedestrians and cyclists, with general motor vehicle traffic restricted to streets and parking areas outside of the district's historic centre. Several large sculptures installed along the lanes enliven its streetscapes, three being on Distillery Lane and the final one at the parking area at the end of Trinity Street. Another primary landmark is the chimney stack atop the Boiler House complex. There are informal public spaces on the pedestrianized streets with chairs and tables for general use, as well as formal patios for some of its coffee houses and restaurants.\n\nTrinity Street is the widest street in the district and often functions as a public square for events such as market days. The main thoroughfares within the district are Distillery Lane from Parliament Street running southeast to Trinity Street, Trinity Street from Mill Street at its north end to the motor vehicle parking area at its south end, and Tank House Lane from Trinity Street east to Cherry Street. The four borders of the Distillery District are Parliament Street to the west, Mill Street to the north, Cherry Street to the east, and the parking area to the south with the condominiums along Distillery Lane forming hard edges to pedestrians.\n\nThe Distillery District can be reached via the Toronto Transit Commission's 121 Fort York-Esplanade bus route, and since June 2016 the 514 Cherry streetcar line has its eastern terminus at the Distillery Loop to the east of the historic district, providing service along King Street through the downtown core as far west as Dufferin Gate Loop in Liberty Village.\n\nThe surrounding lands are animated with a mix of uses: residential areas at Parliament and Distillery and at the eastern end of Mill Street up to Cherry, restaurants along Trinity Street, Tank House Lane, Brewery Lane, and Case Goods Lane, and education uses at the eastern end of Tank House Lane.\n\nToronto's Official Plan designates the Distillery District as a mixed-use land parcel, which is an area that includes a combination of land uses such as commercial, residential, entertainment facilities and art galleries. In order to provide additional details regarding the breakdown of the types of mixed uses in the area, the King-Parliament Secondary Plan is used to determine the locations of the commercial, residential, and other land uses. \n\nIn addition, the plan also outlines design guidelines and places emphasis on enhancing the existing historical buildings. The plan divides the 13 acre area into three different mixed-use designations. This includes the incorporation of a bike lane and private roadway where the current southern park lot is located. The remaining existing structures within the District all comply with the outlined land uses within the Secondary Plan.\n\nIn addition, the Ontario Heritage Act 1990 is a governing document for the historical buildings that have been redeveloped on the site. Any amendments to this act must be proposed to the Conservation Review Board for approval. In particular, the Secondary Plan reinforces these notions by stating that any additions to existing buildings within mixed use areas 2 and 3 \"may be permitted only if it has been demonstrated that they respect the three-dimensional integrity of the heritage building, and the quality and the character of both the historic building being added to and its relationship to adjacent historical buildings within the area\". The Secondary Plan is important for guiding how development occurs within the area. It provides the course of action for what the future image of the Distillery should look like and ensures that development at a small scale (such as the 13 acre area of the Distillery) is compliant with plans outlined in the City's master plan (official plan) and is reflective of the province's Planning Act (1990), which sets out the ground rules for land use planning.\n\nVarious buildings on the site are protected under part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since 1976. The property at 70 Mill Street is protected under a heritage easement since April 3, 1996.\n\nThe former distillery consisted of a series of buildings, centred around a seven-storey windmill and wharf. Although the windmill and wharf have long since been demolished, a number of buildings from distillery operations remain. These historical buildings include:\n\nThe 2006 Census revealed that the population of the Distillery is largely composed of young adult to middle aged persons aged twenty to fifty-nine. Most households contain one to two persons and the area has a lack of single detached housing. The immigrant population of the area is largely made up of persons of European descent with the overwhelming majority of the population not being visible minorities. The occupation data for the neighbourhood shows that almost a fifth of the residents work in social science/education/government service/religion. Those with jobs in sales and service, business, and arts/ culture/ recreation and sports make up a total of 48% of the occupation categories with an even split of 16% to each job category.\n\n\n\n"}

He ordered her to make a sacrifice to the god Apollo. When she refused because of her Christian faith, she was beaten and sent to prison. \n\nUpon her release from prison, she still held steadfastly to her faith in Jesus Christ. This time her punishment included flogging, the pouring of boiling tallow upon her, and a second imprisonment. She was at last thrown to a lion in the amphitheater, but it quietly lay down at her feet. \n\nShe was starved for three days in a slaves' prison house, and then tortured upon the rack. Pieces of flesh were next torn from her body with iron hooks, and she was thrown on a burning pile. \n\nShe miraculously still remained alive, but was beheaded at the tenth milestone on the Via Ostiensis—the road from Rome to Ostia. The Christians buried her body in a catacomb at the place of her death, where now stands a church of St. Prisca and where previously stood a very early title church, the \"Titulus Priscoe\", mentioned in the fifth century and likely built in the fourth.\n\nAccording to Catholic theologian Johann Kirsch, extant narratives are unhistorical and their details impossible.\n\n"}

BNP believes in more provincial rights and greater autonomy for Baluchistan province through peaceful and democratic struggle.\n\nIn 1972, the National Awami Party or NAP formed the first elected government in Balochistan after winning the elections and Ataullah Mengal was sworn in as the first Chief Minister of Balochistan. But just nine months after the formation of the NAP Government, it was overthrown by Bhutto who used Nawab Akbar Bugti's allegation that Mengal's regime wanted to disintegrate Pakistan and liberate Balochistan as grounds for this dismissal. Ataullah Mengal, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Gul Khan Nasir, Nawab Khair Bux Marri and the other NAP leaders were thrown in jail. They were released when Bhutto's government was toppled by Zia-ul-Haq, after spending more than four years in captivity. By this time differences had arisen between the NAP leadership, so while Mengal, Bizenjo and Nasir went to the NAP headquarters, Khair Bux and Shero Marri headed home.\n\nLater, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo formed the Pakistan National Party or PNP after differences arose between him and Wali Khan over the Kabul Revolution (he supported the revolution while Wali Khan was against it). Gul Khan joined PNP and became the President of its Balochistan wing while Ataullah went into exile in London.\n\nIn 1996, Ataullah Mengal returned to Pakistan and formed the Balochistan National Party.\n\nBNP swept the 1997 elections and was able to form a coalition government in Balochistan with Sardar Ataullah Mengal's son, Akhtar Mengal as the Chief Minister. This government did not last long as, soon, differences began arising between the Balochistan Provincial Government and the Federal Government.\n\nAfter the dismissal of their first government, BNP hasn't taken part in any elections. In 2002, the party didn't compete in the elections in protest of General Pervez Musharraf's October 1999 military coup which allowed the pro-military religious alliance to win almost all the moderate and nationalist constituencies. Though a few members of the party did take part in the elections independently. One of these members got elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan, one to the Senate of Pakistan and two to the Provincial Assembly i.e. Mir Akbar Mengal and Mir Akhtar Hussain Langove.\n\nIn 2006, Nawab Akbar Bugti was killed by the Pakistani Army. BNP had vehemently criticized the government when the operation in Balochistan had been launched and after Bugti's death all four of its independently elected representatives resigned from their seats of the National and Provincial Assemblies.\n\nIn December 2006 Akhtar Mengal was arrested for allegedly ordering his security guards to beat up secret service personnel. Mengal maintained that these secret service officials had tried to kidnap his children as they returned from school and as a result, the security guards had beaten them. During his trial, according to Mr Iqbal Haider, secretary-general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, \"Mr Mengal was brought into the courtroom and shoved into an iron cage with bars all around that stood in a corner away from his counsel.” Mengal was released in 2008, after the Pakistan Peoples Party government came in power, after spending almost one and a half year in jail.\n\nAfter Akhtar Mengal's arrest, the rest of the BNP leadership was also imprisoned mainly in MPO cases. On December 2, Sajid Tareen was arrested from his chambers, Habib Jalib Baloch, Mir Akhtar Hussain Langove and Akbar Mengal were also arrested the same day. Jahanzeb Jamaldini was also put under arrest in December. Then, on January 3, 2007 the acting Chief of BNP, Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was also arrested along with other activists while they were on their way to meet imprisoned workers of BNP in Khuzdar.\n\nThe Balochistan National Party's main goal has been for the provinces having control over their resources. Under the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan, the federal government has broad powers, though the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan brought some changes.\n\nBalochistan National Party's third council session was held between 25 and 28 June 2009. It was presided over by an ailment stricken Akhtar Mengal. In this council session the leadership and central committee members of the party were selected as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She gave encouragement to Laurie Lee while he was writing his bestselling \"Cider with Rosie\".\n\nSmith was born as Elspeth Hallsmith in Cornwall, daughter of a bank clerk, Guthrie Hallsmith, D.S.O. and his wife Janet, a nurse. Her father suffered a nervous breakdown and left the family, after which Smith only saw him three more times in his life. She received a \"negligible\" private education up to the age of 16, when she decided to take up a job at the War Office. During the Second World War, she volunteered to work on the canals as a boatswoman. Later on, her experiences as a trainee boatswoman on the Grand Union Canal would become the basis for her debut novel, \"Maidens' Trip\".\n\nIn September 1946, Smith, still only 23, went off to India with a team of documentary film-makers that included the poet Laurie Lee, who served as the scriptwriter on the team. During the trip, \"Cider with Rosie\", Lee's classic account of growing up in rural Gloucestershire, was in its embryonic stages. Emma Smith was one of those who would later encourage Lee to complete what became one of the best loved accounts of childhood in English literature.\n\nAfter nine months in India, Smith returned to England in 1947 and set down to write her first book. \"Maidens' Trip\" (1948) proved to be a critical and a commercial success and won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. With the proceeds from it, she moved to Paris, where she took a room in the Hotel de Tournon and, drawing on her memories of India, typed up her second novel. It was reprinted by Bloomsbury in 2011. It was while working on her second novel in Paris in 1948 that Smith was photographed with her typewriter on the quay at the Ile de la Cité by the French street photographer Robert Doisneau, who was commissioned by Paris Match. After appearing in the magazine, Doisneau continued to use the photograph in his collections.\n\n\"The Far Cry\" was published in 1949 to even greater acclaim and republished in 2002 by Persephone Books. The tale of a young English girl and her cantankerous father travelling together through India, it was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1949, and later reissued in a Penguin edition.\n\nIn 1951, Smith married, and within six years became the mother of two children, then suddenly a widow. She then moved to Radnorshire in rural Wales to raise her children.\n\nHer writing took a back seat to her family duties. Only very slowly did she return to writing. She produced several children's books, as well as a novel, \"The Opportunity of a Lifetime\", in 1978. But she never regained the celebrity she had enjoyed in the late 1940s. The specialist canal book publisher M. & M. Baldwin pioneered the revival of interest in Emma Smith's work, by republishing her award-winning \"Maidens' Trip\" in 1987 and keeping it in print for many years.\n\nThe novelist Susan Hill has been instrumental in a recent revival of interest in Emma Smith's works. Many years after \"The Far Cry\" had gone out of print, Hill found a copy in a jumble sale and wrote enthusiastically of her discovery in the \"Daily Telegraph\". In 2002 – 50 years after the Penguin edition – Persephone Books reprinted \"The Far Cry\" as one of a series of forgotten classics by women writers. Hill supplied the afterword to that edition.\n\nAfter 1980, Emma Smith lived in Putney in south-west London.\n\nIn 2008, Smith returned to writing with a memoir, \"The Great Western Beach\", describing her childhood in Cornwall between the two World Wars. Bloomsbury Publishing, its publishers, went on to republish \"Maidens' Trip\" in 2009. The success of her first memoir led Bloomsbury Publishing to encouraged her to write a sequel. This appeared as \"As Green As Grass\" in 2013, and covered her life between 1935, when she left Newquay at the age of 12, to 1951 when she married.\n\nEmma Smith died peacefully in Putney on 24 April 2018, at the age of 94. Her family and friends were around her.\n\n"}

The Russian Prince Yusupov purchased the cello for Servais ca. 1845, and it was subsequently passed to his son. The cello was later donated to the Smithsonian by Charlotte Bergen of New Jersey. Cellist Anner Bylsma used the Servais in his 1992 recording of the J. S. Bach: \"Suites for Unaccompanied Cello\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2275690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275690", "title": "Adjustable gastric band", "text": "Adjustable gastric band\n\nA laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, commonly called a lap-band, A band, or LAGB, is an inflatable silicone device placed around the top portion of the stomach to treat obesity, intended to decrease food consumption.\n\nAdjustable gastric band surgery is an example of bariatric surgery designed for obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater—or between 35 and 40 in cases of patients with certain comorbidities that are known to improve with weight loss, such as sleep apnea, diabetes, osteoarthritis, GERD, hypertension (high blood pressure), or metabolic syndrome, among others.\n\nIn February 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded approval of adjustable gastric bands to patients with a BMI between 30 and 40 and one weight-related medical condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. However, an adjustable gastric band may be used only after other methods such as diet and exercise have been tried.\n\nThe inflatable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch. This slows and limits the amount of food that can be consumed at one time, thus giving the opportunity for the sense of satiety to be met with the release of peptide YY (PYY). It does not decrease gastric emptying time. The individual achieves sustained weight loss by choosing healthy food options, limiting food intake and volume, reducing appetite, and progress of food from the top portion of the stomach to the lower portion digestion.\n\nAccording to the American Society for Metabolic Bariatric Surgery, bariatric surgery is not an easy option for obesity sufferers. It is a drastic step, and carries the usual pain and risks of any major gastrointestinal surgical operation.\n\nHowever, gastric banding is the least invasive surgery of its kind and is completely reversible, with another \"keyhole\" operation. Gastric banding is performed using laparoscopic surgery and usually results in a shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, smaller scars, and less pain than open surgical procedures. Because no part of the stomach is stapled or removed, and the patient's intestines are not re-routed, he or she can continue to absorb nutrients from food normally. Gastric bands are made entirely of biocompatible materials, so they are able to stay in the patient's body without causing harm.\n\nHowever, not all patients are suitable for laparoscopy. Patients who are extremely obese, who have had previous abdominal surgery, or have complicating medical problems may require the open approach.\n\nThe surgical insertion of an adjustable gastric band is often referred to as a lap band procedure or band placement. First, a small incision (typically less than 1.25 cm or 0.5 in.) is made near the belly button. Carbon dioxide (a gas that occurs naturally in the body) is introduced into the abdomen to create a work space for the surgeon. Then a small laparoscopic camera is placed through the incision into the abdomen. The camera sends a picture of the stomach and abdominal cavity to a video monitor. It gives the surgeon a good view of the key structures in the abdominal cavity. A few additional small incisions are made in the abdomen. The surgeon watches the video monitor and works through these small incisions using instruments with long handles to complete the procedure. The surgeon creates a small, circular tunnel behind the stomach, inserts the gastric band through the tunnel, and locks the band around the stomach.\n\nClinical studies of laparoscopic (minimally invasive) bariatric surgery patients found that they felt better, spent more time doing recreational and physical activities, benefited from enhanced productivity and economic opportunities, and had more self-confidence than they did prior to surgery.\n\nThe placement of the band creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. This pouch holds approximately ½ cup of food, whereas the typical stomach holds about 6 cups of food. The pouch fills with food quickly, and the band slows the passage of food from the pouch to the lower part of the stomach. As the upper part of the stomach registers as full, the message to the brain is that the entire stomach is full, and this sensation helps the person to be hungry less often, feel full more quickly and for a longer period of time, eat smaller portions, and lose weight over time.\n\nAs patients lose weight, their bands will need adjustments, or \"fills\", to ensure comfort and effectiveness. The gastric band is adjusted by introducing a saline solution into a small access port placed just under the skin. A specialized non-coring needle is used to avoid damage to the port membrane and prevent leakage. There are many port designs (such as high profile and low profile), and they may be placed in varying positions based on the surgeon's preference, but are always attached (through sutures, staples, or another method) to the muscle wall in and around the diaphragm.\n\nAdjustable gastric bands hold between 4 and 12 cc of saline solution, depending on their design. When the band is inflated with saline solution, it places pressure around the outside of the stomach. This decreases the size of the passage between the pouch created from the upper part of the stomach and the lower stomach and further restricts the movement of food. Over the course of several visits to the doctor, the band is filled until the optimal restriction has been achieved – neither so loose that hunger is not controlled, nor so tight that food cannot move through the digestive system. The number of adjustments required is an individual experience and cannot be accurately predicted.\n\nIn the U.S. market, two types of adjustable gastric bands have been approved by the FDA: Realize Band and Lap-Band. The Lap-Band System obtained FDA approval in 2001. The device comes in five different sizes and has undergone modification over the years. The latest models, the Lap-Band AP-L and Lap-Band AP-S, feature a standardized injection port sutured into the skin and fill volumes of 14 mL and 10 mL respectively.\n\nThe Realize Adjustable Gastric Band obtained FDA approval in 2007. Realize Band-C has a 14% greater adjustment range than the Realize Band. Both the Realize Band and Realize Band-C, however, are one-size-fits-all. The device differentiates itself from the Lap-Band AP series through its sutureless injection port installation and larger range of isostatic adjustments. The maximum fill volume for the Realize Band is 9 ml, while the newer Realize Band-C has a fill volume of 11 ml. Both fill volumes fall within a low pressure range to prevent discomfort or strain to the band.\n\nTwo other adjustable gastric bands are in use outside of the United States—Heliogast and Midband. Neither band has been approved by the FDA. The Midband was the first to market in 2000. In order to preserve the gastric wall in event of rubbing, the device contains no sharp edges or irregularities. It is also opaque to x-rays, making it easy to locate and adjust.\nThe Heliogast band entered the market in 2003. The device features a streamlined band to ease insertion during the operation.\n\nIn general, gastric banding is indicated for people for whom all of the following apply:\nGastric banding is usually not recommended for people with any of the following:\n\nIf considering pregnancy, ideally the patient should be in optimum nutritional condition prior to, or immediately following, conception; deflation of the band may be required prior to a planned conception. Deflation should also be considered should the patient experience morning sickness. The band may remain deflated during pregnancy and once breast feeding is completed, or if bottle feeding, the band may be gradually re-inflated to aid postpartum weight loss as needed.\n\nIt is highly advised to take extra precautions during intercourse after surgery, as rapid weight loss increases fertility. Effective birth control methods must be used at all times to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Two factors have been pointed out by experts that may help explain this increase in fertility: reversal of PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and reduction in the excess of estrogen, which is produced by fat cells.\n\nUnlike more open forms of weight loss surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), gastric banding does not require cutting or removing any part of the digestive system. It is removable, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure to remove the band, after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded size so it is not unusual for a person to gain weight after having a band removed. However, it is not entirely reversible as adhesions and tissue scarring are inevitable. Unlike those who have procedures such as RNY, DS, or BPD, it is unusual for gastric band patients to experience any nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption of micro-nutrients. Calcium supplements and Vitamin B12 injections are not routinely required following gastric banding (as is often the case with RNY, for example). Gastric dumping syndrome issues also do not occur since intestines are not removed or re-routed.\n\nTypically, patients who undergo adjustable gastric banding procedures lose less weight over the first 3.5 years than those who have RNY gastric bypass, BPD, or DS surgeries. Although other procedures appear to result in greater weight loss than adjustable gastric banding in the short term, results from the study by Maggard suggest that this difference decreases significantly over time. Gastric banding patients lose an average of 47.5% of their excess weight, according to a meta analysis by Buchwald.\n\nIt is important to note that, in order to maintain their weight reduction, patients must carefully follow post-operative guidelines relating to diet, exercise, and band maintenance. Weight regain is possible with any weight loss procedure, including the more radical procedures that initially result in rapid weight loss. The National Institutes of Health recommendation for weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds (½ to 1 kilogram) per week, and an average banded patient may lose this amount. This is variable based on the individual and their personal circumstances, motivation, and mobility.\n\nLonger-term studies are beginning to reveal that adjustable gastric banding (\n\n\nSome studies reveal there is a decrease in adjustable gastric banding surgeries due to the increased risk of reoperation, compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) bariatric procedures.\n\nOne commonly reported occurrence for banded patients is regurgitation of non-acidic swallowed food from the upper pouch, commonly known as Productive Burping (PBing). Productive Burping is not to be considered normal. The patient should consider eating less, eating more slowly and chewing food more thoroughly. Occasionally, the narrow passage into the larger, lower part of the stomach might also become blocked by a large portion of unchewed or unsuitable food.\n\nOther complications include:\n\nThe following are the adverse effects of gastric banding as documented by the FDA.\n\nThe average gastric banding patient loses 500 grams to a kilogram (1–2 pounds) per week consistently, but heavier patients often lose faster in the beginning. This comes to roughly the first year for most band patients. It is important to keep in mind that while most of the RNY patients drop the weight faster in the beginning, some studies have found that LAGB patients will have the same percentage of excess weight loss and comparable ability to keep it off after only a couple of years. The procedure tends to encourage better eating habits which, in turn, helps in producing long term weight stability. However, with greater experience and longer patient follow up, several studies have found suboptimal weight loss and high complication rates for the gastric band.\n\nA systematic review concluded \"LAGB has been shown to produce a significant loss of excess weight while maintaining low rates of short-term complications and reducing obesity-related comorbidities. LAGB may not result in the most weight loss but it may be an option for bariatric patients who prefer or who are better suited to undergo less invasive and reversible surgery with lower perioperative complication rates. One caution with LAGB is the uncertainty about whether the low complication rate extends past three years, given a possibility of increased band-related complications (e.g., erosion, slippage) requiring re-operation\".\n\nResearcher Paul O’Brien, MD, of Melbourne, Australia's Monash University says the procedure offers an effective, reversible, long-term solution for weight loss as long as patients get good follow-up care and are willing to carefully control the way they eat. This study was supported by Allergan Inc., which markets a gastric band system.\n\nCorrect and sensitive adjustment of the band is imperative for weight loss and the long-term success of the procedure. Adjustments (also called \"fills\") may be performed using an X-ray fluoroscope so that the radiologist can assess the placement of the band, the port, and the tubing that runs between the port and the band. The patient is given a small cup of liquid containing a clear or white radio-opaque fluid similar to barium. When swallowed, the fluid is clearly shown on X–ray and is watched as it travels down the esophagus and through the restriction caused by the band. The radiologist is then able to see the level of restriction in the band and to assess if there are potential or developing issues of concern. These may include dilation of the esophagus, an enlarged pouch, prolapsed stomach (when part of the stomach moves into the band where it does not belong), erosion or migration. Reflux type symptoms may indicate too great a restriction and further assessment may be required.\n\nUnder some circumstances, fluid is removed from the band prior to further investigation and re-evaluation. In other cases further surgery may be required (e.g. removal of the band), should gastric erosion or a similar complication be detected. Some health practitioners adjust the band without the use of X-ray control (fluoroscopy). In these cases, the doctor assesses the patient's weight loss and potential reflex symptoms described by the patient, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or chest pain. From this information, the doctor decides whether a band adjustment is necessary. Adjustments are often indicated if a patient has regained weight, if their weight loss has leveled off, or if the patient has a distinct feeling that food is difficult to move through the stomach.\n\nDuring a clinical visit, patients visiting for a regular fill adjustment will typically find they will spend more time talking about the adjustment and their progress than the actual fill itself, which generally will take only about one to two minutes. However, for some patients, this type of fill is not possible, due to issues such as partial rotation of the port, or excess tissue above the port making it difficult to determine its precise location. In these cases, a fluoroscope will generally be used. It is more common practice for the band not to be filled at surgery—although some surgeons choose to place a small amount in the band at the time of surgery. The stomach tends to swell following surgery and it is possible that too great a restriction would be achieved if filled at that time.\n\nMany health practitioners make the first adjustment between 4 and 6 weeks post operatively to allow the stomach time to heal. After that, fills are performed as needed.\n\nNo accurate number of adjustments required can be given. The amount of saline/isotonic solution needed in the band varies from patient to patient. There are a small number of people who find they do not need a fill at all and have sufficient restriction immediately following surgery. Others may need significant adjustments to the maximum the band is able to hold.\n\nThe patient may be prescribed a liquid-only diet, followed by mushy foods and then solids. This is prescribed for a varied length of time and each surgeon and manufacturer varies. Some may find that before their first fill, they are still able to eat fairly large portions. This is not surprising since before the fill there is little or no restriction in the band. This is why a proper post-op diet and a good after-care plan are essential to success. A recent study found that patients who did not change their eating habits were 2.2 times more likely to be unsuccessful than those who did, and that patients who had not increased their physical activity were 2.3 times more likely to be unsuccessful than those who did.\n\nA long-term, post-gastric-band surgery diet should consist of normal healthy food that is solid in nature and requires ample chewing to achieve a paste consistency prior to swallowing. This texture will maximise the effect of the band, rather than choosing easier wet foods, such as soups, casseroles and smoothies, which pass through the band quickly and easily resulting in greater caloric intake.\n\nSupport groups exist for gastric banding patients. Some mix RNY and gastric bypass patients with gastric banding patients. Some gastric band patients have criticized this approach because, while many of the underlying issues related to obesity are the same, the needs and challenges of the two groups are very different, as are their early rates of weight loss. Some gastric band recipients feel the procedure is a failure when they see that RNY patients generally lose weight faster.\n\nAdjustable gastric band surgery costs average about $15,000 in the United States, although state-specific averages range from about $10,500 (Colorado and Texas) to over $33,000 (Alaska). Services included in these costs vary by surgical clinic and hospital, but most practices include all services necessary to perform the procedure (surgeon's fee, surgical assistant fee, hospital/operating room fee, anesthesiologist fee and the device fee for the gastric band itself). Some practices also bundle a set duration of post-operative follow-up visits for filling and unfilling the gastric band as necessary (e.g., as many fills/unfills as necessary for anywhere from 3 to 13 months following surgery, depending on the practice), which as a stand-alone service cost between $15 and $300 per office visit. Most practices do not include within their quoted fees the cost of pre-operative care and testing or any potential complications that may arise.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, Wilkinson developed several surgical approaches whose common aim was to limit food intake without disrupting the continuity of the gastro-intestinal tract.\n\nIn 1978 Wilkinson and Peloso were the first to place, by open procedure, a non-adjustable band (2 cm Marlex mesh) around the upper part of the stomach.\n\nThe early 1980s saw further developments, with Kolle (Norway), Molina & Oria (US), Naslund (Sweden), Frydenberg (Australia) and Kuzmack (United States) implanting non-adjustable gastric bands made from a variety of different materials, including marlex mesh, dacron vascular prosthesis, silicone covered mesh and Gore-Tex, among others. In addition, Bashour developed the \"gastro-clip\", a 10.5 cm polypropylene clip with a 50cc pouch and a fixed 1.25 cm stoma, which was later abandoned due to high rates of gastric erosion\n\nAll these early attempts at restriction using meshes, bands and clips showed a high failure rate due to difficulty in achieving correct stomal diameter, stomach slippage, erosion, food intolerance, intractable vomiting and pouch dilatation. Despite these difficulties, an important ancillary observation was that silicone was identified as the best tolerated material for a gastric device, with far fewer adhesions and tissue reactions than other materials. Nevertheless, adjustability became the “Holy Grail” of these early pioneers.\n\nThe development of the modern adjustable gastric band is a tribute both to the vision and persistence of the early pioneers, particularly Lubomyr Kuzmak and a sustained collaborative effort on the part of bio-engineers, surgeons and scientists.\n\nEarly research on the concept of band “adjustability” can be traced back to the early work of G. Szinicz (Austria) who experimented with an adjustable band, connected to a subcutaneous port, in animals.\n\nIn 1986, Lubomyr Kuzmak, a Ukrainian surgeon who had emigrated to the United States in 1965, reported on the clinical use of the “adjustable silicone gastric band” (ASGB) via open surgery. Kuzmak, who from the early 1980s had been searching for a simple and safe restrictive procedure for severe obesity, modified his original silicone non-adjustable band he had been using since 1983, by adding an adjustable portion. His clinical results showed an improved weight loss and reduced complication rates compared with the non-adjustable band he had started using in 1983. Kuzmak's major contributions were the application of Mason's teachings about VBG to the development of the gastric band; the volume of the pouch; the need to overcome staple line disruption; the ratification of the use of silicone and the essential element of adjustability.\n\nSeparately, but in parallel with Kuzmak, Hallberg and Forsell in Stockholm, Sweden also developed an adjustable gastric band. After further work and modifications this eventually became known as the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB).\n\nIn early 1985, Dr. Dag Hallberg applied for a patent for the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB) within Scandinavian countries. In late March, Dr. Hallberg presented his idea of the \"balloon band\" at the Swedish Surgical Society and started to use the SAGB in a controlled series of 50 procedures. During this time, laparoscopic surgery was not common and Dr. Hallberg and his assistant, Dr. Peter Forsell, started performing the open technique to implant the SAGB.\n\nIn 1992, Dr. Forsell was in contact with different surgeons in Switzerland, Italy and Germany who began to implant the SAGB with the laparoscopic technique. Dr. Forsell fully owned the patent at this time.\nIn 1994, Dr. Forsell presented the SAGB at an international workshop for bariatric surgery in Sweden, and from then on, the SAGB started to be implanted laparoscopically. During this time, the SAGB was manufactured by a Swedish company, ATOS Medical.\n\nThe advent of surgical laparoscopy has transformed the field of bariatric surgery and made the gastric band a more appealing option for the surgical management of obesity. In 1992, Prof. Guy-Bernard Cadière was the first to apply an adjustable band (the Kuzmak ASGB device) by the laparoscopic approach. Over the next couple of years, the Kuzmak ASGB was modified to make it suitable for laparoscopic implantation, eventually emerging as the modern lap band. This landmark innovation was driven by Belachew, Cadière, Favretti and O’Brien; the Inamed Development Company engineered the device. The first human laparoscopic implantation of the newly developed lap band was performed by Belachew and le Grand on 1 September 1993 in Huy, Belgium, followed on 8 September, by Cadière and Favretti in Padua, Italy. In 1993, Broadbent in Australia and Catona in Italy, implanted non-adjustable (Molina-type) gastric bands by laparoscopy. In 1994, the first international laparoscopic band workshop was held in Belgium and the first on the SAGB in Sweden.\n\nSingle port laparoscopy (SPL) is an advanced, minimally invasive procedure in which the surgeon operates almost exclusively through a single entry point, typically the navel. Special articulating instruments and access ports make it unnecessary to place trocars externally for triangulation, thus allowing the creation of a small, solitary portal of entry into the abdomen. The SPL technique has been used to perform many types of surgery, including adjustable gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy.\n\nIn 2003, the American Institute of Gastric Banding (AIGB) True Results opened the first outpatient surgery center using advanced laparoscopic technology to be recognized by the American College of Surgeons as an Accredited Outpatient Bariatric Center in the United States. The first outpatient Lap Band procedure in the United States was performed in Texas at AIGB True Results' Surgery Center of Richardson in 2003 and since that time the AIGB True Results has performed more than 30,000 outpatient Lap Band procedures.\n\nThere is currently a request for a congressional investigation by members of the U.S. Congress into lapband safety, prompted by recent patient deaths after lapband surgeries at clinics affiliated with the 1-800-GET-THIN advertising campaign in Southern California.\n\nAs with many developments in approaches to weight loss, some public figures have affected public opinion and increased awareness of gastric banding:\n\n"}

The new station is unstaffed, and consists of two platforms, linked by a footbridge, a car park covered by CCTV and a bus stop with shelter. Passenger facilities consist of shelters with seats on both platforms and a ticket machine, with passenger help points installed in late 2010.\n\nPassenger services are provided by Great Western Railway on a largely hourly basis on the Bristol to Gloucester route. It is the nearest station to the town of Wotton-under-Edge, which is seven miles away.\n\nBus services run regularly to the station. The 210/211 service provides a link between Dursley, Cam and the station, and runs to a timetable that links in with trains to both Gloucester and Bristol. Service 87 runs from Dursley to Wotton-under-Edge and Thornbury every two hours during the day, and service 281 provides an infrequent service to Coaley, Ashmead Green, Upper Cam and Dursley.\n\nThere is a rail user group for the station, Coaley Junction Action Committee (CoJAC), which, following the opening of the new station, continues as a group to press for improvements in the service.\n\nCoaley Junction station was originally the junction for the short Dursley and Midland Junction Railway branch to Cam and Dursley, built in 1856 and later taken over by the Midland Railway. The station, also known as Dursley Road, opened to goods on 2 August 1856 and to passengers on 18 September 1856. The station had two short platforms on the main line with a very short and sharply curved platform on the branch. Goods facilities were limited, but included a brick goods shed (still in situ) with a crane. The signal box stood at the end of the platform between the branch and mainline.\n\nThe branch closed to passenger traffic on 10 September 1962, although the mainline platforms remained open for passengers until 4 January 1965. The station closed to goods on 28 June 1968, although the branch remained as a long siding to R A Lister and Company's works at Dursley until 13 July 1970.\n\nGreat Western Railway's local services operate all services at this station. A new timetable was brought out on 10 December 2006 which saw the introduction of a mostly hourly \"clockface\" service, and a considerable increase in the number of trains calling, with northbound services (on Mondays to Fridays) increased from 11 to 15 and southbound services increased from 13 to 16.

PPP–S was named after its leader Aftab Ahmad Sherpao. Differences had cropped up between PPP Chairperson Benazir Bhutto and Senior Leader Aftab Ahmad Sherpao in 1999 and the latter was expelled from the PPP by the former, thus creating PPP–S. In October 2012, it was renamed to Qaumi Watan Party when it changed its political agenda and declared itself as a Pashtun neo-nationalist party.\n\nThe name and manifesto of the party were formally changed on October 17, 2012. It was renamed from \"Pakistan Peoples Party–Sherpao\" to \"Qaumi Watan Party\". The tri-color flag was also changed by replacing the green color with white. Aftab Ahmad Sherpao said Qaumi Watan Party will work for rights of the Pashtuns of the entire region, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Karachi, Balochistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.\n\nAt the legislative elections of 20 October 2002, Pakistan Peoples Party–Sherpao won 0.3% of the popular vote and 2 out of 272 elected members. In the 2008 general election, the party won only 1 seat in the National Assembly, in which the party leader Aftab Sherpao was successful. On the other hand, it won 6 provincial assembly seats, all in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nDuring the 2013 elections the party rebranded itself as the Qaumi Watan Party and Sherpao once again won the National seat, provincially the party secured 10 seats in total, of which 8 were directly elected. This made the Qaumi Watan Party the fourth largest party in the KPK Assembly, where it currently sits with the PTI-led government coalition.\n\nThe tricolor red-black-white flag of the party exactly resembles the flag of the Kingdom of Afghanistan during the regime of Emir Habibullah Kalakani (January 1929 – October 1929). The same colors were also used by the Mongols when occupying present-day Afghanistan in the 13th century.\n\nThe QWP initially joined the coalition government in the KPK province as a junior party of Imran Khan's PTI. The PTI then parted ways on suspicions of corruption by QWP ministers.

PTI criticized QWP for such an act as the letter contained errors and the signature of Imran Khan was seen to be different from the original one. Shireen Mazari condemned the letter in a brief press release.\n\nRelations began to improve between the two party and as of 2015, QWP rejoined the PTI provincial government and its ministers re-took the oath of office, this came amongst agreement between the parties to support non-corrupt government and resulted from QWP ministers not being charged of corruption by the Ehtesab Commission.\n\n"}

The Mongolian subspecies (\"S. t. mongolica\") is found only in western Mongolia.\n\nThe scientific name of the saiga is \"Saiga tatarica\". It is the sole extant member of its genus and is classified in the family Bovidae. This species was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 12th edition of \"Systema Naturae\" (1766). Linnaeus gave it the name \"Capra tatarica\". The relationship between the saiga and the Tibetan antelope (\"Pantholops hodgsonii\") has long been debated. English zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock classified them under different subfamilies in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson classified both in the tribe Saigini under the same subfamily, Caprinae. Subsequent authors were not certain about the relationship between the two, until phylogenetic studies in the 1990s revealed that though morphologically similar, the Tibetan antelope is closer to the Caprinae while the saiga is closer to the Antilopinae.\n\nIn a revision of the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini on the basis of nuclear and mitochondrial data in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues showed that the saiga is sister to the clade formed by the springbok (\"Antidorcas marsupialis\") and the gerenuk (\"Litocranius walleri\"). The study noted that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably different from the rest of the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.\n\nTwo subspecies are recognised:\n\nFossils of saiga, concentrated mainly in central and northern Eurasia, date to as early as the late Pleistocene (nearly 0.1 Mya). An extinct species of \"Saiga\", \"S. borealis\", has been identified from the Pleistocene of northern Eurasia. Fossils excavated from the Buran Kaya III site (Crimea) date back to the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene. The morphology of saiga does not seem to have changed significantly since prehistoric times.\n\nBefore the Holocene, the saiga ranged from as far west as modern-day England and France to as far east as northern Siberia, Alaska, and probably Canada. The antelope gradually entered the Urals, though it did not colonise southern Europe. A 2010 study revealed that a steep decline has occurred in the genetic variability of the saiga since the late Pleistocene-Holocene, probably due to a population bottleneck.\n\nThe saiga stands at the shoulder, and weighs . The head-and-body length is typically between . A prominent feature of the saiga is the pair of closely spaced, bloated nostrils directed downward. Other facial features include the dark markings on the cheeks and the nose, and the long ears. During summer migrations, a saiga's nose helps filter out dust kicked up by the herd and cools the animal's blood. In the winter, it heats up the frigid air before it is taken to the lungs.\n\nThe coat shows seasonal changes. In summer, the coat appears yellow to red, fading toward the flanks. The Mongolian saiga can develop a sandy colour. The coat develops a pale, grayish-brown colour in winter, with a hint of brown on the belly and the neck. The ventral parts are generally white. The hairs, that measure long in summer, can grow as long as in winter. This forms a 12– to 15-cm-long mane on the neck. Two distinct moults can be observed in a year, one in spring (April to May) and another in autumn (late September or early October to late November or early December). The tail measures .\n\nOnly males possess horns. These horns, thick and slightly translucent, are wax-coloured and show 12 to 20 pronounced rings. With a base diameter of , the horns of the Russian saiga measure in length; the horns of the Mongolian saiga, however, reach a maximum length of .\n\nSaigas form very large herds that graze in semideserts, steppes, grasslands, and possibly open woodlands, eating several species of plants, including some that are poisonous to other animals. They can cover long distances and swim across rivers, but they avoid steep or rugged areas. The mating season starts in November, when stags fight for the acceptance of females. The winner leads a herd of five to 50 females. In springtime, mothers come together in mass to give birth. Two-thirds of births are twins; the remaining third of births are single calves.\n\nSaigas, like the Mongolian gazelles, are known for their extensive migrations across the steppes that allow them to escape natural calamities.\nSaigas are highly vulnerable to wolves. Juveniles are targeted by foxes, steppe eagles, golden eagles, dogs, and ravens.\n\nDuring the last glacial period, the saigas ranged from the British Isles through Central Asia and the Bering Strait into Alaska and Canada's Yukon and Northwest Territories. By the classical age, they were apparently considered a characteristic animal of Scythia, judging from the historian Strabo's description of an animal called the \"kolos\" that was \"between the deer and ram in size\" and was (understandably but wrongly) believed to drink through its nose.\n\nConsiderable evidence shows the importance of the antelope to Andronovo culture settlements. Illustrations of saiga antelopes can be found among the cave paintings that were dated back to seventh to fifth century BC. Moreover, saiga bones were found among the remains of other wild animals near the human settlements. \n\nThe fragmented information shows an abundance of saigas on the territory of modern Kazakhstan in the 14th-16th centuries. The migratory routes ranged throughout the country's area, especially the region between the Volga and Ural Rivers was heavily populated. Henryk Sienkiewicz mentions saiga herds in the Wild Fields of Ukraine in his epic With Fire and Sword which was set in 1647. The population's size remained high until the second half of the 19th century, when excessive horn export began. The high price and demand for horns drove radical hunting. The number of animals decreased in all regions and the migratory routes shifted southward. \n\nAfter a rapid decline, they were nearly completely exterminated in the 1920s, but they were able to recover. By 1950, two million of them were found in the steppes of the USSR. Their population fell drastically following the collapse of the USSR due to uncontrolled hunting and demand for horns in Chinese medicine. At one point, some conservation groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, encouraged the hunting of this species, as its horn was presented as an alternative to that of a rhinoceros.\n\nToday, the populations have again shrunk enormously — as much as 95% in 15 years. The saiga is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN. An estimated total number of 50,000 saigas survives today in Kalmykia, three areas of Kazakhstan, and in two isolated areas of Mongolia. Another small population in the Pre-Caspian region of Russia remains under extreme threat.\n\nCherny Zemli Nature Reserve was created in Russia's Kalmykia Republic in the 1990s to protect the local saiga population. Kalmykia's president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov announced 2010 as the Year of Saiga in Kalmykia. In Kazakhstan, the number of saigas was found to be increasing, from around 21,000 at the beginning of this millennium to around 81,000 in January 2010. However, in May 2010, an estimated 12,000 of the 26,000 saiga population in the Ural region of Kazakhstan have been found dead. Although the deaths are currently being ascribed to pasteurellosis, an infectious disease that strikes the lungs and intestines, the underlying trigger remains to be identified. In May 2015, what may be the same disease broke out in three northern regions of the country. As of 28 May 2015, more than 120,000 saigas have been confirmed dead in the Betpak-Dala population in central Kazakhstan, representing more than a third of the global population. By April, 2016, the saigas appear to be making a comeback, with an increase of population from 31,000 to 36,000 in the Betpak-Dala area.\n\nThe Mongolian saiga (\"S. t. mongolica\") is found in a small area in western Mongolia around the Sharga and Mankhan Nature Reserves.\n\nThe horn of the saiga antelope is used in traditional Chinese medicine and can sell for as much as US$150. Demand for the horns has wiped out the population in China, where the saiga antelope is a class I protected species, and drives poaching and smuggling.\n\nUnder the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Concerning Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use of the Saiga Antelope was concluded and came into effect 24 September 2006. The saiga's decline being one of the fastest population collapses of large mammals recently observed, the MoU aims to reduce current exploitation levels and restore the population status of these nomads of the Central Asian steppes.\n\nIn June 2014, Chinese customs at the Kazakh border uncovered 66 cases containing 2,351 saiga antelope horns, estimated to be worth over Y70.5 million (US$11 million). At that price, each horn would cost over US$4,600.\n\nIn June 2015, E.J. Milner-Gulland (chair of Saiga Conservation Alliance) said, \"Antipoaching needs to be a top priority for the Russian and Kazakh governments.\"\n\nSaigas have been a target of hunting since prehistoric ages, when hunting was an essential means to acquire food. Saigas' horns, meat, and skin have commercial value and are exported from Kazakhstan.\n\nSaiga horn, known as , is one of the main ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine that is used as an extract or powder additive to the elixirs, ointments, and drinks. Saiga horn's value is equal to rhinoceros horn, whose trade was banned in 1993. is thought to be a cheaper substitute of rare rhino horn in most TCM recipes. Although the hunting and trade is considered illegal, the horn products still can be found sold publicly and openly in a great variety of venues and businesses.\n\nIn the period from 1955 to 1989, over 87 thousand tonnes of meat were collected in Kazakhstan by killing more than five million saiga.\nIn 2011, Kazakhstan reaffirmed a ban on hunting saiga and extended this ban until 2021.\n\nSaiga meat is compared to lamb, considered to be nutritious and delicious. Numerous recipes for cooking the antelope's meat can be found. Both meat and byproducts are sold in the country and outside of it. About 45–80 dm² of skin can be yielded from one individual depending on its age and sex. The skin is used to produce suede and box calf.\n\nAgricultural advancement and human settlements have been shrinking habitat areas of the saigas since the 20th century. Occupants limited saiga's passage to water resources and the winter and summer habitats. The ever-changing face of steppe requires saigas to search for new routes to their habitual lands. Currently, saiga populations' migratory routes pass five countries and different man-made constructions, such as railways, trenches, mining sites, and pipelines. These physical barriers limit movement of the antelopes. Cases of saiga herds being trapped within fenced areas and starving to death have been reported. Starting in 2011, Kazakhstan has built more than 150 km of wire fence at the border with Uzbekistan. This fence limits seasonal migration of saigas and other smaller animals. Although concerns have been stated, the fences are still being built.\n\nSaigas are dependent on weather and affected by climate fluctuations to a great extent due to their migratory nature. Harsh winters with strong winds or high snow coverage disable feeding on the grass under the thick snow. Population size usually dramatically decreases after severe cold months. Recent trends in climate change lead to increasing aridity of the steppe region, thus, deficiency of the grazing pastureland. An estimate of 14% or more of available pastureland is considered degraded and useless. Consequently, small steppe rivers dry faster, limiting water resources to large lakes and rivers, which are usually populated by human settlements. Moreover, high temperatures in the steppe region lead to springtime floods, in which saiga calves can drown.\n\nFor ungulates, mass mortalities are not uncommon. In the 1980s, several saiga die-offs occurred, and between 2010 and 2014, one occurred every year. The deaths could be linked to calving aggregation, which is when they are most vulnerable. More recent research involving a mass die-off in 2015 indicates warmer weather and attendant humidity caused bacteria common in saiga antelopes to move into the bloodstream and cause hemorrhagic septicemia.\n\nIn May 2015, uncommonly large numbers of saigas began to die from a mysterious epizootic illness suspected to be pasteurellosis. Herd fatality is 100% once infected, with an estimated 40% of the species' total population already dead. More than 120,000 carcasses had been found by late May 2015, while the estimated total population was only 250,000.\n\nBiologist Murat Nurushev suggested that the cause might be acute ruminal tympany, whose symptoms (bloating, mouth foaming, and diarrhea) had been observed in dead saiga antelopes. According to Nurushev, this disease occurred as a result of foraging on a large amount of easily fermenting plants (alfalfa, clover, sainfoins, and mixed wet, green grass). In May 2015, the United Nations agency which is involved in saiga conservation efforts issued a statement that the mass die-off had ended. By June 2015, no definitive cause for the epizootic had been found.\n\nAt a scientific meeting in November 2015 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Dr. Richard A. Kock (of the Royal Veterinary College in London) reported that his colleagues and he had narrowed down the possible culprits. Climate change and stormy spring weather, they said, may have transformed harmless bacteria, carried by the saigas, into lethal pathogens.\n\n\"Pasteurella multocida\", a bacterium, was determined to be the cause of death. The bacterium occurs in the antelopes and is normally harmless; the reason for the change in behavior of the bacterium is unknown.\n\nNow, scientists and researchers believe the unusually warm and wet uncontrolled environmental variables caused the bacterium to enter the bloodstream and become septic. Hemorrhagic septicemia is the likely cause of the most recent deaths The change of the bacteria may be attributed to \"the response of opportunistic microbes to changing environmental conditions\".\n\nThe Betpak-Dala saiga population in central Kazakhstan, which had the most deaths, increased from 31,000 after the epidemic to 36,000 by April 2016.\n\nIn late 2016, a large loss of the population happened in Mongolia. The etiology was confirmed to be goat plague in early 2017.\n\nCurrently, only the Moscow Zoo and Askania-Nova keep saigas. Cologne Zoological Garden and San Diego Zoo had them in the past. Pleistocene Park in northern Siberia plans to introduce the species.\n\n\n"}

He then attended the Sophiengymnasium (a Berlin gymnasium) yet was expelled after clashing with the headteacher. He finished his school days in Danzig and, subsequently, studied the natural sciences, economics, literature, and philosophy at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in Berlin and then at Leipzig University, where he obtained a doctorate in economics with a thesis on the insurance industry. He then worked as a secretary at a fire insurance association, and remained in this position until, after the publication of his second volume of poetry, he turned full-time writer.\n\nIn 1889, Dehmel married Paula Oppenheimer, sister of Franz Oppenheimer. He became active as a writer and co-founded \"Pan\" magazine in 1894. Dehmel divorced Paula in 1899 and traveled Europe with Ida Auerbach (née Coblentz), who had formerly been engaged to Dehmel's rival Stefan George. Dehmel married Ida in 1901, and that same year they settled in Hamburg.\n\nDehmel's poetic volume \"Weib und Welt\" (\"Woman and World\") triggered a scandal in the late 1890s: denounced by the deeply conservative poet Börries von Münchhausen, Dehmel was tried for obscenity and blasphemy. Despite being acquitted on technical grounds, the court condemned the work as obscene and blasphemous and ordered that it be burned. Dehmel would again be prosecuted for obscenity and blasphemy, but again acquitted as earlier.\n\nDehmel was a champion of the rights of workers. However, despite his record of fighting conservatives, Dehmel joined the many patriotic and pro-war German intellectuals who invoked the masses to support the German Empire after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Fifty-one at the time, Dehmel volunteered in 1914 and served until 1916, when he was wounded. He called on the Germans to keep fighting right until 1918. Dehmel died in 1920 in Blankenese from the after-effects of an injury sustained during the war.\n\nDehmel is considered one of the foremost German poets of the pre-World War I era. His poems are finished in form and use numerous metrical patterns. They were set to music by composers such as Richard Strauss (who met his principal librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal at Dehmel's house), Max Reger, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Oskar Fried, Alma Mahler, Anton Webern, Ignatz Waghalter, Carl Orff, and Kurt Weill, or they inspired them to write music. Dehmel's main theme was \"love and sex (Eros)\", which he framed as a power to break away from middle-class values and fetters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2275708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275708", "title": "Authoritarian personality", "text": "Authoritarian personality\n\nThe authoritarian personality is a personality type characterized by extreme obedience and unquestioning respect for and submission to the authority of a person external to the self, which is realized through the oppression of subordinate people. Conceptually, the term \"authoritarian personality\" originated from the writings of Erich Fromm, and usually is applied to men and women who exhibit a strict and oppressive personality towards their subordinates.\n\nIn \"The Authoritarian Personality\" (1950), Theodor W. Adorno and Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson and Nevitt Sanford proposed a personality type that involved the \"potentially fascistic individual.\" The historical background that influenced the theoretical development of the authoritarian personality included the rise of fascism in the 1930s, the Second World War (1939–1945), and the Holocaust, which indicated that the fascistic individual was psychologically susceptible to the ideology of anti-Semitism and to the emotional appeal of anti-democratic politics. Known as the Berkeley studies, the researches of Adorno and Frenkel-Brunswik, and of Levinson and Sanford concentrated upon prejudice, which they studied within psychoanalytic and psychosocial frameworks of Freudian and Frommian theories.\n\nThe authoritarian personality has a strict superego, which controls a weak ego that is unable to cope with the strong impulses of the id. The resulting intrapsychic conflicts cause personal insecurities, which result in the superego adhering to externally imposed conventional norms (conventionalism), and unquestioning obedience to the authorities who impose and administer the social norms of society (authoritarian submission). The ego-defense mechanism of psychological projection arises when the authoritarian person avoids self-reference to the anxiety-producing impulse(s) of the id, by projecting the impulse(s) onto the \"inferior\" minority social-groups of the culture (projectivity), which are expressed by way of greatly evaluative and harshly judgemental beliefs (power and toughness) and rigid (stereotypy).\n\nThe authoritarian person also presents a cynical and disdainful view of humanity, and a need to wield power and be tough, which arise from the anxieties produced by the perceived lapses of people who do not abide by the conventions and social norms of society (destructiveness and cynicism); a general tendency to focus upon people who violate the value system, and to act oppressively against them (authoritarian aggression); anti-intellectualism, a general opposition to the subjective and imaginative tendencies of the mind (anti-intraception); a tendency to believe in mystic determination (superstition); and an exaggerated concern with sexual promiscuity.\nIn human psychological development, the formation of the authoritarian personality occurs within the first years of a child's life, strongly influenced and shaped by the parents' personalities and the organizational structure of the child's family; thus, parent-child relations that are \"hierarchical, authoritarian, [and] exploitative\" can result in a child developing an authoritarian personality. Authoritarian-personality characteristics are fostered by parents who have a psychological need for domination, and who harshly threaten their child to compel obedience to conventional behaviors. Moreover, such domineering parents also are preoccupied with social status, a concern they communicate by having the child follow rigid, external rules. In consequence of such domination, the child suffers emotionally from the suppression of his or her feelings of aggression and resentment towards the domineering parents, whom the child reverently idealizes, but does not criticize.\n\nAccording to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of gender inequality and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.\n\nBob Altemeyer used the right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) scale, to identify, measure, and quantify the personality traits of authoritarian people. The political personality type identified with the RWA scale indicates the existence of three psychological tendencies and attitudinal clusters characteristic of the authoritarian personality: (i) Submission to legitimate authorities; (ii) Aggression towards minority groups whom authorities identified as targets for sanctioned political violence; and (iii) Adherence to cultural values and political beliefs endorsed by the authorities. As measured with the NEO-PI-R Openness scale, the research indicates a negative correlation (r=0.57) between the personality trait of \"openness to experience\", of the Five Factor Model of the human personality.\n\nThe research of Jost, Glaser, Arie W. Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003) indicates that authoritarianism and right-wing authoritarianism are ideological constructs for social cognition, by which political conservatives view people who are the Other who is not the Self. That the authoritarian personality and the conservative personality share two, core traits: (i) resistance to change (social, political. economic), and (ii) justification for social inequality among the members of society. That conservatives have psychological needs to manage existential uncertainty and threat with situational motives (striving for dominance in social hierarchies) and with dispositional motives (self-esteem and the management of fear).\n\nThe research on ideology, politics, and racist prejudice, by John Duckitt and Chris Sibley, identified two types of authoritarian worldview: (i) that the social world is dangerous, which leads to right-wing authoritarianism; and (ii) that the world is a ruthlessly competitive jungle, which leads to social dominance orientation. In a meta-analysis of the research, Sibley and Duckitt explained that the social-dominance orientation scale helps to measure the generalization of prejudice and other authoritarian attitudes that can exist within social groups. Although both the right-wing authoritarianism scale and the social-dominance orientation scale can accurately measure authoritarian personalities, the scales usually are not correlated. \n\nThese researchers' most noteworthy measurement for authoritarianism is the \"F-scale\", designed to tap a set of beliefs thought to be associated with authoritarianism without the need for specific out-groups indicated. Kirscht and Dillehay (1967) outlined several problems with the Berkeley studies, including response bias. Response bias results from the F scale being uniformly worded in a confirming direction. Hence, if one tends to respond in agreement with items, regardless of their content, one is rated as an authoritarian by such a test. Several studies have shown that more variance of the F scale can be explained by response bias than the content of the items (Kirscht & Dillehay, 1967).\n\nActual assessment of 16 Nazi criminals at Nuremberg trials (reported in Zillmer, \"et al.\", 1995) conducted by clinicians using the Rorschach inkblots, and in one study, the F scale for authoritarianism, found that these ex-Nazis score high on three dimensions (anti-intraception, superstition and stereotyping, and projectivity), but not all nine dimensions as the theory predicted.\n\nOne of the first applications of the authoritarian scales in academia was by Stern and colleagues, in the early 1950s, at the University of Chicago. The hypothesized prediction was that \"authoritarian\" students would have difficulty in the sciences and humanities, and use of an attitudinal scale was a successful predictor.\n\nAmong the criticisms of the sociologic theory presented in \"The Authoritarian Personality\" (1950) are the validity of the psychoanalytic interpretation of personality; methodological inadequacies of the California F-scale personality test; and bias that authoritarianism exists only in the right wing of the political spectrum. In addition an analysis examining the authoritarian personality approach written by C.G. Sibley and J. Duckitt reported that more recent research has produced two more effective scales of measurement for authoritative personalities. The first scale is called the Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and the second is called the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). They have proved to be highly reliable in predicting prejudice and other characteristics associated with authoritative personalities. In \"The Anti-authoritarian Personality\" (1977) W.P. Kreml found stylistic similarities between authoritarians and anti-authoritarians (dogmatism, rigidity, etc.), and that variable constructs, such as (a) the relative need for order, (b) the relative need for power, (c) the rejection or acceptance of impulse, and (d) extroversion-versus-introversion, differentiated the two types of personality, and could underpin a full-spectrum psycho-political theory.\n\nWiggins provided an insightful explanation of how the authoritarian construct is an example of the synthetic approach to personality assessment. In short, in the synthetic approach, the assumption is that those with authoritarian personality characteristics are assessed with researcher's intuitive model of what characteristics fit the criterion role requirements of the predicted situation (support of Fascism). Hence, it is not a completely empirical approach to prediction, but rather based on \"arm chair\" situational analysis of the criteria, and intuited psychological characteristics to be assessed that fit the situation. More recently, Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003) have presented how the traditional research in authoritarianism or conservatism has confounded the psychological variables (e.g., personality characteristics) with the political criteria (conservative attitudes). Hence the scales measuring individual differences on authoritarianism often include the criteria attitudinal statements of political ideologies.\n\nThe personality construct for the authoritarian personality proposed that the social environment influenced the expression of prejudice, based upon the social forces of the time, because the authoritarian person's ideology is created within the culture. Yet, in \"The Social Being and Social Psychology\" (1998) S. Taylor said that the hypothesized interaction of society and the authoritarian person was lost to the subsequent research that used the F-scale in differential psychological studies. Given the science of personality assessment, the variety of methods Adorno, \"et al.\" used are now unsupported, and might explain that lack of empirical studies using the F scale or the other scales developed by Adorno \"et al.\" in subsequent research. An example of the social environment impact is presented by Gibb (1969) in his critique of personality traits and leadership, where a study by Katz suggested that the social situation can override personality differences. In the study, groups of black and white students were formed. Some mixed racial groups had students scoring high authoritarian F scores, and in other mixed groups, low F score students. Comparisons of high authoritarian white students to those not scoring authoritarian indicated that the former student type were more cooperative and less willing to endorse stereotypes towards blacks. Situational norms against prejudicial perceptions might have influenced authoritarian students to act less prejudicial in order to conform to the prescribed norm. Altenmeyer's analytical research indicated that of the nine personality components hypothesized, only three components correlated: (i) authoritarian submission, (ii) authoritarian aggression, and (iii) conventionalism.\n\n"}

He was taught how to play the alto saxophone in his teens by his older brother Lucian Adams, inspired (like many jazz musicians of his generation) by Charlie Parker.

In 1956 Coleman moved to Chicago, along with Booker Little, where he worked with Gene Ammons and Johnny Griffin before joining Max Roach's quintet (1958–1959). Coleman recorded with organist Jimmy Smith on his album \"House Party\" (1957), along with Lee Morgan, Curtis Fuller, Kenny Burrell, and Donald Bailey. Moving to New York City with Max Roach in that year, he went on to play with Slide Hampton (1959–1962), Ron Carter, Jimmy Cobb, and Wild Bill Davis (1962), before joining Miles Davis' quintet in 1963–1964.\n\nHis albums with Davis (and the rhythm section of Herbie Hancock (piano), Ron Carter (bass), and Tony Williams (drums)) are \"Seven Steps to Heaven\" (1963), \"A Rare Home Town Appearance\" (1963), \"Côte Blues\" (1963), \"In Europe\" (1963), \"My Funny Valentine\", and \"Four & More\", both live recordings of a concert in Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City in February 1964. Shortly after this concert, Coleman was replaced by Wayne Shorter. Nevertheless, Davis retained a high opinion of Coleman's playing, stating that \"George played everything almost perfectly...He was a hell of a musician.\" Coleman played with Lionel Hampton (1965–1966), also in 1965 on Chet Baker's \"The Prestige Sessions\", with Kirk Lightsey, Herman Wright, and Roy Brooks. Clark Terry, Horace Silver, Elvin Jones (1968), Shirley Scott (1972), Cedar Walton (1975), Charles Mingus (1977–1978), Ahmad Jamal (1994, 2000), and many others.\n\nColeman also appeared in the science-fiction film \"Freejack\" (1992), starring Emilio Estevez, Mick Jagger, and Anthony Hopkins; and 1996's \"The Preacher's Wife\", with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston.\n\nColeman recorded into the 2000s. His CD as co-leader, \"Four Generations of Miles: A Live Tribute To Miles\", with bassist Ron Carter, drummer Jimmy Cobb and guitarist Mike Stern was released on Chesky Records in October 2002, and it concentrates almost exclusively on the 1950s repertoire of Miles Davis. Tracks include: \"There Is No Greater Love\", \"All Blues\", \"On Green Dolphin Street\", \"Blue in Green\", \"81\", \"Freddie Freeloader\", \"My Funny Valentine\", \"If I Were a Bell\", and \"Oleo\". He was featured on Joey DeFrancesco's 2006 release \"Organic Vibes\", along with vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, Billboard's Top Jazz Album Chart, peaked to No. 17.\n\nColeman was married to jazz organist Gloria Coleman and is father to jazz drummer George Coleman Jr.\n\nHe was named an NEA Jazz Master and to the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015, and received a brass note on the Beale Street Brass Notes Walk of Fame.\n\nWith Chet Baker\nWith Roy Brooks\nWith Paul (PB) Brown\nWith Brian Charette\nWith Miles Davis\nWith Joey DeFrancesco\nWith Charles Earland\nWith Red Garland\nWith Slide Hampton\nWith Herbie Hancock\nWith Johnny Hartman\nWith Ahmad Jamal\nWith Elvin Jones\nWith Booker Little\nWith Harold Mabern\nWith Jack McDuff\nWith Charles Mingus\nWith Lee Morgan\nWith Idris Muhammad\nWith Don Patterson\nWith John Patton\nWith Duke Pearson\nWith Max Roach\nWith Shirley Scott\nWith Jimmy Smith\n With Louis Smith\nWith Melvin Sparks\nWith Charles Tolliver\nWith Roseanna Vitro\nWith Mal Waldron\nWith Cedar Walton\nWith Reuben Wilson\n\n"}

However, during World War I and World War II, the house found use as a military hospital. Hugh Seymour, 8th Marquess of Hertford, who inherited Ragley Hall from his uncle in 1940, fought to save it after the war.

He is best known for being a member of the tag team Phi Delta Slam as well as his appearances in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. In early 2009 he returned to TNA under ring name Big Rocco as one half of The Main Event Mafia's (and later Mick Foley's) personal security force.\n\nTilly worked for World Championship Wrestling throughout the mid-1990s as a jobber. He later began wrestling primarily on the Floridian independent circuit, where he formed a tag team with Bruno Sassi known as Phi Delta Slam. Phi Delta Slam used the gimmick of a pair of boisterous fraternity members.\n\nPhi Delta Slam were introduced to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) after Dusty Rhodes told his two competing assistants, Traci Brooks and Trinity, to each find a tag team. The tag teams would wrestle one another at Destination X, with the winning tag team's sponsor becoming Rhodes' sole assistant. Trinity selected Phi Delta Slam, and they debuted in February 2005, wrestling dark matches. They made their on-screen debut on March 13 at Destination X, where they lost to Traci's choice, The Harris Brothers. Phi Delta Slam remained in TNA for several weeks afterwards, but were unable to get over with fans, and began appearing only sporadically with the promotion. In September 2005, their profiles were removed from the TNA website, confirming that the team was gone from TNA.\n\nTilly and Sassi later made a cameo appearance in a series of comedy segments on the December 20, 2007 episode of \"Impact!\" where they were seen at Eric Young's Christmas party, which also involved the likes of Luke Williams, Kevin Nash, ODB, and Awesome Kong.\n\nIn early 2009, both Tilly and Sassi returned to TNA as the personal security of The Main Event Mafia in order to help them fend off The TNA Front Line. In order play into the mafia aspect of the stable, Tilly was renamed to Rocco (before it was later tweaked to Big Rocco), he began wearing sunglasses at all times, he dyed his normally brown hair to black and began sporting a goatee. On the March 13 edition of \"Impact!\", Sal and Kurt Angle accompanied Rocco as he wrestled Front Line member Eric Young in the main event, which he lost after Young pinned him following a Death Valley driver. On the April 2 edition of \"Impact!\", Rocco and Sal challenged and lost to Team 3D. On the May 7 edition of \"Impact!\" they were defeated in a handicap match by Matt Morgan. On the May 28 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting, the new leader of the Main Event Mafia, fired Rocco and Sal. On the June 4, 2009, edition of \"Impact!\" Rocco and Sal were hired by Mick Foley. The two of them have since made only sporadic appearances as security men.\n\nOn August 8, 2010, at ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, Tilquist portrayed a fake version of The Blue Meanie, using the name Blue Tilly, and, along with Hollywood Nova, accompanied Stevie Richards to the ring. Later in the night Tilly and Nova attacked Tommy Dreamer during his match with Raven.\n\nPhi Delta Slam is currently wrestling with the South Florida based Coastal Championship Wrestling.

{"id": "2275763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275763", "title": "Alief, Houston", "text": "Alief, Houston\n\nAlief ( ) is a large suburban community in southwestern Harris County, Texas, United States, mostly within the city limits of Houston. Portions of Alief are in Southwest Houston while other portions of Alief are within unincorporated Harris County.\n\nFirst settled along the banks of Brays Bayou in 1861 as a small farming community named Dairy, Alief slowly matured into a local commercial center by the end of the 19th century. Its population fluctuated between 100 and 200 until the 1960s, when the suburbanization of Houston brought significant amounts of development to the area. The community was annexed by the city of Houston in the 1970s, having failed to incorporate itself. During the 1970s energy crisis, which saw the price of oil reach record highs, Alief experienced rapid and immense population growth, stimulated by the construction of new corporate campuses and the resettlement of Vietnamese refugees in Houston. Alief has become notable for its independent school district, ethnic diversity, and relatively high crime rate.\n\nIn 1861, Reynolds Reynolds claimed of land near Brays Bayou. The land was sold to Jacamiah Seaman Daugherty in 1888 and in the following year, he allowed the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway to build on his land. Daugherty sold his land in 1893 to Francis Meston who planned to engineer a community. Daugherty stayed to oversee land sales in Meston's Houston office. In 1894, the community was surveyed and recognized by Harris County. Surveyors named the town Dairy, Texas. The first two town settlers, Dr. John S. Magee and his wife, Alief Ozelda Magee, moved from Ellis County to Dairy the same year.\nAlief Ozelda Magee, acting as the town's first postmistress, applied to open the first post office in 1895. On August 16, 1895, the post office opened. The postal service referred to the office as \"Alief\" in her honor to help avoid confusion with mail intended for the similarly named town of Daisy, Texas. The site of the post office, which was operated from her home, was honored with a Texas State Historical Marker in 1990. The marker (number 10644) is located on the south side of 7th Street between F Street and G Street.\n\nMeston deeded property to Dr. John S. Magee, Newton Gentry, and Hardy Price for use as a cemetery in 1900. Alief Ozelda Magee, who died in 1899, is buried in the cemetery. The cemetery is located at what is now the intersection of Bellaire Blvd. and Dairy Ashford. The Texas Historical Commission recognized Alief Cemetery with a historical marker (number 10589) in 1984.\n\nThe Flood of 1899 and the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 destroyed the Methodist Episcopal Church along with the town's cotton and corn crops, forcing 24 of the 30 families that resided in Alief to relocate. The town reverted to prairie and wolves openly roamed during daytime. Daugherty found a positive side to the flooding; He persuaded the remaining six families that rice was better suited to grow in Alief's flood plains than previous crops and spent his own money to help cultivate the first rice crops. Daugherty succeeded: his rice became an instant cash crop that persuaded many to return to Alief. In 1901, Alief's first immigrant families, a small group of Germans arrived. In 1904, the majority of those who had left in the wake of the 1900 hurricane returned. The rapid growth period created a commercial district along the railroad tracks, convincing the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway to construct a depot.\n\nDue to its propensity for flooding, the citizens established the Harris County Flood Control District in Alief in 1909. The chairman of the Harris County Drainage District was Daugherty. Trustees S.B. (Shorter) Burleson and Will and Eddie Garmond for the Prairie Grove Missionary Baptist Church purchased land in 1910 which would later become the church's home. The historic African American church's congregation met in the home of S.B. (Shorter) Burleson before the construction of the sanctuary. Credit for the church's name is primarily attributed to Mamie Burleson. In 1911, the Dairy School District was established and a three-story school was built.\n\nThe town was officially renamed \"Alief, Texas\" in 1917 and the Dairy School District became the Alief Independent School District (Alief ISD).\n\nAutomobiles arrived in Alief by 1920. The sanctuary for Prairie Grove Missionary Baptist Church was constructed between 1921 and 1922. The Cane Belt Canal, which \"ran from the Brazos River, eight miles north of Richmond, through Alief and south to Alvin,\" according to the Westchase District, was completed in 1934. Daugherty promoted the canal, which was used for irrigation by rice farmers. The year after the canal was completed, Alief obtained electricity. Education in Alief was segregated. From 1927 to 1937, African American children used Prairie Grove Missionary Baptist Church's sanctuary as a schoolhouse. Previously, African American children attended school in a one-room schoolhouse. Alief ISD's three-story schoolhouse was condemned in 1939, and its students attended classes in a nearby building until a new school annex was added in 1940. Also in 1940, Melissa Outley died. Melissa Outley was married to David Outley. He was the first African American educator in Alief. Hers is the first known burial in Prairie Grove Cemetery, which was adjacent to Prairie Grove Missionary Baptist Church. The church's sanctuary was demolished in the 1940s as attendance fell. Alief Community Church first opened its doors in 1941. Population fluctuated wildly, ranging from a low of 35 in the 1930s to 200 by 1942. Alief acquired telephone service in 1943. E.W.K. \"Andy\" Andrau opened Andrau Airpark in 1946. In 1964, Alief ISD built its oldest remaining school, Alief Elementary School (later renamed for teacher Cynthia Youens). By the same year, oilman Robert E. \"Bob\" Smith owned 11,000 acres of land including what is now the Westchase area.\n\nIn 1970, Alief was still primarily pastureland and major thoroughfares, such as the Sam Houston Tollway, were still gravel roads. The 1970s were a prosperous time for Houston, and Alief continued to grow as people came to the area in search of housing. Houston began expanding westward with the development of River Oaks and Memorial, and the trend continued to Alief. Many of the new residents were low-income apartment dwellers. The community's population increased by a factor of four between 1970 and 1985. Between 1980 and 1985, approximately a third of the population growth experienced by Harris County occurred in the southwest quadrant of the county bounded by the Katy and South (288) freeways, with Alief accounting for half of that, or one-sixth of the overall growth of the county during that five-year time frame. The Alief Independent School District struggled to find room for all of the new students.\n\nAs the population of Alief increased in the 1980s, the community began to diversify. In 1978, close to 80% of the people in the community were white. Less than 4% of the people in the community were African American. The shift was primarily for socio-economic reasons. Many low-income Spanish-speaking immigrants settled in traditionally low-income areas of Houston inside Loop 610. Many African-Americans who could afford to left traditional African-American neighborhoods to move to Alief and other parts of Southwest Houston during the 1980s. White people who could afford to move to newer suburbs further from Houston than Alief began to leave the community. In addition, many people of Asian ancestry settled in Alief, Sharpstown, and Westwood, creating one of the largest Asian-American concentrations in Houston. Southwest Houston's Asian population included mainly immigrants from China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Korea. In addition, Southwest Houston became home to many people from Taiwan, the Philippines, Japan, Laos, and Indonesia. By the late 1980s, white students accounted for less than half of the students enrolled in Alief ISD.\n\nIn addition changes in population and demographic, the community underwent several other important changes. Robert E. \"Bob\" Smith died in 1973, and his widow sold 760 acres of land to the Westchase Corporation which began developing the Westchase District. Houston began annexing Alief in 1977. The City of Houston voted to annex the Alief-Fondren area on November 23, 1977. In 1978, Brown and Root built a large engineering complex at the corner of Bellaire Blvd. and Beltway 8. Houston continued to annex pieces of Alief into the 1980s. West Oaks Mall opened in 1984 and was annexed by the City of Houston the same year. The community feared that annexation would lead to neglect by Houston's government and protested further annexations. Despite these efforts, Houston succeeded in annexing most of the area. Agriculture began to fade. The last cotton gin in Alief closed in 1976, and the area ceased growing cotton altogether by 1982. Alief was one of the last places where cotton had been grown in Harris County. Dairy, cattle, vegetable production, and rice production also declined. Urban development took the place of agriculture. In the spring of 1985, Houston Fire Station #76 was opened to serve the Alief area. The Alief Branch Library (since renamed the David M. Henington-Alief Regional Library) was also opened in 1985. As a sign of the community's growing diversity, the \"Houston Chronicle\" noted that the library staff spoke, \"a variety of languages, including Hindi, Mandarin Chinese and Farsi (referring to Persian),\" when the library first opened. West Houston Medical Center was constructed in 1985 as well. The Alief General Hospital building was abandoned. The Fame City entertainment complex and water park (which later became Fun Plex and Adventure Bay) held its grand opening in 1986. Fame City featured roller skating, movie theaters, a sound studio, miniature golf, bumper-cars, bowling, alley, games, rides, an arcade, restaurants and shops indoors, and a 10-acre water park outdoors. The Alief Brown and Root building closed in May 1987, but was reopened in November 1988 when the industry saw increased growth. Andrau Airpark was sold to the Camden Trust in 1988, although the airport continued to operate.\n\nThe size and diversity of Alief's population continued to grow. Alief's population increased by 45% from 1990 to 2005. By 1991, Alief ISD was growing at a rate of approximately 1,500 new students per year. Houston City Council District F (which included Alief and Sharpstown) had a population that was approximately 46% white with quickly growing African American, Hispanic, and Asian segments. Previously, District F had a mostly white population. Alief ISD's student population was 24% African American by 1991. By 1993, there were 34% more Asian businesses than there had been in 1982. Canterbury United Methodist Church began offering services in Vietnamese in 1995. By 1996, Alief was one of the most ethnically diverse school districts in the country. The district's students spoke a total of 57 different languages. Christ the King Episcopal Church was offering an \"African Thanksgiving Feast\" since many of the church members had African heritage. The district's main high schools, Hastings and Elsik, were the two largest high schools in Texas. Alief ISD estimated a total enrollment of 39,000 students in the district, with 8,582 students attending either Hastings or Elsik. Mik Giglio of the \"Houston Press\" said in 2000 that in 1997 Alief \"was a blend of its affluent, white former self and the predominantly poor, ethnic enclave it has since become.\"\n\nBy 1997, street signs in Alief near Bellaire and Corporate were in both English and Chinese. The Chinese signs had the Chinese phonetic pronunciations of the English names so that English and Chinese speakers could understand each other. In 1997, Hong Kong Development announced plans to build a center called Hong Kong City at the corner of Bellaire and Boone. The developers hoped that building west of Beltway 8 would move the center of the growing Asian business community further west. The Hong Kong City Mall opened in 1999. At the same time that the African American, Hispanic, and Asian populations increased, the white population decreased. Researchers cited social class differences as the reason most white people moved away from Alief. People with greater financial means of all ethnicities moved to further outlying suburbs with greater amenities and better performing schools during the period, while people with lesser financial means moved into the area to take advantage of newer housing and better amenities and schools than those that they left behind. The change was seen disproportionately in the white population since the white population was disproportionately wealthier. Allen G. Breed of the \"Associated Press\" wrote: \"Alief is an impoverished, multicultural enclave where many of the business and street signs are in both English and one of several Asian languages. The district's 47,000 students speak nearly 70 tongues, and the number of students qualifying for free or reduced lunch over 70%.\".\n\nMany developments in education took place in the 1990s in Alief. In 1993, Alief ISD instituted a rule which made passing the statewide standardized test, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) Exit Exam, a requirement for high school graduation. Many parents protested the measure. In 1995, voters decided to allow Alief ISD to build the Hastings and Elsik Ninth Grade Centers. In 1998, voters approved funds for Alief ISD to use to build a new high school, which would later become Alief \"Doc\" Taylor. The period was also marked with political scandals. In 1991, a ballot box from the Boone Elementary polling location containing over 700 ballots went missing after the poll closed.\n\nIn late 1994, David M. Henington, the director of the Houston Public Library, retired. In an article about his retirement plans he told the reporter he wanted personal computers placed in all of Houston's branch libraries so that all Houstonians could access the internet \"information superhighway\" during their visits. In 1996, the Henington-Alief Library began offering free internet access to the public. The service was text-only and was limited to 20 minutes when other users were waiting to use the computers. The move by the Houston Public Library was intended to bring internet access to Houstonians who did not have a home computer and therefore did not have home access to the internet.\n\nIn 2005, Alief became home to many Hurricane Katrina evacuees. More than 3,000 evacuees enrolled in Alief ISD schools. Alief ISD spent $12 million to accommodate Hurricane Katrina evacuees in 2005. The United States government promised to reimburse the district, but in 2006 Alief had not yet received the money. Many of the students who were displaced by the hurricane were academically behind their Texas peers. In 2006, former United States President George H. W. Bush and Houston Mayor Bill White led a fundraising campaign to help Alief ISD and other districts pay for educating the displaced students. The influx of evacuees caused an escalation of gang violence. Murders in Houston increased by 29% in 2005.\n\nIn the first 1991 Mayor of Houston election, most Alief voters voted for Bob Lanier. However, in the community Sylvester Turner, Lanier's opponent, had a large second-most following in terms of votes. In 2008, M. J. Khan represented the District F (which includes Alief). By December 3, 1991, increases in crime and changes of demographics in southwestern Houston neighborhoods led to many challengers desiring to fill the city council seat of District F.\n\nThe Alief Community Association defines the boundaries of Alief as, \"Westheimer on the north, Sam Houston Tollway on the east, Fort Bend County Line on the west and Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 on the south,\" while the Alief Independent School District boundaries extend as far east as Gessner in some places. The Alief Super Neighborhood Council (ASNC) and the International Management District (IMD) have their own boundaries.\n\nAlief is partially annexed by the City of Houston, and partially unincorporated. This section pertains only to the annexed portion of Alief. Please see the \"County\" section for unincorporated Alief.\n\nAs of 2011 Houston City Council District F covers the parts of Alief in Houston.\n\nThe portion of Alief in Houston is within Super Neighborhood #25 Alief. Its recognized council was established on June 25, 2000. Each super neighborhood represents a group of civic clubs, places of worship, businesses, and other institutions and community interests.\n\nIn 2015 the Houston portion of the Alief Super Neighborhood had 106,657 people, with 7,544 people per square mile. 49% were Hispanic, 22% were non-Hispanic black, 19% were non-Hispanic Asians, 9% were non-Hispanic whites, and 1% were non-Hispanic others. The median income was $46,187.\n\nThe annexed portion of Alief had a population of 108,971 people which was growing at a rate of 1.15% annually in 2009. The City of Houston stated on its website that the \"legendary diversity\" in Alief \"is evident in the large section of Asian residents and businesses along Bellaire Boulevard.\" According to the Alief Independent School District in 2011, \"Virtually every culture of the modern world is represented in [the district's] 45,000 student enrollment; more than 80 languages and dialects are spoken\" among its students.\n\nThe population of??? was 11.1% white(non-Hispanic), 28.4% black(non-Hispanic), 21.2% Asian, and 37.9% Hispanic in the annexed portion of Alief in 2009. The number of Asians and Hispanics in the annexed portion of Alief increased between the years 2000 and 2009 while the number of people from all other ethnic groups listed by the City of Houston Planning Department either declined or showed no change. The number of households in the annexed portion of Alief increased from 31,033 in 2000 to 33,654 in 2009. The average size of households in the area increased as well, from 3.15 to 3.22. The median age of residents in the annexed portion of Alief was 29.6 in 2009.

During a recording career that spanned 40 years, from 1926 to the mid-1960s, she worked with Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, Clarence Williams, Luis Russell, Lonnie Johnson, and Bob Dylan. She also performed in vaudeville and clubs, sometimes with her sister Addie \"Sweet Peas\" (or \"Sweet Pease\") Spivey (1910–1943), also known as the Za Zu Girl. Among her compositions are \"Black Snake Blues\" (1926), \"Dope Head Blues\" (1927), and \"Organ Grinder Blues\" (1928). In 1962 she co-founded Spivey Records.\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas, she was the daughter of Grant and Addie (Smith) Spivey. Her father was a part-time musician and a flagman for the railroad; her mother was a nurse. She had two sisters, both of whom also sang professionally: Addie \"Sweet Peas\" (or \"Sweet Pease\") Spivey (1910–1943), who recorded for several major record labels between 1929 and 1937, and Elton Island Spivey Harris (1900–1971).\n\nSpivey's first professional experience was in a family string band led by her father in Houston. After he died, the seven-year-old Victoria played on her own at local parties. In 1918, she was hired to accompany films at the Lincoln Theater in Dallas. As a teenager, she worked in local bars, nightclubs, and buffet flats, mostly alone, but occasionally with singer-guitarists, including Blind Lemon Jefferson. In 1926 she moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where she was signed by Okeh Records. Her first recording, \"Black Snake Blues\" (1926), sold well, and her association with the label continued. She recorded numerous sides for Okeh in New York City until 1929, when she switched to the Victor label. Between 1931 and 1937, more recordings followed for Vocalion Records and Decca Records, and, working out of New York, she maintained an active performance schedule. Her recorded accompanists included King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Lonnie Johnson, and Red Allen.\n\nThe Depression did not put an end to Spivey's musical career. She found a new outlet for her talent in 1929, when the film director King Vidor cast her to play Missy Rose in his first sound film, \"Hallelujah!\". Through the 1930s and 1940s Spivey continued to work in musical films and stage shows, including the hit musical \"Hellzapoppin\" (1938), often with her husband, the vaudeville dancer Billy Adams.\n\nIn 1951 Spivey retired from show business to play the pipe organ and lead a church choir, but she returned to secular music in 1961, when she was reunited with an old singing partner, Lonnie Johnson, to appear on four tracks on his Prestige Bluesville album \"Idle Hours\". The folk music revival of the 1960s gave her further opportunities to make a comeback. She recorded again for Prestige Bluesville, sharing an album, \"Songs We Taught Your Mother\", with fellow veterans Alberta Hunter and Lucille Hegamin, and began making personal appearances at festivals and clubs, including the 1963 European tour of the American Folk Blues Festival.\n\nIn 1961 Spivey and the jazz and blues historian Len Kunstadt launched Spivey Records, a low-budget label dedicated to blues, jazz, and related music, prolifically recording established artists, including Sippie Wallace, Lucille Hegamin, Otis Rush, Otis Spann, Willie Dixon, Roosevelt Sykes, Big Joe Turner, Buddy Tate, and Hannah Sylvester, and also newer artists, including Luther Johnson, Brenda Bell, Washboard Doc, Bill Dicey, Robert Ross, Sugar Blue, Paul Oscher, Danny Russo, and Larry Johnson.\n\nIn March 1962 Spivey and Big Joe Williams recorded for Spivey Records, with harmonica accompaniment and backup vocals by Bob Dylan. The recordings were released on \"Three Kings and the Queen\" (Spivey LP 1004) and \"Kings and the Queen Volume Two\" (Spivey LP 1014). (Dylan was listed under his own name on the record covers.) In 1964 Spivey made her only recording with an all-white band, the Connecticut-based Easy Riders Jazz Band, led by the trombonist Big Bill Bissonnette. It was released first on an LP and later re-released on compact disc.\n\nIn Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, she appeared on French television, BBC-TV and Granada TV, but Americans may not have seen these screen appearances until their arrival on YouTube.\n\nSpivey married four times; her husbands included Ruben Floyd and Billy Adams.\n\nSpivey died in New York on October 3, 1976, at the age of 69, from an internal hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2275766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275766", "title": "LeBreton Flats", "text": "LeBreton Flats\n\nLeBreton Flats (also spelled Lebreton Flats) () is a neighbourhood in Somerset Ward in central Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It lies to the west of Centretown neighbourhood, and to the north of Centretown West. The Ottawa River forms the western and northern limit, with the western side being a wider area of the river known as Nepean Bay.\n\nOriginally a residential area, much of the northern portion of the Flats is now occupied by the Canadian War Museum and the National Holocaust Monument. Pimisi station, a station on Ottawa's LRT system, is also in LeBreton Flats. About half of the total area, on the south side of the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway, is undergoing redevelopment. The population was 620 (2016 Census), up from 373 (2011 Census), and 57 in 2006 and 50 in 2001.\n\nLeBreton Flats was named after Lieutenant John LeBreton (1779-1848), one of Nepean Township's first settlers (c. 1819) and a hero of the War of 1812, as an officer in the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and between April and October 1812 he acted as adjutant to the Voltigeurs Canadiens. LeBreton purchased the area in 1820, a purchase which has been described as solely for the purpose of capitalizing on the construction of the planned Rideau Canal.\n\nThe account, according to his detractors, goes as follows. In 1820, LeBreton lived at the community of Britannia, west of Ottawa and overheard Lord Dalhousie explain that the intended plan for the Rideau Canal was from Dow's Lake to the Chaudière Falls, directly crossing the flats. LeBreton bought the land for £499, before Lord Dalhousie had a chance to purchase the territory. LeBreton then offered to sell the land to Dalhousie for £3000. Dalhousie recognized LeBreton's land speculation and was so infuriated he decided to move the canal to Entrance Bay, the current location where the canal enters into the Ottawa River. This significantly raised the cost of the canal, as it was a longer route and additional locks were now required. At the same time, Dalhousie purchased neighbouring Barracks Hill as part of the agreement, which would become Parliament Hill.\n\nFor his part, LeBreton vigorously maintained that he had purchased the land fairly at a public auction and that he had been grievously wronged by Dalhousie and those in the community who took the Governor General's side. LeBreton claimed he was one of the few to grasp the commercial value of the flats and that he had begun to make offers to acquire land there as early as 1818, well before the canal was approved or any route revealed. LeBreton presented Dalhousie with a lengthy written defence against the allegations. These arguments Dalhousie somewhat peremptorily dismissed, entrenching the notion of LeBreton as a swindler in local legend.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, LeBreton Flats developed into a mixed community to serve the lumber mills on the nearby Chaudière and Victoria islands. A rail line came in with a station and yards, and industries developed in turn. There was also housing for both the workers and owners, as well as hotels and taverns.\n\nThe area was ravaged by the Great Fire of 1900, which had started across the river in Hull (now Gatineau, Quebec), but crossed over by way of the great stacks of piled lumber on the islands. The fire destroyed the neighbourhood, leaving many homeless. The area was rebuilt, but the lumber barons relocated their dwellings up into the city proper above the escarpment, leaving the workers as the remaining Flats' residents.\n\nIn the 1960s, expropriation occurred in order to make room for redevelopment, including offices for the Government of Canada. Ottawa Valley artist Ralph Wallace Burton documented the neighbourhood in his Lebreton Flats series of oil sketches (now on display in Ottawa City Hall), \"working just ahead of the demolition crews\".\n\nAs a result of disputes over the use of the land and soil contamination from the previous industrial uses, the land remained vacant for over forty years. It was used in the winter for piling snow that had been removed from Ottawa streets, with the pile often remaining well into the late spring. As a result of the runoff from this snowpile, the land became more contaminated.\n\nBecause of this, it was found that almost all of the area's topsoil would have to be removed in order for redevelopment to proceed, but the ownership had to be consolidated, since the Government of Canada, the former Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton government, and the City of Ottawa were all landowners. This situation was remedied with a federal agency called the National Capital Commission (NCC) acquiring all title to the land.\n\nIn May 2005, the new home for the Canadian War Museum was opened on LeBreton Flats as the first component of redevelopment. There are plans to use the remainder of the site for housing, commercial space, offices and parkland.\n\nThe southern part of LeBreton Flats between Albert Street and Nanny Goat Hill escaped the expropriation of the 1960s. In this area, brick houses and townhouses built immediately following the 1900 fire still exist alongside row housing built in the 1970s. The portion of Lorne Avenue which lies below Nanny Goat Hill is an example of the housing which filled LeBreton prior to the 1960s and is a Heritage District designated by the City of Ottawa.\n\nThe western portion of the Transitway ran through LeBreton Flats, which served Lebreton Station. The Transitway was replaced by the Confederation Line light rail, which opened on September 14, 2019.\n\nAs of the Canada 2006 Census, 57 people were living in LeBreton Flats. The portion of LeBreton Flats that had been expropriated and left vacant in the 1960s welcomed its first residents in 2008, as the first condominium building constructed in the first phase of the redevelopment neared completion.\n\nIn 2015, the NCC put out a request for submissions to redevelop the south and south-western sections of LeBreton Flats, north of Albert Street, in size. Four groups submitted proposals:\n\n\nIn April 2016, the NCC selected the RendezVous LeBreton proposal, which included 4,000 housing units, park space, a recreation facility with services for the disabled, a library (just off the defined redevelopment lands) and a new arena for the Ottawa Senators team in the NHL. A completion date was not announced.\n\nIn January 2018, the NCC reached an agreement with RendezVous to redevelop LeBreton Flats in a two-phase operation. However, before construction could begin a conflict between the development consortium parties led to that project being cancelled by the National Capital Commission, who then conducted a new series of public consultations which resulted in a new Preliminary Master Concept Plan being approved in January 2020. The plan divided the undeveloped land into four sectors, with the intention of determining, in the first half of 2020, the order in which the various parcels of land will be developed, and parks and public spaces created.\n\nPooley's Bridge (), Ottawa's oldest bridge, is a stone arch bicycle/pedestrian bridge located in LeBreton Flats east of the Canadian War Museum and south of the Portage Bridge. The three span closed spandrel stone arch structure, built in 1873, was designated as a heritage structure by the City of Ottawa in 1994. It is located beside the Fleet Street Pumping Station (Ottawa's original water works) at the end of Fleet Street.\n\nThe bridge is located at 9 Fleet Street, at the southwest edge of Bronson Park. It is very near and southeast of LeBreton Flats' first new condo unit. It is south (but beyond some grassy area) of where Wellington Street meets the Portage Bridge. The city describes it as \"over the channel tailrace of the Fleet Street\nPumping Station\". The City waterworks building, including the pumping station and the aqueduct were designated as heritage in 1982 under the Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act.\n\nPooley's Bridge is one of six stone arch bridges in the Lebreton Flats, all built circa 1873. All are Heritage Bridges and are designated to serve as pedestrian/bicycle facilities only. The five other bridges are all single span stone arch bridges over the aqueduct, west of Pooley's Bridge. They are: Canada Central Railway Bridge, Broad Street Bridge, Lloyd Street Bridge, Grand Trunk Railway Bridge and Lett Street Bridge. The first bridge is owned by the National Capital Commission; the second, third and fifth by the City of Ottawa; and the fourth bridge is under the Region's ownership. The third, fourth and fifth bridges are connected.\n\nThe condition of Pooley's Bridge has been of concern for a number of years. It was necessary to undertake the controlled removal operations on the bridge in 1994, to ensure public safety. Due to anticipated failures, the City of Ottawa filed an Application to Alter and make repairs to five other stone arch bridges in the area in 1999. The repairs required at the five stone arch bridges were relatively minor, but expensive.\n\nPooley's Bridge in Bytown, an earlier bridge, was built in 1836 by Lieutenant Henry Pooley and assigned by Colonel John By who gave it the name after seeing the unpeeled log structure. The bridge was on the road from Wellington and Bank en route to the Union Bridge (see Chaudière Bridge). It was between Upper Town and LeBreton Flats, and appeared in a Chesterton painting.\n\nDownstream of Pooley's Bridge and the Pumphouse lies the Tailrace. The Ottawa River Runners made the Tailrace into a Class 2 whitewater course with natural and artificial obstacles for competitions and practice.\n\nThe Ottawa Bluesfest music festival takes place at Lebreton Flats annually. Performances by many famous and local musicians occur during this 12-day music festival in the month of July.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2275767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275767", "title": "Triumph TR5", "text": "Triumph TR5\n\nThe Triumph TR5 is a sports car built by the Triumph Motor Company in Coventry, England, between August 1967 and September 1968.\n\nVisually similar to the TR4 (also styled by Michelotti), the TR5 roadster sported Triumph's much more powerful 2.5-litre straight-6, fitted with Lucas mechanical fuel-injection and producing . Price pressures and tighter emissions standards in the U.S. resulted in a much less powerful carburetted version, the TR250, being sold on the North American market.\n\nAt the time, fuel injection was uncommon in road cars. Triumph claimed in their sales brochure that it was the \"First British production sports car with petrol injection\".\n\nStandard equipment included front disc brakes, independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering and a four speed gearbox. Optional extras included overdrive and wire wheels. In 1968 the basic price of the TR5 in the UK was £1,260 including taxes, with wire wheels being another £38, overdrive £60 and a tonneau cover another £13.\n\nThe TR5 was available with the \"Surrey Top\" hard top, a weather protection system with rigid rear section including the rear window and removable fabric section over the driver and passenger's heads.\n\nA curious feature of the TR5/Lucas petrol injection system was the very frequent occurrence of an intermittent power failure when the fuel tank was no more than a quarter full. In order to provide fresh fuel at the distributor, free from overheating/soak, unused fuel was returned to the tank where it entered very close to the high pressure fuel pump. When the fuel level fell below critical (about 3 gallons), sloshing would cause the pump to pick up a slightly aerated mixture which was sent to the fuel distributor. Unused fuel (still aerated) then passed back to the tank and was discharged close to the pump, a proportion of it being picked up and recycled to the distributor. As this cycle was repeated, gradually the volume of air in the pumped fuel reached a level where it began to affect the running of the engine. Adding as little as one gallon to the tank seemed to cure the problem. The similarly engineered contemporary saloon overcame this problem with a petrol tank specially designed for the fuel injected model. This incorporated an anti-slosh cup to ensure that the fuel outlet remained covered with fuel when the tank level was low.\n\n\"Taken from the UK sales brochure.\"\n\nThe fuel-injected engine could propel the TR5 from 0– in 6.5 seconds, reaching a top speed of . Road tests at the time reported slightly different performance figures:\n\nThe TR5 engine was carried forward to the TR6.\n\nThe TR5 was produced in small numbers when compared with the later TR6, with just 2,947 units produced; the first car was assembled on 29 August 1967 and the last on 19 September 1968. Of these, 1,161 were destined for the UK market, the remainder were left hand drive and were exported to France, Belgium and Germany amongst other countries. In the first quarter of 2011 there were approximately 410 licensed and 74 SORN TR5s registered with the DVLA.\n\nThe Triumph TR250 was built during the same period for the North American market. Price pressures and tighter emission regulations resulted in twin Zenith-Stromberg carburettors being fitted instead of the TR5's Lucas fuel injection system. Otherwise it is nearly identical.\n\nThe TR250's engine delivered 111 bhp (81 kW), 39 bhp less than the TR5; acceleration took 10.6 seconds. The TR250 was also available with the Surrey Top system.\n\nIn 1968, the TR250 sold in North America for approximately $3,395, with wire wheels a $118 option, overdrive $175, and air conditioning $395.\n\nEngine:\n\nTurning circle: 10.1 m (33 ft)\n\nCapacities:\nPerformance:\n\nA total of 8,484 TR250s were built for the U.S market. Approximately 600 remain worldwide today, and many can now be found outside the United States, primarily in Europe.\n"}

Although opposed by important figures such as Luftwaffe fighter force leader Adolf Galland, the project went ahead owing to the backing of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Most of the designs of the Emergency Fighter Program never proceeded past the project stage.\n\n1944 opened with massive bombing raids by the US Army Air Force and RAF Bomber Command on a scale not seen before. With a shift of emphasis from targeting strategic targets to the destruction of the \"Luftwaffe\", during the Big Week in late February 1944 the \"Luftwaffe\" fighter force was broken. Attempts to address this failed, and by the summer, Allied planes were roaming at will over most of Germany.\n\nJet fighters like the Messerschmitt Me 262, at that time about to enter service, had a clear performance advantage over the Allied aircraft but were expensive and difficult to keep operational. This led to the idea of a much less expensive design that could be easily built and so inexpensive that any extensive problems would be addressed by simply disposing of the aircraft. This became the genesis of the Emergency Fighter Program as part of shifting production to defensive interceptor/fighters. A number of new aircraft design competition programmes were launched to provide new jet fighters.\n\nProduction of the Messerschmitt Me 262A fighter versions continued, as well as the development of advanced piston-engined fighters such as the Dornier Do 335 as per Hitler's personal request on May 23, 1944, before the July 3 announcement of the program. Bomber designs powered by piston engines were severely curtailed or outright cancelled, with only jet bombers allowed to continue in production, such as the Arado Ar 234. New jet bombers such as the Junkers Ju 287 and Heinkel He 343 were worked on fitfully as low priority projects in the last months of the war.\n\nTowards the end of the war in the design of the planes little thought was given to the safety or comfort of the pilots who were mostly Hitler Youth motivated by fanaticism. Some of the fighters, such as the Heinkel P.1077 \"Julia\", the Blohm & Voss BV 40 and the Arado E.381 \"Kleinstjäger\" – \"smallest fighter\" were designed with the pilot flying the aircraft in a prone position. Powered by rockets, certain designs were a blend of \"aircraft and projectile\" in the words of Nazi propaganda, with a vertical takeoff like a missile launch system attempted for the first time in a manned aircraft, such as the Bachem Ba 349 \"Natter\" —in which the test-pilot died in the first flight. The \"Natter\" and \"Julia\" designs were expected to climb to their ceiling at vertical or near vertical angles, while the Arado design was a parasite aircraft that needed to be carried by a \"mother\" plane, with the unpowered BV 40 needing an aerotow into action.\n\nThese small interceptors had fuel for only a few minutes for combat action and landing was fraught with hazards, for after spending the rocket fuel the center of gravity would shift substantially making the aircraft difficult to handle at best and uncontrollable at worst. In the \"Natter\" or in the \"Fliegende Panzerfaust\" the pilot had to bail out at the end of a mission while the rear fuselage containing the rocket motor descended under its own parachute. Other designs, such as the Focke-Wulf Volksjäger 2, sought to overcome this problem by means of a very short fuselage design. Instead of having a wheeled undercarriage most rocket-powered planes that were able to land had only a fixed skid.\n\nSuch simplified and dangerous planes were the products of the last phase of the Third Reich, when the lack of materials and the dire need for a strong defense against the Allied bombing raids required such craft to be built quickly in underground factories. During this period the Nazi authorities also considered the use of \"selbstopfer\" (suicide) planes such as the \"Reichenberg\" (a manned version of the V-1 flying bomb), and in one case of actual use, a \"special detachment\" unit dedicated to desperate aerial ramming tactics, known as \"Sonderkommando Elbe\".\n\nIn August 1944, a requirement led to the \"Volksjäger\" (\"Peoples' Fighter\") aircraft design competition, to create a lightweight high-speed fighter/interceptor using a single BMW 003 turbojet engine as specified, intended for rapid mass-production while using minimal resources. The \"Volksjäger\" was intended to be disposable, with damaged aircraft being discarded rather than repaired, while it was to be flown by pilots hastily trained on gliders.\n\nAfter a hurried design competition involving almost all of Germany's aircraft companies, including Zeppelin with its \"Fliegende Panzerfaust\", Heinkel's He 162 proposal was selected as the winning \"Volksjäger\" airframe design. The first prototype of the He 162 \"Spatz\" (Sparrow), flew in December 1944. Other designs submitted to the Peoples' Fighter Programme, such as the Blohm & Voss P 211, were potentially superior, but never proceeded past the project stage.\n\nIn November 1944, a programme for an even simpler fighter, the so-called \"Miniaturjägerprogramm\" (\"Miniature Fighter Program\") was launched. The aim was to develop and mass-produce a very small interceptor using the absolute minimum of strategic materials. Linked to Nazi propaganda, stress was laid on producing the fighter planes cheaply and in large numbers so as to overwhelm the Allied bomber formations that flew daily over Germany. The \"Miniaturjäger\" would be powered by one Argus As 014 pulsejet engine per unit, as this engine required far fewer construction man-hours, than the 375 man-hours needed to build a Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet. The various German aircraft designers showed less interest in this new enterprise than in the Peoples' Fighter Project for the imminent He 162 program would swallow up most of what was left of the country's available — and rapidly diminishing — production capacity. Furthermore, it was already well known by the time the \"Miniaturjäger\" competition was announced that, as they didn't produce enough power at low speeds for takeoff, the Argus pulsejets were unsuitable for manned aircraft that would have to takeoff unassisted. Since additional launch schemes would have to be added to the project, such as towplanes, catapults or rocket boosters, the goal of the program would be defeated as complexity and expense would be far higher. Thus the \"Miniaturjäger\" project never saw mass-production, being abandoned by December 1944.\n\nEven so, aircraft manufacturers Heinkel, Blohm & Voss and Junkers came up with light fighter designs using a strict minimum of materials before that date. The resulting planes were small, spartan creations, with no radio and almost no electrical equipment, Heinkel would use a He 162 air frame powered by a pulse jet, Blohm & Voss designed the BV P 213 and Junkers would submit the Ju EF 126 \"Elli\" project. The only Miniature Fighter aircraft to get beyond blueprint status was the Junkers EF 126. Although unbuilt during the war, five prototypes were built in the Dessau Junkers plant in the area occupied by the Soviet Union. One of the prototypes was destroyed during unpowered testing in 1946, killing the pilot.\n\nAt the beginning of 1945 a further programme was launched by the OKL in order to replace the He 162 \"Volksjäger\". The new aircraft was intended to have superior performance in order to deal with future high altitude threats such as the B-29 Superfortress, which eventually never saw action in Europe owing to the end of the war. To meet this requirement, power was to be a single Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet, of which only 19 examples were ever produced, and all allocated for development testing. The designs of the Messerschmitt P.1110, Heinkel P.1078, Focke-Wulf Ta 183, Blohm & Voss P 212 as well as the official winner of the competition, the Junkers EF 128, were submitted by February 1945.\n\nOnly the Messerschmitt prototype of this more advanced fighter had been started by the end of the war. The first prototype of the Messerschmitt P.1101 was 80% complete when captured at the end of the war, following which it was taken to America, with some of its design ideas used as the basis of the solely American-built Bell X-5 variable geometry research aircraft.\n\n\n\n"}

Discussing Theodor Adorno, Max defines surrealist music as that which \"juxtaposes its historically devalued fragments in a montage-like manner which enables them to yield up new meanings within a new aesthetic unity,\" though Lloyd Whitesell says this is Paddison's gloss of the term . Anne cites automatism, including improvisation, and collage as the primary techniques of musical surrealism. According to Whitesell, Paddison quotes Adorno's 1930 essay \"Reaktion und Fortschritt\" as saying \"Insofar as surrealist composing makes use of devalued means, it uses these \"as\" devalued means, and wins its form from the 'scandal' produced when the dead suddenly spring up among the living\" .\n\nIn the 1920s several composers were influenced by surrealism, or by individuals in the surrealist movement. The two composers most associated with surrealism during this period were Erik Satie , who wrote the score for the ballet \"Parade\", causing Guillaume Apollinaire to coin the term \"surrealism\" , and George Antheil who wrote that, \"The Surrealist movement had, from the very beginning, been my friend. In one of its manifestos it had been declared that all music was unbearable—excepting, possibly, mine—a beautiful and appreciated condescension\" .\n\nAdorno cites as the most consequent surrealist compositions those works by Kurt Weill, such as \"The Threepenny Opera\" and \"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\", along with works by others drawn from the middle-period music of Igor Stravinsky—most particularly that of \"L'Histoire du soldat\"—and defines this surrealism as a hybrid form between the \"modern\" music of Arnold Schoenberg and his school, and the \"objectivist\" neoclassicism/folklorism of the later Stravinsky. This surrealism, like objectivism, recognizes alienation but is more socially alert. It thereby denies itself the positivist notions of objectivism, which are recognised as illusion. Its content deals instead with \"permitting social flaws to manifest themselves by means of flawed invoice, which defines itself as illusory with no attempts at camouflage through attempts at an aesthetic totality\" , thereby destroying aesthetic formal immanence and transcending into the literary realm. This surrealism is further differentiated from a fourth type of music, the so-called Gebrauchsmusik of Paul Hindemith and Hanns Eisler, which attempts to break through alienation from within itself, even at the expense of its immanent form .\n\nThe early works of musique concrète by Pierre Schaeffer have a surrealist character owing to the unexpected juxtaposition of sound objects, such as the sounds of Balinese priests chanting, a barge on the River Seine, and rattling saucepans in \"Etude aux casseroles\" (1948). The composer Olivier Messiaen referred to the \"surrealist anxiety\" of Schaeffer's early work in contrast to the \"asceticism\" of the later \"Etude aux allures\" of 1958 . After the first concert of musique concrète (\"Concert de bruits\", October 5, 1948) Schaeffer received a letter from one member of the audience (identified only as G. M.) describing it as \"the music heard, by themselves alone, by Poe and Lautréamont, and Raymond Roussel. The concert of noises represents not only the first concert of surrealist music, but also contains, in my view, a musical revolution\" . Schaeffer himself argued that musique concrète, in its initial phase, tended either towards atonality or surrealism, or both, rather than, as it subsequently became, the starting point of a more general musical procedure .\n\n\n"}

The original main street going into Bentong town has been modified to a dual carriageway and now Bentong Town has been declared as the first \"Fresh Air Lung Washing\" destination in the country.\n\nAccording to an old story, Bentong was previously known as Carlo Sas. It was changed from Papi to Bentong before World War I.\nIn earlier times, the center of Bentong was around the market area, at the meeting point of the Chongki rivers Repas and Perting.\n\nThe most important transportation way at that time was the rivers by using \"perahu\" (small boats). The jetty was situated in front of current rest house (near current Bentong Police Station).\n\nBentong became a focal point when tin ore was discovered in the two main rivers, Repas and Perting. Tin developers constructed ‘ban’ to extract more ore, hence more profits. The practice became a talking matter to the people outside Bentong, who referred to it as the story of ‘ban untung’ (the Profitable Ban). ‘Ban Untung’ became more well-known than Kapong that later people began to call it Ban Untung. From the name ‘Ban Untung’ was what the name for the district of Bentong derived from.\n\nFrom other story, according to Pak Zek (Budayawan Dato’ Haji Zakaria bin Hitam), the name Bentong originated from ‘Bapong’ (meaning float). Bentong was once used as a fort by Dato’ Bahaman. The British army sent over the Gurkhas mercenary to defeat Dato’ Bahaman to take over the area. However, a number of the Gurkhas were killed after they were ambushed by Dato’ Bahaman’s men. Their bodies were thrown into the river and floated in the water. Following the incident, the site was known as Bapong, and later known as Bentong. The exact date of the name change was on 31 August 1957.\n\n\nBentong average temperature is on while rainfall every month.\n"}

Commonly nicknamed \"White Rose\", he was the last Yorkist claimant to actively and openly seek the crown of England. He lived in exile after many of his relatives were executed, becoming allied with Louis XII of France in the War of the League of Cambrai. Louis saw him as a more favourable ally and prospect for an English king than Henry VIII.\n\nDuring 1514, the stage was set for a Yorkist reclaiming of England under Richard. He was in Brittany with 12,000 mercenaries set for the invasion, leading his army to St. Malo; however, France and England made peace just as they were about to embark and it was thus called off. Later, with Francis I as king, Richard struck up an alliance in 1523 and planned a Yorkist invasion of England once again. However, this never came to fruition, as Richard died fighting alongside Francis I at the Battle of Pavia two years later.\n\nHe was the seventh and youngest son of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk and his wife Elizabeth of York. His mother was the elder of the two surviving daughters of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville. She was also a younger sister to Edward IV of England and Edmund, Earl of Rutland as well as an older sister to Margaret of York, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence and Richard III of England.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk and Alice Chaucer. Suffolk was an important English soldier and commander in the Hundred Years' War, and later Lord Chamberlain of England. He also appears prominently in William Shakespeare's \"Henry VI, Part 1\" and \"Henry VI, Part 2\".\n\nAlice Chaucer was a daughter of Thomas Chaucer and Maud Burghersh. Thomas was the Speaker of the English House of Commons on three occasions, Chief Butler of England for almost thirty years, attended fifteen parliaments and was Speaker of the House five times, a feat not surpassed until the 18th century.\n\nThomas was a son of Geoffrey Chaucer and his wife Philippa (de) Roet. Geoffrey was an English author, poet, philosopher, bureaucrat (courtier) and diplomat. He is sometimes called the father of English literature. Although he wrote many works, he is best remembered for his unfinished frame narrative \"The Canterbury Tales\". He is also credited by some scholars with being the first author to demonstrate the artistic legitimacy of the vernacular English language, rather than French or Latin.\n\nHis eldest brother John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln (c. 14641487), may have been named heir to the throne by his maternal uncle, Richard III of England, who gave him a pension and the reversion of the estates of Lady Margaret Beaufort. However, on the accession of Henry VII following the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Lincoln took the oath of allegiance instead of claiming the throne for himself.\n\nIn 1487, Lincoln joined the rebellion of Lambert Simnel and was killed at the Battle of Stoke. The second brother, Edmund (c. 14711513), succeeded his father while still in his minority. His estates suffered under the attainder of his brother, and he was compelled to pay large sums to Henry VII for the recovery of part of the forfeited lands, and also to exchange his title of duke for that of earl. In 1501 he sought out Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, in Tyrol and received from him a promise of substantial assistance in case of an attempt on the English crown.\n\nIn consequence of these treasonable proceedings Henry VII seized Edmund's brother William, with four other Yorkist noblemen. Two of them, Sir James Tyrrell and Sir John Wyndham, were executed; William de la Pole was imprisoned; and Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, was outlawed. Then in July 1502 Henry VII concluded a treaty with Maximilian by which the Emperor bound himself not to countenance English rebels. Presently Suffolk fell into the hands of Philip I of Castile, who imprisoned him at Namur and in 1506 surrendered him to Henry VII, on condition that his life was spared. He remained a prisoner until 1513, when he was beheaded by Henry VIII at the time his brother Richard took up arms with the French king.\n\nRichard de la Pole joined Edmund abroad in 1504, and remained at Aix-la-Chapelle as surety for his elder brother's debts. The creditors threatened to surrender him to Henry VII but, more fortunate than his brother, he found a safe refuge at Buda with King Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nHe was excluded from the general pardon proclaimed at the accession of Henry VIII, and when Louis XII of France went to war with the Kingdom of England in 1512, he recognised Edmund's pretensions to the English crown and gave Richard a command in the French army. In 1513, after the execution of Edmund, he assumed the title of Earl of Suffolk. In 1514 he was given 12,000 German mercenaries, ostensibly for the defence of Brittany, but really for an invasion of England. These he led to St. Malo, but the conclusion of peace with England prevented their embarcation. Richard was required to leave France, and he established himself at Metz, in Lorraine, and built a palace at La Haute Pierre, near St. Simphorien.\n\nWhile at Metz, he was visited by Pierre Alamire, the German-Netherlandish composer and music copyist, who was a spy for Henry VIII. However, Richard employed Alamire as a counter-spy against Henry, and Alamire, on being suspected of unreliability by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and Henry VIII, never returned to England.\n\nRichard de la Pole had numerous interviews with King Francis I of France, and in 1523 he was permitted, in concert with John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany, the Scottish regent, to arrange an invasion of England, which was never carried out.\n\nHe was with Francis I at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, where he was killed. In a picture of the battle, preserved at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, his lifeless body is represented in the thick of the combat with the inscription \"Le Duc de Susfoc dit Blance Rose\" (The Duke of Suffolk, known as White Rose).\n\nRichard de la Pole was never known to have married, but he is known to have had a daughter by a mistress. It has been suggested that she may have been Marie of Sicily.\n\nMarguerite and her husband had three sons and five daughters:\n\nMarguerite de la Pole's will was dated 1599.\n\n\n"}

Romero. It stars Lane Carroll, Will MacMillan, and Harold Wayne Jones as residents of a small American town that accidentally becomes afflicted by a military biological weapon. Filmed in Pennsylvania, \"The Crazies\" was a box office failure upon release, but has since become a cult film. A remake of the film was released in 2010.\n\nIn Evans City, Pennsylvania, a man kills his wife and burns down his farmhouse. Firefighters David, a Green Beret, and Clank, an infantryman, both having served in the Vietnam War, are called to the scene. The man who burned down his home is handcuffed in the back of a police car, ranting hysterically. Meanwhile, David's pregnant girlfriend, a nurse named Judy, is called to the office of Dr. Brookmyre, where the two children of the arsonist are being treated for burns.\n\nHeavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks arrive in the town, and are being led by Major Ryder, who takes over Dr. Brookmyre's office. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying a bioweapon had crash-landed near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \"Trixie\" which is highly contagious and causes victims to either die or become hysterical and homicidally insane. \n\nIn Washington D.C., government officials order Colonel Peckem to go to Evans City to help contain the virus, while scientist Dr. Watts is brought in to develop a cure. Martial law is declared in Evans City and a quarantine is placed on the town. Army soldiers forcibly move the townspeople into a high school, rousting many from their homes, and shoot anyone attempting to escape. Bombers armed with nuclear weapons are dispatched to destroy the town if necessary. \n\nIn one house, a soldier encounters an elderly woman who stabs him with her knitting needle. A group of soldiers are killed by a mob armed with guns and dynamite, after which an infected woman happily sweeps the blood-soaked grass. A local priest, upset at the soldiers rousting his flock, douses himself with gasoline and sets himself on fire.\n\nDavid, Judy, Clank, teenager Kathy Fulton, her father Artie, and a sick man named Frank are confined to a large van by the soldiers. The van is attacked by infected people, and the soldiers try to fight them off. Frank wanders off, muttering, and is captured by the soldiers. Clank and David commandeer the van, and the five of them try to find a way to escape the town, spending the night hiding in a building of a country club.\n\nThe next day, the group attempts to escape by traveling through the nearby woods, fighting off soldiers both on the ground and in an overhead helicopter. Later that day, they come across a house occupied by a handful of soldiers and David and Clank kill the sentries outside the house and hold three of the soldiers inside the house at gunpoint. One of the soldiers discloses what he knows about the virus to David, but when one of the soldiers reaches for his gun, Clank opens fire and kills the soldiers. David confides in Judy what he knows about the virus and tells her that Kathy, Artie, and probably Clank are infected.\n\nGoing insane from the effects of virus, Artie attempts to rape Kathy. Discovering the pair, Clank beats Artie, who then apparently hangs himself and the next morning, a shaken Kathy wanders outside and is killed by soldiers. Believing himself to be infected, Clank kills several soldiers before being shot in the head, allowing David and Judy to escape. \n\nThat evening, Judy, now visibly infected, is killed by armed civilians. One of the civilians recognizes David and identifies himself as a fellow firefighter, also uninfected and trying to escape. Angry and frightened, David surrenders to the military. After being taken into custody, David eventually realizes that he is immune to the virus, but he keeps the knowledge to himself.\n\nDuring all of this, the soldiers isolate Dr. Watts in the high school where the infected are being corralled, allowing him to use the simple chemistry lab inside. Watts insists that he might find a cure in a proper laboratory but is not granted access to one, and when Watts develops and goes to share a possible cure he is mistaken for one of the infected and forced into quarantine by the soldiers. The test tubes containing the possible vaccine are shattered after the doctor is pushed down a flight of stairs by a stampede of infected persons and is killed... along with the knowledge of a possible cure.\n\nIn the final scenes, a distraught Colonel Peckem is ordered to relocate to Louisville, where symptoms of the virus have been reported. After passing a medical test, he boards a helicopter and departs.\n\n\nAccording to Romero on the DVD commentary track, this project began life with Paul McCollough, who authored a screenplay entitled \"The Mad People\". The script dealt with a military bioweapon that was accidentally released into a small town, with the military subsequently trying to cover up the incident and the townspeople revolting. Romero revealed that the military subplot was only featured in the first act of the script, and the rest of the film focused on the survivors and their attempts to cope with what was happening. The director called McCollough's script \"very existential and heady\".\n\nThe screenplay was read by Lee Hessel, a producer who owned Cambist Films and with whom Romero had previously worked on \"There's Always Vanilla\". Hessel expressed interest in it and offered to finance it as Romero's next film, but only if the director would be willing to rewrite McCollough's screenplay to focus on what Hessel considered the most interesting ingredient of the story, namely the military takeover of the town, which occurred in the first 10 to 20 pages. Romero agreed and rewrote the script, and he was given a budget of approximately $270,000.\n\nThe film was shot in and around Evans City and Zelienople, both small towns in Pennsylvania about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. Romero has spoken of how the majority of people in the towns were very cooperative and happy to help with the production.\n\nOn February 23, 2010, the film was released on Blu-ray by Blue Underground, the same company who first issued a DVD release on April 29, 2003. It was later re-released with a new 4K restoration by Arrow Video as part of a boxset entitled George A. Romero: Between Night and Dawn. It was later released separately on March 13, 2018.\n\nThe film did not have a wide release, instead playing in a limited number of theaters before opening in a different market. Romero later claimed he felt that the major reason \"The Crazies\" failed at the box office was due to poor distribution. He stated that Hessel made a true attempt to adequately market the film, including releasing it under a variety of titles in different parts of the country, but that it never managed to catch the public's eye.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Crazies\" holds an approval rating of 65% with an average rating of 5.44/10, based on 23 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Crazies\" isn't top-shelf Romero, but its blend of genre thrills and social subtext should still be enough to satisfy discerning horror fans.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 6 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n\n"}

She is the former wife of the 3rd Duke of Fife and the widow of General Sir Richard Worsley.\n\nLady Worsley was born \"Miss\" Caroline Dewar at Bardowie Castle at Milngavie, a suburb in Glasgow, Scotland, to \"The Honourable\" Henry Evelyn Alexander Dewar, a younger son of the 1st Baron Forteviot. Her mother was the former Cynthia Monica Starkie. She had a younger brother, John James Evelyn.\n\nHer father's half-brother was John Dewar, 2nd Baron Forteviot. He was 49 and childless, and even at her birth it seemed likely that Caroline's father would become the 3rd Baron. This expectation was met when Lord Forteviot died childless on 24 October 1947. When her father succeeded as 3rd Baron Forteviot, Miss Dewar became \"The Honourable Caroline Dewar\".\n\nMiss Dewar became engaged to the then-Lord Carnegie in May 1956. Lord Carnegie was the son of the 11th Earl of Southesk (1893–1992), and Princess Maud of Fife (1893–1945), and heir-apparent to Lord Southesk's Earldom. Lord Carnegie's maternal aunt, Princess Arthur of Connaught, was the Duchess of Fife in her own right, and Lord Carnegie was also the heir-presumptive to that Dukedom, as Princess Arthur's only child was no longer living. Through his mother, Princess Maud, Lord Carnegie was a great-grandson of King Edward VII.\n\nMiss Dewar and Lord Carnegie were married on 11 September 1956 at Perth in Perthshire. She thus became \"Lady Carnegie\". They had three children.\n\n\nLord Carnegie's aunt, Princess Arthur of Connaught, died on 26 February 1959. At that point, he became the 3rd Duke of Fife and Lady Carnegie became \"Her Grace The Duchess of Fife\". However, the Duchess was not to have that position forever. In December 1966, the Duke and Duchess of Fife were divorced. On account of this, the Duchess lost the style of \"Her Grace\" and became known as \"Caroline, Duchess of Fife\".\n\nOn 7 November 1980, she remarried, at the age of 46, to General Sir Richard Worsley at London, England.

It is the flagship law journal of the University of Michigan Law School and one of the top law journals in the United States.\n\nThe \"Michigan Law Review\" was established in 1902, after Gustavus Ohlinger, a student in the Law Department (now the Law School) of the University of Michigan, approached the dean with a proposal for a law journal. The \"Michigan Law Review\" was originally intended as a forum in which the faculty of the Law Department could publish its legal scholarship. The faculty resolution creating the \"Michigan Law Review\" required every faculty member to submit two articles per year to the new journal.\n\nFrom its inception until 1940, the \"Michigan Law Review\"'s student members worked under the direction of faculty members who served as editor-in-chief. The first of these was Floyd Mechem, the last Paul Kauper. In 1940, the first student editor-in-chief was selected. During the years that followed, student editors were given increasing responsibility and autonomy; today, the \"Michigan Law Review\" is run with no faculty supervision. The current editor-in-chief is Sarah McDonald. Day-to-day production operations are overseen by the current managing editor, Gillian McGann. Seven of each volume's eight issues ordinarily are composed of two major parts: \"Articles\" by legal scholars and practitioners and \"Notes\" written by the student editors. One issue in each volume is devoted to book reviews. Occasionally special issues are devoted to symposia or colloquia.\n\nIn 2016, PrawfsBlawg ranked the \"Michigan Law Review\" as the 6th best law journal by weighing its Google Scholar Metrics law journal ranking, US News Peer Reputation Ranking, US News Overall Ranking, and the W&L Combined Ranking. Based on data from 2009 through 2016, Washington and Lee University School of Law ranked the \"Michigan Law Review\" as the 7th best law journal. According to Google Scholar Metrics, the \"Michigan Law Review\" was the 7th best law journal in 2015 and the 6th best law journal in 2014.\n\nAccording to Washington and Lee University School of Law's Law Library, the \"Michigan Law Review\" is the 7th most cited law journal in academic works, being cited in journals 3888 times between 2009 and 2016, and the 6th most cited law journal by courts, being cited in 128 cases between 2009 and 2016.

When he was barred from taking office, he turned to journalism and became a well known public figure in Bulgaria. Dora attended high school in Varna, and then pursued a degree in Natural Sciences at Sofia University (1904). Later, she studied French Philology in Geneva and Grenoble (1905–1906). \nShe taught French in Dobrich (1907). \nFrom 1911 to 1932, she resided abroad in Poland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, The Czech Republic, France, The United Kingdom with her husband Prof. Boyan Penev. \nIn the 1920s and 1930s, she gave numerous lectures on political and cultural issues such as the development of Bulgarian literature and the fate of the Dobruja region.\n\nIn 1925, the Ministry of Education in Bulgaria assigned Dora Gabe to edit the series \"Библиотека за най-малките\" (\"Library for the youngest\"). \nShe also served as the editor of the children's magazine \"Window\" (1939–1941).\n\nDora Gabe was one of the founders of the Bulgarian-Polish Committee (1922) and the Bulgarian PEN Club (1927).

A popular anecdote claims that after the 9 September coup d'état, partisans were sent to live in Gabe's apartment. The poet moved to her sister's unfinished villa where she had to sleep with a coat under the blankets, because there was no heating, and had to turn on the stove to warm her hands in order to be able to write. Later in life, Gabe opens her an apartment as a home to all young poet seeking where they can live and create.\n\nIn 1900 in Shumen, she published one of her first poems called \"Spring\" in the literary journal \"Youth\". Soon after, she published a series of poems in the magazines \"Thought\", \"Democratic Review\" and \"New Society\" in 1905–1906. This marked the start of her literary career.\nIn the 1920s-30s, she published poetry for adults and children, travelogues, stories, essayistic fiction, impressions, theater reviews, articles on issues of foreign and Bulgarian literature, biographical sketches of poets and writers in magazines such as \"Contemporary Thought \" Zlatorog, \"Polish-Bulgarian review\", \"Democratic Review,\" \"Falling Leaves\", \"Dobrudjanski review\", \"Art and Criticism\", \"Slovo\", \"Age\", \"Journal of Women\", \"Free Speech,\" \"Dawn,\" \"Women's Voice\", \"thought\", \"Contemporary\", \"Journal of newspapers\", \"Dnevnik\", \"Fireworks\".

He held this position from 1845 until his death in 1853. His rule was a short period of relative peace and prosperity between the violent reigns of his father and his son.\n\nMasina is the Inner Niger Delta, a large area where the Niger River divides into separate channels that overflow and flood the land annually. Some time between 1810 and 1818 Seku Amadu Lobbo of the Bari family launched a \"jihad\" against the Fulbe chiefs in Masina, tributaries of the pagan Bambara of Segu, whom he accused of idolatry. The goals of the \"jihad\" soon expanded to that of conquest of the Bambara and others in the region. Seku Amadu established a large empire based on Hamdallahi, which he had founded as the capital. The empire stretched from just downstream of Segu almost all the way to Timbuktu.\n\nSeku Amadu Lobbo received support from Tukolor and Fula people who were seeking independence from the Bambara, but met resistance when he imposed a rigorous Islamic theocracy based on the Maliki interpretation of Sharia law. The new theocratic state was ruled by a council of forty elders, who gave directions to provincial governors. Most of the governors were related to Seku Amadu.\n\nSeku Amadu Lobbo died on 19 March 1845 and his eldest son, also Amadu, was elected as \"almami\". Technically, the new \"almami\" did not have to be a member of the Bari family, but only someone who was learned and pious. There were several candidates, including Ba Lobbo, the son of Seku Amadu's oldest brother. Election of Ba Lobbo would have followed the Bari family tradition of succession through a collateral line rather than direct succession. Others such as Alfa Nuhum Tayru and al-Hadjdj Mody Seydu were better qualified, although not related to the former \"almami\". However, the council chose the son as \"almami\", while Ba Lobbo became the main leader of the state's army.\n\nAt the start of his rule, Amadu II (Amadu Seku) had to suppress internal opposition. He also faced revolts by the Saro Bambara and the Tuareg around Timbuktu, who declared independence. Ba Lobbo defeated the Tuareg with a surprise attack near Lake Gossi early in 1846. In 1847 the local Kunta leader, Sidi al-Bekkai, managed to persuade Amadu to withdraw his military garrison from Timbuktu, but had to accept Masina rule. Amadu was also able to suppress the Bambara revolt.\n\nAmadu's rule was a time of relative peace and prosperity compared to those of his father and his son, building on his father's achievement in persuading the formerly nomadic Fula people to settle, and in establishing a strong legal framework for grazing and transhumance rights. However, Amadu found it hard to maintain the level of enthusiasm for strict Islamic rule that his father had achieved.\n\nAhmadu II was killed during a raid on the Bambara. He died in February 1853. His tomb may still be seen in Hamdallahi, along with that of his father, in the ruins of the palace.\n\nAmadu II nominated his son, also Amadu, as his successor. In 1853, Amadu III was elected to the position of \"Almami\" in accordance with his father's wishes. Amadu III was handicapped by dissension over his succession within the Bari family, and was never secure in his authority. Ahmadu III was defeated on 15 May 1862 by the jihadist el Hadj Umar Tall, who occupied Hamdallahi. The Masina Empire had lasted little more than forty years.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case limiting punitive damages under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW, and later discovered that the vehicle had been repainted before he bought it. Defendant BMW of North America revealed that their policy was to sell damaged cars as new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3% of the cost of the car. Dr. Gore sued, and an Alabama jury awarded $4,000 in compensatory damages (lost value of the car) and $4 million in punitive damages, which was later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. The punitive damages resulted not only from Dr. Gore's damages, but from BMW's egregious behavior across a broad spectrum of BMW purchasers over a multi-year period of time in which BMW repaired damaged vehicles and sold them as new to unsuspecting buyers as a matter of routine business operation. The decision of the Alabama Supreme Court was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nWhether excessively high punitive damages violate the Due Process clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, found that the excessively high punitive damages in this case violate the Due Process clause. For punitive damages to stand, the damages must be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State's legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. Punitive damages may not be \"grossly excessive\" – if they are, then they violate substantive due process.\n\nThe Supreme Court applied three factors in making this determination:\n\nUsing these factors, the Court found that BMW's conduct was not particularly reprehensible (no reckless disregard for health or safety, nor even evidence of bad faith). The ratio of actual or potential damages to punitive damages was suspiciously high. Finally, the criminal sanctions available for similar conduct were limited to $2,000, making the $2 million assessment the equivalent of a severe criminal penalty.\n\nThe Court noted, however, that these three factors can be over-ridden if it is \"necessary to deter future conduct\".\n\nDissenting opinions were written by Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, both contending that the Constitution was not implicated here, raising principles of federalism.\n\nOn remand, the Supreme Court of Alabama ordered a new trial unless plaintiff accepted a remittitur of all but $50,000 of the punitive damages awarded. The court reasoned that it may not have given sufficient weight to the degree of reprehensibility of BMW's conduct, and selected the $50,000 as in the range of other Alabama verdicts in cases of repaired cars being sold as new.\n\nIn an academic article, following the arguments raised by the dissenting justices, Patrick Hubbard has questioned the appropriateness of federal courts reading substantive rights into the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution in order to preempt the role of state courts and legislatures. These same people say the Court should not spend its time as a \"super jury\", second-guessing jury verdicts, but rather, \"[T]he court should be more deferential to state courts and legislatures, and more concerned with developing a coherent framework.\"\n\n\n"}

The latter route, having entered the junction from the south, turns east to end at Lifford Bridge, between Lifford and Strabane (the A38 road continues into Strabane).\n\nPreviously, the section of road between the Polestar Roundabout (also known as the Port Roundabout) and the Dry Arch Roundabout (which is now classified as the N56) was a part of the N14.\nBefore this, the N56 stretched out to Stranorlar from Letterkenny.\n\nAt present, the section between where the N14 begins and where it ends in Lifford, has not been upgraded. However, a cross-border project has been in the planning since at least 2006, with of 2+1 road planned between the N13/N14 junction and Strabane. This includes work across the border in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, providing an upgraded route onto the current A5.\n\nThe route is to commence at the N13/N14 junction near Manorcunningham, just south-east of Letterkenny, and proceed southeast, bypassing Lifford to the south and crossing the N15. It will proceed across the River Finn (and international border), to meet the \"Strabane Bypass\" portion of the A5.\n\nThe Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the route was expected to be published in 2006. Following this, oral hearings were expected to be organised by An Bord Pleanála (the Republic of Ireland's planning board) in 2007 as part of the CPO/EIS procedures. It was expected that the design and tender/procurement process would continue into 2008, with construction beginning later that year and ending in 2010.\n\nAs of 2008, on the National Roads Authority website \"road scheme activity\" section, the N14 is stated to be still at \"Preliminary Design\" stage.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2275840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275840", "title": "1990 Conservative Party leadership election", "text": "1990 Conservative Party leadership election\n\nThe 1990 Conservative Party leadership election in the United Kingdom took place on 20 November 1990 following the decision of Michael Heseltine, former Defence and Environment Secretary, to challenge Margaret Thatcher, the incumbent Prime Minister, for leadership of the Conservative Party.\n\nThatcher failed to win outright under the terms of the election in the first ballot, and was persuaded to withdraw from the second round of voting. She announced her resignation on the morning of 22 November 1990, ending more than 15 years as Conservative leader and 11 years as Prime Minister.\n\nDiscontent with Thatcher's leadership of the party had been growing over the latter years of her tenure. There were differences within the Cabinet over Thatcher's perceived intransigence in her approach to the European Economic Community. In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Chancellor Nigel Lawson forced Thatcher to agree to the \"Madrid Conditions\", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM \"when the time was right\". In July 1989, she retaliated by removing Howe from the Foreign Office, while making him Deputy Prime Minister (in theory a promotion but in reality removing him from a key post).\n\nWhereas Thatcher had presided over an economic boom at the time of her third general election victory in 1987, by the autumn of 1989 interest rates had to be raised to 15% to cool inflation, which was now pushing 10%. Rates would remain at that level until October 1990. Lawson, who had clashed with Thatcher over \"shadowing the Deutschmark\" early in 1988, resigned as Chancellor in October 1989, unable to accept Thatcher publicly taking independent advice from the economist Alan Walters. The beneficiary was John Major, little known to the public hitherto, who had briefly been promoted to succeed Howe as Foreign Secretary in July before succeeding Lawson as Chancellor in October, putting him in pole position to succeed Thatcher.\n\nIn December 1989, Thatcher was challenged for the leadership for the first time since her election to that position in 1975, by the little known 69-year-old backbench MP Sir Anthony Meyer. Thatcher faced no serious threat of losing to this stalking horse challenger, but her political credibility was undermined by the fact that 60 members of the parliamentary Conservative party had not supported her, 33 voting for Meyer, 24 spoiling their ballot papers, and three not voting at all. The non-voters were reported by the next day's \"Glasgow Herald\" to include Michael Heseltine, with the same newspaper ominously reporting that Heseltine's supporters predicted that unless the Prime Minister changed \"her style of leadership\", she would \"be on her way out next year\".\n\nThroughout 1990, the popularity both of Thatcher and her Conservative government waned considerably. The introduction of the deeply unpopular Community Charge (which opponents labelled the \"poll tax\") had been greeted with widespread non-payment and even a riot in Trafalgar Square in March 1990. Labour had held a lead in most of the opinion polls since mid-1989, and at the height of the poll tax controversy, at least one opinion poll had shown Labour support above 50%, a lead of more than 20 points over the Conservatives, although the Conservative parliamentary majority still stood at nearly 100 seats.\n\nBy this time European leaders were discussing merging Europe's currencies to form a single currency, a move which Thatcher also did not favour, and in June Major suggested that this should be a \"hard ECU\", competing for use against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and the Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, finally obtained agreement from a reluctant Thatcher that Britain should join the ERM. By late 1990 the economy was in the first stages of recession, leading to inevitable concerns among Conservative MPs that their party might not win the next election, due by summer 1992 at the latest.\n\nIn her Party Conference Speech early in October, Thatcher mocked the Liberal Democrats' new \"bird\" logo in language lifted from the famous Monty Python \"Dead Parrot sketch\". Only days later, the Liberal Democrats took a seat from the Conservatives at the Eastbourne by-election. On 31 October, Thatcher spoke out firmly in the House of Commons against the vision of European integration, including a single currency, espoused by the European Commission under Jacques Delors at the recent Rome Summit, characterising it as the path to a federal Europe, and declared that her response to such a vision would be \"No! No! No!\" This led to the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe on 1 November. However, Howe did not make his resignation speech immediately, because he had temporarily lost his voice.\n\nThe pro-European former Cabinet minister Michael Heseltine had resigned from the Cabinet over the Westland affair in January 1986 and had been conducting himself as a Prime Minister in waiting, critical of Thatcher's leadership, ever since. He now wrote a six-page public letter to his local Association chairman, calling for more regard for the wide range of opinions in the party before leaving for a trip to the Middle East. His Association officers sent him a 97-word reply on 5 November saying that they supported Thatcher's leadership. The party's regional agent had been present at their meeting, although they insisted he had not interfered with their reply. At about the same time, Thatcher's press secretary Bernard Ingham briefed journalists that Heseltine had \"lit the blue touch paper then retired\", although he denied having demanded that Heseltine \"put up or shut up\"; Heseltine was also taunted along similar lines by the pro-Conservative press, including the \"Daily Mail\" and \"The Times\". Thatcher brought the annual leadership election forward by a fortnight.\n\nAt the Lord Mayor's Banquet on 12 November, Thatcher dismissed Howe's resignation by employing a cricketing metaphor:\n\nThe next day, 13 November, Howe made his resignation speech from the backbenches, addressing his dismay at Thatcher's approach and responding to her recent cricketing metaphor by employing one of his own. Explaining how, in his opinion, her approach made it hard for British ministers to negotiate for Britain's interests in Europe, he declared:\n\nHowe's dramatic speech received cheers from the opposition benches and reinforced the change in general perception of Thatcher from the \"Iron Lady\" to a divisive and confrontational figure. The next morning, 14 November, Heseltine announced that he would challenge her for the leadership of the party.\n\nThe rules for Conservative leadership contests had been introduced for the first such election, in 1965, and modified in 1975, the occasion of Thatcher's own victory over the incumbent leader Edward Heath. There would be a series of ballots of Conservative MPs, conducted by the 1922 Committee, with that committee's chairman, Cranley Onslow, as Returning Officer.\n\nTo win in the first round, as Thatcher had done one year before, a candidate needed not just to win an absolute majority, but also to have a lead over the runner-up of 15 per cent of the total electorate (not just those who actually voted, as had been the case until the 1975 review, but including those who abstained or spoiled their ballot papers). As there were 372 Conservative MPs in November 1990, a majority of at least 56 votes was therefore required.\n\nIf no candidate achieved a sufficient majority, nominations would be re-opened, so new candidates could come forward, and a second ballot would take place one week later, at which only an absolute majority would be required. If necessary, the top three candidates from the second round would then go forward to a third and final round held under the alternative vote system.\n\nMany speculated that, if Thatcher did not achieve outright victory in the first round, she would either be forced to step down (opening up the field to her supporters who had previously been prevented from standing by their personal loyalty) or else might suffer further challenges from heavyweight figures. Although Heseltine was a serious leadership contender in his own right, many saw him (correctly, as it turned out) as a \"stalking horse\" like Meyer in 1989, who might weaken Thatcher only to pave the way for victory by a new candidate in a later round.\n\nHeseltine was proposed by Neil Macfarlane (who had been a leading Thatcher backer in the 1975 contest) and Peter Tapsell. His campaign was run by Keith Hampson, Michael Mates and Peter Temple-Morris. He proposed a complete review of the poll tax but rejected Thatcher's proposal of a referendum on British membership of the mooted single European currency. Thatcher gave an interview to \"The Times\" in which she attacked his corporatist views, which made her appear extreme. Heseltine canvassed hard around Parliament whilst Thatcher was away at the Fontainebleau summit.\n\nThe first ballot in the election took place on Tuesday 20 November 1990. Thatcher herself was still in France on the night of the contest and therefore voted by proxy, perhaps anticipating a better result than she actually achieved.\n<section begin=\"First ballot: 20 November 1990\"/>\n<section end=\"First ballot: 20 November 1990\"/>\n\nAlthough Thatcher had obtained a clear majority, she was four votes short of the required 15% margin, so the contest had to move to a second ballot. Thatcher gave a short statement in Paris following the announcement of the result, declaring that she intended to contest the second ballot, and on her return to London the following morning declared \"I fight on; I fight to win\".\n\nAfter the first ballot result the Heseltine team boasted of momentum, which was tactically foolish in the view of his biographer Michael Crick. He argues that they should have encouraged Thatcher to remain in the contest by underplaying Heseltine's support, much as the then challenger Thatcher and her campaign manager Airey Neave had done prior to the first ballot of the 1975 contest.\n\nHurd and Major pledged their support for Thatcher, as did Cecil Parkinson, Kenneth Baker and ex-Cabinet minister Nicholas Ridley. Norman Tebbit, another ex-Cabinet minister, was part of her campaign team, along with John Wakeham. Thatcher's campaign manager, Peter Morrison, advised her to consult Cabinet members one by one on 21 November. Cabinet ministers had decided before consulting Thatcher the line they would each take: though they would support her in the second ballot, they thought that she would lose. Peter Lilley, William Waldegrave, John Gummer and Chris Patten stuck to this line. Kenneth Clarke, the Secretary of State for Education, became the first of her ministers to advise her that she could not win but that he could support her as Prime Minister for another five or ten years. Malcolm Rifkind said she would not win and was unsure whether he could support her in the second ballot. Peter Brooke said he would support Thatcher whatever she chose to do and that she could win \"with all guns blazing\". Michael Howard doubted whether she could win but said he would campaign vigorously for her.\n\nThatcher therefore decided to withdraw her candidacy on the morning of 22 November 1990 (she remained in office as Prime Minister until the contest had been concluded). As a result of this, two further candidates allowed themselves to be nominated: the Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major.\n\nThe Cabinet agreed that if Heseltine became party leader, it would divide the party even further; and that one of its present members should succeed Thatcher. The only Cabinet member to endorse Heseltine for the second ballot was the Welsh Secretary, David Hunt, who had not been party to the agreement as he had been away in Tokyo. Four junior ministers openly backed Heseltine: the Welsh Office ministers Wyn Roberts and Ian Grist, and David Trippier and David Leigh. Heseltine was also endorsed by a number of senior ex-ministers including: Sir Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson, Lord Carrington (who as a peer had no vote), Peter Walker, David Howell, Ian Gilmour, Norman Fowler, Geoffrey Rippon, Jim Prior, Norman St John-Stevas and Paul Channon, but he had less support among younger MPs amongst whom he had done little to canvass support. Heseltine's campaign chairman Michael Mates was away for five days in the Middle East with the Defence Select Committee, of which he was chairman, so Heseltine's campaign did not have the cohesion of Major's, which was run by Norman Lamont. Heseltine's supporters, besides being older than those of the other candidates, tended to be pro-Europeans with a few populist backbenchers like David Evans, Tony Marlow and John Wilkinson.\n\nHeseltine, a self-made multi-millionaire, was photographed at his country mansion Thenford House, Northamptonshire, which played poorly when set aside the stress which Major placed on his humble origins in Brixton. Major was soon seen as having the potential to lead the Conservatives to another consecutive general election victory; especially after he matched Heseltine's pledge to review the poll tax. Although ordinary members did not then have a vote in party leadership elections, they made their views known: 485 local Conservative Associations backed Major, whilst only 65 backed Heseltine and 22 backed Hurd. Several MPs who backed Heseltine later faced attempts to deselect them as candidates. Thatcher lobbied hard, urging MPs who supported her to vote for Major. Around a third of the Conservative Parliamentary Party were the \"payroll vote\", ministers and PPSs, who could normally be expected to support the \"official\" line in votes.\n\nThe second round of voting took place on Tuesday 27 November 1990.\n<section begin=\"Second ballot: 27 November 1990\"/>\n<section end=\"Second ballot: 27 November 1990\"/>\n\nMajor, seen as relatively new blood in the government, secured a commanding lead (although with fewer votes than Thatcher had obtained in the first ballot) of 185 votes to Michael Heseltine's 131 votes and Douglas Hurd's 56.\n\nResearchers later found that around 20 MPs had voted for Thatcher in the first ballot then for Heseltine in the second. However, around 30 of Heseltine's first ballot supporters, including Jerry Hayes and David Mellor, had switched to Major, and about 10, including Steven Norris, had switched to Hurd, for a net loss of 21 votes.\n\nMajor was two votes short of an overall majority, requiring a third round to be held on 29 November 1990. However, within minutes of the result, Heseltine and Hurd withdrew from the contest in Major's favour. It was therefore announced by the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, Cranley Onslow, that no third round would be necessary, and that Major was elected unopposed.\n\n\"The Sun\", a firm supporter of Thatcher and her party since her election campaign in 1979, marked her resignation with the front-page headline \"MRS T-EARS\" on 23 November 1990, in reference to her breaking down in tears in front of her ministers after announcing her resignation. The accompanying photo also showed her in tears whilst being driven away from 10 Downing Street.\n\nLabour opposition leader Neil Kinnock (whose party had been ascendant in the opinion polls since the announcement of the Poll tax more than a year earlier) described Mrs Thatcher's resignation as \"good, very, very good indeed\" and called for an immediate general election.\n\nHenry Kissinger rang Downing Street \"in a very emotional state\" saying her decision to resign was \"worse than a death in the family\" and according to notes by Charles Powell \"Gorbachev had sent Shevardnadze [his foreign minister] out of a high level meeting in the Kremlin to telephone him, to find out what on earth was going on and how such a thing could be conceivable. The ambassador said that he had indeed found it very hard to explain. Indeed, there was a certain irony. Five years ago they had party coups in the Soviet Union and elections in Britain. Now it seemed to be the other way round\".\n\nJohn Major was declared the leader of the party on the evening of Tuesday 27 November 1990. Following Thatcher's formal resignation as Prime Minister, Queen Elizabeth II invited Major to form a government the next day. Douglas Hurd was re-appointed as Foreign Secretary and Michael Heseltine returned to the Cabinet as Environment Secretary, a post he had held in the early 1980s. Both Hurd and Heseltine remained key figures during the Major government, Heseltine eventually rising to become Deputy Prime Minister in 1995.\n\nMajor's premiership began well, and he was credited with restoring a consensual style of Cabinet government after the years of forceful leadership under Thatcher. The success of the First Gulf War in early 1991 contributed to strong public support. He secured some foreign policy successes in Europe, negotiating the Maastricht Treaty after securing an opt-out from the Social Chapter and the single currency, and he sprung a surprise victory in the 1992 election, securing a majority of 21 seats.\n\nNevertheless, the political tides soon turned. The government's reputation for economic competence was destroyed by Britain's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992. A notable protest came from Thatcher's former cabinet minister Norman Tebbit at the 1992 Party Conference, that the Conservatives had been wrong to ignore Thatcher's wishes to stay out (whether Britain entered the ERM at too high an exchange rate has been debated ever since). Apart from a brief period during the fuel protests in 2000, the Conservatives would not again enjoy an opinion poll lead until after the election of David Cameron as leader in 2005. The ongoing rebellion in the first half of 1993 by Conservative backbenchers against the passage of the Maastricht Treaty through the House of Commons was also deeply damaging to the government. Many of the Maastricht rebels were Thatcher supporters, and one of them, Teresa Gorman, devoted the opening chapter of her memoir of the incident to an account of the 1990 leadership contest.\n\nThe massive Conservative defeat in 1997 at the hands of Tony Blair and New Labour was thus attributable, at least in part, to the perception of internal division over Europe which had first been exposed by the 1990 leadership election. The Conservatives would not achieve the most seats in another general election until 2010, under David Cameron, and even then they fell short of an overall majority and had to form a government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. They would win a small 12-seat majority in 2015, only to lose it again at the 2017 general election but would win in a landslide in the 2019 United Kingdom general election.\n\nThe leadership contest was the subject of the 1991 TV movie \"\".\n\n"}

Such a jury will be composed of jurors who:\n\nThe creation of such a jury requires the striking during \"voir dire\" of jurors who express opposition to the death penalty such that they are unable or unwilling to set aside personal, moral, or emotional objections toward the supporting of a death sentence, and is designed to produce a \"fair and impartial\" jury of which the members will fairly consider all options, including the death penalty and life imprisonment.\n\nExpressing opposition to the death penalty does not automatically disqualify a juror. A party may attempt to rehabilitate the juror by asking questions as to whether, personal convictions notwithstanding, they might consider the death penalty. A juror who expresses exorbitant support for the death penalty who would thus otherwise be struck may be rehabilitated should they state a willingness to consider life imprisonment.\n\nThe use of a death-qualified jury was found to be consistent with the United States Constitution, most especially with the Sixth Amendment thereto, by the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Witherspoon v. Illinois\", and in \"Lockhart v. McCree\"; neither decision, though, mandated the use of death-qualified juries as against those containing jurors categorically unwilling to impose a penalty of death. It is in view of the \"Witherspoon\" decision that the process of one's death-qualifying a jury is, in the United States, referred to colloquially as \"Witherspooning a jury\".\n\nA poll commissioned by the Death Penalty Information Center on June 9, 2007, showed 57% of Americans believed they would qualify to be jurors in capital cases.\n\nThe bias imposed by the rule goes beyond the application of the death penalty itself. Several studies have found that death-qualified juries are made up of fewer women and minorities. Death-qualified juries are often criticized because they have a similar effect as excluding jurors based on race or gender, which intentional exclusion, in \"Batson v. Kentucky\" in 1986, was held as inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nEmpirical evidence adduced in \"Lockhart\" also has shown that death-qualified juries are more likely than other jurors to convict a defendant. That is, death-qualified jurors are more likely than non-death-qualified jurors to vote for conviction when assessing the same sets of facts. It is argued that since death-qualified juries over represent these groups there is a propensity to render guilty verdicts on cases of any type, including those in which the death penalty is not considered.\n"}
{"id": "2275849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275849", "title": "Rugila", "text": "Rugila\n\nRugila or Ruga (also Ruas; died second half of the 430s AD), was a ruler who was a major factor in the Huns' early victories over the Roman Empire. He served as an important forerunner with his brother Octar, with whom he initially ruled in dual kingship, possibly a geographical division where Rugila ruled over Eastern Huns while Octar over Western Huns, during the 5th century AD.\n\nThe name is mentioned in three variants, (Rougas), (Rouas), and (Roilas). Common spellings are Ruga, Roas, Rugila. Otto Maenchen-Helfen included this name among those of Germanic or Germanized origin, but without any derivation, only comparison with Rugemirus and Rugolf. Denis Sinor considered a name with initial \"r-\" not of Altaic origin (example Ragnaris).\n\nOmeljan Pritsak derived it from Old Turkic and considered it to be of composite form, with the change \"ουγα-\" > \"ουα\", Greek suffix \"-ς\", and those with \"ila\" as Gothicized variant. The Ancient Greek \"Ρ\" (Rho) rendered Hunnic \"*hr-\", which is Old Turkic \"*her\" > \"har/ar/er\" (man), common component of names and titles. Second part \"ουγα-\" or \"ουα\" resembles Old Turkic title \"ogä\" (to think). Thus the reconstruction goes \"*hēr ögä\" > \"*hər ögä\" > \"hrögä\".\n\nInitially Rugila had ruled together with his brother Octar, who died in 430 during a military campaign against the Burgundians. In 432, Rugila is mentioned as a sole ruler of the Huns. According to Prosper of Aquitaine, \"\"After the loss of his office, Aetius lived on his estate. When there some of his enemies by an unexpected attack attempted to seize him, he fled to Rome, and from there to Dalmatia. By the way of Pannonia, he reached the Huns. Through their friendship and help he obtained peace with the rulers and was reinstated in his old office. [] Ruga was ruler of the gens Chunorum\"\". Priscus recounts \"\"in the land of the Paeonians on the river Sava, which according to the treaty of Aetius, general of the Western Romans, belonged to the barbarian\"\", some scholars explain this as meaning that Aetius ceded part of Pannonia Prima to Ruga. Scholars date this cession to 425, 431, or 433. Maenchen-Helfen considered that the area was ceded to Attila.\n\nIn 422, there was a major Hunnic incursion into Thracia launched from Danube, menacing even Constantinople, which ended with a peace treaty by which Romans had to pay annually 350 pounds of gold. In 432-433, some tribes from Hunnic confederation on the Danube fled to Roman territory and service of Theodosius II. Rugila demanded through his experienced diplomat Esla (\"Ήσλα\", Turkic \"és-lä\", \"the great, old\"; later also served Attila) return of all fugitives, otherwise the peace will be terminated, but soon died and was succeeded by sons of his brother Mundzuk, Bleda and Attila, who became joint rulers of the united Hunnic tribes.\n\nThe Eastern Roman politician Plinta along \"quaestor\" Epigenes nevertheless had to go for adverse negotiations at Margus; according to Priscus, it included trade agreement, the annual tribute was raised to 700 pounds of gold, and fugitives were surrendered, among whom two of royal descent, Mamas (Μάμα, Christian name) and Atakam (\"Άτακάμ\", Turkic-Altaic \"ata-qām\", \"father pagan, priest\") probably because of conversion to Christianity, were crucified by the Huns at \"Carso\" (Hârșova).\n\nAccording to Socrates of Constantinople, Theodosius II prayed to God and managed to obtain what he sought - Ruga was struck dead by a thunderbolt, and among his men followed plague, and fire came down from the heaven consuming his survivors. This text is panegyric on Theodosius II, and happened shortly after 425 AD. Similarly, Theodoret recounts that God helped Theodosius II because he issued a law that ordered destruction of all pagan temples, and Ruga's death was \"the abundant harvest that followed these good seeds\". However, the edict was issued on November 14, 435 AD, so Ruga died after that date. Chronica Gallica of 452 places his death in 434, \"\"Aetius is restored to favor. Rugila, king of the Huns, with whom peace was made, dies. Bleda succeeds him\"\".\n\n"}

Vasilyevsky Island is separated from Dekabristov Island by the Smolenka River. Together they form the territory of Vasileostrovsky District, an administrative division of Saint Petersburg.\n\nSituated just across the river from the Winter Palace, it constitutes a large portion of the city's historic center. Two of the most famous St. Petersburg bridges, Palace Bridge and Blagoveshchensky Bridge, connect it with the mainland to the south. The Exchange Bridge and Tuchkov Bridge across the Malaya Neva connect it with Petrogradsky Island. Vasilyevsky Island is served by Vasileostrovskaya and Primorskaya stations of Saint Petersburg Metro (Line 3 ). There are plans to build new Metro stations on Vasilyevsky Island by extending Line 4 (the Orange Line) to the Island. In addition, the island is serviced by bus routes and tramway lines.\n\nOriginally, planners wanted Vasilyevsky Island to have canals in lieu of streets (similar to Venice). However, this plan never came to fruition and today the island has streets.\n\nSpeakers of Russian understand the name of the island as a possessive adjective made of the Russian masculine personal name Vasily (Basil), or possibly of the family name Vasilyev (derived from \"Vasily\").\n\nThere are various versions of who the original Vasily was, though these may be a product of false etymology, as the Russian name of the island may in fact be a corruption of its previous Swedish or Finnish name, because the island had been shown under them on Swedish maps before its present Russian history began after the Great Northern War.\n\nFirst Russian record of the island, and under virtually its modern name, is found in a registry book of 1500 land survey (\"Pistsovaya kniga\") of Votes' Pyatina (Vodskaya Pyatina) of Novgorod Republic.\n\nIt makes less probable another, a later one, Vassily-related etymology dating back to the 18th century. It is connected, like many other city legends, with the person of the founder of the present-day city, Peter the Great. One of his foremost gunner officers and military engineers, some Vassily Korchmin, had his artillery battery to ward off the Swedish navy at the spit of the island and got the tsar's letters addressed \"To Vassily in the Island\", thus making it another possible cause of the island's name. The man was commemorated by a lively statue in a pedestrian street in the island (see photo).\nFinnish etymology may lead to a corrupted compound word\nVasikkasaari, Calf Island. Another known Finnish name of the island was Hirvisaari - Elk (Moose) Island.\n\nGeographically, the island consists of two main parts. The south and east of the island are old, with buildings mostly from the 19th century. The southern embankment (with its western part named after St Petersburg University located there) has some of the oldest buildings in the city dated from 18th century. That part of the island is notable for its rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in Amsterdam), with three lengthwise thoroughfares called \"prospekts\" – \"Bolshoi\" (\"Big\"), \"Sredniy \"(\"Middle\") and \"Maly\" (\"Small\") – going roughly from east to west, and with about 30 crosswise \"Linii\" (Lines) forming about 15 peculiarly numbered streets going perpendicularly from south to north. The island boasts the city's narrowest street named after the artist Ilya Repin.\nThe easternmost tip of the island, called \"Strelka\" (spit, literally \"Arrow\"), features a number of museums, including the Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange (\"Bourse\") as well as two Rostral columns, and is a popular tourist attraction. The edifices lining the Universitetskaya Embankment along the Bolshaya Neva include the Kunstkamera, Twelve Collegia, Menshikov Palace, Imperial Academy of Sciences, and St. Andrew's Cathedral – all dating from the 18th century. In the island center there is a considerable Museum of electrical transport organised by transport history enthusiasts. It is based at the oldest Vasileostrovsky tram depot. Another recent notable attraction was an animated floating anchored illuminated musical fountain located just off the Spit.\n\nIn contrast with the Neva embankments in the historical center, the western part of the island was developed much later, in the late Soviet times, and has mostly typical Soviet apartment blocks. A monument to Vasily, the legendary Peter I's local gunners' battery commander after whom the island may have been named, was opened in 2003.\n\nThe principal buildings of Saint Petersburg State University are located on the island and include the Twelve Collegia by Domenico Tresini (1722–44) and the former palace of Peter II of Russia.\n\nIn recent centuries Vasilyevsky Island has provided a home both to academic life and to various industries.\n\nThe island's learning facilities have included the Imperial Academy of Sciences with its copious library, Saint Petersburg State University (including their Russian Language and Culture Institute), the 1st Army Cadet Corps (later the Military Academy of Supplies and Logistics) and the Naval Cadet Corps, and (among newer bodies) the Civil Service Academy (now termed the North-West Institute of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration). Many of these entities occupy historically significant buildings (for example the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute).\n\nThe Russian Academy of Sciences with its branches has always had many of its research institutions in its cradle - on the island. They include the institutes of: soils study, zoology, optics, aerial photography, Precambrian and general geology, polymers, world ethnography and anthropology, physiology, chemistry of silicate and fireproof compounds. Possibly best-known of the institutes, the Institute of Russian Literature (known as Pushkin House) holds manuscripts and archives of Russian prominent writers of the past and of the present.\n\nA number of institutions maintain museums, some of them open to the general public. Several require neither obligatory pre-booking nor pre-arranging groups-only visits (like Kunstkamera and the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Others require pre-organised visits, like the Literary Museum at Pushkin House or the Soils Study Museum\nof the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.\n\nThe island, like many other areas located around the city centre, has had a number of well-developed industries and factories, ranging from shipbuilding to making pianos and to industrial bread baking.\n\nNow, in a supposedly post-industrial era, a number of buildings of former factories have been converted to other usages, like the former Jacob Becker's Piano Factory.\n\nEnergy supply to many industrial facilities and housing in the island is provided by a cogeneration thermal power station.\n\nOne of three biggest Saint Petersburg shipyards is Baltiysky Zavod (\"Балтийский завод\" - Rus. for Baltic Shipyard ). Having had in recent years some financial difficulties, now it is recovering. There are private developers' plans to relocate the factory to Kronshtadt to make way for housing development schemes.\n\nAnother redevelopment spot is claimed to change part or all of the site of former Steel-rolling Plant (Staleprokatniy zavod - Rus. \"Сталепрокатный завод\"), presently known as Saint Petersburg Precision Alloys Foundry (Peterburgskiy zavod pretsezionnykh splavov).\n\nUntil recently, all of Saint Petersburg Metro escalators as well as those for all the underground railroad systems of the former Soviet Union were made since the 1950s at a local facility called Zavod \"Eskalator\", now known as LATRES (Rus. abbr. ЛАТРЭС). Now they produce moving staircases for shopping malls around Russia as well.\n\nA major producer of electric power and signal cables is Sevkabel (Rus. for North(ern) Cable (Factory)). Traditionally a branch of metal-processing, this industry now also includes production of optic fibre.\n\nMarine and consumer electronics have been designed produced at a number facilities in the island (see e.g. http://www.rimr.ru/eng/), one of them being a nationalized Siemens & Halske plant that was known in the Soviet times as (Nikolay) Kozitsky Plant making \"Raduga\" (Rus. for rainbow) colour television sets. Now it is a Raduga group company.\n\nLike every other district of Saint Petersburg in the Soviet times, the island has had its own industrial bakery (Rus. \"khlebozavod хлебозавод\") - Vasileostrovskiy khlebozavod, now a subsidiary of Fazer Group.\n\nThe Lutheran Church of Saint Michael was built on the island in 1874–1876.\n\n"}

{"id": "2275867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275867", "title": "Forensic chemistry", "text": "Forensic chemistry\n\nForensic chemistry is the application of chemistry and its subfield, forensic toxicology, in a legal setting. A forensic chemist can assist in the identification of unknown materials found at a crime scene. Specialists in this field have a wide array of methods and instruments to help identify unknown substances. These include high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thin layer chromatography. The range of different methods is important due to the destructive nature of some instruments and the number of possible unknown substances that can be found at a scene. Forensic chemists prefer using nondestructive methods first, to preserve evidence and to determine which destructive methods will produce the best results.\n\nAlong with other forensic specialists, forensic chemists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses regarding their findings. Forensic chemists follow a set of standards that have been proposed by various agencies and governing bodies, including the Scientific Working Group on the Analysis of Seized Drugs. In addition to the standard operating procedures proposed by the group, specific agencies have their own standards regarding the quality assurance and quality control of their results and their instruments. To ensure the accuracy of what they are reporting, forensic chemists routinely check and verify that their instruments are working correctly and are still able to detect and measure various quantities of different substances.\n\nForensic chemists' analysis can provide leads for investigators, and they can confirm or refute their suspicions. The identification of the various substances found at the scene can tell investigators what to look for during their search. During fire investigations, forensic chemists can determine if an accelerant such as gasoline or kerosene was used; if so, this suggests that the fire was intentionally set. Forensic chemists can also narrow down the suspect list to people who would have access to the substance used in a crime. For example, in explosive investigations, the identification of RDX or C-4 would indicate a military connection as those substances are military grade explosives. On the other hand, the identification of TNT would create a wider suspect list, since it is used by demolition companies as well as in the military. During poisoning investigations, the detection of specific poisons can give detectives an idea of what to look for when they are interviewing potential suspects. For example, an investigation that involves ricin would tell investigators to look for ricin's precursors, the seeds of the castor oil plant.\n\nForensic chemists also help to confirm or refute investigators' suspicions in drug or alcohol cases. The instruments used by forensic chemists can detect minute quantities, and accurate measurement can be important in crimes such as driving under the influence as there are specific blood alcohol content cutoffs where penalties begin or increase. In suspected overdose cases, the quantity of the drug found in the person's system can confirm or rule out overdose as the cause of death.\n\nThroughout history, a variety of poisons have been used to commit murder, including arsenic, nightshade, hemlock, strychnine, and curare. Until the early 19th century, there were no methods to accurately determine if a particular chemical was present, and poisoners were rarely punished for their crimes. In 1836, one of the first major contributions to forensic chemistry was introduced by British chemist James Marsh. He created the Marsh test for arsenic detection, which was subsequently used successfully in a murder trial. It was also during this time that forensic toxicology began to be recognized as a distinct field. Mathieu Orfila, the \"father of toxicology\", made great advancements to the field during the early 19th century. A pioneer in the development of forensic microscopy, Orfila contributed to the advancement of this method for the detection of blood and semen. Orfila was also the first chemist to successfully classify different chemicals into categories such as corrosives, narcotics, and astringents.\n\nThe next advancement in the detection of poisons came in 1850 when a valid method for detecting vegetable alkaloids in human tissue was created by chemist Jean Stas. Stas's method was quickly adopted and used successfully in court to convict Count Hippolyte Visart de Bocarmé of murdering his brother-in-law by nicotine poisoning. Stas was able to successfully isolate the alkaloid from the organs of the victim. Stas's protocol was subsequently altered to incorporate tests for caffeine, quinine, morphine, strychnine, atropine, and opium.\n\nThe wide range of instrumentation for forensic chemical analysis also began to be developed during this time period. The early 19th century saw the invention of the spectroscope by Joseph von Fraunhofer. In 1859, chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff expanded on Fraunhofer's invention. Their experiments with spectroscopy showed that specific substances created a unique spectrum when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. Using spectroscopy, the two scientists were able to identify substances based on their spectrum, providing a method of identification for unknown materials. In 1906 botanist Mikhail Tsvet invented paper chromatography, an early predecessor to thin layer chromatography, and used it to separate and examine the plant proteins that make up chlorophyll. The ability to separate mixtures into their individual components allows forensic chemists to examine the parts of an unknown material against a database of known products. By matching the retention factors for the separated components with known values, materials can be identified.\n\nModern forensic chemists rely on numerous instruments to identify unknown materials found at a crime scene. The 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately. The first major advancement in this century came during the 1930s with the invention of a spectrometer that could measure the signal produced with infrared (IR) light. Early IR spectrometers used a monochromator and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band. It was not until the coupling of an interferometer with an IR spectrometer in 1949 by Peter Fellgett that the complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once. Fellgett also used the Fourier transform, a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies, to make sense of the enormous amount of data received from the complete infrared analysis of a material. Since then, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments have become critical in the forensic analysis of unknown material because they are nondestructive and extremely quick to use. Spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with the invention of the modern atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer by Alan Walsh. AA analysis can detect specific elements that make up a sample along with their concentrations, allowing for the easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium.\n\nAdvancements in the field of chromatography arrived in 1953 with the invention of the gas chromatograph by Anthony T. James and Archer John Porter Martin, allowing for the separation of volatile liquid mixtures with components which have similar boiling points. Nonvolatile liquid mixtures could be separated with liquid chromatography, but substances with similar retention times could not be resolved until the invention of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Csaba Horváth in 1970. Modern HPLC instruments are capable of detecting and resolving substances whose concentrations are as low as parts per trillion.\n\nOne of the most important advancements in forensic chemistry came in 1955 with the invention of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) by Fred McLafferty and Roland Gohlke. The coupling of a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer allowed for the identification of a wide range of substances. GC-MS analysis is widely considered the \"gold standard\" for forensic analysis due to its sensitivity and versatility along with its ability to quantify the amount of substance present. The increase in the sensitivity of instrumentation has advanced to the point that minute impurities within compounds can be detected potentially allowing investigators to trace chemicals to a specific batch and lot from a manufacturer.\n\nForensic chemists rely on a multitude of instruments to identify unknown substances found at a scene. Different methods can be used to determine the identity of the same substance, and it is up to the examiner to determine which method will produce the best results. Factors that forensic chemists might consider when performing an examination are the length of time a specific instrument will take to examine a substance and the destructive nature of that instrument. They prefer using nondestructive methods first, to preserve the evidence for further examination. Nondestructive techniques can also be used to narrow down the possibilities, making it more likely that the correct method will be used the first time when a destructive method is used.\n\nThe two main standalone spectroscopy techniques for forensic chemistry are FTIR and AA spectroscopy. FTIR is a nondestructive process that uses infrared light to identify a substance. The attenuated total reflectance sampling technique eliminates the need for substances to be prepared before analysis. The combination of nondestructiveness and zero preparation makes ATR FTIR analysis a quick and easy first step in the analysis of unknown substances. To facilitate the positive identification of the substance, FTIR instruments are loaded with databases that can be searched for known spectra that match the unknown's spectra. FTIR analysis of mixtures, while not impossible, presents specific difficulties due to the cumulative nature of the response. When analyzing an unknown that contains more than one substance, the resulting spectra will be a combination of the individual spectra of each component. While common mixtures have known spectra on file, novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve, making FTIR an unacceptable means of identification. However, the instrument can be used to determine the general chemical structures present, allowing forensic chemists to determine the best method for analysis with other instruments. For example, a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3,030 and 2,950 wavenumbers (cm).\n\nAtomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a destructive technique that is able to determine the elements that make up the analyzed sample. AAS performs this analysis by subjecting the sample to an extremely high heat source, breaking the atomic bonds of the substance, leaving free atoms. Radiation in the form of light is then passed through the sample forcing the atoms to jump to a higher energy state. Forensic chemists can test for each element by using a corresponding wavelength of light that forces that element's atoms to a higher energy state during the analysis. For this reason, and due to the destructive nature of this method, AAS is generally used as a confirmatory technique after preliminary tests have indicated the presence of a specific element in the sample. The concentration of the element in the sample is proportional to the amount of light absorbed when compared to a blank sample. AAS is useful in cases of suspected heavy metal poisoning such as with arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium. The concentration of the substance in the sample can indicate whether heavy metals were the cause of death.\n\nSpectroscopy techniques are useful when the sample being tested is pure, or a very common mixture. When an unknown mixture is being analyzed it must be broken down into its individual parts. Chromatography techniques can be used to break apart mixtures into their components allowing for each part to be analyzed separately. \n\nThin layer chromatography (TLC) is a quick alternative to more complex chromatography methods. TLC can be used to analyze inks and dyes by extracting the individual components. This can be used to investigate notes or fibers left at the scene since each company's product is slightly different and those differences can be seen with TLC. The only limiting factor with TLC analysis is the necessity for the components to be soluble in whatever solution is used to carry the components up the analysis plate. This solution is called the mobile phase. The forensic chemist can compare unknowns with known standards by looking at the distance each component travelled. This distance, when compared to the starting point, is known as the retention factor (R) for each extracted component. If each R value matches a known sample, that is an indication of the unknown's identity.\n\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography can be used to extract individual components from a mixture dissolved in a solution. HPLC is used for nonvolatile mixtures that would not be suitable for gas chromatography. This is useful in drug analysis where the pharmaceutical is a combination drug since the components would separate, or elute, at different times allowing for the verification of each component. The eluates from the HPLC column are then fed into various detectors that produce a peak on a graph relative to its concentration as it elutes off the column. The most common type of detector is an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer as the most common item of interest tested with HPLC, pharmaceuticals, have UV absorbance.\n\nGas chromatography (GC) performs the same function as liquid chromatography, but it is used for volatile mixtures. In forensic chemistry, the most common GC instruments use mass spectrometry as their detector. GC-MS can be used in investigations of arson, poisoning, and explosions to determine exactly what was used. In theory, GC-MS instruments can detect substances whose concentrations are in the femtogram () range. However, in practice, due to signal-to-noise ratios and other limiting factors, such as the age of the individual parts of the instrument, the practical detection limit for GC-MS is in the picogram () range. GC-MS is also capable of quantifying the substances it detects; chemists can use this information to determine the effect the substance would have on an individual. GC-MS instruments need around 1,000 times more of the substance to quantify the amount than they need simply to detect it; the limit of quantification is typically in the nanogram () range.\n\nForensic toxicology is the study of the pharmacodynamics, or what a substance does to the body, and pharmacokinetics, or what the body does to the substance. To accurately determine the effect a particular drug has on the human body, forensic toxicologists must be aware of various levels of drug tolerance that an individual can build up as well as the therapeutic index for various pharmaceuticals. Toxicologists are tasked with determining whether any toxin found in a body was the cause of or contributed to an incident, or whether it was at too low a level to have had an effect. While the determination of the specific toxin can be time-consuming due to the number of different substances that can cause injury or death, certain clues can narrow down the possibilities. For example, carbon monoxide poisoning would result in bright red blood while death from hydrogen sulfide poisoning would cause the brain to have a green hue.\n\nToxicologists are also aware of the different metabolites that a specific drug could break down into inside the body. For example, a toxicologist can confirm that a person took heroin by the presence in a sample of 6-monoacetylmorphine, which only comes from the breakdown of heroin. The constant creation of new drugs, both legal and illicit, forces toxicologists to keep themselves apprised of new research and methods to test for these novel substances. The stream of new formulations means that a negative test result does not necessarily rule out drugs. To avoid detection, illicit drug manufacturers frequently change the chemicals' structure slightly. These compounds are often not detected by routine toxicology tests and can be masked by the presence of a known compound in the same sample. As new compounds are discovered, known spectra are determined and entered into the databases that can be downloaded and used as reference standards. Laboratories also tend to keep in-house databases for the substances they find locally.\n\nGuidelines have been set up by various governing bodies regarding the standards that are followed by practicing forensic scientists. For forensic chemists, the international Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (SWGDRUG) presents recommendations for the quality assurance and quality control of tested materials. In the identification of unknown samples, protocols have been grouped into three categories based on the probability for false positives. Instruments and protocols in category A are considered the best for uniquely identifying an unknown material, followed by categories B and then C. To ensure the accuracy of identifications SWGDRUG recommends that multiple tests using different instruments be performed on each sample, and that one category A technique and at least one other technique be used. If a category A technique is not available, or the forensic chemist decides not to use one, SWGDRUG recommends that at least three techniques be used, two of which must be from category B. Combination instruments, such as GC-MS, are considered two separate tests as long as the results are compared to known values individually For example, the GC elution times would be compared to known values along with the MS spectra. If both of those match a known substance, no further tests are needed.\n\nStandards and controls are necessary in the quality control of the various instruments used to test samples. Due to the nature of their work in the legal system, chemists must ensure that their instruments are working accurately. To do this, known controls are tested consecutively with unknown samples. By comparing the readouts of the controls with their known profiles the instrument can be confirmed to have been working properly at the time the unknowns were tested. Standards are also used to determine the instrument's limit of detection and limit of quantification for various common substances. Calculated quantities must be above the limit of detection to be confirmed as present and above the limit of quantification to be quantified. If the value is below the limit the value is not considered reliable.\n\nThe standardized procedures for testimony by forensic chemists are provided by the various agencies that employ the scientists as well as SWGDRUG. Forensic chemists are ethically bound to present testimony in a neutral manner and to be open to reconsidering their statements if new information is found. Chemists should also limit their testimony to areas they have been qualified in regardless of questions during direct or cross-examination.\n\nIndividuals called to testify must be able to relay scientific information and processes in a manner that lay individuals can understand. By being qualified as an expert, chemists are allowed to give their opinions on the evidence as opposed to just stating the facts. This can lead to competing opinions from experts hired by the opposing side. Ethical guidelines for forensic chemists require that testimony be given in an objective manner, regardless of what side the expert is testifying for. Forensic experts that are called to testify are expected to work with the lawyer who issued the summons and to assist in their understanding of the material they will be asking questions about.\n\nForensic chemistry positions require a bachelor's degree or similar in a natural or physical science as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, and analytical chemistry. Once in the position, individuals are trained in the protocols that are performed at that specific lab until they can prove they are competent to perform all experiments without supervision.. Practicing chemists already in the field are expected to have continuing education to maintain their proficiency.\n"}

Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government\n\nAlaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, 522 U.S. 520 (1998), was a United States Supreme Court case. The local tribal council in Venetie, Alaska, wanted to collect tax from non-tribal members doing business on tribal lands. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had ruled in the tribe's favor, saying they occupied Indian Country.\n\nThe Court decided unanimously that the land was not the tribe's land subject to the tribal tax, even though it was owned by the tribe, because it was not part of a Native American reservation. Because all but one reservation in Alaska (the Annette Island reservation of the Tsimshian) had been eliminated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, the decision had the practical effect of prohibiting almost all Indian tribes in Alaska from collecting taxes for activities conducted on tribal land. Taxing authority is reserved as a right of the states and federal government.\n\nThe State of Alaska, the petitioner, was represented by John G. Roberts, who later became the Chief Justice of the United States. The respondent was represented by Heather Kendall-Miller, an attorney of Athabascan descent.\n"}

He was elected as successor to his father, Amadu II of Masina, in 1853. Throughout most of his rule he was involved in conflict with the jihadist al-Hajj 'Umar Tall, who defeated and executed him on 16 May 1862.\n\nAmadu III was the grandson of the founder of the Diina of Hamdullahi, Seku Amadu. Some time between 1810 and 1818 Seku Amadu (Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Abi Bakr Lobbo) launched a \"jihad\" against the Fulbe chiefs in Masina, tributaries of the pagan Bambara of Segu, whom he accused of idolatry. \nThe goals of the \"jihad\" soon expanded to that of conquest of the Bambara and others in the region.\nAḥmad bin Muḥammad established a large empire based on Hamdallahi, which he had founded as the capital.\nHe received support from Tukolor and Fulbe people who were seeking independence from the Bamabara, although later he met resistance from these people when he imposed a rigorous Islamic theocracy based on the Maliki interpretation of Sharia law. The state was ruled by a council of forty elders, who gave directions to provincial governors. Most of the governors were related to Aḥmad bin Muḥammad.\nWhen Aḥmad bin Muḥammad died in 1844, he was succeeded by his son Aḥmad bin Aḥmad (Amadu II), father of Amadu III.\n\nAhmadu II was killed in 1852 during a raid on the Bambara.\nHe had nominated his son as his successor.\nIn 1853 Amadu III was elected to the position of \"Almami\" of the Diina in accordance with his father's wishes.\nAnother candidate for election, Ba Lobbo, was passed over but remained influential as a member of the Tijani faction at court. \nBa Lobbo was Amadu's uncle, and a leader in the army.\n\nAlthough less learned than his grandfather and father, Aḥmad III continued their highly puritanical Islamic practices such as banning the use of tobacco and requiring full segregation of men and women.\nHowever, he was less rigid in matters of Islamic education and control, more willing to follow traditions of Fulbe social structure.\nDuring his rule tensions mounted between the more puritanical Tijaniyyah minority and the more relaxed Qadiriyya community.\nWhen the German traveler Heinrich Barth reached Timbuktu in September 1853, \nhe was given the protection of Aḥmad al-Bakkāy, the political and religious leader of the Kunta, \nwho refused Aḥmad III's demands to hand him over.\nAmadu ordered Barth's death as an infidel.\nThe Hamdullahi forces threatened him several times during his travels in the Middle Niger.\n\nThe struggle with Segu continued in the early part of his rule, and Amadu III continued to dispatch raids deep into Segu territory until 1855.\nHe tried to gain control of Sinsani so he could use its forces in his conflict with Segu.\n\nThe Tukolor religious and military leader al-Hajj 'Umar Tall, originally from Futa Toro, launched a \"jihad\" against unbelievers in 1853. He quickly overran many of the Bambara and Malinke states in the upper parts of the Senegal and Niger basins.\nAfter defeating the Bambara state of Kaarta in 1855, 'Umar proposed an alliance with Aḥmadu III to conquer the Bambara state of Segu. \nAḥmadu may have suspected 'Umar's motives, and instead sent an army to attack 'Umar, which was defeated at Kassakeri in Kaarta by 'Umar's forces in 1856. \nRecognizing that the Masina troops were Muslim, 'Umar had their wounded treated and returned.\nThis contrasted with his treatment of pagan prisoners.\n\nAfter the defeat, one of Amadu's main advisors, al Hajj Seidou, urged him to make common cause with Bina 'Alī, the \"Fama\" (king) of Segu against 'Umar.\nWhen al-Hajj 'Umar attacked Segu in 1861, Aḥmadu III lent aid to Bina 'Alī on condition that he accept Islam. \nIn January 1861 the Hamdullahi army was mobilized under the leadership of Ba Lobbo with 8,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry and 1,000 musketeers and was joined at Tio, opposite Sinsani on the right bank of the Niger, by what was left of the Segu forces.\nIn mid-February two fleets of canoes clashed in mid-stream.\nAbout 500 of Umar's troops attacked a village near Tio on their own initiative, were caught and destroyed.\nThe next day Umar split his army into two wings, which crossed the river at night, crushed the forces of Masina and Segu at Tio and marched on to the capital of Segu. There they looted the treasures held in the Jara storehouses. In March 1861, Ba Lobbo regrouped his army and advanced towards Segu, but was defeated once more by 'Umar's forces.\n\n'Umar faced criticism in his war against Masina, since its people were Muslims.\nAs proof that 'Alī's conversion was a sham, 'Umar collected idols in Segu that had not been destroyed.\n'Umar issued a \"Bayan\" in which he said that Ahmadu had accepted \"a thousand \"mithqals\" of gold\" in return for supporting 'Ali.\nIn a public exchange of letters, 'Umar clearly demonstrated his superior Islamic learning.\n'Umar may have been trying to win over the Tijanis under Ba Lobbo.\nAn attempt to arrange peace between Aḥmadu III and 'Umar was not successful, and 'Umar invaded Masina.\n\nIn 1862 'Umar advanced into Masina, receiving deserters and meeting little resistance.\nAmadu III was joined by the Kunta under Ahmad al-Bekkay, who had until then been his enemies but supported him in the face of aggression by a Muslim, \nwhich was contrary to the law.\nBefore the decisive battle 'Umar proposed to fight a duel with Aḥmadu III, but the latter refused.\nAḥmadu was defeated in battle on 15 May 1862, and 'Umar occupied Hamdallahi.\nAḥmadu was captured and decapitated.\nBa Lobbo briefly continued resistance against the Tokolor, but the death of Amadu III and the loss of Hamdullahi marked the end of the Massina Empire as an effective force in the region.\n\nDespite al-Hajj 'Umar's eloquent justifications, the controversy over the war against the Muslim state of Masina continued after the death of Amadu III. \nA revolt broke out against 'Umar in 1863, and he was killed in 1864.\nAlthough 'Umar did not have time to establish control of Masina, his nephew al-Tijānī (Tidiani Tall) succeeded. \nIt was not until 1897 that the French took control of the region.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

The discovery of the nature of the galaxy was accredited to Knut Lundmark and Philibert Jacques Melotte in 1926. It is in the constellation Cetus.\n\nIn 1994, A. E. Dolphin used the Hubble Space Telescope to create a color–magnitude diagram for WLM. It showed that around half of all the star formation in this galaxy occurred during a starburst that started ~13 Gyr ago. During the starburst, the metallicity of WLM rose from [Fe/H] ~ −2.2 to [Fe/H] −1.3. There being no horizontal-branch population, Dolphin concludes that no more than per Myr of star formation occurred in the period from 12 to 15 Gyr ago. From 2.5 to 9 Gyr ago, the mean rate of star formation was 100 to per Myr. Being at the edge of the Local Group has also protected WLM from interactions and mergers with other galaxies, giving it a \"pristine\" stellar population and state that make it particularly useful for comparative studies.\n\nWLM has one known globular cluster (PGC 910901) at that Hodge et al. (1999) determined having an absolute magnitude of −8.8 and a metallicity of –1.5, with an age of ~15 billion years. This cluster has a luminosity that is slightly over the average for all globulars. The seeming lack of faint low-mass globular clusters cannot be explained by the weak tidal forces of the WLM system.\n\nIn E. E. Smith’s Lensman novels, the \"Second Galaxy\" is identified as \"Lundmark's Nebula\". However, some believe the \"Second Galaxy\" may not be the Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte galaxy, since the first chapter of the first novel in the series (\"Triplanetary\") and the series-establishing material appearing at the beginning of subsequent novels states that the \"Second Galaxy\" and the \"First Galaxy\" (the Milky Way) collided and passed through each other \"edge-on\" during the \"planet-forming era\"—implying that the \"Lundmark's Nebula\" of the series must necessarily be obscured from view by the Milky Way; however, according to others, it could have passed through at an angle and thus be identified with the galaxy described in this article; some have stated that this is the galaxy that E.E. Smith was thinking of when he wrote the series. However, the distance to Lundmark's nebula is defined quite precisely in \"Grey Lensman\" as approximately 24 million parsecs, much larger than the distance to Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte (approximately 930,000 parsecs). Additionally, in \"Second Stage Lensmen\" multiple references are made to the spiral arms of Lundmark's Nebula. Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte does not possess such structures. At the time of writing of these books, the name of Lundmark was associated with such classifications and Smith may have elected to use this as a \"believable\" name for an entirely fictional galaxy.\n\nAt the time the Lensman series was written, most astronomers favored the tidal theory of Solar System formation, which required that planets be formed by the close approach of another star. In order to produce the massive numbers of planets necessary to evolve into galactic civilizations in both the Milky Way and Lundmark's Nebula, as portrayed in the \"Lensman\" series, E.E. Smith thought it would have been necessary for another galaxy to have passed through the Milky Way to produce the large number of close encounters necessary to form so many planets.\n\nThe \"Doctor Who\" novel \"Synthespians™\" by Craig Hinton refers to the New Earth Republic of the 101st Century and beyond, which spearheads a programme of colonisation, sending sleeper ships to the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and Andromeda.\n"}

Both the Armored Troopers and their pilots are also known as VOTOMS (Vertical One-man Tank for Offense & ManeuverS). However, since Armored Troopers have extremely thin armor, and use a highly combustible liquid in their artificial muscle, their pilots have a very low chance of survival, and are commonly referred to instead as \"Bottoms\", the lowest of the low (\"Votoms\" and \"Bottoms\" are written and pronounced the same way in Japanese).\n\nThe series follows a main character named Chirico Cuvie, a special forces Armored Trooper pilot and former member of the Red Shoulder Battalion, an elite force used by the Gilgamesh Confederation in its war against the Balarant Union.

The wealth of his family afforded young Isaac an education in Europe, along with his brothers. Huger began his military career by serving as an officer in Colonel Thomas Middleton's Provincial South Carolina Regiment during the expedition against the Cherokees in 1761.\n\nWhile serving as a representative for the parishes of St. Philip and St. Michael in the First Provincial Congress of South Carolina, Huger was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the South Carolina militia and later commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 1st South Carolina Regiment on June 17, 1775. He was promoted to colonel on September 16, 1776, and appointed commander of the 5th South Carolina Regiment. On January 9, 1779, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Continental Army. It was at his home, near Beaufort, that Lafayette, in 1777, at age 19, landed in America to help against the British. Lafayette would become lifelong friend with Huger and Huger's son, who would repay that friendship by trying to rescue Lafayette from Austrian prison twenty years later.\n\nBrigadier General Huger fought and was wounded at the Battle of Stono Ferry on June 20, 1779 and commanded the South Carolina and Georgia militia during the Siege of Savannah on October 9, 1779.\n\nDuring the siege of Charleston in the spring of 1780, he was placed in command of the light horse and militia outside the city. A surprise attack by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton's forces routed and dispersed Huger's troops at Monck's Corner on the morning of April 14, 1780. Illness kept Huger from capture with the surrender of Charleston, and he later rejoined the Southern army under Major General Horatio Gates in North Carolina.\n\nHe was present when Major General Nathanael Greene took command of the Southern Department in Charlotte later in December. Greene detached his light forces to the western parts of South Carolina and moved his regulars to a camp in the Cheraws, with Huger as his second-in-command. After the brilliant American victory at Cowpens, Huger was entrusted by Greene to lead the command posted in the Cheraws to rejoin the detached light forces in North Carolina. At the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, 1781, he commanded a brigade of Virginia Continental regiments and was slightly wounded in action. Commanding the same brigade at the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill on April 25, Huger initially stood his ground after the unanticipated withdrawal of the right wing of the American line. With the retreat of the British from the interior to Charleston, General Huger was reunited with his family and returned to his home, ending his combative service.\n\nIsaac Huger represented St. George Dorchester in the Jacksonborough Assembly in January 1782 and served in the legislature until his election as Sheriff of Charleston District in 1785. Familial ties led to his appointment as the first federal marshal for South Carolina in 1789, a position which he held for five years. Isaac Huger married Elizabeth Chalmers on March 23, 1762 and was the father of eight children. He died in Charleston.\n\n"}

In this episode, two simultaneous plotlines unfold. Chief of Operations O'Brien is recruited to save a Bajoran village from destruction. Back on the station, Commander Sisko arbitrates a land dispute between two factions of Bajorans, the Paqu and the Navot, while the adolescent leader of the Paqu (for whom Nog develops a crush) learns the art of compromise.\n\nThe matte painting of the Bajoran village is the same matte painting from the \"\" \"\" episodes (Season 6, Episode 16 & 17) in which it depicted the colony of Romulan and Klingon survivors from the Khitomer massacre.\n\nO'Brien and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Bashir are sent on a relief mission to Bajor in response to a medical emergency. Meanwhile on the station, Sisko plays mediator in a conflict between two rival Bajoran factions negotiating a border dispute.\n\nThe leader of one of the factions, Tetrarch Varis Sul, is a fifteen-year-old girl. She proves unwilling to negotiate, and Sisko is frustrated with her intransigence.\n\nNog is captivated by the girl. He and Sisko's son, Jake, introduce themselves to her, and she agrees to spend time with them. She is stressed by the negotiations, but Nog suggests that problems can become opportunities.\n\nTo cheer her up, the three embark on a prank to steal Security Chief Odo's regeneration bucket. Nog fills the bucket with oatmeal and pretends to trip, covering Jake with the contents.\n\nVaris apologises to Sisko for her involvement in the escapade. They discuss the challenges of leadership, and she eventually agrees to propose a compromise resolution to the border dispute.\n\nResponding to the distress call, Bashir and O'Brien find that a man called the Sirah is dying, and the village leader, Faren, claims that a force called the \"Dal'Rok\" will destroy the village if the Sirah is not able to fend it off. \n\nThat night, the Sirah speaks to the entire village as a threatening cloudlike apparition appears in the sky. The Sirah tells a narrative about the village defeating the Dal'Rok. He collapses during his speech, but he whispers the rest of the story to O'Brien, who repeats it; and as the villagers cheer, a beam of light seems to make the apparition disappear. By the time the Dal'Rok is gone the Sirah has died, and Faren declares O'Brien to be his successor. \n\nThe next day, the villagers treat O'Brien like a king. The old Sirah's apprentice, Hovath, attempts to kill O'Brien, declaring himself to be the true Sirah. He reveals that the Dal'Rok was created by the first Sirah, using an Orb fragment, to solve the internal strife tearing apart the village. When the villagers unite in their thoughts to stop it, the Sirah secretly uses the fragment to channel their thoughts. Hovath had had his chance to lead the village against the Dal'Rok earlier that week, and failed. \n\nThat night, O'Brien stands before the village and attempts to tell the story, but the villagers are unmoved by his clumsy narrative, and the Dal'Rok returns in full force. Hovath takes the stage, and eloquently tells of a new voice challenging the Dal'Rok. The villagers follow his lead and defeat the Dal'Rok, embracing him as their new Sirah and relieving O'Brien of the post.\n\nIn 2019, ScreenRant reported that IMDb users had rated this episode as one of the ten worst episodes of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\n\n\n"}

While not a critical and commercial success, it later developed as a cult film, particularly a \"so bad it's good\" film.\n\nOn an alien planet named Pluton, an alien garbage disposal converts a monstrous mutant called a Hungry Beast into energy and beams it into space. Meanwhile, on Earth, the Putterman family is getting satellite television, courtesy of a temperamental DIY satellite antenna. The reception is poor at first, but suddenly strengthens when a bolt of the alien energy hits the dish.\n\nSherman Putterman and his ex-military, survivalist grandfather set out to enjoy a night of horror films hosted by the buxom Medusa. Meanwhile, Sherman's parents go out to meet some swingers and his sister Suzy goes out with her rocker boyfriend O.D. Sherman and his grandfather eventually fall asleep, but are awakened when the Hungry Beast materializes out of the TV and eats the grandfather. Sherman's parents later arrive along with swingers Cherry and Spiro. Despite Sherman's plea, his mother locks him in the fallout shelter so he will not ruin their evening.\n\nSherman tries calling the police, but they take him to be a prank caller. He also calls Medusa, but she dismisses him as a psychotic. Later, the Beast travels through the television into the house's sex-themed \"Pleasure Dome\", eats Cherry, and imitates her to lure Spiro. Sherman's parents also get eaten after they discover the remains of the swingers. Sherman uses some plastic explosive to break out of the bunker as O.D. and his sister arrive.\n\nSherman's sister doesn't believe his story about a monster, and when they check their parents' room, they find imitations of them, their grandfather and the swingers. Soon after though, they encounter the Beast in another room. It chases after them, but relents at the sight of O.D.'s heavy metal paraphernalia, which he finds appealing due to its resemblance of his caretaker's gloves. They then discover that they can subdue the Beast with food and television, and teach it a few words such as \"TV\", \"music\" and their names. They consider using the Beast for profit, and call Medusa in the hope of securing a TV appearance. She is initially dismissive, but shows interest when they promise to hold a party.\n\nHowever, the Beast becomes enraged and eats O.D. when its alien captor appears on the TV to warn the earthlings that they must destroy their television equipment to prevent the Beast from spreading. A police officer arrives to arrest Sherman for the prank calls only to be eaten by the Beast. Sherman breaks all the TVs he can find, and eventually the Pluton alien captor appears through the television to exterminate the Beast. Medusa arrives at the house and kills the Pluton Alien, mistakenly believing that he is in fact the Beast that Sherman and Suzy have described to her. When the real monster arrives, it sucks the group of three into its mouth with a powerful gust of air.\n\nThe next morning, Medusa's chauffeur is woken up by a crude imitation of his employer hiding in the back seat of his car, demanding to be taken to the TV station.\n\n\nThe soundtrack to the film was originally released on vinyl by Restless Records in 1986. It was reissued in 2017 on CD by Intrada Records.\nIn addition to Richard Band's original score, several songs (including the movie's theme) were contributed by Los Angeles art rock band The Fibonaccis. \"TerrorVision\" was hoped to bring more attention to the group, but the movie (and ultimately the soundtrack) failed.\n\nThe track listing was as follows::\n\n\nThe film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Empire Pictures in February 1986. It grossed $320,256 at the box office.\n\nIn 2007, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released a widescreen version of the film on Showtime.\n\nIn 2012, Shout! Factory announced that they would be releasing the film on DVD and Blu-ray as part of their Scream Factory lineup. A DVD/Blu-ray double feature of \"TerrorVision/The Video Dead\" was released in February 2013.\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" said, \"The film's style is so smugly stupid that it's hard to tell whether the creatures, dripping with primordial ooze, are any less attractive than the Puttermans\" and also called the film \"noisly [sic] campy without being the least bit clever.\" \"Variety\" dismissed it as \"an uninvolving sci-fi thriller comedy that relies heavily for its shock value on gooey monster effects rather than cinematic finesse ... With the apparent intent of making some comments about our unnatural reliance on television, and technology in general, filmmakers have perhaps bit off too much.\" Writing in the \"Chicago Tribune\", Rick Kogan gave the film 1 star out of 4 and called it \"a certifiably bad movie\" with \"a good deal that is distasteful,\" but also found it \"strangely likable\" because Ted Nicolaou \"has done a better job than most who have tackled this particular beat. He has a nice feel for pacing if not for tension, a good eye for detail if often excessive and an occasional burst of humor.\" Patrick Goldstein of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"There are a few wonderful moments scattered throughout the picture, clearly the kind of goofy monster mash that should be seen long after midnight when your brain is operating at half-speed ... But to mix up the gross-outs with gags you need a good curve ball — the jokes should have a real spin to them. That weird comic rhythm is missing here. In fact, Nicolaou has such a terrible sense of timing that the scenes drag on long after every laugh has been squeezed dry.\" \"Pop Matters\" called \"\"TerrorVision\" \"a truly wretched movie.\"\n\nAs of July 2019, \"TerrorVision\" currently holds a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews.\n\n"}

It runs from Sligo to Lifford, County Donegal. It forms part of the proposed Atlantic Corridor route.\n\nThe N15 commences halfway across \"Lifford Bridge\" (which crosses the River Foyle between County Donegal and County Tyrone), continuing the route of the A38 (from Strabane on the east side of the river). In Lifford, west of the River Foyle, the N14 meets the N15, ending at a junction in the town centre. The N15 leaves to the southwest, changing to run west at the point just west of Clady. It continues west through Castlefin, Liscooley and Killygordon to reach Stranorlar.\n\nIn Stranorlar, the N13 commences, leaving the N15 to head north, with the N15 itself turning southwest to cross the River Finn to enter Ballybofey. From here, it continues southwest through the mountains and Barnesmore Gap (passing southeast of Bluestack Mountain) towards Donegal Town. East of the town itself, the N56 road starts at a junction on the N15 and runs around the north of the town, with the N15 turning to the south, to bypass the eastern side of Donegal Town. The N15 crosses the Drummenny Burn on the eastern outskirts of Donegal Town.\n\nSouth of Donegal Town, the N15 passes by Ballintra to the west. Further south, the route follows a road opened in 2006, bypassing Ballyshannon to the east and crossing the River Erne on a viaduct.\n\nThe road enters County Leitrim in the west of Ireland, directly west of Bundoran (the bypass passes south of the town). Tullaghan is the only village along the N15 in the county, also bypassed.\n\nThe N15 runs closer to the coastline in County Sligo, passing through Cliffoney and Grange as it proceeds southwest. The road then passes through the villages of Drumcliff and Rathcormack before entering Sligo. The route ends at the start of the N4, which continues through the town as the \"Sligo Inner Relief Road\" dual carriageway.\n\nThe route between Lifford and Stranorlar is a single carriageway road of very poor quality. A replacement of the current alignment with a new single carriageway road is planned, bypassing Castlefin, Liscooley, and Killygordon. This will connect with a 2+1 bypass of Stranorlar and Ballybofey which is also planned. This will bypass the towns to the south, with a new crossing of the River Finn.\n\nThe N15 runs for over in County Sligo, passing north of the mountains and around Benbulbin before turning around Drumcliffe Bay to enter Sligo Town. A bypass of the entire route was planned, with dual carriageway for at least part of the route. A route had been selected for the project, with the new road to run closer to the mountains and the bay than the existing N15. However, the NRA didn't give funding for the road and the project was suspended The local radio station in the North-West, Ocean FM had a special report in 2017 on how the road in Sligo needs to be upgraded in the wake of 3 crashes on this stretch of road in less than a fortnight.\n\n\n"}

The incumbent Margaret Thatcher was opposed by the little-known 69-year-old backbencher MP Sir Anthony Meyer. It was the Conservative Party's first leadership election for nearly 15 years, when Thatcher had taken the party leadership.\n\nDuring 1989 the Conservative government led by Thatcher had run into difficulties. In June Labour won their first national electoral victory since 1974 in the elections to the European Parliament, beating the Conservatives. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, had resigned in October over Thatcher's determination to follow the advice of her advisers, specifically Sir Alan Walters. Opinion polls were also starting to show a widening Labour lead, which had opened up since the Community Charge (or \"poll tax\") was phased in the previous April; public anger at this community charge mounted over the subsequent months. Thatcher had long considered, as her husband Denis desired, to stand down in May 1989 after 10 years as Prime Minister. However, having won a 102-seat majority at the general election two years previously, and having led the party for 14 years without a hint of a leadership challenge, Thatcher opted to carry on for a full third term.\n\nAs a result, Thatcher faced mounting internal party criticism, which culminated in the decision of Meyer to offer a stalking horse candidacy for the party leadership.\n\nSir Anthony Meyer was critical of the recently introduced Community Charge (which was seen by many as the key factor in the government's declining popularity), Thatcher's leadership style and her Euroscepticism. She had now led the party for nearly 15 years and had been prime minister for over 10 of those years.\n\nThatcher's European views came under attack from other Conservatives during the campaign. On 3 December, two days before the ballot, the BBC broadcast a programme on Jacques Delors in which Thatcher's predecessor as Conservative leader, Edward Heath had labelled Thatcher as a \"narrow little nationalist\" who was \"unable to move with the whole movement of history in creating the greater Europe.\" Meanwhile European Commissioner and former member of her cabinet, Leon Brittan had said on television that membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism had benefited the countries which had joined it, which was seen as being at odds with Mrs Thatcher's own views.\n\n<section begin=\"Only ballot: 5 December 1989\"/>\n<section end=\"Only ballot: 5 December 1989\"/>\n\nThatcher, whose campaign was organised by former Cabinet minister, George Younger, won the contest overwhelmingly and said afterwards:\n\nHowever, a total of 60 Conservative MPs did not support Thatcher by either voting for Meyer, spoiling their ballot papers, or abstaining. Michael Heseltine was reported the next day as being believed to be one of the three MPs who did not vote, along with the absent Bob McCrindle who was seriously ill. Another ill MP, Alick Buchanan-Smith was also absent, but voted by proxy, reportedly for Meyer.\n\nAfter the ballot Meyer said:\n\nAccording to the next day's \"Glasgow Herald\" Heseltine's supporters predicted that unless the Prime Minister changed \"her style of leadership\", she would \"be on her way out next year\".\n\nWithin a year, as the Community Charge (poll tax) sparked riots, the economy slid towards recession, and the Labour lead in the opinion polls mounted into double digits, Thatcher resigned as party leader and Prime Minister after a further contest in November 1990.\n\n"}

The candy is popular in Europe and North America. \n\nThe sweet brand is named after the town of Werther in Westphalia, where the company was founded in 1903. From 1969, the sweet was marketed under the brand name Werthers Echte. The brand name Werther's Original was adopted in the 1990s for the international market. They are now manufactured nearby, in Halle (Westfalen).\n\nThe original \"Werther's Echte\" was a caramel hard candy. \nLater variants included chewy toffees, and a soft, waxy form which melts easily inside the mouth called \"butterscotch-melts.\" A variant with chocolate filling is also available, as well as three sugarless variants that use isomalt as a sugar substitute: the original butterscotch flavour, a butterscotch coffee swirl, and a butterscotch mint swirl. A product available in the United Kingdom is \"Werther's Chocolate,\" a dark and milk chocolate with butterscotch running through it, sold in the same packaging and wrappers as Werther's Originals. A variant available in Canada and the United States, \"Butterscotch Apple Filled,\" has a green-apple-flavored filling.\n\nWell-known TV advertisements in Germany and the United Kingdom from around 1991 featured an older man offering Werther's butterscotch to his grandson. The grandfather in the first UK adverts spoke with an American accent, but was later localised to Received Pronunciation. The actor Arnold Peters appeared in them. In the United States commercials, TV actor Robert Rockwell played the kind-hearted grandfather. \n\nOne British advertisement consisted of a montage of the grandfather and grandson bonding together (for example, pointing at animals out of train windows).

Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: \"It taught me that you come into this world as you leave it, on your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary.\" Before the burst tyre, they had been listening to \"How to Disappear Completely\" by Radiohead. Following this experience, whenever Cumberbatch hears the song it \"reminds [him] of a sense of reality [... and] a reason for hope\".\n\nHe subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness. Cumberbatch also follows a vegan diet.\n\nCumberbatch is married to English theatre and opera director Sophie Hunter. Their engagement was announced in the \"Forthcoming Marriages\" section of \"The Times\" on 5 November 2014, after a 17-year friendship.

It wasn't out of desire.\" LGBT group Stonewall released a statement praising Cumberbatch's comments, saying, \"Seeing someone in the public eye – especially somebody as influential as Benedict – talking positively around gay issues, is powerful for young lesbian, gay and bisexual people.

They built a castle which dominated the town, but it was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1843 and little trace of it now remains. It had a population of 914 in 2001.\n\nIn 1741, the first slave rebellion happened in Codrington.

{"id": "2276005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276005", "title": "Eidetic reduction", "text": "Eidetic reduction\n\nEidetic reduction is a technique in the study of essences in phenomenology whose goal is to identify the basic components of phenomena. Eidetic reduction requires that a phenomenologist examine the essence of a mental object, be it a simple mental act, or the unity of consciousness itself, with the intention of drawing out the absolutely necessary and invariable components that make the mental object what it is. This reduction is done with the intention of removing what is perceived, and leaving only what is required.\n\nOne can take for example Descartes's piece of wax (not as a mental object, but as a demonstration of the concept of reduction). It appears to be opaque, flat, hard, extended to certain dimensions in space. It has a certain feel, smell, taste. Most of these qualities can be negated as necessary to the piece of wax continuing to be a piece of wax; the smell, taste, texture, opacity. If heated, it will continue to be the same piece of wax, the same molecules. However, the taste may change, the smell may become more noticeable, the texture will obviously change, it will become clear if heated to the point of melting, etc. The only things that remain (its extension into space, chemical makeup, and mass) are the things that are required for the existence of that piece of wax. \n\nEidetic reduction is a form of imaginative variation by which one attempts to reduce a phenomenon into its necessary essences. This is done by theoretically changing different elements (while mentally observing whether or not the phenomenon changes) of a practical object to learn which characteristics are necessary for it to be it without being something else. If a characteristic is changed, and the object remains unchanged, the characteristic is unnecessary to the essence of the object, and vice versa.\n\nThe basic steps of an eidetic reduction are threefold: first, choose some specific example (e.g., Descartes' wax). Then, vary the example imaginatively. The third step involves figuring out that which cannot be eliminated while the example remains itself. That which cannot be eliminated is part of the example's essence.\n\nAs an instructive process, eidetic reduction might be viewed as processes of abstraction; the works of Whitehead and Russell in their \"Principia Mathematica\" could give one a taste of those processes, or even the simple contemplation of mathematics itself in use: \"How many ideas have you?\" and the respondent may claim, \"Just two.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2276006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276006", "title": "Lotus 107", "text": "Lotus 107\n\nThe Lotus 107 was a Formula One car used by Team Lotus. Designed for the 1992 Formula One season, and used throughout most of 1992, 1993 and part of 1994, it brought in a final, short-lived period of competitiveness for the team in Formula One.\n\nThe 107 is attributed to the design work of Chris Murphy and his design team. Murphy joined Lotus after Akira Akagi's arrest and the Leyton House team he owned was thrown into turmoil. Murphy had designed the 1991 car; the 107 looked very similar to his earlier design leading some to say that the new Lotus was simply a rebadged Leyton House. After several seasons spent perfecting the system, the 107 was fitted with active suspension, pioneered by Lotus ten years before.\n\nUnquestionably beautiful the 107 had smooth sweeping lines a world away from the long developed and antiquated Lotus 102D whose heritage can be traced to the 1990 Formula One Season. The installation of the Ford Cosworth HB V8 engines, of a similar - if older - specification to those being used by Benetton, was complete by the unveiling of the car at the 1992 San Marino Grand Prix.\n\nJohnny Herbert liked the car very much, saying it was sublime to drive and responsive to set up changes, but admitted it was not reliable.\n\nWith a top notch driving squad of Johnny Herbert and a future double F1 World Champion Mika Häkkinen, the Lotuses were able to bring in some good results: at several races the twin cars were able to run in formation on the tail of the leading pack, at least in the early parts of the races. Reliability was limited. Häkkinen provided Lotus' best showing for several years at the Hungarian Grand Prix where he diced for the final podium position with Gerhard Berger's McLaren. In Portugal he ran as high as second before having to pit for new tyres late in the race. A further potential podium place in Japan was also lost.\n\nThe car was developed over succeeding seasons into B and C variants, the latter with Mugen-Honda power in place of the Cosworth. As was standard practice at the time, the team employed the active suspension technology that they had introduced to F1 back in 1987 on later variants, but the budget was not enough to make it really work, and besides, it was now far from being a unique capability. According to Alex Zanardi's autobiography \"My Story\", the focus on this system was to the detriment of other aspects of the car.\n\nThe team's financial difficulties dragged it under at the end of 1994. The Lotus 109, the last Formula One car of the team, which ran in the latter part of 1994, was a further derivative of this design.\n\n"}

{"id": "2276024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276024", "title": "Golden Dragon massacre", "text": "Golden Dragon massacre\n\nThe Golden Dragon massacre () was a gang-related shooting attack that took place on September 4, 1977, inside the Golden Dragon Restaurant at 822 Washington Street in Chinatown, San Francisco, California. The five perpetrators, members of the Joe Boys, a Chinese youth gang, were attempting to kill leaders of the Wah Ching, a rival Chinatown gang. The attack left five people dead and 11 others injured, none of whom were gang members. The perpetrators were later convicted and sentenced in connection with the murders.\n\nThe incident was motivated by a longstanding feud between two rival Chinatown gangs, the Joe Boys (Chung Ching Yee) and Wah Ching, traced back to 1969, when the first victim was killed. The two gangs controlled different parts of San Francisco, with the Wah Ching in Chinatown and the Joe Boys in the Richmond and Sunset districts, and had been rivals since the Joe Boys splintered off from the Wah Ching in the late 1960s. The shooting at the Golden Dragon was an attempted assassination of Wah Ching leaders, and was a direct retaliation for the shootout with the Wah Ching in Chinatown's Ping Yuen (Peace Garden) housing project (Chinese: 平園住宅房屋大廈) on 4 July 1977 which was sparked by a dispute over fireworks sales. That shootout resulted in the death of 16-year-old Felix Huey (Chinese: 許非力; sometimes romanized as Huie) and the wounding of Melvin Yu, both members of the Joe Boys.\n\nHuey's murder, in turn, was seen as a reprisal for the earlier death of Kin Chuen Louie, a 20-year-old member of the Wah Ching who had been shot a dozen times on May 31 while attempting to escape in his car. Louie's death was later memorialized in a poem by Michael McClure, who came upon the victim shortly after the shooting. Including those victims in the Golden Dragon, 44 people had been murdered during the war between the Joe Boys and Wah Ching by 1977; Inspector John McKenna of the San Francisco Police counted 55 dead between 1969 and 1977.\n\nThe raid was planned in a Daly City apartment. Preparations began in early 1977, when Joe Boys members began acquiring the weapons that would be used in the massacre; during the summer of 1977, Tom Yu, a leader of the Joe Boys, convinced a longtime friend who owned a home in Pacifica to store the weapons, wrapped in cloth, in the front closet of that home. On August 29, 1977, Yu met with Carlos Jon, a member of another gang; Yu asked Jon to keep track of Wah Ching and allied Hop Sing Tong gang members over the upcoming Labor Day weekend, showing special interest in where they gathered late at night. The conspirators decided to target the Golden Dragon because it was a favorite hangout of both the Wah Ching and Hop Sing Tong. The planned raid would also financially damage Jack Lee, a Hop Sing elder who co-owned the restaurant.\n\nYu gave Jon the phone number of the Pacifica home and asked him to call on the following Saturday (September 3). That Friday night (September 2), members of the Joe Boys gathered in Pacifica, retrieved the weapons and put them on display. Yu received a phone call at 1:00 a.m. on Saturday morning, and after a brief, private conversation, ordered the weapons to be put back into the closet. By this time, the group plotting the shooting consisted of Tom Yu, his brothers (Chester and Dana), Melvin Yu (no relation), Peter Ng, Peter Cheung, Curtis Tam, Kam Lee, and Don Wong.\nLater that evening, the gang returned to Pacifica. Around 9:30 p.m., two members of the Joe Boys, Peter Cheung and Dana Yu were asked to steal a four-door car, which would facilitate entry and exit for a quick getaway; they returned shortly afterward with a blue Dodge Dart and parked it in the home's driveway. The gang members retrieved the guns from the closet after the homeowners returned and went to sleep. At 2:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time on Sunday, September 4, 1977, Tom Yu received a phone call from Carlos Jon that members of the rival Wah Ching gang, including Michael \"Hot Dog\" Louie, one of its leaders, were present at the Golden Dragon restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown (Chinese: 三藩市華埠金龍大酒樓).\n\nChester Yu drove a group of four Joe Boys (himself, Curtis Tam, Melvin Yu, and Peter Ng) to the Golden Dragon using the stolen Dodge. Forty minutes later, at 2:40 a.m., Chester Yu parked the stolen car near the Golden Dragon and stayed in the driver's seat while the others went to the restaurant. Armed with a .45-caliber Commando Mark III rifle (a modern clone of the Thompson submachine gun), two 12 gauge pump-action shotguns, and a .38-caliber revolver, the other three donned nylon stocking masks and entered the restaurant from the second entrance at 818 Washington, looking for members of the Wah Ching. During the trial of Curtis Tam, Chester Yu testified that Tam was wielding a shortened shotgun, Ng had a long-barreled shotgun and a handgun, and Melvin Yu was using the rifle. A crowd estimated between 50 to more than 100 people, many of whom were tourists, were present at the restaurant at the time of the shooting.\n\nAccording to Chester Yu, Ng had instructed Tam to fire a shot in the ceiling first so that \"when the people panic and get down on the floor, we will decide who to shoot.\" Instead, without warning, the three randomly opened fire on the patrons inside the crowded restaurant, killing five people, including two tourists, and wounding 11 others, none of whom were gang members. In Tam's confession, he stated he had been forced to join the shooting and deliberately did not target any patrons; after he \"heard Melvin start shooting, then Peter. I fired my first shot at the sofa. The second I aimed where nobody was.\" Testimony at Melvin Yu's trial showed he was the first to open fire, using the rifle.\nMelvin Yu walked directly up to a man at a table and shot him nine times, continuing to shoot after that victim had fallen to the floor. Melvin Yu then redirected his automatic rifle and shot randomly into the crowd, accompanied by two shotgun blasts from the other gunmen. The first victim, later identified as Paul Wada, a visiting law student, may have been misidentified as a gang sympathizer. An initial news report incorrectly identified some shooting victims as \"highly placed\" gang members. \n\nThe intended targets, the leadership of the Wah Ching and Hop Sing, were sitting at a table at the back of the restaurant. They were not injured in the shooting. Up to 10 members of the Wah Ching, including their leader, Michael Louie, ducked under tables during the gunfire. They had been alerted by a friend who spotted the three gunmen running toward the restaurant from a front-facing window and shouted \"Man with a gun!\" in Cantonese and English. Triad member Raymond Kwok Chow, then 17 years old and a member of the allied Hop Sing Tong, who would later achieve considerable notoriety, was among those who survived the attack.\n\nThe shooting lasted less than 60 seconds. Police later called it the worst mass murder in San Francisco history.\n\nComedians Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman of the Firesign Theatre were eating at the Golden Dragon during the shooting, after performing a Proctor and Bergman show at the Great American Music Hall. When Bergman, an Army veteran, realized the perpetrators had emptied their weapons, he rose from cover in time to see their faces as they exited. He later testified in their conviction.\nTwo off-duty armed police officers were also dining at the Golden Dragon during the attack. James Bonanno, a restaurant patrolman, dove for cover when the gunmen entered; he later testified that he pulled his revolver and radioed for help while hiding. Once the shooting stopped, after 30 to 45 seconds, he emerged and began to help the wounded diners. Richard Hargens (or Harkins) also fell to the floor after hearing shots and though he drew his revolver, he stated other people were in his line of fire and he was unable to shoot the gunmen. Neither officer was able to identify the gunmen beyond describing them as \"young Orientals\".\n\nChester Yu drove the shooters back to the house in Pacifica after the shooting, and the weapons were returned to the closet. After their return, the Joe Boys stayed awake until dawn discussing the shooting, then slept for a few hours before awakening to listen to the news of the killing. They dispatched Tony Chun-Ho Szeto, another Joe Boy, to pick up noodles from the Golden Dragon for breakfast. Later that morning, the perpetrators retrieved the weapons from the closet, cut them into pieces in the garage, and asked Szeto to dump the pieces into San Francisco Bay. Szeto drove Chester Yu to a location within sight of Kee Joon's, a Burlingame restaurant where Szeto worked, and together they dumped the parts into the Bay near San Francisco International Airport. A week after the shooting, Tom Yu called Carlos Jon for the last time, asking Jon to \"keep cool.\"\n\nThe five victims fatally shot at the restaurant were later identified as:\n\nOne week after the shooting, two Joe Boys were shot by suspected Wah Ching gunmen, leaving one dead and the other critically wounded, in what police called a revenge-motivated shooting. Michael Lee, 18, was killed and Lo \"Mark\" Chan, 19, was wounded critically during the ambush at the entryway of Chan's Richmond District home.\n\nChinatown, one of the leading tourist destinations in San Francisco, suffered after the shooting. Nighttime dining in Chinatown was depressed as restaurant reservations were cancelled en masse following the shooting. Although the Golden Dragon reopened just seven hours after the shooting, it closed as early as 10 P.M. in the week following a drop in patronage; normally it would stay open until 3 A.M. Business and tourist traffic remained depressed for several weeks following the shootings, although other businesses stated the rising cost of labor in Chinatown was to blame for increased prices and decreased patronage. By December, business at the Golden Dragon remained down and police had still not made any arrests, although by that time Michael Louie, the reported target that night, had been arrested for his suspected involvement with the 1976 murder of Kit Mun Louie (no relation), an 18-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) announced they were close to solving the crime soon after the shooting, but Chief Charles Gain criticized the Chinatown community for its silence and \"abdication of responsibility\" due to \"the subculture of fear\" of gang reprisals. SFPD Lieutenant Daniel Murphy, head of the investigation, said \"because so many innocent people were killed and injured, this time we have been getting more cooperation out of the residents and witnesses in Chinatown than we normally do.\" Chinatown residents came forward to provide tips in the days following the shooting, identifying that Wah Ching diners and Joe Boys assailants were present that night.\n\nChief Gain followed up his earlier criticism by calling gambling in Chinatown \"blatant, historic and rampant\". Gain later claimed his criticism of gambling in Chinatown was a gambit to anger the community and provoke them into providing more information. Gordon Lew, an editor of the local Chinatown newspaper \"East-West\", in turn criticized the SFPD for relying on information and cooperation from community leaders linked to the underworld, leading to community distrust of the SFPD, and concluded that \"committing suicide is not a virtue among the Chinese\". Joe Fong, founder of the Joe Boys, said in an interview from prison that SFPD officers had been paid to protect gambling operations in Chinatown, which Chief Gain disputed, saying that was part of the police culture prior to his ascension to chief.\n\nMayor George Moscone announced a reward for information leading to the conviction of the shooters two days after it occurred, the largest reward offered in San Francisco to date. The unprecedented reward was eventually increased to in late September, the highest reward allowed by city law. The SFPD received the first lead in the case two weeks after the shooting, pointing at Curtis Tam.\n\nHowever, by December 1977, no arrests had been made, though police were investigating the deadly rivalry between the Joe Boys and Wah Ching. The reward was eventually collected by Gan Wah \"Robert\" Woo of the Joe Boys. Woo had been arrested in March 1978 for participating in another gang skirmish on February 15 in Portsmouth Square, a shooting that left two Wah Ching members wounded. He gave the police a recording of Tam conversing about the massacre; subsequently, Woo was kept in protective custody after he had been identified as the informant.\n\nCurtis Tam, Melvin Yu, Peter Ng, Chester Yu, and Tom Yu were eventually arrested and convicted; after their arrests, the gunmen were identified as Ng, Melvin Yu, and Tam, all 17 years old at the time of the shooting.\n\nCurtis Tam was the first to be arrested on March 24, 1978. Tam, an emigrant from Hong Kong, was 18 years old and attending Galileo High School at the time of his arrest. A police informant recorded Tam recounting details of the attack, and shortly after his arrest, anonymous sources identified Tam as one of the gunmen, During his initial interrogation, Tam confessed and implicated 11 others. A hearing was held in April 1978 to determine if Tam should be tried as an adult, which was granted. The recording of Tam's interrogation was first played at an arraignment hearing in May 1978 and again at his trial; in it, he claimed \"They made me do it. If I didn't shoot somebody then they'd say, you know, I'm chicken. I don't think I shot anybody 'cause I didn't aim at anybody.\"\n\nIn early April 1978, the Yu brothers (Tom, Chester, and Dana) hired an attorney, George Walker, to make a plea bargain; in turn, their attorney met with the assigned assistant district attorney, Hugh Levine, on April 3 and explained his three unnamed clients were requesting immunity for two brothers (Tom and Dana Yu) in exchange for their testimony against the shooters. Walker described those two brothers as peripherally involved, specifically calling Tom Yu \"a peripheral figure who had inadvertently answered a telephone call at the house in Pacifica\" which had informed him that members of the Wah Ching and Hop Sing were at the Golden Dragon. The third brother, Chester, admitted to his role as the getaway driver, but requested for his proceedings to be held in juvenile court in exchange for his testimony. Levine tentatively agreed to allow the driver to enter juvenile court and provided immunity to the two brothers, conditioned upon confirmation that (1) they were only peripherally involved in the crime and (2) their testimony was truthful. Levine met Walker's three clients for the first time on April 19; Dana Yu's request for immunity was granted, and Chester Yu was allowed to enter the juvenile court system. However, since Levine already knew that Tom Yu, as a leader in the Joe Boys, could not have been involved only peripherally, immunity for Tom Yu was rejected.\n\nThe weapons used in the attack were recovered by police divers from San Francisco Bay on April 20, 1978 after Chester Yu showed them where they had been dumped. After Chester mentioned that a \"Carlos\" had called the house in Pacifica, Carlos Jon became a witness for the prosecution. At a preliminary hearing in May 1978, Tony Szeto described \"bungled efforts to dump a bagful of guns\". Ballistics tests matched the recovered weapons with bullets taken from those killed.\n\nOn April 21, the SFPD announced the arrests of Peter Ng and an unnamed juvenile (later identified as the driver of the getaway car, Chester Yu), and named Melvin Yu as another suspect they were seeking in connection with the massacre. Melvin Yu and Peter Cheung were arrested early on the morning of April 23, east of Carson City, Nevada. Tom Yu dropped George Walker as his attorney and surrendered to police after the Memorial Day weekend. In all, nine were arrested and scheduled to be tried for their roles in the massacre: Curtis Tam, Peter Ng, Tom Yu, Melvin Yu, Kam Lee, Chester Yu, Tony Szeto, Peter Cheung, and Donald Wong.\nBy August 1978, three youths who were charged with being accessories to the crimes had been found guilty or pleaded guilty in closed juvenile court proceedings.\n\nTam was scheduled to go on trial on July 31, 1978, but the trial was delayed while a change of venue was being contemplated. Tam's trial began on August 21, and he was convicted on five murder counts and eleven assault counts on September 5, 1978. Attorneys for the defendant made several motions to move the trial venue, sequester the jury, and ban reporters from the courtroom, none of which were granted. During his trial, Tam testified he had deliberately aimed his shotgun away from diners and only participated in the shooting under duress. However, Chester Yu testified that Tam was \"very happy\" after the shooting and recalled hearing Tam say he \"wanted to shoot more people\", and Tam was recorded by Robert Woo, threatening the life of a suspected police informant.\n\nThirteen eyewitnesses were called to testify at Tam's trial, including eight of the eleven wounded; none identified Curtis Tam as one of the gunmen, although the witness who initially spotted the trio running toward the restaurant identified Peter Ng from a police photograph. The prosecutors rested their case against Tam on August 29 after playing a recording of his confession, taken after his arrest on March 24. Attorneys made closing arguments on September 1, and after the Labor Day weekend, the jury reconvened on September 5; after deliberating for just over a day, the jury found Tam guilty of five counts of second degree murder, eleven counts of assault, and several weapons possession charges. Tam faced a sentence of up to 35 years imprisonment, but a defense attorney vowed to appeal the verdict, which he called \"a compromise\" because he thought \"[the jury] considered duress in reducing their finding of intent on Tam's part\". The sentencing hearing was set for October 3. Tam received a sentence of 28 years imprisonment. On June 18, 1981, the California Court of Appeals reduced his sentence to 23 years. Tam filed another appeal in August 1981.\n\nAfter Tam's trial, Tom Yu, Melvin Yu, and Peter Ng stood trial. On September 26, 1978, Melvin Yu was convicted after four hours of deliberation of five counts of first-degree murder and 11 counts of assault with a deadly weapon; his attorney offered no defense against the charges, and Melvin Yu did not testify at his trial. He received a life sentence.\n\nPeter Ng went on trial on January 8, 1979 in Fresno, and was convicted on February 22 of five counts of first degree murder and eleven counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Jurors deliberated four hours before reaching the verdict.\n\nTom Yu was indicted but moved to dismiss the charges on the basis that he had been granted immunity by Levine; the trial court denied the motion, finding both that he had not satisfied the two imposed conditions, and further, that his proposed testimony was not true. Yu then entered a conditional guilty plea in 1979 on one count of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder and admitted that a firearm was used in the crime. The plea bargain had been extended to Tom Yu on April 25, 1978, modified on May 30, and accepted by Yu on September 1. However, upon reviewing the probation report, which called Tom Yu \"the prime mover in the whole thing\", the court rejected the plea bargain and restored the original charges. Yu appealed the rejection of the plea bargain, since the court had previously ruled it was a binding agreement, although the presiding judge also added the condition that court judgment could be used to set it aside. The trial venue had been moved first to Fresno due to publicity in San Francisco, and then to Santa Barbara since Peter Ng had already been tried and convicted in Fresno. Yu's first trial ended in a hung jury in September 1979. He was later convicted of five counts of first degree murder, eleven counts of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, one count of conspiracy to commit murder, and one count of conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in state prison.\n\nIn October 1991, Curtis Tam was released from prison. Tam requested a Certificate of Rehabilitation and Pardon in September 2018; the request was denied in November.\n\nIn 2014, Melvin Yu was granted parole; during the parole hearing, he said that he had plans to live with a cousin in Hong Kong and expected to be deported back to there. As of 2017, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate of San Francisco stated that there was no record for deportation requests for Yu, and Yu had been living in San Francisco. Yu converted to Christianity approximately ten years after the shooting at the Golden Dragon, and served time at Deuel Vocational Institute, where he took college courses in mathematics.\n\nTom Yu was eligible for parole in 2017 and was released before September 2018.\n\nPeter Ng was eligible for parole in 2020, after being denied eight times, most recently in 2015. According to state records, he was no longer listed as an inmate in 2018.\n\nAn ex-Joe Boys member, Bill Lee, wrote about the killings and his gang experiences in \"Chinese Playground: A Memoir\". Lee left the gang shortly after the 1977 massacre. He filed a police report over an April 1999 incident, in which former peers said he should not have written the book during a public reading.\n\nThe Golden Dragon Massacre led to the establishment of the SFPD's Chinatown (later Asian) Gang Task Force, credited with ending gang-related violence in Chinatown by 1983. The Task Force's first credited arrest was for Michael Louie, the reputed 21-year-old leader of the Wah Ching who was one of the targets in the Golden Dragon Massacre.\n\nMichael Louie was arrested on December 5, 1977 for the murder of Kit Mun Louie (no relation). Kit Mun was an 18-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong (via Honolulu) who was shot and killed on August 29, 1976. The two had been romantically involved, but he confessed to being angry with her for \"whoring around with Joe Boys\". He claimed that to frighten her, he put an unloaded gun to her head as she was sleeping and pulled the trigger. Although he had removed the clip to unload it, the firing chamber was still loaded with a live round and he shot her at point-blank range. Afterward, he scattered pieces of the weapon in San Francisco Bay and dumped her body near Stinson Beach, where it was discovered on January 1, 1977, but not identified until November 1977. Michael Louie pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and possession of a deadly weapon after his arrest, receiving a sentence of 15 years imprisonment in January 1978; he was eligible for parole after four years.\n\nRobert Woo, the informant who collected the $100,000 reward, was killed during a shootout with police while robbing a jewelry shop in Los Angeles on December 19, 1984.\n\nThe Golden Dragon restaurant continued operation shortly after the massacre, but patronage was down and it failed a health inspection in September 1978. After failing another health inspection in January 2006 it was closed. The restaurant also owed a year's worth of paychecks to its employees. It was reopened in May 2006 as the Imperial Palace Restaurant.\n\n\n"}

Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 30 (US 30) in East Liverpool at the West Virginia state line on the Jennings Randolph Bridge over the Ohio River; its northern terminus is at SR 531 in Ashtabula. The route is concurrent with US 30 through East Liverpool and with Interstate 80 (I-80) near Youngstown. The first section of the route to be completed, from Canfield to Austintown, opened in 1969. The entire current route was complete in 1972, and upgraded to a divided highway by 1980.\n\nAll of SR 11 is included as a part of the National Highway System, a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highest traffic count is at I-80 near Austintown, where 38,360 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. The lowest traffic count is near US 6, where 5,550 vehicles travel the highway on average each day.\n\nSR 11 starts at Jennings Randolph Bridge, and becomes concurrent with US 30 and SR 39 as it turns southwest. The concurrency bends around East Liverpool, SR 39 leaves the concurrency, and SR 7 joins it. The route finally turns north and leaves East Liverpool. It turns northwest, near the southern terminus of SR 170. It intersects the concurrency termini of SR 7 and US 30 in these three miles. SR 11 travels through forests, passes by Lisbon, only connecting with SR 154 at an interchange. The highway travels north to near Leetonia, where it meets SR 344 at a diamond interchange. The forests slowly change into farmland, as it passes under SR 14 and into Mahoning County.\n\nIn Mahoning County, the route becomes part of the eastern city limits of Canfield, meeting US 224 at a parclo interchange. The highway crosses over the Ohio Turnpike, and becomes concurrent with I-80 few miles later. Here, most of the route is surrounded by urban areas. The interchange with I-80 and I-680 is incomplete, with ramps from I-680 west to I-80 east and I-80 west to I-680 east missing. I-80 and SR 11 travel northeast, leaves Mahoning County, and enters Trumbull County. SR 11 and I-80 split at the interchange at SR 711, east of Girard. This interchange is also incomplete, with ramps from I-80 east to SR 711 south and SR 711 to I-80 west missing.\n\nSR 11 continues north toward Ashtabula, meeting interchanges for SR 82 and an access road to the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. Urban areas transition back into rural areas here. It later intersects SR 305 and SR 5 at diamond interchanges near Cortland. The route then enters Ashtabula County, and travels in a straight line, passing through US 322, a rest area, US 6, and SR 307. Mostly forests and fields are between the highway. The route slowly bends northwest, and meets I-90 at a cloverleaf interchange. The route crosses over Ashtabula River, and bypasses Ashtabula. It ends at SR 531, part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour, at a stop sign.\n\nSR 11 was designated between 1967–1969 as a connector between Canfield and Austintown. Two years later, it was extended north to I-80, and south to SR 7, north of East Liverpool. A section from SR 531 to SR 307 was also completed. Those two sections were later connected. By 1972, all parts of the route were complete. SR 11 was upgraded to a limited access highway, from SR 82 to SR 307, between 1972 and 1981. In 2000, construction began for the King Graves Road interchange, which opened a year later. On October 24, 2005, the interchange at SR 711 and I-80/SR 11 opened, after it was modified to connect SR 711. The only rest area on SR 11 received turn lanes in 2011.\n\nSR 11 was designated as the \"Lake to River highway\" on September 28, 1973. The section in Ashtabula County was also designated as the \"Marine Private Henry Kalinowski Memorial Highway\" on April 7, 2009. Around 2002, the section in East Liverpool, starting from Newell Street, and ending at the state line, was designated as the \"Lou Holtz Highway\". \n\nThere have been three chemical spills on SR 11. The first one happened on November 30, 1984. A tanker truck leaked Titanium tetrachloride at the I-80/SR 11 interchange at Girard. About 200 residents who lived near the highway were evacuated. No injuries were reported, and the chemicals were soon contained. A spill was reported on July 7, 1996. A tanker truck spilled methyl alcohol onto SR 11 northbound, in Fairfield Township. The spill was contained, and charges were filed against the driver. The third and most recent one, happened on September 9, 2003. A tanker spilled of a flammable solvent between SR 344 and SR 154.

The island is located along Texas's southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is noted for its white sandy beaches. Meaning \"father\" in Spanish, it was named after Father José Nicolás Ballí (c.1770-1829), who owned the island and served as a missionary priest and collector of finances for all the churches in the Rio Grande Valley. He also founded the first mission in present-day Cameron County.\n\nPadre Island is the second-largest island by area in the contiguous United States, after Long Island in New York on the Atlantic Coast. It is about long and wide, stretching from the city of Corpus Christi, in the north, to the resort community of South Padre Island in the south. The island is oriented north-south, bordered by the Gulf of Mexico on the east and Laguna Madre on the west. The island's northern end connects to Mustang Island by roadway. The southern end of the island is separated from Brazos Island by the Brazos Santiago Pass.\n\nThe town of South Padre Island is located on its southern end, but the island as a whole is sparsely populated. The central part of the island is preserved in a natural wild state as Padre Island National Seashore and part of the lower island is protected as part of the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge. Since 1964, the island has been divided by the artificial Port Mansfield Channel. The terms \"North Padre Island\" and \"South Padre Island\" are often used to refer to the separated portions of the island. Padre Island is included within the jurisdictions of Cameron, Kenedy, Kleberg, Nueces, and Willacy counties in Texas.\n\nThe island was used and occupied seasonally by the Karankawa people at the time of European encounter. During Spanish rule, Father José Nicolás Ballí, also known as Padre Ballí, owned the island in the 19th century, when it was known as the \"Isla de Santiago\" land grant. Padre Island had been granted in 1759 to his Spanish colonist grandfather, Nicolás Ballí, by King Charles III of Spain. The younger Ballí's parents were both Spanish immigrants to Mexico and owned vast amounts of land by royal grants.\n\nJosé Nicolás Ballí served as a secular priest and missionary; he also managed large amounts of land where he ran a ranching operation. In 1804 he founded the first ethnic Mexican settlement on the island as the town of \"\"El Rancho Santa Cruz de Buena Vista\"\" (later known as Lost City). In 1827 after Mexico achieved independence, Father Ballí requested a clear title to the property of Padre Island. His mother Rosa María Hinojosa de Ballí had made a joint application with him for eleven leagues of the island, but when reapplication was required in 1800, she withdrew her name in favor of him.\n\nAfter Ballí died in 1829, the government granted title to the island to him posthumously, issued jointly in his name and that of his nephew Juan José Ballí. He had bequeathed half the island to his nephew, who had worked with him on his ranch.\n\nDuring World War II, United States scientists considered Padre Island as one of eight candidate sites for the first test of an atomic bomb but chose White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for the detonation, instead.\n\nGeologically speaking, Padre Island is a young island, having formed in just the last several thousand years. It is one of 300 barrier islands stretching from Maine to Mexico. These natural barrier islands act to protect the mainland from the direct onslaught of storms.\n\nPadre Island began forming as a submerged sand bar some 4500 years ago, as shown by radiocarbon dating of shells. Geologic speculation indicates the emerged island may be 1000 to 1500 years younger. Barrier island origins have been debated for many years by geologists, but it is agreed they are formed and modified by such factors as sediment type and supply, sea-level directional changes, current and wave strength and direction, and tide magnitude.\n\nIt is theorized that Padre Island formed from offshore shoals, with later growth aided by spit accretion. (A spit is a long, narrow tongue of sand extending from a mainland shoreline and formed by the shoreline drifting of sediments.) After a history of shifting, abandonment and reestablishment by storm breaches, many tidal inlets were slowly closed. Short islands were joined to form today's longer islands.\n\nPadre Island graphically illustrates the life and sequences of a barrier shoreline: accretionary or building phase, equilibrium or stability phase, and erosion or destructional state. The northern half of Padre Island's shoreline is in equilibrium; the southern half (and much of the remaining Texas coastline) is in an erosional stage. Wind, wave and current action continue to rework and shape the island. South Padre Island has been in a destructive phase for a long time, probably having retreated landward (along with the lagoon and mainland shoreline).\n\nAll of Padre Island will probably retreat landward through long-term erosion due to three causes: interruption and decrease in sediment supply, relative sea level rise, and tropical storm activity. Today, hurricane washovers and wind-carried sand deposited in Laguna Madre build Padre Island's landward side at the expense of Laguna Madre.\n\nFlocks of migratory birds arrive at the island during either early spring or fall and winter, with thousands of birds spending the winter there or migrating through the area. During the summer the most common birds are shore and marshbirds as well as some raptors and songbirds.\nThe most common birds on the Gulf beach during the year are the willet, sanderling, black skimmer, great blue heron, double-crested cormorant, cattle egret, grey plover, laughing gull, brown pelican, reddish egret, and five species of terns, including the least tern, Caspian tern, black tern, Sandwich tern, and royal tern. The two periodically appearing birds nesting on the park's shores are the least tern and piping plover.\n\nIn September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas wildlife officials found a record 128 Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, including 81 in the Padre Island National Seashore and 4 on nearby Mustang Island. Wildlife officials had released 10,594 Kemp's ridleys hatchlings along the Texas coast in 2007. The turtles are endangered due to getting caught in shrimpers' nets; they are widely hunted in Mexico as popular sources of boot material and food.\n\n\n"}

A woman named Xiangfei was sent to the prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay with the jian. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk who was to inherit of the holy bo staff, the Kali-Yuga. After their illegitimate oldest daughter, Xianglian, was taken from her parents on her second birthday, Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, their sworn brother, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again. Xiangfei, pregnant with another girl, secretly left the temple to become a member of the Ming Dynasty secret Imperial Guard, the Jinyiwei. Months later, she gave birth to her youngest daughter, Xianghua, but never revealed anything about the girl's father or his lineage to her. By this time, the temple had found that Xiuqiang had stolen the Krita-Yuga and he was exiled, but Xianglian was to remain there to be trained as an orphan. Xiuqiang eventually discovered Xiangfei's whereabouts, but the Chai family asked him to leave her alone. As time passed, Xianghua had learned to use the Krita-Yuga just as well as her mother, and Xiangfei died after her 11th birthday. Five years afterward, Xianghua herself became a member of the Imperial Guard.\n\nPrior to the events of \"Soulcalibur\", the Emperor became displeased with the search for the legendary \"Hero's Sword\" (really Soul Edge), so he sent members of his Guard to help the quest advance. The guards would travel undercover under the guise of a traveling opera troupe, with Xianghua to be the main attraction. As Xianghua prepares for her journey, she recalls her mother's dying words that she was born to complete an important task and cut a path through an uncertain future. With her mother's keepsake jian, Xianghua left on her own after cutting her hair short. On her journey, she encounters a Ling-Sheng Su member Kilik and a Ryūkyū pirate Maxi. Told of the sword's true evil nature by Kilik, she agrees to aid both of them in their quest to destroy it, not knowing that her long-lost older sister Xianglian had been accidentally killed by Kilik when he was consumed by a berserker-style rage. Together, they storm the evil-infested Ostrheinsburg Castle in Europe as Maxi stays behind and defeats Astaroth, disappearing soon after, while Kilik and Xianghua slay the demon hordes and reach Soul Edge. Kilik uses his Kali-Yuga to defeat Nightmare, but immediately afterward, Xianghua is pulled into an ethereal void to face Inferno. Her weapon unveils herself as the holy sword and Xianghua defeats Inferno after a fierce struggle. As the void started to collapse, she carries Kilik out of it, though her sword is left behind. A mysterious man awards her with an unnamed jian in return for the great deed she has done. Xianghua keeps her role in Soul Edge's destruction secret and never reports it, but is stripped of her rank and reassigned to a menial position for her failure to retrieve the \"Hero's Sword\".\n\nFour years later (the timeline of \"Soulcalibur II\", \"Soulcalibur III\" and \"Soulcalibur IV\"), news reach her that the Emperor destroyed and massacred Xiwei, the center of government in the Empire's western territory under the public justification of a revolt, believing that the fortress had been withholding Soul Edge from him. He asks Xianghua to investigate the ruins as her experience could be useful in locating the sword. Though she believed that she had destroyed Soul Edge, pieces of it are rumored to exist in this place and so Xianghua decides to find every fragment and destroy them. She left on a second journey alone, convinced that this was a burden she has to bear after she failed to destroy Soul Edge completely the first time. During her adventure, Xianghua is reunited with Kilik, who is attacked and gravely injured by Zasalamel. Xianghua takes him back to his home and, after leaving a letter for him, she departs seeking an old general whom Edge Master has arranged for her to meet. Training with the general, Xianghua's skills improve significantly but she is unable to shake off an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy due to her failure to help Kilik. On the general's sage advice, she then begins to train her mind to become more fluid and allow her heart to filter in both the good and the bad. After months of training, she feels that she was ready and bid farewell to the general, beginning her journey anew to fight by herself. While traveling west on the Silk Road, she reunites with Kilik. Together they travel to India to find Maxi, but he does not join them. Xianghua swears to destroy the Soul Edge properly and once and for all.\n\nA few years later, Xianghua again reunites and connects with Kilik, but he considers this the result of an unfortunate destiny, and eventually disappears. Returning to her homeland with a broken heart, Xianghua realizes she is pregnant. However, her grandfather and patriarch of the Chai house is furious at this, as Xianghua is the second generation of women from such a distinguished family to bear the child of an unknown man, and she is ordered to kill the child and marry into another family. Xianghua is rescued by the heir of the Yan family, Yan Wujin, who issues a condition for marrying Xianghua and not revealing the scandal, to allow the child, a boy named Xiba, to live (Xiba was then raised by Kong Xiuqiang). She later gave Wujin a daughter named Leixia (a \"Soulcalibur V\" character).\n\nA young Xianghua returns in the reboot game \"Soulcalibur VI\".\n\nIn the \"Soulcalibur\" manga adaptation, Xianghua meets Edge Master in the middle of her journey. Later, Xianghua and Li Long's sister Meimei are forced to fight through a Lizardmen invasion of an Indian town and Meimei is killed in battle. Xianghua is rescued by Kilik and Maxi in their first meeting, and her Krita-Yuga suddenly transforms into the Soul Calibur, destroying the Lizardmen.\n\nXianghua figurines have been released in Japan by several manufacturers, including Duck Tail, Epoch, Wave, and Yujin.\n\nDuring Xianghua's early design phase, several concepts were considered for her attire, before settling upon a light and oriental appearance for her. Additionally it was considered to have her appear as a young girl instead, or alternatively for her to fight unarmed using martial arts, an idea later put to effect through \"Tekken\" character Heihachi Mishima in his guest appearance in \"Soulcalibur II\". Xianghua would become more feminized in her clothing over the course of the series.\n\nXiānghuà means \"fragrant flower\" in Chinese if each character is taken literally. She is officially described as \"Flower in the Breeze\" and uses an elegant fighting style based on a nimble footwork.\n\nAs a tribute for the acclaimed \"Soulcalibur\" player Kayane, whose favourite character (and even a role model) was Xianghua, Namco created a tribute AI named \"Kayane\" in \"\", imitating her playing style. Xianghua's fighting style was eventually given to her teenage daughter Yan Leixia in \"Soulcalibur V\". (Comparing the two characters, Kayane opined that while Leixia seems unfinished, she displays some individual characteristics and is not merely \"a simple copy\" of Xianghua.)\n\nGameplay-wise, Xianghua is regarded as one of the better characters in \"Soulcalibur II\". \"GamePro\" guide to \"Soulcalibur II\" lists her strong points as having \"excellent speed and evasive characteristics\" and \"a solid 8-way run offensive\" even as she \"can often rely too heavily on specific moves.\" In Andrew Alfonso's GameSpy guide, she is described as a character \"that can win without too much effort. Xianghua is definitely not a hard character to learn, and a lot of her strengths come through poking and landing launchers for combos.\" Similarly, Eurogamer's Matt Edwards opined that Xianghua in this game \"trounces most of the competition thanks to her safe pressure and decent combos.\" BradyGames' official guide also noted that, unlike a fellow \"up-close fighter\" Talim, \"Xianghua can deal a nice bit of damage\" with her attacks. According to \"Hardcore Gamer\", while Xianghua in \"Soulcalibur IV\" \"is still unpredictable and juggle-happy, and does more damage than she used to—in exchange, she’s been given more recovery time on her moves (...) and her old juggle tactics are tougher to pull off.\"\n\nThe character has been mostly very well received by game critics and has been noted for her sex appeal. Both David Rakoff of \"The New York Times\" and Darek Pasturczak of Wirtualna Polska called her \"beautiful but deadly.\" \"Dreamcast Magazine\" ranked her as the seventh top \"girl on the Dreamcast\" in 2000, commenting: \"With an oriental flavour to her moves and style, Xianghua is a bit of a minx even though she looks sweet and innocent.\" GameSpy's Dave Kosak joked that a better translation of Xianghua's victory one-liner could be \"Don't you want to just lick me up and down like a popsicle?\" and GamesRadar's Shane Petterson described her official artwork for \"Soulcalibur IV\" as \"screwing you with her eyes.\" Arcade Sushi's John Llewellyn Martin called Xianghua one of the series' \"most beloved characters\" and Kotaku's Alex Jaffe listed her among \"the world's best fighting characters\".\n\nAccording to IGN's Jesse Schedeen \"Xianghua may be traditional in some ways, but she certainly doesn't dress like it. She has one of the more unique costumes in \"Soulcalibur IV\", a hodgepodge of different Oriental fashions that come together in one sexy look. Never before has a kung fu hero been such a babe.\" In 2014, Julia Cook of \"Paste\" ranked Xianghua as the second \"best dressed lady\" in all video games for her collection of varied \"tight outfits with flowy, feminine accoutrements\" from \"brightly colored capris under dresses or robes, sometimes with a sleek tiara\" in early games to \"a more masculine blazer and shorts combination for \"Soul Calibur IV\".\"\n\n\"GamePro\", on the other hand, criticized her looks that \"can't kill\" as compared to the designs of the other female characters of \"Soulcalibur II\". Some like GameSpy's Kosak as well as Crunchyroll's Nate Ming also expressed annoyance of Wendee Lee's \"barely-repressed Flatbush accent\" in the English voice track versions.\n\n\"Soulcalibur V\" was widely criticized for removing several fan-favourite classic characters, including Xianghua. Nevertheless, Thomas Nickel of Eurogamer Germany opined Leixia \"represents an equivalent replacement of Xianghua.\"\n\n"}

However, with the Union holding more weight as a single bloc, there are at times attempts to speak with one voice, notably on trade and energy matters. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy personifies this role.\n\nThe EU's foreign relations are dealt with either through the Common Foreign and Security Policy decided by the European Council, or the economic trade negotiations handled by the European Commission. The leading EU diplomat in both areas is the High Representative Josep Borrell. The Council can issue \"negotiating directives\" (not to be confused with directives, which are legal acts) to the Commission giving parameters for trade negotiations.\n\nA limited amount of defence co-operation takes place within the Common Security and Defence Policy. However, it is hoped that defence co-operation and integration between member states will be improved by establishing a Military Planning and Conduct Capabilities (MPCC)\" unit focused on military operations.\n\nThe High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the EU's predecessor, opened its first mission in London in 1955, three years after non-EU countries began to accredit their missions in Brussels to the Community. The US had been a fervent supporter of the ECSC's efforts from the beginning, and Secretary of State Dean Acheson sent Jean Monnet a dispatch in the name of President Truman confirming full US diplomatic recognition of the ECSC. A US ambassador to the ECSC was accredited soon thereafter, and he headed the second overseas mission to establish diplomatic relations with the Community institutions.\n\nThe number of delegates began to rise in the 1960s following the merging of the executive institutions of the three European Communities into a single Commission. Until recently some states had reservations accepting that EU delegations held the full status of a diplomatic mission. Article 20 of the Maastricht Treaty requires the Delegations and the Member States’ diplomatic missions to \"co-operate in ensuring that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council are complied with and implemented\".\n\nAs part of the process of establishment of the European External Action Service envisioned in the Lisbon Treaty, on 1 January 2010 all former \"European Commission delegations\" were renamed \"European Union delegations\" and till the end of the month 54 of the missions (marked with in the list of diplomatic missions) were transformed into embassy-type missions that employ greater powers than the regular delegations. These upgraded delegations have taken on the role previously carried out by the national embassies of the member state holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union and merged with the independent Council delegations around the world. Through this the EU delegations take on the role of co-ordinating national embassies and speaking for the EU as a whole, not just the Commission.\n\nThe first delegation to be upgraded was the one in Washington D.C., the new joint ambassador was Joao Vale de Almeida who outlined his new powers as speaking for both the Commission and Council presidents, and member states. He would be in charge where there was a common position but otherwise, on bilateral matters, he would not take over from national ambassadors. All delegations are expected to be converted by the end of 2010. Some states may choose to operate through the new EU delegations and close down some of their smaller national embassies, however France has indicated that it will maintain its own network around the world for now.\n\nThe EU sends its delegates generally only to the capitals of states outside the European Union and cities hosting multilateral bodies. The EU missions work separately from the work of the missions of its member states, however in some circumstances it may share resources and facilities. In Abuja is shares its premises with a number of member states. Additionally to the third-state delegations and offices the European Commission maintains representation in each of the member states.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the European External Action Service by the Treaty of Lisbon there were separate delegations of the Council of the European Union to the United Nations in New York, to the African Union and to Afghanistan - in addition to the European Commission delegations there. In the course of 2010 these would be transformed into integrated European Union delegations.\n\nThe EU member states have their own diplomatic missions, in addition to the common EU delegations. On the other hand, additionally to the third-state delegations and offices the European Commission maintains representation in each of the member states. Where the EU delegations have not taken on their full Lisbon Treaty responsibilities, the national embassy of the country holding the rotating EU presidency has the role of representing the CFSP while the EU (formerly the Commission) delegation speaks only for the Commission.\n\nMember state missions have certain responsibilities to national of fellow states. Consulates are obliged to support EU citizens of other states abroad if they do not have a consulate of their own state in the country. Also, if another EU state makes a request to help their citizens in an emergency then they are obliged to assist. An example would be evacuations where EU states help assist each other's citizens.\n\nNo EU member state has embassy in the countries of Bahamas, Bhutan (Denmark Liaison office), Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Liberia (EU delegation), Liechtenstein, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Samoa (EU office), Somalia, Swaziland (EU office), Tonga, Tuvalu, the sovereign entity Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the partially recognised countries Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Republic of China (Taiwan) (17 non-diplomatic offices). The European Commission also has no delegations or offices to most of them (exceptions mentioned in brackets).\n\nThe following countries host only a single Embassy of EU member state: Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK, EU delegation), Belize (UK, EU office), Central African Republic (France, EU delegation), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK, EU office), Guyana (UK, EU delegation), Lesotho (Ireland, EU delegation), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), São Tomé and Príncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal, EU delegation), Vanuatu (France, EU delegation). The European Commission also has no delegations or offices to most of them (exceptions mentioned in brackets).\n\nThe European Union regularly holds High-level Political and Security Dialogues (HLDs) with the countries of Central Asia which include Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, with Afghanistan often invited as a guest. The HLDs with these states have a focus on security, and provide a formal platform to exchange views and ideas, advance collaboration and support EU involvement in the Central Asian region.\n\nAn update to the 10 year old EU-Central Asia strategy is expected to be developed by the end of 2019. The new EU Central Asia Strategy was introduced at the EU-Central Asia Ministerial meeting in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, on July 7, 2019. Federica Mogherini also presented a set of EU funded regional programmes totaling €72 million. The new programmes cover the following sectors: sustainable energy, economic empowerment, education, and inclusive sustainable growth.\n\nThe EU launched in 2002 the BOMCA to mitigate the impacts of human trafficking, trafficking of drugs, organised crime and terrorism on EU interests and regional partners.\n\nThe CADAP works to bolster drug policies of Central Asian states by providing assistance policy makers, industry experts, law enforcement, educators and medical staff, victims of drug abuse, the media and the general public.\n\nhttp://cadap-eu.org/\n\nThe European Union's member-states retain close links with many of their former colonies and since the Treaty of Rome there has been a relationship between the Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries in the form of ACP-EU Development Cooperation including a joint parliamentary assembly.\n\nThe EU is also a leading provider of humanitarian aid, with over 20% of aid received in the ACP coming from the EU budget or from the European Development Fund (EDF).\n\nIn April 2007 the Commission offered ACP countries greater access to the EU market; tariff-free rice exports with duty- and quota-free sugar exports. However this offer is being fought by France who, along with other countries, wish to dilute the offer.\n\nThere are questions as to whether the special relationship between the ACP group and the European Union will be maintained after the coming to the end of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement Treaty in 2020. The ACP has begun looking into the future of the group and its relationship to the European Union. Independent think tanks such as the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) have also presented various scenarios for the future of the ACP group in itself and in relation to the European Union.\n\nThe European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) aims at bringing Europe and its neighbours closer.\n\nThe Union as a whole is increasingly representing its members in international organisations. Aside from EU-centric organisations (mentioned above) the EU, or the Community, is represented in a number of organisations: \n\nThe EU is also one of part of the Quartet on the Middle East, represented by the High Representative. At the UN, some officials see the EU moving towards a single seat on the UN Security Council.\n\nThe European Union is expected to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). In 2005, the leaders of the Council of Europe reiterated their desire for the EU to accede without delay to ensure consistent human rights protection across Europe. There are also concerns about consistency in case law - the European Court of Justice (the EU's supreme court) is already treating the Convention as though it was part of the EU's legal system to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the European Court of Human Rights (the court interpreting the Convention). Protocol No.14 of the Convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the Treaty of Lisbon contains a protocol binding the EU to joining. The EU would not be subordinate to the Council, but would be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states are currently. It is further proposed that the EU join as a member of the Council once it has attained its legal personality in the Treaty of Lisbon.\n\nWhere the EU itself isn't represented, or when it is only an observer, the EU treaties places certain duties on member states;\n\n\n\n\n"}

In recent times, Novalja has become famous because of the Zrće Beach.\n\nThe earliest settlers on the island were an Illyrian tribe that came to the region in the Bronze Age; traces of their settlement can still be seen around Pag. In the 1st century BC, the Romans took possession, and have left numerous archeological and cultural artifacts.\n\nNovalja is the successor of a Roman city called Cissa, considered by many scholars to be the seat of an ancient Christian bishopric of that name. Others prefer to identify the see with an island city of the same name in Istria, close to present-day Rovinj. A bishop of Cissa named Vindemius took part in some year between 571 and 577 in a schismatic synod in Grado called by Patriarch Elias of Aquileia. Arrested by the Exarch of Ravenna he was forced to abjure his views on the controversy of the Three Chapters, but once free from Byzantine Empire control reaffirmed his position and took part in another schismatic synod in 590. A bishop of Cissa called Ursinus took part in a synod at Rome in 680 and signed the acts. Soon after, Cissa ceased to exist, perhaps because of an earthquake. No longer a residential bishopric, Cissa is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nThe Croats arrived in the 7th century along with the great migration and settled in the area. The island was for some time under the rule of the Croatian kingdom. Yet the island was always fought over, and in the 11th and 12th centuries was divided between the communities of Rab and of Zadar. Novalja was given to the community and diocese of Rab by Croatian King Petar Krešimir IV. From the 12th to 14th centuries, Novalja, along with other Dalmatian towns and islands, was fiercely contested between the Republic of Venice and the Croatian-Hungarian rulers. For four centuries from the start of the 15th century it was held by Venice, until Venice lost its independence. Austria and France then fought over the Dalmatian area with victory going to the Austrians.\n\nThe island passed from Austria to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I, and then to the Independent State of Croatia (1941–1945). After the Second World War it returned to Yugoslavia and, when this broke up, it became part of the new state of Croatia. Unusually, the island is divided between two counties, with Novalja and Stara Novalja being part of the northern Lika-Senj County.\n\n\n"}

They lived in co-existence with other smaller ethnicities, having rivalries from time to time. \n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, under the rule of the Congo Free State, a government military station was created at Yei , where the road to the Nile crossed the Yei river. On taking over the Lado Enclave in 1910, the Anglo-Egyptian government immediately made Yei the centre of a campaign to fight sleeping sickness. In 1951, British missionaries built a small medical clinic on the northern bank of River Yei. \nBefore the onset of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983 - 2005), Yei was a thriving urban, commercial center. Due to its location, at the borders of Uganda and DRC, the city handled a lot of commerce between the three neighboring countries. At that time, it attracted visitors, from as far away as Juba, about , by road, to the north of Yei. Civil servants and other Juba residents would flock to Yei on weekends to participate in the exchange of goods and services offered in the many bars, shops and hotels. Yei became known as Small London because of its cosmopolitan nature.\n\nIn course of the civil war, the area around Yei became the center of two Ugandan rebel movements that were supported by the Sudanese government, namely the WNBF and UNRF (II). Both waged an insurgency in Uganda, but also fought alongside the Sudanese government against the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) rebels. The SPLA eventually launched a major offensive (codenamed Operation \"Thunderbolt\") against Yei in early 1997, effectively destroying the WNBF and UNRF (II) and capturing Yei itself in January 7th 1997. The town remained under SPLA control until the end of the civil war. Following its capture in 1997, the SPLA fortified and turned Yei into a garrison town.\n\nThe presence of large numbers of SPLA in town attracted air raids and shelling from the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). The population fled and the SPLA brought in more troops, who started families and started to grow the population of the city again. As the city became safer, later during the civil war, South Sudanese displaced from other parts of the country, particularly from the Bahr el Ghazal Region, began flocking to Yei for safety, and later for humanitarian assistance (food, medicine and housing).\n\nFollowing the cessation of major hostilities and the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, South Sudanese who had fled to Uganda and DRC began to return, and many chose Yei as their entry point. Due to the relative safety in the city, and the ready availability of International humanitarian aid, many of the returnees from other South Sudanese states chose to stay in Yei, instead of proceeding to their respective states of origin. This has created tension between the returnees who are native to Yei on one hand, and the IDPs who are native to other areas in South Sudan on the other. Local authorities and international aid partners are still grappling with finding acceptable, equitable and permanent solutions to the land claims and counter-claims and the resulting wrangles. And more returnees were coming in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Yei has reportedly been depopulated as a result of conflict during the South Sudanese Civil War.\n\n, the exact population of Yei was not known. Sources have come up with different estimates of the city's population over the past 30 years, including the following:\n\nThe table below summarizes the population estimates, including the sources for each set of figures:\n\nYei County is traditionally inhabited by many ethnicities including the Kakwa, the Bari, the Pojolu, the Baka, the Mundu, and the Avukaya.\n\nThe city is home to the Yei Agricultural and Mechanical University,\nYei Day Senior Secondary School.\n\nThe area around Yei receives adequate rainfall year-round, which allows for the cultivation of food and cash crops as well as the raising of domestic livestock. Coffee and cassava are some of the crops grown locally. Lush farmlands cover the landscape on the city outskirts. Four commercial banks maintain branches in the city: Equity Bank (South Sudan), Ivory Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank (South Sudan) and Eden Commercial Bank \n\nThe road network to neighboring cities and towns is actively undergoing repairs. For example, the road between Yei and Kaya, on the Ugandan border, has been repaired. It was financed by HABITAT and WFP. With the improvements the travel time to Kaya was reduced from five hours to one. Yei is also served by Yei Airport. The civil war decimated the city's infrastructure. However, with the cessation of hostilities in 2005 and the attainment of independence by South Sudan in July 2011, the prospects of Yei recapturing its former days of Small London look good indeed.\n\n\n"}

Where relevant, the Metropolitan bishop or Primate (bishop) is listed first. As in other Christian denominations, many Lutheran Metropolitan and Primate bishops bear the title \"Archbishop\".\n\nThis list does not contain historical or defunct dioceses, although links are provided (at the end of the list) to former Lutheran dioceses of particular historical note.\n\nThis list is solely for dioceses of those Lutheran churches which have retained, or established, episcopal polity. There are also many Lutheran churches with congregational polity, which do not have bishops, or who use the title bishop for their presiding officer, but in a sense other than that of the historic episcopate.\n\nAn established state church in Denmark and Greenland. The Bishop of Copenhagen is the Primate (Primus inter pares), but not a Metropolitan, having no actual jurisdiction superior to that of any other diocesan bishop.\n\nThe Archbishop holds authority throughout Estonia, assisted by Bishops of regional dioceses, including the Extra-Estonian Diocese, which had been a separate church until 2010. The College of Bishops is usually larger, due to the practice of giving most retiring Bishops the status of \"Bishop Emeritus\" (or \"Archbishop Emeritus\").\n\nFormerly a diocese of the Church of Denmark, it is now an autonomous church consisting of a single diocese.\n\nOne of two state sanctioned national churches in Finland. The Archbishop of Turku is the Primate. In addition to the dioceses listed below there is also a \"Military Bishopric\", although the Ordinary is not required to be in Bishop's Orders, and may be a senior priest.\n\nA small group of former members of ELCF have formed an independent conservative mission diocese, the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland. It is headed by its own bishop, but is not recognised by the ELCF, the Finnish Government, or the Lutheran World Federation.\n\nAn autonomous church structured as a single diocese.\n\nThe church is led by a Presiding Bishop, who is elected from amongst the diocesan bishops, and remains a diocesan bishop in addition to his role as Primate.\n\nSince 1801 the Church of Iceland has been united as a single diocese. Since that year, the Bishops of Skálholt and Hólar have been suffragans to the Bishop of Iceland. They retain their respective cathedras (seats) in Skálholt Cathedral and Hólar Cathedral. The Bishop of Iceland's cathedra is located in Reykjavík Cathedral.\n\nThe Council of Bishops (of which all Latvian bishops and archbishops are members) is the highest authority in the church; the archbishop is Primate and is sometimes styled \"Archbishop of Riga and Latvia\".\n\nAn autonomous church formed as a single diocese, and operating worldwide.

The Preses (Presiding Bishop) is the primate and metropolitan and also has Ordinary jurisdiction over the cathedral deanery in Nidaros (Trondheim), notwithstanding the existence of a Diocesan Bishop of Nidaros (see below).\n\nThe Primate is styled \"Bishop of the Church\" and is based in Warsaw.\n\nWith its origins in several separate denominations within the former Soviet Union, this has been a united church since 1999. The Primate is based in St Petersburg.\n\nA single-diocese church. Unlike ELCROS (above) the ELCI does not ordain women.\n\nThe largest Lutheran church in Europe. The Archbishop of Uppsala is the primate and metropolitan; although also the Ordinary (diocesan bishop) of Uppsala, much of this work is legally delegated to the Bishop of Uppsala, a suffragan bishop who functions as the effective diocesan bishop. There are 13 dioceses (listed below). Additionally the Church of Sweden Abroad forms a 14th jurisdiction, consisting of 45 churches, in 3 deaneries, all outside Sweden; it is under the episcopal oversight of the Bishop of Visby.\n\nVELKD, established in 1948. All member churches are also members of the all-Protestant umbrella EKD. Only Lutheran member churches are listed below.\n\n\nEstablished in 2012 from unions of several older denominations, and also part of the VELKD, but consisting of multiple internal dioceses. The State Bishop or Presiding Bishop is in overall charge. There are currently two Bishops of Mecklenburg and Pomerania (located respectively at Greifswald and Schwerin), but this is a temporary arrangement following mergers of denominations.\n\n\nThe Presiding Bishop (or State Bishop) is in overall charge, with the diocese divided into regions, which function as small dioceses.\n\nA group of Indian bishoprics with very different origins and founders, which retain their autonomy, but have united into a single denomination.\n\nA single-diocese church operating in Jordan, Israel, and Palestine.\n\nA single-diocese church operating in Malaysia. The Bishop's seat is located at Zion Cathedral, Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe ELCA does not have dioceses is the usual sense. However, its \"synods\" increasingly closely resemble a diocese in all but name, particularly since the decision in 2000 to appoint all new bishops within the historic apostolic succession, with the laying-on of hands by at least three current bishops.\n\nRegion 1:\nRegion 2:\nRegion 3:\nRegion 4:\nRegion 5:\nRegion 6:\nRegion 7:\nRegion 8:\nRegion 9:\n\n\n\nThe Archbishop is the primate, and is also responsible for a small diocese, comprising his cathedral in Nairobi and its immediate surrounding precincts.\n\nNamibia's three Lutheran denominations have a long history of co-operation together, and in 2007 formed the United Church Council as a parent body, within which they are working towards full visible unity as a single church.\n\n\"Working predominantly in the north of the country.\"\n\n\"Working predominantly in the south of the country.\"\n\n\"Working nationwide amongst the German-speaking community.\"\n\nThe Archbishop is not part of a formally constituted diocese, although he holds jurisdiction over a national arch-cathedral in Numan, which is also the location of the church's administrative headquarters.\n\nThe largest Lutheran church in southern Africa is headed by a Presiding Bishop.

They are nomadic agriculturists. The Lango live in the Ikwoto County area of Imatong State. This region borders Uganda to the South and their inhabitants are sharing ancestral lines with the Lango of Uganda.\n\nThe Lango comprises six dialect speaking groups, including the Ketebo people, Lokwa/logire people, Logir people, Dongotono people, Imotong people and Lorwama people. Lorwama originated from the Okol hills and Lolim mountain regions of northern Uganda, or from the Acholi people of Uganda and South Sudan.\n\nThe Lorwama tribe's language (Okolye or okolie) is spoken mainly by Lorwama natives, though it was adopted by the Ketebo people in the 1940s when their language vanished. The Ketebo people are now integrated into the Lorwama community, though they speak a slight variant of okolie. The Dongotono Lango dialect speaking group also speak Okolie, importing some words from the otuho language of the Lotuko people.\nIt is good to note that the Name Lorwama came as a result of treaty done probably in 1920s between the today called people Ketebo which means people who can eat meat with hard mixed porridge called Taffa. The original name for the tribe is OKOL people. So in many case as the people are getting into self evolutions, it always became an issue to deal with when it comes to who is a Lango? Is the name lango referring to the Lorwama, Lango or it is a name that unite the SIX groups? Instead of following the politicized individuals who think by dividing these six united people can give them more room for power, I suggest that any reader here should go back and know when in history were these people called Lango and who named them? Uganda is just another short place to trace from, but Kenya is the origin as many elderly people can witness.\n\nThe name \"\"Lango\"\" can also be spelled as \"Langgo\" or \"Langoni\" when referring to a male, or as \"Langoni\" for a female.\n\n"}

Born in Des Moines, Iowa, he is best known as one of two original guitarists in Slipknot. Steele co-founded Slipknot in 1995, performing on the band's debut demo \"Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.\". He left in 1996 and was replaced by Craig \"133\" Jones, but later rejoined in 2011 as the touring bassist following the 2010 death of Paul Gray. Steele was part of the recording sessions for the band's 2014 album \"\", but left at some point before the album was finished and was replaced by Alessandro Venturella. According to Jim Root, some of Steele's bass tracks were used for the album though he did not specify which tracks feature Steele on bass.\n\nDonnie Steele began his career as a member of Des Moines, Iowa-based death metal band Body Pit, in which fellow future Slipknot members Anders Colsefni (vocals), Mick Thomson (guitar) and Paul Gray (bass) had all performed. He later co-founded Slipknot in September 1995, alongside Colsefni, second guitarist Josh \"Gnar\" Brainard, Gray, drummer Joey Jordison and percussionist Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan. He was described by Brainard as \"a pretty technical guitar player\" and \"one of those multi-talented guys\". Author Joel McIver partly credits Steele with the introduction of jazz elements to the band's sound, describing the guitarist as a \"self-confessed jazzbo\".\n\nIn early 1996, after the recording of the band's debut demo \"Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.\", Steele began to miss a number of Slipknot rehearsal sessions. The other band members attempted to track the guitarist down, but had to continue on without him, until one of them later saw him by chance and was told that he no longer wanted to be in the group. According to Brainard, Steele \"felt that playing with Slipknot was against his Christian beliefs\"; the rest of the band respected the guitarist's reasons for choosing to leave, although both Brainard and Colsefni have criticised his lack of communication regarding his decision to do so. With concerts forthcoming, Steele was quickly replaced by Craig Jones.\n\nFollowing the death of Gray in May 2010, Slipknot took a brief hiatus and later announced that Steele would replace the bassist for upcoming tour dates. In an official statement, the band explained that \"Donnie was in the band at the very beginning, and rather than get an outsider, we thought it would be a fitting tribute to Paul to play with someone from within the family\". Speaking about his return to the band, percussionist Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan explained that the decision to invite Steele to replace Gray \"felt completely comfortable\", adding that the band was \"not gonna have some jackass from another band come into our world ... Donnie's family. Donnie's from the stone of the 'Knot\".\n\nDuring live performances, Steele remained backstage out of sight of the crowd. Despite praising him for fitting back into Slipknot well, Crahan justified this decision by asking \"What gives him the right to be onstage with us right now?\", elaborating that \"When we're going through an experience like this with our fans, they need to concentrate on the eight members that are grieving, not on someone new\".

In an interview with MFKR1, a website dedicated to the early incarnations of Slipknot, he described the band as \"a mixture of death metal, 80's thrash and shred with a strong emphasis on hooks\".

Since its launch was unsuccessful, it was not acknowledged in the Soviet press at the time.\n\n"}

{"id": "2276180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276180", "title": "Moroccan Quarter", "text": "Moroccan Quarter\n\nThe Moroccan Quarter or Mughrabi Quarter ( \"Hārat al-Maghāriba\", , \"Sh'khunat HaMughrabim\") was a 770-year-old neighborhood in the southeast corner of the Old City of Jerusalem, bordering on the western wall of the Temple Mount on the east, the Old City walls on the south (including the Dung Gate) and the Jewish Quarter to the west. It was an extension of the Muslim Quarter to the north, and was founded as an endowed Islamic waqf or religious property by a son of Saladin in the late 12th century.\n\nThe quarter was razed by Israeli forces, at the behest of Teddy Kollek, the mayor of West Jerusalem, three days after the Six-Day War in order to broaden the narrow alley leading to the Western Wall and prepare it for public access by Jews seeking to pray there. It is now the site of the Western Wall Plaza.\n\nAccording to the 15th-century historian Mujir ad-Dīn, soon after the Arabs had wrested back Jerusalem from the Crusaders the quarter was established in 1193 by Saladin's son al-Malik al-Afḍal Nurud-Dīn 'Ali, as a \"waqf\" (a mortmain consisting of a charitable trust) dedicated to all Moroccan immigrants. The boundaries of this \"ḥārat\" or quarter, according to a later document, were the outer wall of the Haram al-Sharif to the east; south to the public thoroughfare leading to the Siloan spring; west as far as the residence of the qadi of Jerusalem, Shams al-Din; the northern limit ran to the \"Arcades of Umm al-Banat\", otherwise known as the Qanṭarat Umam al-Banāt/Wilson's Arch causeway. It was set aside for \"the benefit of all the community of the Moroccans of all description and different occupations, male and female, old and young, the low and the high, to settle on it in its residences and to benefit from its uses according to their different needs.\" Soon after, Jews, many also from North Africa, were also allowed to settle in the city. By 1303, Moroccans were well established there, a fact attested by the endowment of a \"Zāwiyah\", or religious institution such as a monastery, made by 'Umar Ibn Abdullah Ibn 'Abdun-Nabi al-Maṣmūdi al-Mujarrad for this quarter.\n\nAl-Afḍal's waqf was not only religious and charitable in its aims, but also provided for the establishment of a madrassa law school school there, thereafter called eponymously the \"Afḍaliyyah\", for the benefit of the Malikite Islamic jurists (\"fuqaha\") in the city. A distinguished scion of a Spanish Sufi family of mystics, Abū Madyan, settled in Jerusalem in the early 14th century, and made another major endowment, of a \"Zāwiyah\" near the Bāb al-Silsilah, or Chain Gate, of the Haram, for the Moroccans in 1320. This consisted in a waqf property at 'Ain Kārim and another at Qanṭarat Umam al-Banāt at the Gate of the Chain, -the latter as a hospice exclusively for newly arrived immigrants- the usufruct (\"manfa'ah\") of both to be set aside in perpetuity for the Moroccans in Jerusalem. The Qanṭarat Umam al-Banāt endowment consisted of a hall, two apartments, a yard, private conveniences, and, below, a store and a cave (\"qabw\"). Attached to the document was a stipulation that the properties be placed, after the donor's death, under the care of an administrator (\"mutawalli\") and supervisor (\"nāzir\") selected on the basis of the community's recognition of his outstanding qualities of piety and wisdom. The Ain Karim properties alone were extensive, 15,000 dunams, and covered most of the village.\n\nSome time in the early 1350s, a third \"waqf\" was instituted by the Marinid Dynasty Moroccan King 'Ali Ibn 'Uthmān Ibn Ya'qūb Ibn 'Abdul-Ḥaqq al-Marini. This consisted of a codex of the Qur'an copied by his own hand Further endowments to the quarter took place in 1595 and 1630.\n\nUntil the advent of Muslims in Jerusalem, most of the area below the Western Wall was crammed with rubble, and Jewish prayer throughout the Islamic period appears to have been performed inside synagogues in the Jewish Quarter, or, on public occasions, on the Mount of Olives. The narrow space dividing the Western Wall from the houses of the Moroccan Quarter was created at the behest of Suleiman the Magnificent in the sixteenth century in order to allow prayers to be said there.\n\nThe Ottoman taxation registers listed 13 households in the quarter in 1525–26, 69 households, 1 bachelor and 1 imam in 1538–39, 84 households and 11 bachelors in 1553–34, 130 households and 2 bachelors in 1562–63, and 126 households and 7 bachelors in 1596–97. Originally developed for Moroccans, over the centuries Jewish, Christian and Muslim people from Palestine and elsewhere had at various times taken up residence there. By the time Israel decided to demolish their houses, roughly half of the zone's inhabitants could trace their origins back to Moroccan immigrants.\n\nAccording to the French traveler Chateaubriand who visited in 1806, some of the residents of the quarter were descended from Moors who had been expelled from Spain in the late 15th century. They had been well received by the local community and a mosque had been built for them. Residents of the neighborhood held on to their culture in the way of food, clothing and traditions until it became assimilated with the rest of the Old City in the 19th century. Thus it also became a natural place of stay to Moroccans who came on pilgrimage to the al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nOver the years a small number of schools and mosques were established in the quarter and Muslim clerics who performed religious duties at the al-Aqsa Mosque lived there.\n\nThe site of Jewish prayer and lamentation was a stretch of some 30 metres along the wall, accessed via a narrow passage from King David's Street. In depth from the wall the paved area extended 11 feet. At the southern end lay one of the two \"zāwiyyah\" dedicated there in medieval times and the lane to the Wailing Wall sector ended in a blind alley closed off by the houses of the Moroccan beneficiaries. In 1840 a proposal by a British Jew, the first attempt to change the \"status quo,\" was conveyed via the British consul, and requested that Jews be allowed to repave the 120 sq. metre area. The plan was rejected both by the Abu Madyan \"waqf\" administrator and by Muhammad Ali Pasha. Moslems in the area also complained of the excessive noise, as opposed to past practice, caused by recent Jewish pilgrims. Jews at prayer were asked to continue their traditional practices quietly, and to refrain from proclaiming on doctrinal matters there.\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century Jewish worshippers were rare, and according to Yehoshua Ben Arieh, lacked any special distinction. In an account of his travels to the Holy Land in 1845, T. Tobler noted the existence of a mosque in the Moroccan quarter.\n\nAccording to Yeohoshua Ben-Arieh, the Moroccans regarded the Jews as infidels. They were subjected to harassment and were required to pay a sum in exchange for the right to pray there undisturbed. Increased friction at the site between Jews and Muslims arose with the onset of Zionism and the resulting fear among the Muslims that the Jews would claim the entire Temple Mount. Attempts were made at various times, by Moses Montefiore and Baron Rothschild to buy the whole area, without success. In 1887 Rothschild's bid to purchase the Quarter came with a project to rebuild it as \"a merit and honor to the Jewish People\" relocating the inhabitants in better accommodation elsewhere. The Ottoman authorities appeared to be ready to give their approval. According to some sources, the highest secular and Muslim religious authorities in Jerusalem, such as the \"Mutasarrıf\" or Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Şerif Mehmed Rauf Paşa, and the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Tahir Husseini, actually gave their approval. The plan foundered on Jewish, rather than Muslim objections was shelved after the chief rabbinical Haham of the Jerusalemite Sephardi community stated that he had had a \"providential intimation\" that, were the sale to go through, a terrible massacre of Jews would ensue. His opinion might have reflected a Sephardi fear that the Ashkenazis would thereby take possession of the holiest site in Judaism.\n\nIn the first two months after the Ottoman Empire's entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the quarter to Jews, requesting a sum of £20,000 which, he said, would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds.\n\nA hospice, the \"Dar al-Magharibah\", existed in the quarter to extend lodgings for Moroccan Muslims on pilgrimage to the Islamic sites of Jerusalem.\n\nIn April 1918, Chaim Weizmann, then a prominent Zionist leader on a visit to Jerusalem, sent a letter via Ronald Storrs offering the sheikhs £70,000 in exchange for the Wall and the buildings of the Moroccan quarter. This was immediately rejected when the Muslim authorities got wind of the proposal. Nothing daunted, Weizmann then addressed his petition to Arthur Balfour, asking him to resolve the issue by ruling in favour of the Jews. In a letter of 30 May that year, headed \"THE HANDING OVER OF THE WAILING WALL TO THE JEWS\", he gave his reasons as follows:\nWe Jews have many holy places in Palestine, but the Wailing Wall-believed to be part of the old Temple Wall-is the only one which is in some sense left to us. All the others are in the hands of Christians or Moslems. And even the Wailing Wall is not really ours. It is surrounded by a group of miserable, dirty cottages and derelict buildings, which make the whole place from the hygienic point of view a positive danger, and from the sentimental point of view a source of constant humiliation to the Jews of the world. Our most sacred monument, in our most sacred city, is in the hands of some doubtful Moghreb religious community, which keeps these cottages as a source of income. We are willing to compensate this community very liberally, but we should like the place to be cleaned up; we should like to give it a dignified and respectable appearance.'\n\nThe wall as well as the Moroccan Quarter nonetheless, throughout the British Mandatory period, remained Waqf property, while Jews retained their longstanding right to visit it. During the 1929 Palestine riots Jews and Muslims did however clash over competing claims on the area adjacent to the Moroccan Quarter, with Jews denying they had no aims regarding the Haram al-Sharif but demanding the British authorities expropriate and raze the Moroccan quarter. Jewish Moroccan and Muslim Moroccan pilgrims, both groups on a visit to Jerusalem, were present at the riots, and several of the former were killed or injured. Great Britain appointed a commission under the approval of the League of Nations to settle the issue. The Commission again reaffirmed the status quo, while placing certain restrictions on activities, including forbidding Jews from conducting the Yom Kippur prayers (the holiest holiday in Judaism), which involved the blowing of the Shofar, and Muslims from carrying out the Dhikr (Islamic prayers) close to the wall or to cause annoyance to the Jews.\n\nWhen Jordanian forces emerged as the victors in the battle for possession of the Old City in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, 1,500 Jewish residents, coinciding with the flight or expulsion of 70,000 Palestinians from Israeli-occupied areas of Jerusalem, were expelled from the Jewish Quarter, which was in the vicinity of the Moroccan zone.\n\nDisputes were not infrequent between the quarter's inhabitants and Palestinian landlords, squabbling over property rights. In 1965, Palestinian squatters in Jewish properties on the edge of the Moroccan Quarter were evicted by the Jordanian government and resettled in the Shu'afat refugee camp, four kilometers north of the Old City. The motives behind this ejection are unknown.\n\nThe razing of the quarter took place without any official authorization. Credit for demolishing the Moroccan Quarter is contested between several figures: Teddy Kollek, Moshe Dayan, Colonel Shlomo Lahat, Uzi Narkiss and David Ben-Gurion. The precise details of how the operation was carried out are not clear, since no paper trail was left by the participants. According to one source, the retired Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion played a pivotal role in the decision to demolish the quarter. He visited the Wall on 8 June, with Teddy Kollek, Shimon Peres and Ya'akov Yannai, head of the National Parks Authority at the time Ben-Gurion was upset at sighting a sign in Arabic on 9 June, the day after the Old City had been captured and protested at the presence of a sign in Arabic.\nHe noticed a tile sign in front of the Wall, which read \"Al-Burak Road\" in English and Arabic but not in Hebrew. It was a reminder of the prophet Mohammad's legendary horse, Buraq, left tethered by the Wall as the prophet took his journey to heaven from the famous rock above. Ben-Gurion looked at the sign with disapproval and asked if anyone had a hammer. A soldier tried to pry off the tile with a bayonet, but Ben-Gurion was concerned about damage to the stone. An axe was produced and the name on the tile carefully removed. The symbolism of expunging Arabic from the redeemed Jewish holy site was not lost on the surrounding crowd, or on Ben-Gurion. They cheered, and Ben-Gurion exclaimed, \"This is the greatest moment of my life since I came to Israel.\"\n\nBen-Gurion also proposed the following day that the walls of the Old City be demolished since they weren't Jewish, but the government did not take up the idea. Teddy Kollek in his memoirs wrote that it was necessary to knock down the quarter because a pilgrimage to the wall was being organized with hundreds of thousands of Jews, and their passage through the \"dangerous narrow alleys\" of the \"slum hovels\" was unthinkable: they needed a clear bright space to celebrate their return to the site after 19 years. To that end, archaeologists and planners had examined the area the day before to map out what had to be demolished. The operations had a larger scope, not only to clear the Mughrabi quarter, but also expel all the Palestinian inhabitants of the contiguous, predominantly Arab-owned Jewish Quarter, who, he claimed, had 'no special feeling for the place and would be satisfied to receive ample compensation for their expulsion. The Jerusalem Post described the area as a jumble of hovels on the same day bulldoizing operations began, and a writer later commented on this designation as follows:\nThe day the bulldozing began the quarter was described in The Jerusalem Post as a slum. Two days later it was reported as having been by and large abandoned during the siege. I expect in time that its existence will vanish altogether from the pages of developing Zionist history.\n\nShlomo Lahat, who had just flown back from a fund-raising campaign in South America, recalled that on his arrival at 4 am 7 June, Moshe Dayan informed him of the imminent conquest of Jerusalem, and that he wanted Lahat, a stickler for discipline, as military governor of the city. He needed someone \"prepared to shoot Jews if need be\". Once the city was taken, at a meeting involving himself, Dayan, Kollek and Uzi Narkiss, Lahat suggested that the programmed visit of Jews on Shavuot meant that there would be a crush of people crowding in, risking a higher casualty rate than that sustained by the war, and suggested the area be cleared, an idea that met Dayah's approval. This is disputed by Ya'akov Salman who stated that it was he who raised the problem of the courtyard's limitations.\n\nThere were 135 houses in the quarter, and the destruction left at least 650 people refugees. According to one surviving eyewitness, after its capture by Israel, the entire Old City was placed under a strict curfew. On Saturday evening 10 June, the last day of the Six-Day War, coinciding with the end of the Jewish Sabbath, a number of searchlights were positioned and floodlit up the quarter's warrens. Twenty odd Jerusalem building contractors, hired by Kollek, first knocked down a public lavatory with sledgehammers. Army bulldozers were then brought in to raze the houses.\n\nThe residents were given either a few minutes, fifteen minutes or three hours to evacuate their homes. They initially refused to budge. In the face of this reluctance, lieutenant Colonel Ya'akov Salman, the deputy military governor, issued an order to an Engineering Corps officer to start bulldozing, and, on striking one particular structure, caused the whole building to collapse on its residents. It was this act which caused the remaining residents to flee their apartments and enter vehicles that were stationed outside to bus them away. Amidst the rubble, a middle-aged, or elderly woman, al-Hajjah Rasmiyyah 'Ali Taba'ki, was discovered in her death throes. One of the engineers, Yohanan Montsker, had her rushed to hospital but by midnight she was dead. According to an interview given two decades later by\nEitan Ben-Moshe, the engineer attached to the IDF Central Command who oversaw the operation, she was not the only victim. He recalled recovering 3 bodies that were transported to the Bikur Cholim Hospital, and while some other bodies were buried with the disposed rubble:\nI had thrown out all the garbage. We threw out the wreckage of houses together with the Arab corpses. We threw Arab corpses and not Jewish, so that they would not convert the area to a place where it is forbidden to tread.\nThe following morning, Colonel Lahat described the demolition workers as mostly being drunk \"on wine and joy\".\n\nPermission to salvage their personal belongings was denied. The reason given by an Israeli soldier was that they were pressed for time, since only two days remained before the feast of the \"Passover\" (actually Shavuot), and many Jews were expected to arrive on the following Tuesday at the Western Wall. The haste of demolition was necessary, it was argued, to prepare a yard for the festive worshippers. The prime minister at the time, Levi Eshkol was completely unaware of the operation, and phoned Narkiss on the 11th asking the reason why the houses were being demolished. Narkiss, pretending not to know, replied that he'd look into the matter.\n\nIn addition to 135 houses, the demolition destroyed the \"Bou Medyan\" zaouia, the Sheikh Eid Mosque, – one of the few mosques remaining from the time of Saladin, whose historic significance was identified by the Israel Antiquities Authority. In destroying the small mosque near the Buraq section of the Wall, associated with the ascent of Mohammad on his steed Buraq to heaven, the engineer Ben Moshe is quoted as having exclaimed: \"Why shouldn't the mosque be sent to Heaven, just as the magic horse did?\"\n\nTwo years later, another complex of buildings close to the wall, that included \"Madrasa Fakhriya\" (\"Fakhriyyah zawiyya\") and the house in front of the Bab al-Magharibah that the Abu al-Sa'ud family had occupied since the 16th century but which had been spared in the 1967 destruction, were demolished in June 1969. The Abu al-Sa'ud building was a well-known example of Mamluk architecture, and there were several reasons given for its demolition. Its removal enabled Israeli archaeologists to excavate in the area; to provide open ground to enable the IDF to access the area rapidly should troubles arise at the Wall, and finally, while the antiquity of the housing complex was admitted, the fact too that extensive repairs to the roof and balconies had been made using railway track beams and concrete was adduced to assert that they had sufficient modern traces to be accidental to the area's history. Yasser Arafat's mother was of al-Sa'ud stock, and it appears that Arafat had lived in the house during his childhood, in the years 1933 to 1936.\n\nOn 12 June, at a Ministerial Meeting on the Status of Jerusalem, when the issue of demolitions in the Old City was broached, the Justice Minister Ya'akov Shapira judged that:\"They are illegal demolitions but it's good that they are being done.\" Lieutenant Colonel Yaakov Salman, the deputy military governor in charge of the operation, aware of possible legal trouble on account of the Fourth Geneva Convention forearmed himself with documents from the East Jerusalem municipality testifying to the poor sanitary conditions in the neighborhood and Jordanian plans to eventually evacuate it. By the 14th, some 200,000 Israelis had come to visit the site.\n\nOn 18 April 1968, the Israeli government expropriated the land for public use and paid from 100 to 200 Jordanian dinars to each family that had been displaced. 41 heads of families who had been evicted from the area wrote to Kollek to thank him for his assistance in resettling them in better housing conditions. The rest of the families have refused compensation on the grounds that it would lend legitimacy to what Israel did to them.\n\nIn the post-1967 period, many of the evicted refugees managed to emigrate to Morocco via Amman due to the intervention of King Hassan II. Other refugee families resettled in the Shu'afat refugee camp and other parts of Jerusalem. The prayer site was extended southwards to double its length from 28 to 60 meters, and the original plaza of four meters to 40 meters: the small 120 square meter area in front of the wall became the Western Wall Plaza, now in use as an open-air synagogue covering 20,000 square meters.\n\nIn a letter to the United Nations, the Israeli government stated nine months later that the buildings were demolished after the Jordanian government had allowed the neighborhood to become a slum area.\n\nThe expelled community continues to elect an administrator or mukhtar for the no-longer existing Moroccan Quarter.\n\nAccording to Gershom Gorenberg,\nThe action fit the pre-state strategy of the Zionist left, which believed in speaking softly and \"creating facts\"; using faits accomplis to determine the political future of disputed land.'\n\n"}

The title is a quote from the balcony scene in William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\". The collection was assembled from the US collections \"The Shape of Space\" and \"All the Myriad Ways\".\n\nThe 1974 Sphere paperback version of the collection only contained seven of the twelve stories originally included in the 1973 Gollancz hardback edition.\n\nFirst appearance: 1971 short story collection \"All the Myriad Ways\". The short story won the 1972 Hugo Award for best short story.\n\nStan, the narrator, notices that the Moon is glowing much brighter than ever before. The people he meets as the story begins all praise the Moon's increased beauty but lack the scientific background to understand its cause. However the narrator surmises that the Sun has gone nova, the day side of the Earth is already destroyed, and this is the last night of his life. He then calls and visits his girlfriend Leslie, presuming her ignorant of the situation, but she realizes it independently when Jupiter brightens with appropriate delay; they then enjoy their last night on the town, before rain and winds start.\n\nLater, he realizes one other possibility. In case he is right, they find appropriate supplies and seek refuge from the coming natural disasters in Leslie's high-rise apartment. The second possibility turns out to be correct: the Earth has \"merely\" been struck by an enormous solar flare—by far the worst disaster in human history, with most (if not all) people in the Eastern Hemisphere presumed dead, but humans in the Americas have a chance of surviving the cataclysm. The vaporized seawater leads to torrential rains, hurricanes and floods. The story ends at the break of an overcast, gray morning, with Leslie's apartment becoming an island among the raging flood waters, but with the narrator rather optimistically wondering \"if our children would colonize Europe, or Asia, or Africa.\"\n\nIn 1996, the story was made into an episode of \"The Outer Limits\" television series written by Brad Wright.\n\nJo Walton in 1997 wrote a short poem, \"The End of the World in Duxford\", as \"an unauthorised version of 'Inconstant Moon', a British equivalent.\"\n\nFirst appearance: \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\", April 1966.\n\nA prototype faster-than-light spacecraft crewed by two men is sent to the Sirius system, known from robotic exploration to include an earthlike world. In orbit around the world, they notice that one of the continents has a thin, strange border all the way round its coastline, which radiates a low heat and appears black in visible light. After exploring the edges of the smaller continents, and discovering that the ocean hosts only one lifeform—a single species of algae that they think might have been genetically engineered—they decide to explore the large continent with the border.\n\nWhen they discover just what the black border is—a seething mass of trapped humans with very dark skin, feeding off the algae and each other—the result is the death, by suicide, of one of the crew, and the self-destruction of the ship by the traumatized survivor upon his return to Earth—and a chilling reminder that there may be great danger waiting for further human explorers. The story ends on a hopeful note, with the project leader believing that Earth can help the humans at Sirius, and a fearful one, with the crewman then speculating that the humans were seeded by carnivorous aliens as food animals.\n\nIn the notes to his collection \"Convergent Series\", Niven wrote that \"Bordered in Black\"\n\nFirst appearance: \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", October 1966. A Known Space story.\n\nThe 15-man team setting up the first base on Mars experience tragedy when a murder is committed. Carter, the murderer, in the process of escaping on one of the transportation buggies crashes through the plastic bubble which holds in the base's atmosphere in an attempt to kill everyone else; however, it fails, and he is soon chased by Alf, the brother of the victim on another buggy.\n\nThe lethal chase, with the two combatants in constant radio communication, slowly reveals the community stresses which resulted in the murder. Alf wants to kill Carter in revenge for his brother, while Carter wishes the same \"and\" to try once more to destroy the base ... but with limited oxygen in their tanks, the two men must ensure that they have enough left to return to base.\n\nThis story appeared originally on \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", in December 1966. It is a Known Space story.\n\nA sequel to \"How the Heroes Die\". Muller, a smuggler with a cargo of precious magnetic monopoles, attempts to use Mars (the 'hole' of the title; to spacers, planets are merely gravity wells to be avoided if possible) as a means to whip his ship to a new orbit that will enable him to escape the customs authorities who are chasing him. His plan fails, and he crashlands, close to the now-abandoned base. Over the next few days, he explores the ruins and finds out the terrible story of what happened.

They emerge in the Solar System's far future, at which time the sun has become a greenish-white dwarf and Earth has lost its atmosphere and become a tidally locked world; i.e., it only presents \"one face\" to the sun. The ship's main computer has also been damaged, so its decision to have the captain replaced by one of the passengers to maximize survival causes disagreement. The damage to the ship prevents it traveling faster than light, and the passengers and crew debate using the ship's remaining sub-light engine to travel relativistically to a neighboring star to look for a more viable planet.\n\nReluctantly, believing that any other similarly senescent star will offer no better option, the people accede to the new captain's order to land on Earth despite the lack of an atmosphere. However, this is not a haphazard decision by the new captain, who is an astrophysicist. He is convinced that there is a remnant atmosphere frozen on the dark side, and uses the ship's drive to begin to re-spin Earth. (The drive really \"is\" powerful enough to achieve this within a reasonable timescale, if only the planet's crust can withstand the seismic stresses without catastrophic earthquakes.) This will, he hopes, convert this frozen gas back to a breathable atmosphere.\n\nFirst appearance: \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\", July 1965.

When Howie can find nothing physically wrong with the system, he can only conclude that, disturbingly, the problem is with Eric. He believes Eric has a psychosomatic disorder preventing him from operating the ramjets, using the analogy of a traumatized soldier that can no longer feel his hand and pull the trigger of a gun.\n\nAfter revealing his theory to Eric, Eric admits it is a possibility but insists that Howie keep inspecting the ship, reasoning that Howie is the only one that can check for mechanical problems. Howie agrees, but secretly has convinced himself that the problem is truly with Eric.\n\nIn an effort to cure Eric using a placebo, Howie creates buckets of ice-water using the ship's freezer, and dumps it into the wiring panels on the wings, telling Eric that the heat and pressure of Venus might be affecting the ship's function. Eric regains the use of the ramjets and the pair manage to escape from Venus and back to Earth.\n\nOn the trip back, Howie reveals his ruse to Eric. Eric insists that the cause was mechanical, and challenges Howie to a $5,000 bet that the problem will be found back on Earth. Howie accepts the bet. Back on Earth, the mechanics determine that, indeed, it was a mechanical problem due to the pressure of Venus's atmosphere.\n\n\"Becalmed in Hell\" was nominated for the 1965 Nebula Award for best short story.\n\nFirst appearance: \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", January 1969 (as \"The Organleggers\").

It had one, two or five barrels, was fed from a vertical magazine or hopper and was operated by a crank. When the crank was turned, a feed arm positioned a cartridge in the breech, the bolt closed and the weapon fired. Turning the crank further opened the breechblock and extracted the spent case.\n\nThe Gardner machine gun was invented in 1874 by William Gardner of Toledo, Ohio formerly a captain in the Union army during the American Civil War. After producing a prototype he went to the Pratt and Whitney company, who after a year of development produced a military version of the weapon.\n\nA demonstration to officers at the United States Navy yard in 1875 was successful, however they recommended that Pratt and Whitney continue with development of the system, incorporating improvements to the feed system, which were designed by E.G. Parkhurst, an engineer at Pratt and Whitney. The army attended the tests, but showed no interest in the weapon.\n\nParkhurst added many improvements to the gun's firing mechanism which made it more reliable. During 1877 additional tests took place with a .45 calibre (11.4 mm) version of the weapon, which determined its muzzle velocity to be 1,280 feet per second (390 m/s).\n\nOn 17 June 1879 a further demonstration was carried out at the Navy Yard, during which the weapon was presented by Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney. The weapon fired a total of 10,000 rounds during the test, taking a total elapsed time of 27 minutes 36 seconds, with breaks between firing to resolve an issue with one of the extractors. While the test was not without issues the weapon managed to fire 4,722 rounds before the first stoppage, and after the stoppage was resolved it fired approximately 5,000 rounds without incident.\n\nOn 15 January and 17 March 1880 duplicate tests were conducted at Sandy Hook proving ground in front of an Army review board. The weapon performed well, and they recommended that the Army buy a limited number for field evaluation, noting the low cost of the weapon. However the Army declined to purchase.\n\nAt this point, the British Royal Navy, which had successfully deployed the Gatling gun, became interested in the weapon, and Gardner was invited to England to exhibit his invention. The Admiralty were so impressed by the demonstrations that they adopted the weapon and purchased the rights to produce it in England. Gardner remained in England to supervise the construction of the weapons.\n\nThe British Army then took an interest in machine guns and after a series of trials selected the Gardner gun. During these tests a five-barrelled Gardner gun fired 16,754 rounds before a failure occurred, with only 24 stoppages. When operator-induced errors were taken into account, there were only 4 malfunctions in 10,000 rounds fired. The Army adopted the weapon, although its introduction was delayed because of opposition from the Royal Artillery. It saw action in the Mahdist War (in Sudan), notably at the Battle of Abu Klea, where its mechanism proved vulnerable to desert sand and dust blowing about.\n\nThere was also the .577/450 Martini–Henry calibre Bira gun, based upon the Gardner gun but with dual barrels, an overhead drum magazine, and designed in Nepal.\n\nIt is noted that the Bira was only ever produced in very small numbers. These are extremely rare and a wonderful example of Victorian firepower. An American company International Military Antiques found a limited number of these exceptionally scarce weapons in the Old Palace of Lagan Silekhana in Kathmandu, Nepal which were included with the purchase of over 50,000 Antique Firearms from the Royal Nepalese Army in 2003. There is controversy, as the arms cache had to tranship through India and questions remain as to the purchase.\n\n\n\n"}

He was part of the \"Generation of 1880\" along with Ottorino Respighi, Gian Francesco Malipiero, and Alfredo Casella. They were among the first Italian composers in some time whose primary contributions were not in opera. (The instrumental and \"a cappella\" traditions had never died in Italian music and had produced, for instance, the string quartets of Antonio Scontrino (1850-1922) and the works of Respighi's teacher Giuseppe Martucci; but with the \"Generation of 1880\" these traditions became stronger.)\n\nIldebrando Pizzetti was the son of Odoardo Pizzetti, a pianist and piano teacher who was his son's first teacher. At first Pizzetti seemed headed for a career as a playwright—he had written several plays, two of which had been produced—before he decided in 1895 on a career in music and entered the Conservatorium of Parma.\n\nThere he was taught from 1897 by Giovanni Tebaldini and gained the beginnings of his lifelong interest in the early music of Italy, reflected in his own music and his writings.\n\nHe taught at the Conservatory in Florence (director from 1917 to 1923), directed the Milan Conservatory from 1923, and was Respighi's successor at the Academy of St. Cecilia in Rome from 1936 to 1958) His students included Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Olga Rudge, Manoah Leide-Tedesco and Franco Donatoni. Also a music critic, he wrote several books on the music of Italy and of Greece and co-founded a musical journal. Pizzetti was an active supporter of fascism and signed the Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals in 1925.\n\nA disciple of poet, playwright and revolutionary Gabriele d'Annunzio, Pizzetti wrote incidental music to his plays, and was highly influenced by d'Annunzio's dark neoclassic themes. One of Pizzetti's later operas is a setting of d'Annunzio's \"La Figlia Di Jorio\".\n\nHe was named to the Royal Academy of Italy in 1939. As noted by Sciannameo, his relations with the Fascist government of the 1940s were often positive, sometimes mixed; he received at one point high awards, and the one symphony of his mature years was the product of a commission from their Japanese allies to celebrate the \"XXVI Centennial of the foundation of the Japanese Empire\" (Benjamin Britten's \"Sinfonia da Requiem\" was also commissioned for this event, though it was rejected on account of its finale; its original finale was rediscovered after Britten's death and only premiered then.) Pizzetti's Symphony in A was premiered as noted in the article, and recorded in 1940, and again by Naxos with his Harp Concerto (Naxos 8573613, 2017)\n\nHis Violin Concerto in A was premiered in 1944 by Gioconda de Vito; this seems to be the only 20th century violin concerto she ever played.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276214", "title": "Ovimbundu", "text": "Ovimbundu\n\nThe Ovimbundu, also known as the Southern Mbundu, are a Bantu ethnic group who live on the Bié Plateau of central Angola and in the coastal strip west of these highlands. As the largest ethnic group in Angola, they make up almost 40 percent of the country's population. Overwhelmingly the Ovimbundu follow Christianity, mainly the \"Igreja Evangélica Congregacional de Angola (IECA)\", founded by American missionaries, and the Catholic Church. However, some still retain beliefs and practices from African traditional religions.\n\nThe origins of the Ovimbundu are Bantu populations who drifted in from the North, over the last millennium, and formed local/regional groups which slowly became political units and foci of social identity: M'Balundu, Sele, Wambo, Bieno and others. They developed a sophisticated agriculture, completed by the breeding of small animals (chicken, goats, swine) as well as of a modicum of cows bought from the farmer-herders to the South (Nyaneka-Nkhumbi, Ovambo).\n\nIncisive change came about when the Portuguese established a colonial bridgehead in Benguela, in the 16th century. Several of the small \"kingdoms\" saw their advantage in organising an intense caravan trade between Benguela and peoples of the East, in particular the Chokwe, the Luvale and the Mbunda, from whom they obtained wax, rubber, honey and ivory. Each trading caravan had a professional leader and diviner. Trade agreements that had linked the independent chiefdoms led to the development of regional specializations, including metalwork and cornmeal production. Slavery and the slave trade were also an integral part of Ovimbundu societies. Caravan trading declined with the suppression of the slave trade and, more importantly, the construction of the Benguela Railway in 1904, and came to an end shortly after 1910.\n\nIn the following years, the Ovimbundu completely changed their economy to cash crop production of corn, sold to a rapidly increasing network of Portuguese traders. However, because of their demographic growth, and because significant portions of their lands were appropriated by Europeans for coffee, sisal and other plantations, many Ovimbundu started to work as paid labour, mainly on European plantations in their own region or in Northwest Angola, but also in Namibian mines.\n\nThe Ovimbundu are the main social basis of UNITA, an anti-colonial movement that fought against the Portuguese from 1966 to 1974, was an adversary of the rival movement MPLA during the Angolan Civil War of 1975 to 2002, and is at present an opposition political party.\n\nDuring the Civil War the two major cities located in Umbundu territory, Huambo and Kuito, were to a large extent destroyed by the MPLA and UNITA respectively, as were a considerable number of villages and much infrastructure (roads, railways, bridges etc.). Many people died, and many others fled to cities either in their own area (Benguela, Lobito) or in distant areas (mainly Luanda and its surroundings, but also Lubango). During long periods parts of Umbundu territory were under UNITA control.\n\nSince 2002, considerable efforts at reconstruction have been made - by the government, interested in national reconciliation, but to a large extent by the people themselves, by the churches and by a variety of NGOs. A significant proportion of the \"internally displaced\" Ovimbundu have returned to their places of origin, where traditional forms of social organization have often survived or then been reconstituted. However, larger or smaller Ovimbundu communities have remained in many cities outside their habitat, so that a significant part of this people is now scattered all over Angola.\n\nIn political terms, the Angolan parliamentary elections of 2008 reflected an important shift in Ovimbundu loyalty: while most of them had voted UNITA in the previous (1992) election, their majority now voted MPLA - because (after the death of Jonas Savimbi) UNITA had lost much of its credibility, but also because strengthening UNITA was seen as implying the risk of a renewal of armed violence.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276217", "title": "Cuneiform law", "text": "Cuneiform law\n\nCuneiform law refers to any of the legal codes written in cuneiform script, that were developed and used throughout the ancient Middle East among the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Elamites, Hurrians, Kassites, and Hittites. The Code of Hammurabi is the most well-known of the cuneiform laws, but there were a number of precursor laws.\n\nAlthough they were written in several different cities and kingdoms, these early laws have a number of formulae in common. Most contain both an epilogue and a prologue, which usually explain the purpose of composing the laws, invoke divine authority, and command the reader to abide by them. They are always imposed or 'enacted' in the name of a ruler, be it a prince or king, and show no sign of being the result of legislative bodies.\n\nWhile many of these codes are only partially known, they nevertheless paint a fairly clear picture that enables us to learn what issues pertaining to rules were considered significant by the societies they governed in the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st millennia BC.\n\nUnlike modern codes, Cuneiform law provides no universal formula for general areas of law. Rather, laws typically consist of specific \"if... then...\" cases that are meant to act as an example or precedent. Punishments for crimes vary from code to code, but not all prescribe vengeance. Some call only for fines in certain instances, such as in the Code of Ur-Nammu, where one line reads: \"If a man knocks out the eye of another man, he shall weigh out one-half a mina of silver.\" These cases are sometimes arranged in a seemingly random order, though this may be the result of an inability to properly interpret them today as they would have been at the time they were in force.\n\nCuneiform law is generally classified separately from later Middle Eastern law, but has been viewed as a predecessor of Biblical and Jewish law. The communities of the Middle East that made use of cuneiform law were generally all in contact with one another, and developed similar cultures. Akkadian, a cuneiform language, was used throughout the entire area, and even as far as Egypt, for diplomatic communications during the Amarna Period.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276218", "title": "Fraudulent conveyance", "text": "Fraudulent conveyance\n\nA fraudulent conveyance, or fraudulent transfer, is an attempt to avoid debt by transferring money to another person or company. It is generally a civil, not a criminal matter, meaning that one cannot go to jail for it, but in some jurisdictions there is potential for criminal prosecution. It is generally treated as a civil cause of action that arises in debtor/creditor relations, particularly with reference to insolvent debtors. The cause of action is typically brought by creditors or by bankruptcy trustees. \n\nA transfer will be fraudulent if made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor. Thus, if a transfer is made with the specific intent to avoid satisfying a specific liability, then actual intent is present. However, when a debtor prefers to pay one creditor instead of another, that is not a fraudulent transfer.\n\nThere are two types of fraudulent transfer—\"actual fraud\" and \"constructive fraud\". \"Actual fraud\" typically involves a debtor who as part of an asset protection scheme donates his assets, usually to an \"insider\", and leaves himself nothing to pay his creditors. \"Constructive fraud\" does not relate to fraudulent intent, but rather to the underlying economics of the transaction, if it took place for less than reasonably equivalent value at a time when the debtor was in a distressed financial condition. It is important to note that the actual distinction between the two different types of fraud is what the intentions of the debtor were. For example, where the debtor has simply been more generous than they should have or, in business transactions, the business should have ceased trading earlier to preserve capital (see generally, \"wrongful trading\"). In a successful lawsuit, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the property transferred or its value from the transferee who has received a gift of the debtor's assets. Subsequent transferees may also be targeted, although they generally have stronger defenses than immediate transferees.\n\nAlthough fraudulent transfer law originally evolved in the context of a relatively simple agrarian economy, it is now widely used to challenge complex modern financial transactions such as leveraged buyouts.\n\nFraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required \"dueling\" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results. Courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to make this analysis simpler, more consistent across cases, and more predictable.\n\nEvidence of actual intent is rarely available to a creditor for it would require proof of someone’s inner thoughts. Because of that, creditors often have to rely on circumstantial evidence of fraud. To prove actual intent, the courts have developed “badges of fraud,” which, while not conclusive, are considered by the courts as circumstantial evidence of fraud:\n\n\nUnder Australian law, if a transaction is entered into by a company which subsequently goes into liquidation, and the transaction was entered into by the company for the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors during the 10 years prior to the relation back day, the courts may set it aside. The relation-back day is defined as either the day upon which the application for the company's winding-up was filed, or the date of the commencement of liquidation.\n\nCanadian provinces have jurisdiction over property and civil rights, which includes conveyances of property. Many provinces have statutes prohibiting fraudulent conveyances. They also prohibit the granting of fraudulent preferences, which purport to give certain creditors priority over other creditors in bankruptcy.. However, bona fide purchasers for value without notice are generally not liable for the actions of the fraudulent conveyer.\n\n\nIn Anglo-American law, the doctrine of Fraudulent Conveyance traces its origins back to \"Twyne's Case\", in which an English farmer attempted to defraud his creditors by selling his sheep to a man named Twyne, while remaining in possession of the sheep, marking and shearing them. In the United States, fraudulent conveyances or transfers are governed by two sets of laws that are generally consistent. The first is the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"UFTA\") that has been adopted by all but a handful of the states. The second is found in the federal Bankruptcy Code.\n\nThe UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the \"actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud\" any creditor of the debtor.\n\nThere are two kinds of fraudulent transfer. The archetypal example is the intentional fraudulent transfer. This is a transfer of property made by a debtor with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay his or her creditors. The second is a constructive fraudulent transfer. Generally, this occurs when a debtor transfers property without receiving \"reasonably equivalent value\" in exchange for the transfer if the debtor is insolvent at the time of the transfer or becomes insolvent or is left with unreasonably small capital to continue in business as a result of the transfer. Unlike the intentional fraudulent transfer, no intention to defraud is necessary.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Code authorizes a bankruptcy trustee to recover the property transferred fraudulently for the benefit of all of the creditors of the debtor if the transfer took place within the relevant time frame. The transfer may also be recovered by a bankruptcy trustee under the UFTA too, if the state in which the transfer took place has adopted it and the transfer took place within its relevant time period. Creditors may also pursue remedies under the UFTA without the necessity of a bankruptcy.\nBecause this second type of transfer does not necessarily involve any actual wrongdoing, it is a common trap into which honest, but unwary debtors fall when filing a bankruptcy petition without an attorney. Particularly devastating and not uncommon is the situation in which an adult child takes title to the parents' home as a self-help probate measure (in order to avoid any confusion about who owns the home when the parents die and to avoid losing the home to a perceived threat from the state). Later, when the parents file a bankruptcy petition without recognizing the problem, they are unable to exempt the home from administration by the trustee. Unless they are able to pay the trustee an amount equal to the greater of the equity in the home or the sum of their debts (either directly to the Chapter 7 trustee or in payments to a Chapter 13 trustee), the trustee will sell their home to pay the creditors. In many cases, the parents would have been able to exempt the home and carry it safely through a bankruptcy if they had retained title or had recovered title before filing.\n\nEven \"good faith purchasers\" of property who are the recipients of fraudulent transfers are only partially protected by the law in the U.S. Under the Bankruptcy Code, they get to keep the transfer to the extent of the value they gave for it, which means that they may lose much of the benefit of their bargain, even though they have no knowledge that the transfer to them is fraudulent.\n\nOften fraudulent transfers occur in connection with leveraged buyouts (LBOs), where the management/owners of a failing corporation will cause the corporation to borrow on its assets and use the loan proceeds to purchase the management/owner's stock at highly inflated prices. The creditors of the corporation will then often have little or no unencumbered assets left upon which to collect their debts. LBOs can be either intentional or constructive fraudulent transfers, or both, depending on how obviously the corporation is financially impaired when the transaction is completed.\n\nAlthough not all LBOs are fraudulent transfers, a red flag is raised when, after an LBO, the company then cannot pay its creditors.\n\nFraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required \"dueling\" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results. U.S. courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to streamline the analysis of constructive fraud, and judges are increasingly focusing on these market based measures.\n\nUnder Swiss law, creditors who hold a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against third parties that have benefited from unfair preferences or fraudulent transfers by the debtor prior to a seizure of assets or a bankruptcy.\n\nFraudulent conveyance or also known as action revocatoire or Pauline action (채권자취소권) is a right to preserve the debtor's property for all creditors by canceling an action by the debtor which reduces the debtor's property with a knowledge that the action harms the rights of the creditor. To exercise this right, the creditor must have a right against the debtor that is monetary and not unique and personal in nature. For instance, the right to demand to clear of the land of the building or the right to delivery the land involves land and unique and therefore not subject to Pauline action (Supreme Court of South Korea, February 10, 1995, 94da2534).\n\n"}
{"id": "2276219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276219", "title": "United Federation of Teachers", "text": "United Federation of Teachers\n\nThe United Federation of Teachers (UFT) is the labor union that represents most teachers in New York City public schools. , there were about 118,000 in-service teachers and 17,000 paraprofessional educators in the union, as well as about 54,000 retired members. In October 2007, 28,280 home day care providers voted to join the union. It is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers, the AFL-CIO and the Central Labor Council. It is also the largest member of New York State United Teachers, which is affiliated with the National Educational Association and Education International.\n\nTwo previous unions of New York schoolteachers, the Teachers Union, founded in 1916, and the Teachers Guild, founded in 1935, failed to gather widespread enrollment or support. Many of the early leaders were pacifists or socialists and so frequently met with clashes against more right-leaning newspapers and organizations of the time, as red-baiting was fairly common. The ethnically and ideologically diverse teachers associations of the city made the creation of a single organized body difficult, with each association continuing to vie for its own priorities irrespective of the others.\n\nThe UFT was founded in 1960, largely in response to perceived unfairness in the educational system's treatment of teachers. Pensions were awarded to retired teachers only if over 65 or with 35 years of service. Female teachers faced two years of mandatory unpaid maternity leave after they gave birth. Principals could discipline or fire teachers with almost no oversight. The schools, experiencing a massive influx of baby boomer students, often were on double or triple session. Despite being college-educated professionals, often holding advanced master's degrees, teachers drew a salary of $66 per week, in 2005 dollars, the equivalent of $21,000 a year.\n\nThe UFT was created on March 16, 1960 and grew rapidly. On November 7, 1960, the union organized a major strike. The strike largely failed in its main objectives but obtained some concessions, as well as bringing much popular attention to the union. After much further negotiation, the UFT was chosen as the collective bargaining organization for all City teachers in December 1961.\n\nAlbert Shanker, a controversial but successful organizer was president of the UFT from 1964 until 1984. He held an overlapping tenure as president of the national American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to his death in 1997.\n\nIn 1968, the UFT went on strike and shut down the school system in May and then again from September to November to protest the decentralization plan that was being put in place to give more neighborhoods community control. The Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike focused on the Ocean Hill-Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn but, ironically, the schools in that area were among the few that were open in the entire city. The Ocean Hill-Brownsville crisis is often described as a turning point in the history of unionism and of civil rights, as it created a rift between African-Americans and the Jewish communities, two groups that were previously viewed as allied. The two sides threw accusations of racism and anti-Semitism at each other.\n\nFollowing the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, some 14,000 teachers were laid off and class size soared. Another strike addressed some of these complaints and gave long-serving teachers longevity benefits.\n\nThe Unity Caucus, formed in 1962, predominates in the union, holding nearly every leadership position. New Action formed in the 1980s as an opposition caucus but, since 2003, it has cross-endorsed Unity candidates. The Movement of Rank and File Educators (MORE) is a new caucus, formed in 2012.\n\nIn the spring 2013 UFT election campaign, president Michael Mulgrew (Unity) refused repeated requests to debate his opponent, Julie Cavanagh (MORE).\n\nAccording to UFT's Department of Labor records since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, about 32% of the union's membership are considered retirees, with eligibility to vote in the union. UFT contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which, since 2005, have numbered comparatively about 1% of the size of the union's membership. As of 2013 this accounts for 59,444 retirees and 2,675 non-members paying agency fees, compared to 124,145 \"active\" members.\n\nThe previous president of the UFT, Randi Weingarten, resigned in 2009 to lead the AFT. She has clashed repeatedly with the mayors of the city; in particular with former mayor Rudy Giuliani and mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg made student promotion to third, sixth and eighth grade contingent upon performance on standardized tests, which the UFT and the New York Board of Regents have criticized as being flawed.\n\nThe UFT opposes merit pay for teachers, opting for seniority-based pay, but joined in November 2007, with Mayor Bloomberg in agreeing to a voluntary incentive program for high-achieving schools with high-needs populations. The union does not support a proposed reform of the seniority-based LIFO (education) law. In July 2007,Weingarten collaborated with Mayor Bloomberg in supporting a modified merit pay program with bonuses to schools and additional bonuses targeted for specific teachers.\n\nThe UFT strongly supports the reduction of class sizes for all subjects and grade levels in New York City public schools.\n\nThe UFT, under the leadership of presidents Weingarten and Mulgrew, has collaborated with tenets of the education reform movement, such as support for value-added modeling for teacher evaluation.\n\nIn May 2011, the UFT, along with the NAACP and others, filed a lawsuit against the New York City Department of Education to stop school closings and the co-location of schools. In the lawsuit, the union charged that the Department of Education was improperly closing schools.\n\nThe lawsuit also asked the court to stop school co-locations.\n\nBefore a court hearing on the suit in June 2011, parent groups held a news conference to thank the NAACP for fighting on behalf of all kids and to press for fairness and equity.\n\nThe New York City Parents Union filed its own lawsuit in June 2011 to stop co-locations and school closings, stating, “Despite inconsistent and uncertain results, the DOE continues to push public school parents into a privately managed school system where many charters perform worse than the public schools while failing to serve their fair share of students with special needs and English Language Learners.”\n\nOn Friday June 24, 2011, UFT President Michael Mulgrew, along with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, announced that an agreement had been reached to prevent the layoff of 4,100 New York City teachers. The agreement came six months after Mayor Bloomberg had warned 21,000 layoffs were possible. The union had opposed all layoffs with a strategy of leafleting, marches and rallies, including a march on Wall Street on May 12, 2011, with 20,000 participants.\n\n\n"}

Further, a reading of the earliest extant manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah indicate that gevil was halakha derived from Moses and thus required for Torah scrolls.\n\nMaimonides wrote that it is a law given to Moses at Sinai that a Torah scroll must be written either \"gevil\" or \"klaf\" in order to be valid, and that it is preferable that they be written on \"gevil\".\n\nRelated to , \"gewil\", a rolling (i.e. unhewn) stone, cf. , \"to roll.\" \n\n\"Gevil\" is a form skin for \"safrut\" (halakhic writing) that is made of tanned, whole hide.\nThe precise requirements for processing \"gevil\" are laid down by the Talmud, Geonim and Rishonim.\nAccording to law, the preparation of gevil must include salt, flour and \"mey afatzim\" (wasp residue/gall-nut water). (Shabbat. 79b) \nThese requirements were reconfirmed as a Law given to Moses at Sinai by Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah. \nGall nuts—rich in tannic acid—are a tree's reaction to an invasive parasitic wasp's egg; the pure black tint of the ink used on Torahs results from the reaction between the tannic acid and iron sulfate (a powder used to make the ink).\n\nThere are three forms of tanned skin known to Jewish law. The other two forms (qelaf and dukhsustus) result from splitting the hide into two layers; however, there is some dispute as to their identification.\nOthers deviate from the traditional process and use modern chemical processes instead. However, some believe that this invalidates the parchment for scribal use.\n\nAccording to the \"Halakhot Gedolot\", klaf is the inner layer, adjacent to the flesh, while \"dukhsustos\" is the outer layer, on which the hair grows:\n\nThe same view is expressed in the oldest extant manuscripts and critical editions of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah and the Babylonian Talmud (\"Shab. 79b\").\nThis is also the same definition which appears in the minor Talmudic tractate called Sofrim. \nHowever, more recent authorities reverse the two descriptions, and many printed editions of the Mishneh Torah are \"adjusted\" to reflect this. The reason for this original adjustment away from the original definition is a mystery. Some suspect that copying errors are to blame. As a result, many have become confused, in terms of which part of the skin should be used for writing. Using the full hide known as gevil for Sifrei Torah does avoid this issue, but unfortunately this solution won't work for tefilin which must be written on Klaf and are not kosher if written on gevil.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, Moses used \"gevil\" for the Torah scroll he placed into the Holy Ark of the Covenant. Elsewhere in the Talmud, there is testimony that Torah scrolls were written on \"gevil\".\n\nToday, a handful of Jewish scribes and artisans continue to make scroll material in this way. However, the majority of Torah scrolls are written on \"klaf\", in their belief that the Talmud recommends (as opposed to requires) \"gevil\" and relates to the optimal beautification of the scrolls rather than an essential halachic requirement. Given the uncertainty about which layer of the hide is in fact the \"klaf\", there is a growing movement for insisting on a return to \"gevil\" in Torah scrolls - in order to avoid all doubts. Clearly, the antiquity of gevil (as the original practice) is not being debated by anyone.\n\nMost of the Dead Sea Scrolls (200 BCE), found in and around the caves of Qumran near the Dead Sea, are written on \"gevil\".\n\nProperly, \"klaf\" should be used for tefillin and duchsustus for mezuzot. Once more, this rule is often relaxed in practice but there is a minority which seeks to return to the actual law.\n\n\n"}

The film is made up of four short films based on urban legends; the first concerns a woman who encounters a killer in the back seat of her car; the second concerns a video game-addicted teenager who is consumed by his game; the third focuses on a fallen priest who is stalked by a pickup truck from hell; and the last follows a suburban family battling a giant rat in their home.\n\nDuring a traffic stop at night, a cop is stabbed to death by someone leaping from the bushes. A killer is terrorizing a local California area and the TV and radio are reporting that the cop is his fifth victim.\n\nAfter Lisa (Raines) puts her children to bed, she discovers that she is out of cigarettes. Her husband (Joe Lambie) forbids her to go to the store, but she sneaks out anyway and heads down the canyon.\n\nLisa gets the cigarettes and begins home only to realize that she is almost out of gas. All the gas stations appear to be closed. Finally, she stops at an out of the way station and out comes an attendant (William Sanderson), who just happens to perfectly match the killer's description on the radio. She gets increasingly alarmed as the attendant, who seems to be studying her car and its occupant, suddenly lunges at the car with the gas nozzle. He drags her out of the car, draws a pistol and fires – to protect her from the real murderer (Lee Ving), who was hiding in her back seat.\n\nYoung Jerry \"J.J.\" Cooney (Estevez) is a video game wizard and arcade game hustler with help from his bespectacled friend Zock (Billy Jayne).\n\nAfter an argument about Jerry's obsession with video games, they split up for the day, and Jerry goes into his local arcade to try again to beat \"The Bishop of Battle\", a maddeningly difficult video game that features thirteen levels; no one he knows has made it to the thirteenth, and many believe it is just a myth. He repeatedly tries and fails to make it to the thirteenth level until the owner forces him to leave at closing time.\n\nJerry's parents, concerned about his performance in school, ground him until his grades improve. That night, he sneaks out and breaks into the arcade to finally finish the game. However, when he reaches the thirteenth level, the arcade cabinet collapses and the enemies fly out, and he defends himself with the suddenly-functioning gun from the game's controls (Estevez went through a two-week gun training session with the NYPD to realistically perform his gun maneuvers for these scenes). Jerry flees to the parking lot, but the Bishop of Battle appears, drawing closer and closer to a terrified Jerry. \n\nThe next morning, his friends and family find a reconstructed Bishop of Battle machine amid the ruins of the arcade. Jerry's image appears on the screen for a few seconds before it turns into another of the game's sprites.\n\nLance Henriksen plays a priest serving at a small parish and is facing a crisis of faith brought on by the violent death of a young boy. He explains to his bishop (Robin Gammell) that he has lost his belief in the concepts of good and evil. He leaves the rectory with some holy water that he considers merely tap water, and takes off across the desert in his car.\n\nHe encounters a black Chevrolet C-20 Fleetside that appears as if from nowhere. At first it drives threateningly then disappears, but with subsequent appearances it forces him off the road and strikes his car. The truck's driver is an unseen Satan through the truck's tinted windows, but an inverted cross can be seen hanging from the rear-view mirror. Satan's truck finally destroys the ex-priest's car in a collision that does no damage to the truck. With nowhere left to run, the former priest hurls the holy water at the truck, which is vaporized. The episode ends as the police arrive on the scene and an ambulance crew takes the injured priest back to the church.\n\nIn her home, housewife Claire (Cartwright) has been dealing with a recent rat problem as she can hear the rats in the walls and attic, but her husband Steven (Masur) ignores it.\n\nEven though Steven assures Claire that he will take care of the problem with a couple of rat traps in the attic, the disturbances progressively get worse, as objects start falling off shelves and the family cat is eaten. Soon enough, Claire calls an exterminator (Albert Hague) who discovers that the creature has gnawed huge holes behind various cabinets and has also chewed on the power cables. Steven comes home, criticizes his wife, and tells the exterminator to leave.\n\nClaire keeps consulting the exterminator and inevitably she and her family are forced into a showdown with a giant rat.\n\nTerror in Topanga\n\nThe Bishop of Battle\nThe Benediction\n\nNight of the Rat\nIt has been a long-held belief that the four segments of the film were initially conceived and shot for ABC's thriller anthology series \"Darkroom\", but were deemed too intense for television. However, on the audio commentary on the 2015 Blu-ray release, executive producer Andrew Mirisch clarifies that the film actually began life as a pilot for an unnamed anthology series for NBC before becoming a theatrical feature for Universal Pictures.\n\nThough the poster and trailer boasted that the film would be a '\"sleeper\"' and ' \"one you won't forget\" ', the film was not well received on release, with a 'rotten' 29% rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes.\nIn her review for the \"New York Times\", Janet Maslin wrote, \"Nothing spoils a horror story faster than a stupid victim. And \"Nightmares\", an anthology of four supposedly scary episodes, has plenty of those.\"\n\nThe film was released on VHS by Universal Pictures in the 1980s. It was later released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1999 in \"Full Frame (1.33:1) Presentation\" and has since gone out of print; this DVD issue of the film became extremely rare, with secondhand prices netting over one-hundred dollars.\n\nOn July 10, 2015, Scream Factory announced on their Facebook page that \"Nightmares\" was part of their roster of upcoming Blu-ray releases.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2276244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276244", "title": "Justin Allgaier", "text": "Justin Allgaier\n\nJustin Allgaier (born June 6, 1986) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He currently competes full-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 7 Chevrolet Camaro for JR Motorsports. He was the 2008 ARCA Re/Max Series Champion and the 2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series Rookie of the Year.\n\nAllgaier was born in Spaulding, Illinois and raised in Riverton, Illinois, and began his racing career at the age of five in quarter midgets, winning over one hundred races and five championships. He began stock car racing at thirteen in the UMP Late Model Series, where he competed for three seasons. At the age of sixteen, he made his debut in the ARCA RE/MAX Series at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack, driving the No. 99 Hoosier Tire Midwest/Law Automotive Chevrolet for Ken Schrader; he qualified twenty-ninth and finished seventeenth. He ran two additional races for Kerry Scherer and Bob Schacht, with a best finish of eleventh.\n\nAllgaier ran additional ARCA races in 2003, making six starts in the No. 86 owned by his father. He had a sixth-place finish in his second start at Toledo Speedway, and later the best finish of third at Salem Speedway. The next season, he made only five starts but had a second-place at Toledo. In addition, he was a representative of the United States in the South Pacific Saloon Car Championship, where he had two top-fives. In 2005, Allgaier ran seven races in ARCA, splitting time between cars owned by Wayne Hixson and Bobby Gerhart. He won his first career pole at Springfield, setting a new track record, and had four top-five finishes. He also made his NASCAR debut in the Craftsman Truck Series, making four starts in the No. 63 MB Motorsports/Dave Porter Ford. He failed to make five races and did not finish higher than 26th. That year, he appeared on the Discovery Channel program, \"\". The show's premise was Jack Roush searching for new talent to drive Roush Racing-prepared vehicles in NASCAR's top 3 series.\n\nIn 2006, Allgaier made his first full-time run in ARCA, ending 10th. He got his first career win at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack, becoming the first Springfield area resident to win in the 72-year history of championship auto racing at the fairgrounds. He made three more Truck races for MB and had a twenty-first-place finish at Kansas Speedway. In 2007, he won his second career ARCA race at Salem and finished fourth in points. He also won two features in a midget car at Angell Park Speedway and placed 3rd in the Chili Bowl behind Tony Stewart and J. J. Yeley.\n\nAllgaier returned for another full season in ARCA in 2008, driving for his family once again. He won six races, including the final three, and won the series championship by a slim margin. He broke Frank Kimmel's eight-year streak of winning the championship in that series. He also returned to NASCAR, finishing 21st in a Truck race at Kentucky Speedway. Later that year, Allgaier signed a contract with Roger Penske's No. 12 Nationwide team to run four races in the final part of the year. His best finish in the Penske Truck Rental Dodge was eleventh at Phoenix.\n\nAllgaier was then signed to drive the car full-time in 2009. Because of the acquisition of Penske Racing sponsor Alltel by Cellco Partners, a joint venture of Verizon and Vodafone, their Sprint Cup sponsorship was legislated out of the sport by NASCAR's agreement with Sprint in that series to prohibit sponsorship by other wireless telephone companies. This allowed Verizon to move their sponsorship to the Nationwide Series, where it is not prohibited, and Allgaier raced a full season with Verizon sponsorship for what became known as Penske Championship Racing. (The name change was made when Bill Davis became a minority owner of the team.) Allgaier won his first career pole in NASCAR at Memphis Motorsports Park.\n\nDuring the 2009 NAPA 200 in Montreal, Allgaier had the fastest car early in the race & while running 6th, tried to make a pass on Canadian road ace Ron Fellows and Kyle Busch. Instead he caused a wreck that took both him and Fellows out of the race and damaged Busch's hopes of winning. After this humiliating incident, Allgaier took some lessons at Fellows' road racing driving school to better his road course skills.\n\nHe won his first Nationwide Series race at Bristol Motor Speedway on March 20, 2010.\n\nAllgaier was rumored to drive the Sprint Cup Series No. 12 Penske Racing Dodge in 2011; however, instead Allgaier moved to Turner Motorsports for 2011, driving the No. 31 Chevrolet Impala full-time in the Nationwide Series for 2011. In the inaugural STP 300 at Chicagoland Speedway after passing Carl Edwards who ran out of fuel on the last lap, Allgaier won the race. Even though Allgaier ran out of fuel himself after, he was able to cross the finish line before third place Trevor Bayne to finish first. He almost won at Road America but ran out of fuel on the caution on the final lap and finished 19th.\n\nIn 2012, Allgaier returned to the renamed Turner Scott Motorsports; he passed Jacques Villeneuve on the final lap to win the NAPA Auto Parts 200 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec.\n\nIn August 2013, it was announced that Allgaier would make his NASCAR Sprint Cup Series debut the following month at Chicagoland Speedway, driving there and in two other races in Phoenix Racing's No. 51 Chevrolet, newly purchased by Turner Scott co-owner Harry Scott Jr. Allgaier finished 27th in his debut, and ran races for the team later in the year at Kansas Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway and Phoenix International Raceway.\n\nIn January 2014, it was announced that Allgaier would compete full-time for Rookie of the Year in the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, driving for the now-renamed HScott Motorsports in the No. 51 Holden Commodore.\n\nAllgaier led 4 laps in the 2014 Daytona 500 and crashed with 7 laps to go. He finished 27th. After consecutive top 20 finishes, Allgaier had a great finish in the Food City 500 avoiding several wrecks to finish 17th. At Talladega, Allgaier nearly won his first Cup series victory in the Aaron's 499, running in the top five and contending victory with 9 laps to go. He lost drafting help from Kurt Busch and as a result, lost multiple spots, finishing 27th.\n\nAllgaier lead 15 laps during the first Pocono race in early June. Taking the lead with less than 35 laps to go, Allgaier led until a yellow came out with 19 laps to go; forcing Allgaier to make a pit stop.\n\nAt Daytona in the Coke Zero 400, Allgaier ran in the top ten early in the race. He unfortunately was caught up in \"The Big One\" that took out over 27 cars. Allgaier, while trying to avoid wrecking, tapped Kyle Busch, who was already wrecking. Allgaier's contact caused Busch to come back onto the apron and be t-boned by Cole Whitt.\n\nAllgaier missed the field for the 2014 GEICO 500, failing to qualify for the first time in his Cup career. The new restrictor-plate qualifying process became controversial amongst drivers and fans because many drivers complained that they barely managed to make the show because of the system.\n\nAllgaier made a comeback the next week at Martinsville, taking the lead late in the race, leading 4 laps and then finishing 17th. Allgaier finished 29th in the Cup Series standings for 2014 and 3rd in the Rookie of the Year standings behind Austin Dillon and Kyle Larson.\n\nAllgaier began his season with a crash in the Daytona 500. He rebounded at Phoenix three weeks later, running in the top ten late. After contact with Tony Stewart, Allgaier faded in the waning laps finishing 18th. The next week at Auto Club Speedway, Allgaier ran as high as 8th and finished 12th-his career best finish at the time. He scored his first top ten at Bristol in the No. 51, finishing 8th. He then finished 18th at Richmond after spending most of the race running as high as second, and while suffering from a stomach cramp. Allgaier had some good runs at short tracks such as the second Bristol race, and both Martinsville races but failed to record another top ten.\n\nOn October 2, 2015, it was announced that Allgaier parted ways with HScott Motorsports, and was replaced in 2016 by Clint Bowyer. On October 28, 2015, it was announced that Allgaier would take his sponsor Brandt to drive the No. 7 for JR Motorsports full-time in the Xfinity Series season in 2016, replacing Regan Smith.\n\nAllgaier finished 30th in the Cup Series standings, one spot short of matching his career-best season result.\n\nAfter talking to Dale Earnhardt Jr. during driver intros at Darlington Raceway in the same pickup truck, Allgaier formed a connection with Earnhardt and eventually signed to drive with JR Motorsports for the 2016 season. Allgaier started his season on a good note. While his teammate Chase Elliott won the season-opening PowerShares QQQ 300 at Daytona, Allgaier finished 12th. Allgaier picked up 2 top tens in the next 2 races at Atlanta and Las Vegas. He led 15 laps in Atlanta and finished 9th in Las Vegas. Allgaier had his best finish of the spring at Talladega during the Sparks Energy 300 in which he led 1 lap and took advantage of Joey Logano's final lap wreck to finish second behind his teammate Elliott Sadler, giving JRM a 1–2 finish.\n\nAllgaier appeared to have won the July race in Daytona. After passing Aric Almirola on the final lap, Allgaier led to the yellow-and-checkered flags to finish first. NASCAR determined that the yellow had flown with Almirola leading, dropping Allgaier to a second-runner up of the season while giving the win to Almirola. Allgaier later finished second yet again at the Food City 300 after passing Kyle Larson on the final lap to place second to Austin Dillon, his third runner-up finish of the season.\n\nOn August 20, Allgaier returned to the Cup Series to drive the No. 46 Chevrolet at the Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race, replacing former HScott teammate Michael Annett after he suffered from flu-like systems. Allgaier got into a crash with Kyle Busch when Allgaier wrecked at the same time as Busch. \"\n\nAllgaier made his Porsche GT3 Cup Brasil debut in 2016 as a co-driver for a team that is sponsored by his NASCAR Xfinity Series sponsor, Brandt Agriculture. He made two starts in the Brandt-sponsored No. 7 Porsche with Miguel Paludo as driver, both of which were in endurance races, the Goionia and Interlagos races.\n\nEven though he went winless throughout the whole season, he ended up finishing 3rd in the final standings behind Elliott Sadler and eventual champion Daniel Suarez.\n\nAllgaier continued with JR Motorsports for the 2017 NASCAR Xfinity Series. He led late in the DC Solar 200 at Phoenix and took the lead from Austin Dillon with less than 30 laps to go and held off Ryan Blaney on a final restart to win his first race in five years. With the win, Allgaier made the NASCAR playoffs and also picked up a bonus $100,000 in the Dash 4 Cash program. His second win of the season came at Chicagoland Speedway in September; it was the first time in his career he won more than once in a season. For the second year, Allgaier made the playoffs with his teammates Elliott Sadler, William Byron and Michael Annett and despite a 33rd-place finish at Charlotte in the playoffs, he finished 3rd in the final standings again while giving JR Motorsports a 1-2-3 finish in the standings for the first time with Allgaier finishing 3rd, Sadler finishing 2nd and Byron winning the championship.\n\nAllgaier finished seventh in his sole Porsche GT3 Cup Brasil start, at the season-ending Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace Interlagos 500 km round as a co-driver for Paludo.\n\nAllgaier returned in the No. 7 for the 2018 NASCAR Xfinity Series season. After three 2nd-place finishes at Phoenix, California and Bristol, he picked up his first win of the season at Dover after holding off teammate Elliott Sadler; However, he failed post-race inspection, leading to a 25-point penalty and losing 6 playoff points as well as the win not counting towards the playoffs. Later in the season, after two dismal finishes of 32nd and 37th at Charlotte and Pocono, he finished 9th in a rain-shortened race at Michigan, followed by a dominating performance at Iowa where he led the most laps and won both stages en route to his second win of the season. He then went on to earn his third win of the season at Mid-Ohio and at Road America two weeks later, he earned his fourth win of the season as well as inherited the points lead after Christopher Bell had issues near the end and two weeks later at Indianapolis Motor Speedway after the race was delayed two days due to rain, he led a race-high 41 laps en route to his 5th win of the season. A week later, Allgaier would win the 2018 Regular Season Championship. However he was eliminated in the Round of 8 after the seasons penultimate race at ISM Raceway and finished a 7th-place points finish.\n\nAllgaier finished fifth in his sole Porsche GT3 Cup Brasil start, again at Interlagos, again teaming with Paludo.\n\nAt Watkins Glen International in August, Ross Chastain sent Allgaier spinning off track in the bus stop section of the circuit. Allgaier, believing that the move was intentional, sent Chastain into the guardrail in that same portion of track later in the race, forcing Chastain out of the event. Chastain said that his end of the incident was a mistake on his part while Allgaier cited instances at Daytona earlier in 2019 and Las Vegas in 2019 as proof that Chastain was a dirty driver.\n\nAgain, Allgaier made starts in the Porsche GT3 Cup Brasil Endurance rounds as Paludo's co-driver when dates do not conflict. In the 2019 season, the dates were the Goiânia and Interlagos rounds. At Goiânia, Allgaier led during his stint midway through the 300 km race, but after handing the car back to Paludo for the final stint, Confederação Brasileira de Automobilismo officials black-flagged the team for Allgaier violating track limits when only two tires were below the pit entrance line; series rules require all four tires below it.\n\nAllgaier won the final race of the Round of 8 at Phoenix to advance to the Championship 4, his 3rd appearance in the last four years and 1st victory of the season after five 2nd-place finishes throughout the year. He finished the 2019 season fourth in points after finishing 14th at Homestead.\n\nAllgaier went to Lincoln Land Community College where he majored in engineering from 2004 to 2006.\n\nAllgaier is married, to Ashley, and they have one daughter.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

She is president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and a member of the AFL-CIO. She is the former president of the United Federation of Teachers.\n\nRhonda \"Randi\" Weingarten was born in 1957 in New York City, to a Jewish family, Gabriel and Edith (Appelbaum) Weingarten. Her father was an electrical engineer and her mother a teacher. Weingarten grew up in Rockland County, New York, and attended Clarkstown High School North in New City, New York. A congregant of Beth Simchat Torah synagogue, she considers herself a deeply religious Jew.\n\nWeingarten's interest in trade unions and political advocacy was formed during childhood. Her mother's union went on a seven-week strike when Weingarten was in the eleventh grade. Under New York state's Taylor Law, her mother could have been fired for taking part in a strike. Instead, she was fined two days' pay for every day she was on strike. Later that year, the school board cut $2 million from the budget. Weingarten and several other students convinced the school board to let them conduct a survey regarding the impact of the cuts. The survey led several school board members to change their minds, and rescind the cuts.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1980, Weingarten was a legislative assistant for the Labor Committee of the New York State Senate. She received a B.S. degree in labor relations from the ILR School at Cornell University in 1980 and a J.D. degree from the Yeshiva University Cardozo School of Law in 1983.\n\nWeingarten worked as a lawyer for the firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan from 1983 to 1986, where she handled several acrimonious arbitration cases on behalf of the UFT. She was appointed an adjunct instructor at the Cardozo School of Law in 1986. She also worked as an attorney in the real estate department of Wien Malkin and Bettex.\n\nIn 1986, Weingarten became counsel to Sandra Feldman, then-president of the UFT. Weingarten handled high-level grievances for the union. She was also lead counsel for the union in a number of lawsuits against New York City and the state of New York over school funding and school safety. By the early 1990s, she was the union's primary negotiator in UFT contract negotiations. Her negotiating positions became more aggressive throughout the 1990s.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1997 she taught at Clara Barton High School in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The classes she taught included Law, Ethical Issues in Medicine, AP Political Science, and US History and Government. Her political science students competed in the We the People civics competition, winning the state championship in 1993-94 and 1994–95 and being fourth in the national championship in 1994-95. In 1995, Weingarten was elected Assistant Secretary of the UFT. She continued teaching per diem from 1995 to 1997.\n\nElected the UFT's treasurer in 1997, Weingarten succeeded Sandra Feldman as president of the union a year later when Feldman was elected president of the national American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten was elected a Vice President of the AFT the same year.\n\nWeingarten was reelected by consistently wide margins after her initial appointment in 1998. The local union's constitution required her to run for the UFT presidency within a year of her appointment. She received 74 percent of the vote against two opponents in 1999, and served the final two years of Feldman's term. She ran in 2001 for a full term and was re-elected. She won her third full three-year term with more than 88 percent of the vote, despite having two opposing candidates. On March 30, 2007, Weingarten won reelection to a fourth term as UFT President, garnering 87 percent of the vote.\n\nWeingarten stepped down from her post as president of the United Federation of Teachers on July 31, 2009. An opinion piece in the \"New York Post\" on January 16, 2011, characterized Weingarten's final paycheck from the UFT—which included payments for unused vacation days and sick time—as a $194,188 \"golden parachute.\"\n\nWeingarten began negotiating her first contract as UFT president in 2000. Talks with the Giuliani administration began in early September 2000, but the contract expired on November 15, 2000 without a new agreement. By March 2001, the talks deadlocked and a state mediator was called in. Talks collapsed again on June 5, and Weingarten asked for state arbitration.\n\nTo pressure Giuliani, Weingarten endorsed Alan Hevesi in the Democratic primary. In the run-off between Green and Ferrer, Weingarten endorsed Ferrer, who lost to Green. Michael Bloomberg defeated Green in the November 2001 election. Weingarten demanded a 22 percent wage hike; Giuliani offered 8 percent. Talks collapsed on March 9, and Weingarten began preparing the UFT for its first strike since the early 1970s. In the state arbitration panel's mid-April report, it advocated a major salary boost and a longer work week. Both sides agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in June, raising wages 16 to 22 percent and lengthening the work week by 100 minutes.\n\nThe UFT's contract expired on May 31, 2003. Once again, negotiations proved contentious. In January 2004, New York City School Chancellor Joel Klein proposed a merit-pay deal; in February, Mayor Bloomberg proposed replacing the union's 200-page contract with an 8-page set of guidelines. Weingarten rejected these proposals, and asked for state mediation in late March 2004. In May, Weingarten agreed to discuss merit pay. The union began a public-relations campaign featuring subway and television ads demanding a contract and held protests and marches. On June 1, 2005, nearly 20,000 teachers—about a quarter of the UFT membership—packed Madison Square Garden for a rally at which Weingarten denounced Bloomberg and Klein, asked for a strike vote, and requested state arbitration. Contract talks resumed in August and September. A tentative contract was reached on October 3, 2005. The union won a wage increase of 14.25 percent over 52 months, retroactive to June 1, 2003. Other changes include a slightly longer workday (with the extra time devoted to tutoring) and the elimination of union control over some staffing decisions. The contract, ratified on November 3, 2005, passed with just 63 percent of UFT members in favor.\n\nWeingarten concluded her third collective bargaining agreement on November 6, 2006, when the union and city reached a tentative deal to increase pay by 7.1 percent over two years. The agreement raised base pay for senior teachers above $100,000 a year, bringing city salaries in line with those in New York City's suburbs for the first time. The city did not seek any increases in the work day or work load or any other concessions, as it had with other unions. Negotiations over health benefits were to be conducted separately in talks with the Municipal Labor Committee, an umbrella group for municipal unions which Weingarten chairs.\n\nObservers said Bloomberg sought an early contract in order to win UFT support in his struggle with Governor Eliot Spitzer over school funding. In October 2007, Weingarten assented to two agreements whereby the city and the UFT would jointly seek legislative approval for a new pension deal allowing teachers with 25 years of service to retire at age 55 and providing bonuses to all teachers in schools that showed a certain level of improvement in student achievement. In June 2009, Weingarten negotiated some pension modifications for new teachers in exchange for maintaining the age 55 pension and for allowing teachers to return to their traditional post-Labor Day start date.\n\nIn 2003, Weingarten sold the UFT's headquarters at 260 Park Avenue South and two other buildings at 48 and 49 East 21st Street for $63.6 million and moved the union's offices to Lower Manhattan, purchasing a building at 50 Broadway for $53.75 million and leasing the building next to it, 52 Broadway, for 32 years. The UFT also financed a $40 million renovation of both buildings.\n\nThe UFT represents all teachers, paraprofessional school employees, and professionals (such as school nurses, school psychologists, and others) in the New York City schools. The UFT saw some membership growth under Weingarten among these workers.\n\nThe UFT also has a registered nurse division which represents roughly 2,800 registered nurses at Lutheran Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital-South, Jewish Home and Hospital Home Health Agency, and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. The UFT saw more growth in this division, as the Visiting Nurse Service expanded and the union organized non-RN units at the non-profit company.\n\nWeingarten's largest organizing victory came when the UFT organized child care providers in New York City. The campaign began in 2005, and concluded in 2007. The organizing drive—the largest successful union campaign in the city since 1960, when the United Federation of Teachers itself was formed—added 28,000 workers to the union's 113,000 active and 56,000 retired members.\n\nOn February 12, 2008, AFT President Edward J. McElroy announced he would retire at the union's regularly scheduled biennial convention in July. On July 14, Weingarten was elected to succeed him. She is the first openly gay individual to be elected president of a national American labor union. In her first year, she fought for resources to keep schools and other public institutions afloat during the ongoing fiscal crises, and started an AFT Innovation Fund to promote and disseminate innovative educational reforms by teachers and their union.\n\nWeingarten advocates what she describes as a \"bottom up\" approach to education reform, and says that public officials should welcome the views—and account for the needs—of teachers when working to help schools better serve their students. She has, as AFT president, criticized state and federal reforms proposed by her opponents.\n\nThe AFT, during Weingarten's presidency, has focused scrutiny on well-funded third parties that have attempted to influence education policy—with the Walton Foundation, the largest philanthropic donor in the United States, drawing particular scrutiny. In a 2015 report co-authored with In the Public Interest, the AFT decried the Walton Foundation's pursuit of what the report termed a \"market-based model [that] will lead to ... the eventual elimination of public education altogether, in favor of an across-the-board system of privately operated schools.\"\n\nWeingarten was among nineteen arrested in March 2013 while protesting a Philadelphia School Reform Commission meeting on school closures.\n\nNeighborhood public schools, according to Weingarten, can coexist with charter schools—but she opposes initiatives that work to supplant the former with the latter. Weingarten sees the role of charters as complementary to, rather than competing with, other schools.\n\n\"Charter schools should be laboratories for innovation and creative ideas that can be scaled up so they can enrich communities,\" she has said.\n\nIn a 2013 debate in New Haven, Weingarten argued that charter schools pull money from regular school districts.\n\nWeingarten condemns a \"fixation on testing and data over everything else\" as \"a fundamental flaw in how our nation approaches public education,\" but accepts the use of standardized tests as one tool among several to evaluate student achievement and teacher performance. As AFT president, she has criticized the No Child Left Behind Act for \"allow[ing] high-stakes testing to eclipse all else, including the children themselves.\" In a 2015 opinion essay for the New York Times, she wrote:\n\nTests should be used to get teachers, parents and school communities the information they need to help students make progress — not to sanction or scapegoat, as they do now with high-stakes tests driving federal education policy. Instead, we need investments to level the playing field for kids, boost innovation, elevate the teaching profession and support educators.\n\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (ESSA) passed into law with the AFT's support. The law eliminates the federal requirement that states evaluate teachers according to their students' standardized test scores, and allows states to weigh factors in addition to test scores when judging the performance of school systems. Weingarten has applauded the ESSA for \"relegating the era of test-and-punish strategies to the trash heap\" and for offering \"teachers ... flexibility to try new ways to teach, to meet the needs of their students, and to help their students think critically and analytically instead of focusing on what might be on a high-stakes test.\" As AFT president, Weingarten favored the act particularly because of provisions that stripped the United States Secretary of Education's role in influencing teacher-evaluation systems and maintained federal funding Title I for schools with high proportions of students from low-income households.\n\nAn overemphasis on standardized testing and a shortage of resources, according to Weingarten, has harmed efforts to recruit and retain well-prepared teachers at public schools. \"A haphazard approach to the complex and crucial enterprise of educating children,\" she has written, \"[is] unfair to both students and teachers, who want and need to be well-prepared to teach from their first day on the job.\" In response to a \"New York Times\" story about public school systems short of teaching staff, she said that \"teachers are used to the pressure cooker but are stressed out because they aren't getting the support, resources, time and respect they need to do their jobs.\"\n\nWeingarten has proposed—as a means of improving the quality of teachers in American classrooms—the creation of a professional licensing exam, akin to the bar exam taken by lawyers, for new teachers. \"Better preparing teachers for entry into the profession,\" Weingarten says, \"will dramatically reduce the loss of new teachers—nearly half of whom leave after fewer than five years—and the loss of knowledge that goes with it.\"\n\nThe AFT, under Weingarten's leadership, has worked to draw attention to economic inequalities within cities and regions that can hobble public schools. With school systems in the United States heavily reliant on local property taxes, systems that rely on depressed or depleted tax bases can find themselves without the financial resources available to comparatively wealthier districts.\n\nPhilanthropic efforts in public schools, in Weingarten's view, have incorrectly focused on the educator's role in student performance—\"what we now know is 10% of student achievement,\" she remarked in one interview—to the exclusion of underlying problems, such as poverty, that undermine student progress. \"We need to ... treat kids that have the least, give them the most,\" says Weingarten—\"not with a blank check, but actually figure out the supports they need so that they can climb up the ladder of opportunity.\"\n\nDuring Weingarten's presidency, the AFT has pushed for creating what the union calls \"community schools\": schools that serve as hubs for non-academic programs addressed to whole communities. Undergirding that concept is the understanding—as described by former Boston Public Schools superintendent Thomas W. Payzant, who implemented a community-school model in the city, in a 2005 book—that \"students' noneducational realities, such as nutritional deficiencies, medical problems, safety concerns, even daily hunger, are daunting barriers that can obstruct even the most flexible educational program.\"\n\nTo address those perceived needs, community schools offer 'wraparound services' that target identified social issues: job banks to help parents secure employment, for example, or housing counseling for families that lack permanent homes. In a 2008 address given during her first run for the AFT presidency, Weingarten said, in the course of promoting the community-school paradigm:\n\nImagine schools that are open all day and offer after-school and evening recreational activities, child care and preschool, tutoring and homework assistance. Schools that include dental, medical and counseling clinics ... Imagine if schools had the educational resources children need to thrive, like smaller classes and individualized instruction, plentiful, up-to-date materials and technology anchored to that rich curriculum, decent facilities, an early start for toddlers and a nurturing atmosphere.\n\nThe AFT has extolled community schools that operate in Philadelphia, Cincinnati, St. Paul, Minn., Austin, Texas, Providence, R.I., and other cities where the union represents public schoolteachers. The union has itself sponsored community school efforts in Chicago, and in West Virginia, the AFT has launched a public-private partnership—called Reconnecting McDowell—that aims to \"enhance educational opportunity for children in the McDowell County public schools in Central Appalachia, while addressing the underlying problems caused by severe and chronic poverty and economic decline.\" Efforts through the program have included the building of a \"teacher village\" for educators, setup of an internship program for high-school students, and mentoring of students from families in which they would be the first to attend college.\n\nWeingarten has resisted attempts to curtail or eliminate tenure protections for public-school teachers, arguing that the outright removal of tenure protection would hurt the quality of classroom instruction. \"We know that the states with the highest academic performance have the strongest due process protections for teachers,\" Weingarten wrote to \"Time\" magazine in 2014. \"Research shows that our most at-risk kids need more-experienced teachers. But why would these teachers stay at schools with few tools, little support and no ability to voice their concerns?\"\n\nEducation policy proposals built around eliminating tenure have drawn derision from Weingarten as \"faddish reforms\" at the expense of what she terms \"the most critical issues confronting American education\": teacher training, education funding, school safety, and educational reinforcement at home. She downplays the idea of worker protections as obstacles to improving schools, describing tenure \"not a job for life, [but] ensuring fairness and due process before someone can be fired, plain and simple.\"\n\nWhen United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan issued a statement siding with a California superior court judge who ruled the state's teacher tenure protections unconstitutional, Weingarten responded that Duncan had \"added to the polarization\" in debates over education policy, and charged that focusing on \"quick fixes, blame games or silver bullets\" such as ending tenure had \"set us back in our effort to help all kids succeed.\" The AFT has worked, however, to reshape tenure in some states. In 2011 Weingarten offered a plan that would rely on a teacher-evaluation system with multiple parts—including assessment of student improvement on tests—to give tenured teachers rated unsatisfactory one year to improve, and allow the firing of teachers who fail to meet that deadline within the next 100 days. The proposal followed a 2008 agreement between Weingarten and District of Columbia public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee that allowed the termination of Washington Teachers' Union members evaluated as ineffective, after a one-year period—and in public remarks, Weingarten has discussed her role in efforts to modernize tenure elsewhere.\n\nUnder Weingarten, the AFT has combatted efforts to shift responsibility for retirement investing to teachers—with Weingarten herself drawing notoriety, according to \"Institutional Investor\" magazine, as \"the most public face in the battle for defined benefit pension funds.\" In a 2014 op-ed, Weingarten attacked \"people who press ... to convert defined benefit pensions to 401(k) plans,\" asserting that advocates of 401(k) plans \"never talk about the benefits retirees are likely to get under these new plans — because it's likely to be a lot less than retirees need to get by.\"\n\nIn its campaign against moving teachers into defined-contribution pensions, AFT has argued that shifting investment risks to individuals has led to deleterious results for retirees. Hedge funds that manage teacher pension investments have drawn heavy criticism from AFT; the union, in 2015, prepared a report that concluded such investments \"exacted a high cost, had laggard returns and generally moved in tandem with the overall stock market.\" The report came in the wake of a 2013 AFT study that charged some hedge-fund managers with a conflict of interest—according to \"BuzzFeed\", the 2013 report said that while managing teachers' defined benefit pensions, some fund managers had \"support[ed] groups like the Manhattan Institute, which has recommended replacing pensions with 401(k)-type plans, and Students First, whose national branch advocates eliminating defined-benefit plans.\"\n\nWeingarten and the UFT endorsed George Pataki for re-election as Governor of New York in 2002. Julia Levy reported in the \"New York Sun\" on February 1, 2005, that candidates for mayor of New York were meeting with Weingarten, and \"political experts\" were saying that \"Weingarten has become something of a kingmaker.\" The UFT's endorsement, wrote Levy, meant \"votes, campaign volunteers, and information.\"\n\nA lifelong Democrat, Weingarten is a member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). She was an early and critically important supporter of Howard Dean as Chairman of the DNC. She is a superdelegate who was pledged to Hillary Clinton during the 2008 presidential primary. In January 2009, she was mentioned as a possible candidate in the appointment process to replace Clinton's U.S. Senate seat.\n\nIn one of the Wikileaks emails from John Podesta, chair of the Hillary Clinton campaign, Weingarten states her desire to \"go after\" the National Nurses United union after their endorsement of Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States.\n\nIn spring 1998 in the \"City Journal\", the quarterly magazine of the conservative Manhattan Institute think tank, Sol Stern dismissed Weingarten's claim to support school reform as \"pure union propaganda.\"\n\nCarl Campanile reported in the January 21, 2004, \"New York Post\" that Weingarten had called for union members to voice concerns by sending e-mails to the schools chancellor, Joel Klein, and Mayor Bloomberg \"about the micromanagement and mismanagement issues that make your job more difficult this year.\"\n\nPundit John Stossel wrote, in an opinion piece in the conservative \"New York Sun\", about a rally held by Weingarten at Madison Square Garden at which teachers demanded \"a new contract and more money.\" Stossel said that the teachers unions \"can pay for expensive rallies at 'the world's most famous arena' because every teacher in a unionized district like New York must give up some of his salary to the union. Even teachers who don't like the union, teachers who believe in school choice, and teachers who could make more on the open market must fork over their money to support the unions that fight against school choice and merit pay.\" Calling the present situation in New York schools a nightmare, Stossel wrote that \"the unions fight to protect the nightmare\" and mocked Weingarten's promise that the UFT would \"police our own profession\" with \"I'd like to police my own job, too. And I'll bet some students would just love to police their own homework!\" He accused Weingarten of \"protect[ing] incompetents\" and \"reward[ing] mediocrity.\" He said that he had \"confronted Weingarten,\" telling her, \"Unionized monopolies like yours fail. In this case, it is the children who - who you are failing.\" She replied by rejecting the label \"unionized monopoly\" and by saying that her critics \"don't really care about kids.\"\n\nThe editorial board of the \"New York Post\" wrote, on February 28, 2007, about a planned gathering of opponents of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's public-school reform efforts, describing some of the participants as \"a bought-and-paid-for chorus of false reformers\" who \"dance to the tunes of Randi Weingarten ... who has been trying to derail real reform since Mayor Mike wrested control of the schools from the educrats some five years ago.\" Calling the UFT \"one of the richest special interests in America\", the editorial board maintained that Weingarten does not care \"about New York's schoolchildren\" but is loyal \"to her members.\"\n\nIn an opinion piece in the conservative \"New York Sun\", Andrew Wolf wrote that Mayor Bloomberg had called the UFT the \"number one\" obstacle to education reform, but had reached a compromise with a coalition including the UFT, ACORN, and the Working Families Party. Wolf said that Weingarten, speaking to parent groups in a conference call, had called Department of Education officials \"absolute and complete assholes\" who \"can't be trusted.\"\n\nOn September 30, 2009, in the conservative \"City Journal\", Sol Stern asserted that \"the UFT and the Bloomberg administration [had] increasingly developed a cartel-like working relationship, with New York taxpayers paying the price.\"\nThe editorial board of \"The New York Post\" said on June 2, 2009, that Weingarten, \"who'd previously vowed to gut City Hall's control over the schools,\" had now \"delivered a nearly full-throated endorsement of it,\" reflecting her recognition of the \"sweeping, and undeniable\" progress in test scores of elementary-school pupils,\n\nReacting on July 7, 2009, to Weingarten's statement, upon taking control of the AFT, that New York City is \"the best laboratory in the world for trying new things,\" the conservative editorial board of \"The Wall Street Journal\" asserted this could be true \"if it weren't for Ms. Weingarten's union,\" and wrote that the UFT under her direction had done everything possible \"to block significant reforms to New York's public schools.\"\n\nIn a 2009 essay by Steven Brill in The New Yorker, New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein was quoted as calling the teacher tenure policies defended by the UFT \"ridiculous\"—with Klein asserting that \"the three principles that govern our system are lockstep compensation, seniority, and tenure. All three are not right for our children.\" Brill attributed to \"many education reformers\" the belief \"that the U.F.T. and its political allies had gained so much clout\" over the years \"that it had become impossible for the city's Board of Education, which already shared a lot of power with local boards, to maintain effective school oversight.\" However, Brill later reversed his view of Weingarten, and proposed that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg appoint her chancellor of the school system.\n\nDuring her tenure as UFT president, Weingarten pushed for higher salaries and improved training for teachers, often agreeing to longer work days and more tutoring time in order to win better pay. Between 2002 and 2007, salaries for New York City teachers rose 42 percent. Weingarten has endorsed merit pay for city teachers, and in 2007 negotiated a controversial contract which paid teachers bonuses if their students' test scores rose.\n\nNicole Gelinas wrote in the conservative \"City Journal\" on June 16, 2005, that \"Weingarten declared that merit-pay plans 'pit teachers against each other instead of encouraging a collaborative school culture.' What Weingarten and the union do not see ... is that competition is healthy.\" Gelinas went on to assert that \"until Weingarten budges ... virtue will have to be its own reward for New York's teachers.\"\n\nIn an opinion column on June 14, 1999, Bob McManus asserted that \"67 percent of New York City's fourth-graders\" had \"turned up functionally illiterate in state tests in May,\" and that the response from the UFT was to call for \"more 'classroom resources' (i.e., Big League raises).\" McManus argued that \"there's more to this crisis than money—or the lack of it,\" and called on Weingarten to \"get out of the way of folks who believe they can get the job done for less.\"\n\nAndrew Wolf, in an October 19, 2007, op-ed in the \"New York Sun\" entitled \"Socialism for Schools,\" argued that despite some observers' perception that \"Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Klein [had] won a victory over the teachers' union by gaining approval of a merit pay scheme,\" the real winner was Weingarten, who had gained power for the UFT. The new plan, Wolf asserted, did not reward individual performance but treated each school as a collective, with union committees dividing bonuses among all union members, including school secretaries and others.\n\nIn October 2012, after what the \"New York Times\" called \"months of intense and late-night negotiations,\" Weingarten and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie reached a \"landmark compromise,\" agreeing on a new contract for teachers in the Newark school system. Although, as the \"Times\" noted, Weingarten \"had criticized what she calls 'merit pay schemes,'\" she \"agreed to embrace the concept in exchange for a promise that teachers would have a rare role in evaluating performance.\" After this agreement was reached, supporters of merit pay for New York City public-school teachers expressed hope that the UFT, which had \"always opposed individual merit pay initiatives,\" would now follow Weingarten's example.\n\nAlso in 2012, Weingarten criticized what she calls \"merit pay schemes\".\n\nIn 2009, when New York state Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan said that she had been prevented by a hip injury from introducing a measure to form a commission to study teacher-tenure reform—which the UFT had agreed to as a compromise measure—the \"New York Post\" editorialized that the legislative inaction which resulted \"ha[d] the United Federation of Teachers chief's fingerprints all over it.\" The Post argued that Nolan had managed to pass \"77 other education bills ... while she was out for surgery,\" and called it likely that Weingarten had influenced Nolan's decision.\n\nIn a February 2011 interview, Weingarten acknowledged that \"tenure needs to be reformed,\" noting that the AFT had adopted recommendations for tenure reform. Observing that the issue of teacher tenure had \"erupted recently, with many districts anticipating layoffs because of slashed budgets\" and with mayors such as Michael R. Bloomberg in New York City and Cory A. Booker in Newark \"attack[ing] seniority laws,\" the \"New York Times\" reported that Weingarten had agreed to support some kind of tenure reform.\n\nWeingarten has strongly supported defined-benefit pension plans for teachers. Sol Stern argued in the conservative \"City Journal\" on June 25, 2009, that an agreement reached between Weingarten and the Bloomberg administration on teacher pensions would \"probably wind up harming Gotham's students.\" Under the agreement, Stern asserted, teachers would \"make no sacrifices to help ease the city's economic and fiscal crisis\" and would even get \"a shorter work year,\" with a ten-and-a-half-week summer vacation.\n\nIn April 2013, Weingarten organized an action to confront Dan Loeb—a New York investment manager and board member of the New York chapter of lobbying organization StudentsFirst—over his opposition to defined-benefit pension plans for public employees. In the same month, the \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board painted Weingarten as \"trying to strong-arm pension trustees not to invest in hedge funds or private-equity funds that support education reform.\" Weingarten had, according to the editorial board, \"tried to sandbag hedge fund investor Dan Loeb at a conference sponsored by the Council of Institutional Investors,\" describing her as troubled by the fact \"that Mr. Loeb puts his own money behind school reform and charter schools.\"\n\nWeingarten had, according to the Journal editorial, demanded a meeting with Loeb at the conference, but the editorial board wrote that he had \"wisely declined the honor of showing up for this political mugging.\" This \"attempted ambush,\" continued the \"Journal\" editorial, \"coincide[d] with a new report that her union sent to pension trustees this week called 'Ranking Asset Managers,'\" with the rankings based not on \"return on investment\" but on such matters \"as a manager's position on collective bargaining, privatization [read: vouchers] or proposals to discontinue providing benefits through defined benefit plans.\" The editorial board imputed \"Ms. Weingarten's union fury\" to her \"know[ing that] unions are losing the moral and political debate over reform, as more Americans conclude that her policies are consigning millions of children to a life of diminished opportunity.\" Weingarten had \"bull[ied] pension trustees to bully hedge funds,\" the editorial board charged, \"to cut off funding for poor kids in Harlem. Every time we wonder if we're too cynical about unions, they remind us that we're not nearly cynical enough.\"\n\nWeingarten has opposed charter schools and 'school choice'.\nIn a \"City Journal\" essay in 1999, Sol Stern contrasted \"Milwaukee's healthy approach to school choice\" with what he termed Weingarten's promise to \"fight with every resource at [her] disposal any attempt by the mayor to create a voucher system\" in New York. Given what Stern described as the UFT's \"impressive\" resources, he deemed Mayor Giuliani courageous to take on \"what promises to be,\" Stern opined, \"a long fight for the beleaguered parents of New York's schoolchildren.\"\n\nWriting about a 1999 Emergency Coalition Against Vouchers \"teach-in\" attended by Weingarten, Stern asserted that \"calling the rally ... a teach-in was almost Orwellian. Despite the nostalgic references to the Sixties,\" Stern continued, \"this event was the antithesis of insurgency.\" Weingarten, he alleged, had made it clear that whatever the wishes of parents and the public, she \"had the political clout to block even a tiny experimental voucher plan.\"\n\nIn a February 6, 2007, op-ed in the \"New York Post\", Thomas W. Carroll of an advocacy organization called the Foundation for Education Reform & Accountability charged that Weingarten sought to unionize charter schools against the will of the teachers at those schools. To this end, Carroll wrote, Weingarten had tried pursue a unionization process known as card check, which involves the gathering signatures from pro-union teachers in lieu of a unionization vote by secret ballot. According to Carroll's op-ed, Weingarten had claimed that teachers had been fired from charter schools for wanting a union, but lacked the evidence to prove \"these wild allegations.\"\n\nIn an April 10, 2009, article, \"The New York Post\" asserted that UFT activists had \"sought to push City Council members into grilling Department of Education officials during a hearing on charter schools ... while taking it easy on union officials.\" When those efforts—described by the article as \"puppeteering\"— became public, Weingarten told WNYW that she would \"make some changes at the union to make sure that that never happens again\" and said that former City Council Education Committee Chairwoman Eva Moskowitz, who had criticized the UFT's actions, \"used to ask us all the time, when she was education chair, for questions to prep the City Council about what's really going on in schools.\" Moskowitz, who after leaving the council had become founder and CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools, called Weingarten's charge \"utterly false\" and \"defamatory.\"\n\nThe editorial board of the \"New York Post\" wrote, on August 6, 2011, about a PowerPoint presentation by an AFT lobbyist that \"underscore[d] the sharp disparity between the union's public posture and its actual policies.\" The presentation, according to the editorial's retelling, had \"detailed how the union successfully rebuffed efforts\" in Connecticut to enact a parent trigger law designed to let parents to \"reconstitute a consistently failing school into a charter school.\" After the presentation was made public, the editorial observed, an AFT statement said that the presentation did \"not represent AFT's position.\" The editorial quoted Gwen Samuel of the Connecticut Parents Union, a pro-parent trigger advocacy organization, saying: \"I'm concerned that they [AFT] were so bold. This screams, 'I'm untouchable.'\"\n\nThe editorial board of the \"New York Post\" wrote on October 8, 2012, that the film \"Won't Back Down\"—a fictionalized account of a parent-trigger takeover at a neighborhood public school—had drawn what the editorial termed \"the acid-laced enmity\" of Weingarten, who had accused the film of employing \"the most blatant stereotypes and caricatures I have ever seen\" and of placing blame for failing schools \"on the wrong culprit: America's teachers unions.\" AFT members protested outside the film's premiere, the editorial noted. Rich Lowry, the editor of the conservative National Review, opined in the \"Post\" that Weingarten objected to the film not because its characters were, as she described them, stereotypes, but because \"they are revelations.\"\n\nWeingarten has been frequently criticized over the years for resisting attempts to address the problem of teacher incompetence. When New York schools Chancellor Joel Klein announced a new peer-review process in 2007 to identify bad teachers, Weingarten called the plan \"a stake in the heart of every teacher.\"\n\nThe editors of the \"New York Sun\" noted on September 17, 2007, that Weingarten, when asked on a talk show about teacher accountability, replied: \"When people say to me, you know, well, why shouldn't teachers be, you know, judged on the test scores of their kids? I say to them ... would you want your oncologist, or your mom or dad's oncologist to be graded on the survival rates of his or her patients?\" The \"Sun's\" editors noted that doctors are, in fact, \"held accountable for performance. ... Would that teachers were held to such standards as exist in the oncology ward.\"\n\nThe \"New York Post\" noted on January 22, 2008, that \"Weingarten promised a full-arsenal fight if the Department of Education attempts to judge individual teachers based on their students' test scores.\"\n\nRegarding a new pilot program to determine teacher effectiveness, Weingarten commented in 2008: \"There are so many educational and technical flaws in this concept that I find it shocking that the school system is even considering it.\"\n\nEditorializing about Weingarten's acceptance speech at the 2008 AFT convention, the \"New York Post\" commented that she had \"laid out her vision for 'community schools' that do everything but, well, teach.\" The Post described her as envisioning a \"one-stop nanny state ... owned and operated by Randi Weingarten & Co.\" and suggested that her \"push for all-purpose schools\" was a way of \"dodg[ing] teacher accountability in the one area schools are built for – teaching kids how to read, write and do numbers.\"\n\nWriting in the \"New Yorker\" on August 31, 2009, Steven Brill quoted a school principal as saying that Weingarten \"would protect a dead body in the classroom.\"He quoted a teacher who had been suspended for incompetence, and who still earned over a hundred thousand dollars a year, as complaining that \"Before Bloomberg and Klein took over, there was no such thing as incompetence.\"\n\nUnited States Education Secretary Arne Duncan was scheduled to hold a press conference at PS 65 in Brooklyn on May 18, 2010, but after Weingarten made a call to Duncan complaining about the school's principal, Daysi Garcia, Duncan changed the press-conference venue. The \"New York Post\" editorialized that it was \"no surprise that Garcia is the sort of principal Weingarten can't abide,\" given that Garcia \"makes her teachers work — and she demands results.\" The \"Post\" cited a \"New Yorker\" article which had reported that Garcia had dared to identify and remove incompetent teachers, and consequently turned the school around, improving reading and math scores dramatically. The \"Post\" suggested that the lessons here were that \"It's not just charter schools that get the union's goat — it's any school that gives kids a decent education by holding teachers accountable\" and that \"The union will fight to the very end.\"\n\nWriting on May 30, 2013, about efforts to get \"New York state's teachers unions to accept personal accountability as a bedrock principle of public-education reform,\" Bob McManus of the \"New York Post\" commented that Weingarten \"once seemed to have a conscience on such matters — but no more,\" adhering to the principle that \"No tenured teacher, under any circumstances, is to be held to account for any failing of any sort.\"\n\nNew York City schools chancellor Dennis M. Walcott wrote on September 6, 2013, that the Board of Education had managed, despite resistance by the UFT, to establish \"an accountability system that included qualitative reviews and Progress Reports,\" to end \"the absurd practice of promoting students to higher grades if they lacked the skills to succeed,\" and to institute \"the first genuine teacher-evaluation system in the history of the school system.\"\n\nWeingarten has been a severe critic of proposals to allow parents to use tax credits to help pay to send their children to private school. The editors of the \"New York Sun\" on November 21, 2006, quoted Weingarten's statement that allowing parents to apply tax credits to private-school tuition was \"like saying government should reimburse people who drink bottled water instead of tap water — or those who park in a garage even when there is space on the street,\" the editors of the \"New York Sun\" argued on November 21, 2006, that \"bottled water and garage parking are luxuries, more expensive than tap water or street parking,\" while educating a child in a New York Catholic school, for example, costs one-quarter as much as educating a public-school student.\n\nSmaller class sizes have also been a major initiative of the UFT under Weingarten. She attempted to tie smaller class sizes to salaries in each of the three collective bargaining agreements she has negotiated, and linked class size to school repair and rebuilding issues. In 2003, Weingarten and the UFT pushed for a change to the New York City Charter which would force the city to reduce class sizes. The charter revision became caught in lawsuits and was eventually dropped, although Weingarten continued to advocate for smaller class sizes.\n\nA \"New York Sun\" editorial on May 20, 2003, questioned Weingarten's focus on this issue and challenged her argument that class size is a critical factor in learning, noting that \"America has been reducing class sizes steadily for the last half century, with little to show in results.\"\n\nWeingarten has been a staunch supporter of the LIFO policy (\"last in, first out\"), otherwise known as teacher seniority. When Education Secretary Arne Duncan changed a February 2011 speech at the last minute to remove a negative reference to the LIFO policy, under which the last teacher to be hired must be the first one fired, the \"New York Post\" editorialized that the action \"has the fingerprints of Randi Weingarten and the American Federation of Teachers all over it.\" Asked in a 2011 \"Wall Street Journal\" interview about LIFO, Weingarten defended it, saying: \"It's not the perfect mechanism but it's the best mechanism we have. You have cronyism and corruption and discrimination issues. We're saying let's do things the right way. We don't want to see people getting laid off based on who they know instead of what they know. We don't want to see people get laid off based on how much they cost.\"\n\nPoor schooling conditions, namely run-down public schools, have also drawn Weingarten's attention. The city of New York has neglected building conditions for many years.\n\nIn an October 5, 2007, \"New York Sun\" article, Eliot Brown wrote that a new Bronx apartment complex would be open only to UFT members: \"Our members have said we want to live in the city and raise our families in the city, but we can't afford it, so this is something we've been looking at for a while,\" Weingarten said.\n\nIn December 2007, Weingarten cancelled the subsidized-housing deal after discovering that the developer would not be using unionized construction workers. Unions, she said, \"should be standing up for each other.\" \"The New York Post\" commented that \"it clearly doesn't occur to Weingarten that using non-union labor is a major reason developers can build 'affordable' apartments\" and that \"she is imperilling a project that is beneficial to her teacher constituency for the 'greater good' of the broader labor movement.\" \"The Post\" noted that Weingarten, in addition to running the UFT, \"also chairs the Municipal Labor Committee – an umbrella group of more than 100 city unions.\" Observing that because of her solidarity, \"200 or so teachers may lose out on inexpensive apartments and – if the project falls through – several jobs won't be created at all,\" \"the Post\" alluded to the \"biblical adage ... that a man can't serve two masters.\"\n\nSol Stern wrote in the Summer 1998 issue of City Journal about Weingarten's opposition to a proposed dress code for teachers, calling it \"a diversion from the real job at hand.\"\n\n\"The New York Post\" criticized Weingarten in a February 6, 2013, editorial for signing on to a report by a coalition of unions and other groups calling for a range of new regulations to govern foreign workers. \"We're not surprised the AFT is on board,\" the Post commented. \"If you think of our public schools primarily as a jobs program, it makes perfect sense.\"\n\nA speech that Weingarten gave in 2011 turned out to have been plagiarized from a NY 1 series on a flawed Board of Education computer system. NY 1 responded, saying \"When a journalist, politician or student uses someone else's words without attribution in a speech or a paper, it's called plagiarism – and it's often enough to get a journalist fired, a politician embarrassed or a student kicked out of school\".\n\nIn 2010, the AFT and Weingarten specifically were charged with interfering in the local elections of the Washington Teachers Union (WTU). The elections had been scheduled for May but postponed because of a dispute over procedural questions. In August of that year, Weingarten imposed a deadline on WTU President George Parker to comply with an order \"to hold a mid-September election for new officers and delegates, or the contest will be taken out of his hands and conducted by the national parent organization.\" Parker objected that Weingarten had no authority to interfere in this manner. Weingarten ultimately took over the election.\n\nOn October 11, 2007, Weingarten publicly announced she is a lesbian. Weingarten introduced Liz Margolies, 54, a psychotherapist and health care activist, as her partner while accepting the Empire State Pride Agenda's 2007 Community Service Award from Christine Quinn. By December 2012, she was in a relationship with Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah. They married March 25, 2018.\n\nIn December 2014, Weingarten wrote in \"Jezebel\" that she had almost been raped just after her junior year in college.\n\n"}

Hot Pockets was founded by the Chef America Inc. company. Since April 20, 2002, they have been produced by Nestlé.\n\nThere are 50 varieties of the traditional Hot Pocket, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner varieties. Nestlé also offers Lean Pockets, Pretzel Bread Hot Pockets, Hot Pockets Croissant Crust (formerly called Croissant Pockets), Hot Pockets Breakfast items, Hot Pockets Breakfast/Snack Bites, and Hot Pockets Side shots. Nestlé formerly produced Hot Pie Express, Hot Pocket Pizza Minis (originally called Hot Pockets Pizza Snacks), Hot Pockets Subs, Hot Pockets Calzones, Hot Pockets Panini, and Hot Pockets Breakfast fruit pastries. Hot Pockets are viewed as \"an after school staple\".\n\nIndividual Hot Pockets contain about 350 calories.\n\nHot Pockets were developed by Paul Merage and his brother David through their company Chef America Inc. Chef America invented a packaging sleeve and dough formula to keep its calzone-like sandwiches crispy when cooked in a microwave. In 1980, Chef America introduced its first stuffed sandwich, the Tastywich, the predecessor of the Hot Pocket. Hot Pockets supplanted Tastywiches in 1983, first sold to restaurants because they were easier to break into than retail stores. On May 22, 2002, Chef America was sold to Nestlé. Hot Pocket products were \"a $2 billion category of frozen sandwiches and snacks\". Breakfast-style Hot Pockets were introduced in 2001.\n\nCiting reduced sales, in 2011 Nestlé announced that it would cut employee numbers at its California factory. U.S. sales were about $610 million in 2010—down $44 million from the previous year—according to Euromonitor International data.\n\nPaul Grimwood took over Nestlé SA's struggling U.S operations in 2011. In an attempt to bolster the failing brand by improving supply chain, Grimwood made the decision to drop the calzone version of Hot Pockets and the quesadillas Lean Pockets, reducing the number of doughs needed. Nestlé executive Chris Johnson points to an end of extended SNAP benefits in 2013 as the cause of the fallen sales, stating SNAP benefit recipients are \"a big part of the consumption of this particular product.\"\n\n\nIn 2014, Nestle USA recalled 238,000 cases of its Hot Pockets because they may have contained meat from a massive recall of about of meat from \"diseased and unsound\" animals. Nestle stated that \"a small quantity of meat\" from the Rancho Feeding Corp was used to make Hot Pockets. The USDA described the food as \"unfit for humans\". This Rancho Feeding Corp meat recall was based out of a production facility in California, but the recalled Hot Pockets were distributed nationwide. The two types of Hot Pockets involved in the recall were the Philly Steak and Cheese and the Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese. A full federal inspection was not performed, and there were no illnesses reported in connection to this recall. Customers who bought the recalled products were refunded by contacting Nestle Consumer Service.\n\n"}

It is thought to date from 1400 and was collected in 1868 by Francis James Child, as Child Ballad number 78. One of the more common tunes used for the ballad is the same as that used for the English ballad \"Dives and Lazarus\" and the Irish pub favorite \"Star of the County Down\".\n\nA man mourns his true love for \"a twelve month and a day\". At the end of that time, the dead woman complains that his weeping is keeping her from peaceful rest. He begs a kiss. She tells him it would kill him. When he persists, wanting to join her in death, she explains that once they were both dead their hearts would simply decay, and that he should enjoy life while he has it.\n\nThe version noted by Cecil Sharp ends with \"When will we meet again? / When the autumn leaves that fall from the trees / Are green and spring up again.\"\n\nMany verses in this ballad have parallels in other ballads: \"Bonny Bee Hom\", \"Sweet William's Ghost\" and some variants of \"The Twa Brothers\".\n\nThe motif that excessive grief can disturb the dead is found also in German and Scandinavian ballads, as well as Greek and Roman traditions.\n\nWeen plays a version featuring a woman weeping for a dead man, on their 1997 album \"The Mollusk\" entitled \"Cold Blows the Wind\".

It is a member of the Fraser Valley Regional District; its immediate neighbour is the District of Kent and included in it, the town of Agassiz. It is a resort community known for its hot springs, and has a population of just over 1500 people. It is named after Benjamin Harrison, a former deputy governor for the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nThe Village of Harrison Hot Springs has been a small resort community since 1886, when the opening of the Canadian Pacific Railway brought the lakeside springs within a short carriage ride of the transcontinental mainline. In its first promotion as a resort it was known as St. Alice's Well, although it had been discovered decades earlier when a party of goldfield-bound travellers on Harrison Lake capsized into what they thought was their doom, only to discover the lake at that spot was not freezing, but warm.\n\nAlthough the resort flourished in a low-key fashion for years after this discovery was exploited by hoteliers, the Village of Harrison Hot Springs was not incorporated until 1949. Its namesake hot springs are a major attraction for tourists who come to stay at the village's spa-resort.\n\nThe hot springs themselves were originally used and revered by the Sts'Ailes (Chehalis) First Nations people who live along the Harrison River nearby. There are two hot springs, the \"Potash\", with a temperature of 40 °C, and the \"Sulphur\", with a temperature of 65 °C. According to Harrison Hot Springs Resort, the waters average 1300 ppm of dissolved mineral solids, one of the highest concentrations of any mineral spring. This hot spring is one of several lining the valley of the Lillooet River and Harrison Lake. The northernmost of the Lillooet River hot springs is at Meager Creek, north of Whistler, with another well-known one to the east of Whistler at Skookumchuck Hot Springs, midway between Pemberton and Port Douglas. One feature of this chain of hot springs is that the Harrison Hot Springs vent is the most sulfuric, and there is consistently less sulfur content as one goes northwards, with the springs at Meager Creek having almost no scent at all.\n\nSome geologists consider that an unstable rock face at Mount Breakenridge above the north end of the giant fresh-water fjord of Harrison Lake in the Lower Mainland of southwestern British Columbia, Canada, could collapse into the lake, generating a large wave that might destroy the town of Harrison Hot Springs (located at its south end).\n\nThe population of Harrison Hot Springs has been steadily growing in recent years. The Canadian Census has reported 655 people in 1991, 898 in 1996, 1343 in 2001, and 1573 in 2006. It has since receded slightly to 1,468 in 2011 and 2016.\n\nHarrison Hot Springs' major economy is tourism in relation to the hot springs, with over half of employment found in service industries, with much of the rest found split through retail, government, construction and manufacturing are represented, as well as minor activity in other areas.\n\nHarrison Hot Springs' greatest attraction is its titular springs, of course, but it also has the Ranger Station Public Art Gallery, a marina with jet boat tours of the lake available, a nine-hole golf course, and is the closest access to Sasquatch Provincial Park. In July, Harrison Hot Springs hosts the Harrison Festival of the Arts, a ten-day celebration of world music and art. The annual Festival features free outdoor beach concerts, ticketed evening performances, a children's day, visual art exhibits, various workshops and two weekend art markets. The Harrison Festival also presents ten to twelve professional performing arts events between September and May each year.\n\nThe Corporation of the Village of Harrison Hot Springs was incorporated as a municipality in 1949 under the initiative of Colonel Andy Naismith (ret). It has a mayor and four councillors.\n\nHarrison Hot Springs is part of the Chilliwack-Hope provincial electoral district. Federally, Harrison Hot Springs is in the Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon riding, represented in the House of Commons of Canada.\n\n\n"}

The building was developed by Vornado Realty Trust, as a fee developer, with César Pelli & Associates as architect. \n\nThe building comprises a full city block between Lexington and Third Avenues and 58th and 59th Streets. The complex features two towers constructed above a steel office and retail section, separated by a seven-story atrium. The design of the courtyard at One Beacon Court, which connects 58th and 59th Streets, was inspired by other historic New York enclosures such as Grand Central Terminal, the reading room of the New York Public Library Main Branch, and the skating rink at Rockefeller Center; glass walls curve around the perimeter of the courtyard, tilting slightly inward as they rise.\n\nAlthough the building was originally planned to be entirely residential, Bloomberg L.P. negotiated a deal with Vornado Realty Trust to lease of office space at the base of the tower. STUDIOS Architecture did the design, which includes rows of uniform desks for approximately 4,000 employees and a large central atrium known as \"the Link\" that overlooks the courtyard. Paul Goldberger, in the August 6, 2007, issue of \"The New Yorker\" magazine, lauded the Bloomberg offices as \"a newsroom truly designed for the electronic age ... a dazzling work environment tucked inside a refined but conventional skyscraper.\" By 2011, Bloomberg L.P. added another of office space at 731 Lexington Avenue and announced plans to expand to an additional in the former Philip Morris building at 120 Park Avenue.

Sirio Maccioni's Le Cirque restaurant moved to the building from The New York Palace Hotel in 2006, but vacated in 2018.\n\nVarious low-power television stations transmit from antennas on the top of the building.\n\nResidential tenants included Beyoncé, former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams, and Bobby Abreu. Johnny Damon sold his unit for $8 million in 2010. Tina Knowles sold her unit for $5.6 million in 2011. Jack Welch purchased a unit in the building for $6.4 million and Jeffrey Immelt paid just over $4 million for a unit. Hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen's unit is listed for sale for $67.5 million. Joseph Betesh, co-owner of hip hop clothing outlet Dr. Jay's, owned an apartment in the building from 2005 to 2013, which is now owned by VFT Investments.\n\nResidents have access to concierge services by the London-based Quintessentially Group, as well as use of \"The Beacon Club\", the 29th-floor amenity space that includes a health club, entertainment suite, children's playroom and business center.

In 1801 the first wooden Cape Poge Lighthouse was built for $2,000. During the War of 1812 the light was extinguished for a few months and its apparatus was hidden in the cellar of a Chappaquiddick house. This first lighthouse was moved in 1825 and again in 1838 due to an eroding bluff.\n\nIn 1844 a new tower was built for $1,600 and in 1857 supplied with a fourth order Fresnel lens. However, in 1878 it was reported that the keeper's house would probably \"fall into the sea within two years.\" A third lighthouse was therefore built in 1880.\n\nFinally, in 1893 the current, , white conical wood tower was constructed, inland from the previous one. The current tower has been moved four times, in 1907, 1922, 1960, and in 1987 when it became the first lighthouse to be moved by helicopter). The light was automated in 1943.

The team owned cars in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, Camping World Truck Series, and the ARCA Re/Max Series.\n\nThe team's Nationwide Series equipment was originally purchased from the former BACE Motorsports and Andy Petree Racing teams. It was announced in September 2011 that KHI would merge with Richard Childress Racing beginning in 2012, with KHI no longer fielding a vehicle in any of the top three NASCAR divisions.\n\nThis team ran full-time in 2011 with former Sprint Cup driver Elliott Sadler driving and Ernie Cope as the crew chief. The team struggled the early portion of the season, but soon found momentum and battled with Roush Fenway Racing driver Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. for the Nationwide Series points lead. Despite the No. 2 team going winless in 2011, Sadler finished 2nd in points. The team returned in 2012 under the RCR banner.\n\nFor 2009, Harvick planned a one-car effort, but with additional sponsorship for the Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen from Schick Canada, J. R. Fitzpatrick drove the second car at Watkins Glen, carrying the No. 4 for KHI's second team. Tony Stewart drove the 4 in the 2010 season opener at Daytona, winning the race with Oreo/Ritz Crackers sponsorship.\n\nTony Stewart drove the No. 4 Oreo/Ritz Crackers Chevrolet Impala once again at Daytona in 2011. He won his fourth consecutive season opening race with a last lap pass on teammate Clint Bowyer to score his 2nd victory in a row with the No. 4 and his fourth for KHI. Harvick drove at Talladega, Daytona, and Kansas in the No. 4 with Armour Vienna Sausages, OneMain Financial, and Hunt Brothers Pizza sponsoring respectively.\n\nIn July 2011, Tony Stewart raced a fourth KHI car at Daytona with clothing brand Tapout sponsoring. Stewart tried to sweep both Nationwide races held at Daytona, but was caught up in a late wreck.\n\nKHI's No. 33 team was formed when Andy Petree Racing's No. 33 Busch team was shut down halfway through the 2004 season. Kevin Harvick purchased the team and it made its debut in the 19th race of the season at Chicagoland Speedway with Clint Bowyer behind the wheel. He started 40th and finished in the 42nd position due to rear end problems. He drove again at Darlington Raceway and finished 15th. Tony Raines ended the season at the Ford 300 with a 35th-place finish after being involved in a crash.\n\nTony Stewart won the team's first NASCAR Busch Series race in 2005 by winning the Hershey's Take 5 300 at Daytona International Speedway in February. Stewart and Raines shared the 33 that season, with Stewart running races with Old Spice sponsorship, and Raines with Yard Man/Outdoor Channel backing. Raines collected nine top-ten finishes and finished 20th in the points despite only running 23 races. Stewart's lone win in 10 races came at Daytona and had only three top-five finishes. KHI development driver Burney Lamar joined the 33 for a pair of races as well, his best finish a 34th at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nIn 2002 Canadian driver Ron Fellows befriended Harvick and asked for a ride. Harvick agreed to put Fellows in some Busch Series races in the No. 33 Chevy on several occasions during the years. Fellows performed well on the road courses and had some nice performances on some oval tracks. The last time he raced for Kevin Harvick Inc. was in 2007 at Watkins Glen. Kevin Harvick asked Fellows to drive on occasion for KHI in 2007 for one more year and Fellows agreed. In 2007 at Montreal, Fellows almost won the first NBS race there, but placed 4th after a late crash.\n\nThe 2006 again started strong as Stewart again drove the No. 33 to a win at Daytona with teammate Lamar finishing second in the No. 77, marking the first time that the Linville family had fielded a winner in the series, dating to its inaugural year. A variety of drivers competed in the No. 33 during the 2006 season, including Stewart, Harvick, Hornaday, and development drivers Sean Caisse and Aaron Fike. The team finished tenth in the standings at the season. Harvick, Stewart, Raines, and development driver Cale Gale shared the No. 33 Chevrolet in 2007, with sponsorship coming from Old Spice, Camping World, and RoadLoans.com. Harvick, Gale, and Hornaday split the 33 full-time in 2008, scoring fifteen finishes of eighth or better between them. The 33 returned in 2009 with sponsors Rheem, Jimmy John's, Armour Vienna Sausages and Copart. The 33 was driven by Harvick, Stewart, Ryan Newman, Ron Hornaday Jr. along with Gale and Kelly Bires in one race deals. Kevin Harvick finally drove his own equipment to victory in the Scotts Turf Builder 300 at Bristol Motor Speedway on March 21, 2009. This would be the first time he scored a victory in his own equipment after trying for 5 years since the inception of his race team during 2004. The driver lineup changed for 2010 with Harvick, Hornaday, Mike Bliss, Elliott Sadler and Road Ringer Max Papis at Road America and Circuit Gilles Villeneuve with Harvick taking 3 victories at Vegas, Nashville, and Richmond.\n\nFor 2011, the No. 33 carried dual sponsorship from both Rheem and Menards, with Kevin Harvick, Clint Bowyer, Austin Dillon, and new RCR driver Paul Menard splitting the driving duties. Former Red Bull driver Scott Speed intended to drive at the May Iowa race, but his commitment to Dragon Racing for the 2011 Indianapolis 500 prevented him from competing. Speed would drive the car at Montreal and Max Papis drove at Road America. Truck Series driver David Mayhew would make his series debut at the fall Iowa race. The 33 team would finish fourth in owners points, but would go winless. The 33 team will be transferred over to RCR for 2012.\n\nKHI first entered its second Busch Series team in the 2004 fall race at Atlanta Motor Speedway when Tony Stewart piloted the No. 92 McDonald's/Powerade Chevrolet. As a co-promotion in the event, team owner Kevin Harvick drove the No. 29 Powerade/McDonald's Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing.\n\nThe team returned in 2005 renumbered as the No. 83 to run five races. Burney Lamar attempted the car's first race at Nashville Superspeedway but failed to qualify for the event. Wally Dallenbach Jr. made the car's first race at Watkins Glen International, where he finished nineteenth in the Mr. Clean Auto-Dry Wash car. Tony Stewart drove the car at Richmond with Old Spice sponsoring and Tony Raines drove the car with Cub Cadet funding at Kansas, finishing 40th and 17th, respectively.\n\nFor 2006, the team signed Dollar General as a sponsor and switched to the No. 77 with Lamar driving and competing for NASCAR Rookie of the Year. He opened the season with a runner-up finish at Daytona, and had two additional top-tens and led the Rookie of the Year standings until summer. During the race weekend at Kansas in 2006, Harvick announced he had removed Lamar from the No. 77, due to Dollar General wanting Cup drivers in the No. 77 and hired 2000 Winston Cup champion Bobby Labonte to drive the car for the rest of the season. Labonte, Harvick, and Kertus Davis were scheduled share the 77 for the 2007 season. Labonte brought the number 77 to its first victory at Talladega on April 28, 2007. Davis was later released, with Ron Hornaday Jr. filling in for races that Davis was scheduled to drive for the team, after Davis did not crack the top 30 in his five starts in the No. 77. In 2008 Cale Gale drove the car in three races with sponsorship from VFW and Rheem.\n\nThe No. 2 truck originally ran as a second truck to the No. 6 in 2004 for a pair of races as the No. 92. Harvick drove with sponsorship from Snap-On Tools and GM Goodwrench sponsoring, with Harvick finished in the top-five in both races. It ran again in 2005 for two races with Harvick and another two with Lamar. Harvick had the best finish of fifth. Tony Stewart attempted the race at Richmond, but, surprisingly, failed to qualify for the race, despite winning the past two Richmond truck races, mainly from NASCAR's new all-exempt tour policy.\n\nThe truck in 2007 was used for most of the season, running a Part-Time Schedule with a variety of drivers, from KHI developmental driver, Cale Gale to Richard Childress Racing Nextel Cup drivers, Harvick and Clint Bowyer in the No. 2. For the 2008 season, Jack Sprague was signed on to pilot the No. 2 truck Full Time with sponsorship from American Commercial Lines. However, Sprague was unable to find victory lane and was released on October 8. Harvick, Gale, and Ryan Newman shared this truck for the remainder of the season. Newman drove this truck to victory lane in the final fall race at Atlanta with a late pass on Ron Hornaday Jr.\n\nFormer motocross champion Ricky Carmichael was signed to KHI in 2009, which changed its number to No. 4 out of deference to Carmichael, who raced No. 4 for most of his career. Monster Energy sponsored the truck. Carmichael was caught up in an accident in the season opener. The team rebounded and scored a better finish at the Auto Club Speedway. Carmichael was set to make 14 of the 25 Camping World Truck Series races, with J. R. Fitzpatrick filling out the rest of the schedule. Carmichael and Monster Energy left KHI at the end of the season to race for Turner Motorsports.\n\nIn 2010, the truck returned to being the 2 with Harvick driving, along with Elliott Sadler, Clint Bowyer, Ken Schrader, and Shelby Howard sharing the duties. The 2 team garnered 5 wins, 3 by Harvick (Atlanta, Martinsville, Gateway), 1 by Clint Bowyer (Phoenix), and 1 by Sadler (Pocono). In addition the team finished with 11 top fives and 16 top tens. The team finished 5th in the final owners points. For 2011, Bowyer, Sadler, and Harvick primarily drove the 2 truck, and Cale Gale returned for six races with Rheem on board. The team would capture 7 wins, with Bowyer winning at Phoenix and Kansas, Harvick won 3 in a row at Pocono, Michigan, and Bristol, Ron Hornaday, Jr. drove the truck for 3 races late in the season, winning at Kentucky and Las Vegas, while Harvick won at Texas to easily take the Owners Championship. For 2012, the team was absorbed by Richard Childress Racing.\n\nThe No. 8 truck originally ran as a third truck in 2009 for four races as the No. 2. In 2009, Ryan Newman and Harvick finished with four top fives in the four starts, with Harvick winning in Martinsville.\nKevin Harvick Inc. signed Nelson Piquet Jr. to drive this truck Full Time in 2011. Nelson will be running NASCAR Rookie of the Year. This is one of the first times the 8 truck has run since 1997 when Joe Nemechek's brother John Nemechek was killed. In 2011, Piquet ran full-time with sponsors Qualcomm, Autotrac, Bozzano, Jontex and others. Piquet would finish 10th in his inaugural NASCAR season, but came runner up to Joey Coulter for rookie of the year honors. This truck was bought out by Eddie Sharp Racing for 2012.\n\nThe No. 6 truck was Kevin Harvick Inc.'s first ever truck. It was built in 2001 when Harvick started his self-owned team for 2002 modeled after RCR and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. Initially the company was called Kevin Harvick Motorsports, but it was renamed to KHI in later 2002. In its first race it was driven by Rick Carelli and finished in 5th at Daytona. In its second race at Darlington it finished in 4th place. At Martinsville, Harvick intentionally spun Coy Gibbs causing NASCAR to park the team for the balance of the event. When Harvick lied to reporters, his sponsors and fans; about not intentionally crashing Gibbs, this led to a suspension from the cup race the next morning, a $25,000 fine and a 25 points loss for the truck series. Following this incident Harvick did not race the next event at Gateway to make amends. Later that year, Harvick won the team's first win at Phoenix in autumn and the next year the No. 6 team was folded into the No. 33 team (see below.)\n\nThe No. 33 truck was KHI's first venture into NASCAR. It debuted as the No. 6 Twizzler/PayDay/Sonic Drive-In Chevrolet Silverado in a partnership between the Harvicks and Rick Carelli in 2001. Harvick started fourth and finished second at Richmond International Raceway. Carelli drove the team's next race at the 2002 Florida Dodge Dealers 250 and finished fifth. Harvick competed in five races and picked up his first career Truck win at Phoenix International Raceway.\n\nIn 2003, Harvick ran an additional six races and won once again at Phoenix. Other drivers drove for the team that year were Ed Berrier, Brandon Miller, and Randy LaJoie. Miller had the best finish of eighth at Mesa Marin Raceway. GM Goodwrench climbed aboard as the team's first primary sponsor, and Matt Crafton was hired away from ThorSport Racing as the team's driver. Crafton posted six top-five finishes and finished fifth in points, but left at the end of the season to return to his previous ride. He was replaced by two-time champion Ron Hornaday Jr., who captured a win at Atlanta Motor Speedway and was named the series' Most Popular Driver. At the end of 2005, KHI switched numbers with Roush Fenway Racing to become the No. 33, with the No. 6 going to Roush Fenway. Hornaday Jr. began the year unsponsored but won at Mansfield Motorsports Speedway and finished seventh in points after obtaining sponsorship from Allstate Employer Services. He began 2007 with new sponsorship from Camping World, picked up four victories, and won the 2007 Craftsman Truck Series championship. In 2008, Hornaday won six times but finished second in the championship standings. In 2009 he'd win his fourth championship, a week before the last race of the season.\n\nIn 2010, the 33 team found itself in a slump. Due to the Food and Drug Administration passing a new rule that bans the advertisement of tobacco products, Longhorn dropped its sponsorship mid season, forcing the 33 to run with one race deals until E-Z-GO signed on with a few races remaining. The 33 team brushed off the bad luck with a win at O'Reilly Raceway Park at Indianapolis where he would hold off Kyle Busch. Hornaday Jr. won again at Martinsville and ended up 7th in points.\n\nFor 2011, Hornaday returned to the 33 team and won early in the year at Texas. However, the team struggled midway through the season and lost ground in the points. After Harvick had Hornaday switch over to the 2 truck, Cale Gale would take over the 33 for 2 races while Mike Wallace would drive at Talladega and win his first Truck race since 2000. Hornaday returned to the 33 for the last 3 races of the season and finished second at Martinsville, but was knocked out of the championship hunt at Texas by Kyle Busch and finished 13th at Homestead, ending up 4th in points. The 33 was driven by Cale Gale full-time in 2012 with Eddie Sharp Racing fielding the truck.\n\nIn September 2011, it was announced that KHI would cease to exist following that season, with its teams and equipment being absorbed or bought by other organizations. Harvick's Cup team Richard Childress Racing restarted its Nationwide Series program by merging it with that of KHI, moving the No. 2 team of Elliott Sadler which would finish second in points and the flagship No. 33 which Harvick would continue to drive to the RCR banner. Kevin Harvick's truck program was primarily sold to Eddie Sharp Racing, acquiring the No. 8 truck and No. 33 truck. While Nelson Piquet Jr. moved to Turner Scott Motorsports, development driver Cale Gale and longtime sponsor Rheem went with the No. 33 to ESR, winning the 2012 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. KHI’s 2 truck was also sold to RCR and Harvick continued to drive it in 2012 for 3 races. Harvick's good friend and most successful driver Ron Hornaday Jr. moved on to Joe Denette Motorsports (now NTS Motorsports), which received equipment and support from KHI, for 2012 and 2013 driving their No. 9 truck. Harvick continued to drive NTS's 14 truck in a partial schedule in 2013, and NTS also moved into the former KHI shop prior to the season.\n\nAccording to Harvick, the sale of the team overall was so he could focus winning a Cup championship. For the Xfinity Series program specifically, Harvick stated that the similarity between them and the Cup cars (same chassis and similar bodies) made the costs and resource requirements too great for a non-Cup-affiliated team to function. Kevin Harvick Incorporated currently operates as a sports marketing and management firm, which includes MMA fighters as well as former teammate Jeff Burton.\n\n"}

It is one of seven state-funded, four-year universities of higher education in the state. The university offers bachelor's and master's degrees. Most students obtain a B.S. degree, which requires one quarter of science, whereas a B.A. degree requires two years of a foreign language. In 2016, the University also began work to introduce a Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.) degree with a vocational bent.\n\nEOU opened its doors in 1929 as Eastern Oregon Normal School, a teacher training school. In 1939, the Oregon Legislature changed the name to Eastern Oregon College of Education. The words \"of Education\" were dropped from the college's name in 1956. The 1973 Legislature changed EOC's name to Eastern Oregon State College. In 1997, Eastern Oregon State College became Eastern Oregon University. In 2013 the Oregon University System began the process of creating independent boards for certain schools, including Oregon State and the University of Oregon. On June 30, 2015, the Oregon University System was dissolved and on July 1, 2015, the Eastern Oregon University Board of Trustees took on governance of the institution.\n\nEOU's location in La Grande is in the heart of the Blue Mountain range between Portland, Oregon and Boise, Idaho just off Interstate 84. Driving to La Grande takes approximately four hours from Portland, two and half from Boise, five from Seattle, and four from Spokane. , the school has over 3,000 total students, including those attending on campus and through their online education programs.\n\nThe campus contains 26 buildings, including three living facilities – Alikut Hall, North Hall, and Daugherty Hall – all of which are co-ed. Inlow Hall, Eastern's administration building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nEOU offers a limited number of majors in traditional fields of the Arts, Sciences, Social Sciences, Education, and Business. Budget cuts have eliminated all majors in foreign languages, though a Spanish minor still exists. New programming in vocational fields such as Fire Services Administration and Global Foods and Agribusiness target regional employment needs. \n\nEOU offers bachelor's degrees and the degrees of MFA, MBA, Master of Education and Master of Arts in Teaching. Most degrees conferred, however, are undergraduate B.S. degrees (Bachelor of Science). The university offers business and elementary education programs at a satellite campus in Gresham, Oregon.\n\nThe school is composed of the following colleges in order of size:\n\nEOU is known for its mountainous location and its academic programs related to the outdoors. An outdoor leadership program began in Fall 2016.\n\nIn addition, EOU has military science, agricultural science, and nursing offered on campus by other Oregon universities. Many degrees are available fully online.\n\nEastern Oregon's Psychology department is one of the last university programs that still has its students use live animals in behavioral studies.\n\nEOU employs just over one hundred full-time faculty.

{"id": "2276312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276312", "title": "Gunvalkyrie", "text": "Gunvalkyrie\n\n\"Gunvalkyrie\" received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and innovation, but criticized its steep learning curve stemming from its complex controls.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from most third-person shooters, due to a unique dual analog control scheme, which is the main contributor to the steep learning curve of the game. Players travel to various worlds investigating the disappearance of several colonies, with only giant, mutated, insectoid creatures left behind. These insectoids comprise the bulk of the enemies players face along the way.\n\nPlayers control Kelly or Saburouta with both analog sticks, the left controlling forward/backward movement and turning, while the right aims their weapons, and when clicked, allows quick turns. Clicking in the left stick while pointing in a direction causes the character to boost. The left trigger is a boost/jump, and when combined with the left analog boost, can be strung together into combos to keep the player off the ground entirely, which is a necessity for some levels. Face buttons are used to select weapons, and the right trigger fires the selected weapon.\n\nThe game comprises ten levels, the story unfolding via text between levels, or the occasional in-game cutscene. At the beginning of most levels, excluding boss battles, players have the choice of picking either Kelly or Saburouta. Kelly's primary weapon is fast but weaker, and she's overall faster and more maneuverable. Saburouta is slower, has more limited maneuverability in the air, and carries a stronger primary weapon, the Matchlock Cannon. Basically the two characters make up the two difficulty settings, with Kelly being the \"Normal\", and Saburouta being the \"Advanced\" setting. The real difference being that Kelly's style allowed several lock-on targets, while Saburouta's weapon splashed and was aimed at specific targets. Because of this, Kelly's gameplay is more frantic and requires less direct focus, while Saburota required specific aiming and direct attacks to be effective. Kelly is also the only character to upgrade her gearskin.\n\nThe artistic style of the game is similar to the steampunk subgenre of fiction, but the game's designers prefer to call it \"elec-punk,\" described as a step even further, with the harnessing of electricity for imaginative new uses. The game's stages are divided into indoor mechanical-looking levels, with lots of gears and ornate metalwork, and outdoor stages, set in very organic-looking valleys, craters, and other fantastic otherworldly locations.\n\nThe game takes place in an alternate history in 1906 where the British Empire rules all of Earth and several extrasolar colony worlds, powered by technology brought to the planet by Halley's Comet in 1835. An unknown substance known as Halley's Core was found throughout the world, and certain individuals who came in contact with it and gained superhuman abilities became known as \"Halley's Chosen.\" The first of these was a scientist named Dr. Hebble Gate, who was affected by the comet while in his mother's womb. With his superhuman mind he harnessed the power of Halley's Core and discovered a wide range of scientific breakthroughs, including fusion and nuclear power, genetic engineering, computers, space travel and countless others. With these technologies the British Empire quickly conquered the earth, and Gate is famous as the man responsible. A complete mystery to all, Gate also holds great power over economic, political and military affairs, and is the founder of the Hebble Foundation and the GunValkyrie (GV) Organization, composed of Halley's Chosen throughout the world to prevent the misuse of technology. He suddenly disappears, throwing the world into shock, and has been missing for four years by the time the game begins.\n\nIn addition to his disappearance, the residents of the colonized planet of Tir na Nog have also disappeared, with an outbreak of large alien creatures that resemble giant insects in their place. It is also believed that before his disappearance, Gate was conducting research on how to strengthen the colonists through genetic modification, and it is speculated that the insects and colonists are one and the same.\n\nIn response, members of an elite military force within the GV organization, known as \"Team Dolphin\" (established 1887) is sent to investigate Gate's disappearance as well as the situation on Tir na Nog. Leading the investigation is Gate's only daughter, Lieutenant Meridian Poe, who survives on a life support system developed by her father after he surgically removed her head and disappeared with her body. The two playable characters are Kelly O'Lenmey, born in Ballymun, Ireland, a collected idealist who once aided the Irish Republic in their fight for independence until their methods caused her to leave and join the GV, and Saburouta Mishima, born in Kyushu, Japan, an exiled Samurai of the Meiji Restoration who was saved by the GV after he was unjustly sentenced to capital punishment.\n\nDr. Gate's fate at the end of the game left ambiguous, as the Poe's Report documents presented throughout the game reveal that a body was eventually discovered, but its identity is not confirmed.\n\n\"GunValkyrie\" was originally developed for the Sega Dreamcast. Its visual style was very similar to the final Xbox version. The Dreamcast version's distinguishing feature was that during the game's development, \"GunValkyrie\" utilized a unique control scheme using both a light gun and a controller. This control scheme was dropped when development shifted to the Xbox version.\n\nThe game's soundtrack, composed by Teruhiko Nakagawa and Tatsuyuki Maeda, was also marketed during the game's release. It was during this time period that TokyoPop was publishing Sega soundtrack releases in the United States, including \"GunValkyrie\", \"Virtua Fighter 4, Panzer Dragoon Orta\" and the \"Sonic Adventure 2 Official Soundtrack\". \"GunValkyrie Official Soundtrack\" was released on April 2, 2002. Unusually, and in contrast to the titles mentioned above, a soundtrack CD for the game was not released in Japan.\n\nOn release, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the game a 32 out of 40. In Japan, during the week of the release, the game sold 6000 units becoming the only Xbox game to make it to the top 30 best-selling video games. Metacritic scored the game a 73 out of 100 based on 28 critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". In 2009, GamesRadar included it among the games \"with untapped franchise potential\", and commenting on the game's difficulty: \"a true gaming workout, but few games in the Xbox library were as beautiful to look at or more rewarding to play.\"\n\n"}

The most common fillings are: \"al ragù\" or \"al sugo\", filled with ragù (meat or mince, slow-cooked at low temperature with tomato sauce and spices), mozzarella and/or caciocavallo cheese, and often peas, and \"al burro\" or \"ô burru\", filled with ham and mozzarella or besciamella.\n\nA number of regional variants exist which differ in fillings and shape. \"Arancini al ragù\" produced in eastern Sicily have a conical shape inspired by the volcano Etna.\n\nArancini is a diminutive of \"arancia\", or 'orange'. The name, which is translated as \"little orange\", derives from their shape and colour which, after cooking, is reminiscent of an orange. In Italian, \"arancini\" is grammatically plural (); the corresponding singular is \"arancino\" ( or \"arancina\").\n\nArancini are said to have originated in 10th-century Sicily at a time when the island was under Arab rule.\n\nIn the cities of Palermo, Siracusa, and Trapani in Sicily, arancini are a traditional food for the feast of Santa Lucia on 13 December when bread and pasta are not eaten. This commemorates arrival of a grain supply ship on Santa Lucia's day in 1646, relieving a severe famine.\n\nToday, with the increasing popularity of this finger food in modern Italian food culture, arancini are found all year round at most Sicilian food outlets, particularly in Palermo, Messina and Catania. The dish was traditionally created to provide a full meal to Federico II di Svevia during his hunting activities.\n\nThe most common type of \"arancini\" sold in Sicilian cafés are \"arancini al ragù\", which typically consist of meat in a tomato sauce, rice, and mozzarella or other cheese. Many cafés also offer \"arancini al burro\" (with butter or béchamel sauce) or specialty arancini, such as \"arancini con funghi\" (mushrooms), \"con pistacchi\" (pistachios), or \"con melanzane\" (aubergine).\n\nIn Roman cuisine, \"supplì\" are similar but are commonly filled with cheese (different preparation methods and filling distribution). In Naples, rice balls are called . In a variant recipe originating among the Italian diaspora in Southeast Texas, the arancini are stuffed with a chili-seasoned filling.\n\nIn Italian literature, Inspector Montalbano, the main character of Andrea Camilleri's detective novels, is a well-known lover of arancini especially those made by Adelina Cirrinciò, his housekeeper and cook.

The regiment descends directly from units set up by King Gustav I of Sweden (Gustav Vasa) in 1536, when Sweden set up a draft of horses and men north and south of Stockholm. The regiment was very active in the 1600s and 1700s and helped win several key battles for Sweden on the European continent. Today, the regiment plays a central role in the Swedish Armed Forces and is the most active regiment in Swedish military international engagements.\n\nThe regiment has always had light, highly mobile units with substantial strike-power, and also has long history in the area of intelligence. The regiment currently trains an airborne battalion and an intelligence battalion. The airborne battalion is a rapid-response unit with high mobility that enables it to be first on the scene of a mission. The intelligence battalion is able, through the use of advanced technology, to control and guide attacks by aircraft and artillery against a wide range of targets. The regiment is responsible for the operation of UAVs in Sweden.\n\nThe regiment is also home to the Swedish Parachute Ranger School, Armed Forces Survival School, Special Operations Group as well as being responsible for Örebro/Värmlands Group which trains part of the Home Guard.\n\nThe regiment traces its roots to the Arboga meeting in 1536, when King Gustav I of Sweden (Gustav Vasa) set up the units 'The Flag of Uppland (Upplandsfanan)' and 'The Flag of Södermanland (Södermanlandsfanan)'. Sweden had mostly relied on foreign soldiers/mercenaries for any organized, large-scale warfare before this. The new arrangement was based on voluntary farmers who kept horses and, as incentive to sign up, received tax credits. They were supposed to practice on their own, but organized practice essentially never happened. This frustrated king Gustav Vasa, and his son and eventual successor, King Eric XIV of Sweden, who tried to motivate commanders to keep their units ready for war. But this goal remained elusive and the youngest son of Gustav I of Sweden (Gustav Vasa), Charles IX of Sweden, instituted a new rule in 1609, when he was king, that the units had to be inspected and exercised at least monthly by their commanders.\n\nIn 1612, when Charles IX of Sweden's son Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (Gustav II Adolf) had just been appointed king, the two units had about 200 cavalry riders each and were well trained and organized. These cavalry units would become the backbone of the king's successful military tactics, inspired by the new Polish hussars of the effective light-hussar units during the Thirty Years' War and the Polish-Swedish War. In 1626, he reorganized the Swedish Army completely into independent fighting units called squadrons composed of four mounted-rider (Hussar) companies, with 100 riders each, fighting next to infantry units dragoon. The newly named \"regiment\" units were 'The Riders of Uppland', which recruited from Uppland, Västmanland, and Värmland, and 'The Riders of Södermanland' which recruited from Södermanland and Närke. They had two squadrons each. In the Battle of Lützen (1632), the king himself commanded two of these squadrons, one from each regiment, on the left wing against the Roman Catholic general Wallenstein, where, due to heavy smoke, they became separated from the rest of the army and suffered heavy losses, including the king's life. Sweden still won that battle, and today the name of this battle is included in the regimental flag. These tactics, with cavalry playing the central role of fast flanking manoeuvres on the battlefield, required much more practice than previous styles and Gustavus Adolphus has been called the \"father of modern warfare\", or the first great modern general.\n\nIn 1634, in a major Army reorganization, the two regiments were merged into one regiment called 'The Riders of Uppland' (Upplands ryttare). Commander Field Marshal Sir (Baron) Claes Christersson Horn af Åminne (1587–1651) was leading the Uppland regiment during 1628–1634 and the merger, and his successors were Isak Axelsson Silversparre (1634–1638), Johan Mauritz Wrangel (1639–1657), Pontus Fredric De la Gardie (1658–1664), Eric Planting Gyllenbåga (1664–1667). \nOn 26 November 1667, the regiment was promoted and renamed to the Mounted Royal Life Regiment 'Livregementet till häst' in reward for its achievements under King Charles X Gustav's in the Second Northern War by his son Charles XI of Sweden. Count Otto Wilhelm von Königsmark was the commander of the regiment. Under Charles XI of Sweden, the regiment was distinguished for its great courage in the Scanian War and especially the Battle of Lund in 1676 under commander Nils Bielke. After victory, King Charles XI reportedly uttered, \"näst Gud hade jag att tacka den tappre Nils Bielke och sitt Livregemente\" (\"after God I had the brave Nils Bielke and his Life Regiment to thank\"). The city of Lund is still mentioned in the regiment's flag, and straw, which was used to identify members of the regiment in the foggy battle, still today decorates the regiment's emblem (the circle around the three crowns). By 1679, the regiment had 12 companies organized into three squadrons and had been continuously engaged in warfare for over 80 years.\n\nUnder Charles XII of Sweden, the son of Charles XI of Sweden, the regiment played a central role in the Swedish victories in the Great Northern War. One example is the Battle of Kliszów when the Swedish army of 12,000 men defeated the Polish-Saxon army double its size. In the battle, the right wing, built around the regiment, which had 21 squadrons and 2,100 men and was led by Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld, was surrounded on three sides by the Saxon cavalry of 34 squadrons with 4,250 men. The back line recognized the situation, quickly reverted and switched to attack the flanks of the enemy in a brutal battle which they eventually won. Other battles in the Great Northern War where the regiment played central roles include Crossing of the Düna, Battle of Pułtusk (1703), Battle of Holowczyn, Battle of Poltava and Battle of Helsingborg. All of these city names can be found in the regiment's flag.\n\nThe Mounted Life Regiment was the only regiment within the Garrison of Stockholm that was not enlisted. After 1780, the regiment had its exercise field on Utnäs Löt by Strömsholm. In 1785, a special detachment of light dragoons was formed at the regiment. It was formed by adding 18 men from each company to the dragoons, who formed four companies of 36 men each. This force was later enlarged and in 1789 during the Russian War they appeared as a separate unit of 300 men, six companies, under the name The Light Dragoon Corps of his Majesty's Life Regiment.\n\nIn 1791, the regiment was reorganized into a brigade consisting of Life Regiment Brigade Cuirassier Corps., which consisted of the companies closest to the capital – heavy cavalry; the Life Regiment Brigade Light Dragoon Corps., which consisted of Örebro, Fellingsbro, Östra Nerike's and Vadsbo companies; and the Life Regiment Brigade Light Infantry Battalion, which consisted of the companies in Västmanland and from 1804 also Södermandland's company.\n\nIn 1815, the Life Regiment Light Dragoon Corps. was declared independent and received the name Life Regiment Hussar Corps. The corps was divided primarily into Närke and Northern Västergötland and from 1836 had its office and schools in Örebro. The unit had its meeting place 1815–1836 on Utnös Lut by Strömsholm, and from 1846 on Sanna Hed outside Hallsberg. In 1893, the name was replaced with the present name 'the Life Regiments Hussars'.\n\nIn 1905, the regiment moved into barracks in Skövde. From 1942–1961, the Signal Detachment of Skövde S1 Sk was located in barracks within K 3 regiment area. In 1955, it was decided to reorganize the Life Regiment Hussars into a battalion and manage it together with Skaraborg Armoured Regiment, P 4. At the battalion, an annual training of 150 motorcycle and bicycle Rangers and about 200 Field Policemen (MP) was planned. The number of horses was reduced from 432 to 15. In connection with the transition from company training to battalion, the Life Regiment Hussars again became a regiment.\n\nThe regiment was relocated to Karlsborg Fortress in Karlsborg the 1 July 1984 where it still is located.\n\nThe regiment is located in the Karlsborg Fortress, which is also the home of the Swedish Special Forces, the SOG, the successor or the Special Reconnaissance Group and the Special Protection Group. The regiment in its current form compromises four battalions:\n\nLife Regiment Hussars presents one regimental standard, one school colour and one traditional colour:\n\nThe regimental standard of the Life Regiment Hussars is drawn by Brita Grep and embroidered by hand in insertion technique by Libraria. The standard was presented to the regiment at the then regimental barracks in Skövde by His Majesty the King Gustaf VI Adolf on 14 June 1957.

During his university studies, he began his broadcasting career with the South African Broadcasting Corporation in Johannesburg and appeared in dramatic productions including \"Boy with a Cart\", which won him an award at a national drama festival.\n\nKyle emigrated to England in August 1952, and spent a year as a primary school teacher in south London before becoming a freelance radio and television broadcaster. His involvement with ITV began in its first month - September 1955 - when he appeared on a Sunday afternoon series for ATV. He also made early contributions to ITN, providing commentary to news film.\n\nHis career as a continuity announcer began when he joined Associated-Rediffusion in February 1956, working alongside Muriel Young and the station's head of presentation Leslie Mitchell. Kyle later became Chief Announcer and continued with Rediffusion until the company lost its franchise. He was on duty for the station's final night of transmission on Monday 29 July 1968.\n\nIt was during Kyle's time at Rediffusion that he made television history by presenting the first schools programme on British television in 1957. The programme was called \"Looking and Seeing\" and Kyle was criticised for talking too much and trying \"to cover too much ground in too short a time\".\n\nHe then hosted other schools and children's programmes produced by A-R in the late 1950s and early 1960s, voiced over local adverts for ATV in the Midlands, was heard as a narrator on a number of LP records, and composed light music.\n\nFollowing Rediffusion's closure, Kyle moved to the new Yorkshire Television in Leeds, where he served as its Chief Announcer for nearly a quarter of a century.

It was Miguel Indurain's fifth and final victory in the Tour. On the fifteenth stage Italian rider Fabio Casartelli died after an accident on the Col de Portet d'Aspet.\n\nThe points classification was won by Laurent Jalabert, while Richard Virenque won the mountains classification. Marco Pantani won the young rider classification, and ONCE won the team classification.\n\nLance Armstrong's best finish in the Tour de France went down to his 36th-place finish in 1995, after his results from August 1998 to August 2012, including his seven Tour titles were stripped on 22 October 2012.\n\nThere were 21 teams in the 1995 Tour de France, each composed of 9 cyclists. The teams were selected in two rounds. In May 1995, the first fifteen teams were announced. In June, five wildcards were announced. Shortly before the start, Le Groupement folded because their team leader Luc Leblanc was injured, and because of financial problems. Their spot went to , the first team in the reserve list. Additionally, the organisation decided to invite one extra team: a combined team of and ZG Mobili, with six riders from Telekom and three from ZG Mobili.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\n\nInvited teams\n's Indurain, the winner of the four previous Tours, was the clear favourite for the overall victory. His main challengers were expected to be Rominger from Mapei, Berzin from Gewiss and Zülle from ONCE.\n\nThe 1995 Tour de France started on 1 July, and had two rest days, the first at 10 July when the cyclists were transferred from Seraing to Le Grand-Bornand, and the second on 17 July in Saint-Girons. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 15.\n\nThe first riders in the prologue rode in sunny weather, but then it started to rain, and the riders who started late had to ride on slippery roads. Chris Boardman, a big favourite for the prologue and an outsider for the overall classification, crashed during his ride, was then hit by his team's car, and had to abandon due to injury. The winner of the prologue was Jacky Durand, one of the early starters.\n\nDurand stayed in the lead until the third stage, when Laurent Jalabert overtook him due to time bonuses won in intermediate sprints. Jalabert kept the yellow jersey for two stages, losing it due to a crash in the fourth stage. Ivan Gotti, member of the Gewiss-team that had won the team time trial in stage three, became the new leader.\nA surprising attack from Indurain in stage seven changed the standings. Indurain attacked in the hilly Ardennes, and only Johan Bruyneel was able to follow him. Indurain did all the work, creating a margin of almost one minute, and Bruyneel only followed him, but beat Indurain in the sprint, winning the stage and becoming the new leader.\nIndurain was now in second place in the general classification, and after winning the time trial in the eighth stage, he became the new leader. His closest rival in the overall classification was Bjarne Riis at 23 seconds, the others were more than two minutes behind.\n\nThe Tour then reached the high mountains in stage nine. Zülle escaped, and created a margin of several minutes. Indurain calmly chased him until the final climb, where he sped away from the others. Zülle won the stage and jumped to the second place in the overall classification, but Indurain won minutes on all other cyclists.\nThe tenth stage was again in the high mountains. Pantani, already irrelevant for the overall classification, won the stage; behind him Indurain, Zülle and Riis finished together.\n\nStage twelve was not expected to be relevant for the general classification. But when Laurent Jalabert attacked early in the stage, this changed. Jalabert was a teammate of second-placed Zülle, and he was sixth in the general classification, more than nine minutes behind Indurain. Jalabert was joined by three other cyclists, of which two teammates. One of them, Melchior Mauri, was in eighth place, and was himself also a threat. The teammates worked together well, and when they were more than ten minutes ahead, Jalabert was the virtual leader. At that moment, Indurain's Banesto team and Riis' Gewiss team started to work together to close the gap. They reduced it to almost six minutes, which meant that Jalabert jumped to third place in the general classification. ONCE now had three cyclists in the top five: Zülle in second place, Jalabert in fourth place and Mauri in fifth place.\n\nIn stage thirteen Serhiy Utchakov and Lance Armstrong broke clear and were alone heading for the finish where Utchakov won the sprint. Armstrong was asked why he wasn't living up to expectations as far as competing with Indurain to which he replied that Indurain didn't finish his first two Tours and finished in the bottom half of several others before blossoming in to who he is. \"They expect you to be with Miguel Inurain all the time and that's just... You just can't do that in a race like this. This is a man's race and it's hard for kid to compete.\"\n\nThe Pyrenées were reached in stage fourteen. Pantani again showed his strengths in the mountains, winning the stage. The other favourites stayed more or less together, so there were no big changes in the general classification.\n\nIn the fifteenth stage, Richard Virenque escaped early in the stage, reaching all six tops in the stage first, and won the stage. Behind him, several cyclists crashed on the descent of the Portet d'Aspet, including Fabio Casartelli. Casartelli's head hit a concrete barrier at high speed without wearing a helmet, and he was declared dead in the hospital.\n\nOut of respect for Casartelli, the sixteenth stage was raced non-competitively. Casartelli's teammates from Motorola were allowed to cross the finish line first. The eighteenth stage was won by Lance Armstrong, a teammate of Casartelli. Armstrong dedicated this stage victory to Casartelli. Indurain was still leading firmly, and extended his lead by winning the last time trial.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1995 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Hernán Buenahora won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 15. This prize was won by Richard Virenque.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a tour guide of historic battlefields for The Smithsonian Associates. He served as Chief Historian of the National Park Service from 1981 to 1994 and is currently Chief Historian Emeritus.\n\nBearss was born in Billings, Montana, the elder son of Omar Effinger Bearss and Virginia Louise Morse Bearss, and grew up on the family cattle ranch near Sarpy, Montana. His father, a Marine in World WarI, read accounts of military campaigns to Bearss, and his lifelong interest in military history was inspired by John Thomason's biography of Confederate cavalry general J.E.B. Stuart.\n\nBearss graduated from Hardin High School in May 1941 and hitchhiked around the United States, visiting his first Civil War battlefields. He enlisted in the Marine Corps on April 28, 1942, and by July was on a troop transport to the Pacific War. He was with the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion in the invasion of Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands and 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, in New Britain.\n\nOn January 2, 1944, Bearss was severely wounded at \"Suicide Creek\" (Cape Gloucester, New Britain) by Japanese machine gun fire. He was evacuated to California, and spent 26 months recovering in various hospitals. He was honorably discharged from the Marines as a corporal on March 15, 1946, and returned home to Montana.\n\nBearss used the G.I. Bill to finance his education at Georgetown University, from which he obtained a B.S. degree in Foreign Service studies in 1949. He worked for three years in the United States Navy Hydrographic Office in Maryland and used his spare time to visit numerous Civil War battlefields in the East. He received his M.A. in history from Indiana University in 1955, writing his thesis on Confederate General Patrick Cleburne. As part of his research, he visited the Western Theater battlefields on which Cleburne fought, telling friends, \"You can't describe a battlefield unless you walk it.\" In February 2005, Lincoln College awarded Bearss an honorary doctorate, and in May 2010, Gettysburg College awarded him an honorary doctorate of humane letters.\n\nOn the battlefield of Shiloh in 1954, he made a career decision inspired by the park historian he met, Charles E. (Pete) Shedd: interpretation of battles in the field was far more interesting than the academic study of history in an office. Although attracted to a National Park Service career, he first joined the Office of the Chief of Military History, U.S. Army, but soon took work as an historian at Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg, Mississippi. It was at Vicksburg that he met his wife, Margie Riddle Bearss (1925–2006), also a Civil War historian; they were married on July 30, 1958. They first lived in the Leila Luckett House in Vicksburg formerly occupied by then-Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's soldiers in 1863, and eventually had three children: Sara Beth, Edwin Cole, Jr., and Mary Virginia (Jenny).\n\nAt Vicksburg, Bearss did the research leading him and two friends to the long-lost Union gunboat U.S.S. \"Cairo\". He also located two forgotten forts at Grand Gulf, Mississippi. He was promoted in 1958 to Southeast regional historian, working out of Vicksburg, but he spent the majority of his time on the road, visiting virtually every battlefield in the country. As popular interest in the Civil War increased with the centennial celebrations starting in 1961, Bearss was recognized as more knowledgeable on the battlefields than virtually anyone else and he was enlisted to develop a variety of new parks, including Pea Ridge and Wilson's Creek. During his long NPS career, he also led efforts in Fort Smith; Stones River, Fort Donelson; battlefields around Richmond, Bighorn Canyon; the Eisenhower Farm at Gettysburg; the gold miners' route over Chilkoot Pass; President Lyndon B. Johnson's Ranch; Fort Moultrie; Fort Point; William Howard Taft House; Fort Hancock at the Boston Navy Yard; and the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site.\n\nIn 1966, Bearss was transferred to Washington, D.C. On November 1, 1981, he was named Chief Historian of the National Park Service, a position he held until 1994. From 1994 to 1995, he served as special assistant to the director. After his retirement in 1995, he received the title Chief Historian Emeritus, which he holds to this day.\n\nIn 1972, Bearss became a founding member of the Board of Advisors of Sea Research Society and participated in the creation of its College of Marine Arts. He was active in the society's efforts to raise the wreck of the Civil War submarine \"Hunley\", which had been found off Charleston, South Carolina, in 1995.\n\nA \"Washington Post\" reporter described Bearss' style as a guide as \"Homeric monologues.\" The \"Wall Street Journal\" wrote that he evokes \"almost hallucinatory sensations.\" Historian Dennis Frye said a \"battlefield [tour] with Ed Bearss [is a] transcendental experience.\" His speaking style is slow and imposing; spaced with overly dramatic pauses and shifts in pitch that tend to inflate the significance of what is being said, sacrificing succinctness for drama, and designed to command the listener's attention and impress them with his well-rehearsed eloquence.\n\nBearss started interpretative touring as part of his official duties in Vicksburg, leading eight one-hour tours a day. Although he was no longer required to do so after 1958, he kept it up as an avocation on weekends. He attracted ROTC classes, active-duty military officers and VIPs, and other historians. Beginning in 1961, he began annual tours for the prestigious Chicago Civil War Roundtable. One of his greatest challenges was his annual tours of Vicksburg for the Louisiana School for the Blind and Deaf.\n\nHe is a lifetime honorary member of the Cleveland Civil War Roundtable, to which he has spoken many times, beginning in 1962 and as recently as 2004. In addition, he has conducted tours for The Smithsonian Associates since 1977 for an estimated 16,000 participants. The majority of these tours focus on Civil War battlefields in the Washington, D.C. region, but have also covered other topics in American military history.\n\nPopular \"Smithsonian Associates\" tours include his retelling of the Crossings of the Upper Potomac, Battle of Antietam, Booth's Escape Route, Battle of Cold Harbor, and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign to name a few.\n\nAt 90, Bearss continued to lead numerous tours—traveling as many as 200 days per year—around the United States, the Pacific, and Europe.\n\nBearss lives in Arlington County, Virginia.\n\nBearss has received a number of awards and honors in the field of history and preservation:\n\n\n\"As sole author:\"\n\n\"In collaboration:\"\n\n\"As editor, alone and in collaboration:\"\n\n\"As a contributor:\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2276355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276355", "title": "Elizabethan architecture", "text": "Elizabethan architecture\n\nElizabethan architecture refers to buildings of a certain style constructed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland from 1558–1603. Historically, the era sits between the long era of dominant architectural style of religious buildings by the Catholic Church, which ended abruptly at the Dissolution of the Monasteries from c.1536, and the advent of a court culture of pan-European artistic ambition under James I (1603–25). Stylistically, Elizabethan architecture is notably pluralistic. It came at the end of insular traditions in design and construction called the Perpendicular style in church building, the fenestration, vaulting techniques and open truss designs of which often affected the detail of larger domestic buildings. However, English design had become open to the influence of early printed architectural texts (namely Vitruvius and Alberti) imported to England by members of the church as early as the 1480s. Into the 16th century, illustrated continental pattern-books introduced a wide range of architectural exemplars, fueled by the archaeology of classical Rome which inspired myriad printed designs of increasing elaboration and abstraction. \n\nAs church building turned to the construction of great houses for courtiers and merchants, these novelties accompanied a nostalgia for native history as well as huge divisions in religious identity, plus the influence of continental mercantile and civic buildings. Insular traditions of construction, detail and materials never entirely disappeared. These varied influences on patrons who could favour conservatism or great originality confound attempts to neatly classify Elizabethan architecture. This era of cultural upheaval and fusions corresponds to what is often termed Mannerism and Late Cinquecento in Italy, French Renaissance architecture in France, and the Plateresque style in Spain.\n\nIn contrast to her father Henry VIII, Elizabeth commissioned no new royal palaces, and very few new churches were built, but there was a great boom in building domestic houses for the well-off, largely due to the redistribution of ecclesiastical lands after the Dissolution. The most characteristic type, for the very well-off, is the showy prodigy house, using styles and decoration derived from Northern Mannerism, but with elements retaining signifies of medieval castles, such as the normally busy roof-line.\n\nThe Elizabethan era saw growing prosperity, and contemporaries remarked on the pace of secular building among the well-off. The somewhat tentative influence of Renaissance architecture is mainly seen in the great houses of courtiers, but lower down the social scale large numbers of sizeable and increasingly comfortable houses were built in developing vernacular styles by farmers and townspeople. Civic and institutional buildings were also becoming increasingly common.\n\nRenaissance architecture had achieved some influence in England during the reign of, and mainly in the palaces of, Henry VIII, who imported a number of Italian artists. Unlike Henry, Elizabeth built no new palaces, instead encouraging her courtiers to build extravagantly and house her on her summer progresses. The style they adopted was more influenced by the Northern Mannerism of the Low countries than Italy, among other features it used versions of the Dutch gable, and Flemish strapwork in geometric designs. Both of these features can be seen on the towers of Wollaton Hall and again at Montacute House. Flemish craftsmen succeeded the Italians that had influenced Tudor architecture; the original Royal Exchange in London (1566–1570) is one of the first important buildings designed by Henri de Paschen, an architect from Antwerp. However, most continental influence came from books, and there were a number of English \"master masons\" who were in effect architects and in great demand, so that their work is often widely spread around the country.\n\nImportant examples of Elizabethan architecture include: \n\nIn England, the Renaissance first manifested itself mainly in the distinct form of the prodigy house, large, square, and tall houses such as Longleat House, built by courtiers who hoped to attract the queen for a ruinously expensive stay, and so advance their careers. Often these buildings have an elaborate and fanciful roofline, hinting at the evolution from medieval fortified architecture.\n\nIt was also at this time that the long gallery became popular (for the Aristocracy) in English houses. This was apparently mainly used for walking in, and a growing range of parlours and withdrawing rooms supplemented the main living room for the family, the great chamber. The great hall was now mostly used by the servants, and as an impressive point of entry to the house.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276358", "title": "Cold war (general term)", "text": "Cold war (general term)\n\nA cold war is a state of conflict between nations that does not involve direct military action but is pursued primarily through economic and political actions, propaganda, acts of espionage or proxy wars waged by surrogates. This term is most commonly used to refer to the Soviet–American Cold War of 1947–1989. The surrogates are typically states that are satellites of the conflicting nations, i.e., nations allied to them or under their political influence. Opponents in a cold war will often provide economic or military aid, such as weapons, tactical support or military advisors, to lesser nations involved in conflicts with the opposing country.\n\nThe expression \"cold war\" was rarely used before 1945. Some writers credit the fourteenth century Spaniard Don Juan Manuel for first using the term (in Spanish), when dealing with the conflict between Christianity and Islam as a \"cold war\". However he used the term \"tepid\" not \"cold\". The word \"cold\" first appeared in a faulty translation of his work in the 19th century.\n\nAt the end of World War II, George Orwell used the term in the essay \"You and the Atomic Bomb\" published October 19, 1945, in the British newspaper \"Tribune\". Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war, he warned of a \"peace that is no peace\", which he called a permanent \"cold war\". Orwell directly referred to that war as the ideological confrontation between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. Moreover, in \"The Observer\" of March 10, 1946, Orwell wrote that \"[a]fter the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire.\"\n\nThe definition which has now become fixed is of a war waged through indirect conflict. The first use of the term in this sense, to describe the post–World War II geopolitical tensions between the USSR and its satellites and the United States and its western European allies (which in practice acted as satellites of the opposing force) is attributed to Bernard Baruch, an American financier and presidential advisor. In South Carolina, on April 16, 1947, he delivered a speech (by journalist Herbert Bayard Swope) saying, \"Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war.\" Newspaper reporter-columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency, with the book \"Cold War\" (1947).\n\nSince the U.S.–USSR Cold War (1947–1991), a number of global and regional tensions have also been called a cold war.\n\nThe Second Cold War, also called Cold War II, Cold War 2.0, or the New Cold War refers to a renewed state of political and military tension between opposing geopolitical power blocs, with one bloc typically reported as being led by Russia or China, and the other led by the United States or NATO. This is akin to the original Cold War that saw a global confrontation between the Western Bloc led by the United States and the Eastern Bloc led by the Soviet Union, Russia's predecessor.\n\nAn Atlantic Council member Bilal Y. Saab, an About.com writer Primoz Manfreda, an Iranian scholar Seyyed Hossein Mousavian and a Princeton University scholar Sina Toossi, journalist Kim Ghattas, \"Foreign Policy\" journalist Yochi Dreazen, Brookings Institution researcher Sultan Barakat, and \"Newsweek\" journalist Jonathan Broder use the term \"cold war\" to refer to tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nIn February 2016, a University of Isfahan professor Ali Omidi dismissed the assumptions that the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia would grow tense.\n\nA commentator Ehsan Ahrari, a writer Bruce Riedel, a political commentator Sanjaya Baru and a Princeton University academic Zia Mian have used the term \"cold war\" since 2002 to refer to long-term tensions between India and Pakistan, which were part of the British India until its partition in 1947.\n\nA Naval Postgraduate School academic Edward A. Olsen, a British politician David Alton, a York University professor Hyun Ok Park, and a University of Southern California professor David C. Kang used the term to refer to tensions between North Korea and South Korea, which have been divided since the end of World War II in 1945. They interchangeably called it the \"Korean Cold War\". In August 2019, North Korean government said that further US–South Korean military cooperation would prompt North Korea to \"trigger a new cold war on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.\"\n\nSimilarly, the relationship between China and the Soviet Union after the Sino-Soviet split have been termed a \"cold war\".\n\nChina's Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng, \"The Diplomat\" editor Shannon Tiezzi, and \"The Guardian\" columnist Simon Tisdall used the term to refer to tensions between China and Japan. China's state-run newspaper \"Global Times\" says that China and Japan \"are stuck in a state of 'cold peace' and [m]ust avoid sliding into a cold war\".\n\nImran Ali Sandano of the University of Sindh, Arup K. Chatterjee of the Jindal Global Law School, journalist Bertil Lintner, writer Bruno Maçães, politician-lawyer P. Chidambaram, and some others use the terms like \"new cold war\" to refer to growing tensions between China and India.\n"}

Katayama expanded Nissan's focus from economy vehicles towards sportier vehicles, and is regarded by Datsun/Nissan Z Car enthusiasts as the father of the Z-Car, as well as the Datsun 510.\n\nAsoh was born in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, the second of four children of a well-off businessman whose postings took the family to various places in Japan and also to Taiwan. While in Taiwan, the young Yutaka fell ill with malaria and was sent to the estate of his paternal grandfather, a wealthy landowner in Saitama Prefecture, to convalesce and attend school. He would gain his first exposure to the United States in mid-1929, while he was preparing to enter his father's alma mater of Keio University. At that time, he got a job as ship's clerk and assistant purser on the freighter \"London Maru\", carrying a cargo of raw silk to Victoria, British Columbia and Vancouver, as well as 20 passengers to Seattle. By several reports, he spent the next four months traveling around the Pacific Northwest while the ship was being loaded with lumber for her return voyage.\n\nIn 1935, he graduated from Keio University and landed a job with Nissan. In 1937, he married Masako Katayama and took her family name, as there were no sons in her family and he had two other brothers to carry on the Asoh name.\n\nIn 1939, during World War II, he was ordered to report to a Nissan plant in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, but managed to obtain a transfer back to Japan in 1941. Near the end of the war in 1945, he refused orders to return to Manchukuo; Katayama later credited his survival of the war to this decision.\n\nHe returned to the U.S. in 1960, when Nissan sent him to do market research, after which he returned to Nissan in Japan and persuaded the company to start its own sales company in the United States.\n\nDatsun started to import the first of the Fairlady models starting with spl212 in 1960 through to the Datsun 2000 sports, the precursor to the highly successful 240z. 1968, the Datsun 510 was introduced. It cost $2,000 and carried independent rear suspension on sedans. He persuaded the Nissan corporate office in Japan to export the all new 510 with a larger 1.6 liter motor. This motor allowed the 510 to be viable on American roadways. In 1970, he introduced the Datsun 240Z, which Nissan had originally wanted to be named the Fairlady. However, his radical ideas for operations did not sit well with the executives of Nissan in Japan. Mr. K left America in 1977 for Japan and was forced into retirement. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame on October 13, 1998 for his lifetime contributions, among them the Datsun 510 and 240Z. He was inducted into the Japan Automotive Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nA 1997 advertisement campaign for the then-introduced Nissan Frontier featured actor Dale Ishimoto portraying Katayama with a Jack Russell Terrier, stating \"Dogs Love Trucks!\" The campaign was further expanded to the entire Nissan line in the United States with the tagline \"Enjoy The Ride.\"\n\nHis son Hiroshi was an Olympic bronze medalist in soccer in the 1968 Mexico City Summer Games. Katayama died at a hospital in Tokyo February 2015 and was survived by his wife, Masako, two sons and two daughters, 11 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.\n\n"}

He graduated from the 22nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1910 and after serving s a junior officer with the IJA 37th Infantry Regiment, he attended the Army's Toyama School and subsequently graduated from the 30th class of the Army Staff College in 1918. He served in various bureaucratic staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from 1919 to 1920, and was sent as a military attaché to the United States from 1923 to 1924. After his return to Japan, he continued to serve in various staff positions, mostly as an instructor, except for a brief stint as commander of the 1st Guards Regiment from 1935 to 1937. \n\nTanaka was promoted to major general at the end of 1937, and briefly assigned as Chief of Staff of the Taiwan Army in 1938. However, with the increase in military activity in China due to the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tanaka was quickly reassigned to become chief of staff of the newly-formed Japanese Twenty-First Army from 1938 to 1939. This army was under the control of the China Expeditionary Army would later be assigned the primary role in the Canton Operation (the invasion of Guangdong Province) in southern China; however, Tanaka returned to Japan in August 1939 to serve as Commandant of the Toyama Army Infantry School, before combat operations began. \n\nIn August 1940, he was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of the IJA 21st Division. As part of the Japanese 12th Army, the division participated in counter-insurgency operations in northern China as well as the Battle of South Shanxi in May 1941, and the subsequent Hundred Regiments Offensive. From November 1941, the division was transferred to the control of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and transferred to the Philippines, landing at Lingayen Gulf in February 1942 for the Philippines Campaign. Tanaka was transferred to command the IJA Twenty-Third Army in China from March 1943. This was primarily a garrison force to deter the possible landings of Allied forces in southern China. It was involved in the Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou (part of Operation Ichi-Go) from August to November 1944 and surrendered to the Chinese Kuomintang forces on August 15, 1945 with the surrender of Japan.\n\nConcurrently, from February 1945 to the end of the war, Tanaka was Governor-General of Hong Kong during the Japanese occupation.\n\nAt the end of the war, Tanaka was arrested by the American occupation authorities and tried before an American military tribunal held in Shanghai in 1946 for command responsibility in the extrajudicial execution of Allied prisoners of war. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. However, he was then turned over to a Kuomintang military tribunal at Nanjing for war crimes in connection with the actions of IJA 23rd Army in China. Found guilty, he was executed by shooting in 1947. He was buried in Guangzhou and his remains were repatriated back to Japan in 1972.\n\n\n"}

Its football team plays in Segunda División B – Group 3.\n\nThe club was founded in 1886 and is one of the oldest football clubs in Spain. It has teams competing in athletics, basketball, tennis, gymnastics, table tennis and futsal, but a football team was not formed until 1914. The team enjoyed a three-year La Liga spell in its beginnings (1947–50).\n\nSince 1972, the team has played home games at \"Nou Estadi\", which seats 14,593 spectators.\n\nThe club was founded on 1 March 1886 by a group of fifteen people who met at the \"Cafè del Centre\" on \"Rambla Nova\". The majority of the club's early members belonged to the upper middle class and, as the club name suggests, was initially founded to promote gymnastics. Later the club members began to organise fencing, hiking, boxing and cycling. In 1914, the club absorbed a local football club called the \"Club Olímpic de Tarragona\" and consequently formed its own football team using the former colours of Olímpic: red, white and black. In those days the team played home matches in the \"Avenida Catalunya\" stadium.\n\nIn January 1918, Gimnàstic made its debut as a football team in the \"Campionat de Catalunya\" and by 1927 were crowned champions in the second division. In the 1943–44 season the team appeared in the Tercera División and in the following season moved up to the Segunda División.\n\nIn the 1946–47 season Nàstic finished second in the second division and entered the La Liga. In 1947 it also reached the \"Copa del Generalísimo\" semi-final but lost to the RCD Espanyol, having beaten the FC Barcelona in the previous round.\n\nThe team finished its debut first division season in seventh place, with the highlight of the season coming on 11 January 1948 with a 3–1 win against the Real Madrid at the Bernabéu, thus becoming the first team ever to do so. The club played two further seasons in the top level, being relegated in 1949–50 after losing a play-off to the CD Alcoyano. The team moved to the new \"Nou Estadi\" in 1972.\n\nFifty-six years later, for the 2006–07 season, Gimnàstic returned to the top flight. Along with coach Luis César Sampedro, some of the players responsible for the promotion included veterans Antonio Pinilla and Albano Bizarri. Rubén Castro, Ariza Makukula and Javier Portillo (eventually the team's top scorer) were also brought in. The club was placed in the relegation zone for 33 of the 38 rounds, eventually dropping down a division. Sampedro was replaced mid-season by Paco Flores who improved the team's numbers. In the middle of 2007 the club was crowned the Copa Catalunya champions after a 2–1 win over the FC Barcelona, with goals from Pinilla and Tati Maldonado.\n\nAfter returning to the second level Gimnàstic achieved a mid-table position in 2007–08 and 2008–09 with César Ferrando in charge of the team. However, in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons, the club only managed to rank one position above the relegation zone. In the 2011–12 campaign the team was relegated to the Segunda División B after only winning six games out of 42.\n\nOn 12 September 2012 Nàstic won the second Catalan Cup in its history, after defeating the AEC Manlleu with an Eugeni goal. In the 2014–15 campaign, after finishing first in its group, the club returned to the second level after defeating the SD Huesca in the play-offs.\n\nIn the 2018–19 campaign the team was relegated to the Segunda División B ending a four-year run in the second division.\n\nThere are two small ultras groups: a right-wing political group called \"Ultras Tarraco\" and an antifa group called \"Nàstic Crew\".\n\n\n\"The numbers are established according to the official website\":www.gimnasticdetarragona.com and www.lfp.es\n\n\"Players who appeared in more than 100 league matches for the club and/or reached international status.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was built as the head office of the Royal Insurance company.\n\nThe building was constructed between 1896 and 1903 as the head office of the Royal Insurance Company (Since 1996 part of the ″RSA Insurance Group″). The design was the result of a competition won by James F. Doyle in 1895. The assessor for the competition was Norman Shaw, who was retained as an advisory architect for the project, but it is uncertain what part he played in it. The building is constructed around a steel frame and is the earliest example of this type of construction in the United Kingdom. It ceased to be used by the late 1980s, and its condition deteriorated so much that it was placed on the Buildings at Risk Register of English Heritage. In the late 1800’s it is believed that a family of 5, the “Pevsner” family, was brutally murdered on the first floor. The mystery is yet to be solved. \n\nIn 2013 its freehold was bought by Liverpool City Council, and it was converted it into a hotel. It opened as the Aloft Liverpool Hotel on 29 October 2014. At the 20 years of the register, the renovation of the Royal Insurance Building was named as one of the successful rescues.\n\nConstructed around a steel frame, the building is in Portland stone, with a granite basement and ground floor. Its architecture is described as \"sumptious Neo-Baroque on the grandest scale\". The building is in four storeys with a basement and an attic. Its long front on North John Street has eleven bays, with three bays on Dale Street. The ground floor and basement are rusticated. The windows are three-light sash windows with round heads. Those on the first floor have Gibbs surrounds and iron balconies. In the second and third floors the windows are recessed behind a Doric colonnade and entablature. In the attic are dormers. Some of these have architraves, keystones, and either segmental or triangular pediments; the others are flat-topped and contain casement windows. The entrance is on the second bay from the left in North John Street. The doorway has Doric columns and is round-headed. The first floor contains a round-headed window surrounded by a portico with a broken segmental pediment containing carved figures. Above this bay rises a three-stage campanile bearing an octagonal cupola with a gilded dome. On the Dale Street façade is a Venetian window. The second floor contains a frieze designed by C. J. Allen depicting themes relating to insurance. At the corners of this front are octagonal turrets with cupolas and finials. Between the turrets at attic level are three round-headed windows with rusticated Ionic pilasters, an entablature, and an iron balcony.\n\nThe interior contains the former General Office on the ground floor which, because of the steel frame, is free from any columns. Above this, the former Board Room has a tunnel vault. Both rooms are decorated with stucco in 17th-century style. The building is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.\n\nThere is an earlier \"Royal Insurance Building\", dating from 1839, in nearby Queen Avenue, also Grade II* listed.\n\n\n"}

Whilst many naturists will restrict their activities to specially designated areas and/or places where there is a tradition of naked activity, such as nudist beaches, others may wish to enjoy nudity more widely.\n\nAccording to the law, recognition exists for a balance to be struck between the naturist's right to freedom of expression and the right of the wider public to be protected from harassment, alarm and distress.\n\nAs a member of the International Naturist Federation, British Naturism adopted the 1974 Declaration Agde that states that naturism is \"a lifestyle in harmony with nature, expressed through social nudity, and characterised by self-respect of people with different opinions and of the environment.\"\n\nBritish Naturism traces its origins to 1891 when a short lived society called the \"Fellowship for the Naked Trust\" was formed in British India. This trust had ideals and principles very similar to many later organisations.\n\nThe Camp was the first naturist club to be established in the United Kingdom. It was set up by someone known only as Moonella and existed at a country house near Wickford in Essex between 1924 and 1927. It was later replaced by a new venue called \"The New Camp\" near St. Albans. This and several others were able to form the British Sun Bathers Association in 1943.\n\nHarold Booth published articles pertaining to naturism in many magazines at the turn of the century, and in 1922 the English Gymnosophical Society (EGS) was formed as a direct result of his work. It had a site in Wickford, Essex, which it used during the summer, and in winter it held meetings in London. By 1926 the EGS was renamed the New Gymnosophy Society and had a site at Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire which has subsequently been used by many different clubs.\n\nThe oldest club still in operation is Spielplatz which was founded in 1929 by Charles Macaskie and his wife Dorothy. It consists of 12 acres (4.9 ha) located in the village of Bricket Wood, in the English county of Hertfordshire..\n\nConcurrent to this, naturism was also practiced at the Welsh Harp in Hendon, apparently from as early as 1921. From this sprang the National Sun and Air Association which ran national advertisement campaigns, as well as running a gymnasium in Westbourne Grove, London. By 1937, membership of this society was running at over 2000.\n\nIn 1943 the British Sun Bathers Association (BSBA) was formed and became recognised as a national federation of clubs, which by 1951 had 51 member clubs or groups. However, by 1953, personal and ideological differences led to the formation of the rival Federation of British Sun Clubs (FBSC).\n\nBoth organisations existed until their merger in 1964 to create the Central Council for British Naturism (CCBN). By 2006, CCBN was usually referred to as 'British Naturism' but officially changed the name to 'British Naturism' at the 2009 AGM. In 2009, it claimed a membership of about 13,000.\n\n\nBritish Naturism has sought legal and political protection against discrimination for naturists in the United Kingdom, where an opinion poll in 2008 estimated the number of people describing themselves as naturist or nudist at 3.7 million. It also runs public facing campaigns, including \"Women in Naturism\", which encourages women to try naturist activity, \"Bare all for polar bears\" which seeks to raise money for environmental conservation and \"The Great British Skinny Dip\", which encourages costume free swimming events to be run, not just by naturist clubs, but also public pools, spas, lidos and natural settings such as lakes. \n\nIn April 2018, British Naturism announced that in discussion with the senior officer at the police college a mutually satisfactory solution was reached, and the resultant preamble and \"decision tree\" for dealing with complaints about public nudity has been uploaded to the Police Training manuals. Naturism is protected as a philosophical belief by the Equalities Act of 2010 and section 66 of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 does not apply to passive nudity. The Crown Prosecution Service issued guidance in 2013, and now serving police officers have advice online and in their training manual. Using nudity for \"intentional harassment, alarm or distress\" remains an offence under Section 4A of the Public Order Act.\n\n"}
{"id": "2276394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276394", "title": "Phenmetrazine", "text": "Phenmetrazine\n\nPhenmetrazine (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand name Preludin, and many others) was a stimulant drug that was previously used as an appetite suppressant, but has since been withdrawn from the market. The drug had been widely abused. It was initially replaced by its analogue phendimetrazine (under the brand name Prelu-2) which functions as a prodrug to phenmetrazine, but now it is rarely prescribed, due to concerns of abuse and addiction. Chemically, phenmetrazine is a substituted amphetamine with a morpholine ring.\n\nPhenmetrazine was first patented in Germany in 1952 by Boehringer-Ingelheim, with some pharmacological data published in 1954. It was the result of a search by Thomä and Wick for an anorectic drug without the side-effects of amphetamine. Phenmetrazine was introduced into clinical use in 1954 in Europe.\n\nIn clinical use, phenmetrazine produces less nervousness, hyperexcitability, euphoria and insomnia than drugs of the amphetamine family. It tends not to increase heart rate as much as other stimulants. Due to the relative lack of side effects, one study found it well tolerated in children. In a study of the effectiveness on weight loss between phenmetrazine and dextroamphetamine, phenmetrazine was found to be slightly more effective.\n\nPhenmetrazine acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine with EC values of 50.4 ± 5.4 nM and 131 ± 11 nM, respectively. It has negligible efficacy as a releaser of serotonin, with an EC value of only 7,765 ± 610 nM.\n\nAfter an oral dose, about 70% of the drug is excreted from the body within 24 hours. About 19% of that is excreted as the unmetabolised drug and the rest as various metabolites.\n\nIn trials performed on rats, it has been found that after subcutaneous administration of phenmetrazine, both optical isomers are equally effective in reducing food intake, but in oral administration the levo isomer is more effective. In terms of central stimulation however, the dextro isomer is about 4 times as effective in both methods of administration.\n\nThe salt which has been used for immediate-release formulations is phenmetrazine hydrochloride (Preludin). Sustained-release formulations were available as resin-bound, rather than soluble, salts. Both of these dosage forms share a similar bioavailability as well as time to peak onset, however, sustained-release formulations offer improved pharmacokinetics with a steady release of active ingredient which results in a lower peak concentration in blood plasma.\n\n1105 g. of 2-phenyl-3-methyl-4-(B-hydroxy ethyl) tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine are dissolved in 4000 cc. of anhydrous toluene. 910 g. of a-phenyl-u-ethyl acetic acid chloride are dissolved in 400 cc. of anhydrous toluene and the resulting solution is slowly added to the heated solution of the tetrahydro-l,4-oxazine compound. The mixture is then heated to boiling for about 5 hours. About 1000 g. of ice are added to the cooled reaction mixture which is then rendered alkaline by the addition of 20% sodium carbonate solution to a pH of 9.0. Thereafter the mixture is vigorously stirred by means of a turbine mixer for one hour and the toluene phase is separated. The toluene solution is washed with 1000 cc. of saturated sodium chloride solution and is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The toluene is then evaporated and the residue is subjected to high vacuum distillation. 1650 g. of a-phenyl-a-ethyl acetic acid-(Z-phenyl- 3-methyl tetrahydro-l,4-oxazine)-N-ethyl ester, boiling at 235-240 C./ 0.05 mm. are obtained thereby in a yield of 90.5% of the theoretical yield.\n\nIts structure incorporates the backbone of amphetamine, the prototypical CNS stimulant which, like phenmetrazine, is a releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine. The molecule also loosely resembles ethcathinone, the active metabolite of popular anorectic amfepramone (diethylpropion). Unlike phenmetrazine, ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) are mostly selective as noradrenaline releasing agents. \n\nPhenmetrazine has been used recreationally in many countries, including Sweden. When stimulant use first became prevalent in Sweden in the 1950s, phenmetrazine was preferred to amphetamine and methamphetamine by users. In the autobiographical novel \"Rush\" by Kim Wozencraft, intravenous phenmetrazine is described as the most euphoric and pro-sexual of the stimulants the author used.\n\nPhenmetrazine was classified as a narcotic in Sweden in 1959, and was taken completely off the market in 1965. At first the illegal demand was satisfied by smuggling from Germany, and later Spain and Italy. At first, Preludin tablets were smuggled, but soon the smugglers started bringing in raw phenmetrazine powder. Eventually amphetamine became the dominant stimulant of abuse because of its greater availability.\n\nPhenmetrazine was taken by the Beatles early in their career. Paul McCartney was one known user. McCartney's introduction to drugs started in Hamburg, Germany. The Beatles had to play for hours, and they were often given the drug (referred to as \"Prellies\") by the maid who cleaned their housing arrangements, German customers, or by Astrid Kirchherr (whose mother bought them). McCartney would usually take one, but John Lennon would often take four or five. Hunter Davies asserted, in his 1968 biography of the band, that their use of such stimulants then was in response to their need to stay awake and keep working, rather than a simple desire for kicks.\n\nJack Ruby said he was on phenmetrazine at the time he killed Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nPreludin was also used recreationally in the US throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. It could be crushed up in water, heated and injected. The street name for the drug in Washington, DC was \"Bam\". Phenmetrazine continues to be used and abused around the world, in countries including South Korea.\n\n"}

{"id": "2276399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276399", "title": "1996 Tour de France", "text": "1996 Tour de France\n\nThe 1996 Tour de France was the 83rd edition of the Tour de France, starting on 29 June and ending on 21 July, featuring 19 regular stages, 2 individual time trials, a prologue and a rest day (10 July). It was won by Danish rider Bjarne Riis.\n\nThis Tour was noted by the \"fall\" of favourite Miguel Indurain, ending his record run of five consecutive victories. The course included a stage through his home town Villava, however he suffered a bronchitis because of the poor weather in the first week, and was fined and penalised for accepting drinks illegally. Indurain started to lose time in stage 7, and finally ended 11th failing to win a single stage or spend one day in the yellow jersey.\n\nStage 9 was scheduled to be a 176 kilometer ride from Val-d'Isère to Sestriere. However, due to appalling weather conditions, including snow, the organisers cut the stage to just 46 km. Bjarne Riis won the stage and opened a crucial 44 second gap over Telekom teammate Jan Ullrich. Ullrich, only 22, really broke through in this Tour, and won the individual time trial of stage 20.\n\nOver a decade after the race, several riders with Team Telekom confessed to doping offences around the period of the 1996 tour, including support riders Rolf Aldag, Udo Bölts, Christian Henn and Brian Holm and team masseur Jef d'Hont has admitted in his autobiography that there was organised use of EPO in the team. On 24 May 2007, Erik Zabel admitted to using EPO during the first week of the race. The winner of the Tour, Bjarne Riis, admitted on 25 May 2007 that he also used EPO during the Tour, as a result was asked by the International Cycling Union (UCI) to return the yellow jersey he received. So far, runner-up Jan Ullrich, who has been under suspicion of doping as a part of the Operación Puerto doping case, has not commented on allegations that he also used EPO. Third place Richard Virenque and fourth place Laurent Dufaux were implicated in the 1998 Festina scandal.\n\nUCI lawyer Philippe Verbiest stated in 2007 that the statute of limitations for removing Riis as winner of the Tour de France had expired, \"you cannot strip him of the title but it possible not to mention it anymore ... Because of what he admitted, he is not the winner of the Tour de France. Riis did not win.\" At the same time tour spokesman Philippe Sudres stated that: \"We consider philosophically that he can no longer claim to have won.\" In 2007, Riis' victory was removed from the Tour de France, yet in 2008 they listed Riis as winner of Tour de France 1996, albeit with a remark about his confession.\n\nThe 18 teams on top of the UCI rankings at the start of 1996 automatically qualified for the Tour. Four wildcards were given, for a total of 22 teams.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\n\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Sestriere climb on stage 9.\n\nThe prologue was won by Alex Zülle two seconds ahead of specialist Chris Boardman as overall contenders Bjarne Riis and Miguel Indurain came in sixth and seventh respectively. Zulle held onto the yellow jersey through the first few flat stages but in stage 4 a half dozen riders not in overall contention escaped in a breakaway and stayed away finishing several minutes ahead of the main field putting Stephane Heulot in the yellow jersey for a few days.\n\nStage six was an intermediate stage run in terrible weather conditions and was won by Dutchman Michael Boogerd. The inclement weather caused well over a dozen riders to abandon the race including Lance Armstrong who merely thought he was sick from riding in the rainy, cold weather as most of the other riders who abandoned were, but within a few months he would be diagnosed with the cancer that nearly killed him.\n\nAs the Tour entered the Alps there was a mountain ITT in stage eight which was won by Evgeni Berzin, whom had seized the lead in the overall classification following stage seven. In the time trial he finished more than thirty seconds better than Riis and gained just over a minute on Indurain, Tony Rominger and debutant Jan Ullrich who was having an impressive start to his first Tour.\n\nStage nine was a mountain stage that was shortened due to foul weather and was won by Riis, who in the process took enough time to put himself into yellow. He would maintain a narrow lead over the next several stages and by the time the race reached the Pyrenees Abraham Olano was in second just under a minute behind with Berzin in third, Rominger in fourth, Riis’ teammate Ullrich in fifth and five-time defending champion Miguel Indurain struggling to stay in the top ten nearly 5:00 back.\n\nDuring stage sixteen Riis made a number of false attacks, even falling back and feigning exhaustion to get a look at Indurain, Rominger, Luttenberger, Virenque, Dufaux, Leblanc and Alano to read their faces before finally launching an attack on the Hautacam. He put close to a minute into most of the elite riders and beyond that into everybody else effectively winning the Tour and putting it beyond doubt that Indurain would not win his sixth tour.\n\nStage seventeen was won by Laurent Dufaux who in the process moved into fourth place overall, but Riis finished in the same time. A group of eight riders dropped the rest of the field in this stage and as a result Riis distanced himself from all of his rivals with his own teammate Ullrich moving into second overall and Richard Virenque moving into third place overall.\n\nStage nineteen ITT was the last opportunity for major changes to be made in the general classification and the stage was won by Ullrich who finished nearly a minute ahead of second-placed Indurain who had completely dominated Individual Times Trials at the Tour De France for the previous several years. Riis had plenty of time to spare and was 1:41 ahead of his teammate Ullrich in the General Classification. Richard Virenque rounded out the podium also winning the mountains classification.\n\nEven though rider admissions and investigations in the subsequent years showed that Tours during this time period were undoubtedly tainted by doping 1996 winner Riis, 1997 winner Ullrich and 1998 winner Pantani all officially retain their Tour victories. Pantani died just a few years after his Tour victory, as a result of mental health issues resulting from constant attacks from the press and Ullrich had some results voided later in his career, but his four 2nd place finishes to Lance Armstrong and his 1996 2nd place to Riis remain on his record.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1996 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Richard Virenque won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col d'Aubisque on stage 17. This prize was won by Neil Stephens.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276403", "title": "Crown of Scotland", "text": "Crown of Scotland\n\nThe Crown of Scotland is the crown that was used at the coronation of the monarchs of Scotland. Remade in its current form for King James V of Scotland in 1540, the crown is part of the Honours of Scotland, the oldest surviving set of Crown jewels in the British Isles. The crown dates from at least 1503 when, in an earlier form, it was depicted in the portrait of James IV of Scotland in the Book of Hours commissioned for his marriage to Margaret Tudor.\n\nIn January 1540, King James V commissioned the royal goldsmith, John Mosman, to refashion the Crown of Scotland. The existing crown was delicate and had been repaired at least twice in the previous 30 years, and a 1539 inventory showed further damage, including the loss of one fleur-de-lis. Mosman dismantled the old crown and removed its stones and pearls. The crown was melted down and Mosman added 41 ounces of gold mined at Crawford Moor in Lanarkshire.\n\nConstructed of solid gold, the crown consists of a base, with four fleur-de-lis alternating with four strawberry leaves. The four arches of the crown are decorated with gold and red oak leaves. At the intersection of the arches is a golden monde, painted blue with gold stars. The monde is surmounted by a large cross decorated in gold and black enamel and pearls. The crown is encrusted with 22 gemstones, including garnets and amethysts, 20 precious stones and 68 Scottish freshwater pearls.\n\nJames V ordered a purple and ermine bonnet from tailor Thomas Arthur of Edinburgh to fit inside the crown. James VII ordered the colour of the bonnet be changed to red. The bonnet had to be replaced several times, and the present bonnet was made in 1993. The completed crown weighs 1.64 kg (3 lb 10 oz).\n\nThe crown was first worn in the year of its manufacture by James V to the coronation at Holyrood Abbey of his second wife, Mary of Guise, as queen consort. It was subsequently used in the coronations of the child monarchs Mary I in 1543 and James VI in 1567.\n\nIn the absence of a resident Scottish monarch following the Union of the Crowns in 1603, (on James VI inheriting the thrones of England and Ireland the Royal Household relocated from Edinburgh to London), the Honours were carried to sittings of the Parliament of Scotland to symbolise the sovereign's presence and the Royal Assent to legislation.\n\nThe crown was used for the Scottish coronations of both Charles I in 1633 and Charles II in 1651. However, no subsequent monarchs of Scotland were crowned using this crown.\n\nDuring the Civil War, having already destroyed the ancient English Crown Jewels, Oliver Cromwell sought to destroy the Scottish Crown Jewels. However, the Honours were secretly buried until the monarchy was restored in 1660. \n\nFollowing the Act of Union of 1707, which unified the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, and having no ceremonial role to play in the proceedings of the new Parliament of Great Britain in London, the Honours were locked away in Edinburgh Castle. There they remained all but forgotten in a chest until 1818, when a group of people including Sir Walter Scott set out to find them. Since 1819 they have been on display in the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle from where they are removed only for state occasions. The first was when presented to King George IV, at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in 1822, during his visit to Scotland (the first visit to Scotland by a reigning monarch since 1651).\n\nOn 24 June 1953, following her coronation at Westminster Abbey, the crown was carried before Queen Elizabeth II in a procession from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to the High Kirk of St Giles, Edinburgh, where the Honours of Scotland, including the crown, were presented to The Queen during a National Service of Thanksgiving. \n\nMore recently, the crown has been present at the official opening ceremonies of sessions of the Scottish Parliament, including the first in 1999 and the official opening of the new Scottish Parliament Building in 2004. On such occasions the crown, carried by the Duke of Hamilton, the hereditary bearer of the Crown of Scotland, immediately precedes Her Majesty The Queen in the custom of the ancient opening ceremonial procession known as the \"Riding of Parliament\".\n\nAs well as appearing in the Royal coat of arms of the UK used in Scotland and Scottish versions of the Royal Cypher, the crown appears in the version of the UK royal arms used by the Scotland Office, and also appeared in the arms used by the former Scottish Executive.\n\nStylised versions of the crown appear upon the badges of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, The Royal British Legion Scotland, the Scottish Ambulance Service, Police Scotland and, (As part of the Crest of the Royal Arms), upon the logos of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, RCAHMS, and General Register Office for Scotland. \n\nA version of the crown is used upon Royal Mail premises, vehicles and Scottish pillar, lamp and wall boxes, and a metal insert plate showing the Crown of Scotland also appears on model K6 red telephone boxes in Scotland.\n\nFrom 1927 until its abolition in 1975, the arms of Kincardineshire County Council featured the crown, together with the sword and sceptre, above an artist's rendering of Dunnottar Castle, to mark the county's status as the 17th century hiding place of the Honours of Scotland during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nThe Crown of Scotland also appears on maritime flags, including the Blue Ensign of vessels belonging to Marine Scotland, (Compliance Division), and also upon the burgees of certain Royal yacht clubs in Scotland including, for example, that of the Royal Scottish Motor Yacht Club.\n\nFrom 1968 to 2008, the reverse of the Five pence coin, minted for circulation throughout the United Kingdom, featured the Royal Badge of Scotland; a thistle surmounted by the Crown of Scotland.\n\nThe crown, as a component of the Royal Badge of Scotland, (A Thistle Royally Crowned), appeared on a 'Regional' series of definitive, pre-decimal Royal Mail stamps, during the period 1958 to 1970.\n\nIn 2003 a new crown was made for the Lord Lyon, modelled on the Crown of Scotland. This crown has removable arches (like one of the late Queen Mother's crowns) which will be removed at coronations to avoid any hint of lèse majesté.\n\n\n"}

Functional harmony tends to rely heavily on the primary triads: triads built on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant degrees.

{"id": "2276409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276409", "title": "Steel frame", "text": "Steel frame\n\nSteel frame is a building technique with a \"skeleton frame\" of vertical steel columns and horizontal -beams, constructed in a rectangular grid to support the floors, roof and walls of a building which are all attached to the frame. The development of this technique made the construction of the skyscraper possible.\n\nThe rolled steel \"profile\" or cross section of steel columns takes the shape of the letter \"\". The two wide flanges of a column are thicker and wider than the flanges on a beam, to better withstand compressive stress in the structure. Square and round tubular sections of steel can also be used, often filled with concrete. Steel beams are connected to the columns with bolts and threaded fasteners, and historically connected by rivets. The central \"web\" of the steel -beams is often wider than a column web to resist the higher bending moments that occur in beams.\n\nWide sheets of steel deck can be used to cover the top of the steel frame as a \"form\" or corrugated mold, below a thick layer of concrete and steel reinforcing bars. Another popular alternative is a floor of precast concrete flooring units with some form of concrete topping. Often in office buildings, the final floor surface is provided by some form of raised flooring system with the void between the walking surface and the structural floor being used for cables and air handling ducts.\n\nThe frame needs to be protected from fire because steel softens at high temperature and this can cause the building to partially collapse. In the case of the columns this is usually done by encasing it in some form of fire resistant structure such as masonry, concrete or plasterboard. The beams may be cased in concrete, plasterboard or sprayed with a coating to insulate it from the heat of the fire or it can be protected by a fire-resistant ceiling construction. Asbestos was a popular material for fireproofing steel structures up until the early 1970s, before the health risks of asbestos fibres were fully understood.\n\nThe exterior \"skin\" of the building is anchored to the frame using a variety of construction techniques and following a huge variety of architectural styles. Bricks, stone, reinforced concrete, architectural glass, sheet metal and simply paint have been used to cover the frame to protect the steel from the weather.\n\nCold-formed steel frames are also known as lightweight steel framing (LSF).\n\nThin sheets of galvanized steel can be cold formed into steel studs for use as a structural or non-structural building material for both external and partition walls in both residential, commercial and industrial construction projects (pictured). The dimension of the room is established with horizontal track that is anchored to the floor and ceiling to outline each room. The vertical studs are arranged in the tracks, usually spaced apart, and fastened at the top and bottom.\n\nThe typical profiles used in residential construction are the C-shape stud and the U-shaped track, and a variety of other profiles. Framing members are generally produced in a thickness of 12 to 25 gauge. Heavy gauges, such as 12 and 14 gauge, are commonly used when axial loads (parallel to the length of the member) are high, such as in load-bearing construction. Medium-heavy gauges, such as 16 and 18 gauge, are commonly used when there are no axial loads but heavy lateral loads (perpendicular to the member) such as exterior wall studs that need to resist hurricane-force wind loads along coasts. Light gauges, such as 25 gauge, are commonly used where there are no axial loads and very light lateral loads such as in interior construction where the members serve as framing for demising walls between rooms. The wall finish is anchored to the two flange sides of the stud, which varies from thick, and the width of web ranges from . Rectangular sections are removed from the web to provide access for electrical wiring.\n\nSteel mills produce galvanized sheet steel, the base material for the manufacture of cold-formed steel profiles. Sheet steel is then roll-formed into the final profiles used for framing. The sheets are zinc coated (galvanized) to prevent oxidation and corrosion. Steel framing provides excellent design flexibility due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of steel, which allows it to span over a long distances, and also resist wind and earthquake loads.\n\nSteel-framed walls can be designed to offer excellent thermal and acoustic properties – one of the specific considerations when building using cold-formed steel is that thermal bridging can occur across the wall system between the outside environment and interior conditioned space. Thermal bridging can be protected against by installing a layer of externally fixed insulation along the steel framing – typically referred to as a 'thermal break'.\n\nThe spacing between studs is typically 16 inches on center for homes exterior and interior walls depending on designed loading requirements. In office suites the spacing is on center for all walls except for elevator and staircasewells.\n\nThe use of steel for structural purposes was initially slow. The Bessemer process in 1855 made steel production more efficient, and cheap steels, which had high tensile and compressive strengths plus good ductility were available from about 1870, but wrought and cast iron continued to satisfy most of the demand for iron-based building products, due mainly to problems of producing steel from alkaline ores. These problems, caused principally by the presence of phosphorus, were solved by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas in 1879.\n\nIt was not until 1880 that an era of construction based on reliable mild steel began. By that date the quality of steels being produced had become reasonably consistent.\n\nThe Home Insurance Building, completed in 1885, was the first to use skeleton frame construction, completely removing the load bearing function of its masonry cladding. In this case the iron columns are merely embedded in the walls, and their load carrying capacity appears to be secondary to the capacity of the masonry, particularly for wind loads. In the United States, the first steel framed building was the Rand McNally Building in Chicago, erected in 1890.\n\nThe Royal Insurance Building in Liverpool designed by James Francis Doyle in 1895 (erected 1896-1903) was the first to use a steel frame in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}

The album made the top 10 in the US (No. 6) and UK (No. 10). The album was certified triple platinum by the RIAA on 7 September 2001. The album was produced by Tim Palmer, Robert Plant and Phil Johnstone.\n\nWith a new band and a new perspective on his music, Plant returned in late 1987 with more of the sound that had previously defined him in Led Zeppelin. Although Plant continued to utilize computerized audio technology in a similar fashion to his previous solo albums, for this album Plant integrated the blues that had all but been abandoned on his most recent album \"Shaken 'n' Stirred\" (1985). A prominent guitar sound and an exotic feel to the recordings also marked another change in direction for the artist, who now added Middle Eastern tones in songs like \"Heaven Knows\". This is a direction that he would eventually follow in the 1990s with Page and Plant.\n\nThe tracks \"Heaven Knows\" and \"Tall Cool One\" feature Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. (On the liner notes, Page's participation on the songs is noted with a Zoso symbol.) In response to the Beastie Boys' unauthorized sampling of some Led Zeppelin songs on their 1986 album \"Licensed to Ill\", Plant also used samples from Led Zeppelin songs (\"Whole Lotta Love\", \"Dazed and Confused\", \"Black Dog\", \"Custard Pie\", and \"The Ocean\") on \"Tall Cool One\", additionally singing words from \"When the Levee Breaks\".\n\nThe original released copies of the CD and Album version contained a wolf motif mini-flag in satin red. This is a tribute to his favorite association football team, the Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves by fans). This mini-flag is also a rare collector's item. \"Walking Towards Paradise\" was originally as a bonus track available only on CD versions of the album and as the B-side of the single \"Heaven Knows\". Rhino Entertainment released a remastered edition of the album, with bonus tracks, on 3 April 2007.\n\n\"Now and Zen\" was received positively by both Plant's fans and professional music critics. In a contemporary review for \"Rolling Stone\", Kurt Loder hailed \"Now and Zen\" as \"some kind of stylistic event: a seamless pop fusion of hard guitar rock, gorgeous computerization and sharp, startling songcraft.\" Robert Christgau found it superior to his previous two attractive but forgettable solo albums, writing in \"The Village Voice\" that \"at its best, it's far from forgettable. Overall effect is a cross between his former band and the Cars.\" \n\nIn an interview he gave to \"Uncut\" magazine in 2005, Plant commented that \"by the time \"Now and Zen\" came out in '88, it looked like I was big again. It was a Top 10 album on both sides of the Atlantic.

{"id": "2276452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276452", "title": "WWIVnet", "text": "WWIVnet\n\nWWIVnet was a Bulletin board system (BBS) network for WWIV-based BBSes. It was created by Wayne Bell on December 1, 1987. The system was similar to FidoNet in purpose, but used a very different routing mechanism that was more automated and distributed.\n\nWWIVnet consisted of several participating BBSes, each referenced by a unique number called a node number. Originally, WWIVnet nodes were numbered by area code. The format was TXYZZ, where X and Y were the first and last digits of the area code, and ZZ was a number that ranged from 00 to 49 in area codes with a middle digit of 0, or a number between 50-99 in area codes with a middle digit of 1. The T portion of the node number was only used if a particular area code ran out of node numbers in their assigned range and needed more, the T would become 1. Thus, node 5802 would be a node in the 508 area code, and node 12263 would be a node in a very busy 212 area code. This numbering system worked well until the telephone systems began using area codes that used numbers other than 1 or 0 as the middle digit. When this occurred, WWIVnet realized it had to change its numbering system so a group based system was adopted, where node numbers would change to an XZZZ system. In this system, X would be the group number, and ZZZ would be the system number under that group.\n\nThe network's administration was set up where every area code had an Area Coordinator (AC) which was responsible for maintaining information about the nodes in their area code. The AC reported to the Group Coordinator (GC), which was responsible for updating the node lists for the area codes under them. The GC reported to the Network Coordinator (NC), who was responsible for sending out node list updates. The NC was the person who was ultimately in charge of WWIVnet.\n\nThe network structure, however, had everything to do with administration but nothing to do with the way traffic was transmitted. Simply put the only way to control the flow of data was to reduce the number of nodes on the network the system connected to. If two nodes were connected and it was the closest possible route for other nodes the traffic would follow that route. So if a node wanted to stop through traffic then they would connect to a single node for all traffic. There was no other form of traffic control on the network. Connection weight although added to the network data record was never implemented. If a specific route went down, the network would automatically try to reroute the packets in the next fastest route it could calculate. This method was an early version of peer-to-peer file sharing and may be the first instance of this type of file sharing. Note that while FidoNet was created before WWIVnet and transmitted files between systems, it did not use a peer-to-peer system because the traffic was routed using a set hierarchical model and servers (hubs/feeds) controlled all traffic. Wayne Bell referred to the networking method used by WWIVnet as a grid, similar to mesh networking, and often said he based it on Usenet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276453", "title": "The Organ (band)", "text": "The Organ (band)\n\nThe Organ was a Canadian post-punk band formed in 2001 in Vancouver, British Columbia. They officially broke up on December 7, 2006, due to illness and personal conflicts in the band.\n\nThe Organ were conceived in 2001 by frontwoman Katie Sketch, born Katie Ritchie, in Vancouver, BC. Sketch's musical training started at the age of three, when she began classical training on the violin. Her childhood was spent largely in ignorance of the underground sounds of The Smiths, The Cure, and Joy Division, whom The Organ would later often be favorably compared to. \"Tiffany and Bon Jovi – that was my take on ’80s music.\"\n\nSketch has said of the time of the formation of the band, when she and the band members were in their early to mid-twenties. \"I was in a musical lull, I couldn’t stand what I was listening to,\" naming Sleater-Kinney as one example. “The local scene was also pretty shitty, and of course the radio was brutal. Then, by total fluke, my mom’s friend’s husband, Ron Obvious, hired me to help with the audio wiring for a studio he was building for Bryan Adams.” Obvious introduced Katie to the world of independent music, and what she calls \"that ’80s sound.\" He created mix-tapes of bands he thought she’d appreciate as a violinist (Roxy Music, Ultravox) and singers with an \"amazing natural vocal pitch\" (Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nina Hagen, Kate Bush)). This job also led Sketch to Tara Nelson, the engineer who would later record the Organ’s first EP.\n\nIt was at this time that Katie joined with her friends Sarah \"Sketch\" Efron (on bass and keyboards) and Barb \"Sketch\" Choit (Hammond organ, guitar, bass) to form the instrumental trio Full Sketch.\n\n\"I met Katie Sketch when we worked morning shifts at a wretched cinnamon bun shop,\" says Efron, \"but we really became friends on a road trip where we ended up breaking down in the redneck town of Hermiston, Oregon. On this trip, we decided to form a band and call it Full Sketch.\" Katie, though she was already a proficient multi-instrumentalist, decided this would be a good time to try her hand at drums.\n\n\"The concept was, 'Let's start a band where you play an instrument that you've never played before.' It was basically drunken ridiculousness, but all of a sudden I felt like life made more sense. Sarah was involved in CiTR, and Barb was big into indie rock, so what started off as a joke got me out going to see shows. The way The Organ began was as an offshoot of Full Sketch—I wanted to take the same sound and do it with singing.\"\n\nEfron was also the news director at UBC’s CiTR, where she, Sketch and Choit co-hosted a raunchy late-night call-in program called \"The Dead Air Show.\"\n\nAfter about a year, Barb Sketch left the band to focus on her career as an artist and Full Sketch ended. According to Katie Sketch, \"Barb Sketch is now in suburban California. She’s long forgotten her Canadian roots and lives on a ranch with her man and a team of horses.\" At this point, organist Jenny Smyth (born Genoa Smith), replaced Choit on keyboards. Together with Efron, they founded The Organ.\n\nIn 2001, a long audition process began. Eventually, Sketch \"tired of auditions,\" and decided to \"just hire some people.\" After finding a handful of like-minded musicians, Katie assigned them instruments and taught them to play. Taught is a relative term though—Debbie had been playing guitar for three years, and Sketch has expressed distaste in interviews when portrayed as a \"music teacher\" to the girls: \"[The press seems] to think they had a lot of help or something, but mostly it's just the drive to be able to learn the instruments and play them,\" Sketch said. \"[My teaching them] was maybe a half-an-hour, hour process.\"\n\nThe full formation of the band that would appear on their first EP took three years. \"It’s not like the five of us got together and spontaneously created this,\" Sketch once commented in an interview. \"Jenny and I had a direction we wanted to go in and then we slowly recruited people. We could tell if someone didn’t get it, which is why we had to get rid of so many players. It’s funny, sometimes people say the band’s moving really quickly, but I feel like I’ve been doing this forever.\"\n\nThe original group eventually rounded out with Katie, Jenny, Sarah, drummer Shelby Stocks, and guitarist Debora Cohen. In summer 2002, The Organ made their debut with the release of the \"Sinking Hearts\" EP. The Canadian press and indie publications across America praised The Organ's dreampop-inflected presentation. By January, The Organ was signed to Chad Kroeger's 604 imprint and Mint Records. However, before the year was out, Efron would leave to focus on her journalism career and be replaced by Ashley Webber.\n\n\"The rock n’ roll lifestyle wasn’t for me,\" said Efron, who is currently working for the financial section of \"The National Post\", a conservative Canadian newspaper.\n\nEven with the band finally complete and their first EP released, it would take years before they would release their first proper album; the process of writing and recording (the album would end up being pieced together in four different studios) would take years—two, to be exact, to finish up as \"Grab That Gun\", an album that barely breaks a half hour in length and recycles four of its eleven tracks from \"Sinking Hearts\".\n\n\"We knew we had a problem when the album was being mixed,\" comments Cohen. \"When we heard it, we knew that it didn't sound like us. It was too, I don't know, crisp.\"\n\nAfter much agonizing, the Organ decided to scrap the Dahle sessions and rerecord the album with producer Paul Forgues, who Sketch knew from her days at the Warehouse Studio.\n\n\"It was a really, really hard choice to make,\" Stocks says. \"We had a window where we could have just released something that we weren't totally happy with. There was so much hype at that time, but we were like, 'No way. Let's fuck the hype and start over.' And I think that we ended up with a great album. I know that people who like us for being amateur and really simple are going to get it.\"\n\nDespite numerous set-backs, their five years of slow going had produced a relatively sizable fan-following, and their new material showed even more promise than their first EP, which had done very well indeed, especially for a record that had gone largely unpromoted. As such, \"Grab That Gun\" spent more time on top of the Canadian campus-radio charts than any other record released that year.\n\nThat December (2004), Ashley Webber left the band.\n\n\"I think it's the usual reasons,\" explained Sketch in an interview. \"I mean, I love Ashley, but we had different ideas. And then she wanted to try being in other musical projects, and we support her in that … [but our band has] got to be a high priority, I guess that's what it comes down to.\"\n\nHowever, with their first international tour looming and no replacement in sight, Webber was asked back and subsequently rejoined the band in the new year.\n\nThe Organ began touring heavily across Canada, the United States and Europe. They also produced a music video for \"Brother,\" (directed by Robert Morfitt) arguably the strongest of the seven new tracks appearing on the record. The video consisted of a fairly straightforward montage of the band performing on a moodily lit stage. A fictitious reenactment of the video shoot for \"Brother\" can be seen during season two, episode two of the Showtime original series \"The L Word\". \"Brother\" also appears on \"The L Word\"'s season two soundtrack.\n\nFollowing the well received promotion of \"Brother,\" The Organ began production on the far more ambitious \"Memorize the City\" video, which depicted a dizzying tour through a city of sound, light, and color. The higher artistic standard and production quality of this video reflects an amazing amount of growth for the band in a very short period, and is very impressive considering that it was shot at a time when the band was engaged in the biggest tour of their careers. That July (2005) the standalone 7\" single, \"Let the Bells Ring\", was released on Go Metric Records. The title track was paired with a remix of \"Memorize the City\" by Dustin Hawthorne. Later that year, a second remix appeared on the French CD release of \"Grab That Gun\".\n\nDuring another North American tour promoting \"Grab That Gun\", Ashley Webber left for good. She was then replaced with Katie Sketch's sister, Shmoo, who affirmed that she was \"definitely permanent in the band\" before it broke up in 2006.\n\nOn November 14, 2005, The Organ appeared live on BBC Radio 6 Music with their new bass player. They gave a brief interview and performed live renditions of the songs \"Nothing I Can Do\" and \"Love, Love, Love.\" On the 27th, a little over a week later, The Organ announced via their website that they had just been signed to Too Pure Records, through which \"Grab That Gun\" would be available throughout the world in February 2006.\n\nThe album cover was designed by David Cuesta at 7th Avenue house, and is based on a grid constructed around the Fibonacci sequence, to match musical scales. He also designed the logo based on sketches by Katie and Jenny.\n\nOn 23 August 2006, the band released a statement on MySpace saying they were canceling the remaining portion of their UK tour which included dates at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reason given was illness to a band member and they assured fans the band were not splitting up.\n\nOn 7 December 2006 the band released a statement on their MySpace and official site stating that they were breaking up. The statement read:\n\nIn an interview on CBC Radio 3 the following day, Jenny declined to discuss the reasons for the breakup saying that there were issues they preferred to keep private but implied that it had little or nothing to do with either geography or Katie's modeling career. \"There were,\" she said, \"so many reasons,\" she \"wouldn't know where to start.\"\n\nTwo years later, Katie Sketch would later go on to detail the full story behind the break-up in a 2008 interview:\n\n\"When the band ended, I was really burnt out. I thought if I took a few months off then I wouldn't be burnt out, but now, when I think about it, I wouldn't have the energy to do touring right now. I just feel absolutely exhausted with it, and band politics, and all that stuff. I am still writing music, but it's not my first priority any more. [My first priority now is] getting my life back together. We'd been touring for so long and working so hard that I didn't know how to function on a daily basis. So just little things, like, I'm going to have breakfast today, or I'm going to the gym, or I'm going to get a job. I didn't really have any concept of how to do it any more […] I spent the majority of my twenties wanting to be in a band and it's all I ever thought about. And by the time the band ended I was in really bad health. Like drinking was a problem, and not knowing how to deal with personal crises. I was in bad shape. […] If a band is really supportive of one another and can help each other through things, it works really well, but at the end we were completely unable to communicate. We'd all become self-deprecating, we were fighting all the time... we were basically just drunk all the time. We had no time to separate, so it was like being in a bad domestic situation, all the time. […] When you're five girls touring in really terrible circumstances, where you're all in the same van and all sleep in the same hotel room every night, and you're drinking a lot, you have a lot of really fun times, but there's always fighting, there's always something going on. Towards the end, where things were becoming irreparable, it got to the point where we should have been in therapy as a group. And we should have taken breaks. And I knew that, and I was pushing for that. But the way our career had gone, we released the record in Canada, then somewhere else, then somewhere else, touring the same record. It was staggered, so we were always touring where the fanbase was hearing it for the first time. We built it like that, which is how a lot of bands do it, but it was gruelling. […] We were at that point where everyone in a band wants to get, right where the financial stuff isn't going to be such a big deal, where we'd be able to tour and take personal space, but our relationships had deteriorated so much by that point. […] It's like, you're doing everything that you dreamed of your whole life, and yet you've never been more miserable. You can't get away from these people. It's like you're married to them, basically. And we had other problems as well. What I consider to be a major part of our break-up is that this whole entire time that we were touring and doing all the stuff, we were never signed in the States. And to not have a record label in the States is to not have a career. We live in Canada so it's right there, but whenever we'd play in the States it would be to nobody. So we worked really, really hard to get a label in the States and when we finally had label interest there, and a label we wanted to sign to, our Canadian record label, who own our record, wouldn't let us go with what we wanted to do. It felt like we'd been busting our asses for however long, and we felt like we had no control. So what was going to happen? We'd finally sign in the States when I was 35, and we'd do gruelling tours then? You know what I mean? That was a major knock-down for us.\n\n[…] By the end, I feel like everybody in the band was mentally ill. […] Quite frankly, I was not mentally well. […] I needed to get away from it, or something really bad was going to happen. […] We really needed a break and the record label, everybody, was pushing, pushing, pushing. And there's always the feeling that you're in financial debt too. The more you do it, the more money you make, and we felt like we owed it to people. And that's how management and the record company played it - \"you kind of owe it to us to do another tour right now.\n\n[After the breakup,] I moved to Toronto, had a mental breakdown, then I just got a job working for a doctor […] I interview people with drug problems, and alcoholics. […] Jenny the organ player just moved to Toronto and she and I bought a restaurant bar about two months ago. We're renovating it and we live above it in a teeny weeny apartment together. […] It'll be a brunch place in the day, and we have a liquor license so it will be a bar at night. [Now that Jenny and I live together,] it's constantly like, \"Remember the time when we...\" and we'll laugh and it's hilarious. So the whole thing wasn't horrible. It's not like I'm saying \"don't start a band\". I'm just saying, you've got to set your personal boundaries, as far as touring goes. As far as the grind. It's really important to take a break and we never got one.\"\n\nLess than two years after their breakup, the band released one last EP of unreleased material titled, \"Thieves\", on October 14, 2008. In the same October 16 interview where she would finally reveal the reasons behind the band's breakup, Katie Sketch would give insight into the motivating factors which caused the band to reunite in the studio one last time.\n\n\"I had heard a rumor that my record label was going to release songs that we hadn't released, from some demo recording we had done earlier. I was not happy with that. At all. Threatening isn't the right word, but I heard they were thinking about releasing it. So I freaked out, and during that freak-out period I realized that I really like the songs. People have been writing us, fans, asking about the songs, so I thought we should record them while we still remember them. […] I can only speak for myself, but I found that [the recording process for the \"Thieves\" EP] was extremely emotionally draining. I made sure we did it under our own terms. I had a friend who engineered it and we did it at my mum's house in BC. She lives on this island, so it was really relaxed. And we did it in stages so the band was never there at the same time, so we couldn't fall back into the band dynamic because \"the band\" was never there. I gave my friend strict instructions, like, sit in the back seat and don't offer any opinion. We need it to be the easiest session ever, because people are really sensitive, and if one person says, \"Fuck this, I'm leaving,\" then it won't work. So we did it like that. [Having to release the EP on the same record label] is fine. I've really separated myself from the situation. But that sort of thing, being bound by a contract, straight up, that's a major obstacle in my desire to do music any more.\"\n\nSince the band's breakup in 2006, several of the members have gone on to pursue solo projects.\n\nDebora Cohen released demo tracks under the name, \"Lovers Love Haters\", which she renamed \"Dancer in the Dark\", with additional single releases.\n\nShmoo Ritchie fronted Vancouver hardcore band, \"Keep Tidy\". She created a project, \"Die Cowboy Die\", and released a 5-track eponymous album and a 7-track album, \"All Caps\" (2011).\n\nA video of Katie Sketch performing with a new band called \"Mermaids\" as early as October 31, 2007 has surfaced on the internet too. Sketch has publicly stated that she fully intends to release a solo effort, but that legal complications have thus far prevented the band from officially releasing any music. According to Sketch:\n\n\"I feel like, OK, so I'm going to write a solo record and pour every part of myself into it, and I won't have control over where it's released in the United States again? [With regard to the possibility of releasing solo material independently,] I'm arguably bound by contract. […] It's seriously debatable and is being debated and has been for the last two years. I like to think that I'm not, and they like to think that I am. And that stress alone, honestly, keeps me from sitting down and working on music. I have no control over my own career. […] I can play live, but when it comes to releasing a record, they've straight up said to me, if you release any music you will be sued. And that kind of pressure, after all the work that I've done, really isn't like anything I need in my life right now.\"\n\nKatie Sketch is now performing with Gentleman Reg and has been seen in some shows at the Gladstone Hotel and the Beaver in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nIn 2008, along with former Organ member Jenny Smyth, Sketch opened a gay-friendly Toronto bar and hang-out, The Henhouse. As of November 2016, Katie is the guitarist of a Toronto-based all-female band, Vag Halen. She now goes professionally by the name Katie Ritchie.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They live in the valleys, on the plateaus and slopes, and on the adjacent plains of the region. Their neighbors include the Toposa, the Boya, Ketebo, Logir, Teuth and Dongotona peoples - groups with whom the Didinga have had frequent conflicts due to economic pressures.\n\nThe Didinga, Boya, Tennet, Murle and Mursi of Southwest Ethiopia share a language that distinguishes them from all other groups in the Sudan. Their language, often called the Murle-Didinga language, is also spoken by a group living in southwest Ethiopia. The Didinga claim to have lived in southwest Ethiopia two hundred years ago. During their migration to the Didinga Hills, the Didinga, Murle, Tennet and Boya were one group. They lived in harmony in Sudan until a hunting-party dispute caused the Murle to leave. Later, a famine caused the Boya to withdraw. Today, though the groups have separated, their language remains the same. Their most urban town is Chukudum, a historic town that hosted the first Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) National Convention in 1994.\n\nDuring the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005) tensions with the Dinka people built up after the Dinka-dominated SPLA forces moved into the area in 1985.\nThey came to a head in 1999 when the Didinga officer Peter Lorot was passed over for promotion in favor of a Dinka, assassinated his rival and took to the woods with his supporters.\nThe fighting with Lorot's forces displaced about 16,800 people from Chukudum to nearby villages in the highlands. The \"Chukudom Crisis\" was resolved in August 2002 during a Peace Conference organized by the New Sudan Council of Churches.\nAn attempt by the SPLA in June 2006 to disarm Lorot's militia was ignored, with the group threatening to start fighting again.\n\nFor many years, the Didinga enjoyed a quiet, rural life. They took great pride in raising cattle and owned large herds that were supervised by the young single Didinga men. However, in 1963, a political disturbance which lasted until 1973 caused many Didinga to leave their cattle behind and to migrate to Uganda. While in Uganda, for the first time in their lives, Didinga were exposed to large-scale farming. Also, their children were introduced to education. These experiences created in the people the desires to make money and to gain knowledge, things which had been unimportant in the Hills.\n\nWhen they returned to Sudan in 1973, the people were filled with a new vision for a more advanced life. They hoped to incorporate into their own culture many of the ideas and concepts they had learned in Uganda. They were met, however, with a drastic decrease in the numbers in their herds: clansmen who had remained in the Hills had failed to restock the cattle during the disturbance. Today, many Didinga are still working to enlarge their herds. They purchase cattle either through the exchange of grain or beer, or with money.\n\nAt present, farming and the desire for an education are as important to the Didinga as the herding of cattle is. The traditional values associated with raising cattle remain embedded in all Didinga. Many still take great pleasure in owning large herds. Their new-found hope for change that was brought back from their temporary migration also remains instilled in their daily lives.\nThe Didinga use their cattle not only as a means of wealth, but also for their milk that is consumed daily and made into butter. Didinga also consume fresh blood drawn from the necks of cattle with miniature arrows. The Didinga do not fish at all, because the eating of fish is taboo in their culture.\n\nThe Didinga live in scattered homesteads, with each clan grouped together. Homes are round with cone-shaped roofs. During certain seasons and during grazing periods, the Didinga also live in rustic camps.\nAn important aspect of Didinga society is the organization of 'Nyekerehet' (age-grades) for boys. Every three to five years, boys who are around eight years old are placed together to form a new \"age-grade.\" These boys work and play together until they are married.\n\nTheir traditional beliefs and religious practices include having a tribal rainmaker who is entrusted with performing certain rituals to bring rain. Didinga also worship and sacrifice to spirits and gods and place great importance upon the worship of dead ancestors.\n"}
{"id": "2276461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276461", "title": "The Blue Castle", "text": "The Blue Castle\n\nThe Blue Castle is a 1926 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery, best known for her novel \"Anne of Green Gables\" (1908).\n\nThe story takes place prior to World War I in the fictional town of Deerwood, located in the Muskoka region of Ontario, Canada. Deerwood is based on Bala, Ontario, which Montgomery visited in 1922. Maps of the two towns show similarities.\n\nThis novel is considered one of L.M. Montgomery's few adult works of fiction, along with \"A Tangled Web\", and is the only book she wrote that is entirely set outside of Prince Edward Island. It has grown in popularity since being republished in 1990. The book was adapted for the stage twice; in 1982 it was made into a successful Polish musical and ten years later Canadian playwright Hank Stinson authored another version, \"The Blue Castle: A Musical Love Story\".\n\nThe Thorn Birds author Colleen McCullough evidently used \"The Blue Castle\" as the basis of her novel \"The Ladies of Missalonghi\"—subconsciously, as she alleged—to the point of provoking accusations of plagiarism.\n\nThe book's United States copyright was renewed in 1954.\n\nValancy Stirling is twenty-nine, unmarried (and thus considered an \"old maid\") and has lived her entire life with her nagging mother and gossip-minded extended family who actively discourage happiness and treat Valancy like a child. She retreats from her unhappy circumstances with flights of imaginative fantasy, centering on a fairy-tale Blue Castle. When Valancy is diagnosed with a terminal heart ailment, she hides it from her family and, at the same time, realizes she has never been happy in her life, so she rebels against the colorless life that her family has always imposed on her. She begins by judging them objectively and worse, telling them exactly what she thinks, causing the Stirling clan to conclude that Valancy has suddenly lost her mind.\n\nValancy decides to move out of her mother's house and take a position as a housekeeper for a friend of hers who is now gravely ill, Cissy Gay. Cissy and Valancy had known each other as children, but Cissy became ostracized from society for having a child out of wedlock and on account of her father, Roaring Abel, and his reckless, usually drunken behavior. Cissy and Valancy share a room and rebuild their friendship. Valancy enjoys being paid a salary and spends her money in ways her family would not approve, such as purchasing a brightly colored, low-necked dress. She also begins spending time with Barney Snaith, who visits often as a friend to Roaring Abel and Cissy, but who the townspeople are convinced is a criminal and/or the father of Cissy's illegitimate child, now deceased.\n\nJust before the end of her life, Cissy confides in Valancy about the man she fell in love with. He offered to marry her when she told him she was pregnant, but she refused because she saw that he did not love her any more. Her baby compensated for her heartbreak, but when her baby died, she was devastated. Cissy eventually passes away, and Valancy's family expects her to move back home, having magnanimously decided to forgive her recent behavior. They are momentarily appeased when Valancy agrees that she is definitely not staying with Roaring Abel; however, she does not plan to move back home. Instead, she proposes to Barney, an outrageous action given the time in which she lives, telling him that she is dying and just wants to enjoy the remaining time she has left. She confesses that she has fallen in love with him but tells him that she does not expect him to feel the same. He agrees to marry her. Valancy's family is horrified that she has married such a disreputable man (even though none of them can say anything he has \"actually\" done wrong) and effectively disowns her.\n\nBarney takes Valancy to his home on a wooded island, which Valancy comes to see as being very like the Blue Castle she used to escape to in her imagination, and together they get along very well, though he forbids her to enter a certain room in the house. They share wonderful conversations and take long walks on the island, and she quotes to him from books by her favorite author, John Foster, who writes about the great beauty of nature. Foster's books were one of the few enjoyments allowed to her when Valancy lived with her family. They celebrate Christmas, and he gives her a necklace of pearl beads.\n\nJust as the year she was given to live is almost over, Valancy gets her shoe stuck in a train track and is nearly killed by an oncoming train. Barney saves her in the nick of time, risking his own life to do so. After the shock passes, Valancy realizes that she should have died because the doctor had told her any sudden shock would kill her. Barney is likewise stunned by the experience because he realizes that he has come to love Valancy, who, he believes, must soon die from her heart condition. Instead of telling Valancy how he feels, he retreats to his beloved woods to think. Valancy assumes that he has left because, having married her out of pity, he now realizes he is trapped in a marriage he doesn't want. Valancy goes back to the doctor, who realizes that he sent Valancy a letter with a diagnosis meant for a Miss \"Sterling\", who did have a fatal heart condition; Valancy's condition was never serious.\n\nAs she arrives home from the doctor, with Barney still away, she finds a gaudily dressed man waiting near their home. He introduces himself as Barney's father, Dr. Redfern, the millionaire who invented Redfern's Purple Pills and other patent medicines. Years ago, Barney left town abruptly without word to his father, who had no way of tracking him down until Barney withdrew $15,000 from his bank account to buy Valancy's necklace, alerting his father to his whereabouts. Barney's father wants him to come back to him, as Barney is the only family he has. Thinking that Barney believes she tricked him into marriage, Valancy decides to leave him and return to her mother's house so he can be free. While searching for a pencil to write Barney an explanatory note, she goes into his secret room and finds that he is also John Foster, the author of her favorite books. She writes the note and leaves behind the necklace.\n\nValancy reveals to her family that Barney is a millionaire and the son of the famous Dr. Redfern, as well as the noted literary figure John Foster to boot. Barney's millionaire status instantly erases any misgivings her family had about him, and they are determined that Barney and Valancy must stay together. Barney rushes to the house to see Valancy and asks her to come back. At first she refuses, believing that he is only asking her out of pity. When he becomes angry at her, thinking that she is refusing him because she is ashamed of his father's patent medicine business, she realizes he does really love her and agrees to come back to him. At the ending, Barney tells Valancy how much he loves her and how badly he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. The book closes with Valancy and Barney getting ready to leave on a global trip for further adventures while her \"own Blue Castle,\" their home on Barney's small island, will be waiting for their return.\n‘Almost all editions of The Blue Castle lack dust jackets. The true first edition does not have a castle on the front boards, it was added after Montgomery commented on it, \"Not so pretty. A plain cover.\"\n\n\nLucy Maud Montgomery and Bala\n"}

One day, they go for a walk in the wood and discover an enormous tree whose branches seem to reach into the clouds. This is the Faraway Tree.\n\nWhen the children climb the Faraway Tree they discover it is a very strange tree, such as one which grows apples and pears, nuts, acorns and oak leaves and all sorts! Different magical creatures, including Moon-Face, Silky the fairy, The Saucepan Man, Dame Washalot, Mr. Watzisname and the Angry Pixie live there. They become friends with these people, in particular Moon-Face and Silky. At the very top of the tree they discover a ladder which leads them to a magical land. This land is different on each visit, because each place moves on from the top of the tree to make way for a new land. The children are free to come and go, but they must leave before the land moves on or they will be stuck there until the land returns to the Faraway Tree. In various chapters, one of the children gets stuck in the land.\n\nThe lands at the top are sometimes extremely unpleasant – for example the Land of Dame Slap, an aggressive school teacher; and sometimes fantastically enjoyable – notably the Land of Birthdays, the Land of Goodies, the Land of Take-What-You-Want and the Land of Do-As-You-Please.\n\nThe first land the three children visit is the Roundabout Land, where they give some cake to two rabbits, and the rabbits dig a hole for themselves and the three children. The last land they visit in this book is the Land of Birthdays, where the brownies and the inhabitants of the Faraway Tree celebrate Bessie's birthday.\n\nThis land spins round and round like a roundabout, and plays music as it spins. In the land live a number of rabbits and an old man who sings along with the music while tapping his hand to the beat. The land only stops spinning once in a blue moon.\n\nThe land is full of ice and snow. It has a moon and a sun in the sky at the same time. In the land live the polar bears, and the Magic Snowman used to live there before Moon-Face melted him.\n\nThe Saucepan Man used to live there before he went to live in the Faraway Tree. The island is surrounded by mist and has a set of saucepans as steps, leading down to the Saucepan Man’s home.\n\nIs a land where you cannot take one step forward without taking ten steps back. Hills in the land go up and down and sometimes the land will tip completely sideways and you have to grab hold of a tree or roll off. It is believed that it is held by a giant who is trying to throw the land off his back.\n\nIs a land in which, as the name suggests, you can take whatever you want for free.\n\nIs the land where Dame Slap has her school for naughty brownies, pixies and fairies, and results with very horrid punishments (e.g. go to bed without supper, slaps, etc.). This was later changed into Dame Snap, who shouts instead of slaps, to reduce the image of violence.\n\nIs a land full of seagulls.\n\nThe Red Goblins used to live in the land before Wizard Mighty-One took them prisoner in the Land of Wizards.\n\nIs home to several wizards and Wizard Mighty-One and the prisoner Red Goblins.\n\nIs a land you can visit only if someone has a birthday. It is land which provides party food and games for you if you have a birthday party. Bessie's one birthday is celebrated there.\n"}

The story centers on a group of young adults who become stranded on a deserted island, where they are stalked and murdered by a monstrous assailant.\n\nDuring Labor Day weekend in 1946, young, virginal Ida Parsons innocuously plays as her father hosts a raucous party at his home on Lake Michigan. Amid the festivities, an older, drunken man named Tom Rice staggers outside and propositions Ida. When she refuses, he chases her into the woods and brutally rapes her; her dogs break out of their pen and they attack and fatally maul Ida's rapist.\n\nThirty-six years later in 1982, Waspy brothers Eric and Nick are borrowing their father's yacht to take their girlfriends, Sandy and Donna, on a weekend outing along with their sister, Carla to St. Martin Island. At the outset of the trip. As the tensions rise between Nick and Eric, Donna and Sandy engage in girl-talk, and geeky Carla silently laments that she is the sole member of the cruise who came along without a significant other.\n\nThat night, fog settles in; Eric and Nick, hearing cries out on the water, discover and rescue a shipwrecked fisherman named Bert. Bert informs them that he wrecked offshore Dog Island, the home of lumber baroness Ida Parsons, who has used her family fortune to hole herself up on the island for the past thirty-five years; only making two annual voyages onto the mainland for necessary supplies, and never speaking to anyone during these trips. Recovering from the onset of hypothermia, Bert tells the quintet a campfire story about the savagery of the wild dogs which roam Ida's island, acting as her sentries. Wrecking their boat after Nick, in a panic, attempts to steer the boat back to the mainland.\n\nDonna, Eric, Sandy, Nick, and Bert wash up on so-called \"Dog Island;\" Bert has been seriously wounded, and Carla is nowhere to be found. Nick wanders off into the woods, and is subsequently killed by a hulking figure that breaks down the shed where Nick hides. The next morning, Sandy and Eric go off onto the island, hoping that Ida Parsons will help them get back to the mainland. Shortly after they leave the beach, Bert goes into shock, and Donna desperately tries to warm him. Seconds later, the same figure which killed Nick sneaks up behind Donna and Bert, fatally hurling Donna against a rock wall and decapitating Bert.\n\nAt the center of the island, Sandy and Eric discover Ida's fortified cabin, as well as the fact that all of Ida's dogs have died long ago, their mutilated skeletons lying in their pens. In Ida's boathouse, the duo discover Carla alive hiding under a tarp; she apparently washed up at another point on the beach and made it to the compound in the middle of the night.\n\nIn the course of exploring Ida's compound, Eric, Sandy and Carla discover a dust-covered nursery full of antique toys, and a cobweb-covered crib; they also discover Ida Parson's diary, which contains insane, rambling passages about giving birth to a sick child, which she intends to keep sinless by secluding him from all the evils of the outside world. As they continue exploring the house, Sandy comes across Ida's skeletal corpse in repose in her bedroom. The group decides to collect supplies and head back to the shore to collect the rest of their party so they can formulate an escape from the island in Ida's old rowboat. While exploring the basement, they discover the corpses of Nick and Donna and flee to the beach in a panic.\n\nEric and Sandy deduce that Ida Parson's 35-year-old mutant son was the one behind the murders, left insane by his life of solitude under the care of the imbalanced Ida; with nothing to do but learn from Ida and explore the wilderness, he's become immensely strong, a capable tracker and hunter, and is thoroughly convinced that all outsiders are a threat to him and his mother. With the death of Ida, he was left without any basis for reality, and ended up eating the dogs to survive.\n\nEric and Sandy go back to the house and get the matches that Sandy dropped earlier. Ida's son attacks, breaking down the door. Eric attempts to fight using a broken branch, but the mutant grapples with him and fatally breaks Eric's back; and chases Sandy upstairs into his mother's bedroom, where she wraps a blanket around her head and, playing Ida, convinces the mutant to leave his mother's bedroom. When Sandy leaves, the mutant pursues her to the boathouse, where she runs headlong into Carla. The mutant grabs Carla and crushes her face and kills her. Sandy manages to lure the man into Ida's boathouse, which she sets on fire; although severely burned in the blaze, he still manages to attack Sandy, chasing her up a hill where she yanks a sharp signpost from the ground and impales him. As he dies, his burned, deformed face is finally seen.\n\nTraumatized by the death of her friends and the killing she has been forced to commit, Sandy sits alone on Ida's dock, strongly resembling a scarred and traumatized Ida.\n\n\n\"Humongous\" received mostly negative reviews upon its initial release. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half out of a possible four stars, calling the film \"slow-moving\", and criticizing the film's overuse of cliches, lack of visibility, and lack of clear shots of the monster. AllMovie's review of the film was negative, calling it a \"plodding horror bore\" and commenting, \"whatever interest this deathly dull flick may have mustered is completely obscured by some of the murkiest cinematography on record; the fact that nearly every scene is shrouded in complete darkness may prove a blessing in disguise.\" Tim Brayton from \"Antagony & Ecstasy\" gave the film a negative review calling the film \"Junk\" and criticized the film's characterization as being \"of limited interest\" but complimented the film's unique villain and being better acted than most slasher films. Justin Kerswell from \"Hysteria Lives!\" awarded the film 2.5/5 stars, writing, \"HUMONGOUS seems to desperately want to be a hefty helping of true American Gothic, but in reality it's far too cheesy to be very macabre or even generate many true thrills.\"\n\nOver the years, contemporary reviews have been more positive of the film. For the film's 35th Anniversary, Dave J. Wilson from \"Dread Central\" wrote a retrospective on the film, noting its similarities with Joe D'Amato's 1980 film \"Antropophagus\", which Wilson felt \"undeservedly achieved cult status\". In his retrospective, Wilson stated that, while the film was no classic, it didn't deserve the obscurity and abysmal reviews that it was given. Wilson concluded his assessment by writing, \"Under-seen and unfairly maligned, there is not much to dislike about \"Humongous\"... aside from Nick and Donna. Atmospheric, brutal, sleazy, suspenseful and tense, a monstrous villain, and an energetic finale, this is an entertaining little slasher flick.\"\n\nTodd Martin from \"HorrorNews.net\" called the film \"great little flick that has gone somewhat unnoticed for way too long\". In his review, Martin commended the film's premise, death scenes, soundtrack, and suspense; while criticizing the poor lighting of some scenes. Kurt Dahlke from DVD Talk wrote in his review of the film, \"Though derivative of other Slasher Movies, plagued by the annoying improbabilities of all A-to-B horror efforts, filled with bickering dorks, and pretty slow to get started, \"Humongous\" eventually gets to a weird, frenetic payoff\". Tom Becker from DVD Verdict also gave the film a positive review. In his review on the film Becker commented, \"While it might not be the shocker it should be, \"Humongous\" is a pretty entertaining bit of horror fluff from the days when people took this stuff seriously\". Jack Sommersby from \"eFilmCritic.com\" awarded the film a score of 3/4 stating, \"It's perfect for audiences looking for an undemanding, scary good time, along with those longing to see the drop-dead gorgeous Janet Julian in a skimpy bikini\".\n\nAlthough, reception from critics have remained negative. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 0% based on six reviews.\n\n\"Humongous\" made its debut on DVD on Nov 15, 2011 where it was released by Scorpion Releasing. It has also been released on Blu-ray by Scorpion Releasing.\n\n"}

Jan Ullrich's victory margin, of 9:09 was the largest margin of victory since Laurent Fignon won the 1984 Tour de France by 10:32. Since 1997 no rider has had this convincing of a win with the closest margin to Ullrich's victory being Vincenzo Nibali winning the 2014 Tour de France with a gap of 7:39. Ullrich's simultaneous victories in both the general classification and the young riders' classification marked the first time the same rider had won both categories in the same Tour since Laurent Fignon in 1983. The points classification was won by Ullrich's teammate Erik Zabel, for the second time, and their team also won the team classification. The mountains classification was won by Richard Virenque for the fourth time.\n\n198 riders in 22 teams commenced the 1997 Tour de France. 139 riders finished. The 16 teams with the highest UCI ranking at the start of 1997 were automatically qualified. Six wildcard invitations were also given.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\n\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Port d'Envalira mountain pass on stages 10 and 11.\n\nThe Prologue was won by Time Trial Specialist Chris Boardman giving him the Yellow Jersey for stage one with Ullrich just two seconds behind. Defending champion Bjarne Riis, who had been preparing for and seeking a repeat victory with Ullrich acting as his Super-Domestique finished outside the top 10 but was in no way concerned as he had come into the Tour in good form. The first four stages were flat stages, the first two of which were won by the infamous Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini with the third going to Erik Zabel and the fourth being won by Nicola Minali. Cipollini would wear the Yellow Jersey following the first few stages due to bonus seconds during the sprint finishes. During the 261 km stage five from Chantonnay to Le Chatre Cédric Vasseur survived a breakaway and finished nearly two and a half minutes ahead of the Peloton to claim the stage win and the Yellow Jersey, which he would hold on to until the race reached the high mountains.\n\nStage 6 was won by Jeroen Blijlevens in a sprint finish with Djamolidine Abdoujaparov finishing 2nd which would be his highest placing in this final TDF of his impressive career. Stages 7 and 8 followed rounding out the first week with sprint finishes, both of which were won by Erik Zabel as he bested Jaan Kirsipuu and Blijlevens in stage 7 and Minali and Blijlevens in stage 8. Zabel had donned the Green Jersey following stage 3 and would hold it all the way to Paris. Stage 9 was the first stage in the Pyrenees which included the Col d’Aspin and Col du Tourmalet as two of the five categorized climbs. Laurent Brochard won the stage with the elite group of Richard Virenque, Pantani and Ullrich finishing 0:14 behind. Surprisingly to some defending champion Riis lost nearly thirty seconds to the other contenders coming across in 8th putting him in a tie for 4th in the overall standings with Virenque at 1:43 behind Vasseur after the first major mountain stage. Spaniard Abraham Olano was in 3rd at 1:14 behind and the next closest GC favorite was Ullrich 0:14 behind him.\n\nStage 10 was another high mountain stage with five climbs and was won convincingly by Ullrich by 1:06 over Virenque and Pantani as Riis and Olano each lost more than three minutes. With the victory Ullrich became the first German rider to wear the Maillot Jaune since Klaus-Peter Thaler in the 1978 Tour de France and only 3rd overall as \"Didi\" Dietrich Thurau wore it for 15 days in the 1977 Tour de France. Stage 11 was an intermediate stage in which Laurent Desbiens survived to finish 0:18 ahead of the bunch together with two other riders whom he outsprinted to take the stage win. There were no major attacks by the GC riders in this stage so going into the ITT in Stage 12 Ullrich was convincingly in the lead at 2:38 over Virenque, 4:46 over Alano and 4:53 over his teammate Riis, who at this point remained confident he was still the leader of Team Telekom with Ullrich continuing to ride for him as a Super-Domestique.\n\nThe individual time trial extinguished any and all doubts who was in command of the race as Ullrich put more than three minutes into all of his competitors and teammates with 2nd place Virenque now approaching a six minute deficit in the overall standings and Pantani, Alano and Riis each being eight minutes or more behind.\n\nStage 13 was Alpe d’Huez and the only rider able to drop Ullrich was Pantani who had to put in one of the fastest recorded times up Alp d’Huez in TDF history in order to do so. Virenque finished 3rd 1:27 behind Pantani and Francesco Casagrande finished 4th on the stage while also moving to 6th place in the overall standings. Riis finished 5th, losing nearly another two minutes to Ullrich. In stage 14 Virenque made an attack to win back time on Ullrich, helped by his entire team. The margin was never more than two minutes, and Ullrich was able to get back to Virenque before the final climb. Virenque won the stage, but Ullrich finished in the same time.\nIn stage 15 it was the Pirate attacking and winning his second stage and while he remained more than ten minutes behind Ullrich he did jump Riis in the standings to move in the final podium position.\n\nUllrich remained fully in command as the race progressed and aside from suffering a major crash or failing a doping control there wasn't much chance of him losing the Tour. Stage 18 was the final mountain stage and included a rare climb up the Ballon d'Alsace, which was a popular stage early in TDF history but hadn't been included since the 1982 Tour de France and was added to the route for only the 4th time since World War II. Frenchman Didier Rous would win the stage beating the next closest breakaway riders in Pascal Herve, Bobby Julich and Laurent Roux by more than five minutes to finish the mountain stages with there being no further changes among the general classification favorites.\n\nThe final ITT in Stage 20 was won by Alano with Ullrich taking second 0:45 back. The final stage on the Champs Elysees was won by Nicola Minali who beat out Zabel, Blijlevens, Henk Vogel, Robbie McEwen and George Hincapie in the mass sprint finish. Afterwards on the podiums Erik Zabel was awarded the green jersey, Richard Virenque won the King of the Mountains as well as the Most Combative Rider, in 3rd place on the podium was Marco Pantani, in 2nd was Virenque and in 1st overall winning the best young rider award, as well as the yellow jersey as champion of the Tour de France was Jan Ullrich.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1997 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Richard Virenque won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Port d'Envalira on stage 10. This prize was won by Virenque for the third time, the most by any rider in Tour history.\n\n\nAfter Ullrich's domination of the 1997 Tour de France at his young age, it was believed that Ullrich would dominate the Tour de France for the next years. However, Ullrich would never win the Tour again, although he did reach the podium four more times finishing second to Pantani in 1998 and standing 2nd on the podium to Lance Armstrong three times. He also reached the podium in the 2005 Tour de France, but that result was later voided. Ullrich would win another Grand Tour however, the 1999 Vuelta a Espana.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2276540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276540", "title": "Illegal agreement", "text": "Illegal agreement\n\nAn illegal agreement under the common law of contract, is one that the court will not enforce because the purpose of the agreement is to achieve an illegal end. The illegal end must result from performance of the contract itself. The classic example of such an agreement is a contract for murder.\n\nThe illegality of a contract depends on (1) the law of the country governing the contract, and (2) the law of the place of performance. Different rules will apply depending on the law of the relevant country(ies).\n\nHowever, a contract that requires only legal performance on the part of each party, such as the sale of packs of cards to a known gambler, where gambling is illegal, will nonetheless be enforceable. A contract directly linked to the gambling act itself, such as paying off gambling debts (see proximate cause), however, will not meet the legal standards of enforceability. Therefore, an employment contract between a blackjack dealer and a speakeasy manager, is an example of an illegal agreement and the employee has no valid claim to his anticipated wages if gambling is illegal under that jurisdiction.\n\nIn \"Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises\" (1988), the California Court of Appeal for the Third District refused to enforce a contract for payment of promissory notes used for the purchase of a company that manufactured drug paraphernalia. Although the items sold were not actually illegal, the court refused to enforce the contract for public policy concerns.\n\nIn Canada, one cited case of lack of enforceability based on illegality is \"Royal Bank of Canada v. Newell, 147 D.L.R (4th) 268 (N.S.C.A.),\" in which a woman forged her husband's signature on 40 cheques, totalling over $58,000. To protect her from prosecution, her husband signed a letter of intent prepared by the bank in which he agreed to assume \"all liability and responsibility\" for the forged cheques. However, the agreement was unenforceable, and was struck down by the courts, because of its essential goal, which was to \"stifle a criminal prosecution\". Because of the contract's illegality, and as a result voided status, the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.\n\nContracts in restraint of trade are a variety of illegal contracts and generally will not be enforced unless they are reasonable in the interests of the contracting parties and the \npublic.\n\nContracts in restraint of trade if proved to be reasonable can be enforced. When restraint is placed on an ex-employee, the court will consider the geographical limits, what the employee knows and the extent of the duration. Restraint imposed on a vendor of business must be reasonable and is binding if there is a genuine seal of goodwill. Under common law, contracts to fix prices are legal. \"Sole supplier\" (\"solus\") agreements are legal if reasonable. Contracts which contravene public policy are void.\n\n"}

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case decided on June 12, 1992, in which the court held that a group of American wildlife conservation and other environmental organizations lacked standing to challenge regulations jointly issued by the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, regarding the geographic area to which a particular section of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied. The case arose over issues of US funding of development projects in Aswan, Egypt and Mahaweli, Sri Lanka that could harm endangered species in the affected areas. The government declared that the act did not apply to projects outside of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife sued.\n\nSaid Lily Henning of the \"Legal Times\":\n\nWriting for the plurality, Justice Scalia stated that Defenders had failed to satisfy Constitutional requirements for “injury in fact” that would grant standing under the Endangered Species Act. He wrote that the Court rejected the view that the citizen suit provision of the statute conferred upon “all persons an abstract, self-contained, non-instrumental ‘right’ to have the Executive observe the procedures required by law.\" Rather, he explained, an American citizen plaintiff must have suffered a tangible and particular harm.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy and Justice David Souter asserted in their concurring opinion that an airline ticket to the affected geographic areas with endangered species in question would have been enough to satisfy the imminent threat of future injury requirement.\n\n\n"}

They were identified as being too closely linked to the opposition JLP and were singled out as being prime targets for assassination by members of the leading Peoples National Party (then headed by the now deceased Michael Manley). The Military Intelligence Unit (M.I.U) was required by government members to take \"all reasonable steps\" to ensure removal either overtly or covertly of anyone who was deemed to be a threat to the island's security and to the smooth running of the PNP government.\n\nThe operation was executed by undercover agents of the Military Intelligence Unit going into the Southside Community and infiltrating the Southside's' \"POW Posse\" which was a local gang operating in the area led by the now assassinated Franklyn Allen aka \"Chubby Dread\". There were fourteen men in this gang who were originally targeted for assassination. The men were promised jobs as drivers and bodyguards. \n\nThe men, needing the arms and funding, agreed; and in the early hours of 5 January 1978 an army ambulance driven by an MIU operative and a minivan picked them up at the intersection of Higholborn Street and Port Royal Street, then headed west towards Port Henderson, Saint Catherine where the Green Bay artillery range is located. On arrival at the Military Base, the men were led out to a section of the range where they were given strict instructions not to move as they would be picked up by other persons who would take care of their work requirements and supply them with arms to be transported into Kingston..\n\nAs soon as the MIU operatives drove off, a specially selected team of snipers from the JDF, led by Major Ian Robinson was lying in ambush in the nearby hills. The soldiers were armed with L8 General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG), L2A2 Self Loading Rifles and Sterling Sub-Machine Guns with Browning 9mm pistols as sidearms. On the receipt of a pre-arranged signal from one of the MIU operatives which was the firing of a single shot from his Browning 9mm pistol into the upper torso of Winston Hamilton aka \"Saddle Head\", the sniper team opened fire on the group of men from their nest in the hills. Five men fell dead under the hail of gunfire that erupted and the remainder fled into nearby bushes. At least one member, (Delroy Griffiths) entered the bay and was rescued by a passing fishing boat.\n\nThose killed were all Labourites from South Side: \n\nThe official report released by the Military was that the men were shot dead after they were surprised by a special Strike Force of soldiers doing target practice with guns smuggled into the country on the Jamaica Defence Force artillery firing range at Green Bay. \n\nThis report did not stick, as the people of South Side demonstrated to protest against the killings. An official inquiry and Coroners' Inquest was later held in the Spanish Town Coroner's Court where a jury found that persons had conspired to kill the men at Green Bay and that people in the JDF were criminally responsible for the massacre. The overwhelming evidence was that the men were lured to Green Bay and ambushed by soldiers led by Major Ian Robinson and Captain Karl Marsh. \n\nIn July 1978 warrants were issued by the Supreme Court for ten members of the JDF for First Degree Capital Murder and Conspiracy to Commit Murder. These included Major Ian Robinson, Captain Karl Marsh, Lieutenants Suzanne Haik, and Frederick Frazer, Sergeant LaFlamme Schooler, Privates Desmond Grant, Errol Grant, Everald King, Colin Reid and Joel Stainrod. Those charged for the conspiracy were all acquitted in June and July 1981 on no case submissions and those charged for the actual murders were acquitted on February 8, 1982 due to insufficient evidence. \n\nThe Jamaica Labour Party refused the verdict but could do nothing to bring the perpetrators to justice as they were already acquitted by the Courts. The Michael Manley led PNP has always disavowed knowledge of the covert action that took the lives of the men and said it was purely a military operation that was later justified. The incident is considered one of the worst acts of brutality in Jamaican history.\n"}

In the United States, such a building may also be called a student union, student commons, or union. The term \"student union\" refers most often in the United States to a building, while in other nations a \"students' union\" is the student government. Nevertheless, the Association of College Unions International (largely US-based) has several hundred campus organizational members in the US; there is no sharp dichotomy in interpretation of \"union\" in this context. The US usage in reference to a location is simply a shortened form of student union building.\n\nThe first student union in America was Houston Hall, at the University of Pennsylvania, which opened January 2, 1896 and remains in operation to this day. The first Ohio Union at Ohio State University was Enarson Hall. The building opened in 1911 and was the first student union to be built at a state university and the fourth of its kind in the United States. Oklahoma State University's student union opened in 1950. Subsequent additions, and renovations in 2010, have made the building one of the largest student activity centers in the world at .\n\nSome student centers carry unique origins and historical significance with some on the National Register of Historic Places. The William Pitt Union was originally constructed in 1898 as a hotel and was converted into a student center in 1956. Some student activity centers on the NRHP include O'Hara Student Center (University of Pittsburgh), McKenny Hall (Eastern Michigan University), and the Tivoli Student Union. The Tivoli Student Union was originally home to the Trevoli Brewing Company but since has been converted to serve several institutions in Denver, Colorado.\n\nIn 2007, the University of Vermont's student center became the first LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\nOther examples of student centers include West Virginia University's Mountainlair, the J. Wayne Reitz Union at the University of Florida, the Bronco Student Center at Cal Poly Pomona, the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and the Price Center at UC San Diego.\n\nBroadly speaking, the facility is devoted to student recreation and socialization. A student center or student union is the community center of the college, serving students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests. A student activity center might offer a variety of programs, activities, services, and facilities.\n\nIt may contain lounges, wellness centers, dining facilities or vendors, and entertainment venues. The student center is often the center of student affairs and activities and may house the offices of the student government or other student groups. It may also act as a small conference center, with its meeting rooms rented out to student groups and local organizations holding conferences or competitions. An example of this for instance is the Michigan Union, which hosts the University of Michigan Model United Nations conference.\n\nDepending on the school and its location it might have unique amenities such as a bowling alley, cultural or prayer rooms and unique services. At Eastern Michigan University Student Center the building offers a kiva, a round, 360-degree room patterned after spaces used in Native American cultures. The Kiva Room at EMU is used as a meeting space, for collaboration, or for musical purposes. In the Ohio State University-Ohio Union, the student union offers an interfaith prayer room which has feet washing area for Muslim students. The University of Central Florida has an eyewear and optometric consumer service location.\n\n"}
{"id": "2276568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276568", "title": "Curtis Howe Springer", "text": "Curtis Howe Springer\n\nCurtis Howe Springer (December 2, 1896 – August 19, 1985) was an American radio evangelist, self-proclaimed medical doctor and Methodist minister best known for founding the Zzyzx Mineral Springs resort located within Southern California's Mojave Desert. He was also the host of well-known evangelical syndicated radio programs that were broadcast throughout the United States for several decades.\n\nSpringer was in actuality neither a doctor nor a minister, and he described himself as the \"last of the old-time medicine men.\" In 1969, the American Medical Association labeled him the \"King of Quacks\". In the early 1970s, the federal government discovered that Springer held no legal rights to the land where Zzyzx stood; consequently, he was evicted from the space and briefly imprisoned.\n\nCurtis Howe Springer was born December 2, 1896, and hailed from Wheeling, West Virginia. He was married to Mary Louise Berkebile. They separated at some point, and he married a woman named Helen. Springer had several children, including a daughter, Marilou, and a son, Curtis Jr., who later became a judge in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nHe claimed to have been a private in the United States Army, where he taught boxing. In Springer's early life, he \"drummed up crowds for William Jennings Bryan's tirades against demon rum\" and was a sheet music vendor at Billy Sunday's evangelical services. Following World War I, Springer worked at a school in Florida. In the late 1920s, Springer moved to Chicago, where he became involved with an automotive technical school called Greer College. Springer was fired by 1930, and the school was forced into bankruptcy shortly afterward.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Curtis Springer gave lectures throughout the midwestern United States, claiming to either to be the \"Dean of Greer College\", or that he represented/attended the fictional institutions of the National Academy, The Springer School of Humanism, the American College of Doctors and Surgeons, the Westlake West Virginia College, and two non-existent osteopathy schools in Meyersdale, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Although all his lectures were \"free\", Springer would ask for donations part-way through his speech, and often attempt to sell audience members private courses in psychoanalysis for $25 per session. In advertisements for his appearances, he would often follow his name with M.D., N.D., D.O. or Ph.D.\n\nChicago was largely Springer's home base until the summer of 1934. After he applied for airtime on WGN radio, the station contacted American Medical Association's Bureau of Investigations for information regarding Springer. The AMA and Better Business Bureau quickly began to take note of his completely falsified education record. Before long, Springer had been labeled as a notorious fraud and doctor-impersonator by the medical community. An extensive article in the September 14, 1936 edition of \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" titled \"Curtis Howe Springer: A Quack and His Nostrums\" detailed his exploits and lack of education. The book concluded that \"a most thorough search fails to show that Springer was ever graduated by any reputable college or university, medical or otherwise.\"\n\nAlthough denied airtime on WGN, he was successful in obtaining a twice-daily slot as a radio evangelist on Chicago's WCFL. He began broadcasting on the station in 1934. His programs were often an outlet for his support of Franklin Roosevelt and The New Deal. In addition, he would often use the radio show to sell his \"medicines\", including the antacid Re-Hib (confirmed by the American Medical Association to be mostly baking soda) and Antediluvian Tea (\"a crude mixture of laxative herbs\").\n\nAround 1935, Springer left Chicago and began preaching on KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nSpringer's wife Mary encouraged him to try to launch a health spa and in 1931, he launched a resort called Haven of Rest in Fort Hill, Pennsylvania. Only six years after it first opened, he lost Haven of Rest due to non-payment of taxes. He attempted to set up other resorts and gatherings in Wilkes-Barre, Johnstown, and Mount Davis in Pennsylvania; Cumberland, Maryland; and Davenport, Iowa.\nIn 1944, Springer and his new fiancée Helen filed a mining claim on federal land to 12,800 acres (51.8 km²) in California's Mojave Desert, claiming a tract about 8 miles (13 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide. The land contained the remains of an 1860 Army post and a railroad station on the defunct Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad. He named the settlement Zzyzx as a gimmick to ensure that it would be \"the last word\" in health. Zzyzx's original encampment consisted of 20 tents, and he recruited homeless men from Los Angeles' Skid Row to build simple concrete buildings. Springer created an imitation hot springs – which he attempted to pass off as genuine – by using a boiler to heat several pools. In time, Springer erected a sixty-room hotel, a church, a cross-shaped health spa with mineral baths, a radio broadcast studio, a private airstrip dubbed \"Zyport\" and several other buildings which included a castle. The \"Boulevard of Dreams\" was a divided parkway leading to an oasis on Lake Tuendae, later identified as the habitat of the endangered Mohave chub. While building his retreat, he spent half the week in Los Angeles, still recording his radio program, and rounding up workers to build his new resort by offering room and board at Zzyzx in exchange for labor.\n\nFrom Zzyzx, Springer continued his syndicated radio program, at one point carried by 221 stations in the United States and 102 more abroad, mixing religious music and his own radio evangelism. Along with this came his requests that listeners send him \"donations\" to get his special cures for everything from hair loss to cancer. The potions were actually little more than a blend of celery, carrot and parsley juices. The Zzyzx Springs experience itself included goat milk; allegedly life-prolonging \"Antedeluvian Tea\"; a $25, self-administered hemorrhoid cure; more solicitations for \"donations\"; and a twice-daily sermon over the loudspeakers.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Springer had begun marking off lots on the land and allowing \"donors\" of large sums of money to his ministry to build homes on the lots. This caught the attention of federal officials. While Springer had posted mining claims in the area, under the General Mining Law of 1872, it was still public land until such time that he validated the claims for patent by proving to federal government geologists that the claim contained minerals that could be extracted at a profit.\n\nThe federal government took Springer to court claiming he was squatting on federal land. In 1974, he was found guilty of the charge. He offered to pay $34,187 in back rent on the land to the Bureau of Land Management, but the government refused the payment and evicted him and his few hundred local followers. Springer was also convicted for making false claims that the health foods he sold would cure everything \"from sore toes to cancer.\" He was represented in court by criminal attorney Gladys Towles Root. In the trial, Springer was convicted of false advertising. He filed several appeals on this conviction, and two years later ended up serving 49 days of a 60-day sentence.\n\nFollowing the eviction, in 1976, the Bureau of Land Management allowed the California State University to manage the facilities and land in and around Zzyzx. A consortium of colleges combined funds and resources to convert the former resort into a research station called the Desert Studies Center; schools contributing to the center included California State Universities at Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pomona and Northridge. After his release from prison, Springer and his wife relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he spent the remainder of his life.\n\nCurtis Springer died in Las Vegas on August 19, 1985, at the age of 88. He was buried in the Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Two publications, the journal \"\" and the book \"Weird California\", have incorrectly reported Springer's year of death as 1986.\n\n"}
