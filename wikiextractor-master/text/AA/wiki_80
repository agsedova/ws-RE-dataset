The arena was proposed to be built in time to host the 2003 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, but due to unforeseen complications with the investors, the ice hockey governing body had to switch that tournament to Finland. The arena's main backer then became Sazka a.s., a Czech betting company.\n\nThe construction of the arena (which began in September 2002) was not without problems, but it was finally finished in time to host the 2004 tournament, the 2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.\n\nIn March 2008, the building was renamed O2 Arena.\n\nIn March 2011, Sazka filed for insolvency due to debts from building the arena.\nFrom its opening until 2015, it was home to HC Slavia Prague of the Czech Extraliga. Slavia won the national championship on home ice in Game 7 of the 2008 Extraliga finals against HC Karlovy Vary 4-0 in front of a then-league-record crowd of 17,117. In 2015, Slavia was relegated to the 1.liga, and the club chose to move back to the smaller Zimní stadion Eden, the team's former home and current training centre. In its place, O2 Arena reached an agreement with cross-town rivals Sparta Prague on 24 June 2015. Sparta ownership cited the need for significant renovations at Tipsport Arena as the main reason for the move.\n\nFor two seasons, 2012–13 and 2013–14, O2 Arena also hosted occasional home games of HC Lev Prague of the Kontinental Hockey League. The club played its home games of the 2014 Gagarin Cup Finals at O2 Arena, attracting the three largest crowds in league history.\n\nIn 2015, O2 Arena co-hosted the IIHF World Championship with ČEZ Aréna in Ostrava for the second time. This time, the tournament re-established the record for World Championship attendance.\n\nIn 2017, it hosted the 1st edition of Laver Cup international indoor hard court men's tennis tournament between Europe and Team World.\n\nIn 2021, the venue will host some group phase matches at the FIBA EuroBasket 2021 which the country will play host alongside Georgia in Tbilisi, Germany in Berlin/Cologne and Italy in Milan.\n\n\n\n"}

It is considered \"the most conservative Iranian newspaper.\"\nHossein Shariatmadari is the editor-in-chief of \"Kayhan\". His official position is representative of the Supreme Leader.\n\n\"Kayhan\" has about 1,000 employees worldwide. There are conflicting reports about its circulation numbers: in 2006 the BBC gave \"60-100,000\", in 2007 the \"New York Times\" gave \"about 70,000\", and in 2008 a New York University School of Law journal article gave \"350,000\". Kayhan also publishes special foreign editions, which include the English-language \"Kayhan International\". \n\n\"Kayhan\" was founded in February 1943 by owner Abdul-Rahman Faramarzi and Mostafa Mesbahzadeh as editor-in-chief. Later the roles of Faramarzi and Mesbahzadeh were reversed. Published in Iran as well as in London, the newspaper had a circulation greater than one-million prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Shah all of Mesbahzadeh's assets were seized, including the publishing plant, which was the main headquarters of the daily. In May 1980, Ayatollah Khomeini named Ebrahim Yazdi, then foreign minister, as head of the daily. Under the guidance of Mesbahzadeh, the London office of \"Kayhan\" continued its work and publishes a monarchist weekly issue known as \"Kayhan London\", which has a small circulation. In 2006, Mesbahzadeh died at the age of 98 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe paper focuses on political, cultural, social and economic news.\n\n\"Kayhan\" supports the Iranian government and the policies of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Shariatmadari stated that the newspaper and its staff \"defend the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.\" Gareth Smyth, the former Iran correspondent of the \"Financial Times\", contends that \"Kayhan\" articulates the political views of the \"regime's fundamentalist camp.\" \"The New York Times\" correspondent Michael Slackman writes that the newspaper \"offers insight into the most extreme views of Iran’s leaders and into the mind-set and plans of those who are at the center of power.\" A former editor of \"Kayhan\", Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin, a \"reformist\" and a staunch anti government activist, states, \"The truth is, \"Kayhan\" is an intelligence newspaper.\"\n\nShariatmadari rejects the labels \"conservative\" and \"fundamentalist\", saying \"They make us sound like the Taliban.\" Instead, he calls himself and those with similar views \"principalists.\" Principalists is also the name of the majority faction of the Iranian Parliament. This group is also referred to as \"neo-principalists\" and includes such figures as Gholamali Haddad Adel and Saeed Jalili among the others. In fact, the daily is the print media outlet of the group.\n\nThe newspaper became controversial in 2010 for iterating an unequivocal condemnation of then French First Lady Carla Bruni for her open letter about the death sentence against Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani for adultery and alleged murder; the newspaper called Bruni an \"Italian prostitute\" and \"the singer and decadent actress who managed to break [up] the Sarkozy family\" who \"deserves to die\" for her \"perverted lifestyle\", reiterating the striking similarities between Ashtiani and Carla Bruni, and also condemned actress Isabelle Adjani as a prostitute. The French foreign ministry condemned the comments as \"unacceptable\" and summoned the Iranian ambassador to France; the Iranian foreign ministry sought to distance itself from \"Kayhan\"'s comments, with spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast stating that \"The media can properly criticize the wrong and hostile policies of other countries by refraining from using insulting words. This is not correct.\"\n\nIn 2020, following its expulsion from Iran, Kayhan's editor, Hossein Shariatmadari, described Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) as an \"American puppet\" because it is \"based in France and all anti-Iranian groups have a base in France.\"\n"}

He was chosen to succeed Robert, and as soon as he was elected, he accompanied Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade, and was among those sent ahead to Constantinople before Louis' arrival there. He later saved Louis during a battle with the Seljuk Turks in Pisidia.\n\nAccording to the chronicler Odo of Deuil, Everard was extremely pious and valiant. He seems to have had a strong influence on Louis. After the failure of the crusade at the Siege of Damascus in 1148, Louis returned to France, followed by Everard, who was in charge of the king's treasury. Everard's Templars stayed behind and helped defend Jerusalem against a Turkish raid in 1149.\n\nBack in France, Everard abdicated officially in 1151 and became a monk at Clairvaux, despite the protests of the Templars.

Only once did he really came close to stardom, as Clay Morgan, one of the leads in the CBS television series \"Tales of the Texas Rangers\", which aired fifty-two episodes from 1955 to 1958.

It guards the entrance to the Ceiriog Valley. It was the administrative centre for the Marcher Lordship of Chirkland.\n\nThe castle was bought by Sir Thomas Myddelton in 1593 for £5,000 (approx. £11 million ). His son, Thomas Myddelton of Chirk Castle was a Parliamentarian during the English Civil War, but became a Royalist during the 'Cheshire rising' of 1659 led by George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer. Following the Restoration, his son became Sir Thomas Myddelton, 1st Baronet of Chirke. The castle passed down in the Myddelton family to Charlotte Myddelton (on the death of her father in 1796).

From his elder brother, Paul Scott Mowrer, the editor of \"Chicago Daily News\", Mowrer received a job and in 1914 went to France as a foreign correspondent. From there he reported on events throughout the First World War, including the Italians' defeat at the Battle of Caporetto. In 1916, he married Lilian Thomson; the two had a daughter, Diana, and would remain together until Mowrer's death 61 years later.\n\nMowrer remained a correspondent in Europe throughout the 1920s and 1930s, living in Rome for eight years until 1923, before moving to Berlin. In 1933, Mowrer won the Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence for his reporting on the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, and was named president of the Foreign Press Association. In his dispatches from Germany he had managed to cut below the patina of normalcy to capture events that challenged the belief that Germany's transformation was democratic and natural; he was therefore a target of Nazi ire. In addition to reporting for the \"Chicago Daily News\", Mowrer wrote a best-selling book, \"Germany Puts the Clock Back,\" published in 1933, which had angered Nazi officials to the point where Mowrer's friends believed he faced mortal danger.\n\nThe German government openly pressured him to leave the country, with Germany's ambassador to the United States notifying the State Department that because of the \"people's righteous indignation\" the government could no longer hope to keep Mowrer free from harm. When the \"Chicago Daily News\" learned about the threats, Frank Knox, the owner of the newspaper, offered Mowrer a position in the paper’s bureau in Tokyo. Mowrer, who did not want to leave Germany, agreed to leave before covering the annual Nazi Party spectacle in Nuremberg set to begin 1 September 1933. After American diplomatic missions to Germany refused to guarantee his and his family's safety, and after a futile personal appeal to newly appointed US ambassador to Germany William Dodd, Mowrer agreed to depart immediately, in return for the release of , an elderly Jewish correspondent for the Austrian newspaper \"Neue Freie Presse\", who was being held by the Gestapo for high treason.\n\nA Nazi official, assigned to make sure Mowrer actually left Berlin, approached him as he was boarding the train and asked when he was coming back to Germany; Mowrer answered: \"Why, when I can come back with about two million of my countrymen.\" Initially, he became the \"Chicago Daily News\" Tokyo correspondent, then later took over as the Paris bureau chief, continuing to report on European affairs until France's defeat by German forces in 1940.\n\nReturning to the United States, Mowrer served as the Deputy Director, first of the Office of Facts and Figures, then, after the OFF's consolidation, of the Office of War Information, from 1942 until 1943. Upon his departure, he started his column \"Edgar Mowrer on World Affairs,\" which he later supplemented with a column entitled \"What's Your Question on World Affairs?\" After the Second World War, Mowrer wrote a number of books and helped organize the Americans for Democratic Action. In 1956, he took over as editor of \"Western World\" magazine, a position he held for four years. In 1969, he moved to Wonalancet, New Hampshire and wrote a column for \"The Union Leader\" until 1976.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887690", "title": "James H. Cone", "text": "James H. Cone\n\nJames Hal Cone (August 5, 1938 – April 28, 2018) was an American theologian, best known for his advocacy of black theology and black liberation theology. His 1969 book \"Black Theology and Black Power\" provided a new way to comprehensively define the distinctiveness of theology in the black church. His message was that Black Power, defined as black people asserting the humanity that white supremacy denied, was the gospel in America. Jesus came to liberate the oppressed, advocating the same thing as Black Power. He argued that white American churches preached a gospel based on white supremacy, antithetical to the gospel of Jesus. Cone's work was influential from the time of the book's publication, and his work remains influential today. His work has been both used and critiqued inside and outside the African-American theological community. He was the Charles Augustus Briggs Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary until his death.\n\nCone was born on August 5, 1938, in Fordyce, Arkansas, and grew up in the racially segregated town of Bearden, Arkansas. He and his family attended Macedonia African Methodist Episcopal Church. He attended Shorter College (1954–1956), a small AME Church junior college, before receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Philander Smith College in 1958, where he was mentored by James and Alice Boyack. In his 2018 memoir \"Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody\", Cone wrote that they were the first whites he met who respected his humanity. Although he had decided against parish ministry, their advice led him to obtain a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Garrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary in 1961, and Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Northwestern University in 1963 and 1965, respectively. He was shocked to learn that most northern whites would not treat him with respect like the Boyacks. Yet he was excited to learn of unfamiliar theologians, controversies and biblical study methodologies. At the urging of and with support from the white theologian William Hordern at Garrett he applied and gained acceptance into the doctoral program in theology.\n\nHe taught theology and religion at Philander Smith College, Adrian College, and beginning in 1970 at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where he was awarded the distinguished Charles A. Briggs Chair in systematic theology in 1977. In 2018, he was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nCone and his wife, Rose Hampton, married in 1958 and divorced in 1977. They had two sons, Micheal and Charles, and two daughters, Krystal and Robynn. In 1979, Cone married Sondra Gibson, who died in 1983. He died on April 28, 2018.\n\nCone wrote, \"Exodus, prophets and Jesus—these three—defined the meaning of liberation in black theology.\" The hermeneutic, or interpretive lens, for James Cone's theology starts with the experience of African Americans, and the theological questions he brings from his own life. He incorporates the powerful role of the black church in his life, as well as racism experienced by African Americans. For Cone, the theologians he studied in graduate school did not provide meaningful answers to his questions. This disparity became more apparent when he was teaching theology at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Arkansas. Cone writes, \"What could Karl Barth possibly mean for black students who had come from the cotton fields of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, seeking to change the structure of their lives in a society that had defined black as non-being?\"\n\nCone's theology also received significant inspiration from a frustration with the black struggle for civil rights; he felt that black Christians in North America should not follow the \"white Church\", on the grounds that it was a willing part of the system that had oppressed black people. Accordingly, his theology was heavily influenced by Malcolm X and the Black Power movement. Martin Luther King Jr. was also an important influence; Cone describes King as a liberation theologian before the phrase existed. Cone wrote, \"I was on a mission to transform self-loathing Negro Christians into black-loving revolutionary disciples of the Black Christ.\" Nevertheless, \"The black church, despite its failures, gives black people a sense of worth.\"\n\nHis methodology for answering the questions raised by the African-American experience is a return to scripture, and particularly to the liberative elements such as the Exodus-Sinai tradition, prophets and the life and teaching of Jesus. However, scripture is not the only source that shapes his theology. In response to criticism from other black theologians (including his brother, Cecil), Cone began to make greater use of resources native to the African-American Christian community for his theological work, including slave spirituals, the blues, and the writings of prominent African-American thinkers such as David Walker, Henry McNeal Turner, and W. E. B. Du Bois. His theology developed further in response to critiques by black women, leading Cone to consider gender issues more prominently and foster the development of womanist theology, and also in dialogue with Marxist analysis and the sociology of knowledge.\n\nCone's thought, along with Paul Tillich, stresses the idea that theology is not universal, but tied to specific historical contexts; he thus critiques the Western tradition of abstract theologizing by examining \"its\" social context. Cone formulates a theology of liberation from within the context of the black experience of oppression, interpreting the central kernel of the Gospels as Jesus' identification with the poor and oppressed, the resurrection as the ultimate act of liberation.\n\nAs part of his theological analysis, Cone argues for God's own identification with \"blackness\":\n\nDespite his associations with the Black Power movement, however, Cone was not entirely focused on ethnicity: \"Being black in America has little to do with skin color. Being black means that your heart, your soul, your mind, and your body are where the dispossessed are.\"\n\nIn 1977, Cone wrote, with a still more universal vision:\nI think the time has come for black theologians and black church people to move beyond a mere reaction to white racism in America and begin to extend our vision of a new socially constructed humanity in the whole inhabited world ... For humanity is whole, and cannot be isolated into racial and national groups.\n\nIn his 1998 essay \"White Theology Revisited\", however, he retains his earlier strong critique of the white church and white man for ignoring or failing to address the problem of race.\n\nCone credits his parents as being his most important early influences. His father had only a sixth-grade education but filed a lawsuit against the Bearden, Arkansas, school board despite threats on his life. White professors of religion and philosophy, James and Alice Boyack at Philander Smith College aided his belief in his own potential and deepened his interest in theodicy and black suffering. He found a mentor, advisor and influential teacher in Garrett scholar William E. Hordern. Professor Philip Watson motivated him to intensive remedial study of English composition. Classmate Lester B. Scherer was a great help in this. Scherer volunteered to edit manuscripts of Cone's early books while Cone's wife Rose typed them, yet Cone complained that neither understood him. Cone wrote his doctoral thesis on Karl Barth. A 1965 breakfast meeting with Benjamin Mays, president of Morehouse College in Atlanta, convinced him that teaching and scholarship were his true calling. The sociologist C. Eric Lincoln found publishers for his early books (\"Black Theology and Black Power\" and \"A Black Theology of Liberation\") which sought to deconstruct mainstream Protestant theologians such as Barth, Niebuhr and Tillich while seeking to draw on the figures of the black church such as Richard Allen (founder in 1816 of the AME Church), black abolitionists ministers Henry Highland Garnet, Daniel Payne, and Henry McNeil Turner (\"God is a Negro\") and Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, James Baldwin, and other figures of the black power and black arts movement.\n\nWomanist theologians, such as Delores Williams, have critiqued Cone for both male-centered language and for not including the experiences of black women in his sources. Williams, in 1993, acknowledged in a footnote in her book \"Sisters in the Wilderness\", that Cone has modified exclusive language for the reprinting of his works and acknowledged the issues with the previous language. However, she argues that he still does not use the experiences of African-American women in his method, and therefore still needs to deal with the sexism of his work.\n\nOther critiques of Cone's theological positions have focused on the need to rely more heavily on sources reflecting black experience in general, on Cone's lack of emphasis on reconciliation within the context of liberation, and on his ideas of God and theodicy. Charles H. Long and other founding members of the Society for the Study of Black Religion were critics of Cone's work. Long rejected black theology contending that theology was a western invention alien to black experience. Others objected to his endorsement of Black Power, lack of interest in reconciliation and concern with scoring academic points.\n\nAspects of Cone's theology and words for some people have been the subject of controversy in the political context of the 2008 US presidential campaign as Jeremiah Wright, at that time pastor of then-candidate Barack Obama, noted that he had been inspired by Cone's theology.\n\nSome scholars of black theology noted that controversial quotes by Wright may not necessarily represent black theology. Cone responded to these alleged controversial comments by noting that he was generally writing about historic white churches and denominations that did nothing to oppose slavery and segregation rather than any white individual.\n\nHoover Institute fellow Stanley Kurtz, in a political commentary in \"National Review\", wrote:\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Cone taught theology and religion at Philander Smith College and Adrian College. At the urging of his mentor, C. Eric Lincoln, Union Theological Seminary in New York City hired him as assistant professor in 1969. He remained there until his death in 2018 rising to assume an endowed full professorship. Cone made significant contributions to theological education in America. Prior to Cone's arrival in 1969, Union Theological Seminary had not accepted a black student into its doctoral program since its founding in 1836. During his career there, Cone supervised over 40 black doctoral students. These included Dwight Hopkins and some of the founders of womanist theology Delores Williams, Jacquelyn Grant, and Kelly Brown Douglas. He delivered countless lectures at other universities and conferences.\n\n\n\n"}

Singapore does not currently observe daylight saving time.\n\nAs part of the Straits Settlements, Singapore originally adopted the Malayan time, which was in 1941.\n\nFollowing the Japanese occupation, Singapore (known as Syonan-to during this time) adopted the Tokyo Standard Time of on 15 February 1942.\n\nAt the end of World War II and the return of the Straits Settlements to the British, Singapore reverted to its pre-war time zone.\n\nAlthough Singapore does not currently observe daylight saving time in the traditional sense due to its tropical location, a form of daylight saving time, using a 20-minute offset, was introduced on an annual basis by the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements in 1933.\n\nOn 2 July 1920, a bill was intituled as Daylight Saving Ordinance, 1920. It is to introduce a 30-minutes offset or seven and a half hour in advance of Greenwich mean time. The bill was read for the first time on 5 July 1920 but was later abandoned.\n\nIn 1932, Sir Arnold Percy Robinson raised the idea of 20-minute offset after an earlier attempt was abandoned in 1920 which was first proposed by Sir Laurence Guillemard for a 30-minute offset.\nOn 26 September 1932, a bill was intituled as Daylight Saving Ordinance, 1932. The Ordinance was passed at a meeting of the Legislative Council held on 5 December 1932 and approved by Sir Cecil Clementi (Governor) on 15 December 1932.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1935, the Daylight Saving Ordinance, 1932 was extended throughout both years by Gazette Notifications. The 20-minute offset was formally adopted as standard time in Singapore in 1936, and in 1 September 1941 the offset was increased to 30 minutes, the same as the 1920 proposal.\n\nIn 1981, Malaysia decided to standardize the time across its territories to a uniform UTC+08:00. Singapore elected to follow suit, citing business and travel schedules. The change took effect on 1 January 1982, when Singapore moved half an hour forward, on 31 December 1981 at 11:30 pm, creating \"Singapore Standard Time\" (SST). SST is 8 hours ahead of UTC and is synchronized with Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Taipei and Perth.\n\nIn the early days, Singapore used timeball on Fort Canning and Mount Faber for sailors to check with their chronometers by the falling ball at exactly 1 p.m daily. When the second world war came to Singapore, the Public Works Department (PWD) cut the masts down as the masts formed an \"ideal\" markers' for artillery. After the war, the timeball became redundant as most ships now had wireless to give them time signals.\n\nThe Time & Frequency Laboratory of A*STAR's National Metrology Centre (NMC) establishes, maintains and disseminates the national time scale of Singapore, which is the Coordinated Universal Time of Singapore, UTC (SG) and Singapore Standard Time (SST).

{"id": "1887709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887709", "title": "Gibson Explorer", "text": "Gibson Explorer\n\nThe Gibson Explorer is a type of electric guitar that made its debut in 1958. The Explorer offered a radical, \"futuristic\" body design, much like its siblings: the Flying V, which was released the same year, and the Moderne, which was designed in 1957 but not released until 1982. The Explorer was the final development of a prototype design that, years later, Gibson marketed under the name Futura.\n\nThe Explorer's initial run was unsuccessful, and the model was discontinued in 1963. In 1976, Gibson began reissuing the Explorer after competitor Hamer Guitars had success selling similar designs. The Explorer became especially popular among the hard rock and heavy metal musicians of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nGibson produced very few Explorers during the 1958 run of the original korina wood model. Because production records have been lost and shipping records are unclear, it is not known exactly how many were made, but the original run total has been estimated at less than 50.\n\nAfter the first few guitars, the Explorer had a long drooping headstock with the tuners placed in a straight line on one side (referred sometimes as \"banana\" and \"hockey-stick\"). This headstock design was incorporated by Grover Jackson, founder of Jackson Guitars and other electric guitar makers such as Kramer 20 years later, giving rise to the \"pointy-headstock era\" of guitars. However, the very earliest Explorers made between 1957 and spring 1958 featured an unusual \"split\"-shaped head with the tuners placed in a standard 3+3 arrangement, carried over from the Explorer prototype (better known as the Futura).\n\nThe 1958–1959 korina Explorer is one of the most valuable production-model guitars on the market, ranked at #4 on the 2011 Top 25 published by \"Vintage Guitar\", worth between $250,000 and $300,000. Only 22 were shipped in its first two years, 19 in 1958 and 3 in 1959; an unknown (small) number of leftover bodies were completed with nickel 1960s hardware and sold in 1963. 38 examples are presently known to exist.\n\nThere have been several variants produced by Gibson. These include several smaller-bodied, more \"user friendly\" versions such as the X-Plorer Studio; the Matthias Jabs-designed Explorer 90 (named so because it was 90% the body size of a regular Explorer), and the Explorer Pro, introduced in 2007.\n\nIn 1976 Gibson released a \"Limited Edition\" Explorer in mahogany with gold hardware.\n\nIn 1979 Gibson introduced the E2 model (also known as the Explorer II), featuring a 5-piece walnut/maple laminated construction and a contoured body. This model was discontinued after 1983, but was partially returned as the \"Thunderhorse\", a signature model for comedian/musician Brendon Small, which was heavily based on the E2.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1983 Gibson produced the \"Explorer II\", not to be confused with the later E/2 Explorers. The distinction is that the Explorer-II/E-II has a straight edge body with cream binding. These E-II's are made with a mahogany back and figured/flamed maple tops in \"burst\" colors, namely \"cherry-burst\" and \"Tobacco burst\". They did not come in clear or solid colored finishes. Also, they have the TP6 tail-piece, gold hardware, and \"velvet brick\" or \"dirty fingers\" pickups, cream color body binding, with a black pickguard and 3 knobs in a row. The necks have ebony fretboards. Those items together distinguish an Explorer II from the later E/2.\n\nFor the E/2 Explorer, Gibson optioned them with various different parts. The biggest difference was the curved/contoured body. Some came with \"dirty fingers\" pickups where some are cream and black colored (Zebra) or all black. Most had the standard stop-bar tailpiece, but some E/2's did come with a TP6 tailpiece. The E/2 was also offered in burst colors and clear finishes, whereas the E-II did not come in clear finishes.\n\nGibson also produced a range of Explorer models between 1981 and 1984 with high-output \"dirty fingers\" pickups, maple neck and body, and a bound figured maple top available in natural, cherry sunburst, or vintage (tobacco) sunburst finishes. These were alternately named E/2, Explorer CMT, or The Explorer. They could be equipped from the factory with either a standard tune-o-matic bridge/stopbar tailpiece or a Kahler tremolo.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1987 the standard Explorer's body wood varied between mahogany and alder. The neck wood would vary between maple and mahogany and the fretboard wood varied between Indian rosewood and ebony. Other additions to this model included rear-loaded pickup cavities, no pickguard, and control knobs arranged in a triangle pattern (rather than a straight line as on the original model).\n\nIn 1984 and 1985 Gibson produced the Explorer III, with three single-coil P-90 pickups and an alder body, as well as the Designer Series Explorer (and Flying V), which had factory-painted graphics in geometric and \"Artist Original\" designs.\n\nIn 1998 Gibson introduced an Explorer in its \"Gothic\" line, which featured Gibson's guitars (including the Explorer, Flying V, SG, and Les Paul) in matte black finishes.\n\nSeveral variants are also produced by Epiphone Gibson's lower-cost, non-US manufacturer. These include a model produced in korina wood and Epiphone's own \"Goth\" model, available with a stop-tail or Floyd Rose locking tremolo bridge. Epiphone also produced an Explorer Bass in ebony black and velvet natural finishes with two humbucking pickups and a 34\"-scale 22-fret dark rosewood fingerboard. The Explorer Bass employs a set-neck design rather than the bolted-neck construction used in the Epiphone version of the Gibson Thunderbird. (Gibson produced some 32\"-scale Explorer basses in the 1980s, including one model that featured a futuristic piezo pickup in place of the traditional pickups found on the other models)\n\nIn 2001 Gibson produced limited editions of Eric Clapton's modified 1958 Explorer, the Explorer Clapton Cut, featuring a shortened bass bout that allows more comfortable arm positioning and the Explorer Split Headstock, a faithful recreation of the original 1958 korina Explorer with the \"forked\" headstock found only on the very earliest examples..\n\nIn 2003 Gibson Guitars produced limited editions of Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Allen Collins's Gibson Explorer. The guitar is made of African limba wood and features an aged finish, Maestro vibrola, and classic humbucking pickups\n\nIn 2008 Gibson released two new versions of the guitar, the first of which was the \"50-Year Commemorative Explorer\". This version features a solid mahogany body with AA-grade maple top, and the body style is the so-called \"new retro Explorer\", which has rounded edges. The second is called the \"Reverse Explorer\" due to its inverted body style. The reverse model features a carbon fibre-like pickguard and inlays as well as a McCarty-era inspired headstock. Only a limited run of 1000 of each model were built for the Guitar of the Month feature. In the same year Gibson also released the Robot Explorer, an Explorer version of the Gibson Robot Guitar together with a similar version of the Flying V featuring custom red metallic nitrocellulose finish, ebony fingerboard with white lining and trapezoid inlays, and lacking a pickguard. Production of this guitar was discontinued in 2008.\n\nIn 2009 the company released two new versions of the guitar, the first of which is the Tribal Explorer. It features a Kahler-style tremolo and tribal designs and lacks a pickguard. The final new 2009 model is the Holy Explorer, designed as a counterpart to the Holy V, with numerous notches cut through the body of the guitar.\n\nAfter creating Matt Heafy of Trivium a white seven-string Explorer, Gibson released a statement that they would make a regular production version. It has many classic characteristics such as a rosewood fretboard, 22 frets, 24.75 scale length and a 12\" radius while acquiring some more metal-oriented hardware and styling with the addition of active EMG pickups (81-7 bridge & 707 neck), and no fretmarkers on the fretboard. \n\nAlthough thought to be a staple in the Gibson lineup, the Explorer was discontinued and brought back multiple times in the late 2000s, along with the Flying V. In 2014 a limited edition 120th Anniversary model, with a special 12th-fret inlay and neck binding, was made available. In 2016 the Explorer was brought back into the standard lineup.\n\nHamer Guitars created a tribute to the Explorer in 1974 called the Hamer \"Standard\". This model typically differed from the original Explorer in that it had no pickguard and a mahogany body with a highly figured maple top in a cherry sunburst finish, though custom finishes were also available. Gaining popularity with the hard rock musicians of the day, including Rick Nielsen, Hamer's success led the way for other copies and was partly responsible for prompting Gibson's own decision to reissue the Explorer.\n\nJackson Guitars (now a subsidiary of Fender) was sued by Gibson for their line of Kelly guitars, which are very similar to the Explorer. The Kelly was sleeker and lighter, with basically the same shape but with beveled edges.\n\nHigh-end guitar company Alembic Inc produced the Exploiter bass guitars for the late John Entwistle of the Who. These basses had the body shape of the Explorer with either a cone- or V-shaped headstock. The Exploiter is different in that the edges are rounded over and the lower bout cuts more deeply into the body than an Explorer. After Entwistle's death, Alembic released the \"Spyder\" based on John's custom basses, with production limited to 50 guitars. Warwick also produces the \"Stryker\" basses, based on the custom Explorer-style basses.\n\nDean Guitars produced a John Entwistle Spyder Signature Bass in 2013, limited to 25 US models and a low-cost Korean import series.\n\nIbanez introduced the Destroyer model in the 1970s, with a korina-coloured Japanese Sen body that closely resembled the original 1958 Explorer. In about 1981 Ibanez changed the shape of the Destroyer body. Although the new Destroyer II model was still clearly inspired by Gibson's original Explorer design, the body lines were modified, most notably around the treble \"horn\" and the rear edge, and the headstock was changed to a slight variation of the traditional Ibanez headstock shape, no longer resembling Gibson's \"hockey stick\" shape.\n\nOther guitars similar to the Explorer include the ESP EX Dean Guitars' Z, Greco guitars' Explorer, Aria Pro II, Kramer's Condor, Peavey's Rotor series, Rondo Music's Douglas Halo and Agile Ghost, Gordon-Smith's Explorer, Chapman's Ghost Fret, and the Cort Effector (an Explorer version with built-in effects, but no pickup toggle switch).\n\nGibson owns for the mark EXPLORER in connection with guitars. Gibson also owns for the Explorer's headstock design, and for the Explorer's body shape design. However, the enforceability of the latter two design trademarks is uncertain in light of Gibson's unsuccessful lawsuit against PRS Guitars for allegedly infringing Gibson's Les Paul shape. In 2005 the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ordered summary judgment against Gibson in that action, on the grounds that there was no evidence to support a finding of likelihood of confusion.\n\n\n"}

She was a contemporary of, and well known to, Abba Macarius and other Desert Fathers in Egypt, Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine of Hippo, Saint Paulinus of Nola (her cousin or cousin-in-law; he gives a colorful description of her visit to Nola in his Letters), and Evagrius of Pontus, and she founded two religious communities on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. She stands out for the convent she founded for herself and the monastery she established in honour of Rufinus of Aquileia, which belong to the earliest Christian communities, and because she promoted the asceticism which she, as a follower of Origen, considered indispensable for salvation.\n\nSt. Melania the Elder (325-410), one of the wealthiest citizens of the empire, was born in Spain, and was related to Paulinus of Nola. Her father, Marcellinus, was of consular rank. She married at fourteen, and moved with her husband, Valerius Maximus Basilius, Proconsul of Achaea and a Praefectus Urbi, to the suburbs of Rome. Her husband and two out of three sons had died by the time she was twenty-two. She became a Christian in Rome and, leaving her son, Valerius Publicola, with a guardian, set off to Alexandria, accompanied by her servants, to join other Christian ascetics to visit the monks at Nitria.\n\nShe stayed with the monks in the desert near Alexandria, Egypt (today the area is known as Wadi Natroun) for about six months. When persecution broke out after the death of Bishop Athanasius in 373 and many of the monks were exiled to Diocaesaraea in Palestine, St. Melania followed and supported them financially. The governor had her briefly imprisoned, but released her when he realized her social status. She built a convent in Jerusalem, and a monastery on the Mount of Olives for the monk and theologian Rufinus of Aquileia.\n\nBecause of her involvement as a pro-Origenist in the controversy over Origen in the 390s, Jerome was especially vitriolic about her, punning on her name and calling her \"black in name and black in nature.\" (He tried to expunge his earlier lavish praises of her from his writings.) Palladius of Galatia described her as \"a very learned lady who loved the world\".\n\nAround the year 400 she left for Rome to see her son, who had married Caeionia Albina, daughter of Caeionius Rufius Albinus. Due to her influence, her granddaughter, known as Melania the Younger would later take up the religious life. She also visited Paulinus and Therasia of Nola and brought him a relic of the True Cross. Augustine of Hippo wrote Paulinus that his kinswoman was in North Africa when her son, Valerius, died in 406.\n\nWhen the Visigoths marched on Rome in 410, Melania, her daughter-in law, Albina, and granddaughter Melania and her husband fled to Sicily. From there they went to the family estate at Thagaste in North Africa, where they remained for seven years. They then went to Jerusalem, where Melania died around 417.\n\nShe is regarded as a saint. Her feast day is June 8.\n\nShe was a spiritual mentor to Evagrius of Pontus, later author of the Eastern Orthodox Philokalia; she persuaded him to go to Egypt to join the desert ascetics and carried on a correspondence with him while he was there. \n\n\n"}

It is designed as a general purpose laboratory for experimental plasma physics research. The device began operation in 1991 and was upgraded in 2001 to its current version. The modern LAPD is operated as the primary device for a national user facility, the Basic Plasma Science Facility (or BaPSF), which is supported by the US Department of Energy, Fusion Energy Sciences and the National Science Foundation. Half of the operation time of the device is available to scientists at other institutions and facilities who can compete for time through a yearly solicitation.\n\nThe first version of the LAPD was a 10 meter long device constructed by a team led by Prof. Walter Gekelman in 1991. The construction took 3.5 years to complete and was funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). A major upgrade to a 20m version was funded by ONR and an NSF Major Research Instrumentation award in 1999. Following the completion of that major upgrade, the award of a $4.8 million grant by the US Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation in 2001 enabled the creation of the Basic Plasma Science Facility and the operation of the LAPD as part of this national user facility. Prof. Gekelman was director of the facility until 2016, when Prof. Troy Carter became BaPSF director.\n\nThe LAPD is a linear pulsed-discharge device operated at a high (1 Hz) repetition rate, producing a strongly magnetized background plasma which is physically large enough to support Alfvén waves. Plasma is produced from a barium oxide (BaO) cathode-anode discharge at one end of a 20-meter long, 1 meter diameter cylindrical vacuum vessel (diagram). The resulting plasma column is roughly 16.5 meters long and 60 cm in diameter. The background magnetic field, produced by a series of large electromagnets surrounding the chamber, can be varied from 400 gauss to 2.5 kilogauss (40 to 250 mT).\n\nBecause the LAPD is a general-purpose research device, the plasma parameters are carefully selected to make diagnostics simple without the problems associated with hotter (e.g. fusion-level) plasmas, while still providing a useful environment in which to do research. The typical operational parameters are:\n\n\nIn principle, a plasma may be generated from any kind of gas, but inert gases are typically used to prevent the plasma from destroying the coating on the barium oxide cathode. Examples of gases used are helium, argon, nitrogen and neon. Hydrogen is sometimes used for short periods of time. Multiple gases can also be mixed in varying ratios within the chamber to produce multi-species plasmas.\n\nAt these parameters, the ion Larmor radius is a few millimeters, and the Debye length is tens of micrometres. Importantly, it also implies that the Alfvén wavelength is a few meters, and in fact shear Alfvén waves are routinely observed in the LAPD. This is the main reason for the 20-meter length of the device.\n\nThe main source of plasma within the LAPD is produced via discharge from the barium oxide (BaO) coated cathode, which emits electrons via thermionic emission. The cathode is located near the end of the LAPD and is made from a thin nickel sheet, uniformly heated to roughly 900 °C. The circuit is closed by a molybdenum mesh anode a short distance away. Typical discharge currents are in the range of 3-8 kiloamperes at 60-90 volts, supplied by a custom-designed transistor switch backed by a 4-farad capacitor bank.\n\nA secondary cathode source made of lanthanum hexaboride (LaB) was developed in 2010 to provide a hotter and denser plasma when required. It consists of four square tiles joined to form a 20 formula_120 cm area and is located at the other end of the LAPD. The circuit is also closed by a molybdenum mesh anode, which may be placed further down the machine, and is slightly smaller in size to the one used to close the BaO cathode source. The LaB cathode is typically heated to temperatures above 1750 °C by a graphite heater, and produces discharge currents of 2.2 kiloamperes at 150 volts.\n\nThe plasma in the LAPD is usually pulsed at 1 Hz, with the background BaO source on for 10-20 milliseconds at a time. If the LaB source is being utilized, it typically discharges together BaO cathode, but for a shorter period of time (about 5–8 ms) nearing the end of each discharge cycle. The use of an oxide-cathode plasma source, along with a well-designed transistor switch for the discharge, allows for a plasma environment which is extremely reproducible shot-to-shot.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the BaO plasma source is its ability to act as an \"Alfvén Maser\", a source of large-amplitude, coherent shear Alfvén waves. The resonant cavity is formed by the highly reflective nickel cathode and the semitransparent grid anode. Since the source is located at the end of the solenoid which generates the main LAPD background field, there is a gradient in the magnetic field within the cavity. As shear waves do not propagate above the ion cyclotron frequency, the practical effect of this is to act as a filter on the modes which may be excited. Maser activity occurs spontaneously at certain combinations of magnetic field strength and discharge current, and in practice may be activated (or avoided) by the machine user.\n\nThe main diagnostic is the movable probe. The relatively low electron temperature makes probe construction straightforward and does not require the use of exotic materials. Most probes are constructed in-house within the facility and include magnetic field probes, Langmuir probes, Mach probes (to measure flow), electric dipole probes and many others. Standard probe design also allows external users to bring their own diagnostics with them, if they desire. Each probe is inserted through its own vacuum interlock, which allows probes to be added and removed while the device is in operation.\n\nA 1 Hz rep-rate, coupled with the high reproducibility of the background plasma, allows the rapid collection of enormous datasets. An experiment on LAPD is typically designed to be repeated once per second, for as many hours or days as is necessary to assemble a complete set of observations. This makes it possible to diagnose experiments using a small number of movable probes, in contrast to the large probe arrays used in many other devices.\n\nThe entire length of the device is fitted with \"ball joints,\" vacuum-tight angular couplings (invented by a LAPD staff member) which allow probes to be inserted and rotated, both vertically and horizontally. In practice, these are used in conjunction with computer-controlled motorized probe drives to sample \"planes\" (vertical cross-sections) of the background plasma with whatever probe is desired. Since the only limitation on the amount of data to be taken (number of points in the plane) is the amount of time spent recording shots at 1 Hz, it is possible to assemble large volumetric datasets consisting of many planes at different axial locations.\n\nVisualizations composed from such volumetric measurements can be seen at the LAPD gallery.\n\nIncluding the ball joints, there are a total of 450 access ports on the machine, some of which are fitted with windows for optical or microwave observation.\n\nA variety of other diagnostics are also available at the LAPD to complement probe measurements. These include photodiodes, microwave interferometers, a high speed camera (3 ns/frame) and laser-induced fluorescence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1887719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887719", "title": "HP Time-Shared BASIC", "text": "HP Time-Shared BASIC\n\nHP Time-Shared BASIC (HP TSB) is a BASIC programming language interpreter for Hewlett-Packard's HP 2000 line of minicomputer-based time-sharing computer systems. TSB is historically notable as the platform that released the first public versions of the game \"Star Trek\".\n\nThe system implements a dialect of BASIC as well as a rudimentary user account and program library that allows multiple people to use the system at once. The systems were a major force in the early-to-mid 1970s and generated a large number of programs. HP maintained a database of contributed-programs and customers could order them on punched tape for a nominal fee.\n\nMost BASICs of the 1970s trace their history to the original Dartmouth BASIC of the 1960s, but early versions of Dartmouth did not handle string variables and vendors added their own solutions. This led to two general styles; DEC introduced the codice_1 functions, while TSB used a system more akin to those in FORTRAN 77 or C where strings are arrays of characters and are parsed using array slicing syntax.\n\nAs microcomputers began to enter the market in the mid-1970s, many new BASICs appeared that based their parsers on DEC's or HP's syntax. Altair BASIC, the original version of what became Microsoft BASIC, was patterned on DEC's BASIC-PLUS. Others, including Apple's Integer BASIC, Atari BASIC and North Star BASIC were patterned on the HP style. This made conversions between these platforms somewhat difficult if string handling was encountered.\n\nThe software was also known by its versioned name, tied to the hardware version on which it ran, such as HP 2000C Time-Shared BASIC and the operating system came in different varieties — 2000A, 2000B, 2000C, High-Speed 2000C, 2000E, and 2000F.\n\nHP also referred to the language as \"Access BASIC\" in some publications. This matched the naming of the machines on which it ran, known as the \"2000/Access\" in some publications. This terminology appears to have been used only briefly when the platform was first launched.\n\nExcept for the 2000A and 2000E systems, the system is implemented using a dual-processor architecture. One fully configured HP 2100-series processor is used for the execution of most of the system code and all of the user code, while a second, smaller HP 2100-series processor is used to handle the RS-232 serial lines through which the time-sharing users connected. Depending on the hardware configuration, the system supports up to 16 or up to 32 simultaneous remote users.\n\nThe usual terminal for a TSB system was a Teletype Model 33 ASR and connected directly to the I/O processor or through a modem or acoustic coupler. Account names are a combination of one alphabetic character, followed by three decimal digits, \"e.g.\", B001. Privileged accounts started with the letter \"A\" and had some additional command and program storage capabilities. The superuser account is A000. This scheme allows up to 26,000 user accounts.\n\nDuring execution, user programs are swapped to a fixed head drive — physically a disk, but operating like a magnetic drum. When not executing, user programs are stored on moving-head cartridge- or pack-loaded disk storage. Privileged users can also store programs on the much-faster drum. The hard drive was backed up to magnetic tape.\n\nProgram and file names consist of a mix of up to six alphabetic characters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9). Programs are stored in a tokenized format, using the SAVE command. They can also be stored in a semi-compiled format, using the CSAVE command, which allows them to start quicker. Since the system was closely tied to the use of commonly available teleprinters, line endings in files consisted of the carriage return character (ASCII CR, 0D hexadecimal), followed by the linefeed character (ASCII LF, 0A hexadecimal).\n\nThe language is a fairly standard implementation of BASIC, providing an integrated editing and runtime environment. Statements are analyzed for correct syntax as they are entered and then stored in tokenized form. Each BASIC statement has to be on a uniquely numbered line, \"e.g.\"\n\n10 PRINT \"HELLO WORLD\"\n\nLine numbers are mandatory, and statements are automatically placed in ascending numeric sequence. TSB lines can contain one statement, chaining multiple statements with the colon as in MS BASIC is not supported. Multiple variable assignments are allowed, \"e.g.\", 20 LET A=B=C=42. As in most versions of BASIC, use of the word \"LET\" was optional.\n\nIn the earliest version (2000A), the language supported the following features. Later versions added many more features.\n\nStrings in TSB are treated as an array of characters, rather than a single multi-character object. By default, they are allocated one character in memory, and if a string of longer length is needed, they have to be codice_27entioned before use. For instance, DIM A$[10] will set up a string that can hold a maximum of 10 characters. The maximum length of a string in TSB is 72 characters.\n\nSubstrings within strings are accessed using a \"slicing\" notation: A$(L,R) or A$[L,R], where the substring begins with the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the rightmost character specified by the index R, or the A$[L] form where the substring starts at the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the end of the string. TSB accepts () or [] interchangeably. Array and substring indices start with 1.\n\nThis is in sharp contrast to BASICs following the DEC pattern that use functions such as codice_28, codice_29, and codice_30 to access substrings, although ANSI BASIC continues to use a similar substring syntax to that introduced by Hewlett-Packard. HP's notation can also be used on the destination side of a LET or INPUT statement to modify part of an existing string value, for example 100 A$[3,5]=\"XYZ\" or 120 B$[3]=\"CHANGE ALL BUT FIRST TWO CHARS\", which cannot be done with early implementations of LEFT/MID/RIGHT.\n\nThe main advantage to this style of string access is that it eliminates the need for complex memory management that is otherwise required when string lengths change. MS BASIC had a lengthy library to handle the compression of memory by removing dead space in the string heap when the system ran out of memory. It was also notoriously slow, and was modified several times over its lifetime in order to improve performance or fixe bugs. The downside to the TSB style is that the string always takes up the full amount of DIMed space even if the string inside is empty, and simple tasks like concatenation can potentially overflow the string unless it was set to a large size to begin with.\n\nLater versions of Dartmouth BASIC did include string variables, based on the same pattern found in BASIC-PLUS and MS BASIC. However, this version did not use the LEFT/MID/RIGHT functions for manipulating strings, but instead used the codice_31 command which converted the string to and from equivalent ASCII values. HP included identical functionality, changing only the name to codice_32. Additionally, one could use the single-quote to convert a numeric constant to an ASCII character, allowing one to build up a string in parts; codice_33 produced the string \"ABCDEF\", without the need for the codice_34 function.\n\nLater versions of Dartmouth BASIC included a suite of codice_35 commands that allowed operations on entire arrays (matrices) with a single statement. These were also available in later versions of TSB. In their simplest form, the codice_35 is used like an alternate form of codice_37, applying an expression to all the elements in an array. For instance:\n\n100 DIM A(20),B(20)\n200 MAT A=A+B\n\nWill add the value of every value in B to every entry in A, in the same fashion as:\n\n100 DIM A(20),B(20)\n200 FOR I=1 TO 20\n210 A[I]=A[I]+B[I]\n220 NEXT I\n\nAs well as making the code shorter and more obvious, these commands also have the advantage of being highly optimized, easily outperforming the use of FOR/NEXT. Additional functions and statements modify codice_15 and codice_13, invert arrays, and build identity matrixes and such in a single statement.\n\nTSB also includes a number of more minor differences with other dialects. Among the most important are:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1887751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887751", "title": "Aristo of Chios", "text": "Aristo of Chios\n\nAristo of Chios ( \"Ariston ho Chios\"; fl. c. 260 BC) was a Stoic philosopher and colleague of Zeno of Citium. He outlined a system of Stoic philosophy that was, in many ways, closer to earlier Cynic philosophy. He rejected the logical and physical sides of philosophy endorsed by Zeno and emphasized ethics. Although agreeing with Zeno that Virtue was the supreme good, he rejected the idea that morally indifferent things such as health and wealth could be ranked according to whether they are naturally preferred. An important philosopher in his day, his views were eventually marginalized by Zeno's successors.\n\nAristo, son of Miltiades, was born on the island of Chios sometime around 300 BC. He came to Athens where he attended the lectures of Zeno of Citium, and also, for a time, the lectures of Polemo, (the head of the Academy from 314 to 269). Although he was a member of Zeno's circle he soon departed from Zeno's teachings, largely rejecting the two non-ethical parts of Stoic philosophy – physics and logic – endorsed by Zeno.\n\nA man of persuasive eloquence, Aristo was such a good speaker that he was called \"the Siren\". He was also called \"Phalanthus\", from his baldness. He set up his own school in the Cynosarges gymnasium (a place associated with Cynic philosophy) and attracted many pupils, so much so that when he was accused of exposing the dignity of philosophy by his freedom to all-comers, he answered, that \"he wished that Nature had given understanding to wild beasts, that they too might be capable of being his hearers.\" His followers called themselves Aristonians and included the scientist Eratosthenes and the Stoics: Apollophanes, Diphilus, and Miltiades.\n\nAristo engaged in much debate with Arcesilaus, the leader of the Academy, defending Stoic epistemology against Arcesilaus's skeptical views. On one occasion he accused Arcesilaus of being: \"Plato the head of him, Pyrrho the tail, midway Diodorus\". meaning that Arcesilaus presented himself as a Platonist, the substance of what he taught was the dialectics of Diodorus, but his actual philosophy was that of Pyrrhonism.\n\nIn his old age, he reportedly lapsed from the Stoic ideal and indulged in pleasure. \"Eratosthenes the Cyrenean ... in his treatise which is entitled \"Ariston,\" represents his master as subsequently being much addicted to luxury, speaking as follows: \"And before now, I have at times discovered him breaking down, as it were, the partition wall between pleasure and virtue, and appearing on the side of pleasure.\" And Apollophanes (and he was an acquaintance of Ariston), in his \"Ariston\" (for he also wrote a book with that title), shows the way in which his master was addicted to pleasure.\" \n\nIt is not known when he died, but he is supposed to have died from sunstroke on account of his baldness.\n\nZeno divided philosophy into three parts: Logic (which was a very wide subject including rhetoric, grammar, and the theories of perception and thought); Physics (including not just science, but the divine nature of the universe as well); and Ethics, the end goal of which was to achieve happiness through the right way of living according to Nature. It is impossible to describe in full Aristo's philosophical system because none of his writings survived intact, but from the fragments preserved by later writers, it is clear that Aristo was heavily influenced by earlier Cynic philosophy:\n\nAristo regarded Logic as unimportant, saying that it had nothing to do with us. \"Dialectic reasonings,\" he said, \"were like cobwebs, artificially constructed, but otherwise useless.\" It is unlikely that he rejected all Logic, and it is notable that Zeno, too, compared the skills of dialecticians \"to right measures that do not measure wheat or anything else worthwhile but chaff and dung.\" According to Stephen Menn, Aristo recognized the need to add somehow disposed in relation to something to the Stoic Categories.\n\nAristo also rejected Physics, saying that it was beyond us. This is reflected in his views concerning God:\nAristo holds that no form of God is conceivable, and denies him sensation, and is in a state of complete uncertainty as to whether he is, or is not, animate.\nThis was in marked opposition to Zeno to whom \"the universe was animate and possessed of reason.\" He did, however, agree with Zeno that Nature was comprehensible, arguing against the Academics. He once asked an Academic \"Do you not even see the man who is sitting next to you?\", and when the Academic replied, \"I do not,\" Aristo said: \"Who then has blinded you; who has robbed you of your eyes?\"\n\nFor Aristo, Ethics was the only true branch of philosophy, but he also limited this category, removing its practical side: advice concerning individual actions was largely useless:\nHe holds that it does not sink into the mind, having in it nothing but old wives' precepts, and that the greatest benefit is derived from the actual dogmas of philosophy and from the definition of the Supreme Good. When a man has gained a complete understanding of this definition and has thoroughly learned it, he can frame for himself a precept directing what is to be done in a given case.\nFor Aristo, only the sage makes flawless decisions and does not need advice, for everybody else with clouded minds, advice is ineffective:\nFor precepts will be of no avail while the mind is clouded with error; only when the cloud is dispersed will it be clear what one's duty is in each case. Otherwise, you will merely be showing the sick man what he ought to do if he were well, instead of making him well.\nThe purpose of life was to seek the Supreme Good, and here Aristo set up a challenge to Zeno. While agreeing with Zeno that Virtue was the supreme good, he totally rejected the idea that external advantages (health, wealth, etc.), although morally \"indifferent\", could be ranked in terms of whether they are naturally preferred or not:\nAristo of Chios denied that health, and everything similar to it, is a preferred indifferent. To call it a preferred indifferent is equivalent to judging it a good, and different practically in name alone; For without exception things indifferent as between virtue and vice have no difference at all, nor are some of them preferred by nature while others are dispreferred, but in the face of the different circumstances of the occasions, neither those said to be preferred prove to be unconditionally preferred, nor are those said to be dispreferred of necessity dispreferred; For if healthy men had to serve a tyrant and be destroyed for this reason, while the sick had to be released from the service and, therewith also, from destruction, the wise man would rather choose sickness in this circumstance than health.\nZeno would have agreed that there could be circumstances when one might choose illness for the good of the world, but for Zeno, health is a naturally preferred state; Aristo rejected this. For Aristo, not only are there times when illness might be preferred over health, (health cannot always be unconditionally preferred), but health is not even a natural advantage, and one can \"never\" assume that it is better than illness. Although the sage can (and often must) choose between various indifferent things, he should never make the error of assuming that they could be naturally preferred.\n\nFor Zeno, the chief good was to live according to Nature; for Aristo, the chief good was:\nto live in perfect indifference to all those things that are of an intermediate character between virtue and vice; making not the slightest difference between them, but regarding them all on a footing of equality. For that the wise man resembles a good actor; who, whether he is filling the part of Agamemnon or Thersites, will perform them both equally well.\nThe highest good is thus to follow virtue as the supreme good, avoid vice as the supreme evil, and to live in a state of perfect indifference towards everything else. Aristo did, however, agree with Zeno on the unity of virtue, even if it is often labelled as different things:\nAristo made virtue one thing in its essence, and called it health; but in what it is somehow related to, he made the virtues differentiated and plural, just as if one wanted to call our vision in grasping light-colored things light-sight, but dark-sight in grasping dark-colored ones. For virtue in considering things to be done and not to be done is called wisdom, but it is called temperance in bringing order to our appetites and defining what is measured and timely in pleasures, and justice in busying itself with joint enterprises and contracts with other people.\nThe problem remains of how one can achieve a virtuous state if one can not make rational choices between which things in life are preferred and dispreferred and has only an abstract goal of perfect virtue. Aristo left the question unanswered, and Cicero writing in the first century BC gave what has been the standard view of Aristo's philosophy ever since:\nFor if we maintained that all things were absolutely indifferent, the whole of life would be thrown in confusion, as it is by Aristo, and no function or task could be found for wisdom, since there would be absolutely no distinction between the things that pertain to the conduct of life, and no choice need be exercised among them.\nWhether or not this view is correct, Aristo clearly thought he was doing something more positive than playing the Cynic and trying to undermine the roots of the Stoic system:\nHe who has equipped himself for the whole of life does not need to be advised concerning each separate item, because he is now trained to meet his problem as a whole; for he knows not merely how he should live with his wife or his son, but how he should live aright.\n\nAristo came to be regarded as a marginal figure in the history of Stoicism, but in his day, he was an important philosopher whose lectures drew large crowds. Eratosthenes, who lived in Athens as a young man, claimed that Aristo and Arcesilaus were the two most important philosophers of his age. But it was the more moderate Zeno, not the radical Aristo, whose views would win out. Chrysippus, (head of the Stoic school from c. 232-c. 206 BC), systemized Stoicism along the lines set down by Zeno, and in doing so, was forced to repeatedly attack Aristo:\n\nTo maintain that the only Good is Moral Worth is to do away with the care of one's health, the management of one's estate, participation in politics, the conduct of affairs, the duties of life; nay, to abandon that Moral Worth itself, which according to you is the be-all and the end-all of existence; objections that were urged most earnestly against Aristo by Chrysippus.\nAnd yet, Aristo never quite went away, as can be seen by the repeated references to his views by later writers. By outlining a version of Stoicism rooted in Cynic philosophy, he provided fruitful food for thought for both the supporters and the opponents of Stoicism ever since.\n\n\n"}

Just 115 Cougars were delivered.\n\nIn 1995 the type certificate for the GA-7 was sold to SOCATA of France who intended to produce the aircraft as the TB 320 Tangara for the training market. It was also to develop a variant with two Lycoming O-360-A1G6 engines of each and a re-designed cockpit, it was designated the TB 360. The first Tangara was a modified Cougar, had engines and first flew in mid-1996. The complete Tangara prototype was also a converted Cougar and had the engines. It first flew in February 1997.

He is best known as the former drummer for Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, which he co-founded with his brother Max in 1984. Max left the band in 1996, and Cavalera himself would depart ten years later, making him the last original member of Sepultura to leave the band. The brothers have since reunited in the band Cavalera Conspiracy.\n\nHe has played in the bands Nailbomb and Strife, and guest drumming in \"Brasileiro,\" a song by Titãs. As his hip-hop influences grew stronger he began to DJ. Cavalera is one half of DJ duo Mixhell, a project he founded with his wife Laima Leyton.\n\nCavalera started playing drums around 7 years old. He was into samba music as a child but, after watching Queen live in 1981 along with his brother Max, he started listening to rock music. When Sepultura was formed, Cavalera was the youngest member at the age of 13, his brother Max was 14 at the time. Sepultura was a big success and gave Cavalera an early start. On April 21, 1984, Cavalera played, for the first time, on a real drum kit, which was borrowed from Helinho of the band Overdose, that also played that night.\n\nAfter the band split with his brother Max (lead vocals/rhythm guitar) in 1996, their relationship underwent a crisis. In recent times their relationship has improved, with Max stating in an interview that a reunion with Sepultura was possible. Cavalera joined Max's current band Soulfly on stage at the 2006 tenth annual D-Low Memorial Show, to play the Sepultura songs \"Roots Bloody Roots\" and \"Attitude\". It was the first time the brothers had played together in ten years.\n\nIn 2006, with the release of \"Dante XXI\", he began spelling his name \"Iggor,\" preferring the way it looks. On January 13, 2006, it was announced that he was taking a break from the band due to the birth of his fourth child, initially leaving Sepultura temporarily. He later announced that he was quitting Sepultura due to \"artistic incompatibility.\" Sepultura replaced him with Jean Dolabella.\n\nCavalera was scheduled to collaborate with underground hip hop artist Necro, on a project described by Necro as in the style of \"old-school '80s thrash/death metal.\" However, Necro mentioned later that the project will not go ahead. In 2008 he released the album \"Inflikted\" together with his brother Max in a project named Cavalera Conspiracy.\n\nHe is credited as having made a guest appearance on Biohazard's 2001 release \"Uncivilization\" on the track \"Gone\".\n\nIn 2012, Cavalera performed drums for the entire Strife album Witness A Rebirth, released via 6131 Records.\n\nIn 2017, Cavalera performed drums for Soulwax on their album \"From Deewee\" and in their live tour, along with two other live drummers.\n\nIn 2018, Cavalera formed the Noise music duo PET BRICK with Wayne Adams of Big Lad and Death Pedals\n\nCavalera collects toys and football shirts and has many hobbies, including Brazilian jiu-jitsu, snowboarding, surfing, drawing and supporting Brazilian football club Palmeiras. He admires his father Graziano Cavalera as his role model. He has four children: Christian Bass Cavalera (b. November 7, 1996), Raissa Bass Cavalera (b. April 26, 2000), Iccaro Bass Cavalera (b. November 23, 2002), Antonio Leyton Cavalera (b. January 15, 2006) (the first with his current wife Laima Leyton) and a stepson Pedro Leyton Pereira. In 1996 he started the fashion label \"Cavalera\". He lives in London since 2013.\n\nCavalera cites drummers like Roger Taylor, Bill Ward, Dave Lombardo, Stewart Copeland and Mike Bordin among his major influences.\n\nIn the early Sepultura albums his drumming was loud and fast, following the thrash metal style of the 80s. He mastered this style by 1987–1991 (with \"Schizophrenia\", \"Beneath the Remains\" and \"Arise\"). His innovative style in the album \"Chaos A.D.\" brought tribal elements into the songs. One example of his contribution is the introduction of the song \"Territory\" (1993, \"Chaos A.D.\"). He further developed this style in the 1996 \"Roots\" album, adding more tribal elements to Sepultura's music.\n\nThroughout his career, Cavalera has been widely recognized as a hard-hitting drummer (acknowledged by producer Scott Burns during the recording of \"Beneath the Remains\"). In later years, Cavalera adopted a drumset conformation with upright toms and fewer cymbals, as seen in \"Live in São Paulo\". In reference to his work on the Sepultura album \"Nation\", Allmusic wrote \"Drummer Igor Cavalera's timing and tempo couldn't be more perfect as the adrenaline heightens until the album's intensity burns right through the speakers.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Villages near Vordermühle are Neeskotten, Klemenseichen, Wingenbach and Berrenberg.\n\nThree rivers run through this village: the \"Wingenbacher Siefen\", the \"Stüttemer Siefen\" and the \"Dierdorfer Siefen\".

The population of the surrounding villages gather there in May to pray.\n\nIn the year of 1843 the small chapel was destroyed; its owner, Peter Wilhelm Stege, r rebuilt the chapel. The new chapel was bigger, 22 feet long and 15 feet wide and had a small tower with a bell. The population of Vordermühle longed for the chapel's lustration in order to celebrate Mass in the chapel. It failed because the question of who paid the charges was unanswered.\n\nIn 1845 Peter Wilhelm Steger and his family donated the chapel to the catholic parish in Wipperfürth and announced together with Johann Peter Schnippering to care for the chapel.\n\nOn May the 17th 1845 priest Dünner lustrated the chapel to the Virgin Mother.\n\nIn 1857 a fire destroyed four houses and the chapel in Vordermühle.

The expenses were paid by a collection in the school district of Vordermühle. Till 2004 the mass was celebrated every month in the chapel. A lack of priests in Wipperfürth makes this no longer possible today.\n\nToday the former mill is a bakery with a water wheel.\n\nThe building of the former school is renovated and used as a tenement.

A pyramidal diamond point is pressed into the polished surface of the test material with a known (often 100g) load, for a specified dwell time, and the resulting indentation is measured using a microscope. The geometry of this indenter is an extended pyramid with the length to width ratio being 7:1 and respective face angles are 172 degrees for the long edge and 130 degrees for the short edge. The depth of the indentation can be approximated as 1/30 of the long dimension. The Knoop hardness \"HK\" or \"KHN\" is then given by the formula:\n\nwhere:\n\nHK values are typically in the range from 100 to 1000, when specified in the conventional units of kg·mm.

The main disadvantages are the difficulty of using a microscope to measure the indentation (with an accuracy of 0.5 micrometre), and the time needed to prepare the sample and apply the indenter.\n\nVariables such as load, temperature, and environment, may affect this procedure, which have been examined in detail.\n\n"}

A hostile crowd gathered, shots were fired, and three people (two Turkish Cypriots and one Greek Cypriot) were killed. As the news spread, members of underground organizations began firing and taking hostages. North of Nicosia, Turkish forces occupied a strong position at St. Hilarion Castle, dominating the road to Kyrenia on the northern coast. The road became a principal combat area as both sides fought to control it. Much intercommunal fighting occurred in Nicosia along the line separating the Greek and Turkish quarters of the city (known later as the Green Line).\n\nSevere intercommunal fighting occurred in March and April 1964. When the worst of the fighting was over, Turkish Cypriots began moving from isolated rural areas and mixed villages into enclaves. Turkish Cypriots state that the hostilities forced such an amalgamation while the Greek Cypriots state that the Turkish Cypriots did so without any pressure from them, but rather by the Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organization TMT so that to apply uniformity. It is believed by progressive Cypriots that both events occurred. Before long, a substantial portion of the island's Turkish Cypriot population was crowded into the Turkish quarter of Nicosia and other enclaves, in tents and hastily constructed shacks. Slum conditions resulted from the serious overcrowding.\n\nAttempts of the Cypriot National Guard under control of General George Grivas, who claimed to be acting under a mandate given to Cyprus by the UN, to re-capture a beach-head at the Kokkina/Erenköy enclave which the Turkish Cypriots claimed was their last link with the outside world but the Greek Cypriots feared would be used as a landing post for Turkish mainland forces, caused an intervention by the Turkish Airforce. On 8 – 9 August, Turkey bombed the Tylliria area for two days, resulting in the death of 33 Greek Cypriots and 230 injuries.\n\nPierre Oberling noted that according to official sources, the 1963–64 crisis resulted in the death of 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots. 209 Turkish Cypriots and 41 Greeks were reported as missing. Nearly 25,000 Turkish Cypriots, about one sixth of the Turkish Cypriot population at that time, had been forced to leave their homes to live into enclaves. Finally, more than 3000 Armenian ethnics who had been living in the areas of Nicosia that came under the control of Turkish paramilitaries were forced out of their homes.\n\nWith the coup d'état of 21 April 1967, Greece entered a period under the rule of the Colonels' Junta.\n\nOn 15 July 1974, the Republic of Cyprus government was overthrown by the Greek Cypriot national guard acting under orders from the Greek junta. The Greek junta installed an EOKA veteran and a member of the Cyprus Parliament, Nikos Sampson as the new president. The attempt to murder president Makarios failed, however, and he fled Cyprus with the help of the British army.\n\nOn 20 July 1974, in response to the coup, Turkish troops landed near Kyrenia, forcing a narrow corridor to Nicosia within 2 days, until a ceasefire was negotiated on 22 July. On the second day of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus the Colonels' Junta collapsed. Karamanlis returned from Paris and formed his civilian Government. In Cyprus, Nikos Sampson resigned and Glafkos Clerides took over the presidency as acting president, according to the 1960 Constitution. \n\nIn August of the same year, almost a month after the coup had dissolved the three guarantor powers, together with representatives of the two communities, met in Geneva. The Turkish Cypriots under Rauf Denktaş demanded a federal state with 34% of the territory ceded to Turkish Cypriots. Glafkos Klerides – the Greek Cypriot representative – asked for 36 to 48 hours in order to consult with his superiors. While still in talks, a second Turkish invasion was launched on Cyprus. When a ceasefire was declared, more than 36% of the territory was occupied by Turkish forces. The ceasefire line of 1974 today still separates the two communities and is generally referred to as the Green Line (or the 'Atilla Line'), and also runs through Nicosia, making it the only divided capital in the world.\n\nThe Turkish Army and the Greek side conducted policies ethnic cleansing in the territories that came under their respective control.\nTurkey was found guilty by the European Commission of Human Rights for displacement of persons, deprivation of liberty, ill treatment, deprivation of life and deprivation of possessions. The Turkish policy of violently forcing a third of the island's Greek population from their homes in the occupied North, preventing their return and settling Turks from the mainland there is considered an example of ethnic cleansing.\n\nIn 1976 and again in 1983, the European Commission of Human Rights found Turkey guilty of repeated violations of the European Convention of Human Rights. Turkey has been condemned for preventing the return of Greek Cypriot refugees to their properties. The European Commission of Human Rights reports of 1976 and 1983 state the following:\n\nEnclaved Greek Cypriots in the Karpass Peninsula in 1975 were subjected by the Turks to violations of their human rights so that by 2001 when the European Court of Human Rights found Turkey guilty of the violation of 14 articles of the European Convention of Human Rights in its judgement of Cyprus v. Turkey (application no. 25781/94), less than 600 still remained. In the same judgement, Turkey was found guilty of violating the rights of the Turkish Cypriots by authorising the trial of civilians by a military court.\n\nThe European commission of Human Rights with 12 votes against 1, accepted evidence from the Republic of Cyprus, concerning the rapes of various Greek-Cypriot women by Turkish soldiers and the torture of many Greek-Cypriot prisoners during the invasion of the island. The high rate of rape resulted in the temporary permission of abortion in Cyprus by the conservative Cypriot Orthodox Church. According to Paul Sant Cassia, rape was used systematically to \"soften\" resistance and clear civilian areas through fear. Many of the atrocities were seen as revenge for the atrocities against Turkish Cypriots in 1963–64 and the massacres during the first invasion. In the Karpass Peninsula, a group of Turkish Cypriots, called a \"death squad\", reportedly chose young girls to rape and impregnated teenage girls. There were cases of rapes, which included gang rapes, of teenage girls by Turkish soldiers and Turkish Cypriot men in the peninsula, and one case involved the rape of an old Greek Cypriot man by a Turkish Cypriot. The man was reportedly identified by the victim and two other rapists were also arrested. Raped women were sometimes outcast from society.\nGreek Cypriot EOKA-B militants committed a massacre in the village of Tochni, where all men between the ages of 13 and 74 were found shot (Tochni massacre). Likewise other mass graves were exhumed in the villages of Aloa, Sandalaris and Maratha, containing 126 dead civilians, including women and children (Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda massacre). There is also evidence of the rape of Greek Cypriot women by Turkish soldiers.\n\nIn 1976 and in 1983 Cyprus challenged Turkey at the European Court of Human Rights over a number of issues, including missing civilian Greek Cypriots, of which Cyprus claimed there were at least 1491. The ECHR concluded that there was a presumption that Turkey had a responsibility for clarifying the fate of civilians last known to be under its control, but also that there was \"no proof that any of the missing persons were killed in circumstances for which [Turkey] could be held responsible; nor did the Commission find \nany evidence to the effect that any of the persons taken into custody were still being detained or kept in servitude by [Turkey]\". A further 1994 case brought by Cyprus, on which judgement was made in 2001, concluded that Turkey continued to offer insufficient support in clarifying the fate of missing Cypriots. Another case is the book \"war crimes\" written by Andreas Parashos claiming at least 180 reported missings are fake and forged by Cyprus state, and 40 of them are already buried to the graves before 74, he also admitted killing 100 Turkish Cypriot civilians\n\nIn 2006, owing to the potential huge number of lawsuits against Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights called on Turkey in December to find \"effective domestic remedies\" for the mass displacement of Greek Cypriots. The result was a property commission established by the Turkish Cypriots purportedly offering right of return of Greek Cypriot properties so long as the property was unoccupied, or not in an area of military significance. A small number of applicants have received compensation. The Greek Cypriots have refused to recognise the commission as a proper means of redress, with some politicians going as far to suggest treason for those who accept. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the property commission does provide an adequate domestic remedy.(ref: Demopoulos & Ors -v- Turkey 1 March 2010) \n\n\n\n"}

The party's central governing body, the National Command, included representatives from its organisations in all the Arab countries where Baathists had a significant presence. Each branch of the party, in turn, had a local governing body, the Regional Command, and although practical power became centred in the Syrian and Iraqi Regional Commands and the National Command of each faction assumed an essentially symbolic role, the party split in 1966, with different factions taking control in Syria and Iraq, each faction retained a pan-Arab structure.\n\nAnother example of a transnational political party is Sinn Féin, which has 7 Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom Parliament, and 37 Teachtaí Dála in the Irish Dáil Éireann. Sinn Féin also has 26 MLAs in the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nSome transnational organisations also have a party-political dimension. The best example of this is the European Union, in which groups of national political parties operate together when participating in EU institutions, especially the European Parliament, as European political parties, or \"Europarties\". However, Europarties are distinct from transnational political parties in that they do not operate at the national level. \n\nIn a broad sense, global movements such as communism, socialism, and Islamism have transnational qualities, but in most such cases the party organization is separate in each country, with the transnational aspect being one more of consultatation and coordination, often through political internationals. One notable exception to this rule is the Progressive Labor Party (United States), which views proletarian internationalism as requiring that they set up party collectives all over the globe.

He is President of the Laboratory for Interactive Learning and widely known as a coauthor of \"The Limits to Growth\".\n\nDennis Meadows received a BA from Carleton College, a PhD in Management from the MIT Sloan School of Management, and holds four honorary doctorates.\n\nHe started working at the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1960s. From 1970 to 1972 at MIT he was director of the \"Club of Rome Project on the Predicament of Mankind\". Further on Meadows has been a tenured professor in faculties of management, engineering, and social sciences. For many years he was the director of a graduate program based in business and engineering. He has facilitated workshops and developed innovative and complex strategic games all over the world for decades. In addition, Dr. Meadows has lectured in over 50 countries.\n\nHe has been the Director of three university research institutes: at MIT, Dartmouth College and the University of New Hampshire. He is the Past President of the International System Dynamics Society and the International Simulation and Games Association.\n\nHe has been a corporate board member and a consultant for government, industry and non-profit groups in the U.S. and many countries abroad. He co-founded the Balaton Group, an international network of over 300 professionals in over 30 nations involved in systems science, public policy and sustainable development.\n\nHe has received numerous international awards for his work, including the Japan Prize in April 2009.\n\nThe Club of Rome is a global think tank that deals with a variety of international political issues. It was founded in April 1968 and raised considerable public attention in 1972 with its report \"The Limits to Growth\". From 1970 to 1972 at MIT Meadows was director of the \"Club of Rome Project on Predicament of mankind at MIT\" which constructed the world model underlying that publication.\n\n\"The Limits to Growth\" is a 1972 book modeling the consequences of a rapidly growing world population and finite resource supplies, commissioned by the Club of Rome. Meadows coauthored the book with his wife Donella H. Meadows, Jørgen Randers, and William W. Behrens III.\n\nThe book used the World3 model to simulate the consequence of interactions between the Earth's and human systems. Meadows led the team that developed this model. The book echoes some of the concerns and predictions of the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus in \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" (1798).\n\nThe eventual purpose of \"The Limits to Growth\" was not to make specific predictions, but to explore how exponential growth interacts with finite resources. Because the size of resources is not known, only the general behavior can be explored.\n\nThere has been a major cultural shift in the thinking about global processes in the last three decades of the 20th century. In a 2004 interview, Meadows explained:\n\nIn their 1972 publication \"Limits to Growth\", their recommendations were focused on \"how to slow growth\". In the 2004 \"Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update\", the message has changed. Meadows explained: \"Now we must tell people how to manage an orderly reduction of their activities back down below the limits of the earth's resources.\"\n\nIn 2014, research at the University of Melbourne confirmed that the predictions from the book \"Limits to Growth\" were largely correct.

Two or four players use solid paddles made of wood or composite materials to hit a perforated polymer ball, with 26-40 round holes, over a net. The sport shares features of other racquet sports: the dimensions and layout of a badminton court, and a net and rules somewhat similar to tennis, with several modifications. Pickleball was invented in the mid 1960s as a children's backyard game.\n\nThe game started during the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, at the home of Joel Pritchard, who later served in Congress and as lieutenant governor. He and two of his friends, Bill Bell and Barney McCallum, returned from golf and found their families bored one Saturday afternoon. They attempted to set up badminton, but no one could find the shuttlecock. They improvised with a Wiffle ball, lowered the badminton net, and fabricated paddles of plywood from a nearby shed.\n\nMcCallum made the first paddles that were specifically for paddleball on his basement bandsaw. He tried several alternative paddles, but one he called “M2” become the paddle of choice for most players. In 1972, McCallum incorporated Pickle-Ball, Inc. and manufactured wooden paddles to help grow the sport. His son David McCallum now runs the business, which is headquartered in Kent, Washington. \n\nSome sources claim that the name \"Pickleball\" was derived from that of the Pritchard's family dog, Pickles, or from the term \"pickle boat\". According to Joan Pritchard, Joel Pritchard's wife, “The name of the game became Pickle Ball, after I said it reminded me of the Pickle Boat in crew where oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats. Somehow the idea the name came from our dog Pickles was attached to the naming of the game, but Pickles wasn’t on the scene for two more years. The dog was named for the game, but stories about the name’s origin were funnier thinking the game was named for the dog.\"\n\nThe pickleball court is similar to a doubles badminton court. The actual size of the court is 20 by 44 feet for both doubles and singles. The net is hung at 36 inches on the ends, and 34 inches at center. The court is striped like a tennis court, with no alleys; but the outer courts, and not the inner courts, are divided in half by service lines. The inner courts are non-volley zones and extend 7 feet from the net on either side.\n\nThe ball is served with an underarm stroke so that contact with the ball is made below waist level (waist is defined as the navel level) in an upward arc. The server hits from behind the baseline on one side of the center line and aims diagonally to the opponent's service court (as in the figure on the right).\n\nOnly the serving side may score a point. Play ends for a point when one side commits a \"fault\". Faults include:\n\nA player may enter the non-volley zone to play a ball that bounces and may stay there to play balls that bounce. The player must exit the non-volley zone before playing a volley.\n\nThe first side scoring 11 points leading by at least two points wins the game. If the two sides are tied at 10 points apiece, the side that goes ahead by two points wins the game.\n\nTournament games may be played to 11, 15 or 21 points with players rotating sides at 6, 8 or 11 total points respectively.\n\nThe server or server and partner usually stay at the baseline until the first return has been hit back and bounced once.\n\nAt the beginning of a doubles game before any serving, the score is 0–0. Then the side serving first gets only one fault before their side is \"out\", meaning that their opponents serve next. After the first fault each side gets 2 faults (one for each team member serving) before their side is \"out\".\n\nIn singles play, each side gets only one fault before a side out and the opponent then serves. The server's score will always be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...) when serving from the right side, and odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9...) when serving from the left side.\n\nPara-Pickleball, or wheel chair pickleball, was officially recognized as a competitive branch of Pickleball by the United States of America Pickleball Association in 2016. Rules for those in wheelchairs are similar to the standing rules with minor alternatives. The player's wheelchair is considered to be part of the player's body and all applicable rules that usually apply to the body will also apply to the player's wheelchair. A pickleball player in a wheelchair is allowed two bounces instead of the one a standup player would receive. When a player in a wheelchair is serving the ball, they must be in a stationary position. They are then allowed one push before striking the ball for service. When the player strikes the ball, the wheels of the wheel chair shall not touch any baselines, sidelines, center lines or the extended center or sidelines. When there is a mixed game of those in wheelchairs and those standing, the applicable rules apply for those players respectively. Standing players will adhere to the standing pickleball rules and the wheelchair players will adhere to the wheelchair pickleball rules.\n\n\n"}

He was elected Grand Master in June 1151, after the abdication of Everard des Barres, who had returned to France following the Second Crusade. King Baldwin III of Jerusalem granted him the ruined city of Gaza, which Bernard rebuilt for the Templars.\n\nIn 1153 the Templars participated in the Battle of Ascalon, a fortress at that time controlled by Fatimid Egypt. The Templars constructed a siege tower, which was burned down by the Egyptian soldiers inside Ascalon. The wind caught the flames and part of the walls of Ascalon burned down as well.\n\nAccording to William of Tyre, knights of the Order rushed through the breach without Baldwin's knowledge while Bernard prevented other crusaders from following, as he did not want to share the spoils of the city with the king. Bernard and about forty of his Templars were killed by the larger Egyptian garrison. Their bodies were displayed on the ramparts and their heads were sent to the sultan. Other more modern accounts say that William of Tyre's version may have been distorted, since it may have been based on the defensive accounts given by the army's commanders as to why they did not follow the Templars into the breach.\n\nIn yet another differing account by a Damascene chronicler in the city, the breach of the wall is mentioned as a precursor to the fall of the city; he makes no mention of the incident with the Templars.\n\nRegardless of which account is believed, Bernard was killed and beheaded during the fighting.\n\nA few days later, Baldwin captured the fortress; shortly thereafter, the Templars elected André de Montbard as their Grand Master.\n\n"}

Williams\n\nReginald Murray \"R.M.\" Williams AO, CMG (24 May 19084 November 2003) was an Australian bushman and entrepreneur who rose from a swagman to a millionaire, he was born at Belalie North near Jamestown in the Mid North of South Australia, 200 kilometres north of Adelaide, into a pioneering settler family working and training horses. R.M. had many adventures in Australia's rugged outback as a bushman, and became known for creating an Australian style of bushwear clothing and footwear recognised worldwide and the company that bore his name.\n\nFrom Welsh ancestors, his maternal grandfather Richard Mitchell being from Cornwall, Reginald Murray Williams was born to Joe Williams and his wife.\n\nWhen he was 10 years old, R.M.'s family moved to Adelaide so that he and his two sisters could attend school there. School did not agree with R.M. and so, at 13, R.M. packed his swag and left for the land he loved. At 18 he started work as a camel driver and spent 3 years trekking through the Australian desert, living with Indigenous Australians and learning to survive the harsh conditions. During the Great Depression, R.M. returned to Adelaide, where he met Thelma Ena Cummings, who would become his first wife After they married, they settled in South Australia's Flinders Ranges and had six children.\n\nAfter the marriage broke up in the 1950s, Williams purchased 55 hectares of land behind Yatala Labour Prison, South Australia. There, R.M. constructed a homestead, planted vineyards and thousands of roses, and ran rodeos on the floodplain of Dry Creek. When the land was compulsorily acquired during the time of former State Premier Sir Thomas Playford, R.M. left South Australia for his \"Rockybar\" property in Eidsvold, Queensland, vowing never to return to South Australia.\nHe remarried in 1955 to Erica, had four more children, living at the North Burnett \ncattle station in Queensland. In 1985, he co-wrote his autobiography, \"Beneath whose hand\". In 2003 Williams died at his home in Toowoomba on the Darling Downs in Queensland.\n\nR.M. learned his leather-working skills from a horseman called Dollar Mick, making bridles, pack saddles and riding boots. In 1932, with his son's illness and the expense of hospital treatment, he was in need of money and began selling his saddles to Sir Sidney Kidman, a wealthy pastoralist. R.M. soon had a small factory running in his father's back shed in Adelaide that rapidly expanded. To address financial problems, he also became involved with the Nobles Nob gold mine, near Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory.\nWilliams established a national magazine, \"Hoofs and Horns\", in 1944, aimed at cattlemen and horsemen.\n\nWilliams' most successful products were handcrafted riding boots. Williams' boots were unique when they were introduced to the market, as they consisted of a single piece of leather that was stitched at the rear of the boot (the models that featured an elastic side have been particularly popular).\n\nFollowing the founding of the R.M. Williams company in 1932, Williams sold the business in 1988 to the long established South Australian stock and station agents Bennett & Fisher Limited. That business went into receivership in 1993, after banks were concerned about $16 million AUD of debts.\n\nR.M. Williams Pty Ltd was then placed under the ownership of long-time friend Ken Cowley, who acted in partnership with Australian business mogul Kerry Stokes, and together with his family, presided over R.M. Williams Pty Ltd for two decades.\n\nIn 1985 Williams was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), for services to the outback community.\n\nIn 1992 he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), for service to business and to the community.\n\nIn 2001 he was awarded the Centenary Medal.\n\nThe bush businessman has left several legacies:\n\n\nA major road in South Australia's mid north, which runs between Stanley Flat (near Clare) and Hawker, via Jamestown has been named the RM Williams Way in his honour. \n\n\nAnother book by RM Williams:\n\nWilliams also published the 300+ pages of poetry anthology \"Saddle for a throne\" in 1953. The poems of Scottish-Australian bush poet Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) struck fondness with Williams who shared the affinity of Ogilvie with horses and the Australian Outback.\n\n\n"}

Other related mistreatment of Judas effigies include hanging, flogging, and exploding with fireworks. Anthropologists generalize these types of activities as \"scapegoating rituals\". A similar ritual in Jewish tradition would be the hanging and burning an effigy of Haman and his ten sons during Purim, although this is not a widespread contemporary practice.\n\nThough not an official part of the Easter liturgical cycle, the custom is typically a part of the reenactment of the story of the Passion that is practiced by the faithful during Easter. Customs vary, but the effigy of Judas is typically hanged (reenacting ) on Good Friday, then burned on the night of Easter Sunday.\n\nIn many parts of Latin America this practice occurs on the eve of the New Year as a symbol of ridding one's self of evil and beginning a new year in spiritual purity. Some communities observe this ritual using various effigies, including the biblical Judas (who betrayed Jesus). This custom, during which the effigy is burned on a stake, is called \"Quema del Judas\" (\"the burning of Judas\") in Uruguay and Argentina, and \"Quema del Año Viejo\" (\"the burning of the old year\") in other places.\n\nThe burning of Judas was once widely practiced across the Christian world in England, Greece, Mexico, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Spain, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, Cyprus where it is called 'lambratzia', the Philippines, Paraguay—where it is called 'Judas kái', Nigeria, and elsewhere. These folk traditions are still practiced today in many of those countries.\n\nThe Czech tradition of drowning and burning an effigy of Judas (\"vodění Jidáše\") is still practiced in a number of villages in the Pardubice Region. The Czech mint issued a gold coin in 2015 to commemorate this folk custom, which was nominated for UNESCO protection as part of that nation's cultural heritage.\n\nJudas burnings also took place in the district of Dingle, in Liverpool, England, in the early and mid twentieth century, but was often stopped by the police. In Liverpool's South End bands of children still practiced this custom in the late twentieth century. The very last burning of the Judas was in 1971 and was conducted by local legend Alan Rietdyk on waste ground between Prophet Street and Northumberland Street \nin the Liverpool 8 area. The burning of Judas is not traditional to England, although a very similar custom of burning Catholic rebel Guy Fawkes in effigy exists. The practice of burning an effigy of the Pope Paul V also continues to exist in England, where as many as 50,000 Protestants gather on Bonfire Night in Lewes to observe the festivities.\n\nThe custom of \"burning of Judas\" (widespread around Greece and sometimes called \"burning of the Jew\"), as well as its repeated criticism by the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (KIS) and official denunciation by the Greek Orthodox Church is regularly cited in the United States State Department's Religious Freedom Report for Greece. \nIn Latin America, despite the controversial nature of anti-Semitism associated with the \"burning of the Jew\" (one of the custom's many monikers), although the practice does exist in the above stated form it is not regarded as an act of hostility towards the Jewish nation or ethnicity but is simply representative of \"evil\", thus not differing in any way from the other effigies listed.\n"}
{"id": "1887852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887852", "title": "Keystone (cask)", "text": "Keystone (cask)\n\nA keystone is a small wooden or plastic fitting used in ale casks. \n\nFor some years wooden casks have been effectively obsolete, with the majority now being aluminium or stainless steel, and a few sturdy plastic ones beginning to appear. Nevertheless, the standard tap is still designed to be hammered into yielding material, punching a hole as it goes. All modern casks, even the few wooden ones still in use, use a replaceable keystone to accept the tap.\n\nThe bung-hole of the cask is on one of the circular faces, near the rim. When the cask is in service, it is laid on its side with the bunghole at the lowest point on the circumference. The keystone is a small thick wooden or plastic disk inserted into the bunghole which completely seals the cask until it is needed. \n\nThe centre of the keystone is deliberately weakened, this area may be marked or unmarked and is called the tut. In the plastic variety it is much thinner than the surrounding material; if made of wood it is partially pre-cut so that it is easier to punch out. Some time before the cask is to be served, the end of the tap is placed against this weakened section and, with the aid of a mallet, driven through it. The shaft of the tap is tapered, so that as it is forced in fully it seals against the undisturbed outer part of the keystone. A small amount of beer may leak out during this process, but with sufficient skill and firm action with the mallet, no spillage at all can occur.\n\nWhen the cask is empty, it is a courtesy to the drayman (the brewery's delivery driver who also collects the empty casks) to stop up the hole in the keystone with a small cork bung which can be obtained for this purpose. This prevents old beer being spilled on him or in his vehicle. Similarly, the shive hole may be sealed with a spile.\n\nIt is common for wooden keystones to acquire a layer of mould on the outside between filling and tapping. This does not indicate a problem with the beer, but because part of the keystone is driven into the cask (where it floats on top of the beer) it must be thoroughly cleaned before the cask is tapped. This action is worthwhile even when plastic keystones are used.\n\nDue to the somewhat rustic nature of this standard connection system, leaks occasionally appear. If beer is leaking around the tap then hammering it further in will normally fix the problem; otherwise the keystone itself may be split or the tap may be faulty and the offending item will need to be changed.\n\nBecause of the way ale is conditioned, upending the cask to bring the keystone above the level of the liquid would render the beer undrinkable for at least a day and probably longer, and depending on the condition of the finings may have a permanent effect. Instead, the keystone must be changed in situ. Perhaps surprisingly, this can be achieved without serious loss of beer - half a pint or so is reasonable and half that again is eminently possible.\n\n\nIf the tap is the problem, one may either replace the keystone as above and insert a new tap, or perform a similar operation but removing only the tap, leaving the keystone in place, and quickly inserting a new tap in the hole. Some authorities recommend using a small cork bung between removing the old tap and inserting the new one.\n\n This is more likely to be the case at beer festivals where there are many taps, infrequently used and maintained. A possibly-faulty tap is not worth having in a pub where casks are changed all year round.\n"}

He married Marie Ernestine of Schwarzenberg, who was a member of the noble House of Schwarzenberg. Upon the death of Johann Christian, the male line of the House of Eggenberg came to an end. \n\nThe death of Marie Ernestine in 1719 caused the Bohemian possessions of the Eggenbergs to pass to her closest relatives in the Schwarzenberg family.

He grew up near Sneedville, singing in church and with friends from surrounding farms. His mother and stepfather who used to sing gospel were his first influences. When he was in his teens he bought a guitar. Martin told \"The Big Book of Bluegrass\": \"I learned the basic chords from an old hillbilly named Reuben Gibson, who lived in the hills around Sneedville, and I taught myself how to play. I heard Lester Flatt and Charlie Monroe both play runs, but I didn't try to top them. I mostly just developed them how I felt, when it came natural for a song.\" \nIn his teens, he played guitar in a local string band and later appeared on radio with Tex Climer and the Blue Band Coffee Boys.\n\nIn the winter of 1949, Mac Wiseman had just left Bill Monroe's \"Blue Grass Boys\". Martin, who wanted to apply for the vacant post as guitarist, rode the bus into Nashville. He sneaked in backstage at the Grand Ole Opry. While picking his guitar, he was overheard by Blue Grass Boys\" banjo player Rudy Lyle who brought him forward and presented him to Monroe. Martin sang two songs with Monroe and was hired instantly.\n\nBeginning in 1949 Martin was lead vocalist for Bill Monroe's \"Blue Grass Boys\". Martin's high voice mixed with Monroe's tenor came to be known as the \"high lonesome\" sound. His influence radically changed Monroe's music from the fast-paced but smooth style of the \"original\" 1945 band with Flatt and Scruggs. Martin challenged Monroe to raise the pitch on many of his classics and to write new, \"lonesome\" songs. This band with Rudy Lyle (banjo) and Charlie Cline (fiddle) was one of the many high points of Monroe's career. Martin's lead was defining in \"lonesome\" songs such as \"Sitting Alone in the Moonlight\", \"Memories of Mother and Dad\" and \"I'm Blue, I'm Lonesome\".\n\nMartin had a famously high-strung and exuberant personality, and inevitably clashed with Monroe's equally stubborn temperament.\nHe left Monroe and worked briefly with the Osborne Brothers until he formed his own band, \"The Sunny Mountain Boys\" in 1955. The classic lineup of this band, with J. D. Crowe and \"Big\" Paul Williams (stage name for Paul Humphrey) defined his \"Good 'n Country\" style, a commercially oriented, crowd-pleasing bluegrass with simple harmonies, catchy melodies, and a strong rhythm propelled by Martin's effective guitar playing. He credited himself with inventing the \"G\" run- a guitar lick used widely in the bluegrass genre. However, aural evidence from the period before Martin began performing professionally clearly shows Lester Flatt using this run when backing Bill Monroe.\n\nThree important components of Martin's unique sound, besides his cutting tenor voice, were tight trio singing, sometimes a female high-baritone fourth part, and the use of a snare drum in place of mandolin to keep the back-beat.\n\nAmong Martin's biggest hits of the 1960s were \"Hit Parade of Love\", \"Sophronie\", \"Stepping Stones\", \"Tennessee\", and \"Widow Maker\" (a popular truck driver's song). His instrumentals (with the Sunny Mountain Boys) such as \"Theme Time\", \"Bear Tracks\" and \"Red Rooster\" featured ultra-crisp playing by a series of banjo players including Sam \"Porky\" Hutchins, J.D. Crowe, Vernon McIntyre Jr. and Bill Emerson, and powered by Martin's guitar runs, set a standard for bluegrass instrumentals that was highly influential.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Jimmy Martin's Sunny Mountain Boys included singer and instrumentalist Gloria Belle, who is considered the first female lead singer in bluegrass. She toured Japan with Martin during 1975. In regards to her playing, Martin said jokingly, \"She's not very good, but we let her sing with us 'cause we feel sorry for her.\"\n\nMartin was famous as a dangerously unpredictable but highly entertaining stage presence. He freely acknowledged his problems with drinking and volatile mood swings, which kept him from realizing his lifelong dream of joining the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nHe made frequent appearances on the Louisiana Hayride and Wheeling, West Virginia's WWVA Jamboree (renamed Jamboree U.S.A. in the 1960s), as well as the Grand Ole Opry, but was never invited to join the latter. In 1973, he performed on Bill Monroe's Brown County Jamboree.\n\nHe performed on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1971 album, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" as well as Volume II (1989) and Volume III (2002).\n\nHe joined producers Randall Franks and Alan Autry for the In the Heat of the Night (TV Series) cast CD \"Christmas Time's A Comin'\" performing \"Christmas Time's A Comin'\" with the cast on the CD released on Sonlite and MGM/UA for one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.\n\nMartin died in Nashville on May 14, 2005, after having been diagnosed with bladder cancer more than a year earlier. He is interred in the Spring Hill Cemetery in Nashville's Madison neighborhood. A report of his death in the \"Toronto Star\" called him \"one of the greatest vocalists in bluegrass\".\n\nIn 1995, Martin was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor. A documentary on his life, \"King of Bluegrass: The Life and Times of Jimmy Martin\", was released in 2003. Martin is also featured in the documentary film \"High Lonesome\".\n\nMartin's hobby was raccoon hunting with dogs; he featured his hunting dogs on the covers of several LP albums and wrote songs celebrating their prowess.\nHis troubles with the Nashville music industry are memorialized in \"The Death of Jimmy Martin\", a song by Tom Russell on \"The Wounded Heart of America\" album.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1887912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887912", "title": "Letter-quality printer", "text": "Letter-quality printer\n\nA letter-quality printer was a form of computer impact printer that was able to printing with the quality typically expected from a business typewriter such as an IBM Selectric.\n\nA letter-quality printer operates in much the same fashion as a typewriter. A metal or plastic printwheel embossed with letters, numbers, or symbols strikes an inked ribbon, depositing the ink (or carbon, if an expensive single-strike ribbon was installed) on the page and thus printing a character. \n\nOver time, several different technologies were developed including automating ordinary typebar typewriter mechanisms (such as the Friden Flexowriter), daisy wheel printers (dating from a 1939 patent, but brought to life in the 1970s by Diablo engineer David S. Lee) where the type is moulded around the edge of a wheel, and \"golf ball\" (the popular informal name for \"typeball\", as used in the IBM Selectric typewriter) printers where the type is distributed over the face of a globe-shaped printhead (including automating IBM Selectric mechanisms such as the IBM 2741 terminal). The daisy wheel and Selectric-based printers offered the advantage that the typeface was readily changeable by the user to accommodate varying needs. \n\nThese printers were referred to as \"letter-quality printers\" during their heyday, and could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter (though they were nowhere near the quality of printing presses). Most were available either as complete computer terminals with keyboards (or with a keyboard add-on option) that could double as a typewriter in stand-alone (\"off-line\") mode, or as print-only devices. Because of its low cost at the time, the daisy wheel printer became the most successful, the method used by Diablo, Qume, Brother and Apple.\n\nLetter-quality impact printers, however, were slow, noisy, incapable of printing graphics or images (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and limited to a fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix printers (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer \"Near Letter Quality\" (NLQ) modes which were much faster than daisy-wheel printers, could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than \"letter quality\". Nowadays, printers using non-impact printing (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications. The quality of inkjet printers can approach the old letter-quality impact printers (but can be limited by factors such as paper type).\n\nDedicated word processors and WP software for general-purpose computers that rose in popularity in the late 1970s and 1980s would use features such as microspacing (usually by 1/120 of an inch horizontally and, possibly, 1/48 of an inch vertically) to implement subscripts, proportional spacing, underlining, and so on. The more rudimentary software packages would implement bold text by overtyping the character in exactly the same spot (for example, using the backspace control code), but better software would print the letter in 3 slightly different positions. Software did exist to (slowly) produce pie charts on such printers (and on some daisywheels the dot was reinforced with metal to cope with extra wear).\n\n"}

Founded in 1975, NUDM is one of the nation's most established and largest entirely student-run philanthropies. NUDM is one of the only annual Dance Marathons in the country to continually change its primary beneficiary. NUDM has raised over $1 million for its beneficiaries each year since 2011, and involves over 1,000 students participating as dancers and committee members. Since 1997, the Evanston Community Foundation has been NUDM's secondary beneficiary.\n\nIn 2020, NUDM supported Children's Home and Aid and the Evanston Community Foundation (ECF). NUDM focused its efforts on supporting Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Child & Family Center, located in Evanston, via both fundraising and service. The 30-hour dance marathon was unexpectedly and unprecedentedly canceled in 2020 by the Northwestern Administration on March 4th, two days before it was set to kick-off, due to health concerns with “uncertainty surrounding COVID-19” (i.e. novel coronavirus). The NUDM Executive Board ultimately implemented a \"virtual\" NUDM, posting videos, quotes and thank you's via social media, which raised over $1 million - $1,029,366 exactly.\n\nFor its 45th year, NUDM supported Communities in Schools of Chicago (CIS) and the Evanston Community Foundation, raising $1,114,514.62. CIS is a nonprofit organization that works to ensure that each and every public school student in Chicago graduates high school prepared for success. CIS believes that dropping out of school is a continuous process, not a single event— and so they strive to connect students to mentors and resources to end that process. \n\nIn 2018, NUDM raised $1,175,709.82 for Cradles to Crayons and the Evanston Community Foundation. Cradles to Crayons provides children from birth through age 12, living in homeless or low-income situations, with the essential items they need to thrive – at home, at school and at play. To further Cradles to Crayons’ cause, NUDM celebrated a yearlong philanthropic effort to connect communities and enable childhood dreams.\n\nIn May 2016, GiGi's Playhouse was announced as the primary beneficiary for NUDM 2017. GiGi's Playhouse is a nationwide network of Down syndrome achievement centers that impacts the lives of children and adults with Down syndrome through free educational and therapeutic programs. Through its partnership with GiGi's, NUDM hopes to improve the lives of individuals with Down syndrome and simultaneously share a message of global acceptance for people of all abilities.\n\nFor the 20th consecutive year, the Evanston Community Foundation was announced as NUDM 2017's secondary beneficiary to honor the close relationship between Northwestern University and the city of Evanston.\n\nNUDM 2016 raised $1,201,216.24 for Blessings in a Backpack, a leading childhood hunger organization that mobilizes communities, individuals and resources to provide food on the weekends for elementary school children across America. NUDM fed more than 9,400 elementary schoolers that come from food insecure homes and made a direct impact on hunger in the Evanston and Chicago area, through both the expansion of programs at existing schools and the initiation of programs at new schools.\n\nIn 2015, NUDM raised $1,130,979 for Starlight Children's Foundation, a global organization that supports critically and chronically ill children and their families from hospital to home. This money supported the creation of 11 \"Starlight Sites,\" beautifully designed pediatric treatment rooms and playrooms reaching nearly 477,865 children in just one year.\n\nFor its 40th year, NUDM supported Team Joseph, raising a record-breaking $1,385,273 to fund research to find a cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. This remains the highest total ever raised for the event.\n\nForty-seven years ago, Dance Marathon, the philanthropic child of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and the Associated Student Government, was born on the Northwestern University campus.\n\nThe Dance Marathon was inspired by NU's participation in the University of Illinois dance marathon in 1974. After representing NU at UI, Jan Jacobowitz approached Tim Rivelli, Associated Student Government Vice President, with the idea of starting a dance marathon at Northwestern. Tim and Jan met with representatives of the American Epilepsy Foundation and the Dance Marathon was born. Tim's fraternity, ATO, took charge of the operation and ran the dance marathon.\nTwenty-one couples danced for NUDM in 1975. It was called the \"Dance to Give Them a Chance\" marathon then, and it benefited the American Epilepsy Foundation and the National Association for Retarded Citizens. Fifteen couples made it through the fifty-two-hour marathon, raising $9,105 at Blomquist Memorial Gymnasium. The winning couple, Donna Miller and Tony Krileff, was sponsored by Bobb Hall and a local liquor store.\n\nNUDM 1976 saw a new venue as the dancing was moved to Patten Gym and the dancing time was lessened to twenty-six hours. When the sponsor decided to discontinue the event after two years, Triangle Fraternity picked up the mantle and looked for a venue where other fund-raising events were possible. In 1977, NUDM found its current home: the Norris University Center, where students have been dancing for thirty hours at a time ever since. To institutionalize the event for the long haul and ensure a continuing flow of good ideas from students, organizers turned it into a campus-wide charitable event.\n\nSpecial events to raise extra money for the cause were added over the years, like the NUDM Spa, where manicures and haircuts are given in Norris during the weekend of NUDM. Other events take place to keep the rest of the campus involved while the dancers are busy, such as a DDR tournament and performances by on-campus groups.\n\nChicago's The Second City comedy troupe paid a visit in 1984. Since that time, popular bands and performers have been a highlight of the weekend of, including Northwestern alumnus Jay Sims, who has been DJing a portion of the event every year since 1996. NUDM has attracted the attention of celebrities such Barack Obama, George and Barbara Bush, Frank Sinatra, Jr., Adam Sandler, the cast of Modern Family, and NU alumni David Schwimmer, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert and Mike Greenberg. Chicago celebrities, like former mayor Jane Byrne and Chicago Bears players Mike Tomczak, Keith Van Horne and Trace Armstrong, have also danced.\n\nIn 2011, NUDM was named The Most Influential College Organization at the 2011 Stay Classy Awards after its record-breaking year.\n\n"}

He is a graduate of Green Templeton College, Oxford and an honorary fellow of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. In addition to his work in medicine and tropical diseases, he has published popular works in the fields of genetics and human prehistory. This latter work has been the subject of a number of television and film projects.\n\nOppenheimer trained in medicine at Oxford and London universities, qualifying in 1971. From 1972 he worked as a clinical paediatrician, mainly in Malaysia, Nepal and Papua New Guinea. He carried out and published clinical research in the areas of nutrition, infectious disease (including malaria), and genetics, focussing on the interactions between nutrition, genetics and infection, in particular iron nutrition, thalassaemia and malaria. From 1979 he moved into medical research and teaching, with positions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Oxford University, a research centre in Kilifi, Kenya, and the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang.\n\nHe spent three years undertaking fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, studying the effects of iron supplementation on susceptibility to infection. His fieldwork, published in the late 1980s, identified the role of genetic mutation in malarious areas as a result of natural selection due to its protective effect against malaria, and that different genotypes for alpha-thalassaemia traced different migrations out to the Pacific. Following that work, he concentrated on researching the use of unique genetic mutations as markers of ancient migrations.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994 Oppenheimer served as chairman and chief of clinical service in the Department of Paediatrics in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He worked as senior specialist paediatrician in Brunei from 1994 to 1996. He returned to England in 1997, writing the book \"Eden in the East: the drowned continent of Southeast Asia\", published in 1998. The book synthesised work across a range of disciplines, including oceanography, archaeology, linguistics, social anthropology and human genetics.\n\nHe continued to write books and articles, and began a second career as a researcher and popular-science writer on human prehistory. He worked as consultant on two television documentary series, \"The Real Eve\" (Discovery Channel) and \"Out of Eden\" (Channel 4), and published a second book, \"Out of Eden: the Peopling of the World\" (retitled \"The Real Eve\" in USA). This was followed in 2006 by \"The Origins of the British: a genetic detective story\", on the post-glacial peopling of Great Britain and Ireland. In 2009 he was consultant on the BBC TV series \"The Incredible Human Journey\".\n\n\nIn his book \"Eden in the East: The Drowned Continent of Southeast Asia\", published in 1998, Oppenheimer makes a case that the rise in ocean levels that accompanied the waning of the ice age—as much as —during the period 14,000–7,000 years ago, must be taken into account when trying to understand the flow of genes and culture in Eurasia. Citing evidence from geology, archaeology, genetics, linguistics, and folklore, he hypothesizes that the Southeast Asian subcontinent of Sundaland was home to a rich and original culture that was dispersed when Sundaland was mostly submerged and its population moved westward. According to Oppenheimer, Sundaland's culture may have reached India and Mesopotamia, becoming the root for the innovative cultures that developed in those areas. He also suggests that the Austronesian languages originate from Sundaland and that a Neolithic Revolution may have started there.\n\nIn 2002, Oppenheimer worked as consultant on a television documentary series, \"The Real Eve\", produced by the American cable TV network the Discovery Channel and directed by Andrew Piddington. The series was known as \"Where We Came From\" in the United Kingdom.\nThe \"Eve\" in the title refers to Mitochondrial Eve, a name used for the most recent common ancestor of all humans in the matrilineal (mother to daughter) line of descent.\n\nFollowing the series, Oppenheimer published a book on the same theme, originally titled \"Out of Eden\" in the UK and republished as \"The Real Eve\" in the US. This work, published in 2004, focuses on Oppenheimer's hypothesis: that approximately 85 thousand years ago, a group of modern humans migrated from East Africa across the Red Sea to South Asia in a single major exodus numbering no more than a few hundred individuals. This lone group of wanderers, he suggests, were the ancestors of all the peoples of the earth except sub-Saharan Africans, their descendants having since migrated all over the Eurasian continent, North Africa, the Pacific islands, and the New World, and radiated into a plurality of physical characteristics, languages, ethnicities and cultures as seen today.\n\nIn his 2006 book \"The Origins of the British\" (revised in 2007), Oppenheimer argued that neither Anglo-Saxons nor Celts had much impact on the genetics of the inhabitants of the British Isles, and that British ancestry mainly traces back to the Palaeolithic Iberian people, now represented best by Basques, instead. He also argued that the Scandinavian input has been underestimated. He published an introduction to his book in \"Prospect\" magazine and answered some of his critics in a further \"Prospect\" magazine article in June 2007.\n\nAlthough Basque-like Neolithic farmers did populate Britain (and much of Northern Europe) during the Neolithic period, upwards of 90% of their DNA was overturned by a North European population of ultimate Russian Steppe origin as part of an ongoing migration process that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to North and West Europe. Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as the British and Irish cluster genetically very closely with other North European populations, not Iberians, Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887932", "title": "Dog Fashion Disco", "text": "Dog Fashion Disco\n\nDog Fashion Disco is an American heavy metal band from Rockville, Maryland, United States, that was originally active from 1995 to 2007 before disbanding. The band officially reunited on October 10, 2013.\n\nCombining many different music styles (1960s psychedelic, jazz, piano recital, heavy metal, circus music and vocals, among others) Dog Fashion Disco is primarily considered an avant-garde metal and alternative metal band. The band's lyrical content is often highly esoteric and satirical, with constant tongue-in-cheek references to the occult, drug use, and mutilation. Their sound has often been compared to the Northern California genre-defying act, Mr. Bungle. The band members themselves have cited their collective influences as being Mike Patton (Mr. Bungle, Faith No More), Clutch, Tool, System of a Down and Frank Zappa.\n\nDog Fashion Disco, or \"DFD\" as many fans refer to them as, was formed in 1995 by Todd Smith, Greg Combs, and John Ensminger, who all went to high school together. Originally their name was \"Hug The Retard\", but this was changed name to Dog Fashion Disco before releasing any material, as they felt the name Hug The Retard was too offensive and might cost them fans. Their first two releases were self-released and low budget products. The first – \"Erotic Massage\" – was funded by a loan taken out by drummer John Ensminger, which his father had to co-sign on and \"took nearly a year of local shows to pay off the part of the loan that was used for studio time, printing and pressing\" and was released independently by the band in 1997. The second self-released album was titled \"Experiments In Alchemy\" and released in 1998. \"Experiments\" saw more heavy metal numbers, as opposed to the more ballady feel on many of \"Massage's\" songs. That same year, \"DFD\" signed with Outerloop Records and released \"The Embryo's in Bloom\". The studio quality of the album is noticeably better than its predecessors, and the band was very pleased with the resulted sound. It was then that their management by Maryland resident Derek J. Brewer began and lasted until they disbanded. Polkadot Cadaver is now also managed by Derek J. Brewer under Outerloop Management. In late 1998, Jeff Siegel would join the band as the keyboard player, replacing Sennen Quigley. This lineup would be the longest lasting lineup and stay intact for over 4 years.\n\nIn 2000, \"DFD\" played on USA Network's FarmClub. The exposure \"DFD\" received from the show lead them to signing with Spitfire Records.\n\nWith the release of their major label debut \"Anarchists of Good Taste\" in 2001 on Spitfire Records, \"DFD\" saw much wider popularity and distribution of their music than ever before, and recorded a track with System of a Down front-man, Serj Tankian providing vocals, \"Mushroom Cult\" on the \"Anarchists\" album. This song is often wrongly attributed to System of a Down, although Serj Tankian was the only member of System of a Down to perform on the track. The band shot their first music video for the song \"Leper Friend,\" and embarked on their first UK tour in support of the album. \"DFD\" also toured with the likes of Mindless Self Indulgence and Tub Ring through 2002.\n\nIn 2003, they released \"Committed to a Bright Future\" on Spitfire Records and supported Lacuna Coil on their first U.S. headlining tour. Although the album contains the same lineup as \"Anarchists\", both guitarist Greg Combs and drummer John Ensminger left the band before it was released, the latter being replaced by Mike \"Ollie\" Oliver before the album was released (and is pictured in the album booklet, as well as being listed as an official member of the band). Ensminger and Combs were credited as performing on the album, though not as band members. The spot of lead guitar was temporarily filled by Jason Stevens for the \"Committed\" tour, during which bassist and original member Stephen Mears left the band to join the Navy. Mears was replaced by Brian White, and after the tour, Stevens was replaced by Margret Heater member Jasan Stepp as lead guitarist. This lineup recorded the \"Day of the Dead EP\" and the live album \"The City Is Alive Tonight\", released in 2004 and 2005 respectively, and is the band lineup in \"DFDVD\".\n\nAfter a short period of off-time in the first half of 2005 (in which The Alter Boys sole album was made and released), Oliver quit the band. Shortly after, \"DFD's\" contract with Artemis was ended, and \"DFD\" were signed to Rotten Records. On April 4, 2006, they released their sixth studio album, \"Adultery\", which featured the return of original drummer John Ensminger. Their CD release party was held at Peabody's in Cleveland on the April 6th with Tub Ring. The band toured in support for the release of \"Adultery\" along with Tub Ring during the summer of 2006, in which keyboardist Tim Swanson temporarily replaced Jeff Siegel. Many of the shows took place in smaller venues (with subsequently smaller audiences) than their tours while signed to Spitfire and Artemis, and, according to Jasan Stepp, resulted in low morale among the band.\n\nOn December 5, 2006, Todd Smith Dog posted a blog entry on Dog Fashion Disco's official MySpace stating that the band had decided to call it quits. They performed their farewell show at the Sonar Lounge in Baltimore, Maryland on January 13, 2007 to a capacity crowd, with fans coming from as far away as the United Kingdom. The band played a marathon 25+ song set, ending with the crowd-favorite \"Albino Rhino\" from the 1998 \"Experiments in Alchemy\" album (this was a common concert-closer), and played the song \"Sweet Insanity\" from their newest album, \"Adultery\", for an encore song. Other past band members including Sennan Quigley and Mike \"Ollie\" Oliver attended to show support for their former musical family. The show was opened by the band Oddzar. The event was recorded and then released on the DVD \"DFDVD II\" by Rotten Records on October 28, 2008.\n\nOn April 17, 2007, a bulletin was posted on the Dog Fashion Disco MySpace page, announcing a new project, Polkadot Cadaver, which is stylistically similar to Dog Fashion Disco. The project features Todd Smith, Jasan Stepp and John Ensminger. The project's MySpace page has four songs and an album (\"Purgatory Dance Party\") which was released on the week of November 17, 2007 for pre-orders and had a street date of November 27, 2007.\n\nThey released their second album, \"Sex Offender\" on May 10, 2011. Their third album (and first on their own record label Razor to Wrist Records), titled \"Last Call in Jonestown\", was released on May 14, 2013.\n\nIn late 2008, Todd Smith and Jasan Stepp teamed up with members of Nothingface as well as Hellyeah to form Knives Out!. They released their debut album, \"Black Mass Hysteria\", on February 14, 2012. Their follow-up album, \"Left in the Lurch\", was released on August 19, 2016.\n\nIn 2010, Smith released his first solo album titled \"El-Creepo!\" under this moniker. He released his second album under the El-Creepo! name, entitled \"Aloha\", in 2012, and the third \"Bellissimo!\" on January 1, 2016.\n\nIn 2012, ex-guitarist Greg Combs's new band Celebrity Sex Scandal released their first single \"Ode to Katy Perry\". Their full-length debut, entitled \"Derivative\", was released in February 2013. In 2015 Celebrity Sex Scandal released their second album \"Integral\".\n\nTodd Smith, Matt Rippetoe and Jeff Siegel are members of The Alter Boys since 2005, although Todd Smith has stated that The Alter Boys will not release any new material.\n\nTim Swanson has since formed the band Ideamen. The band released an EP titled \"Progress\" in 2007 Their full-length debut studio album, \"May You Live in Interesting Times\", was released in 2009 on Rotten Records and their second full-length album \"Schemata\", was released in 2014. Matt Rippetoe released a solo record, \"BOINK\" in 2007, and formed a side project, Willamette, who released their self-titled debut in 2012.\n\nThe group reunited four times after breaking up before reforming as an active band again in 2013.\n\nThey first reunited on September 12, 2008 for the release of \"DFDVD II\" and their compilation \"Beating a Dead Horse to Death... Again\". The show featured Stephen Mears on bass for the first time in nearly 5 years.\n\nThe second reunion (and first with the final lineup) took place on April 17, 2010 at The Ottobar. The show was opened by Smith and Stepp's side projects Polkadot Cadaver and Knives Out!\n\nThey reunited once more on June 24 and 25 2011 for the tenth and fifth anniversary of their albums \"Anarchists of Good Taste\" and \"Adultery\", respectively. At the second show, Dog Fashion Disco announced that they will be releasing an acoustic album. Attendees of the reunion shows with VIP passes were provided with a code that allowed them to download an acoustic version of their song \"Sweet Insanity.\" it was also announced that the concert series are to be released on DVD sometime in the future. However, these DVD and acoustic plans have been postponed, and their fate is uncertain.\n\nThe most recent reunion was a two-night set of shows that took place on May 31 and June 1, 2013 at Baltimore Sound Stage, featuring the \"Adultery\" lineup like the previous two reunions. These Shows were preceded by an El-Creepo! \"warm up\" show at The Ottobar on May 30, which included drummers John Ensminger and Scott Radway, as well as Jasan Stepp. The first night of the reunion featured original guitarist Greg Combs on stage with \"DFD\" for the first time in over 10 years. At the second show, Smith announced plans for a new album, with the title \"Sweet Nothings\". On October 10, 2013, a status update via the Polkadot Cadaver Facebook page confirmed that Dog Fashion Disco is officially back together as a band. The line-up is the same as the previous three reunion line-ups, however, Tim Swanson will replace Jeff Siegel on keyboards once again. It was then announced that Mike Oliver would be playing drums on the summer tour of 2014.\n\nThe first album from \"DFD\" in eight years, \"Sweet Nothings\", was released on July 22, 2014 after being funded through Indiegogo. Due to the success from their Indiegogo campaign, in 2015 the band announced that they will be releasing a follow up album entitled 'Ad Nauseum'. They also announced three nights in London, England for September 2014, and the success of those sell-out dates prompted a UK tour with Psychostick in 2015. The album was released on October 2, 2015.\n\nThe band began releasing re-recorded versions of their earlier albums, in order to reclaim the rights to the music from their former record labels. The first of these was \"Erotic Massage\", which was released on May 19, 2017. This was followed up by another re-recorded album, \"Experiments in Embryos\", released on July 6, 2018. The third album, \"Anarchists of Good Taste\", was released in December 7, 2018 and the last of the re-records, \"Committed to a Bright Future\", was released on June 28, 2019.\n\n\"Moonlight City Drive,\" a novelization of DFD's 2006 concept album \"Adultery\" was written by Brian Paone and published in November, 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

However, in 1748, a male heir, William, was born to her parents, thus displacing her and putting her second in line to the position.\n\nPrincess Carolina's father died in 1751, making her three-year-old brother William V of Orange. At that point, her mother was appointed regent. However, in 1759, her mother died, and William V was still just ten years old. Then, Princess Carolina's paternal grandmother, Princess Marie-Luise, was made regent. Marie-Luise was regent until 1765, when she died. William V was now seventeen, but that was still not old enough to rule on his own. So, Princess Carolina was made regent. She ruled until 1766, when William V turned eighteen.\n\nShe died 6 May 1787 in Kirchheimbolanden, aged 44.\n\nOn 5 March 1760 in The Hague, during the regency of her grandmother Princess Marie Luise, Princess Carolina married Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg. They had fifteen children, seven of whom survived to adulthood:\n\n\n"}

It is found on the curved side of the cask, arranged so that when the cask is on its side and the keystone is at the lowest part of the rim, the shive will be the highest point of the cask.\n\nThe hole in that part of the cask is used for two purposes. Firstly, it is used for cleaning out and then refilling the cask, which requires a large hole. Once the cask arrives at its destination, the hole is used to control the amount of carbon dioxide present in the container, which requires a small hole. The shive is effectively an adaptor that reconciles these conflicting requirements. It is a wooden disk, larger than a keystone, that fits in the hole in the cask and has a smaller hole in its centre.\n\nFor washing and filling, the old shive is removed using a chisel or a special tool, revealing a hole around 3 inches (7.5 cm) across. Once the cask has been filled and fined, a new shive is hammered into place. The hole in the centre of the shive will be sealed with a small wooden or plastic peg. The cask is then transported to the pub.\n\nSome time before the beer is to be served (two or three days is common; especially strong beers may require more) the cask is opened or \"vented\". This entails breaking the seal in the middle of the shive by punching it through into the cask with a mallet and some kind of tool, usually just a hard spile.\nA spile is then placed in the hole to regulate the gas flow. If the beer is particularly \"lively\" (common in warm weather and with specific beers) the contents may spray out when the cask is vented.\n\nDuring use, the hole in the centre of the shive can also be used (with the spile removed) to insert a marked dipstick in order to measure the quantity of beer remaining.\n\nAs with keystones, it is considered good form to close up the hole in the shive when returning empty casks, both to prevent spillage and to reduce bacterial and fungal contamination.\n\nhttp://www.cellardoctor.co.uk/cellardoctor.html\n"}

{"id": "1887985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887985", "title": "Sprag clutch", "text": "Sprag clutch\n\nA sprag clutch is a one-way freewheel clutch. It resembles a roller bearing but, instead of cylindrical rollers, non-revolving asymmetric figure-eight shaped sprags, or other elements allowing single direction rotation, are used. When the unit rotates in one direction the rollers slip or free-wheel, but when a torque is applied in the opposite direction, the sprags tilt slightly, producing a wedging action and binding because of friction. The sprags are spring-loaded on their pivots to ensure that they lock with very little backlash once drive is engaged. \n\nA sprag clutch is used in some automatic transmissions as a method of allowing the transmission to smoothly change gears under load. Various models of General Motors' Turbo-Hydramatic transmission have used this system as well as many transmissions from Ford, such as the Ford C6 transmission.\n\nA sprag clutch is used in most older automatic transmissions and some newer ones for shifts which require the synchronized engagement of one clutch with the disengagement of another. Using an overrunning clutch instead of a hydraulically actuated one makes this synchronization automatic. The sprag clutch simply \"lets go\" once the reaction force it provides is no longer needed.\n\nIn a Simpson planetary gearset, common to many automatic transmissions, this happens on the 1-2 shift, and reverses on the 2-1 downshift. The 2-3 shift is done by engaging a single clutch, and nothing is released. Some newer electronically controlled transmissions make \"clutch to clutch\" shifts, without any sprags.\nThis can also be used exclusively in first gear (transmission shift lever in D, but auto valve body or management selecting 1st) on some autos. That way it will automatically provide forward drive, but will \"not\" provide any engine braking. This is done not so much to avoid engine braking per se, but rather to allow a low throttle opening 2-1 downshift as a car decelerates, to avoid a loud (and potentially abrupt) and unnerving jolt as a result of the downshift. On transmissions so equipped, manual selection of 1st gear typically engages an additional band that grips the same section as the one way clutch would engage, and thus allows for engine braking.\n\nA sprag clutch may be used in the starting turbine of a turbojet engine, so that the running main Engine does not keep the starter engaged at high speeds.\n\nA sprag clutch is used in many helicopter designs to transfer power from the engine to the main rotor. In the event of an engine failure, the sprag clutch allows the main rotor to continue rotating faster than the engines so that the helicopter can enter autorotation.\n\nA sprag clutch is used in the electric starter motors of modern motorcycle engines to replace the Bendix gear common to automobile starters.\n\nMany modern sport and racing motorcycles use sprag clutches in the primary drive between the engine and transmission. This prevents the rear wheel from losing traction during rapid downshifts when the engine speed is not matched to road speed. If a sprag clutch is not present, much greater care is required when downshifting, because losing rear wheel traction can cause dangerous highside accidents.\n\nOn conveyor drives, a sprag clutch is used for indexing and anti-runback.\nOverrunning occurs when two or more motors can be used to drive the same machine, including through the same shaft. A typical setup is as follows. The service drive, or prime mover, provides a combination of high speed and high power for normal operation. The secondary drive, or pony drive, can be run at low speed and low power, usually to position the conveyor for maintenance.\n\nThe overrunning clutch allows the secondary drive to remain stationary during normal high speed operation of the conveyor drive.\n\nAn indexing motion provides for accuracy in the drive system. A link is installed between the prime mover and one race of the sprag clutch. The reciprocating motion of the prime mover is converted to an indexing movement on the other race of the sprag clutch.\n\nBackstopping prevents a loaded inclined conveyor from running back when the drive system is stopped. The outer race of the sprag clutch is fixed to the machine frame, usually via a torque arm. The inner race rotates freely in the forward direction of the conveyor drive. When the machine tries to run backward, the sprag clutch prevents this motion. In this application the sprag clutch is often called a \"backstop\" or \"holdback\".\n\nA hoist load brake is used as a secondary brake to prevent industrial hoists from catastrophically dropping their loads in the event of mechanical failure.\n\nSprag clutches may be oil or grease lubricated. Most sprag clutch manufacturers don't allow the use of lubricants containing extreme pressure additives.\n\n"}

He is known for tough-guy and western roles, including the 1960 film \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), and producing several films for Sidney J. Furie such as \"Lady Sings the Blues\". He is also known for a short marriage to Peggy Lee, a friendship with Marilyn Monroe and for saving Frank Sinatra from drowning. Dexter's tough-guy roles contrasted with his easygoing and friendly real-life personality.\n\nDexter was born in Goldfield, Nevada, the second of three children (all males) born to Marko and Ljubica Šošo (later known as Marko and Violet Soso), who were ethnic Serb immigrants from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbian was Dexter's first language.\n\nThe family soon decamped for Los Angeles, where he attended Belmont High School. Tall, burly and handsome with bright blue eyes, Dexter was usually given supporting roles as a rugged character. After a stint as an amateur boxer, Dexter attended the Pasadena Playhouse, where he studied acting. He had a small role in \"The Mortal Storm\" (1940). During World War II he enlisted for military service with the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he met and befriended Karl Malden, a fellow Serbian-American, and appeared uncredited in the Corps play and film \"Winged Victory\" (1944).\n\nAfter the war, Dexter had a role in \"Heldorado\" (1946), a Roy Rogers western, as \"Barry Mitchell\". He was also credited under this name in \"Sinbad, the Sailor\" (1947). He appeared on Broadway in \"Magnolia Alley\" (1949).\n\nHe eventually changed his name to Brad Dexter and landed roles in \"The Asphalt Jungle\" (1950) and \"Fourteen Hours\" (1951). Dexter's breakthrough role was as a villain in RKO's \"The Las Vegas Story\" (1951), starring Victor Mature and Jane Russell. RKO cast him in a similar part in \"Macao\" (1952), also with Russell. RKO signed him to a contract. \n\nFrom January to November 1953, he was married to singer Peggy Lee. The union ended in divorce. She claimed that during their marriage he hardly worked. \n\nDexter was villainous to John Payne in \"99 River Street\" (1953). He then signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, for whom he made \"Untamed\" (1955), \"Violent Saturday\" (1955) for director Richard Fleischer, \"House of Bamboo\" (1955) for director Samuel Fuller, \"The Bottom of the Bottle\" (1956), and \"Between Heaven and Hell\" (1956) again with Fleischer.\n\nDexter was villainous to Joel McCrea in \"The Oklahoman\" (1957), produced by Walter Mirisch, and also appeared in \"Run Silent Run Deep\" (1958), again as a villain. He largely focused on television, however, appearing in episodes of \"Climax!\", \"The Gale Storm Show\", \"How to Marry a Millionaire\", \"Pursuit\", \"Studio One in Hollywood\", \"Wagon Train\", \"Have Gun - Will Travel\", \"Zane Grey Theatre\", \"Behind Closed Doors\", \"Cimarron City\", \"Yancy Derringer\", \"This Man Dawson\", \"77 Sunset Strip\", \"Colt 45\", \"The Man from Blackhawk\", \"Tightrope\", \"Mr. Lucky\", \"Bat Masterton\", and \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\", starring Steve McQueen. He made the occasional feature film, such as \"Last Train from Gun Hill\" (1959), directed by John Sturges, and \"Vice Raid\" (1959), and was second billed in \"13 Fighting Men\" (1960).\n\nDexter was then cast as a gunslinger in \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), directed by John Sturges for Walter Mirisch's production firm The Mirisch Company. Both Sturges and Mirisch had worked with Dexter before. It became his best-known role and most famous film. Characterizing him as a \"tough guy at his best in \"The Magnificent Seven\"\", Dexter's obituary in \"The Guardian\" singled out his portrayal of Harry Luck and claimed he was \"overshadowed\" by his contemporaries:A question that comes up regularly in film trivia quizzes is to name the Magnificent Seven of the 1960 John Sturges western. Easy to start with: Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Horst Buchholz. But if Brad Dexter... is usually the last to be mentioned, it is mainly because of the fame of the others; actually, he was rather good as the most mercenary of the septet. ... the cool and taciturn Harry Luck...\n\nThe success of \"The Magnificent Seven\" did not immediately benefit Dexter's career: he returned to television, guest starring in \"The Aquanauts\", \"Hawaiian Eye\", \"General Electric Theatre\", \"Tales of Wells Fargo\", \"Surfside 6\", \"The Investigators\", and \"Alcoa Premiere\". He could be seen in \"It Started in Tokyo\" (1961), \"The George Raft Story\" (1961) (playing Bugsy Siegel), \"X-15\" (1962) with Charles Bronson and \"Johnny Cool\" (1963). Dexter supported Yul Brynner again in \"Taras Bulba\" (1962), \"Kings of the Sun\" (1963) (from the producers of \"Magnificent Seven\"), and \"Invitation to a Gunfighter\" (1964).\n\nIn 1963, Dexter was cast as California Supreme Court Justice David S. Terry in \"A Gun Is Not a Gentleman\" on the syndicated anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Stanley Andrews. Carroll O'Connor portrayed U.S. Senator David C. Broderick of California, who mortally wounded Justice Terry in an 1859 duel. Though past allies in the Democratic Party, Terry, a slavery advocate, challenged the anti-slavery Broderick.\n\nDexter's friendship with Frank Sinatra began when Dexter saved Sinatra from drowning on May 10, 1964, during production of the World War II film \"None but the Brave\" (1965) on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. Sinatra and Ruth Koch, the wife of producer Howard Koch, were swimming when they were swept out to sea by the outgoing tide and nearly drowned. Sinatra's co-star Dexter and two surfers swam out and rescued them. Dexter was later awarded a Red Cross medal for his bravery. Grateful, Sinatra made him vice president of Sinatra Enterprises.\n\nAfter Dexter appeared in \"Bus Riley's Back in Town\" (1965), he made another film with Sinatra, \"Von Ryan's Express\" (1965). That year, Dexter complained that acting made him \"frustrated as hell. As an actor you don't have control over the medium you're in... you have no control over your destiny.\" \n\nDexter produced \"The Naked Runner\" (1967), which starred Sinatra and was filmed in London. Dexter and director Sidney J. Furie clashed with Sinatra over the latter's unwillingness to finish the film, and, after it was completed, Dexter resigned. \"I was the only guy who dropped Sinatra ... I couldn't put up with his nonsense\", Dexter said at the time. Publicly, Dexter denied any falling out with Sinatra. He claimed to have left Sinatra's company to make a film with Furie based on the Sam Sheppard case. \n\nThe project eventually became \"The Lawyer\" (1970) starring Barry Newman as Petrocelli. He produced two more films for Furie: \"Little Fauss and Big Halsy\" (1970) starring Robert Redford, and \"Lady Sings the Blues\" (1972) starring Diana Ross as Billie Holiday.\n\nDexter returned to acting with roles in \"Jory\" (1973), \"Shampoo\" (1975), \"Vigilante Force\" (1976), \"The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover\" (1977), \"House Calls\" (1978) and \"Winter Kills\" (1979), and guest parts on \"McCloud\", \"Kojak\", \"S.W.A.T.\", \"Project U.F.O.\", and \"The Incredible Hulk\". Dexter produced the TV series \"Skag\" (1980) starring Karl Malden. His last role was in \"Cognac\" (1988).\n\nHe was married to Star-Kist tuna heiress Mary Bogdanovich from January 27, 1971, until her death on June 12, 1994. Later in 1994, he married June Deyer and remained with her until his death.\n\nDexter died in Rancho Mirage, California, from emphysema, on December 11, 2002, at age 85, and is interred at Desert Memorial Park.\n"}

{"id": "1888003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888003", "title": "Thomas Doughty (explorer)", "text": "Thomas Doughty (explorer)\n\nThomas Doughty (1545 – 2 July 1578) was an English nobleman, soldier, scholar and personal secretary of Christopher Hatton. His association with Francis Drake, on a 1577 voyage to rob Spanish treasure fleets, ended in a shipboard trial for treason and witchcraft, and Doughty's execution.\n\nAlthough some scholars doubt the validity of the charges of treason, and question Drake's authority to try and execute Doughty, the incident set an important precedent: according to a history of the English Navy, titled \"To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World\" by Arthur L. Herman, Doughty's execution established the idea that a ship's captain was its absolute ruler, regardless of the rank or social class of its passengers.\n\nDoughty befriended Drake during Drake's military actions in Ireland. Drake, Doughty and John Wynter left Plymouth, England in 1577, purportedly on a simple trip to Alexandria. Drake's real mission was to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets in the New World; whether he proceeded with the full knowledge and sanction of Queen Elizabeth I, and whether his original intent was the circumnavigation of the globe are still topics of scholarly debate (see Kelsey, \"Sir Francis Drake: the Queen's Pirate.\") The three men apparently shared responsibility for the voyage but Drake soon assumed the role of commander of the expedition, a matter which caused friction between Drake and the aristocratic Doughty.\n\nDoughty was given command of a captured Portuguese ship, the \"Santa Maria\" (renamed \"Mary\"). The tension between Drake and Doughty worsened when Doughty caught Drake's brother, Thomas Drake, stealing from the captured cargo of the vessel. Drake assumed command of the \"Mary\" and reassigned Doughty to command his flagship the \"Pelican.\" During the long voyage across the Atlantic, Drake's hostility increased, fuelled by the rancor of his brother. Drake eventually demoted Doughty to command of a tiny supply vessel named \"Swan.\" This insult proved too much for Doughty to take, and he began to complain bitterly about \"the Captain General.\"\n\nWhen the \"Swan\" became separated from the rest of the fleet during a severe storm, Drake became convinced that Doughty was practising witchcraft. On 17 May 1578, upon the reunion of the fleet, Drake and Doughty had a final quarrel; Drake struck Doughty and ordered him tied to the mast. By 3 June both Doughty and his brother, John Doughty, had been put under house arrest and the sailors forbidden from interacting with them. Drake accused Doughty of being \"a conjurer and a seditious person,\" and his brother of being \"a witch and a poisoner.\"\n\nThe fleet arrived at Puerto San Julián, a natural harbour in Patagonia in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina on 20 June. Doughty's trial began on the 30th; Drake charged Doughty with not only mutiny, but treason. Doughty first appealed to be taken with the fleet as a prisoner and tried upon return to England, but Drake refused. Doughty next demanded that Drake show his commission from the Queen allowing him such jurisdiction, which Drake again refused, to which lawyer and friend of Doughty, Leonard Vicary, responded, \"This is not lawe nor agriable to justice.\" Drake responded, \"I have not...to do with you crafty lawyars, neythar care I for the lawe, but I know what I wyll do.\"\n\nThe main body of evidence against Doughty is referenced in manuscripts found in the British Library and compiled in William Sandys Wright Vaux's edition of \"The World Encompassed\", based on a log kept by Drake's chaplain, Francis Fletcher. This material contains a number of statements by Doughty that may have been made in the heat of anger. The statements could be interpreted as seditious, but would not be likely to be judged mutinous by a court of law (examined at length in Robinson and Hannay; the charges are reproduced in Vaux). There were two very damning pieces of evidence: the testimony of Edward Bright, the ship's carpenter, which, alone of the accusations, Doughty openly denied, and Doughty's own admission that he had disclosed the true purpose of their voyage to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, a staunch advocate of avoiding trouble with the Spanish. Drake painted the disclosure to Burghley as a betrayal of Queen Elizabeth; nevertheless, the jury of crewmen convicted Doughty of mutiny only, rejecting the charge of treason, and only after Drake prevaricated about whether he would seek Doughty's death.\n\nAfter obtaining the guilty verdict, Drake convened the jury and produced various documents from English nobility in support of Drake; he did not, however, produce a royal commission, which he claimed to have left on board his ship. Arguing that Doughty was a threat to his life and the expedition in general, Drake demanded execution. The men eventually agreed although some reluctantly; Drake then asked if there were any reasonable proposals of alternative solutions. Doughty himself suggested that he be set loose once the fleet reached Peru, but Drake refused, claiming that Doughty would alert the Spaniards to their mission. John Wynter volunteered to keep Doughty prisoner on his ship, \"Elizabeth,\" to which Drake initially agreed, but qualified the statement by saying that the ship would then have to return to England with no share of the treasure they would gain from attacking Spanish ships. Wynter was soon shouted down by his crewmen, and Doughty's fate was sealed.\n\nDoughty requested that he and Drake receive Communion together, and as reported by the contemporary account of Francis Fletcher, \"And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same table together, as cheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime, each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if some journey only had been in hand.\" On 2 July 1578, Thomas Doughty was beheaded. Shortly thereafter, Drake changed the name of his flagship from \"The Pelican\" to \"The Golden Hind\" purportedly to honour Christopher Hatton, whose crest was the hind, perhaps as an attempt to smooth over the Doughty incident.\n\nThe conditions of the case – the initial close friendship of the men, the unlikely amicability of Doughty upon his demise – have inspired numerous theories as to what may have truly transpired between Doughty and Drake. Drake's own family eventually perpetuated the rumour that Doughty had been intimate with Drake's wife, Mary. Other historians have speculated that Doughty had been a spy in the employ of Burghley throughout the voyage.\n\nAnalysis indicates, however, that not all of the men wished to be a part of what was swiftly becoming a pirate raid; John Wynter specifically spoke against it. Kelsey concludes that Drake wanted to set a stern example against indiscipline in the crew; his choice to hold Doughty's trial on the same spot where Ferdinand Magellan had executed his mutineers could hardly have been coincidental. Nevertheless, the rest of the circumnavigation was plagued by bouts of dissent. In January 1580, when Drake became stranded upon a reef off the Celebes Sea, the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher gave a sermon connecting their woes to the unjust demise of Doughty. For this action, Drake not only relieved Fletcher of his duties but chained him to a hatch cover and, despite his obvious lack of authority to do so, pronounced him excommunicated.\n\nThe Doughty incident continued to haunt Drake upon his return to England. There, John Doughty, brother of the deceased, sought legal recourse, but the action was dismissed on a technicality. There was also gossip about the inexplicable promotion of the carpenter, Edward Bright, to the position of master of the ship \"Marigold,\" which was inevitably read as payment for falsifying testimony against Doughty. Drake was never able to produce documents showing he had clear authority to act as he did. There was even a rumour, almost certainly false, that Drake was under hire by the Earl of Leicester to kill Doughty. According to the contemporary screed \"Leicester's Commonwealth\" (1584), Leicester desired Doughty's death because Doughty could incriminate him in the alleged murder of Walter Devereux, Earl of Essex. John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, refers to the Doughty incident in his poem \"Portsmouth's Looking Glass,\" as if it is a casual reference to judicial malfeasance that his readership will immediately recognise.\n\nDoughty's execution is the subject of Robert E. Howard's Solomon Kane poem, \".\"\n\nIn the episode of the 1960s UK children's TV series Sir Francis Drake 'The Doughty Plot', the story of how Doughty was tried and executed is recounted, though it is not historically accurate and makes Drake out as the hero.\n\nIn 1980, \"Drake's Venture\", a full costume drama of the key events was made for television, with John Thaw as Francis Drake and Paul Darrow as Thomas Doughty.\n\n"}

The text of the \"Rule of the Master\" is found in the \"Concordia Regularum\" of Benedict of Aniane, who gave it its name.\n\nThe \"Rule of the Master\" was written two or three decades before Benedict of Nursia's the Rule of Saint Benedict. Unlike the Rules of Pachomius which are a collection of regulations, instructions, and prohibitions concerning the life of the community, the \"Rule of the Master\" contains precise regulations but also a theological and spiritual reflection showing the reason for the regulations. The Rule of the Master consisted of an introduction followed by ninety-five chapters. Over twenty chapters are devoted to the Divine Office.\n\nThe four-part introduction comprises a prologue, the parable of the spring, the commentary on the Lord’s Prayer and the commentary on the Psalms. The format follows the literary convention of a series of questions. The first part, through Chapter 10, discusses spiritual doctrine, the latter portion, monastic discipline.\n\nIn the Parable of the Spring, the Master invokes Christ's appeal in Matthew 11:29 to \"Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart ...\" Adalbert de Vogüé points out that the Master viewed the monastery as a school where one learns from Christ. The first part of the Rule is characterized by the abbot's function to teach.\n\nOne of the writings that influenced the Master was Saint Augustine's \"Letter 211\", which was sent to a community of women founded by Augustine in the city of Hippo. Augustines's writings were well known in the West in the sixth century (though unknown in the East until several centuries later) and his texts on religious or monastic life were considered standard. The writings of John Cassian are also indicated.\n\nThe \"Regula Magistri\" is three times as long as Benedict's rule. It was possibly used by St Benedict as source material for his own \"Rule\". The structure of the Rules is similar, and there are parallel passages. However, Benedict did not simply copy the \"Regula Magistri\". He deleted some sections, and adapted others based on his own experience, placing more emphasis on fraternal love. Benedict's Rule demonstrates a more positive view of human nature than the Master. There is no historical record of the \"Regula Magistri\" having ever been used by any particular monastic community.\n\n\n"}

It was later expanded to 12 stories with a height of . The building was demolished in 1931. New York City then began building skyscrapers as Chicago had done, and the two cities were virtually the only cities in the world with huge skylines for many decades. Chicago has always played a prominent role in the development of skyscrapers and three past buildings have been the tallest building in the United States. Being the inventor of the skyscraper, Chicago went through a very early high-rise construction boom that lasted from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, during which 9 of the city's 100 tallest buildings were constructed. The city then went through an even larger building boom that has lasted from the early 1960s. The tallest buildings are concentrated in various downtown districts such as the Loop, Streeterville, River North, the South Loop, and the West Loop. Other high-rises extend north along the waterfront into North Side districts such as the Gold Coast, Lincoln Park, Lakeview, Uptown and Edgewater. Some high-rises also extend south from downtown along the waterfront to South Side districts such as Kenwood, Hyde Park, and South Shore.\n\nSeveral new skyscrapers were constructed in the city throughout the 2000s, including the Trump International Hotel and Tower. there were 67 skyscrapers under construction in Chicago.\n\nThis list ranks completed Chicago skyscrapers that stand at least tall, based on standard height measurement.

{"id": "1888028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888028", "title": "Comparison of Irish and Scottish Gaelic", "text": "Comparison of Irish and Scottish Gaelic\n\nAlthough Irish and Scottish Gaelic are closely related as Goidelic Celtic languages (or Gaelic languages), they are different in many ways. While most dialects are not immediately mutually comprehensible (although many individual words and phrases are), speakers of the two languages can rapidly develop mutual intelligibility.\n\nThe spoken dialects Irish and Scottish Gaelic are most similar to one another in Ulster and southwestern Scotland, regions of close geographical proximity to one another. It is thought that the currently extinct dialect of Galwegian Gaelic, spoken in Galloway in the far south of Scotland, was very similar to Ulster Irish and Manx.\n\nWhile the dialects of northern Scotland and southern Ireland tend to differ the most from one another in terms of vocabulary, they do share some features which are absent in other dialect areas lying between them. For example, in both Munster Irish and the Gaelic of the north of Scotland, historically short vowels have been diphthongised or lengthened before long sonants. An example of this is the word \"clann\" meaning \"children of the family\". In Munster Irish and northern Scottish Gaelic it is pronounced whereas in Ulster and County Mayo it is and in Connemara ; the Manx form \"cloan\" is in the north and in the south. Similarly, \"im\" meaning \"butter\" is pronounced in Munster, Southern Connacht and northern Scotland (and Manx), but in Ulster and Southern Scottish.\n\nIn addition, slender coronal stops ( and in Scottish Gaelic; and in Irish), are affricated (such as and ) in Mayo and Donegal, the southern Highlands and in Manx, but not in Munster or the northern Highlands.\n\nIn the verb \"tá\" of Standard Irish, northern Scotland and Central-Southern Munster agree in leniting the initial \"t\", thus one hears \"thá\" in County Waterford and County Tipperary, and \"tha\" in northern Scotland. West Munster also lenites the \"t\", but only after the preverb \"a\" \"that\" (\"an fear a thá ina sheasamh ag an ndoras\" \"the man that's standing at the door\", standard Irish \"an fear atá ina sheasamh ag an doras\", Scottish Gaelic \"am fear a tha na sheasamh aig an doras\").\n\nThe closest to Scottish Gaelic in modern Irish is the dialect currently spoken in County Donegal, as illustrated by the sentence \"How are you?\".\n\n\"Sibh\" is used in both Irish and Scottish Gaelic for the plural \"you\", while Scottish Gaelic [except for the far south] also uses \"sibh\" as a formal version of \"you\" (much like French uses \"vous\"; see \"T–V distinction\"). Modern Irish does not use this formal/informal distinction when addressing people. The use of \"sibh\" as 'polite' you is a retention from the Classical Irish usage of the plural personal pronouns to refer to the singular in polite communication, thus \"sinn\" \"we\" for \"mé\" \"I, me\" and \"sibh\" \"you (plural)\" for \"tú\" \"you/thou\". \"Thu\" is used in Scottish Gaelic when speaking to an individual friend, family member, or a younger person.\n\nThe negative particle in Scottish Gaelic, Manx and Northern Ulster Irish is \"cha/chan\" (\"chan eil\", \"cha bhfuil/chan fhuil\" = \"is not\"; \"chan\" is from the Old Irish emphatic negative nichon). In standard Irish the negative particle is \"ní\" (\"níl\" = \"is not\", a contraction of \"ní fhuil\"); \"ní\" is a retention of the normal Old Irish negative; these are illustrated by the sentence \"I have no money\":\n\nScottish Gaelic speakers may also sound as if they were using the Irish phrase, as \"Chan eil\" can frequently be shortened to \" 'n eil\".\n\nThe Classical Irish digraph \"éu\" is still used in Scottish Gaelic spelling but is now obsolete in Irish, except in southern dialect writing, as a means to distinguish the vowel \"é\" when followed by a broad consonant from the regular dialect development \"é\" to \"i\" in the same environment, thus \"éan\" \"bird\" in comparison to \"d'éug\" \"died; passed on\"). \"Éa\" is now used instead of \"eu\" in Standard Irish. Both \"éa\" and \"éu\" existed in Classical Irish, to a large extent showing nominal case differences (with \"éu\" varying with \"éo\" in the dative of \"éa\"-words), however in both Scotland and Ireland, spelling reforms and standardisation (which took place in Ireland under the auspices of the government of Ireland during the 20th century, and much earlier in Scotland) independently went for different versions.\n\nAt times Scottish writers used the spelling \"ia\" to represent how the combination is pronounced in northern dialects, writing \"ian\" instead of \"eun\", the southern form. Manx spelling, based mainly on English, shows that \"ia\" is also the underlying form in Manx, the word being spelled \"eean\".\n\nThe most obvious phonological difference between Irish and Scottish Gaelic is that the phenomenon of eclipsis in Irish is diachronic (i.e. the result of an historical word-final nasal that may or may not be present in modern Irish) but fully synchronic in Scottish Gaelic (i.e. it requires the actual presence of a word-final nasal except for a tiny set of frozen forms). Eclipsis is shown in the Irish orthography but not in Scottish Gaelic as it is conditioned by the actual environment.\n\nFor example, this means that phrases like Standard Irish , standard Scottish Gaelic , Manx is pronounced as follows in different parts of the Gaelic speaking world:\n\n\nAn example of diachronic-type eclipsis are the numbers:\n\nOne example of this in Scotland is the Gaelic \"joke\" of non-native speakers confusing \"the penis\" with \"the meeting/get-together\" (similar in sentiment to the English speakers' \"joke\" about non-native speakers confusing \"shit\" and \"sheet\")\n\nIn conservative speech, Scottish Gaelic feminine nouns also slenderise in the dative (prepositonal) case, giving , and so a different final consonant. This feature is uncommon today except in more formal registers and is ignored here.\n\nThere are a number of distinctive orthographical (written) differences. The spellings of both languages have been reformed in recent decades, which has led to further divergence, though conversely more recent spelling reforms in Scottish Gaelic have reduced the divergences to some extent.\n\nOne difference is that the accent is written as a grave accent (, \"heavy stroke/accent\") in Scottish Gaelic, as opposed to the acute accent (, \"length accent\" ( \"sharp stroke/accent\") used in Irish; hence the word for \"welcome\" is written as in Scottish Gaelic and in Irish as . Irish does not use the grave accent, while until recently Scottish Gaelic used the grave and acute accents to differentiate between open and closed vowel sounds. However, recent spelling reform has meant that only grave accents are now in Scottish Gaelic, leaving phonemic distinctions unmarked.\n\nAnother difference in Scottish Gaelic is that the aspirate linker is always hyphenated, while in Irish it is attached to the beginning of the word, as illustrated by the languages' respective names for each other:\nAdditionally, while the linkers and are usually hyphenated in both languages, in Irish they are attached to the beginning of words whose first letter is capitalised; in Scottish Gaelic they are always hyphenated.\n\nA number of letter combinations are possible in written Irish which are not found in Scottish Gaelic e.g. \"ae\", \"bhf\". Irish uses \"cht\" where Scottish Gaelic uses \"chd\", although \"chd\" itself was once common in written Irish, as was \"cht\" in Scottish Gaelic – both being used in Classical Gaelic. In the combinations \"sc\"/\"sg\" and \"st\"/\"sd\", Irish now uses \"sc\" and \"st\", while Scottish Gaelic uses \"sg\" and both \"sd\" and \"st\", despite there being no phonetic difference between the two languages.\n\nMost obvious differences in spelling result from the deletion of silent lenited digraphs (mainly \"dh\", \"gh\", and \"th\") in Irish in spelling reforms, which was only sometimes done in Scottish Gaelic. Overall, Scottish Gaelic orthography is more conservative than that of Irish.\n\nDifferences can also be seen in words used for geographical features. For example, \"hill\" and \"mountain\" are usually \"cnoc\" (\"Knocknapeasta\") and \"sliabh\" (\"Slieve Donard\") respectively in Ireland, but \"càrn\" (\"Cairn Gorm\") and \"beinn\" (\"Ben Nevis\") in Scotland. Additionally, \"inbhir,\" meaning \"river mouth\" and usually Anglicized as \"inver\" (for example \"Inverness\" or \"Inveraray\"), very common in Scotland, is almost never seen in Ireland.\n\n"}

Such an archive is called a solid archive. It is used natively in the 7z and RAR formats, as well as indirectly in <samp>tar</samp>-based formats such as <samp>.tar.gz</samp> and <samp>.tar.bz2</samp>. By contrast, the ZIP format is not solid because it stores separately compressed files (though solid compression can be emulated for small archives by combining the files into an uncompressed archive file and then compressing that archive file inside a second compressed ZIP file).\n\nCompressed file formats often feature both compression (storing the data in a small space) and archiving (storing multiple files and metadata in a single file). One can combine these in two natural ways:\n\n\nThe order matters (these operations do not commute), and the latter is solid compression.\n\nIn Unix, compression and archiving are traditionally separate operations, which allows one to understand this distinction:\n\n\nSolid compression allows for much better compression rates when all the files are similar, which is often the case if they are of the same file format. It can also be efficient when archiving a large number of small files.\n\nOn the other hand, getting a single file out of a solid archive requires processing all the files before it, so modifying solid archives could be slow and inconvenient. On newer formats such as 7-zip, there is a \"solid block size\" option that allows for the concatenated data block to be split into individually-compressed smaller blocks, so that only a limited amount of data in the block must be processed in order to extract one file. Parameters control the maximum solid block window size, the number of files in a block, and whether blocks are separated by file extension.\n\nAdditionally, if the archive becomes even slightly damaged, some of the data (sometimes even all data) after the damaged part in the block can be unusable (depending on the compression and archiving format), whereas in a non-solid archive format, usually only one file is unusable and the subsequent files can usually still be extracted.\n"}

It is the former home of the Great Alaska Shootout basketball tournament which has relocated to the Alaska Airlines Center as of 2014, and is the current home of the Alaska Fighting Championship mixed martial arts events. In 2007 it briefly became home to the Alaska Wild of the Indoor Football League which is now a defunct team. The arena opened in 1983 and sits just east of Mulcahy Stadium as part of the Chester Creek Sports Complex. Sullivan Arena hosted the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships along with the Harry J. McDonald Memorial Center in Eagle River.\n\nThe arena is named after former Anchorage mayor George M. Sullivan. It is owned by the Municipality of Anchorage and operated by SMG, a nationwide property management company.\n\nFor hockey, the Sullivan Arena offers 6,251 seats with a standing room capacity of 6,451. If areas designated for wheel chairs are included, the arena can seat 6,290, plus standing room, during hockey games. The arena is noted for having an international-dimension (Olympic-sized) ice rink (61 m × 30 m / 200 ft × 98.5 ft) instead of the NHL dimensions (200 ft × 85 ft / 61 m × 25.9 m) common among North American venues. The main arena floor contains 32,000 square feet of space.\n\nIn 2014, a new center-hung scoreboard, with four 8-by-8-foot video screens and a wraparound LED display system was installed to replace the 80s style scoreboard which had a black-and-white dot matrix display. The new scoreboard was previously installed at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California where it was used by the ECHL affiliate of the San Jose Sharks, the San Francisco Bulls. The Bulls purchased the scoreboard for their first season in 2012 but the team folded less than two years later. The scoreboard is made by Colosseo, a European company specializing in stadium and arena LED and entertainment technology.\n\nThere are currently plans, projected for 2015, for the neighboring Mulcahy Stadium to be demolished and rebuilt to its west in order to create 400 new parking spaces for the Arena. In addition, all seats and telescopic risers inside Sullivan Arena were replaced, the arena floor was rebuilt, and its ice-making equipment was upgraded for the 2015-16 hockey season. With the loss of the Aces, which leaves the Seawolves and WWE wrestling as sole tenants of the arena, another renovation in 2017 expanded the arena's storage space by 5,000 square feet, replaced the arena's portable stage, floor seating and artificial turf, and improved the arena's acoustics.\n\nMusicians that have played the Sullivan Arena are The Beach Boys in '83, Johnny Cash in '83, Eric Clapton (from the UK) in '85, Jimmy Buffett (from Key West) in '87, Bon Jovi in '89, Scorpions in '91, Ozzy Osbourne in 1992, Steve Miller Band (from San Francisco) in '93, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg in '94, Coolio in '96, Filter in '96, Metallica in '89, '92, '99 Aerosmith (from Boston) in '98, Green Day in '98, Stone Temple Pilots in '00, No Doubt in '00, Blink-182 in '01, James Brown in '01, Elton John in '08, Red Hot Chili Peppers in '13, Alaska's 36 Crazyfists in '15 for the Vans Warped Tour, Ontario's Sum 41 in '16, and Luke Bryan in '17.\n"}

He is known as a great reformer of the order.\n\nHe was born around 1109, although no exact date is recorded. The Obituary at Reims gives his death as 2 January 1169. He was the youngest of a family of boys, the children of Lord Godfrey de Blanchefort of Guyenne. He trained in combat from a young age, but during his time as Grand Master, placed more emphasis on reform and negotiation. This helped to foster the Templars image as guardians, not brutes.\n\nHis earliest action as Grand Master was with Baldwin III of Jerusalem, with whom he fought against Nur ad-Din Zangi. However, he was taken prisoner after King Baldwin was defeated at Banyas in 1157. The defeat allowed an ambush to be set for Blanchefort, who had dismissed his Frankish soldiers after battle ceased. He was held in captivity for three years in Aleppo before being released to Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus when the emperor made peace with Nur ad-Din.\n\nBertrand accompanied King Amalric I during the expedition against Egypt in 1163. The expedition ended in failure, despite the considerable numbers the Christians could draw upon. Bertrand refused to participate in a second expedition in 1168, as heavy losses were almost certain. He was succeeded by Philip of Milly.\n\nBlanchefort petitioned the Pope to use the title, \"Master by Grace of God\", which fitted the Templar's position as rising stars in the church, a favor which Rome gladly granted. His internal reforms were more important however. He wrote the \"Retraits\", which established structure within the order. This meant knights had clearer roles and protocols. He also established checks within the leaderships of the order, which stopped future Grand Masters deciding the direction of the Templars, without the backing of the knights.\nHis work on creating negotiating roles within the order is also worth noting. After the failed expedition to Egypt, it was the Templars that helped draw up a peace treaty.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards it has erroneously been asserted that Bertrand de Blanchefort was related to a family of the same name located near Rennes-le-Château This erroneous assertion was first discredited in France in 1984.\n"}

In American cuisine, the term is mostly used to refer to a light sauce for beef recipes, which may be served with the food or placed on the side for dipping.\n\nIn order to prepare a natural \"jus\", the cook may simply skim off the fat from the juices left after cooking and bring the remaining meat stock and water to a boil. \"Jus\" can be frozen for six months or longer, but the flavor may suffer after this time.\n\nIn American recipes \"au jus\" often use soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, white or brown sugar, garlic, beets, carrots, onions, or other ingredients to make something more like a gravy. The American \"jus\" is sometimes prepared separately, rather than being produced naturally by the food being cooked. An example could be a beef \"jus\" made by reducing beef stock to a concentrated form, (also known as \"Glace de Viande\") to accompany a meat dish. It is typically served with the French dip sandwich.\n\n\"Jus\" can also be made by extracting the juice from the original meat and combining it with another liquid e.g. red wine (thus forming a red wine \"jus\").\n\nA powdered product described as \"jus\" is also sold, and is rubbed into the meat before cooking or added afterwards. Powdered forms generally use a combination of salt, dried onion, and sometimes sugar as primary flavoring agents.\n\nIn the United States, the phrase \"au jus\" is fairly often used as a noun, owing to its having been corrupted in culinary references into the noun form: rather than a \"sandwich au jus\", the menu may read \"sandwich with au jus\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1888046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888046", "title": "Bojangles' Coliseum", "text": "Bojangles' Coliseum\n\nBojangles' Coliseum (originally Charlotte Coliseum and formerly Independence Arena and Cricket Arena) is an 8,600-seat multi-purpose arena located in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is operated by the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, which also oversees nearby Ovens Auditorium and the uptown Charlotte Convention Center. The naming-rights sponsor is Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits. The building's signature domed roof is made of tin instead of steel or iron. The dome spans 332 feet in diameter and rises to 112 feet tall.\n\nConstruction began on the Coliseum in 1953 after some delays. Gouldie Odell served as project designer; this represented his first major project and he would later found Odell and Associates, Inc. James C. Hemphill, Jr. oversaw the project. In September 1955 the building was opened and dedicated by Billy Graham as the Charlotte Coliseum. At the time, it was the largest unsupported dome in the world and the first free-spanning dome in the United States. Numerous newspapers and architectural magazines ran stories about the building over the following years, especially its dome. Total evacuation time for the entire structure was just four minutes, while seating capacity could be anywhere between 10,000 and 14,000 seats, approximately, depending on the event.\n\nThe Coliseum hosted numerous acts and events over its first few decades. A Billy Graham Crusade took place at the Coliseum in 1958. Elvis Presley had his first performance at the Coliseum in 1956 and his final one in 1977, being one of numerous musical acts to perform at the Coliseum during this time. In 1958, a massive storm went through the region, damaging the Coliseum's roof. However, the roof held up despite the damage. In 1970, a new north entrance was added. Due to its location, visitors walked onto the building's upper concourse after purchasing their tickets. This entrance is still used today.\n\nAfter the new Charlotte Coliseum opened in 1988, the original Coliseum was shuttered since the new building effectively took over all the original Coliseum's duties. However, people soon realized the original Coliseum was nowhere near the end of its useful life. Over the next five years, an extensive refurbishment was made to the structure. This included technology, infrastructure, and accessibility upgrades.\n\nOnce reopened in 1993, it was considered as an alternate to the larger Coliseum for events that required less seating or overall space. An expansion franchise in the East Coast Hockey League, the Charlotte Checkers (named in honor of the original Checkers team that played at the Coliseum from 1956 to 1977), became the building's primary tenant. It also got its first name change that same year to Independence Arena. Color TVs were installed inside the concourse and a small restaurant opened for select fans in 1995. In 2001, the arena was renamed Cricket Arena in a naming rights arrangement with Cricket Communications.\n\nIn 2005, the Checkers departed Cricket Arena for the newly opened Spectrum Center (then known as Charlotte Bobcats Arena, but it would change to Time Warner Cable Arena). Due to this, the Coliseum was left without a permanent tenant for a decade. The building remained open as a venue for medium-sized concerts and stage shows which wouldn't be suitable for the Spectrum, as well as high school and some college sporting events, along with local attractions. In 2008, Bojangles Restaurants, Inc., based in Charlotte, bought the naming rights.\n\nQuestions about the building's future would arise in the years that followed, due to its age and lack of events. In 2012, the city of Charlotte began considering renovating the building itself as a multi-use sports complex. Two years later, another plan was announced with developer GoodSports that would add both a hotel and sports complex next to the Coliseum. Both plans ultimately fell through.\n\nIn November 2014, the arena got a permanent tenant once again when a third Checkers franchise, now in the American Hockey League, announced a tentative agreement with the Charlotte Regional Visitors' Authority to return to Bojangles' Coliseum for the 2015–16 season. This franchise had taken the place of the ECHL Checkers four years earlier. The agreement was pending a Charlotte City Council vote to approve $16 million in funding for renovations in conjunction with the Checkers' return and that December, the city approved the $16 million needed. The renovations would include many modern amenities. This would be the Coliseum's first major renovation since the 1988 refurbishment.\nAlmost a year to the day when the Checkers announced their return to the Coliseum the renovations were completed and unveiled to the public. Aside from the new seats and score/video boards, other additions also included a sound system (replacing the one used since 1955), locker rooms, a restaurant, updated concessions and repainting the interior.\n\nThe Coliseum celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2015. Additional renovations were made in 2016, including upgraded heating/cooling, new internal lighting, and replacing the ice floor among other improvements. In 2018, the city of Charlotte broke ground on a structure that will connect the Coliseum to Ovens Auditorium. Construction is expected to be completed by 2019.\n\nDuring its days as the Charlotte Coliseum the arena was one of the homes for the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association from 1969 through 1974. The Cougars became tenants after the Houston Mavericks moved to North Carolina in 1969. The Cougars were a \"regional franchise\", playing home games in Charlotte (Bojangles' Coliseum), Greensboro (Greensboro Coliseum), Winston-Salem Memorial Coliseum and Raleigh (Dorton Arena). Hall of Fame Coach Larry Brown began his coaching career with the Cougars in 1972. Billy Cunningham was the ABA MVP for the Cougars in the 1972-73 season. Despite a strong fan base the Cougars were sold and moved to St. Louis in 1974.\n\nThe arena hosted the ACC men's basketball tournament from 1968 to 1970, the Southern Conference men's basketball tournament from 1964 to 1971 (and again in 2010 for the tournament's first three days), and was the site of the Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournament from 1977 through 1980. Overall, the Coliseum has held no fewer than 15 tournaments between the three conferences and has also hosted 13 NCAA Tournaments. The Coliseum hosted the Charlotte 49ers basketball teams from 1976 until 1988, and again from 1993 until 1996. In 2017, the first two rounds of the CIAA men's and women's basketball tournaments were played at the Coliseum. This marked the 29th college tournament played at the building.\n\nBefore the third iteration of the Checkers (AHL) returned in 2015, Bojangles' was the home of minor league hockey for many years prior. The first instance started in 1956, when the Baltimore Clippers moved to Charlotte to become the first iteration of the Checkers. The building hosted its first hockey match in January 1956 before a sold-out crowd of over 10,000. The club lasted until 1977, when they folded. In 1993, the ECHL version of the Checkers started and won a championship in 1996. The second iteration of the Checkers played at the Coliseum until 2005, with the franchise surrendering its licence to the ECHL when the Carolina Hurricanes moved their AHL franchise from Albany (NY) in 2010, creating the third iteration. The Coliseum would have been available to host playoff games in either the ECHL or AHL during the following decade (due to possible scheduling conflicts with Spectrum), but this never occurred as the Bobcats (as the NBA team was called) never made the playoffs during the time (the current Charlotte NBA franchise, which began in 2004, has never won a playoff series).\n\n\nThe Carolina Speed of the American Indoor Football Association, formerly playing at the Cabarrus Arena & Events Center, moved to the Coliseum in 2009. After the season, they announced they would be sitting out the 2010 season and resuming play in 2011 back in Cabarrus. They returned in 2011 to the Coliseum, this time as a member of the Southern Indoor Football League, and remained until 2013.\n\nThe arena also hosted the worst team in MILL history, the 1996 Charlotte Cobras (0–10). The 1996 season was their one and only in the MILL and the team folded without ever winning a game. In 2012, the arena was home to the Charlotte Copperheads of the now defunct Professional Lacrosse League.\n\nA soccer team, the Carolina Fighting Vipers, played their one and only season in the CISL in summer 1994. The team went 3–25 and then went \"inactive\" for 1995, never to return. The Fighting Vipers averaged 3,034 fans per game in their one season.\n\nThe Coliseum hosted both NWA Wrestling and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling from the 1970s to the 1990s. WCW also held numerous wrestling events there, including the tenth anniversary of Starrcade, the company's premier event of the year, and the 1997 Slamboree. Additionally, the building hosted on March 31, 2010. An episode of AEW Dynamite was broadcast live from the venue on November 6, 2019.\n\nThe Charlotte Roller Girls roller derby league played their home bouts at the arena from 2008 to 2009 before moving to the Grady Cole Center.\n\nBojangles' Coliseum has been the site for numerous concerts, shows, and various events throughout its lifespan. \nIt has been the site for the Spring Commencement ceremonies of Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU) for several years. JCSU uses the Coliseum because it offers more seating and parking capacity than their own on-campus facilities. The Coliseum also hosted the graduation ceremony for the Charlotte campus of the University of Phoenix. In addition, the UNC-Charlotte, Central Piedmont Community College and many local high schools have held and currently hold graduation ceremonies at the building. Donald Trump held a rally at the coliseum on March 2, 2020.\n\n"}

TECO Energy was the first company to obtain the naming rights to the building, changing the name to TECO Arena. In 2004, TECO Energy decided they were no longer interested in holding the naming rights. Germain Motor Company bought the rights, and in 2004 the venue was renamed to Germain Arena. This same company, an automobile dealership with locations in Florida, Arkansas, and Ohio, also held the naming rights to the Germain Amphitheater in Columbus, Ohio. In September 2018, The Hertz Corporation, an Estero-based company, bought the naming rights for the arena and it was renamed Hertz Arena on October 1. The company is also petitioning the city to repaint the arena bright yellow with black accents to match their branding. In August of 2019, the Hoffmann family entered into an agreement to purchase both the arena and sports team as part of their plan to expand the entertainment segment in SWFL. Hoffmann Commercial Real Estate is the largest individual property owner in Naples.\n\nThe arena has been used as a multipurpose venue, primarily hosting the Florida Everblades ECHL ice hockey team and the Florida Tarpons indoor football team. It was also the home for the Florida Flame NBA Development League team and the Florida Firecats Arena Football League 2 (af2) team.

As of 2009 the Cibao has a population of 5,622,378 making it the most populous region in the country.\n\nThe word Cibao, ; , means \"place where rocks abound\". Cibao was a native name for the island, although the Spanish used it during the Spanish conquest to refer to the rich and fertile valley between the Central and Septentrional mountain ranges.\n\nEl Cibao occupies the central and northern part of the Dominican territory. To the north and east of the region lies the Atlantic Ocean; to its west lies the Republic of Haiti and to the south the Central Range, which separates El Cibao from the other natural regions.\n\nThe Cordillera Central mountain range is located within El Cibao, containing the highest peak in all of the Caribbean, Pico Duarte. Two of the largest rivers of the country are also located inside this region: the Yaque del Norte, the largest river of the Dominican Republic, and the Yuna river. Both of these rivers contain several chains of dams used to provide the region with water for irrigation (since agriculture is the main activity of the area) and hydroelectric energy. Rice, coffee and cacao are the most important crops grown in the area.\n\nThe central mountain range also has important mining activity. Its main mineral resources include gold, iron and nickel, among others. The largest gold mine in the Americas and second largest in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine, is located in the Cibao region. The internationally known Barrick Gold and Falconbridge are the companies in charge of the extraction of these ores.\n\nThe valley is not only a geographical unit, but also a cultural and linguistic unit. The Cibao region is considered to be the cultural heartland of the Dominican Republic. The typical accent spoken in the Cibao region is a mixture of two dialects: that of the 16th- and 17th-century Portuguese colonists in the Cibao valley, and of the 18th-century Canarian settlers.\n\nMerengue music, played using the güira, tambora and accordion, was originated in El Cibao. The original folk type of merengue is known as \"perico ripiao\" or \"típico\", which is played to this day by local musical groups, as a variation of the merengue, with a faster pace.\n\nDuring Late January and through February, several carnivals are held within the region. The most popular of these festivals belongs to the province of La Vega, and dates back to the first European settlements. It began as a religious activity celebrating the pre-Lent season, and the carnival's theme revolves around the victory of good over evil.\n\nMany important Dominican patriots were of Cibaeño origin. Among the most important are local generals José Desiderio Valverde and José Antonio Salcedo, who were responsible for the restoration of the Republic in the later decades of the 1800s. During the Trujillo dictatorship, the Mirabal sisters arranged clandestine organizations to rebel against the fascist dictatorship. The sisters were brutally murdered in 1960, and remain today as some of the biggest martyrs on behalf of the Dominican nation.\n\nThe bulk of the population is mainly concentrated in the center of the region. The city of Santiago de los Caballeros constitutes the regional center and main focus of development of the area.\n"}
{"id": "1888060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888060", "title": "Moroccan riad", "text": "Moroccan riad\n\nA riad (; also spelled \"riyad\") is a type of traditional Moroccan or Moorish interior garden or courtyard associated with house and palace architecture. The term is nowadays often used in Morocco to refer to a hotel or guest house-style accommodation with shared common areas and private rooms, often within a restored traditional mansion.\n\nThe term \"riad\" originates from the Arabic term for garden, (\"riyad\"). Historically, the term referred to a common but specific type of interior garden: one that is symmetrically divided into four parts along its central axes and typically has a fountain at its middle. \n\nRiad architecture ultimately has ancient roots in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern domestic architecture. Houses centered around inner courtyards existed across the ancient Greco-Roman world and, before that, in the ancient Middle East. Interior gardens are also an ancient feature of domestic architecture in the Middle East, and the geometrically arranged gardens of Islamic architecture derive from Iranian civilization in particular. Archaeological remains of similar gardens have been found in and around ancient Mesopotamia, and the evolution of such gardens can be found in the grand geometrically-arranged gardens of later Iranian and Indian architecture, known as \"chahar bagh\".\n\nIn addition to the existing influences of Greco-Roman culture in the Mediterranean, the formation of the Islamic world after the 7th century also spread and established these architectural models across the region and all the way to al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula. The ancient Roman city of Volubilis also provided reference for the beginnings of riad architecture during the Idrisid Dynasty in Morocco. Interior gardens were a popular feature of palace architecture in the Islamic world because water and greenery were associated with images of paradise in Islam. Prominent examples in al-Andalus (Spain under Muslim rule) were found at Madinat al-Zahra, the Aljaferia, and the Alhambra. When the Almoravids conquered al-Andalus in the 11th century they sent Muslim, Christian and Jewish artisans from al-Andalus to Morocco to work on monuments. The earliest known example of a true riad garden (with a symmetrical four-part division) in Morocco was found in the Almoravid palace built by Ali ibn Yusuf in Marrakesh in the early 12th century. The era of the Almoravids and their successor dynasties (such as the Almohads, the Marinids, and the Nasrids) was a formative period of Moroccan architecture and of wider Moorish architecture during which the model of the riad garden was perfected and established as a standard feature of interior secular or palace architecture in the region. It was particularly successful and common in Marrakesh, where the combination of climate and available space made it well-suited to the architecture of the bourgeois mansions and royal palaces built throughout the city's history.\n\nThe riad is one of the main types of a traditional Moroccan house, often with two or more stories around an Andalusian-style courtyard that centered around a fountain. Riads were the stately city homes of the wealthiest citizens such as merchants and courtiers. In many cases, especially for palaces, the gardens were surrounded by a gallery. Moroccan houses were inward focused, which allowed for family privacy and protection from the weather. This inward focus was expressed with a centrally placed interior garden or courtyard, and the lack of large windows on the exterior walls of rammed earth or mud brick. This design principle also found support in the social mores of Islamic society, which placed great value on privacy and encouraged a separation between private family spaces (where women lived and worked) and semi-public spaces where outside guests were received. The central gardens of traditional riads wre often planted with fruit trees such as orange trees or lemon trees. The walls of the riads could be adorned with tadelakt plaster, stucco decoration, and zellige tiles, sometimes with Arabic calligraphy and quotes from the Quran.\n\nThe style of these riads has changed over the years, but the basic form is still used in designs today. Recently there has been a surge in interest in this kind of house with a wave of renovation in towns such as Marrakech and Essaouira, where many of these often-crumbling buildings have been restored to their former glory as hotels or restaurants. Many of the crumbling or ruined properties in Marrakech have been bought by foreigners. This foreign interest has brought new challenges but the investment has helped with the restoration of the UNESCO site and has helped revive many of the handcrafts and artisan trades that were gradually being lost before this trend. Many of the restored riads in the districts of Mouassine and Lakssour offer the finest examples of restoration as historically these areas contained many of the grand palaces from Marrakech's Saadian period.\n\n"}
{"id": "1888061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888061", "title": "Spile", "text": "Spile\n\nA spile is a small wooden or metal peg used to control the flow of air into, and carbon dioxide out of, a cask of ale. Spiles can also be used to broach water from trees.\n\nCask ale is dispensed without the addition of externally supplied gas. That it is served \"flat\" with no bubbles at all, though, is a misconception. Properly conditioned cask ale will have enough dissolved carbon dioxide to produce bubbles of carbon dioxide. This has been generated by the natural action of the yeast living in the beer while it is stored and transported. In fact, the yeast can produce more carbon dioxide than is required, and it is for this reason that the cask is vented through the hole in the shive.\n\nWhen it is first delivered to the place where beer will be poured from it or where it will be connected to the beer engine, the cask is sealed. It has a keystone (where the tap will be driven in) and a shive (through which it was it was filled). Once it has been laid down in the location at which the beer is going to be dispensed, a venting punch is used to pierce the shive, which is either partially pre-drilled or has a hardwood tutt sealing the completely drilled hole. This breaks the seal, and the tap can then be driven into the keystone – if it is hammered in when there is still a high internal pressure, it can be blown out again, with embarrassing consequences.\n\nTo allow the loss of excess gas, soft spiles, made of open-grained softwood, bamboo, or harder wood with cuts in, are used. Once the cellarman judges this process to be complete, a hard spile is inserted which does not allow any more gas out. These are made of harder wood (usually still technically \"softwood\", but denser and more solid than soft spiles). When beer is being drawn from the cast this is removed and can be replaced by a soft spile, or left open. When no beer is being dispensed a hard spile is put back in. Plastic spiles are also available..\n\nOnce the spile is reinserted, enough gas will be generated by the yeast to replace the volume of gas that will have come out of solution. But the amount of carbon dioxide that can be produced is limited, so a hard spile is kept in as much as possible. This is one of the reasons for real ale's short shelf-life once a cask is opened – if too much carbon dioxide is lost, the beer will become flat. Typically, the beer will be good only for two to four days; this short shelf life is why it is important that a pub serving real ale have sufficient turnover for casks to be emptied while still at their best.\n\nLike many such older terms, the word spile has other local meanings. For example:\n\nA spile is utilized to obtain water in the novel \"Catching Fire\" and subsequent film \"\".\nThe spile consists of a tube with one end sharpened and the other split. When pounded into a tree, a stream of fresh water flows from the tube. Most of the year, this is not consistent with the nature of trees, as water diffuses upward through very tiny capillary passages. When a tree is cut down, water does not flow out of the cut surface. The technique used in the movie would only work in early spring or late winter, when the watery sap runs high in the trees.\n\nThe taps that are placed in maple trees are placed into drilled holes and the resultant fluid is sap, not water.\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, and Boston Red Sox. Although Hayes was considered one of the best catchers in the American League in the late 1930s and early 1940s, he played for an Athletics team that routinely finished in last place. A six-time All-Star, he holds the major league record of most consecutive games played by a catcher.\n\nBorn and raised in Jamesburg, New Jersey, Hayes was nicknamed \"Blimp\", even though he was listed at and . He first caught the attention of an umpire who then recommended him to Connie Mack, the owner and manager of the Philadelphia Athletics.\n\nHayes made his major league debut with the Athletics on September 21, 1933, at the age of 18, making him the youngest player in the league at the time. He was hitless in five at bats that season.\n\nAfter the Athletics' regular catcher, Charlie Berry, suffered an injury in 1934, Hayes took his place and set a major league record for most games caught in a season by a teenager when he appeared in 92 games as a nineteen-year-old. In September , Hayes joined a group of American baseball players led by Connie Mack in a barnstorming tour of Japan when Charlie Berry, who had originally been selected to go, was struck with appendicitis. Among the baseball players who joined Hayes in Japan were Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Charlie Gehringer. He was sent to the minor leagues in , where he played for the Buffalo Bisons and the Albany Senators of the International League.\n\nHayes returned to the major leagues in , replacing Paul Richards as the Athletics starting catcher, a position he held for six seasons. On July 25, 1936, he tied a major league record by hitting 4 doubles in a game against the Cleveland Indians. In 1939, Hayes earned his first All-Star selection when he was named as a reserve behind Bill Dickey on the American League team in the 1939 All-Star Game. He ended the year with a .283 batting average along with career-highs of 20 home runs and 83 runs batted in. His batting average improved in 1940, when he posted a .308 batting average with 16 home runs and 70 runs batted in. Hayes' on-base percentage also improved from .348 in 1939 to .389, and was once again named as a reserve player for the American League team in the 1940 All-Star Game. He had another respectable season in 1941, hitting for a .280 average along with 12 home runs and 63 runs batted in, and for the third consecutive year, was named to as a reserve player for the American League in the 1941 All-Star Game. Despite his contributions, the Athletics finished in last place for the second consecutive season.\n\nIn January 1942, Hayes had a knee operation which delayed his appearance at spring training and consequently caused him to gain weight. This setback along with the impressive performance by his replacement, Hal Wagner, made Hayes dispensable and on June 1, 1942, he was traded to the St. Louis Browns for Bob Harris and Bob Swift. After hitting for only a .188 batting average in 1943, it appeared as if his baseball career might be at an end when Connie Mack brought him back to the Athletics in a trade for Sam Zoldak in February 1944. Back in Philadelphia, his career was rejuvenated, producing a career-high 144 hits in 581 at bats, for a .248 batting average, with 13 home runs, 18 doubles, 6 triples and led the Athletics with 78 runs batted in while batting as their cleanup hitter. Hayes caught every one of the Athletics' 155 games and led American League catchers in games played, putouts, assists, and in baserunners caught stealing. He was also named to the American League All-Star team for the fourth time in his career and, ranked 14th in the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting.\n\nAlthough Hayes was rated as one of the top catchers in Major League Baseball, he had a reputation for being temperamental and, this may have played a role in Mack's decision to trade him to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Buddy Rosar in May 1945. Contemporary news reports expressed astonishment over the trade, as Hayes was considered one of the best catchers in the league while Rosar was refusing to play for the Indians due to a salary dispute. Hayes immediately assumed the starting catcher's role for the Indians, leading American League catchers with 145 games played and a .988 fielding percentage. He was selected to be a reserve catcher for the American League in the 1945 All-Star Game however, the game was cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions.\n\nFrom October 2, 1943, to April 21, 1946, Hayes caught 312 consecutive games, a record for major league catchers that has never been broken. Hayes was the Indians catcher on April 30, , when Bob Feller threw a no hitter and, he provided the only run of the game with a ninth-inning home run.\n\nIn the middle of the season while mired in a hitting slump, Hayes had a falling out with Indians' manager Lou Boudreau over being benched in favor of Sherm Lollar. Five days after starting for the American League in the 1946 All-Star game, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox. He was released by the White Sox after the 1946 season then, signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent. He was given his unconditional release by the Red Sox on May 17, 1947, at the age of 32.\n\nIn a fourteen-year major league career, Hayes played in 1,364 games, accumulating 1,164 hits in 4,493 at bats for a .259 career batting average along with 119 home runs, 585 runs batted in and a .343 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .977 fielding percentage. He compiled 30 career stolen bases along with 213 doubles and 32 triples. During his career, he was named to six All-Star teams. He led the American League three times in total chances per game, twice each in putouts, double plays, and once each in assists and fielding percentage as a catcher. When he caught 155 games in 1944, he set a still-standing American League record for games played in a season as catcher. His accomplishment of 312 consecutive games caught remains an unbroken major league record. Hayes' 29 double plays in 1945 is the second-highest season total ever for a catcher, behind Steve O'Neill's record of 36, set in 1916.\n\nHayes operated a sporting goods store in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, after his playing career. He died at the age of 40 in Point Pleasant in , eight years after retiring as a professional baseball player. His family declined to reveal the cause of his death. However, TheDeadBallEra.com lists it as retroperitoneal hemorrhage in the site's \"Too Young to Die\" entries for 1955.\n\n"}

The arena serves as the home of the Greenville Swamp Rabbits of the ECHL.\n\nThe Bon Secours Wellness Arena was built in 1998 at a cost of US $63 million, under its former name of BI-LO Center, to replace Greenville's outdated and under-repaired Greenville Memorial Auditorium, which was imploded on September 20, 1997 on a site located across the street from the new arena. The arena naming rights were purchased by Dutch grocer Ahold, then-owner of BI-LO, which had been founded in nearby Mauldin and was still based there at the time. When it was built, it passed Columbia's Carolina Coliseum as the largest arena in the state of South Carolina, a distinction it held until 2002, when the Carolina Center was built in Columbia.\n\nOn September 18, 2013, the BI-LO Center was officially renamed the Bon Secours Wellness Arena after the Bon Secours Health System purchased the naming rights.\n\nAs a concert venue, the Bon Secours Wellness Arena can seat approximately 19,000 spectators, depending on the positioning of the stage. In addition, the arena features 30 luxury suites and 840 club seats.\n\nCurrently, the Bon Secours Wellness Arena regularly hosts a wide variety of events such as professional wrestling, monster truck rallies, ice dancing shows and competitions, and concerts spanning many different musical genres.\n\nDuring an average year, The Well hosts 20–25 concerts spanning across all music genres and related artists. Notable concerts include The Eagles, Garth Brooks, Luke Bryan, Pearl Jam, Eric Church, Bon Jovi, and many more.\n\nThe Bi-Lo Center opened with Janet Jackson in 1998 and followed in the same year with Pearl Jam, and later, Rob Zombie with Korn; Jay-Z in 1999; Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Creed, Red Hot Chili Peppers with Foo Fighters, Ricky Martin, NSYNC, Limp Bizkit with Godsmack, Eminem with DMX (who once lived in Greenville) in 2000; Fuel with Buckcherry, Dave Matthews Band in 2001; and Puddle of Mudd, and Tool in 2002.

These perennial favorites form the foundation of strong annual programming.\n\nThe arena has served as the home of multiple professional and semi-professional teams. From 2001–2003, the arena served as the home for the Greenville Groove, one of the original members of the National Basketball Development League. It also hosted the Carolina Rhinos football team, one of the inaugural members of AF2, from 2000–2002. Beginning in 1998, the arena hosted the Greenville Grrrowl, an ECHL team. Despite having won the Kelly Cup in 2002, the Greenville Grrrowl folded in 2006. On February 14, 2010 the ECHL team the Johnstown Chiefs announced that it would be moving from Johnstown, PA to Greenville, SC following the 2010 season.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1990 who represented the eastern Toronto riding of Scarborough East. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. From 1969 to 1984 he served as a municipal politician in the city of Scarborough, Toronto.\n\nFulton attended the R.H. King Academy in Scarborough.\n\nHe served as an alderman in the city of Scarborough (now part of Toronto) from 1969 to 1984, and was a city controller from 1984 to 1985. He also served on the Metro Toronto Council from 1981 to 1982 and from 1984 to 1985. He served as chair of the Waterfront Advisory Board during his time on the Metro Council.\n\nHe was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating his Progressive Conservative opponent by 4,610 votes. The Liberal Party formed a minority government after this election, and Fulton was appointed to cabinet on June 26, 1985, as Minister of Transportation and Communications.\n\nEasily returned in the 1987 election, Fulton remained in cabinet in the restructured portfolio of Ministry of Transportation. In June 1989, Fulton was implicated in the Patti Starr affair. Starr, who was head of the National Council of Jewish Women, misused her position by having the organization make political contributions to the riding associations of prominent Liberal MPPs. Fulton's riding of Scarborough East was among those who received an illegal contribution. On August 2, when Peterson shuffled his cabinet in the wake of the scandal, Fulton was not included.\n\nThe Liberals were defeated in the 1990 provincial election, and Fulton lost his seat by 1,774 votes to Bob Frankford of the Ontario New Democratic Party. The Liberal Party asked him to run again in the 1995 election, but he declined the offer in order to spend more time on his consulting business.\n"}
{"id": "1888083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888083", "title": "North Charleston Coliseum", "text": "North Charleston Coliseum\n\nThe North Charleston Coliseum is a 14,000-seat multi-purpose arena in North Charleston, South Carolina. It is part of the North Charleston Convention Center Complex, which also includes a Performing Arts Center, and is owned by the City of North Charleston and managed by SMG. The Coliseum was built in 1993 (the Performing Arts Center and Convention Center opened in 1999), and is located on the access road to the Charleston International Airport.\n\nThe Coliseum is home to the ECHL's South Carolina Stingrays professional ice hockey team and serves as an alternate home for the Charleston Southern University basketball team. It is the area's primary venue for concerts and other major indoor events expected to draw large crowds. The Coliseum is currently undergoing an expansion project intended to increase concourse space, provide additional points of sale, and create venues for banquets, receptions, and other smaller-scale events. The arena contains 9,875 permanent seats, including 7,175 in the upper deck, and 1,646 riser seats.\n\nThe Coliseum is the current home of the South Carolina Stingrays, a minor league professional ice hockey team that plays in the ECHL. When construction first began on the arena there were no plans to include ice-making equipment. However, after an ECHL franchise application for the city of North Charleston had been pre-approved by the league in April 1992, the city council approved the funds required for the installation of an ice surface into the building that was already well under construction. The Stingrays began play there for the 1993–94 ECHL season.\n\nIt is the alternate home arena for the Charleston Southern University basketball team. Typically, Charleston Southern University uses the Coliseum for non-conference games that draw audiences greater than their home arena's 798-seat capacity, such as cross-town rivals College of Charleston and The Citadel. Furthermore, its size allows them to play major conference teams such as Virginia Tech at home (some major conference arenas do not seat 10,000). In addition, the North Charleston Coliseum has hosted the Big South Conference (1993–94) and the Southern Conference basketball tournaments.\n\nThe Coliseum has previously hosted arena and indoor football teams, as well as a National Basketball Development League team, as well as an all female production of Ben Hur that drew several noise and indecency complaints.\n\nIn addition to sporting events, the arena hosts concerts, comedy shows and various other events. The Coliseum has served as the venue for several televised events, to include pay-per-view after the Florence Civic Center's infrastructure failed (1996), WCW Uncensored (1997), Shania Twain (2004), WWE Raw (2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015), PBR Built Ford Tough Series (2006), \"Wheel of Fortune\" (2006), and \"American Idol\" (2007, 2011) and \"The X Factor\" (2013) auditions.\n\nOther major concerts and events have included KISS playing their final show with the original lineup (2000), Oprah Winfrey (2006), Walking with Dinosaurs (2008), a CNN Presidential Debate (2012), a Fox Business Presidential Debate (2016), Kid Rock (2008, 2011), Taylor Swift (2009), The Dave Matthews Band (in 1996, and since 2005), Kenny Chesney (2011), Jay-Z (2013), Brad Paisley (2011, 2014), Prince (2011). and Trans-Siberian Orchestra's winter concerts and Beethoven's Last Night shows (2004-2012).\nThe Coliseum hosted Metallica in '93 Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, Columbia's Hootie & the Blowfish with Greenville's Edwin McCain in '95, Gainesville's Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in '95, Athens GA's R.E.M. in '95, Green Day in '95, Macon GA's Allman Brothers Band in '96, Pearl Jam in '96, Stone Temple Pilots in '97, Jay-Z in '99, and N'SYNC in 2000. The Beach Boys performed at the North Charleston Performing Arts Center in 2018 for their Reason for the Season Tour.\n\nPlanning for the coliseum began in 1985, when a city-sponsored study determined that the city could support a venue seating 10,000-plus people. In October of that year, the McNair Realty and Development company of Greenville, South Carolina, who owned the Centre Pointe development tract, donated of that land valued at approximately $100,000 an acre to the city for construction of the coliseum. The coliseum was originally planned to be part of a redevelopment dubbed \"City Center,\" which was to include the coliseum, a convention center, a performing arts center, a transportation hub, a library, an art gallery and museum, an arts school, parking garages, and scenic park areas, and was to have been completed by 2000. As of June 2011, only the coliseum, convention center, and performing arts center have been completed.\n\nIn September 1988, the city considered five architectural firms for design and supervision of the coliseum's construction, eventually settling on Odell Associates, Inc. City Council approved a $25 million budget for design and construction of the coliseum and by February 1991 accepted a $19.8 million bid for the construction contract by McDevitt and Street Co. of Charlotte, North Carolina. Construction began on April 29, 1991, with an estimated completion time of 20 months. In September 1992, the City Council approved $879,000 to fund installation of an ice rink in the coliseum, which at that time was scheduled for completion by December 26 of that year. The ECHL Board of Governors met in November 1992 to vote on bringing a hockey franchise (whose application had been pre-approved that April) to the Charleston area. At that meeting, the league approved creation of the expansion franchise for the 1993–94 ECHL season, giving the coliseum its first professional sports team as a tenant.\n\nThe coliseum opened its doors on January 29, 1993 to a capacity crowd with its first event, the World Cup Figure Skating Champions ice skating exhibition. The opening night was plagued by parking issues that resulted in traffic congestion on local roads and up to an hour delay in clearing the parking lots following the show. The following night saw another sellout crowd for a concert featuring country music star Alan Jackson, for which the traffic problems were reduced due to early arrivals and improved traffic direction. The city expedited the expansion of available parking spaces from 4,000 to 5,030 soon after.\n\nOn November 10, 1997, the 5-ton coliseum scoreboard dropped while it was being lowered, landing on and killing Billie Wayne Garrett, a rodeo volunteer from Columbia. Coliseum officials believed the issue was with the board's hoisting mechanism, which was manufactured by a New Jersey company that had recently experienced hoist failures in two of its mechanisms, one resulting in a scoreboard dropping to the floor. The fall also caused a crack in the coliseum floor, but it was repaired and no damage was found to have been done to the piping system that makes ice for the coliseum floor. Garrett's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company that manufactured the scoreboard, the company that had recently inspected and passed the scoreboard, and Ogden Entertainment, the coliseum's managing company. The lawsuit was settled for $3.5 million. An upgraded scoreboard featuring improved video panels and a safer hoisting setup was installed in October 1999. This scoreboard was replaced in 2012 by another video scoreboard, part of a $21 million renovation that saw the addition of two food courts, the largest of which is the Montague Terrace, as well as a new ticket office and upgrades to eight luxury suites.\n\nIn August 2000, Ogden Entertainment—which had managed the coliseum since its opening in 1993—was purchased by Aramark. Aramark urged city officials to transfer management of the coliseum to SMG, of which Aramark was a half owner at the time, in an effort to leverage SMG's entertainment industry connections to bring more concerts to the area. In an effort to bolster attendance at the coliseum, which had been operating at a loss for two years, SMG took over management of the coliseum in late 2001, agreeing to construct a large freestanding marquee visible from Interstate 526 as part of the management contract.\n\nAn ambitious expansion project was approved for financing by the city of North Charleston in 2009. The expansion consists of extensions built onto the Coliseum's north and south entrances, increasing concourse space by and adding up to 40 additional points of sale for concessions. The expansion will allow for renovation of existing suites and upgrades to the Coliseum's sound system, spotlights, and rigging bridges. Construction on the south side extension, dubbed Montague Terrace, commenced in August 2010 with a planned completion date of October 2011. Construction of the north side extension was completed in 2012.\n\n\n"}

A common form of radiculitis is sciatica – radicular pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve from the lower spine to the lower back, gluteal muscles, back of the upper thigh, calf, and foot as often secondary to nerve root irritation from a spinal disc herniation or from osteophytes in the lumbar region of the spine. Radiculitis indicates inflammation of the spinal nerve root, which may lead to pain in that nerve's distribution without weakness as opposed to radiculopathy. When the radiating pain is associated with numbness or weakness, the diagnosis is radiculopathy if the lesion is at the nerve root and myelopathy if at the spinal cord itself.\n\n"}

{"id": "1888114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888114", "title": "NBC Talknet", "text": "NBC Talknet\n\nNBC Talknet was a nighttime programming block on the NBC Radio Network from the 1980s to the 1990s. It comprised several advice-oriented call-in talk shows, the most notable personalities being Bruce Williams and Sally Jessy Raphael. At a time when talk radio was a mostly local format, Talknet, among similar services, brought the format to a national level.\n\nPrior to the late 1970s, AM radio was still largely dominated by all-music formats. Many individual radio stations had introduced some talk programming to their lineups, but it was almost universally locally produced. The concept of national talk radio, broadcast over a radio network, had not been tried. In 1978, Larry King began broadcasting six hours of talk programming nightly on the Mutual Broadcasting System. His success in the field proved to radio programmers that there was an audience for both late-night talk programming and national talk radio programming. NBC and ABC were quick to enter the late-night talk radio market. ABC launched a nightly block of programming called TalkRadio and NBC launched Talknet.\n\nAt the time when Talknet was introduced, the Fairness Doctrine was still in place, requiring radio and television stations, among other things, to give equal time to both sides of controversial issues presented on the air. As a result, most radio stations avoided opinion programming and instead opted for call-in shows such as those featured on Talknet that were advice-oriented, with listeners calling in to ask questions and receive help with various issues and problems in their lives.\n\nTalknet premiered on 21 stations nationwide on Monday November 2, 1981. Early affiliates included WRC Washington, WIOD Miami, KXL Portland, WJW Cleveland, KFBK Sacramento, WLW Cincinnati, KOB Albuquerque, WDAY Fargo, WOOD Grand Rapids, and WSTV Steubenville, OH. Maurice Tunick was creator and executive producer. \n\nTunick: \"I came up with the name 'Talknet' and created and developed the 'Dear Abby' format for Sally Jessy Raphael which I tested earlier that year on NBC's WRC in Washington D.C. Prior to Talknet the only radio advice shows were hosted by clinical psychologists. My idea for Sally was 'a friend.' Over the back fence advice. Someone to talk to, someone who cares (as the theme music said). A daring, revolutionary idea at the time. Sally was a well traveled but unknown broadcaster at the time. Sally's TV show would start a couple of years later (1983) - a direct result of her Talknet success.\"\n\"Much forgotten is that Bruce Williams originally aired at 10PM Eastern to Midnight, and Sally Jessy Raphael aired Midnight to 3AM Eastern time. That quickly changed, I'm not sure how long - maybe a couple of months - to 7-10PM and 10-1AM. The shows were a hit out of the box and stations asked for an earlier feed time. Weekend programming was added a year later with Bernard Meltzer and Dr. Harvey Ruben.\" Bruce Williams answered questions from listeners on issues related to money, personal finance, investments, business and other similar topics.\n\nOn December 5, 1982 Williams crashed while attempting to land his airplane in Princeton, New Jersey. Tunick: \"He was critically injured and nearly clinically dead when he arrived at the Medical Center of Princeton. One week later Bruce was back on the air from his hospital room and did his show from there for a week before he was released and originated his program from home for the next three months. We were told at the time this was the first national radio show to originate from a hospital.\" (Williams later said he was in a coma for 20 days following the crash, making his return to radio more like a month after the crash.)\n\nSally Jessy Raphael hosted the 10 pm-1 am time slot and spoke to callers about issues involving relationships and their personal lives. Her radio show was recently revived in 2006.\n\nWilliams was a tentpole of the Talknet lineup and continued with the service until its demise. Raphael, however, remained as host for a total of six years, from 1981-1987. Following her departure, several other hosts filled the 10 pm-1 am slot, dispensing personal and relationship advice. These included Myrna Lamb, Lee Mirabal, Dara Welles and Neil Myers.\n\nBruce Williams retired from broadcasting on March 29, 2013.\n\nTunick: \"I left Talknet in late 1985 after being recruited by ABC Radio where I became Vice-President of Programming for the ABC Talkradio Network. I stayed close to Sally during the next year, knowing she had one year remaining on her contract. In late 1986, the radio world was shocked to learn Sally Jessy Raphael was jumping to ABC Radio. I also hired the legendary Tom Snyder to make Sally (7-10) and Tom (10-1) the new bookends of nighttime listening.\"\n\nIn 1986, NBC, along with its parent company, RCA, was purchased by General Electric. GE absorbed RCA primarily to acquire the NBC television network, and shortly thereafter sold the rest of the corporation's various other divisions. The NBC radio4 network was sold to Westwood One. NBC radio continued as a programming service through 1989. After that date, the NBC brand name continued to be used on some programming, but NBC radio no longer existed as a separate programming service. Westwood One continued the \"Talknet\" programming through the mid-1990s, but eventually dropped the \"Talknet\" name as well as the 10 pm-1 am personal advice programming. The time slot is currently held by Jim Bohannon, a carryover from the now retired Mutual Broadcasting System (which was acquired by Westwood One in 1985).\n\nBruce Williams remained with Westwood One hosting his own individual program from 7 pm-10 pm for some years more, but eventually moved to the Talk America Radio Network (then owned by IDT) on June 25, 2001, and later Business Talk Radio Network until 2008. From 2008 to 2010, the self syndicated the show, which included a relay on the Sirius-XM channel also called \"America's Talk\" as well as on the Cable Radio Network. \n\nRaphael focused her efforts on television, but after her TV show was canceled, relaunched her show as \"Sally JR's Open House\", originally an Internet-only effort, but later transferred to radio syndication. Raphael's last radio show aired July 7, 2008.\n\n"}

Martha was diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly after he was born. As a teenager, Stojanovich became an avid photographer, saving his money to buy an expensive Hasselblad camera and getting his own darkroom in his father's barn in Campbell, California. He won the respect of Graham Nash, an avid photographer, at the age of 13 and began to collaborate with him. At 16, he dropped out of high school and started taking film-making classes from Larry Booth in Half Moon Bay, California. His experience as a photographer made the transition to motion pictures relatively easy. .\n\nHis interest in policing began when he was attending high school in San Jose, often listening to his police scanner. He even subscribed to a CHP magazine. In 1973, at 17, Paul met San Jose Police Officer Nate Jaeger who allowed him to ride along with him on Patrol weekly. Paul turned from still photography to Super 8 camera filming of Nate's police assignments and calls. In 1973 Paul produced his first 16mm short film called \"Two Bits\" in black and white starring Nate Jaeger. Nate retired from the police department, after signing a film and recording contract, and moved to Beverly Hills, California. Nate initiated the first free Rock n' Roll music site on the Internet and completed his book \"...and the rest was Rock n' Roll...\" Paul combined his interest in photography and film-making and his interest in police work when Nate convinced some friends with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office Narcotics unit to let him film their work. The film became the Emmy-award winning documentary \"Narco\".\n\nStojanovich then spent a few years working as a cameraman for then NBC affiliate KRON. While working at KRON, he met one of his heroes, photographer Ansel Adams, who was particularly interested in the workings of his video camera. He also worked as a field producer for the ABC news magazine \"20/20\" and was creative consultant on Oliver Stone's film \"Natural Born Killers\".\n\nAfter serving as a field producer for the reality show \"COPS\" in 1989 and then producing and creating the ABC series \"American Detective\", Stojanovich executive produced a series of crime reality shows, including \"World's Scariest Police Chases\" and \"Ultimate Police Challenge\". His legacy as an innovative creator and producer still commands respect in the entertainment business.\n\nThe Beaverton, Oregon Police Department made Stojanovich an Honorary Special Reserve Officer.\n\nStojanovich died on March 15, 2003 after accidentally falling off a cliff on the Oregon coast while posing for a photograph his fiance, Kim Crowell, was taking.

Manuel Barrueco began playing the guitar at the age of eight, and he attended the Esteban Salas Conservatory in his native Cuba. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1967 as political refugees. His first recordings aroused excitement about his skills and musical interpretation. Ever since, Barrueco has toured extensively, appearing in some of the world's most important musical centers, including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, London, Munich, Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Rome, Copenhagen, Athens, South Korea, Taipei, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan.\n\nBarrueco has made well over a dozen recordings for EMI, including his 2006 album, \"¡Cuba!\", which was called \"an extraordinary musical achievement\" by the San Francisco Chronicle, while his recording of Joaquín Rodrigo's \"Concierto de Aranjuez\" with conductor/tenor Plácido Domingo and the Philharmonia Orchestra, was mentioned as the best recording of that piece in \"Classic CD Magazine\". His \"Nylon & Steel\", is a collection of duos with guitar greats: Al Di Meola, Steve Morse (Deep Purple), and Andy Summers (The Police), further demonstrating Barrueco's outstanding versatility and imaginative programming.

With 98 affiliated stations across the United States, including flagship WBLS in New York, the network broadcast an hourly five-minute newscast at 50 minutes past the hour. It also aired sports and feature programs, and for one year beginning in the spring of 1974, a 15-minute daily soap opera called \"Sounds Of The City\". Some of its special programming focused on African American history, much of which was researched, written and narrated by MBN news anchor Ben Frazier.\n\nProgramming is what separated the Mutual Black Network from the rest of the pack. But its highest mark was made in the coverage of hard news and its savvy advocacy style of journalism. This was a genre of journalism, practiced by news anchors Ben Frazier, Glen Ford, John Askew and others. They would interview black news-makers who had largely been ignored by most traditional mass media outlets, including Mutual's main network. Thanks to the Mutual Black Network, those news-makers, their agenda, dreams and anger would finally make it to the forefront of the American body politic. Their sound bites made it to the air and to a new level of relevancy because of the Mutual Black Network's hourly newscasts. Tape editors James Barber and Gregory S. Kearse provided the bulk of sound bites for the hourly newscasts. Kearse produced the Soul of Entertainment hosted by legendary newsman Ed Castleberry and interviewed stars such as Gladys Knight, Glynn Turman and the Pointer sisters. Kearse began as a weekend tape editor in 1974 while completing his B.A. degree in English, and left MBN to pursue a career in book publishing at Howard University Press in 1978.\n\nIn 1981, the Mutual Black Network was purchased by Sheridan Broadcasting, an African American-owned company which had been a minority stockholder in MBN, and renamed the Sheridan Broadcasting Network. A decade later, SBN merged with the rival National Black Network, forming the present-day American Urban Radio Networks.\n"}

{"id": "1888147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888147", "title": "Origins of the papal tiara", "text": "Origins of the papal tiara\n\nThe origins of the Papal Tiara remain somewhat nebulous and clouded in mystery, first appearing in the Early Middle Ages, but developing a recognizable form in the High Middle Ages, after the Great Schism of 1054. The word \"tiara\" itself occurs in the classical annals to denote a Persian headdress, particularly that of the \"great king.\" A \"camelaucum\" which was similar in shape to papal tiaras, was part of court dress in Byzantium; it was also inspired by the Phrygian cap, or \"frigium\". Given that other rituals associated with the Papal Coronation, notably the use of the sedia gestatoria, were copied from Byzantine and eastern imperial ceremonial, it is likely that the tiara is also of Byzantine origin.\n\nA form of papal crown is first mentioned in the \"vita\" of Pope Constantine (8th century) contained in the \"Liber Pontificalis\"; there it is called a \"camelaucum\", a folded cap of white linen that was part of Byzantine court dress. A contemporary depiction of Gregory the Great (died 604) shows such a cap. Coins of Pope Sergius III (904-11) and Pope Benedict VII (974-983) depict these popes wearing such a helmet-like-cap augmented at the base with a single coronet-like fillet.\nIt subsequently was mentioned in the supposed Donation of Constantine which is a forgery embedded among the forged Decretals in the early 9th century:\n\nPopes since ancient times had worn some sort of head covering. By the 9th century it would appear that this took the form of a helmet-shaped white head-cap. Pope Gregory the Great (r. 590-604) is shown in contemporary artwork wearing such a headpiece. When exactly it developed its first lower tiara is unclear, though the \"Catholic Encyclopaedia\" speculates that it was in or around the 10th century, perhaps to distinguish the ceremonial papal head covering from the ecclesiastical one, the Mitre, which appeared around this era. The first explicit mention of the word \"tiara\" associated with the papacy appears in the account of the life of Pope Paschal II (r1099-1118) in the \"Liber Pontificalis\". \nA decorated \"circlet\" or ornamental band which may be the origins of the first tier of the tiara, is shown on coins of Pope Sergius III (r. 904-911) and Pope Benedict VII (r. 974-983)\n\nPope Nicholas I is thought to have been the first to unite the princely crown with the white headcovering. However the common belief that Pope Boniface VIII (r. 1294-1303) around 1300 added the second crown, is disputed. While an inventory of the papal treasures in 1295 suggests that the tiara had at that stage only one tier, Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) is represented wearing a two tiered crown in a painting that predates Boniface. \nWhat is certain, from statues of Boniface made during his lifetime and which he saw (and so did not dispute the accuracy of), is that he wore a two-tiered tiara, so the two-tiered tiara originated no later than his reign. Two of these statues of Pope Boniface are in the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica. Why the second tiara was added is not formally stated in any documents, but historians such as James-Charles Noonan suggest that it may have been symbolic of growing papal claims to both temporal and spiritual power, the two tiers in the papal crown contrasting with the single tier of standard monarchical crowns.\n\nThe first notice of three crowns appears in an inventory of the papal treasures of the year 1315 or 1316. An effigy of Pope Benedict XII, which is on display in Avignon shows him wearing a three-tiered tiara. \n\nThe lappets (two decorated strips of cloth which hang at the back of a tiara) are shown in paintings from the 13th century but may well have existed before then.\n\nA fresco in the Chapel of Saint Sylvester (consecrated in 1247) in the church of the Santi Quattro Coronati in Rome seems to represent the Pope wearing a tiara with two bands and with lappets.\n\nConstructing a certain chronology for the evolution of the three tiers on the papal tiara is problematical, given the lack of definitive records and conflicting evidence in contemporary artistic representation of popes. While it is certain that the three tiers had been introduced by the 14th century as late as the 15th century some representations were still appearing in art which showed the existence of a single-tiered tiara.\n\n"}

He is best known as the lead singer for the Serbian and Yugoslav rock band Riblja Čorba. Renowned for his brand of poetic lyrics and husky baritone voice, Đorđević is widely considered as one of the top and most influential authors of the Serbian and Yugoslav rock scene.\n\nĐorđević was born in Čačak in 1952 to machinist father Dragoljub and mother Nerandža, professor of Serbian. \n\nAt age thirteen, he formed his first band, Hermelini (trans. \"The Ermines\"), with Borko Ilić (lead guitar), Prvoslav Savić (rhythm guitar), and Aca Dimitrijević (drums). Đorđević played bass guitar and the band's sound was influenced by the Zagreb-based beat band Roboti. \n\nTwo years later Đorđević switched to rhythm guitar and began writing lyrics/poetry. One of his earliest songs/poems, \"Moje tuge\", would later be recorded and released on Suncokret's debut single \"Kara Mustafa\" / \"Moje tuge\" as well as included on their debut album \"Moje bube\". After Hermelini, Đorđević played with numerous Čačak-based bands: Vesnici Ljubavi, Safiri, Dečaci sa Morave, and Čačanski Plemići. For a time, he was a member of PORS (Poslednji Ostatak Romantičnog Sveta, trans. Last Remnants of Romantic World) with Radomir Mihailović Točak on guitar.\n\nSimultaneously, teenage Đorđević, along with a group of friends, began breaking and entering into apartment units around his hometown Čačak, looking for money and other valuables. Some of the stolen funds obtained this way were used to purchase musical equipment. After three years of committing burglaries, they were arrested and charged as juvenile delinquents. Đorđević spent seven days in prison detention before being released to await the sentencing. The sentence was soon delivered in the form of an order for \"enhanced parental supervision and occasional control of the social services\". Upon being released from prison detention, he got promptly expelled from the gymnasium he had been attending.\n\nĐorđević's parents decided to move the family to Belgrade where he enrolled at the Fifth Belgrade Gymnasium. For three years after arriving to Belgrade he didn't participate in any music-related activities.\n\nAt the time of his matriculation, nineteen-year-old Đorđević auditioned for the staging of the \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" rock opera at Atelje 212, getting one of the apostle roles. Featuring Korni Grupa singer Zlatko Pejaković in the lead role of Jesus Christ, Branko Milićević as Pontius Pilate, and acoustic singer-songwriter Srđan Marjanović as one of the priests, the show premiered in June 1972. It was performed 21 times over the next year until its last show in June 1973.\n\nĐorđević would continue acting in theatre, mostly as an extra, appearing in Atelje 212 plays \"\", \"Tom Pejn\", and \"Caca u metrou\".\n\nIn late March 1973, twenty-year-old Đorđević formed the acoustic rock band Zajedno (\"Together\") with three female vocalists — Ivana Kačunković alongside twin sisters Vukica \"Viki\" and Gordana \"Goca\" Stefanović — and keyboardist Đorđe Petrović, all fellow students at the Fifth Belgrade Gymnasium. The band often recorded jingles for radio shows. On invitation from actor Zoran Radmilović, whom Đorđević had met while participating in the \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" staging at Atelje 212, the band joined a conceptual theatre tour named \"Selu u pohode\". Featuring a somewhat hippie vibe, the summer 1973 tour, that in addition to Zajedno members and Radmilović also featured painter , visited numerous remote Socialist Republic of Serbia villages with the aim of exposing its inhabitants to various forms of arts and culture such as acoustic music, painting, and theatre.\n\nZajedno's debut release, seven-inch single with tracks \"Vizija\" and \"Goro moja\", was released in 1974 by PGP RTB. Đorđević composed the music for the A-side track while the B-side track used the lyrics from the eponymous poem by Aleksa Šantić. With liner notes written by radio disk jockey Zoran Modli who used the opportunity to draw comparisons to YU Grupa's debut single from four years prior, the release brought Zajedno a small measure of prominence. In May 1974, Zajedno members wrote the music for the theatre play \"Bonton (ili kako se ponašati prema osobama suprotnog pola)\", starring Feđa Stojanović and Ružica Sokić, that was staged on Atelje 212's secondary 'Theatre in the Basement' stage. The play was performed 43 times over the following two years until the last show in May 1976 with Zajedno members — Đorđević, Petrović, and Ivana Kačunković — in addition to Kačunković's sister Jasna appearing in acting roles as singers and musicians on stage.\n\nIn parallel with being in Zajedno, young Đorđević worked numerous temporary side jobs. He was part of the production crew of the Radio Belgrade show \"Veče uz radio\" that was created, hosted, and produced by the Yugoslav rock'n'roll media pioneers Nikola Karaklajić and Peca Popović. Đorđević additionally filed radio reports from acoustic music festivals in Sivac, wrote articles for the \"Džuboks\" magazine about Yugoslav acoustic rock scene, and wrote a number of jingles for Beograd 202 and Studio B.\n\nHe left Zajedno in late 1974.\n\nIn January 1975, Đorđević formed acoustic rock band Suncokret (\"Sunflower\"). They gained popularity with folk rock-oriented songs and Đorđević's humorous lyrics. \n\nSuncokret worked with disk jockey Zoran Modli (whom Đorđević met as a member of Zajedno when Modli produced Zajedno's first single) with whom they released the seven-inch single \"Na putu za Stambol\" / \"Anđelija, čuvaj se Turaka\" under the name Hajduk Stanko i Jataci. Another single with Modli, \"Rock and roll duku duku\" / \"Gili, gili bluz\", was released under the name Zoran Modli i Suncokret. \n\nWith Suncokret, Đorđević recorded three more singles and album \"Moje bube\".\n\nĐorđević left Suncokret after the band refused to perform his song \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\". He accepted Đorđe Balašević's invitation and, with another former Suncokret member, female vocal Bilja Krstić, became a member of Balašević's band Rani Mraz. This was the most famous, but a short-lasting Rani Mraz lineup, and besides Đorđe Balašević, Bora Đorđević and Bilja Krstić featured female vocal Verica Todorović. This lineup held several performances in Dom omladine and Student's Cultural Centre in Belgrade. Đorđević performed songs \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\", \"Mirno spavaj\" and \"Zvezda potkorvlja i suterena\" (all of them will later be recorded on Riblja Čorba's debut album \"Kost u grlu\") and Balašević entertained the audience with his humorous stories. This Rani Mraz lineup recorded famous song \"Računajte na nas\", which praised People's Liberation War from a slightly different perspective than habitual socialist realism, and soon became an anthem of Yugoslav youth. This lineup also recorded single with songs \"Oprosti mi, Katrin\" and \"Život je more\".\n\nAfter Rani Mraz performance on Split music festival and only forty-five days spent in the band Đorđević left Rani Mraz. After returning to Belgrade he formed hard rock band Riblja Čorba with SOS members Miša Aleksić, Rajko Kojić and Vicko Milatović. Their debut album \"Kost u grlu\" saw huge success and the band became very popular in a few months. The band's popularity grew, but it has also started manifesting in Đorđević's alcoholism, which has, together with his provocative social-related lyrics, caused him to become one of the most controversial musicians in Yugoslavia. He has remained a frontman and leader of Riblja Čorba from its formation to today.\n\nĐorđević's unplugged performance with Arsen Dedić in Terazije Theatre in 1987 resulted in a famous bootleg album \"Arsen & Bora Čorba Unplugged `87\". \"Bora priča gluposti\", released in 1988 features a recording of his poetry evening. In 1996 he released \"Njihovi dani\" on which he demonstrated his anti-Milošević attitudes.\n\nĐorđević made a guest appearance on numerous projects. With Minđušari he recorded controversial songs \"E, moj druže zagrebački\" and \"Ljetovanje\", released on Minđušari 1993 album \"Armija srpska\". Other artist he recorded songs with include Bijelo Dugme, Balkan, Kerber, Zoran Predin, Arsen Dedić, Rambo Amadeus, Biljana Krstić, Dejan Cukić, Vlada i Bajka and others. He was also involved in recording of a cult compilation album \"Paket aranžman\". He wrote songs for Zdravko Čolić, Bisera Veletanlić, Generacija 5, Đorđe Marjanović, Neda Ukraden, Rajko Kojić, Dušan Prelević, Oliver Mandić, Šaban Šaulić, Poslednja Igra Leptira, Denis & Denis, Viktorija, Željko Bebek, Lepa Brena, Ceca Ražnatović, Zana, Prljavi Inspektor Blaža i Kljunovi, Baja Mali Knindža, Nedeljko Bajić Baja and others.\n\nĐorđević released his first book of poems \"Ravnodušan prema plaču\" (\"Apathetic towards Crying\") in 1985. \n\nIn 1987 he released his second book of poems \"Hej, Sloveni\" (\"Hey, Slavs\") and in 1988 became a member of the Association of Writers of Serbia (UKS). Đorđević, reputedly, wrote the application on a table napkin. His membership in the Association of Writers of Serbia was not well received by some of the members. \n\nĐorđević released eight more books: \n\nBecause of his provocative social and political-related lyrics, his support for Serbian nationalism coupled with his opposition to communism, Slobodan Milošević and the political involvement as the Democratic Party of Serbia member, Đorđević was a subject of many controversies:\n\n\nBora Đorđević was married to Dragana Đorđević for 30 years, until they were divorced in February 2007; they have a son, and a daughter from Dragans's first marriage. Soon afterward, on 23 March 2007, Dragana ended her life by mixing alcohol and prescription drugs.\n\nĐorđević remarried in 2009, this time to his twenty-eight years younger girlfriend Aleksandra Savić. They had met in 2007 while Đorđević was on tour with Riblja Čorba in the United States. During 2014, it was reported that the pair are splitting, after four and a half years of marriage. This was confirmed by Đorđević in April, several days after finalizing their divorce. \n\nShortly after, Đorđević confirmed speculations that he has a new girlfriend, Dubravka Milatović, from Slovenia. In May 2016, the couple married in a private ceremony on Greek island Santorini. Many songs on Riblja Čorba latest studuio album \"Da tebe nije\" (\"If not for you\"), Đorđević wrote and devoted to his wife. Album cover also contains her picture in drawing.

The Condors played home games at Rabobank Arena.\n\nOriginally known as the \"Bakersfield Fog\", the team was founded in 1995 as a charter member of the West Coast Hockey League. They replaced the Bakersfield Oilers of the Pacific Southwest Hockey League when that league folded in 1994. The team became the \"Condors\" in 1998 when it moved into the new Centennial Garden. The Condors, and other West Coast Hockey League teams, joined the ECHL in 2003.\n\nFor the 2008–09 season, the Condors announced an affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League on May 21, 2008. They became the Ducks' secondary affiliate, after the Iowa Chops of the American Hockey League. In the following season, the Condors became the Ducks' primary affiliate after the Chops were suspended from operations. As a result, the Condors started the season with a handful of the Ducks' prospects and finished the season first in the Pacific to capture their first division title. On July 12, 2010, the Ducks opted to move their ECHL affiliate closer to their East Coast AHL affiliate and cut ties with the Condors after two seasons.\n\nOn July 18, 2013, the Condors announced an affiliation with the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nOn January 23, 2014, it was announced that the team was purchased by the Daryl Katz-owned Oilers Entertainment Group, which also owns the Edmonton Oilers. In January 2015, it was announced that the ECHL incarnation of the Condors would be relocating to Norfolk, Virginia and become the Norfolk Admirals after being displaced by the Oklahoma City Barons of the American Hockey League relocating to become the new Bakersfield Condors for the 2015–16 season. The original Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League were also relocated following the 2014–15 season to San Diego, California.\n\nList of Bakersfield Condors alumni who played more than 25 games in Bakersfield and 25 or more games in the National Hockey League.\nKnown for his journalistic contributions, Ken Baker, played one game as goaltender for the Condors in the 2001–02 season, finishing with a win, a 5.00 GAA and a 0.857 save percentage. Baker's dreams of playing professional hockey were cut short due to a tumor that inhibited his ability to build enough muscle for the sport. However, his book \"They Don't Play Hockey in Heaven\" tells the story of his experience with the Condors.\n\nMoreover, Canadian singer and songwriter, Justin Bieber, was also offered a tryout contract by the Bakersfield Condors in September 2012. The Condors released their entry level offer after stating that \"Bieber has some hockey skills\".\n\n\nThe Condors advanced past the 1st Round of the playoffs for the first time in their history in the 2005–06 season. They defeated the Long Beach Ice Dogs in seven games. The Condors lost in the seventh game of the next round against the Fresno Falcons, making it the longest playoff run in Condors history at the time. The Condors did it again the following year, defeating Fresno, but then lost in round 2 to the Alaska Aces in four games. However, in the 2013–14 season, the Condors had their furthest playoff run in team history, getting to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the Alaska Aces in 6 games, winning 2 and losing 4.\n\nIn the 2004–05 ECHL playoffs, Condor Ashlee Langdone checked Alaska Ace Scott Gomez (who was playing that season in the ECHL due to the NHL lockout) hard, sending him hip first into the sharp opening of the bench door at the exact moment the trainer opened it for a line change. The resulting injury, a broken pelvis, knocked Gomez out of the rest of the playoffs, and resulted in Langdone being given a boarding penalty and a one-game suspension. The incident drew a rather negative reaction due to Gomez's status as an NHL all-star.\n\nIn March 2011, the Condors held \"Charlie Sheen Night\" which garnered national media attention as one of the best promotions in minor league sports history. The promotion, based on the antics of the \"Two and a Half Men\" actor, offered fans free admission with proof of a clean drug test, \"tiger blood\" margaritas, Charlie Sheen heads on sticks, and if anyone had the money, they could buy the team for $2 million outright. That was Sheen's annual salary for the show he was eventually fired from.\n\nHead coach Marty Raymond and former assistant coach Mark Pederson were briefly suspended in 2009 for an \"internal matter\", which was reported at the time to be due to anti-Semitic comments made by both men toward then-Condor Jason Bailey, a Jewish player. The team did not publicly acknowledge the reason for the suspensions until after the season, when GM Matthew Riley stated that \"all parties involved were satisfied with the action that was taken.\" However, in January 2011, the Anaheim Ducks, Condors, Raymond and Pederson were named in a lawsuit filed by Bailey's lawyer, Keith Fink, alleging that his client faced \"a barrage of anti-Semitic, offensive and degrading verbal attacks regarding his Jewish faith\" during this time with the team. On January 27, ESPN.com released details of court documents in which Fink alleges that Condors' owner Jonathan Fleisig failed to take action after being informed of the issue: promising Bailey's father that the Raymond and Pederson would both be fired, but then failing to do so. The documents also allege that Raymond told Bailey his ex-wife was Jewish and that she was \"a 'bitch' for taking all of his money.\"\n\n"}

His family immigrated to the United States in 1815, when he was 2 years old, settling in Little York, Pennsylvania. While his mother had been a member of the Presbyterian Church while in Ireland, her husband was not affiliated with any sect. His father died when Andrew was 8 years old after a long illness. During this time the family was frequently visited by a Methodist minister, which resulted in the family becoming Members of the Methodist Church. \n\nHunter attended college in Missouri for a short time before moving in 1835 he moved to Manchester, Missouri, near St. Louis, and began teaching school. While there he saw in a church paper a letter from Peter McGowan, the Superintendent of South Indian Missionary District urgently calling for teachers in Indian Schools. Hunter decided to travel the three hundred miles to the Indian Mission in Fort Gibson. At the time this was over very rough terrain through routes that typically followed streams, often having to sleep out in the open. The school consisted of around 20 students, and was located near where Kansas, Missouri and Texas Railroad crossed the Arkansas River North to Muskogee, in a yard donated by a Mr. Lott. Although Hunter was living in relative poverty, sleeping in a makeshift bed in the school house and eating with whomever would have him, Hunter considered this the happiest time of his life. \n\nIn 1836, due to his service in the school, he was give a license to preach and a recommendation from the quarterly conference, which consisted mostly of Indians. The Arkansas Conference had been set up the same year, and Hunter was received \"on trial.\" The conference was divided into four districts, over which the presiding elders traveled quarterly. Hunter was first appointed to a missionary school at Bayou Baynard, and this began his long career as a Methodist minister. He was ordained a deacon in Fayetteville, Arkansas in 1839 he became an elder in Little Rock, Arkansas. In the fall of 1842 he was made presiding elder of the Washington District, which comprised a large portion of Southern Arkansas. He served as pastor of what is now First United Methodist Church in Little Rock twice, first appointed in 1842. He became one of the most popular preachers in Arkansas as well being well respected throughout the country. In 1866-67 he was elected to represent Dallas and Bradley Counties in the Arkansas State senate and was president of that body. In 1866 Hunter was elected US Senator from Arkansas by the State Legislature along with Elisha Baxter, however he was not allowed to take his seat in Congress due to disenfranchisement of Southern States at the beginning of Reconstruction. Augustus Hill Garland took his place instead.\n\nDr. Hunter died on June 3, 1902, in his 89th year, after having held almost every office his church offered: teacher, missionary, pastor of both small and great churches, presiding elder for 20 years, delegate to Annual Conferences, a member of 12 General Conferences, and of the 1891 Ecumenical Conference.\nHe was laid to rest in Oakland Cemetery, beside his wife. The Hunters were married in 1844 and had four children. Mrs. Hunter was active in establishing the Woman's Missionary Society of the Little Rock Conference in 1878. Elected president of the organization in 1879, she served in that office for five years.\nAt the time of Hunter's death, Dr. John H. Riggin described him as a pulpiteer, saying: “His mellow, vibrant voice made his speech impressive. His hearers soon understood that there was nothing rash or inconsiderate in his words, nothing light or trifling, nothing for show or merely to attract attention to the speaker, that the message – not himself – was his concern…”\n\nThe Andrew Hunter House, a house he lived in, is near Bryant, Arkansas, built in c.1870 is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nA newspaper clipping dated December 3, 1898, reads: “Last Sunday should be a red letter day in its history and one to be remembered by members of Hunter’s Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church, South. On that day was formally opened for public worship one of the prettiest, neatest, most comfortable and, in everything, completest houses dedicated to God that Little Rock has yet had built within her bounds. Well may the good folks of Hunter Memorial feel proud. With becoming modesty, they are loath to assume the credit for what has been done, giving praise to God first for enabling them to carry our that work which He has put in the mind of their reverend benefactor, Leon Le Fevre to design and plan for the.”\nAside note appeared in the 1947 publication stating that “Leon Le Fevre, member of a French family that had settled at the Little Rock site before the region became American territory, had bequeathed $2,800 in cash and a plantation, for the construction of a Methodist Church .”\nThe Rev. James Major, pastor of Hunter Church from 1945 to 1948, wrote a history of the church for the 50th anniversary celebration which included the following statements: “It was the life of Andrew Hunter that inspired a wealthy man by the name of Leon Le Fevre to leave in his will property valued at $5,000 to be sold and the proceeds used for the building of a Methodist Church east of what is now McArthur Park and south of East 9th Street.”\nThe cornerstone for the first church was laid on March 27, 1897, on Barber Avenue, between 11th and 12th streets. Dr. Hunter dedicated the church on the last Sunday in March 1901, after all the indebtedness was paid.\n"}

Satellite distribution allowed high-fidelity (15 kHz) stereo programming to its affiliates. \n\nThe newscasts, aimed at a young adult audience, had a conversational, high-energy style developed by co-founders Vice President and News Director Dave Cooke, and Vice President of Programming Jo Interrante. \n\nRKO was popular from the start, signing up hundreds of affiliates coast to coast. Its base was the RKO General-owned radio stations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other large markets. RKO initially purchased downlink satellite dishes for its affiliates, creating the nation's first satellite-delivered commercial radio network. \n\nThe original network, which fed newscasts at :50 repeated at :00, became known as \"RKO 1\" when \"RKO 2\" debuted on September 1, 1981. \"RKO 2\" fed newscasts at :20 repeated at :30 and was aimed at an older audience. Both networks offered sportscasts, music, public affairs programming and closed-circuit affiliate feeds of news and sports correspondent reports and news-maker actualities.\n\nThe networks were home to three groundbreaking long-form programs. \"NightTime America with Bob Dearborn\" was the first live, daily, satellite-delivered music show in radio history. Dearborn produced and hosted the five-hour adult contemporary show from January 9, 1981, until 1984. January 9, 1981, was also the premier of \"America Overnight\", a six-hour interview and call-in show hosted by Eric Tracey in Los Angeles and Ed Busch from Dallas. It was the first national talk show delivered by satellite. It also marked the first time a network offered simultaneous overnight programs. Dick Bartley created, produced and hosted the first live national oldies radio show, \"Solid Gold Saturday Night\".\n\nThe RKO Radio Networks were headquartered at 1440 Broadway in New York City, also the home of co-owned WOR (AM). The offices were the former headquarters of the Mutual Broadcasting System when RKO General owned Mutual. RKO also staffed news bureaus in Washington, D.C., and London.\n\nThe network aired the last interview with John Lennon, recorded at The Dakota just hours before his death on December 8, 1980, by Dave Sholin, a San Francisco DJ, with radio producer Ron Hummel, who put together many music specials for RKO.\n\nAfter advertising billing scandals involving RKO's television stations and later the radio networks came to light, the RKO Radio Networks were sold in 1985 to the United Stations Radio Networks. Dick Clark Productions, owner of United Stations, sold the RKO Radio Network entity to Tom Ficara in 1990. United Stations was merged with Transtar Radio Networks to form Unistar Radio Networks in 1987. Unistar was absorbed by Westwood One in 1994 and its affiliates were switched to the Mutual Broadcasting System.\n\nAmong RKO Radio Network alumni are\nKevin Gordon - news anchor (later NBC Radio Network news anchor and New York Times radio news anchor and classical music host)\n\n"}

While officially unaffiliated in their first season, the Inferno soon reached a working relationship with the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League that turned into a formal affiliation the following season and later with Manitoba's National Hockey League affiliate, the Vancouver Canucks. On July 10, 2006, the team announced the end of their affiliation with the Moose and Canucks and announced a new affiliation with the Toronto Marlies (AHL) and the Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL) two days later.\n\nThe Inferno was originally slated to move across the street to the Colonial Life Arena after the 2007–08 ECHL season, but legal issues with the arena's funding prevented the move. The team was voluntarily suspended for the 2008–09 season as the team was told that it could not be guaranteed a lease with the Carolina Coliseum in time to meet league requirements. The voluntary suspension was extended during subsequent seasons and, according to Joe Babik, the Director of Communications for the ECHL, included the 2012–13 season.\n\nHowever, as of the 2013–14 season the team had not returned since its 2008 suspension.

The label was originally an outlet for (more or less left wing) German punk bands such as the and the Razors. These early bands sang in English, which led to the following comment by John Peel, who wrote to Egoldt in May 1980: \"One thing about the records. Why do German singers sing in English? Is it because it is fashionable? Or is it a marketing consideration? Whichever it is, I think they should sing in German anyway.\"\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Rock-O-Rama was best known for white power rock bands like Skrewdriver. By then, the label had left its punk roots behind and concentrated on records by neo-Nazi and far right bands.

The team won division titles in eight of its ten seasons.\n\nThe team never won an ECHL championship, and toward the end of its existence attendance dropped. The 2004–05 season was plagued with team financial issues; drops in attendance led the Cajundome to no longer allow seating in the 300 level seats.

With an optimal range of 290 km, it is named after the 11th century Muslim Turkic conqueror Mahmud of Ghazni. The word \"Hatf\" means \"deadly\" or \"vengeance\" in Arabic. It entered service with the Pakistan Army in 2012 after a successful launch conducted by ASFC (Army Strategic Command Force) on May 10, 2012.\n\nThe Hatf-III is \"Scud\" type ballistic missile. The missile could carry nuclear and conventional warheads to a range of 290 km.\nThe Hatf III was the second nuclear-capable missile test-fired by the Pakistan army in less than two weeks, since India's launch of Agni-V.\n\nThe missile has a length of 9.64m, diameter of 0.99 m, launch weight of 5256 kg and is powered by a single stage solid fuel rocket motor. It is believed influenced from a Chinese design, the M-11 (NATO reporting name: CSS-7).\n\nInitially, the Pakistan government was actively pushing for acquiring the M-11 missiles from China with the intention of a quick deployment. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto personally lobbied in China for the M-11 missiles, but was unable to do so due to intense pressure mounted by the United States and the MTCR's strict monitoring of prevention of the technology transfers of the missiles. Development on \"Ghaznavi\" started in 1990s after the refusal of export of M-11 missiles from China to Pakistan. The \"Ghaznavi\" was pursued alongside the Abdali program, and its features are extremely close to those of the Chinese M-11. The Ghaznavi program contract was awarded to NDC.\n\nThe Pakistan military officials consistently maintained that the Ghaznavi program is locally designed and indigenously built. In 1995, its engine was successfully tested and was said to be a \"major break-through in missile development in Pakistan\".\n\nThe \"Ghaznavi\" took its first spaceflight on 26 May 2002, at the height of the military standoff between India and Pakistan. On 3 October 2003, the \"Ghaznavi\" was again successfully test fired from an undisclosed location, which was described by the military as \"highly successful\". The \"Ghaznavi\" successfully reached its target and has a range of 290km (180mi), making it capable of striking several key targets within neighboring nuclear rival, India. The \"Ghaznavi\" entered in the service in March 2004 and currently with the Pakistan Army.\n\nIts third test launched took place on 8 December 2004; subsequent tests were conducted on 9 December 2006 another on 13 February 2008 and 8 May 2010; the 2008 test was believed to have concluded a winter training exercise of Pakistan's Army Strategic Force Command (ASFC). In May 2012, one more successful test of the missile was conducted as part of a training exercise.\n\nPakistan successfully carried out night training launch of Ghaznavi missile on August 28, 2019. \n\nDuring its development at the NDC, the program was named in the memory of Mahmud of Ghazni– the 10th century Turkic emperor who founded the Ghaznavid Empire and frequently invaded India. The JS HQ, however, officially codenames the missile as \"Hatf–III Ghaznavi\".\n\n"}

The team planned to move to another venue, but it did not materialize.\n\nThe facility is also home to university classrooms with classes held in the lower levels. The high school commencement ceremonies of many high schools in the South Carolina Midlands are held annually in the arena as many school venues are too small for such ceremonies.\n\nPrior to the building of the Coliseum, the Gamecocks had played in Carolina Fieldhouse from 1927 until it burned in 1968, and the Carolina Gymnasium (now the Longstreet Theater) prior to that.\n\nThe Coliseum was the host of the NCAA Basketball Tournament East Regional in 1970.

The group sometimes refers to its fans as \"zuggalos\".\n\nZug Izland formed in 2001, named after an industrial site near Detroit. The band was formed by Insane Clown Posse member Violent J (Joseph Bruce) and Mike Puwal, out of Bruce's love of rock music. Bruce wanted to know what a \"Juggalo Rock\" band would sound like. Zug Izland's songs were written and developed during the recording of Insane Clown Posse's album \"\".\n\nBruce and Puwal completed the basic tracks for two songs, but still required a lead singer. Bruce wanted a singer similar to Kurt Cobain, Eddie Vedder, Jim Morrison or Axl Rose. Although Syn was sought by three other bands at the time, he joined Zug Izland as their official singer. The band broke onto the national competitive music scene in 2003 with their debut album, \"Cracked Tiles\".\n\nThe album peaked at No. 48 on the \"Billboard Heatseekers\" chart and at No. 31 on the \"Top Independent Albums\" chart. Zug Izland released a follow-up album \"\" the 1st of June 2004. It peaked at No. 26 on the \"Top Heatseekers\" chart and at No. 22 on the \"Top Independent Albums\" chart. The release of the \"3:33\" album amicably fulfilled Psychopathic Records contract with Zug Izland.\n\nAfter parting ways with Psychopathic Records after the release of 3:33, Zug Izland began writing and recording songs for a new album entitled \"Promised Land\". The ill-fated album was never released however tracks 'Next To Me\", \"Lies\" and \"How Does it Feel\" were released officially online with leaked songs \"Promised land\" and \"Woke Up Screaming\" surfacing online some time later. The Syn written and recorded \"Chemical Girl\" was also released via the official Zug Izland MySpace page, however it has also never featured on an album.\n\nIn 2005, Zug Izland recorded a cover of Pink Floyd classic \"Another Brick In The Wall\". The track was a crowd favourite that Zug Izland would often cover at their live shows. Re-working the lyrics, the new track took a \"Juggalo\" theme replacing Pink Floyd's child chorus with a group of angry Juggalos screaming \"Hey! People! Leave Juggalos alone!\" in reference to the Juggalo culture's misrepresentation in mainstream media. The finished track was made available through the ZugIzland.com, but never made available on an official release.\n\nFollowing years of touring and various line up changes, Zug Izland reunited, and returned to Psychopathic Records, announcing plans to reissue \"Cracked Tiles\" record a new album and tour with Insane Clown Posse in promotion of ICP's \"Mighty Death Pop!\" album. In the December 21, 2012 edition of \"Hatchet Herald\", it was revealed that Zug Izland would release a \"greatest hits\" album, featuring three newly recorded songs recorded by Violent J and Mike Puwal.\n\nIn August 2013 Zug Izland's greatest hits compilation \"Toxicology: Zug Izland's Dopest Bangers\" was released on Psychopathic Records, their first official release since 3:33 in 2004. The album featured a collection of tracks from their debut album Cracked Tiles, three remastered songs from 3:33 and three new recordings. The new songs reverted to the writing/recording process of Cracked Tiles with Violent J of Insane Clown Posse writing lyrics and Mike P writing the music. According to Faygoluvers.net the line up is now Syn, Mike P, D-Lay & 2 Phat.\n\nAllmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus describes Zug Izland's music style as incorporating elements of piano ballads, goth, industrial and electronic music, nu metal and horror film scores. According to Loftus, \"Zug Izland's sparer style [is] unique in an alt-metal climate of two-guitar lineups and monstrous six-string bass bottom ends.\"\n\n\n\n\nOn the \"Bloodstepp\" track \"Underground MVP\" also featuring Big Hoodoo, Axe Murder Boyz, Spice 1, DJ Clay and KidCrusher from the album \"Grand Theft UFO: Floppy Disk Edition\" released in 2014.\n\n"}

Mortier started in 1898 as a vending agent for the Parisian organ builder Gavioli & Cie, in a period when the French and German organ industry was in full bloom. Theophile Mortier was originally the manager of a dance hall, in which there was always a Gavioli organ playing. He made it a habit to sell the installed organ after a short while. He was fortunate enough most of the time to make a profit on selling these used organs. As time went by he became more and more an organ dealer and a very good customer of Gavioli. He set up a repair shop in order to provide maintenance and repair for the organs, which he had sold. The organ builder Guillaume Bax managed this shop. In 1906 Mortier started to build organs himself, as an annex of the Gavioli company. \n\nDue to internal operations difficulties, Gavioli could after a while not deliver enough orders and Mortier began to manufacture the dance organs under his own name. After the First World War the company expanded to a size where they employed 80 personnel and had a capacity to build about 20 large dance organs per year. No other manufacturer has matched the cubic meter volume of organs produced by Mortier. The company stayed active until 1948.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 9, 2000. In the episode, while the rest of the Simpson family goes skiing, Marge remains at the ski lodge due to her fear of skiing, only to break her leg from a falling clock. As a result, while hospitalized, Marge leaves Lisa to take care of the house. When Bart and Homer refuse to help out with the chores, Lisa pulls a prank on them by making it look like they have leprosy. The episode includes a guest appearance from Elwood Edwards, and features several references to Lucille Ball and her television work.\n\nWhen Marge is cleaning out the attic and looking for old things to send away to charity, Homer and the children refuse to let her, prompting Marge to look at all the junk she is trying to get rid of. She shows Homer several skis he never used since buying them after the Nagano Olympics. To spite Marge, he decides to use them, so the family go on a skiing trip. When they are there, Marge decides that she wants to avoid skiing or snowboarding for fear of injury, which makes her stay at the ski lodge. Ironically, she winds up breaking her leg here when a loose-hanging cuckoo clock falls on it. She is sent to the hospital where she is told that she must stay there until her cast is removed.\n\nIn the meantime, Lisa offers to take her place, making a structured plan for Homer and Bart to do some of the chores, which Lisa chooses through a chore hat. Unfortunately, Homer and Bart do them in an extremely apathetic, ineffective, sandy-eyed manner. Marge is enjoying her time in the hospital, due to getting a massage, among other things. The lazy lifestyles of Homer and Bart have taken their toll on the house, which is now a disorganized, filthy hovel with trash, and Lisa struggling to make ends meet. She eventually calls Marge and asks if she can return, but Marge, who enjoys the lifestyle of lying all day in bed not working, lies to Lisa saying she is still too injured to come back. Lisa, angered and desperate for answers, sees the ghost of Lucille Ball, who has an idea to get revenge. She suggests that she pull a clever trick on Homer and Bart while they are asleep. She does just that, and using green poster paint mixed with oatmeal on the men, she tricks them into thinking that they have intense leprosy.\n\nThe next morning, Homer and Bart are told by Lisa, who hopes this will make them clean up the house, they have leprosy from living in dirty conditions. After the Virtual Doctor computer program confirms that Homer and Bart indeed have leprosy, Homer and Bart panic and decide to visit Ned Flanders in search of a cure. Ned sends Homer and Bart to a leper colony in Hawaii, where they will receive electric needle treatment and sanded. Once Marge's cast has finally come off (and her excess leg hair has been waxed), she comes home to see Lisa finally finished cleaning the entire house. They decide to seek out Homer and Bart in Hawaii. When they arrive, Lisa admits that she only played a trick on Homer and Bart, though they already know the leprosy is fake because Homer ate one of its sores and found it tasty; however, the whole family wants to stay there on account of it being a \"free vacation\", despite Homer and Bart suffering through the painful treatments.\n\n\"Little Big Mom\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Mark Kirkland as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). Elwood Edwards, known as the voice of the Internet service provider America Online, guest starred in the episode as the Virtual Doctor that confirms Homer and Bart's leprosy.\n\nThe episode features several references to the late American actress Lucille Ball and her many television sitcoms starring characters named Lucy. For example, it is the ghost of Ball that gives Lisa the idea to trick Homer and Bart into thinking they have leprosy. Ball is portrayed with a cigarette in her hand in that scene, and speaks with a raspy voice. When Lisa first sees the ghost, she cries out \"Lucy?\", to which Ball responds \"Lucy McGillicuddy Ricardo Carmichael. [Coughs] And I think there's some more.\" According to Michael Karol, author of the 2004 book \"Lucy A to Z\", the last names \"are those of Ball's characters from \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Lucy Show\". Left out were Lucy Carter of \"Here's Lucy\" and Lucy Barker of \"Life with Lucy\".\" \"The Simpsons\" cast member Tress MacNeille provided the voice of Ball in the episode. Additional references to Ball's work featured in \"Little Big Mom\" include Homer and Bart watching \"I Love Lucy\" with the volume turned up high, disturbing Lisa when she is trying to sleep. An \"Itchy & Scratchy\" cartoon that references the \"Job Switching\" episode of \"I Love Lucy\" is also seen in the episode.\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 9, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Matt Selman, Carolyn Omine, and Mark Kirkland participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: \"We’ve seen 'the family goes to crap without Marge around' episodes in the past, so don’t expect any reinvented wheels here. Still, the sight of Lisa in charge adds a decent spin, and the leprosy twist – while silly – proves amusing. It’s another unexceptional show but one with its moments.\" \n\nBefore this episode, \"The Simpsons\" had referenced Lucille Ball several times. Michael Karol wrote in \"Lucy A to Z\" that \"perhaps the funniest tribute came in [...] 'Little Big Mom.'\" Dan Castellaneta, who provides the voice of Homer in the series, considers this episode to be one of his personal favorites.\n\nBecause \"Little Big Mom\" deals with leprosy, it has never been released in Japan. According to Shari Ross Altarac in her doctoral dissertation \"The Adaptation of U.S. Television in Foreign Markets: How France and Japan Put Their Distinctive Spin on \"The Simpsons\"\", the reason behind this is that \"Former segregation laws remain a sensitive topic in Japan, where litigation of leprosy cases and charges of human rights abuses by the Japanese government have ensued.\" (See Leprosy in Japan.)\n\n"}

It was first shown as a Halloween special on CBS television, and later it was awarded the Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival.\n\nThe film is loosely structured, jumping between several simple stories. Many of these situations use staple clichés of horror films, such as undead monsters and the dark and stormy night. The stories sometimes turn macabre, but are presented in a lighthearted fashion. They are mainly as those in the printed comic, including lots of background throwaway gags from well-known panels.\n\nThe characters and settings are all common to Larson's work, such as aliens, anthropomorphic animals and other objects, and cowboys in the Old West. The art style is essentially the same as that of \"The Far Side\", though the film necessarily adds animation and sound effects.\n\nThe animation was made in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at director-animator Marv Newland's International Rocketship Productions.\n\nThe film features an original music score by jazz guitarist Bill Frisell. Some of the compositions from the soundtrack are included on his 1996 album \"Quartet\".\n\nIn 1997 the film spawned a sequel, \"Tales from the Far Side II\". This follow-up was never broadcast on American television, but it aired in the UK on BBC and appeared in numerous film festivals. Both films were released on VHS and DVD and were available for purchase by U.S. addresses from the official Far Side website, but are currently sold out.\n\n"}

Jackson, an African American electrical engineer working as a consultant raising capital for black business investments. Sydney L. Small, a former employee of ABC Radio Network was recruited to join the group. Mr. Pauley finally became frustrated with the difficult task of raising the $1,000,000 in capital needed to start the operation and abandon the effort. Jackson and Small along with Del Raycee of Mutual Broadcasting System persevered and finally launch the National Black Network on July 2, 1972 in New York City with 25 affiliates. \n\nNBN aired 5-minute newscasts at the hour and sportscasts several times a day at the half-hour. NBN also aired a wide variety of public affairs programs and a live overnight talk show hosted by Bob Law. In 1972 there were only 17 African American owned radio stations even though there were over 125 African American oriented station in the country, and by 1976 Eugene D. Jackson became the only African American on the 125 member Board of Directors of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). \n\nWith over 80 affiliates associated with NBN, Jackson wanted to see more radio stations owned by African Americans and therefore, conceived and started the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (NABOB) in Atlanta as a complement to his position on the NAB Board. Within 15 years, the number of African American owned radio station moved to almost 50 through the creation of Broadcap, a capital raising institution formed by the NAB and the captains of the television and radio industry. In the early 1980s NBN offered a second news service, American Urban Information Radio, which broadcast an hourly newscast at 50 minutes past the hour, but concentrated on in-depth reporting. By the early 1990s, NBN merged with its main competitor, the Sheridan Broadcasting Network (formerly the Mutual Black Network), to form the American Urban Radio Networks.\n\nThe first news director was Roy N. Wood Sr., from the famed Chicago radio station WVON, \"The voice of the Negro.\" In 1975 Roy Wood was replaced by Vince Sanders, another Chicago area talent and veteran of local black-formatted radio. Sanders, served as Vice President of Broadcast Operations at NBN until its demise in 1995. He joined NBN following 3 years with NBC news and its Chicago owned-and-operated station: WMAQ-AM. Before NBC, Sanders was a talk show host for 8 years at WBEE-AM in the Chicago market. His final assignment with NBN Broadcasting included Vice President and General Manager of its\nNew York City station, WWRL-AM. \n\nSmall and Jackson hired WABC's Malvin (Mal) Russell Goode to be a senior consultant and the network's United Nations correspondent. Working for ABC, Mr. Goode gained notoriety while being stationed at the UN, reporting the responses of President John F. Kennedy to the Bay of Pigs Invasion initiative of Fidel Castro. Mr. Goode continued working as a senior UN correspondent for National Black Network until 1991 when the two largest black radio networks in American merged to form the American Urban Radio Networks. Eugene Jackson and Sidney Small dissolved their partnership shortly before this merger, leaving Small to form the alliance with Ronald R. Davenport of the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.\n\nLong before Bob Law gained fame with \"Night Talk,\" there were a number of Black radio stars on the airwaves at NBN, such as Frank Bannister Jr., who also wrote the \"Black College Polls\" for Jet Magazine each week. The heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali made his presence known visiting Frank Bannister after a defeat to Leon Spinks. After his death from a heart attack, Bannister was replaced by Ron Pinkney, a former colleague of Gerald Bentley and Ed Castleberry, who were already on the airwaves of NBN.\n\nRoy Wood's \"One Black Man's Opinion\" was a major showcase of the former-WVON anchor, allowing him a no-holds-barred avenue to the listeners each week. Joseph \"Joe\" Brown hosted \"Black Issues In The Black Press,\" another weekly news program that focused on the issues of the day. The guest and talented performers ranged from Judge Bruce Wright to Evelyn \"Champagne\" King.\n\nEddie Kendricks and David Ruffin of The Temptations were seen joking and laughing it up with Ed Castleberry before airtime. Castleberry made his mark working with Larry Dean at Cincinnati's famed WCIN. Many in the business knew that Castleberry and \"Gentleman\" Dean were the real models for Venus Flytrap and Dr. Johnny Fever of television's WKRP in Cincinnati.\n\nNBN moved from 1350 Avenue of the Americas, New York City, to 10 Columbus Circle, and ended its reign at 4130 58th Street, Woodside, Queens. This was the same location that housed WWRL, a 1960s Black radio powerhouse that helped launch the career of black radio personality Francis \"Frankie\" Edward Crocker.\n\n\n"}

Her popular radio shows spanned more than 40 years. In the 1940s the daily audience for her housewife-oriented program numbered from six to eight million listeners. She was called \"The First Lady of Radio.\"\n\nMcBride was born on November 16, 1899 in Paris, Missouri, to a farming family. Their frequent relocations disorganized her early schooling, but at the age of six she became a student at a preparatory school called William Woods College, and at 16 the University of Missouri, receiving a degree in journalism there in 1919. She was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta at the University of Missouri.\n\nShe worked a year as a reporter at the Cleveland \"Press\", and then until 1924 at the New York \"Evening Mail\". Following this, she wrote freelance for periodicals including \"The Saturday Evening Post\", \"Cosmopolitan\", \"Good Housekeeping\", and starting in 1926 collaborated in writing travel-oriented books.\n\nMcBride first worked steadily in radio for WOR in New York City, starting in 1934. This daily women's-advice show, with her persona as \"Martha Deane\", a kind and witty grandmother figure with a Missouri-drawl, aired daily until 1940.\n\nOriginally, McBride's character \"Martha Deane\" was to be a grandmother with six children and many grandchildren-all imaginary. They were all named and described; she was to memorize the details. Her job was to talk colloquially and dispense philosophy. She kept getting all her \"grandchildren's\" names mixed up and within three weeks she jettisoned the whole tribe on air. She remained Martha Deane, but was no longer a grandmother.\n\nConcurrently with working as \"Deane\", in 1934 and 1935, she was the women's page editor for the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate.\n\nIn 1937, she launched on the CBS radio network the first of a series of similar and successful shows, now as Mary Margaret McBride. She had to abandon the Deane persona because WOR owned the name.\n\nShe interviewed figures well known in the world of arts and entertainment, and politics, with a style recognized as original to herself. She accepted advertising only for products she was prepared to endorse from her own experience, and turned down all tobacco or alcohol products.\n\nShe followed this format in regular broadcasts on\n\nHer NBC show in the 1940s had broad range of guests, from politicians to generals to movie stars; she never announced her guests in advance, so the audience tuned in with no idea what they would get. Beginning during World War II, she began \"breaking the color line\", mixing in African American guests. McBride was a popular media figure; the tea rose, 'Mary Margaret McBride' was named for her.\n\nIn September 1948, NBC brought McBride to television for a 30-minute prime time show on Tuesdays at 9pm EST. However, NBC abandoned the show in its partial third month, with \"Variety\" describing the attempt sarcastically, and \"The New York Times\" calling her the first major \"fatality\" of this kind.\n\nBelow is a review of one of her first television performances, reviewed by \"The New York Times\":\n\nFrom 1953 to 1956 she also conducted a syndicated newspaper column for the Associated Press.\n\nAbout 20 years apart, she wrote two books for girls, each with \"Elizabeth\" in the title.\n\nAs time went on, she appeared in smaller radio media markets, in upstate New York, and toward the end of her life hosted \"Your Hudson Valley Neighbor\" three times a week on WGHQ Kingston, NY from the living room of her home. Her longtime companion and business partner, Stella Karn, died in 1957.\n\nShe died at the age of 76 on April 7, 1976 at her home in West Shokan, New York. McBride's ashes were placed in her former rose garden. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her work in radio.\n\nAn account of her career, \"It's One O'clock and Here is Mary Margaret McBride: A Radio Biography\" by Susan Ware was published in early 2005. She is also discussed in depth in \"Radio Voices\" by Michele Hilmes.\n\nThe character of \"Mary McGoon\", featured in the comedy routines of Bob and Ray, is a parody of Mary Margaret McBride.\n\nThe TV host \"Molly Margaret McSnide\" in Fantastic Four issue 16 is an obvious reference.\n\nHer name was spoofed on the classic CBS-TV sitcom \"I Love Lucy\" in Episode # 79, \"The Million Dollar Idea\", which aired on January 11, 1954. In that installment, Lucy (\"Lucille Ball\") comes up with an ambitious idea to make money. She decides to appear on television selling her Aunt Martha's salad dressing. Assisting her on the program is her best friend Ethel Mertz (\"Vivian Vance\") as \"Mary Margaret McMertz.\"\n\nMcBride's celebrity was hardly a secret confined to daytime radio listeners, either: her 15th anniversary celebration in 1949 was held in Yankee stadium, the only facility large enough to hold the 75,000 people who filled every seat and formed huge crowds outside. Her magazine show was on the air continuously for 25 years.\n\nMcBride pioneered a style of ad-libbing her radio shows, meaning that the content in her show was not rehearsed prior to going on the air. She was acknowledged by \"Current Biography\" as \"the first woman to bring newspaper technique to radio interviewing and to make daytime broadcasts profitable.\" The method of sustaining her show was also distinct. McBride and manager Stella Karn would produce their show and then market it directly to sponsors in the New York area or broader national arena. This format allowed McBride and Karn to have complete agency over the content and format of the show. The two were consistently able to maintain a level of support from sponsors, meaning that they were able to produce content that was exactly how they envisioned it, free of outside changes. This model was also one of McBride's notable contributions to broadcasting, as it paved the way for independent producing.\n\nMary Margaret McBride and Stella Karn met in the early 1920s in an instance of complete happenstance. As McBride describes it as, “One day a bouncy woman, with eager brown eyes and auburn hair rolled into a bun, burst into our office and announced that she would be handling publicity for us.” McBride and Karn worked together for years, with Karn managing McBride and her show. McBride described the two of them in a Reader's Digest edition in 1962 as, \"No two people were more unlike. My reaction to a crisis was to dissolve into tears; Stella's was to charge into battle.\" The two moved in together in a small apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. McBride and Karn relied on each other for the entirety of their professional and personal lives.\n\nMcBride describes their first endeavor as a complete gamble motivated solely by Karn's optimism. During the Great Depression, the opportunity came for McBride to audition for a radio show, one of the only sources of entertainment at the time. When McBride got the job, she immediately recommended Karn as the person to handle the business side of the show's affairs. Karn and McBride became business partners, and Karn's first act on the job was to give her partner a raise.\n\nMcBride and Karn made a name for themselves as pioneers in the field of broadcasting, and also as trailblazers for the future of lesbian and bisexual journalists. McBride and Karn established their show as a connection point for lesbian and bisexual female creatives, forging friendships with influential names in broadcasting such as Ann Batchelder and Lisa Sergio.\n\n\n\n"}

The previous verse ends with Jesus being named by his father; this verse marks the clear start of a new narrative. This verse deals with the arrival of the magi at the court of Herod the Great in Jerusalem. This story of the magi continues until .\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe New International Version translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:1\n\nThe verse contains the full coverage given in Matthew to the birth of Jesus. Unlike Luke, Matthew pays very little attention to this event, focusing far more on what occurred before and after.\n\nThis is the first point in the Gospel that Bethlehem is mentioned. That it is specified as being \"in Judea\" is ascribed by Albright and Mann to the need to distinguish it from another Bethlehem in Zebulun, likely the modern town of Beit Lahna. Other scholars feel it is also to assert that Jesus was born in the heart of Judaism and also a link to the Old Testament figure Judas or Judah.\n\nJesus being born in Bethlehem is important to both Matthew and Luke, but it links especially closely to the genealogy in Matthew 1. The genealogy focuses on how Jesus was the heir to King David. David was born in Bethlehem and Jesus being born here cemented his role as the Davidic heir. Having him born in Bethlehem was also important as it is believed critics attacked Jesus' origin in the minor and peripheral town of Nazareth.\n\n\"Herod the King\" is accepted to refer to Herod the Great who ruled from around 47 BC and most likely died in 4 BC, but maybe lasted until 2 or 1 BC. All of these numbers seem to contradict that mentions a Roman census and that states Quirinius was governor of Syria. Luke thus seems to place Jesus' birth after 6 AD. That Matthew has Jesus' birth in the years BC is not a Biblical error. Rather it is attributed to Dionysius Exiguus who guessed incorrectly about when to start his calendar.\n\nThe word \"magi\" originally referred to Zoroastrian priests in Persia, but by the time this gospel was written it had come to mean anyone who dabbled in the occult arts such as magic, astrology, and dream interpretation. Since the chapter later refers to their interest in stars it is likely \"magi\" here refers to astrologers. The KJV translation as \"wise men\" is considered by modern scholars as quite inaccurate, mostly motivated by the desire not to imply any support for the arcane arts. Matthew never says how many magi there are, just that there are more than one. Traditions such as the magi being kings and having names developed later. There are many different translations of the word found, such as \"wise men\" and \"astrologers\". The only other place the word occurs in the New Testament is at and . The magi in question is a negative figure and the word is more often translated as \"magician\" or \"sorcerer\".\n\nThe phrase \"from the east\" is the only information Matthew provides on where the magi came from. Many scholars have theorized about where this east might be. Traditionally the view developed that the magi were Persian or Parthian, and art works generally depicted them in Persian dress. The main support for this is that the first magi were from Persia and that land still had the largest number of them. The interest in astronomy leads some to believe they were from Babylon, which was the centre of astrology at the time. The oldest attested theory, dating from 160 AD, is that they were from Arabia. This fits with the gifts they brought, which come from that part of the world. Brown comments that the author of Matthew probably didn't have a specific location in mind and the phrase \"from the east\" is for literary effect and added exoticism.\n\nSee also: The Journey of the Magi, Three Wise Men\n"}

The Kelly Cup has been awarded to teams since 1997. Prior to 1997, the playoff winner was awarded the Riley Cup, named after former American Hockey League president Jack Riley. The current cup is named after Patrick J. Kelly, the league's first commissioner. The cup is loaned to the winning team for one year and is returned at the start of the following year's playoffs, although the trophy itself has been replaced three times with the first two iterations preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Kelly Cup Playoffs Most Valuable Player award is also given out as part of the Kelly Cup Championship ceremonies. Nick Vitucci and Dave Gagnon are the only players to win the award on multiple occasions.\n\n18 different teams have won the ECHL Championship, with eight (Alaska, Allen, Cincinnati, Colorado, Hampton Roads, Idaho, South Carolina, and Toledo) winning multiple times. The Hampton Roads Admirals, the Alaska Aces and the South Carolina Stingrays hold the record for most championships won with three. The Colorado Eagles, who won it in 2018 for their second consecutive title, moved to the American Hockey League in 2018–19. In 2019, the Eagles' ownership did not return the Kelly Cup to the ECHL before the playoffs, leading to the league creating a replacement trophy for the 2019 Kelly Cup playoffs. The Eagles' ownership eventually returned the cup before the 2019–20 season, and the league returned its status to be the primary trophy. The 2019 Kelly Cup was the fourth copy of the trophy, but was allowed to be kept by the Growlers when the previous cup went back into circulation.\n\nThe Kelly Cup playoffs is an elimination tournament, consisting of four rounds of a best-of-seven series. The format has changed often throughout the years. Since 2016–17, the top four point earners from each division qualify. The first two playoff rounds are played within each division, followed by the conference finals (contested between the four division winners), and ending with the Kelly Cup finals (featuring the two conference champions).\n\n"}

He served as an alderman in Thorold from 1948 to 1950, and was deputy reeve from 1951 to 1954 and reeve from 1955 to 1965. He became a warden for Welland County in 1961, and was president of the Association of Ontario Mayors and Reeves in 1961-62. He later served temporarily as its part-time executive director around 1970.\n\nSwart campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada five times, but was never successful. He was defeated in Welland as a candidate of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in a 1950 by-election, and in the general elections of 1953, 1957 and 1958.\n\nHe ran again for the federal New Democratic Party in the 1962 election, and was again defeated.

He was drafted by the Chargers in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Northwestern.\n\nCastillo was one of the cover athlete for the Spanish language version of \"Madden NFL 08\".\n\nRaised in Garfield, New Jersey, Castillo attended Garfield High School, where he was team captain and team MVP of the football team, under coach Steven Mucha. Was a 4-year varsity letter winner in wrestling, unfortunately losing to eventual state champ John Miller of Pompton Lakes, New Jersey.\n\nHe attended Northwestern University, where he lived in Elder Hall for his freshman year. He was a 2004 Pro Football Weekly All-American selection, a Second-team All-Big Ten, Academic All-American by ESPN and Second-team Academic All-Big Ten. In 2003, he was a First-team Academic All-District and Academic All-Big Ten. Again, a Second-team Academic All-District by CoSIDA and Academic All-Big Ten in 2002. Castillo finished career with 251 tackles, 4.5 sacks, and 19.5 tackles for loss.\n\nCastillo was selected with the 28th overall pick in the 1st round of the 2005 NFL Draft.\n\nCastillo made headlines at the 2005 NFL Combine when he sent a letter to all 32 NFL teams admitting to using androstenedione, a steroid hormone which increased the amount of testosterone his body produced, promoting muscle growth and healing in an effort to quicken the rehab process of a slow-healing injury so he could perform in all the drills at the 2005 NFL Combine. He claimed he used the steroids in an attempt to fully recover from an elbow injury suffered in the very first game of his senior year at Northwestern. Castillo hyper-extended his elbow, damaging the ulnar collateral ligament, basically preventing him from using one of his arms. Being the team captain, he felt an obligation to fight through the pain and finish the year.\n\nIn an interview with Peter King, Castillo said:\n\"\"So I got shot up before games and just endured the pain,[\"] Castillo told me. \"There were a lot of tough moments. The pain was unbelievable. I had the option of taking a medical redshirt after our third game. I could have come back for a fifth year if I stopped playing then. I could have had surgery, and either come back next year and play again, or maybe make it back in time to work out and get ready for the NFL Draft. But I decided to keep playing. I basically played with one arm. My get-off ability was down. I was falling a lot. I wasn't anywhere near the player I could have been, but I played. At the end of the year, I expected I would have surgery and then come back in six or eight months, but then I saw the Bears' team doctor, and he told me that a lot of football players come back from this injury without having the surgery. So I just started rehabbing and thought I'd be ready for the Combine.\"\"\n\nAfter the urine test came back positive, he and his agent wrote the letters to all the teams admitting use of an illegal substance. Despite this, San Diego Chargers Executive Vice President and General Manager A. J. Smith took a chance on Castillo because of his stellar track record at Northwestern. When asked about Castillo's steroid use, AJ responded, \"Let me tell you -- this is a great kid. Did he cheat to try to get ready for the Combine? All of that is true. He has admitted it. He cheated to cut a corner because he was fearful. But I don't believe he gained an advantage [over what he would have been had he not been hurt]. If we wouldn't have picked him, someone else would have -- because he's proven what a good kid he is and this was a one-time mistake.\"\"\n\nIn 2005 Castillo was named an All-Rookie Team selection by NFL.com, Pro Football Weekly/Professional Football Writers of America. Castillo has emerged as a play maker alongside Jamal Williams and Igor Olshansky, creating havoc in opposing backfields. He ended his rookie season with 49 tackles, 3½ sacks, and 3 pass deflections.\n\nIn the 2006 opening game at the Oakland Raiders ESPN commentator Dick Vermeil called Castillo one of the best young defensive linemen he's seen in a long time. Castillo was a second alternate to the 2006 Pro Bowl. His season totals included playing in 10 games (9 starts) 37 tackles, 7 sacks, and an interception.\n\nOn November 6, 2007, it was announced that Castillo would miss at least 6 weeks after having surgery on one of his knees. For the 2007 season he again played in 10 games and started nine. He totaled 33 tackles, 2½ sacks and one deflected pass. In 2008, following a tackle of Vince Young, Castillo performed a salsa dance for the crowd. Castillo started in all three playoff appearances for the Chargers, including the AFC Championship against the New England Patriots where he sacked Tom Brady.\n\nCastillo signed a five-year, $43.1 million extension in July 2008. His statistics for the season were 16 games played, 15 starts, 39 tackles, 1½ sacks, a pass defensed and an interception (the second of his career).\n\nCastillo started and played 14 games with 2 sacks and 25 total tackles. He led the Chargers into the postseason until losing the divisional round to the New York Jets.\n\nCastillo started all 16 games in 2010 with 2.5 sacks and 26 total tackles.\nDuring Week 1 of the 2011 season, Castillo suffered a broken leg and it prematurely ended his 2011 season. He became a free agent after the season in which he played in only one game.\n\nAfter visiting the New England Patriots, he resigned with the Chargers on a 1-year deal on April 4, 2012.\n\nHowever, Castillo was released by the San Diego Chargers on July 19, 2012.\n\nKey\n\nCastillo is fluent in Spanish. He was born in Brooklyn, New York and moved to the Dominican Republic with his mother, Maria, when he was a child. They returned to the United States when he was 5, and the family settled in New Jersey. Luis returns to the Dominican Republic every offseason where he is revered as a national icon. During his trips to the Dominican, Castillo hosts a youth football clinic and does many community appearances. In 2005, he was honored with the Youth of the Year Award for excellence outside of the Dominican Republic.\n\nCastillo has also emerged as a community leader in San Diego.

In 1967–68, the Comets finished with a 57–5–10 record, making them the only professional team in history to lose only five games or less in a season, and in 1969–70, Kelly was named Minor League Coach of the Year by The Hockey News. Kelly served as head coach and general manager for Charlotte in the Southern Hockey League from 1973–76 guiding the Checkers to a 136–68–12 record, two regular season titles and two postseason titles while earning Coach of the Year honors in the SHL twice.\n\nHe coached the Colorado Rockies in the National Hockey League in 1977–78 and is the only coach in history to lead the Rockies into the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Following coaching stops in the AHL, Kelly went to Peoria in the IHL where he led the Rivermen to the Turner Cup in his first season behind the bench in 1984–85. He recorded his 800th career win on January 4, 1987 and was inducted into the Peoria Sports Hall of Fame in February 1990. Kelly was inducted into the Roanoke Hall of Fame and the Sports Hall of Fame in his hometown of Welland, Ontario in 1998, and in March 2002 he became the first inductee into the Greensboro Hockey Hall of Fame when the Generals retired his uniform number (5).\n\nPat also served as head coach Eastern Hockey League's legendary Clinton Comets, and posted a 315–208–64 (wins-losses-ties) record over eight seasons. During that period, in the 1967–68 season, the Comets produced an awe-inspiring 57–5–10 record.\n\nIn 2008, he was inducted into the ECHL Hall of Fame.\n"}

The Tiger had originally been produced by Grumman American and then later by Gulfstream American with production ending in 1979. The Tiger remained a popular aircraft amongst pilots and owners and American General sought to capitalize on that popularity with the production of new aircraft.\n\nAmerican General actually carried out a redesign of the Tiger, introducing many improvements over the older AA-5B, including a new split nose bowl that could be removed without removing the propeller, a new instrument panel, improved exterior lighting, a new fuel indication system, a 28 volt electrical system replacing the previous 12 volt system, a new style throttle quadrant and improvements to the heat and ventilation systems. These were enough changes that the FAA required an amended type certificate. This added to the time required to get the aircraft into production and the cost of doing so. The redesigned aircraft was known as the American General AG-5B Tiger.\n\nThe newly redesigned aircraft was well received by the civil aviation community. Many aircraft reviewers at that time wrote that the AG-5B was an evolutionary improvement over the previous production AA-5B Tigers and a worthy successor.\n\nThe company commenced production with the 1990 model year, building 13 production aircraft that year. 87 aircraft were produced in 1991 and 54 in 1992. The final year of production was 1992 when 24 were produced before the company closed its doors.

White currently sings for La Paz and Michael Schenker Fest. He has also notably sung for Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force, Praying Mantis and Tank. White auditioned for Iron Maiden in 1993, following the departure of their vocalist Bruce Dickinson, but ultimately lost out to Blaze Bayley.\n\nWhite was born in Motherwell. He formed La Paz with guitarist Chic McSherry in 1984, playing around Scotland for four years and releasing two albums on cassette, before in 1988 joining melodic rock combo Midnight Blue, cutting one album (released on Zero Records exclusively in Japan).\n\nA trip to Japan in 1991 singing with Praying Mantis in a NWOBHM revival tour followed.\n\nAfter a demo tape forwarded to Ritchie Blackmore's management a few years earlier sat in a box for a few years, Candice Night discovered it and presented it to Blackmore when he was looking for singers to audition for Rainbow. Consequently, White was asked to audition for Rainbow, subsequently joining the band in 1994. He had also auditioned for metal bands Pink Cream 69 and Iron Maiden, losing out to Wolfsbane's Blaze Bayley.\n\nTo indicate how quickly his fortunes had changed in the year since meeting Blackmore, when Rainbow played the Labbatt's Apollo in Hammersmith, London in November 1995, he joked with the audience that the last time he was at the venue only a few years before, he was selling hotdogs in the lobby.\n\nJust before the Rainbow job, White had been busy laying down tracks with Cozy Powell and Neil Murray for a solo Powell project.\n\nAfter the end of the Rainbow in 1997, he then worked with former Midnight Blue guitarist Alex Dickson with the intention of securing a solo deal. Sessions on several tribute releases were next, the Whitesnake tribute \"Snakebites\" (2000), and several tracks included on \"666 Number of the Beast\" (2004) a two-volume tribute to Iron Maiden out on Deadline. White also guested on Nikolo Kotzev's conceptual \"Nostradamus\" 2001 release.\n\nA contribution to Royal Hunt bassist Steen Morgensen's solo project \"Arrival\" (under the moniker Cornerstone) was released in late 2000.

White also joined Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force, touring through South America in late 2001, while \"Attack\" (2002) was White's first studio effort with the Swede.\n\n\"Once Upon Our Yesterdays\" (2003) was the next Cornerstone album, and a set of dates for the band across Europe marked their live debut. In 2003, White was once again hired by Praying Mantis to provide vocals for half of the songs of their album \"The Journey Goes On\".\n\nIn 2005, White fronted another Malmsteen opus, titled \"Unleash the Fury\". In this year, he also recorded an album with guitarist Bill Liesegang under the Liesegang/White moniker. He also put together a part-time band with Mostly Autumn personnel monikered White Noise. A DVD from their support stint in the UK with Uriah Heep featured a live airing of \"Tarot Woman\" as well as other Rainbow tracks.\n\nIn 2007, the fourth Cornerstone album, \"Two Tales of One Tomorrow\" was released. Later the same year, White replaced Tony Martin as the frontman of the German band Empire. Empire released their fourth album \"Chasing Shadows\" in November, with White handling all vocal duties.

Tank's first album with White as lead singer is titled \"War Machine\" and was released in October 2010. In 2009, White was performing with La Paz again, as well as Tank. He has also recorded the vocals for an English version of the latest album by Argentinian rockers Rata Blanca.\n\nHe performed with Jon Lord twice, stepping in for Lord's regular singer Steve Balsamo. On 1 September 2009, White sang vocal parts in Lord's \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" at the opening night of the Fall Arts Fest in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

{"id": "1888283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888283", "title": "The Frog Princess", "text": "The Frog Princess\n\nThe Frog Princess is a fairy tale that has multiple versions with various origins. It is classified as type 402, the animal bride, in the Aarne–Thompson index. Another tale of this type is \"Doll i' the Grass\".\n\nRussian variants include the \"Frog Princess\" or \"Tsarevna Frog\" (\"Царевна Лягушка\", \"Tsarevna Lyagushka\") and also Vasilisa the Wise (\"Василиса Премудрая\", \"Vasilisa Premudraya\"); Alexander Afanasyev collected variants in his \"Narodnye russkie skazki\". Andrew Lang included an Italian variant titled The Frog in \"The Violet Fairy Book\". Italo Calvino included another Italian variant from Piedmont, The Prince Who Married a Frog, in \"Italian Folktales\", where he noted that the tale was common throughout Europe. Georgios A. Megas included a Greek variant, The Enchanted Lake, in \"Folktales of Greece\".\n\nThe king (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a frog. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to-be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess.\n\nIn Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.\nIn the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocratic and wealthy merchant. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled girl who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying Koschei. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with Baba Yaga, whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a bird. The prince catches her, she turns into a lizard, and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the third sister, he catches her and no transformations can break her free again.\n\nIn some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along.\n\nThis tale is closely related to \"Puddocky\" and its variants, in which a king sets three tasks to his sons to determine which is best suited to rule the country, and a transformed frog helps the youngest prince.\n\n\nMusic\n\nThe Divine Comedy's 1997 single The Frog Princess is loosely based on the theme of the original Frog Princess story, interwoven with the narrator's personal experiences.\n\n"}

Located in the Semien (North) Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, its territory covers the Semien Mountains and includes Ras Dashan, the highest point in Ethiopia.\nIt is home to a number of endangered species, including the Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, a wild goat found nowhere else in the world. The gelada baboon and the caracal, a cat, also occur within the Simien Mountains. More than 50 species of birds inhabit the park, including the impressive bearded vulture, or lammergeier, with its ) wingspan.\n\nThe park is crossed by an unpaved road which runs from Debarq, where the administrative headquarters of the park is located, east through a number of villages to the Buahit Pass (4,430 m), where the road turns south to end at Mekane Berhan, 10 kilometers beyond the park boundary.\n\nThe park was established in 1969, having been set up by Clive Nicol, who wrote about his experiences in \"From the Roof of Africa\" (1971, ).\n\nThe Simien region has been inhabited and cultivated for at least 2,000 years. Initially, erosion began to reveal that the clearing began at the gentle slope of the highland valley but later expanded to a steep slope.\n\nIt was one of the first sites to be made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (1978). However, due to serious population declines of some of its characteristic native species, in 1996 it was also added to the List of World Heritage in Danger.\n\nOver millions of years, due to the large erosion of the Ethiopian plateau, serrated mountain peaks, deep valleys, and 1,500 meters of sheer cliffs have been created, making it one of the most spectacular scenery in the world.\n\nThe heritage area is on the western side of the Simien Mountains and is 120 km from the Gondar province of Begemder in the northwestern part of Ethiopia. The Simien area is rich in perforated basalt, and serves as an ideal catchment basin. Water is reserved by the Mayshasha River, which runs through the two rainy days and the national park from north to south. As a result, national parks are abundant with wildlife and plants.\n\nThe vegetation is mixed with African alpine forests, wilderness forests and alpine vegetation. High altitude areas include montane savannah and tree heath (\"Erica arborea\"), giant lobelia (\"Lobelia rhynchopetalum\"), yellow primrose (\"Primula verticillata\"), everlastings (\"Helichrysum\" spp.), A lady's mantle (alchemilla), and a moss (mosses, Grimmiaceae). Lichen covers the trees of the alpine area. Vegetation throughout the park is divided into three sections, Montane forest (1900-3000m), Ericaceous Belt or SubAfroalpine (2700-3700m) and the Afroalpine (3700-5433m). Within the Montane forest there are Juniper trees (\"Juniperous procera\"), African Redwood (\"Hagenia abyssinica),\" African Olive (\"Olea africana),\" Fig Trees (\"Ficus spp),\" and Waterberry Trees (\"Szygium guineense).\" There are also many varieties of shrubs including Nightshade (\"Solanum sessilistellatum\"), Abyssinian rose (\"Rosa abyssinica),\" Cowslip (\"primula verticillata\"), and Stinging Nettle (\"Urtica\"). The ridges and canyons have scattered meadows, forests and bushes. At one time, the St. John's wort (\"Hypericum\" spp.) Forests grew from 3,000 m to 3,800 m above sea level, but now it is almost gone. The exact number is not known.\n\nThe park is populated with over 130 bird species and over 20 large mammal species such as gelada baboon (\"Theropithecus gelada\"), Ethiopian wolf (also called Simen fox, \"Canis simensis\"), Walia ibex (\"Capra walie\"), wild mountain goats and the Anubis baboon. Inhabits on the slope of the northern slope of massif are mostly native to the Semien Mountains, and most of them are found in the park. The Ethiopian wolf is endemic to Ethiopia and other mammals include hamadryas baboon, colobus monkey, leopard, caracal, wild cat, spotted hyena and golden jackal. There are also large herbivores, such as bushbuck, common duiker, and klipspringer.\n\nThe 400 species of birds include lammergeyer, Verreaux's eagle, kestrels, vultures, lanner falcon (\"Falco biarmicus\"), African buzzard (augur buzzard) and thick-billed raven. A total of 21 species of mammals, 3 species of endemic species, 63 species of birds and 7 species of endemic species are recorded.\n\nIt was established as a national park in 1969 and is protected under the National Reserve Act. Current heritage requires effective management. The number of management staff should be increased and education should be strengthened. The management of national parks effectively protects the representative species of parks and works closely with local residents to reduce the pressure on park resources by expanding arable land, overfishing livestock, and overcapacity of natural resources. Due to global climate change, pressure on heritage sites is growing.\n\nSufficient financial support is needed for park management and livelihood alternative development of local residents. It is necessary to prepare, implement, review and monitor the management plan, to revise and expand the boundary of the park, and to participate fully in the local residents. Local cooperation is particularly important to prevent sustainable use of national park resources and to develop sustainable livelihoods. Adequate financial support for resettlement of inhabitants in the heritage area and the introduction of effective livestock management are essential to reduce the severe stress on wildlife.\n\nIn order to maintain excellent universal values, environmental education and training programs of residents living in and out of the heritage are needed as well as obtaining the cooperation and support of local residents in heritage management.\n\n"}

{"id": "1888296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888296", "title": "Peter Zezel", "text": "Peter Zezel\n\nPeter Zezel (April 22, 1965 – May 26, 2009) was a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who spent 15 seasons in the National Hockey League from 1984 to 1999. He was born and raised in Scarborough, Ontario.\n\nZezel was selected 41st overall in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft by the Philadelphia Flyers. While he joined the NHL as a skilled offensive player and put up high scoring numbers in his first eight seasons, he spent the second half of his career primarily as a defensive specialist noted for his strong faceoff skills.\n\nZezel joined the Flyers' lineup in the 1984–85 at the age of 19 and made an instant impact, finishing fifth in rookie scoring with 61 points and setting a team record 46 assists by a rookie. He was part of a young Flyer team (with eight regulars under the age of 22, and only Mark Howe over the age of 27) which surprised the hockey world by reaching the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers. The Flyers' head coach at the time was Mike Keenan, who became one of Zezel's biggest influences, and who would re-acquire Zezel several times later in their careers.\n\nAfter a 54-point sophomore campaign, Zezel had his best year in 1986–87, registering career highs of 33 goals and 72 points (despite missing nine games to injury) while continuing to impress with his mature all-around game. That spring, he would again help the Flyers to the Stanley Cup Finals, registering 13 points before the team was again bested by the Oilers.\n\nThe Flyers dealt Zezel to the St. Louis Blues midway through the 1988–89 in exchange for Mike Bullard. Zezel played some of the best hockey of his career for the Blues, finishing the season with a career high 49 assists and 70 points. In the playoffs that year, he led the Blues with 6 goals and 12 points in just 10 games. In 1989–90, he had another fine season, posting 25 goals and 72 points.\n\nIn 1990, St. Louis dealt him to the Washington Capitals for Geoff Courtnall. His stay in Washington was brief, as he appeared in only 20 games before being dealt to his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs in a deal for Al Iafrate. He finished the 1990–91 season with 40 points in 52 games due to injury. In 1991–92, he recorded 49 points in 64 games in another year hampered by injury.\n\nThe hiring of Pat Burns as the Maple Leafs' head coach in 1992 represented a turning point in Zezel's career. While he had previously always been given a great deal of offensive responsibility, the defensive-minded Burns employed Zezel almost exclusively as a checking line center, and his numbers plummeted. Additionally, he continued to be plagued by injuries, missing half the 1993–94 season with an ongoing back problems that had bothered him for several years. However, when healthy he was still an effective player, and helped Toronto reach the Western Conference Finals in both 1993 and 1994, including a Game 1 overtime winner in 1994.\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Zezel was awarded to the Dallas Stars as compensation for the Leafs' signing of free agent Mike Craig. His one season in Dallas was a disappointment, as he was limited to just 30 games and 11 points by a knee injury. For 1995–96, he was signed by the St. Louis Blues and his old coach Keenan.\n\nDealt to the New Jersey Devils in 1997, his career hit a low point in the 1997–98 campaign when he was sent to the minors for the first time in his career. He performed well in the AHL with 50 points in 35 games for the Albany River Rats. Keenan, who was now coaching in Vancouver at the time, had Zezel acquired by the Canucks in February 1998. There, Zezel was given a chance to contribute offensively alongside star winger Alexander Mogilny, and he responded with 17 points in 25 games, including a goal on his first shift as a Canuck.\n\nZezel's career ended abruptly at the trade deadline late in the 1998–99 season. Zezel's niece Jilliann was terminally ill with cancer in Toronto and he requested a trade from the Canucks (who were far out of the playoff race) to an Eastern Conference (NHL) team so he could be closer to his family. Instead, Vancouver General Manager Brian Burke dealt him to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, the furthest stop from Toronto in the league. Zezel retired from the NHL and returned home, with Burke and Canucks' management receiving criticism from a media and public sympathetic to Zezel's situation and for the callous way they thought he was treated. Burke had the Canucks buy out the remainder of Zezel's contract ($110,000) and made a charitable donation in the same amount, to an organization the Canucks supported for terminally ill children.\n\nHe finished his career playing 873 games, scoring 219 goals and 389 assists, with a total of 608 points.\n\nZezel was an impressive soccer player in his youth. Although eventually choosing to concentrate on hockey, during off seasons early in his career, he continued to play competitively. Zezel was drafted by the Toronto Blizzard of the North American Soccer League, and appeared as striker in three exhibition games for them in 1982. He never appeared in an official NASL game. In 1984, he played in the National Soccer League with Toronto Italia. During the summer of 1991 he played for the North York Rockets of the Canadian Soccer League.\n\nIn May 2010, the Soccer Hall of Fame & Museum Board of Governors selected Zezel as the first recipient of the Brian Budd Award. Peter's father (Peter Sr.) was an accomplished soccer player for the Serbian White Eagles FC. Peter played his youth soccer for Wexford Soccer Club.\n\nThe skills he honed during his years on the pitch helped him on the ice. His soccer background made him a very strong player along the boards, and one of the best face-off men in the NHL.

The camps teach and improve the hockey and soccer skills of young players from the ages of 5 to 14 years.\n\nIn October 2001, Zezel almost died of the rare blood disorder that eventually claimed his life: hemolytic anemia. At the time he made a full recovery, but in 2009 his condition worsened and he was \"close to death\". Zezel underwent chemotherapy and had his spleen removed as part of his treatment.\n\nShortly after his splenectomy, Zezel began complaining of serious headaches. Roughly 12 hours later, he once again underwent surgery, during which time surgeons had found hemorrhaging in his brain. He slowly lapsed into a coma, and was placed on life-support once his organs began to fail. Because Zezel wanted to donate his organs, his family made the decision to remove him from life support that the organs might be preserved. Zezel died on May 26, 2009, with the service taking place at the St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Mississauga. Zezel never married and had no children.\n\nIn July 2014, a street in a new development in Scarborough was named Zezel Way to honour Zezel.\n\n"}

Ross\n\nSir William David Ross (15 April 1877 – 5 May 1971), known as David Ross but usually cited as W. D. Ross, was a Scottish philosopher who is known for his work in ethics. His best-known work is \"The Right and the Good\" (1930), and he is perhaps best known for developing a pluralist, deontological form of intuitionist ethics in response to G. E. Moore's consequentialist form of intuitionism. Ross also , in addition to writing on Greek philosophy.\n\nHis accomplishments include his work with John Alexander Smith on a 12-volume translation of Aristotle.\n\nWilliam David Ross was born in Thurso, Caithness in the north of Scotland the son of John Ross (1835-1905).\n\nHe spent most of his first six years as a child in southern India. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1895, he gained a first class MA degree in classics. He completed his studies at Balliol College, Oxford, with a First in Classical Moderations in 1898 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats', a combination of philosophy and ancient history) in 1900. He was appointed to a lectureship at Merton College in 1900, and elected to a tutorial fellowship at Oriel College in October 1902.\n\nRoss joined the army in 1915. During World War I, he worked in the Ministry of Munitions and was a major on the special list. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918 in recognition of his services during the war, and was promoted to a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1938.\n\nRoss was White's Professor of Moral Philosophy (1923–1928), Provost of Oriel College, Oxford (1929–1947), Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1941 to 1944 and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (1944–1947). He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1939 to 1940. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy and was its President 1940–1944. Of the many governmental committees on which he served one was the Civil Service Tribunal, of which he was chair. One of his two colleagues was Leonard Woolf, who thought that the whole system of fixing governmental remuneration should be on the same basis as the US model, dividing the civil service into a relatively small number of pay grades. Ross did not agree with this radical proposal. In 1947 he was appointed chairman of the first Royal Commission on the Press, United Kingdom.\nHe died in Oxford on 5 May 1971. He is memorialised on his parents grave in the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh.\n\nHis younger brother was Rev Donald George Ross (1879-1943).\n\nHe married Edith Ogden in 1906 and they had four daughters, Margaret (who married Robin Harrison), Eleanor, Rosalind (who married John Miller Martin), and Katharine. Edith died in 1953.\n\nHe was a cousin of Berriedale Keith.\n\nW. D. Ross was a moral realist, a non-naturalist, and an intuitionist. He argued that there are moral truths. He wrote:\n\nThe moral order...is just as much part of the fundamental nature of the universe (and...of any possible universe in which there are moral agents at all) as is the spatial or numerical structure expressed in the axioms of geometry or arithmetic.\n\nThus, according to Ross, the claim that something is good is true if that thing really is good. Ross also agreed with G.E. Moore's claim that any attempt to define ethical statements solely in terms of statements about the natural world commits the naturalistic fallacy.\n\nRoss rejected Moore's consequentialist ethics. According to consequentialist theories, what people ought to do is determined only by whether their actions will bring about the most good. By contrast, Ross argues that maximising the good is only one of several \"prima facie\" duties (prima facie obligations) which play a role in determining what a person ought to do in any given case.\n\nIn \"The Right and the Good,\" Ross lists seven \"prima facie\" duties, without claiming his list to be all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; justice; beneficence; non-maleficence; and self-improvement. In any given situation, any number of these prima facie duties may apply. In the case of ethical dilemmas, they may even contradict one another. Someone could have a prima facie duty of reparation, say, a duty to help people who helped you move house, move house themselves, and a prima facie duty of fidelity, such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict. Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the prima facie duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the \"absolute obligation\" or \"absolute duty\", the action that the person ought to perform.\n\nIt is frequently argued, however, that Ross should have used the term \"pro tanto\" rather than \"prima facie\". Shelly Kagan, for example, wrote:\n\nExplaining the difference between pro tanto and prima facie, Kagan wrote: \"A pro tanto reason has genuine weight, but nonetheless may be outweighed by other considerations. Thus, calling a reason a pro tanto reason is to be distinguished from calling it a prima facie reason, which I take to involve an epistemological qualification: a prima facie reason appears to be a reason, but may actually not be a reason at all\".\n\nA frequent criticism of Ross's ethics is that it is unsystematic and often fails to provide clear-cut ethical answers. Another is that \"moral intuitions\" are not a reliable basis for ethics, because they are fallible, can vary widely from individual to individual, and are often rooted in our evolutionary past in ways that should make us suspicious of their capacity to track moral truth.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1888300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888300", "title": "Hero of Belarus", "text": "Hero of Belarus\n\nHero of Belarus (, \"Hieroj Biełarusi\"; ) is the highest title that can be bestowed on a citizen of Belarus. The title is awarded to those \"who perform great deeds in the name of freedom, independence and prosperity of the Republic of Belarus\". The deed can be for military performance, economic performance or great service to the State and society. The design of the medal is similar to that of its predecessor, Hero of the Soviet Union. Similar titles to the Hero of Belarus include the Hero of the Russian Federation, Hero of Ukraine, and Hero of Uzbekistan. Since its creation, the title has been awarded to eleven people.\n\nThe title and other Belarusian state awards, their creation, nomination and awarding, are regulated by a set of legal documents: Belarusian Constitution, Law N 288-З \"About state awards of the Republic of Belarus\" and presidential decrees.\n\nThe title was created by the Belarus Supreme Soviet on April 13, 1995, with the passage of Resolution N 3726-XII, titled \"System of State Awards for the Republic of Belarus\". Alongside the Hero of Belarus title, the resolution authorized the creation of medals, orders, and titles that can be presented by the Belarusian government. The creation of the awards was a way to honor those who have made valuable contributions to Belarus, irrespective of whether they were performed by a citizen or a foreigner.\n\nThis resolution was outlawed and replaced by Law N 288-З on May 18, 2004.\n\nTo be considered for title, a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large. The title can be awarded to those serving in the military, public service or private enterprise. It can only be awarded once to an individual, and can be awarded posthumously. The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2, Article 5 of Law N 288-З. Chapter 3, Article 60 of Law N 288-З allows any group (association) of workers to submit a recommendation (petition) for an individual to be awarded the title. Governmental bodies, the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, cabinet officials and public unions, among others, are also eligible to submit nominations for the title. The candidate is evaluated, and if deemed worthy, the nomination is forwarded to the Council of Ministers and then, after having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the Belarusian Security Council, to the President of the Republic.\n\nUnder the Belarus Constitution (Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 84), the President of the Republic has the power to bestow state awards. To announce an award, the President issues a decree conferring the title to a person. Within two months, the title will be presented by the President in a formal setting, usually at the Independence Palace in the capital city of Minsk. A certificate (\"gramota\") will also be presented to the recipient, signed by the President of the Republic.\n\nInitially, social privileges for those, who achieved Hero of Belarus, according to the Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under April 13, 1995 N 3727-XII, were equal to the privileges for people, whom Hero of Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labour, Order of Glory or Order of Labor Glory was given. These privileges are regulated by Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under February 21, 1995 N 3599-XII.\n\nNow this question is regulated by Law of the Republic of Belarus under June 14, 2007 N 239-З \"About social privileges, rights and guarantees to a definite category of citizens\".\n\nAccording to it, Heroes of Belarus have rights:\nThe consumptions, connected with these privileges, are financed from means of republican and local budgets and of governmental social insurance.\n\nThe recipient of the title is given a medal called the Medal of the Hero of Belarus (Belarusian: медаль Героя Беларусі, Russian: медаль Героя Беларуси). The star and suspension are made of gold, and thus it is nicknamed \"Gold Star\", as was its predecessor, the Hero of the Soviet Union. The star has a total diameter of 33 millimeters, and is attached to a rectangular suspension device (boot tree). In the center of the rectangle is a ribbon of two sections of red and one section of green. The red and green bars on the ribbon evoke the design and colors of the national flag. The amount of gold is set at 585–1 Test, with the total weight of the medal being 19 grams. The present design was enacted into law by Presidential Decree Number 516 on September 6, 1999.\n\nThe design of the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labor and the Hero of the Russian Federation titles, there is no engraving on the reverse of the star. The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also used to make the ribbon of that medal. The medal is always worn in full on the left side of the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.\n\nWhen the title was created, a suggested medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is the design of the suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.\n\nThe first award in history was given to Uladzimir Karvat (posthumous) in 1996. The first \"group awarding\" took place on June 30, 2001 to Pavel Mariev, Mikhail Karchmit, Vital Kramko and Alaksandar Dubko (posthumous), while Kirill Vakhromeev, Mikhail Savicki, Mikhail Vysotsky, Pyotr Prakapovich and Vasily Revyako were presented their titles on March 1, 2006.\n\nUladzimir Karvat, a military pilot, was flying his training aircraft Sukhoi Su-27p on May 23, 1996. The plane caught fire and Karvat was ordered to eject to safety. Unknown to the ground crew, the plane would have crashed in an area full of civilians. Seeing the civilians on the ground, Karvat steered the plane away until it crashed one kilometer from the Brest Voblast settlements of Arabawshchyna and Vyalikaye Hatsishcha, killing him instantly. President Alexander Lukashenko issued Decree Number 484 on November 21, 1996, which posthumously awarded Karvat the title Hero of Belarus. The crash site has been converted to a memorial for Karvat, where a copy of Lukashenko's decree is on the tail fin of the Sukhoi Su-27p.\n\nPavel Mariev was awarded the title for his work in the automobile industry as manager of Belarusian Auto Works, a leading producer of Belarusian automobiles.\n\nVital Kramko and Mikhail Karchmit were awarded for their work in the agriculture industry. Kramko is the chairman of the Hrodna Voblast agricultural collective \"October\", while Karchmit was the director of the Minsk Voblast cooperative \"Snov\" until his death in 2004.\n\nAlaksandar Dubko was posthumously awarded the hero title for his long service to the Belarusian and Soviet governments.\n\nKirill Vakhromeev, the emeritus Metropolitan of Minsk and Slutsk, the Patriarchal Exarch of All Belarus, was awarded the hero title for his work to restore spirituality among the Belarusian population.\n\nMikhail Savicki was awarded the hero title for his long contributions to the Belarusian arts and for helping to set up art academies in the republic.\n\nMikhail Vysotsky was awarded for running the research enterprise \"Belavtotraktorostroyeniye\", a part of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nPyotr Prakapovich was awarded for his work as the chairman of the National Bank of Belarus.\n\nVasily Revyako was awarded for his work at the Hrodna Voblast agricultural co-op \"Progress-Vertelishki\".\n\nDarya Domracheva was awarded for her progress in biathlon after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where Darya won 3 gold medal in personal starts.\n\nThe medal was featured on a stamp, released by Belposhta, commemorating the 3rd year of Karvat's death. Designed by V. Volynets, the 25,000 rouble stamp featured the medal on the left and Karvat's photo on the right in full color. In the white text below the medal, it says \"Hero of Belarus, Uładzimir Mikalaevič Karvat, (28.11.1958 – 23.05.1996)\". It was issued on August 12, 1999, and had a print run of 90,000.\n\nThe hero title was also featured in a set of stamps released by BELPOST in December 2006, depicting the state awards of Belarus. On the first issue card, the medal is displayed in full color next to drawings of the state emblem, state flag and the Presidential Palace. A first day postal marking from Minsk also uses an outline of the medal, which is adorned with wreaths and the text \"National Decorations of the Republic of Belarus\" written in the Belarusian language.\n\nAnother set of stamps, devoted to orders and medals of Belarus, was put into circulation by Ministry of Communications and Informatization of Belarus in August 2008. The designers are Ivan Lukin and Oleg Gaiko. The printing is offset and full-color. Paper is chalk-overly and rubberized. The size of stamps are 29,6 × 52 mm.\n\nTelevision channel \"CTV (Minsk)\" released a film, devoted to the Heroes of Belarus.\n\n\n"}

This commonly results from the sufferer frequently wearing their hair in a particularly tight ponytail, pigtails, or braids. It is also seen occasionally in long-haired people who use barrettes to keep hair out of their faces. Traction alopecia is recession of the hairline due to chronic traction, or hair pulling, and is characterized by a fringe along the marginal hairline on physical exam. Even though this \"fringe sign\" is considered a useful clinical marker of this condition, cases of frontal fibrosing alopecia presenting with an unusual retention of the hairline (pseudo-fringe sign) have been described.\n\nIt is commonly seen with certain hair styles or braiding patterns that pull the hairline forcefully towards the vertex of the scalp, and has been reported more often in African American women (as some wear their hair tightly pulled back), in whom it can cause scarring. It has also been seen in female ballerinas, and in cultural traditions where the hair is voluntarily not cut in religious obeisance, the latter caused by progressively increasing weight of the hair itself. Traction alopecia is mechanical in cause, rather than androgenic, and treatment is typically not pharmaceutical. Management includes cessation of the chronic traction, cosmeses, with surgical restoration reserved for more severe cases.\n\nTraction alopecia is a substantial risk in hair weaves, which can be worn either to conceal hair loss, or purely for cosmetic purposes. The former involves creating a braid around the head below the existing hairline, to which an extended-wear hairpiece, or wig, is attached. Since the hair of the braid is still growing, it requires frequent maintenance, which involves the hairpiece being removed, the natural hair braided again, and the piece snugly reattached. The tight braiding and snug hairpiece cause tension on the hair that is already at risk for falling out. Traction Alopecia is one of the most common causes of hair loss in African American women. \nSikh men are also susceptible to traction alopecia if the hair under the turban is tied too tightly for many years.\n\nOther causes include:\n\n"}

On the other hand, the \"American Book Review\" ranked it as No. 22 on its \"Best first lines from novels\" list.\n\nIn 2008, Henry Lytton-Cobbold, a descendant of Bulwer-Lytton, participated in a debate in the town of Lytton, British Columbia with Scott Rice, the founder of the International Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. Rice accused Bulwer-Lytton of writing \"27 novels whose perfervid turgidity I intend to expose, denude, and generally make visible.\" Lytton-Cobbold defended his ancestor, noting that he had coined many other phrases widely used today such as \"the pen is mightier than the sword\", \"the great unwashed\", and \"the almighty dollar\". He said that it was \"rather unfair that Professor Rice decided to name the competition after him for entirely the wrong reasons.\"\n\nThe \"Peanuts\" comic strip character Snoopy, in his imagined persona as the World Famous Author, sometimes begins his novels with the phrase \"It was a dark and stormy night.\" Cartoonist Charles Schulz made Snoopy use this phrase because \"it was a cliché, and had been one for a very long time\". A book by Schulz, titled \"It Was a Dark and Stormy Night, Snoopy,\" and credited to Snoopy as author, was published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1971.\n\nJanet and Allan Ahlberg wrote a book titled \"It Was A Dark and Stormy Night\" in which a kidnapped child must keep his captors entertained with his storytelling.\n\nIt is the opening line in the popular 1962 novel \"A Wrinkle in Time\" by Madeleine L'Engle:\n\nL'Engle biographer Leonard Marcus notes that \"With a wink to the reader, she chose for the opening line of \"A Wrinkle in Time\", her most audaciously original work of fiction, that hoariest of cliches ...

In the December 1998 issue of \"Musician\", Mitchell discusses her idea of using several cliche lines in the lyrics of multiple songs on the album, such as \"the old man is snoring\" in the title song \"Taming the Tiger\". Her co-lyricist, Don Fried, had read of a competition in \"The New Yorker\" to write a story opening with \"It was a dark and stormy night\" and was inspired to put it in the song lyrics.

{"id": "1888316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888316", "title": "Latin Rights", "text": "Latin Rights\n\nAll the \"Latini\" of Italy obtained Roman citizenship as a result of three laws which were introduced during the Social War between the Romans and their allies among the Italic peoples (\"socii\") which rebelled against Rome. The \"Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis (et sociis) Danda\" of 90 BC conferred Roman citizenship on all citizens of the Latin towns and the Italic towns who had not rebelled. The \"Lex Plautia Papiria de Civitate Sociis Danda\" of 89 BC granted Roman citizenship to all federated towns in Italy south of the River Po (in northern Italy). The \"Lex Pompeia de Transpadanis\" of 89 BC granted the \"ius Latii\" to the communities of Transpadania, a region north of the Po, which had sided with Rome during the Social War. It also granted Roman citizenship to those who became officials in their respective \"municipia\" (cities). \n\nThe exact content of the \"ius Latii\", under Roman law, varied from city to city. It could include some or all of the following rights:\n\n\nOutside of Italy, the term \"Latinitas\" continued to be used for other cases. Cicero used this term in relation to Julius Caesar's grant of Latin rights to the Sicilians in 44 BC. This use of \"\"ius Latii\"\" or \"\"Latinitas\"\" persisted to the reign of Emperor Justinian I in the sixth century AD. This status was later given to whole towns and regions: Emperor Vespasian granted it to the whole of Hispania and Emperor Hadrian gave it to many towns.\n\nRome was one of the many Latin cities of Italy. From 340 to 338 BC the Latin League, a confederation of circa 30 towns in Latium (land of the Latins) which was allied with Rome, rebelled in what has been called the Latin War. The Romans won the war and dissolved the Latin League. Many of the city-states of Latium were fully incorporated into the Roman Republic, while others were given limited rights and privileges which could be exercised in dealings with Roman citizens. These came to be known as \"ius Latii\". The \"ius Latii\" was given to some Roman colonies which were founded around Italy in the fourth and third centuries BC to strengthen Roman control, as Rome expanded its hegemony over the peninsula. They were colonies which were given Latin legal status, and their settlers the \"ius Latii\", instead of the Roman legal status of other colonies whose settlers were given Roman citizenship. Colonies of Latin status were called \"Latin colonies\" and those of Roman status were called \"Roman colonies\". Roman citizens who settled in a Latin colony lost their Roman citizenship and acquired \"ius Latii\". Latin colonies were usually smaller than Roman colonies.\n\nWith Roman expansion beyond Italy, Latin colonies were also founded outside Italy, e. g. Carteia (contemporary San Roque), which was founded in Hispania in 171 BC and was the first Latin colony outside of Italy. In 122 BC, the plebeian tribune Gaius Gracchus introduced a law which extended the \"ius Latii\" to all other residents of Italy. This reflected the increasing ties between Rome and the Italic peoples through trade and the ties between the leading families in the Italian towns and patrician families in Rome. In 44 BC, Julius Caesar granted the \"ius Latii\" to all free-born Sicilians.\n\nFollowing the great spate of colonial settlements under Julius Caesar and Augustus, the \"ius Latii\" was used more as a political instrument that aimed at integration of provincial communities via their local leadership. Latin status included the acquisition of Roman citizenship upon the holding of municipal magistracy (\"ius adipiscendae civitatis per magistratum\"), which presumed a trajectory of development that would carry at least the local magistrates along the path to the institution of a Roman-style community. In AD 123, Emperor Hadrian made a key modification to Latin rights. He introduced \"\"Latium maius\"\" (\"greater Latin [rights]\"), which conferred Roman citizenship on all the decurions of a town as opposed to \"\"Latium minus\"\", which conferred it only on those who held a magistracy.\n\nThe acquisition of \"ius Latii\" was wholly dependent on imperial gift. This beneficence could span the whole range from grants to individuals to awards made to whole towns, and could even be applied to an entire population, as when Emperor Vespasian gave the \"ius Latii\" to all of Hispania in AD 74. Although this decree could encompass whole cities, it is important to note that it did not necessarily entail the establishment of a municipium (self-governing town). Often, as in Hispania, formal \"municipia\" might have been constituted several years after the initial grant.\n\n\n"}

The school had initially hoped to expand onto the Gabel school property, but lost it to eminent domain.

The Middle School fields teams of soccer, volleyball, cross-country, basketball, and track. The Upper School competes in soccer, cross-country, basketball, baseball, track, golf, swimming, skiing, women's volleyball, and tennis.\n\nBeginning in 2017, several former students began writing about sexual abuse by faculty on social media. Coinciding with the Me Too movement, the number of accounts increased, prompting the school to commission an investigation in October 2019.\n\nThe investigation issues a report on November 11, 2019. It found that at least 21 Catlin Gabel faculty had taken advantage of their positions at the school in committing various degrees of sexual impropriety. This ranged from the rape of a 6th grade minor to generally inappropriate behavior and relationships between faculty and students that went back as early as the 1960s and was recorded occurring as recently as 2016. In December 2019, the Washington County Sheriff's Department opened a criminal investigation of the school. In 2020, \"The Oregonian\" documented allegations by over 15 former students from age 21 to 61.\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball for the Florida Marlins, New York Mets, and Minnesota Twins from 1996 through 2010.\n\nCastillo is a three-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glove winner, and won the World Series with the Marlins in 2003. He is also the only player who played for the Marlins in both of their World Series winning seasons who did not get traded in between the two seasons.\n\nOn August 19, 1992, Castillo was signed as a non-drafted free agent by the Florida Marlins. In 1994, he played his first year of baseball in the Gulf Coast League, playing for the Gulf Coast Marlins. He also set a Marlins short-season record in stolen bases, with 31.\n\nIn 1995, he was called up to the Kane County Cougars in the Class-A Midwest League, and was selected to the All-Star team. He injured his shoulder in July, causing him to miss the rest of the season. That year, he led the entire Marlins organization in batting average with .326, as well as being second in stolen bases.\n\nCastillo spent most of the 1996 season in the Eastern League, but was called up to the Marlins mid-season and made his major league debut on August 8. His first major league hit came in a game against the New York Mets, where he knocked in the game-winning run in the 10th inning. He was named to the Eastern League All-Star team and post-season All-Star team.\n\nCastillo started playing full-time for the Marlins at second base during the 1997 season. Both at age 21, he and Édgar Rentería were the youngest middle infield combination in the history of the National League. He bruised his left heel mid-season, and missed the entire month of May with the injury. He was optioned to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights on July 28 and did not come back to the major leagues until the next season. Due to this, he did not play for the Marlins during the 1997 World Series.\n\nCastillo remained with the Charlotte Knights until being recalled to the Marlins on August 4, 1998. While in Charlotte, he had a streak of 32 consecutive games reaching base safely. With the Marlins, his highest hit streak was eight games, between August 14 and 19. By the end of the season, he was third among Marlins minor leaguers in stolen bases, and a .203 batting average, 3 stolen bases and 10 RBIs.\n\nCastillo improved in 1999, with many short hitting streaks. These streaks included six games from May 10 to 17, and six games from August 1 to 7. He also had a 22-game hitting streak in a stretch between August 9 and September 3. He finished fourth in the league in stolen bases, and was fourth among leadoff hitters in on-base percentage at .385. He was named the Marlins Most Valuable Player by the South Florida Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.\n\nCastillo started the 2000 season with a seven-game hitting streak from April 5 to 12, though he was placed on the disabled list with a strained back shortly afterwards. A week after coming back, he set a single-game team record with four stolen bases on May 17. He had three in the next game, falling short of the National League record of 8 in two games, set by Walt Wilmot in 1894. In 2000, he also became the Marlins all-time stolen base leader by stealing his 116th career base on June 20 while playing the Milwaukee Brewers. He finished the season with 62 stolen bases, leading the entire major leagues.\n\nIn 2001, Castillo had two hitting streaks, eight games from May 6 to 13 and 14 games from June 29 to July 22. He finished fifth in the league in stolen bases with 33. He also had a .263 batting average, 45 RBIs, and 10 triples, a career high.\n\nIn 2002, Castillo had a 35-game hitting streak, which is the longest ever by a second baseman (since matched by fellow second baseman Chase Utley of the Philadelphia Phillies in 2006). This was the sixth-longest streak in the history of the National League, and also the 10th longest in the history of Major League Baseball. Castillo played second base in the 2002 All-Star Game, the first All-Star selection of his career. In 2002, he hit .305 with 39 RBIs and 48 stolen bases, leading the league in stolen bases for the second time in his career. He was again named the Marlins Most Valuable Player by the South Florida Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.\n\nCastillo was a member of the National League All-Star team in 2003, his second career All-Star selection. He also led the Marlins in hitting and won his first career Gold Glove Award. Castillo was a central figure in the NLCS Game 6 comeback by the Marlins against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field after a foul ball that he hit was knocked away from the Cubs' Moisés Alou by fan Steve Bartman. The Marlins went on to win that game, as well as Game 7, to get to the 2003 World Series, in which the Marlins defeated the heavily favored New York Yankees. This was the second World Series of Castillo's career, but the first in which he actually played.\n\nIn 2004, Castillo had a .291 batting average with 47 RBIs, a career best. He also had two home runs and seven triples. He was second only to Juan Pierre on the Marlins with a .373 on-base percentage and set a Marlins record with his 425th career walk, passing Gary Sheffield's previous mark of 424. Castillo won his second straight Gold Glove and posted the National League's second-best fielding percentage at second base (.991), behind Philadelphia's Plácido Polanco.\n\nIn his final season with the Marlins, Castillo won his third Gold Glove award in a row. He led the majors in batting versus left-handed pitchers with a .423 average. Castillo was also a member of the 2005 National League All-Star team, and replaced Jeff Kent of the Los Angeles Dodgers at second base in the second inning. He was traded to the Minnesota Twins on December 2, 2005, in exchange for two minor leaguers, Scott Tyler and Travis Bowyer. The Marlins replaced Castillo at second base with Dan Uggla, a Rule 5 selection from the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nIn 2006, Castillo began his only full season playing for the Minnesota Twins. He had an impressive first month of hitting, batting .432 with 19 hits. Over that stretch, Castillo drove in runs in five straight games from April 13 to 19. Castillo had three four-hit games for the Twins this season, on April 15, August 5, and August 9. He had a six-game hitting streak from May 6 to 13, and recorded his 300th career stolen base while facing the Chicago White Sox on August 26.\n\nIn the 2007 season, Castillo set a new Major League Baseball record, going 143 games at second base without an error. He also recorded his 1,500th career hit on May 29 while facing the Chicago White Sox. Castillo was traded by the Twins to the New York Mets on July 30, 2007 for two minor league players, catcher Drew Butera and outfielder Dustin Martin. He finished the season with a .301 batting average with one home run, 38 RBIs and 19 stolen bases. On November 18, the Mets re-signed him to a four-year contract worth a reported $25 million.\n\nCastillo had a strong finish to the 2007 season after being traded. He reached base safely in 40 of his last 46 games, and scored 34 runs in his last 42 games. In 50 games as a Met, Castillo batted .296 with 20 RBIs and 10 stolen bases.\n\nIn 2008, a year plagued with injuries and several bench stints, Castillo hit .245 in 87 games, but still managed to steal 17 bases in 19 attempts.\n\nIn 2009 spring training, Castillo led all major league players in walks, with 17 from 56 official at-bats. On March 16, 2009, Castillo was presented the opportunity to bat right-handed instead of being a switch hitter. He declined, and continued to be a switch hitter throughout the rest of his career. Although the Mets struggled as a team, Castillo enjoyed a bounce-back year in '09, hitting .302 with 77 runs scored and a .387 on-base percentage. However, on June 12, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning and runners on first and second base, Castillo dropped an easy pop fly hit by Alex Rodriguez for a two-run game-ending error at Yankee Stadium, earning him a measure of infamy in the Mets–Yankees rivalry and a place in Mets' history.\n\nOn June 4, 2010, the Mets put Castillo on the disabled list because of problems in both his feet. He was replaced by Rubén Tejada who played at second base in the Mets' 5–4 win against the Florida Marlins at Citi Field. He was criticized, along with Carlos Beltrán and Óliver Pérez, for not going to the hospital that had soldiers who had amputated arms and legs; he claimed that he did not want to be horrified by the experience. Castillo commented on not being happy with his playing time and \"has to work something out this offseason\". During spring training of 2010, he was booed by the home fans at Digital Domain Park where the Mets play their spring training games. He was released from the Mets spring training roster on March 18, 2011.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, Castillo signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. On March 22, he reported to Phillies training camp. Castillo was released shortly thereafter on March 30, 2011.\n\nHe appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 2016 election and earned zero votes.\n\nIn 1,720 games over 15 seasons, Castillo posted a .290 batting average (1,889-for-6,510) with 1,001 runs, 194 doubles, 59 triples, 28 home runs, 443 RBI, 370 stolen bases, 800 bases on balls, .368 on-base percentage and .351 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .984 fielding percentage playing every inning of his major league career at second base. In 20 postseason games, he hit .220 (18-for-82) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 4 RBI, 3 stolen bases and 11 walks.\n\nCastillo graduated from the class of 1991 at Colegio San Benito Abad in the Dominican Republic. He is married and has two children—Luis Jr., born on October 12, 2001, and Adonai, born on July 30, 2009.\n\nIn August 2019, Castillo was cited on charges related to a drug trafficking and money laundering operation, while Octavio Dotel was arrested on related charges. In late August 2019, Castillo was cleared of money laundering charges, and it was determined that there was no evidence to link Castillo to any money laundering activity.\n\n"}

{"id": "1888324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888324", "title": "Kingston Memorial Centre", "text": "Kingston Memorial Centre\n\nThe Kingston Memorial Centre is a 3,300-seat multi-purpose arena located at 303 York Street in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1951, the \"Kingston Community Memorial Health and Recreation Centre\" was designed as a community sports and entertainment centre that would become a \"living memorial\" in remembrance of Kingstonians who gave their life in both world wars and the Korean War (Planning Partnership-Hughes Downey Architects 2007, p. 5). The Memorial Centre lands and facilities include a war memorial, a large ice pad in the arena building, a new outdoor aquatic centre, agricultural barns, softball diamonds, a cinder track, off leash dog park and a linear park at the east, north and west perimeter of the property. Just east of the arena building was the International Hockey Hall of Fame (IHHOF) museum building at 277 York St. In July 2012, Kingston City Council approved the relocation of the collection on a short-term basis to the Invista Centre on Gardiners Road in Kingston. The existing building was found to have costly repair issues related to moisture penetration. It was demolished after the IHHOF moved to the Invista Centre in Kingston's west end.\n\nThe Memorial Centre land has been publicly owned since it was acquired in 1841 by the British Government. Its cultural significance reflects local Kingston agricultural, military and recreational history (Planning Partnership-Hughes Downey Architects 2007, p. 4).\n\nAs the Memorial Centre building aged consideration was given by the City of Kingston for ways to rehabilitate the property. In 1993 Parkin Consultants Limited issued a \"Final Report\" on the possible uses of the property based primarily on 1980s data. In 1987, the Kingston Canadians junior hockey club was the main tenant with 60% of the facilities events. Entertainment programing accounted for 12% and trade or consumer shows 24% of events. In 1987 there were $774,862 in ticket sales, facility rentals and other income. But operating costs were $1,093,473. The Parkin report noted that the deficit of $318,311 could be reduced with decreased through measures to reduce maintenance and energy costs and by increasing rent, ticket sales, and canteen revenues.\n\nThe Memorial Centre was the home to the Kingston Frontenacs ice hockey team and its predecessors, the Kingston Canadians and Kingston Raiders from 1973–2008. It was also home to the Kingston Frontenacs of the Eastern Professional Hockey League from 1959-1963. When a new downtown arena, the Leon's Centre opened in 2008, the Frontenacs ceased using the facility, and played their last game at the Memorial Centre on February 15, 2008.\n\nThe Kingston Memorial Centre is the site of the annual Kingston Fall Fair operated by the Kingston and District Agricultural Society. Established in Kingston in 1830 as the Midland Fair and revived in 1912, the Kingston Fall Fair is held over four days each September. It is the second oldest Fair in Ontario, with attendance over 16,000. The society sponsors the Fair with the objective of promoting education through agriculture. The fair includes the largest dairy show held in Ontario.\n\nSince the 1950s the Memorial Centre has been used for many cultural and recreational events including performances by Johnny Cash in 1958 and 1987. Kingston's The Tragically Hip played the centre in 1995 In 2010 it become the home of Kingston Derby Girls, Kingston's first official women's roller derby league.\n\nAfter 2008, the Memorial Centre became the permanent home of the Queen's Golden Gaels (Queen’s varsity hockey), figure skating, and Queen’s intramural ice sports. It replaced the Jock Harty Arena which had been demolished to allow for the construction of new athletic facilities at Queen's University. The Church Athletic League of Kingston hockey teams are based at the centre.\n\nIn 1792 John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of the province of Upper Canada, assisted with the formation of the Agricultural Society of Upper Canada based at Niagara on the Lake to further the development of agriculture in Upper Canada. The society helped to promote agriculture through local agricultural societies and fairs.\n\nOn July 12, 1825, the Upper Canada Herald contained an advertisement for the Frontenac Agricultural Society Fair to be held near Kingston. The fair operated on and off until 1925. That year the group reorganized under the name of the Kingston and District Agricultural Society. It has operated the Kingston Fair successfully since that time.\n\nAs of 1855 the Midland Agricultural Association (which later evolved into the Frontenac Agricultural Society) leased a 23-acre site at the north end of the federal penitentiary reserve bounded on two sides by Palace and Bath Roads. There they built the Crystal Palace (hence the name Palace Road) in 1858 which was moved to the south-east corner of the Memorial Centre site at York and Alfred and re-erected in 1880 after they acquired the land.\n\nFrontenac Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Joseph Longford Haycock (1894 to 1898) served for a number of years as President of the Frontenac Agricultural Association.\n\nThe association sold the land to the City of Kingston in January, 1897 for $17,000. (See transfer dated July 5, 1897, Instrument no. CK13650 and Abstract Index 36072-0235 (R) for Land Registry Office #134). Some of the buildings were transferred from the penitentiary grounds along with the Crystal Palace. A 1915 fire insurance map shows buildings (poultry, dairy, horse barns and exhibition building), a grandstand and half-mile track and palace on the property.\n\nIn November 1944 the Corporation of the City of Kingston passed a by-law for the Establishment, Development and Management of the Kingston Community Memorial Health and Recreation Centre and a by-law authorizing debentures of $100,000 toward the establishment of the centre. But money was not to be provided until the building committee raised $225,000 from the community. The Legislative Assembly of Ontario confirmed the expenditure in Bill 9, \"An Act respecting the City of Kingston\" which received Third Reading on March 22, 1945.\n\nA campaign fund raising pamphlet indicates objective of $400,000 plus $100,000 from the City of Kingston. Donations of more than $38,000 had been received from 65 donors in the closing months of 1945. The pamphlet includes reference to \"the grounds enclosed by the already established half-mile race track… will be used for softball and baseball diamonds, tennis courts etc\".\n\nBy August 1945, at the end of World War II, $80,000 had been raised for the building of the centre. In 1949 Bill Henderson was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands. In 1950 Henderson found federal funds through the Minister of Agriculture for the centre. But the capital funding was tied to the project being dedicated to agricultural purposes and activities as there were no federal funds for an arena. Further capital funding came from the Province of Ontario.\n\nIn a 1950 agreement between the City of Kingston and the Agricultural Society, the Society assigned grants of $300,000 ($150,000 by the Government of Canada and $150,000 by the Province of Ontario) to the city with the following provisions:\n\n- provides for a Memorial Centre Board (this local board was terminated with the 1997 Provincial Amalgamation Order creating the new City of Kingston and was replaced by an Advisory Committee; the City took over all functions of Board)\n- s. 2: rights to use are subject to the Society abiding by regulations and rates set by the City of Kingston\n- s. 2(a) Society has right to use and enjoyment of Fair Grounds, Auditorium and other ancillary buildings and equipment of the Kingston Community Health Recreation Centre for the period when fairs are held. This right does not generally extend beyond the period in September when fairs are held.\n- 2(b) Society has use and enjoyment of other buildings and erections constructed for the purposes of advancing interests of agriculture. [structures are owned by the City of Kingston]\n- 2( c) Society has use and enjoyment of the auditorium when not otherwise allocated or required by the Board of Trustees, for the purposes of the Society. [the \"Auditorium\" is the arena area and the City of Kingston allocates use of it fully throughout year]\n- 2(d) to have expended toward the cost of constructing other buildings for purposes of advancing interests of agriculture, an amount equal to 50% of net profit from operating the Centre [since there has never been a net profit from operations this section of the agreement has never been operative].\n\nIn November 2003 Harvey Rosen was elected mayor of the City of Kingston by a resounding margin. A major plank in his campaign was his commitment to solve the issue of the aging Kingston Memorial Centre, the home to the local OHL hockey team the Kingston Frontenacs, which had a game cancelled during the election campaign due to a leaky roof.\n\nThe Memorial Centre built in 1951 had not been kept up-to-date during its existence and did not now meet promoters and performers needs. Very few performers had performed at the Memorial in the prior 15 years. There had been a number of studies and attempts in the past two decades to address the issues by either renovating the Memorial Centre or building a new facility. Mayor Rosen had committed during his campaign to appoint a citizen task force to explore the problem and present a solution including funding suggestions within 100 days.\n\nIn April 2004 the Mayor’s Task Force submitted its report to the Mayor which contained 22 recommendations; the main recommendation was to build a new large venue entertainment centre (lvec) in downtown Kingston. The mayor presented the report to city council and city council constituted a five-person council committee to verify the validity of the report. The committee and then city council verified the general validity of the report in particular the recommendation to build a 5,500 seat venue in downtown Kingston and constituted a steering committee of public and city council members to make its own implentation recommendations to see a lvec become a reality, including develop a funding solution, as the funding suggestions in the Mayor's Task Force Report were far from complete, it being implicit that a full funding solution would have to be presented to council for approval. Although selling a portion of the Memorial Centre was suggested in recommendation 7 of the mayors Taxk Force Report the steering committee made alternate recommendations regarding funding the new centre which did not include selling any portion of the Memorial Centre grounds to the joy of most of the community. Council endorsed the recommendations of their steering committee. Although controversial at the time, some in community thinking that the Memorial Centre had been saved from the abyss, the truth is that the recommendation of the volunteer member's of the Mayor's Task Force to sell a portion of the Memorial Centre was never brought to a vote at City Council.\n\nAlthough council's steering committee had not tabled its final report regarding the implementation plan for council approval, there was community pressure to address the volunteer task forces finance recommendation to use the Memorial Centre as a financing source. Though the sale of Memorial Centre was never more than a funding idea presented by a citizen’s task force, and although there was never an indication that it was going to be adopted by the steering committee, Council didn't remove it from the business plan for a year and a half and deferred a motion to do so in November, 2004. [source: Council minutes] At the November, 2004 Council meeting delegations were made before Council including that by a local architect who presented her research showing Williamsville District has by far the least park, recreational and cultural space per capita (less than 2/3 of the next lowest District (Kingscourt Strathcona) and pointed out the Official Plan designation of Memorial Centre, singled out as a significant element in the recreational land use system,as Open Area Space and Recreational Space. The Official Plan provides that public open space shall not be sold or alienated in any way unless disposal is warranted by extenuating circumstances and that disposal of any public open space shall be discouraged. This delegation also noted that the Ontario Provincial Policy Statement promoted the equitable distribution of publicly accessible built and natural settings for recreation. Another delegation presented statistics on the importance of recreational facilities and park space to physical health.\n\nPetitions presented to Council between March 30, 2005 and November 20, 2005 totaling 7,380 signatures opposed the sale of the property, the destruction of the building, and the loss of much-needed public park and recreational lands. The signatories recognized the facilities as a living Memorial to those to sacrificed their lives for our Country and, as such, should continue to serve their purpose as a focal point for the many and varied community activities in the neighbourhoods and the City. [Source: Council minutes; see also letters to Friends of the Memorial Centre from City Clerk dated March 30, 2005, April 20, 2005, May 4, 2005, May 20, 2005, and November 10, 2005 when the majority of signatures were presented]\n\nIn November, 2005, Kingston City Council unanimously passed the November, 2004 motion to save the Memorial Centre with some amendments:\n\n- voted unanimously to endorse the use of the site as public community facilities\n- to strike a revitalization committee\n- to hold a public meeting before a report on revitalization was brought back to the City\n\nThe Memorial Centre Revitalization Committee has a mandate to prepare and recommend to City Council a development concept plan and detailed multi-year implementation strategy for revitalization and rejuvenation of the entire 23 acre Memorial Centre site as a public community recreational facility or facilities that will also serve as a fitting living memorial to the men and women of Kingston who lost their lives in the two world wars, the Korean war and subsequent military commitments. The committee would ensure ongoing and inclusive community consultation on the use and operation of the Centre.\n\nIn November 2006, a City Workshop report on a Planning Partnership for the Memorial Centre was released. Over 120 interest groups and agencies were contacted for the report, including the Agricultural Society which indicated the need for improved fencing for crowd control; and improve and increase indoor display space and promote education.\n\nIn July 2007, a Planning Partnership Concept Plan and detailed a multi-year implementation process for the Revitalization and Rejuvenation of the Memorial Centre site report was presented by the City of Kingston. It identifies the Kingston District Agricultural Society (KDAS) as an important stakeholder and the need to respond to physical requirements of the annual fall fair. Members of the design team met with Fair Board to try to understand those needs (see p. 10)\n\nAt a City of Kingston Revitalization Committee meeting held in October 2008, it was noted that it would be difficult to plan for entire site until the completion of discussions with the Agricultural Society on the needs of the Fair.\n\nIn May 2009, Kingston City Council approved the building of a linear park on the east, west and north side of the Centre. Fencing was designed to meet the needs of the Kingston District Agricultural Society during the Fall Fair in September.\nIn February 2010, a linear park was developed in part through discussions by the City with the Agricultural Society to ensure there was no negative impact on the Fall Fair. For example, temporary fencing was not adequate for animal control.\n\nIn July 2010, a City of Kingston Traffic Division staff report does not support proposed pedestrian crossings as it asserts that traffic does not have to yield.\n\nIn May 2011, an e-mail to Friends and Neighbours of the Memorial Centre from City staff noted that the Kingston Community can be very proud of its contribution in reshaping the venue including the creation or sustaining of:\n\nThe City of Kingston, Kingston Memorial Centre Advisory Committee advises City Council and staff on the following issues:\n\nCouncillor Sandy Berg, Councillor Jim Neill, Janine Handforth, Michael Dakin, David Garrick, Steve Garrison, Ken Ohtake\n\nIn 2012, Kingston City Council approved the establishment of a new farmers' market at the Memorial Centre. The Memorial Centre Farmers’ Market started up on May 20, 2012. It promotes local food grown and produced within about 100 km of the market. The market's goal is to expand the market for \"sustainably-produced food in Kingston\".\n\nIn early summer 2012, news of discussions to sell part of the Memorial Centre to the Limestone District School Board for a new high school was released. Early public comment on the suggestion was largely negative and city councillors seem divided on the issue. The results of any further discussions between the City and the school board were undecided as of early 2013. On June 4, 2013 Kingston City Council adopted a motion to not sell any of the land at the Memorial Centre or the Cook's Brothers Arena for a new school building. A year later, in June 2014, Kingston City Council re confirmed its 2013 decision not to sell any portion of the property.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, the newly elected Kingston City Council, featuring seven (of thirteen) first-time Councillors, voted 9-3 NOT to consider the property for a school.\n\nThis was completely a politically motivated move as the VAST majority of Williamsville constituents and parents with school age children wanted the Memorial Centre site for the new school.\n\n\n"}

His live performances consist largely of his own unreleased compositions, and he is noted for scratching his own sounds over his music, creating a live element of turntablism stemming from prowess early in his career as a vinyl DJ.\n\nTipper is widely respected as a surround sound composer, releasing one of the first albums composed, produced, and intended for the DualDisc format, in addition to providing content for multichannel music industry leaders DTS, Inc.. His talents at sound design (his work is included in several of the major music making software programs), and in digital audio mastering, are also in great demand. His catalogue has been consistently licensed for use as background in a variety of mainstream television programmes, and also featured in commercials and cable television projects.\n\nTipper was \"discovered\" as a teenager DJing in a London nightclub by soon-to-be manager Richie Warren. Their earliest conversations centred on bass frequencies and rhythms underlying beats, and they began researching the science involved in creating the most effective dance music. Richie founded Fuel Records (UK), and Tipper released the first of several vinyl EP's in 1997. Renault licensed one of these, \"Twister\", for a European ad campaign. Soon thereafter, Sony UK signed Tipper to their fledgling dance music label, Higher Ground.\n\nIn the late 1990s Tipper completed numerous remix projects of his Higher Ground label mates, and released several singles, each highlighting his penchant for electronic dance music with extreme bass frequencies and intricate polyrhythms; this sound helped usher in a popular new music genre referred to as Nuskool Breakbeat, and Tipper is recognised as one of the pioneering producers of this movement. In 1999 Tipper released his first album, \"The Critical Path\". It was not, however, the breakbeat dance record that the label hoped for. Tipper's vision was decidedly more artistic than anticipated, confusing the label as to how to promote it, and disappointing sales led to an amicable parting of ways with Sony.\n\nDuring the late 1990s while Tipper was busy in the studio, Richie Warren & Co conceptualised the Fuel Sound System. This consisted of 2 identical black 1970s Dodge Challengers, both fitted with 6 x18\" subwoofers (replacing where the back seats had previously been) and a Funktion-One mid/tops speaker unit, that could be raised out of the trunk on hydraulics with the flick of a switch from the driver's dashboard. These cars were able to run independently, without the need for an electrical generator, using 6 batteries charged via an alternator salvaged out of a lorry. With a totally discreet and fully mobile sound system, the Fuel crew, assuming the role of sonic pranksters, began a \"pilgrimage\" of sound that took them on tour to various music festivals, parties & spontaneous gatherings, setting them up outside events and garnering attention for the label and its artists. One of the urban myths surrounding these appearances recounts the incident at the 1997 V Festival, when Richie Warren received complaints from The Prodigy's stage manager, because the band couldn't hear itself due to the excess volume.\n\nWith this activity as a backdrop, Tipper released his second album \"Holding Pattern\" in early 2001. Many of the individual tracks from this album found their way into DJ boxes internationally, and accordingly Tipper began touring extensively through Europe, the United States and Australia. Reflecting his travels was the DJ Mix album \"Sound Off\" which he completed for Fuel later the same year. Tipper focused on the music, and Richie promoted a lifestyle – taking the cars wherever possible to create a happening around both.\n\nTipper and long time friend Mike Wallis formed Crunch in the late 1990s. The pair released two albums and several EP's together over the following years on labels such as Musik Aus Strom and Mike's own imprint Colony Productions. The Full Moon Gathering 2016 was their first USA performance together in over a decade.\n\nWhile touring across the United States in 2003 with the Fuel cars, Tipper began composing tracks for what would become his first album intended entirely as a surround sound listening experience. \"Surrounded\" was released in 2004 by fledgling 5.1 venture MyUtopia Recordings. Eventually nominated as Best Album Intended for Surround Sound this downtempo album also marked a turn in Tipper's musical output away from the NuSkool genre which he was more widely associated with. It was during this period that digital music sales and/or reproduction usurped the music industry, and ultimately Fuel Records (UK) met its demise. As Tipper toured and performed his album in 5.1 wherever possible, Richie re-focused his talents towards advanced automobile parts, and Tipper set off on a non-stop touring schedule for two years, with London only a temporary base between tours. Constantly seen living out of his suitcase, and keeping his \"studio\" in his backpack, earned him the temporary moniker The Global Nomad.\n\nLate 2004 saw his \"Surrounded\" album re-released as a DualDisc title, and this in turn led to the creation of his personal MP3 Surround Sound Player, by mp3 rights holders Fraunhofer Society. Regarded as one of the foremost composers in the multichannel realm, Tipper continues to provide content for a number of companies who use his highly detailed productions to demonstrate their own advanced technologies.\n\n2005 witnessed the establishment of his own imprint Tippermusic, and he embraced the digital music revolution for the freedom it gave musicians to finally determine their own path. No longer constrained by label requirements, Tipper set about releasing his music independently, mostly via online stores. Some investment was made in CDs and vinyl, but ultimately online sales figures showed their declining relevance for his style of output.\n\nTipper began releasing albums at an accelerated rate. First was the ground breaking \"Tip Hop\", which focused on merging hip hop production with electronic trickery and helped usher in a new genre referred to as glitch hop. He immediately followed up with \"Relish The Trough\", which was material consisting of compositions from his catalogue used primarily for his performances on tour. Both albums found favour in Hollywood, and a number of tracks were used as background in prime-time television shows.\n\nHis second full downtempo release \"The Seamless Unspeakable Something\" debuted in 2006, with Tipper in full guise as an electronica trip hop artist. Tracks from this album also found favour as background music for TV shows. In 2007, he digitally remastered his old vinyl catalogue and quietly released \"The Fuel Years\" and \"Higher Ground\". In early 2008, he decided to make available more of his unreleased \"performance catalogue\" and thus \"Tertiary Noise\" was ushered in.\n\nHis 9th studio album, \"Wobble Factor\" would be unveiled later in 2008, and solidified Tipper's influence on the burgeoning glitch hop musical movement, especially in the United States.\n\nShortly after its release, his health demanded his immediate focus, curtailing his studio time and forcing cancellation of all tour dates. While recuperating over time, he laboured on his new ambient/downtempo LP, \"Broken Soul Jamboree\". This album showcased many facets of Tipper's composition and production style, with striking artwork for the album cover and a limited edition poster accompanying the initial CD run.\n\nAfter \"Broken Soul Jamboree\", Tipper released a series of EPs. These included \"Snake Eyes\", the \"Bubble Control\"/\"Puzzle Dust\"/\"Shatter Box\" trilogy, and an EP of three remixes from that trilogy, \"Dusty Bubble Box\", which was released to raise money for his medical expenses. In 2013, Tipper announced he would only participate in two festival appearances for health reasons. On 6 June, he underwent a successful mitral valve repair surgery. Shortly after his recovery, the full-length album \"Forward Escape\" was released in 2014. It took on a darker, more electronically-driven tone than its predecessors, and marked the beginning of a new Tipper sound. He has since released an EP with a similar sound, \"Fathoms\", and a more purely electronic EPs, \"It's Like...\", and \"Lattice\". The most recent full-length album, \"Jettison Mind Hatch\", continues the pattern of downtempo, atmospheric soundscapes that almost the realm of ambient.\n\nHis notoriety has risen considerably in these years as well, and he is often featured as a headlining act at electronic music festivals spanning the entire continental US, with an extensive showing on the West Coast and occasional East Coast shows. Often, especially when he plays over multiple evenings, Tipper splits his sets into \"uptempo\" and \"downtempo.\" His \"uptempo\" sets feature fast tempos and tend toward being a wild dance party. His downtempo sets feature slow to medium tempos and heavy use of melodies. He has also begun to play occasional ambient sets, which generally have limited seating and sell out quickly.\n\nAs of 2015, Tipper continues to play concerts a few times a year, and frequently appears at Burning Man.\n\nIn April 2016, Tipper headlined his first ever appearance at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida, USA, during Tipper & Friends - The Full Moon Gathering. He confirmed after the show that he would return in 2017.\n\nIn August 2017, Tipper curated his own Tipper & Friends music festival at the Astral Valley Art Park, 45 minutes south of St. Louis, Missouri. The event was called '4321' and was held to commemorate the 2017 Solar Eclipse. The venue itself is located in the path of direct totality, and attendees were provided custom Tipper-themed safety glasses to view the event.\n\nIn January 2018, Tipper curated yet another \"Tipper & Friends\" event, this installment being a \"4 Nights in NOLA\" event (also known as the \"4567\" event) located in New Orleans, Louisiana. This event took place from 4 to 7 January and featured two historic New Orleans venues: Tipitina's & the Orpheum Theater. In further homage to New Orleans culture and musical heritage, the event included legendary local acts such as DJ Cochon de Lait and The Madd Wikkid. \n\nFollowing the conclusion of the \"4567\" event, it was announced that Tipper is expected to present an \"ambient journey\" performance on 20 April at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon. The event is also listed to feature legendary kora players Toumani Diabaté and \nSidiki Diabeté.\n\nFollowing the success of 2016's event, April of 2019 lead to the historic \"Tipper & Friends - The Full Moon Return\" back in Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida, USA. \n\nIn January 2020, Tipperfam assembled for another \"Tipper & Friends\" event with a 3 night run back in NOLA (New Orleans, Louisiana). This event took place from 3 to 5 January, returning to the Orpheum Theater. In continuing to pay homage to New Orleans culture and musical heritage, the theatre was left with a great impression of the community involved, even going as far engaging with the crowd in the spirit of Tipper during the 3rd and final night, as this event was extremely private with very few in attendance. The unofficial after-parties deep within the streets of NOLA continued to further the Tipper-vibes until beyond sunrise. This 3-day event has been the 8th and most epic, and most recent installment of the \"Tipper & Friends\" events to date.\n\n"}

After conquering the Japanese settlements on Tsushima and Iki islands, Kublai Khan's fleet moved on to Japan proper and landed at Hakata Bay, a short distance from Kyūshū's administrative capital of Dazaifu. Despite the superior weapons and tactics of the Mongols, who established the Yuan dynasty in China in 1271, the Yuan forces that disembarked at Hakata Bay were grossly outnumbered by the samurai force; the Japanese had been preparing, mobilizing warriors and reinforcing defenses since they heard of the defeats at Tsushima and Iki. The Japanese defenders were aided by major storms which sunk a sizable portion of the Mongolian fleets. Ultimately, the invasion attempt was decisively repulsed shortly after the initial landings.\n\nThe Yuan troops withdrew and took refuge on their ships after only one day of fighting. A typhoon that night, said to be divinely conjured wind, threatened their ships, persuading them to return to Korea. Many of the returning ships sank that night due to the storm.\n\nAfter landing in the bay, the Yuan force quickly overran the town of Hakata (now a ward of Fukuoka), but were engaged by a number of samurai soon afterwards.\n\nAt first, the samurai were hopelessly outmatched; accustomed to smaller scale clan rivalries, they could not match the organization and massed firepower of the invaders. The Mongols fought with precision, loosing heavy volleys of arrows into the ranks of the Japanese. The Mongols also employed an early form of rocket artillery, and their infantry used phalanx-like tactics, holding off the samurai with their shields and spears. Though unable to conclusively defeat the Yuan forces, the Japanese fought hard and inflicted heavy casualties.\n\nIn the course of the day's fighting, the Hakozaki Shrine was burned to the ground.\n\nDespite their initial victories, the Yuan did not pursue the samurai further inland to the defenses at Dazaifu. \"Nihon Ōdai Ichiran\" explains that the invaders were defeated because they lacked arrows.\n\nMore likely this was a result of their unfamiliarity with the terrain, the expectation of Japanese reinforcements, and the heavy losses already suffered. The Yuan force, which may have intended to carry out a reconnaissance in force rather than an immediate invasion, returned to their ships. That night, the Yuan lost roughly one-third of their force in a typhoon. They retreated back to Korea, presumably at the prodding of their sailors and captains, rather than regrouping and continuing their attack.\n\nOn November 4, about 1,000 soldiers of the Mongol Army landed on Komoda Beach. Sukekuni So(宗助国), Shugodai of Tsushima Island was killed in action.\nMongolians slaughtered dwellers of Tsushima.\n\nOn November 13, Taira no Kagetaka(平景隆), Shugodai of Iki led about 100 soldiers. They were defeated by the Mongolian army, and Shugodai committed suicide in Hidzume Castle(樋詰城). About 1,000 Japanese soldiers were killed there.\n\nOn November 15 to 16, Mongolian army attacked the base of Sashi Clan. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers and Husashi Sashi(佐志房), Tomaru Sashi(佐志留) and Isamu Sashi(佐志勇)\nwere killed.\n\nMongolian Army landed on Sawara District and encamped in Akasaka. On seeing this situation, Kikuchi Takefusa (菊池 武房) surprised the Mongolian army.\nThe Mongols escaped to Sohara, and they lost about 100 soldiers.\n\nThousands of Mongolian soldiers were awaiting in Torikai-Gata. Suenaga Takesaki(竹崎季長), one of the Japanese commanders, assaulted the Mongolian army and fought them.\nSoon, reinforcements by Michiyasu Shiraisi(白石通泰) arrived there and defeated the Mongolians. The Mongolian casualties of this battle are estimated at around 3,500.\n\nDue to the defeat in the battle of Torikai-Gata, the Mongolian army was exhausted. So they withdrew to their own ships. On seeing this situation, the Japanese army did night attacks and killed many soldiers.\nFinally, Hong Dagu decided to withdraw to Yuan Dynasty. In the midst of the withdrawal, they met a typhoon, most of their ships sank and many soldiers drowned.\n\n\n"}

When Rover Scouts were part of Scouting in the UK, the Group included a Rover Crew, the 13th Oxford. The stated aim of the group is to enable members of the University of Oxford to “maintain, acquire, or renew an interest in the Scout and Guide Movements”.\n\nThe group was founded in 1919 under the name of \"O.U.B.P. Scout Club\", with the first formal meeting held on 24 November that year. Women were first admitted to OUSGG the following year. For a number of years, the group ran in parallel with Oxford University Rover Crew and Oxford University Girl Guide Club, until 1939, when these merged into the Scout group. In 1940 the O.U. Guide Club was reformed, though it turned out it had never officially disbanded.\n\nMissing records make the exact tracking of various mergers and separations between the Rover, Scout, and Guide groups difficult, but the name Oxford University Scout and Guide Group was officially accepted when the group constitution was rewritten in 1962.\n\nFor 50 years the Group camped in the Easter vacation, and the late summer vacation, at the Ennerdale Scout Camp of the Cumbria Scout Country.\n\nThe Group was responsible for organising the first two international Scout and Guide camps at Gilwell Park in 1959 and 1961. These events are called Witans, named after the Anglo-Saxon gathering of the wise called a Witan.\n\nIts membership mainly comprises members of the University of Oxford; however within certain limits other people may join. It is affiliated to the Student Scout and Guide Organisation (SSAGO). During the University's term the group meets on Monday nights, with a lunchtime meeting (‘NnN’) held on Thursdays. During University vacations the group goes on trips, the most notable being “Winter Walking” held over the New Year.\n\nThe mascot of the group is Erik the Panda. Erik is a stuffed toy, given to the group in 1974, by a member formerly of St Hugh's College. At this time his name was spelled Eric; this has changed over the years, and has even at times been spelled with a backwards k. His \"birthday\" is celebrated at the meeting preceding Shrove Tuesday. Erik's official costume is sub-fusc, including a commoners' gown embroidered with the group name, and a mortarboard - though the latter has been lost.\n\n\"PostScript\" is the thrice-termly publication of the Group. It is not only a newsletter informing members, ex-members and old members of upcoming events and activities, but also serves as a permanent record of the group's history. A copy of each new issue is stored in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford.\n\n\n"}

Today, approximately 1,150 students attend ESD, aged Beginner (age 3) through 12th grade, with 435 students in the Upper School (9th – 12th grade). David L. Baad is the Head of School.\n\nThe campus, which is continuing to expand, contains three major buildings, with a total of 248,000 sq ft (23,000 m²) in facilities. The campus encompasses over . The school's first building, the gymnasium, was built in the late 1970s. Until the main building was in 1981, classes were held in the gym. In 1986, the school had another major expansion, which added a library, publication suite, and fine arts facilities, along with additional classrooms and offices.\n\nThe Cook Math and Science Building was completed in 1994 to allow the construction of additional science labs, computer labs, and math classrooms. Daily chapel was moved from the gym to the All Saints Chapel following its completion in 2002. In 2005, another project, the Susan M. Frank Center for Arts and Humanities Building opened, allowing for the construction of additional humanities classrooms, as well as expanded music facilities. In addition, the school also offers a Proscenium and a black box theater, ceramics studio, and a digital imaging suite and darkroom. Additional improvements include a 55,000 sq ft (5,100 m²) humanities building added to the Merrell Road campus, a new stadium and new turf field, and improved locker room facilities. The new stadium also features improved accommodations for fans. The school also acquired an outdoor education center in northern Collin County, spanning spans 165 acres (0.67 km²).\n\nIn 2010, the school opened its Stephen B. Swann Athletic and Wellness Center. The building houses Dining Commons, physical education facilities, and additional office space. The building, covering over 100,00 sq.ft., also includes a gymnasium, indoor track, conditioning and workout facilities, a dance studio, and sports medicine facilities. The building was later modified to expand locker rooms and add a team room and athletic offices. The new dining facilities can seat 480 students, and overlook the school's quarry and Louise Crespi Benners Courtyard. The kitchen also houses a laboratory for instruction from nutritional experts and professional chefs, based on guidelines from the Center for Human Nutrition at The University of Texas Southwest Medical Center.\n\nESD has an enrollment of more than 1,100 students and more than 200 faculty and staff members. They have a student-faculty ratio of 7:1. The student population contains a plurality of Episcopalian (30%) and Caucasian students (82%). The school also provides tuition assistance to students through grants.\n\nIn 2012, the school was found guilty of fraud and negligent behavior for mishandling a 2009 statutory rape. The 34-year-old teacher pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 16-year-old student in the criminal case. Administrators forced the victim to withdraw upon hearing about their relations. The student's parents pressed civil charges against ESD and were awarded $9 million for punitive and compensatory damages from the withdrawal.\n\n\n"}

Lang serves as the main antagonist of the film and was portrayed by Mr. T.\n\nLang is a professional boxer fighting out of Chicago, Illinois and a one-time world heavyweight champion, having taken the title from Rocky Balboa only to lose it back to Balboa in his next fight. The character is very loosely based on a combination of Sonny Liston, Larry Holmes and George Foreman.\n\nJames Lang lost both of his parents at an early age, and spent most of his childhood in orphanages and on the streets of Chicago's Southside; he eventually became involved with crime, and served time in juvenile facilities. Later, as an adult, Clubber was sent to prison for five years for felony aggravated assault. During his time in prison, he discovered boxing as a way to let out his frustration and anger, which leads to the events of \"Rocky III\". This is also evident in the game \"Rocky Legends\", where Clubber's storyline begins with him fighting in the Chicago Prison in a ring actually inside the prison itself. One novelization of the film called Lang's manager \"Donut.\"\n\nDuring \"Rocky III\"'s intro, Rocky is shown easily defeating numerous contenders in a montage, during which Lang is shown annoyed at Rocky apparently coasting through his title defenses. Lang decides to begin training himself to challenge Rocky and his methods bring results as he puts together a string of knockouts that soon make him the number one contender. He appears at a public event to goad a now complacent Rocky who is announcing his retirement. Lang finally infuriates Rocky by propositioning his wife Adrian in front of Rocky's numerous fans and the television media, and Rocky agrees to fight him.\n\nRocky expects another easy victory and continues his complacent attitude towards training, which angers and worries his manager and trainer Mickey Goldmill. On the night of the fight, Lang taunts the champion in the hallway as they are walking to the ring and provokes a scuffle between the two camps, shoving Mickey so hard that the latter suffers a heart attack which further distracts Rocky from the fight (and later proves fatal). He also angers former champion Apollo Creed by refusing to shake his hand before the fight and mocking him as a \"has been\". Creed tells Balboa, \"Do us all a favor and drop this chump.\" Lang overwhelms Rocky and knocks him out in two rounds.\n\nLang's first defense of his newly-won title is a rematch against Rocky. Balboa has learned a newer boxing style based on speed and finesse from Creed. The champion has trouble with Rocky's new technique and soon tires after becoming enraged and throwing a large number of wild hooks, attempting to knock Rocky out quickly. Although several punches are damaging, Balboa taunts Lang by saying \"knock me out, champ\" and claiming the resulting punches were \"nothing\", further enraging Lang who continues to swing wildly. Rocky exploits his opponent's exhaustion and knocks him out in the third round.\n\nLang's career results following the second fight with Balboa are unknown; outside of a replay of the final round in the beginning of \"Rocky IV\", he was not seen in any of the four films that followed. In one version of the script of \"Rocky Balboa\", Lang became a born-again Christian and was now addressed by his given name of James. Lang was also slated to be one of the commentators of the Balboa vs. Mason \"The Line\" Dixon fight..\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 16, 2000. In the episode, Bart believes he has the power to heal others through faith after removing a bucket glued to Homer's head. Meanwhile, Homer creates a homecoming game float for Springfield University. \n\nThe episode, which features guest appearances from Don Cheadle and Joe Mantegna, received generally positive reviews from critics following its release on home video in the season 11 DVD.\n\nHomer receives a letter from Springfield University inviting him to an upcoming reunion party, where Dean Bobby Peterson reveals it is actually a fundraiser for the college's football team and forcibly takes all of the attendees' money. As revenge, Homer decides to pull a prank on Dean Peterson with his old nerd friends, Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. He tries to put a bucket filled with glue on the Dean's head, but another fraternity had already hung another bucket full of glue over the door; it falls on Homer's head, and he cannot get it off. He tries to drive with holes cut in the bucket over his eyes, but he drives the family off course — to a religious revival, hosted by a faith healer named Brother Faith, where Bart pulls the bucket off Homer's head. Brother Faith considers this act a sign that Bart has \"the power\" of healing. Lisa is skeptical and attempts to use reason to explain that the hot stage lights heated the metal bucket, causing the glue to liquefy and thus loosen, while at the same time expanding the bucket and allowing Bart to pull it off. Undaunted, Bart becomes a faith healer, pulls miracles of his own, and even forms his own church which massively outdraws Reverend Lovejoy's congregation on its first day of operation. There, Bart heals Springfield's residents (when in fact, his demonstrations for the day consist of punching Grandpa in his paining artificial hip, Professor Frink where he had been suffering a cramp in his back, and slapping Patty's cigarette out of her mouth).\n\nThe church is cut short, however, when Milhouse is run down, though not fatally, after he mistakes an oncoming truck for a dog; Bart had \"healed\" him of his myopia during his revival meeting by knocking his glasses off his face. Subsequently, Bart decides to end his career as a faith healer. Meanwhile, Homer prepares for Springfield University's homecoming football game by building a float that he has fashioned out of flowers he has stolen from Ned Flanders. At the game, everyone cheers for S.U.'s football team's star player, a kicker named Anton Lubchenko. Homer gets drunk and forgets he has made a float to celebrate SU. He crowd surfs down to the playing field, and runs to his float. Unfortunately, the other floats have left the field and the players have come back on. Homer drives his float over the leg of Lubchenko, horribly wounding him. Fat Tony, who had bet a substantial amount of money on Lubchenko's performance, threatens to kill Homer with an ice pick if Lubchenko does not return to the game. Homer convinces Bart to try to heal the kicker. Bart prays to God to help him heal the kicker. With his team down by two points, Lubchenko returns to the game and kicks the winning field goal, losing his leg in the process. Bart announces at the end of the game that he now knows that he does not have special powers and so is not a healer. Dr. Hibbert tells Bart he is happy with this: \"Fine, more money for me.\"\n\n\"Faith Off\" was written by Frank Mula and directed by Nancy Kruse as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). The episode features guest appearances from Don Cheadle as Brother Faith and Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony. A major theme in \"Faith Off\" is the Christian practice of faith healing. In his 2008 book \"The Springfield Reformation: The Simpsons, Christianity, and American Culture\", Jamey Heit wrote that \"\"The Simpsons\" reiterates the vibrancy that defines black Christianity in 'Faith Off.' A faith healer, Brother Faith, inspires Bart to nurture his spirituality. Bart responds to the call and at least for the rest of the episode embraces the spiritual vibrancy that he learns from a black Christian leader.\"\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 16, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Matt Selman, and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. A song Bart sings in the episode, called \"Testify\", was released on the soundtrack album \"\" in 2007.\n\nReception from critics has been generally positive. While reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on \"Faith Off\", noting: \"If nothing else, I like this one for the sight of Homer with the bucket stuck on his head; something about seeing him with those little eyeholes entertains me. Otherwise there’s not much powerful at work here. The healing plot is a decent one, and Don Cheadle gives us a good guest performance. The program is fine but not much more than that.\" \n\nNancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode as one of the episodes she felt \"shined in season eleven\". Alison Kerr of \"The Herald\" called the episode \"brilliant\". \n\nIn his review of the eleventh season, Den of Geek critic Mark Oakley wrote that \"there are some fine episodes to be found\", such as \"Faith Off\", which he described as a \"highlight\". He added that the \"song Testify harks back to the brilliance of the show’s great musical numbers like The Stonecutters Song.\" In 2003, the \"Orlando Sentinel\"s Gregory Hardy named \"Faith Off\" the fifth best episode of the show with a sports theme. \n\nJerry Greene, another \"Orlando Sentinel\" columnist, listed the episode at number seven on his 2004 list of the show's \"Top 10 Sporting Episodes\". He particularly liked the inscription on Springfield University's gateway that says: \"If you can read this, you're accepted.\"\n\n"}

It has recently been published as The Game.\n\nThe book is a hard science fiction dystopian novel set in 2154, a time when machines and robots perform most jobs and children go to government schools. Because of this, very few people are employed, with many people living on a social welfare system for support. The unemployed people have nothing to look forward to, except various illicit drugs. Some have formed gangs, some are shown to be agitating for political reform (in chapter 5 there is a reference to leaflets printed up), and many are involved in organized crime of some form or another. The government, possibly the only government in existence at this point, is shown to have complete control over its citizens by restricting the unemployed to designated areas (DAs), and having similar control over the working-class.\n\nThe working-class people are taught to hate the unemployed citizens, and the unemployed generally want money and employment, in a classic class struggle.\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of \"Lisse\", a recent graduate of school.\n\n\"Lisse\" and her nine friends are unemployed after graduating from a respected private school, and are assigned to live as a group in an abandoned warehouse in a Designated Area (DA). They discover that by day, the area they live in is a dreary, dirty, unsafe place. By night, however, the unemployed party. Lisse and her friends spend care-free evenings after they realize that they are a team and that this is their life now. The thought police quickly step in to quell any large problems or disputes. For their own safety, they study karate and other self-preservation skills. In the night, Lisse and her friends hear of a mysterious 'game', called \"The Game\" with capital letters. It is known that participants can only be selected, and that anyone who requests to join will always be declined... In the unsafe night, they encounter a suspicious man named Charlie, who offers Lisse's friend and housemate Alden a partnership. Charlie wants to use Alden's skills in chemistry, this and encounters with other young homeless people suggests the use of drugs in their DA. Alden declines and beaten up by a gang of Charlie's thugs. Lisse and her friends learn that they need to protect themselves, and another housemate, Brad, scrounges for materials to turn their warehouse into a protected \"castle\".\n\nOne day the group got invited to \"The Game\", which turns out to be a virtual-reality full-world simulation. They are given electronic passes and have to travel by train to where The Game is taking place. During the journey, they are treated disdainfully by the employed workers they encounter. Once at The Game's location, they lay on couches and enter the simulated world of The Game. This simulation is based in an outdoor environment and the aim seems to be survival in this different climate. Having little else to look forward to in their lives, the group focuses on training and information gathering during their time between Game sessions. They develop a schedule of regular exercise (consisting of jogging and weight-training), search for information in the local library, and discuss their experiences and motivations. As they progress in The Game, they find that they have needs (for a doctor and someone with agricultural knowledge). People they knew from school re-enter their lives, filling those needs, although they initially believe this to be a coincidence. During their sessions in The Game they are always brought back to reality if they experience danger, such as eating poisoned berries. In the real world, they record everything that happens in The Game, mapping the areas they find and keeping track of the flora and fauna they encounter. They also speculate what they would win if they won The Game, thinking about prizes of credits to buy anything they like, including travel.\n\nAfter a year of such training, The Game session changes, they have a different initial experience and although they are placed in the same world, it feels different. They discover they are not awakened if they are in danger of hurting themselves. They first think this means they have gone to a new, higher level of The Game but start to realize they are never going to 'wake up' and that they are in their new home forever. At first they believe they have been sent to another country, but they recognize this cannot be true when they realize they have never seen the moon, which is visible from everywhere on Earth. They stay up at night to look at the stars and the position of these makes them realize they are in a totally different part of the galaxy. This new planet they discovered was named \"Prize\". Prize was very different from Earth, colorful, Fresh, underwhelming, Quiet, healthy, and more. Prize was a new opportunity to create a world with problems like, health problems, political problems, pollution etc.\n\nThey realize that The Game was a kind of training program meant to prepare the group- and others like them- for an off-world colony project. This project is designed to halt the massive overpopulation the world is suffering. The different start of this phase of The Game, which they thought was a new level, was in fact their transportation to the new world, where they have been left forever. Lisse remembers them landing in an egg-like structure which they rediscover and this confirms they have been transported. Eventually, they christen the new world 'Prize'- ironically at first- as their new life there is what they have won in The Game.\n\nIt is hinted that part of the reason such a group of people were unemployable out of school was to help in the colonization of other worlds, since each seed group would need a variety of talents. Indeed, an early portion of the book reinforces this supposition, as it explains that the prestigious school from which Lisse and her friends graduated once had a 90% job-placement rate, which is now a mere 10%— possibly suggesting that the most qualified workers are being placed within the Game system rather than the workforce.\n\nLisse and her group meet and integrate with another group and they all eventually pair off into relationships. Lisse explains that her original group could not intermarry as they are too close and feel like family. The book ends with Lisse making paper to write a story to the unborn baby she is revealed to be carrying, which she thinks will be a girl. The first child born on Prize.\n\nThe first sentence she writes is the first of the book and by this literary device it is revealed that the book they have read is what Lisse herself has written of her story.\n"}

His date of birth is unknown, and nothing is known of his early youth. In 1216 he became incumbent of the parish of Wevelinghoven near Düsseldorf; in 1226 he was canon and, some years later, provost of the cathedral of Cologne. After the death of Heinrich von Müllenark (26 March 1238) the cathedral chapter elected Konrad Archbishop of Cologne. He received the archiepiscopal insignia from the Emperor Frederick II at Brescia in August of the same year. The following year, on 28 October, he was ordained priest and consecrated archbishop by Ludolf von Holte, Bishop of Münster.\n\nFor the first few months of his reign, the new archbishop sided with the emperor in his conflict with Pope Gregory IX, but for unknown reasons went over to the papal party shortly after the emperor's excommunication (12 March 1239). The whole temporal administration of Konrad was a series of struggles with neighbouring princes and the citizens of Cologne, who refused to acknowledge the temporal sovereignty of the archbishop over their city. Konrad was generally victorious, but his often treacherous manner of warfare has left many dark spots on his reputation. When Pope Innocent IV deposed Frederick II (17 July 1245), it was chiefly due to the influence of Konrad that the pope's candidate, Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia, was elected king; when Henry died after a short reign of seven months (17 February 1247), it was again the influence of Konrad that placed the crown on the head of the youthful William of Holland.\n\nShortly after this decision the hitherto friendly relations between Pope Innocent IV and the archbishop ceased, and in April 1250, the Apostolic legation in Germany was committed to Pierre de Colmieu, Bishop of Albano. At the same time began Konrad's estrangement from King William, which finally led to open rebellion. With all the means of a powerful and unscrupulous prince, Konrad attempted to dethrone William and probably would have succeeded had not the king's premature death made the archbishop's intrigues unnecessary. After the death of King William (28 January 1256), Konrad played an important role in the election of the new king. He sold his vote for a large sum to Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III of England, and crowned him at Aachen on 17 May 1257. This was the last important act of Konrad. He died on 28 September 1261 and is buried in the cathedral of Cologne, of which he laid the cornerstone on 15 August 1248.\n"}

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., WIOT is the Toledo affiliate for \"The Bob & Tom Show\" and \"The House of Hair with Dee Snider\". The WIOT studios are located in Downtown Toledo, while the station transmitter resides in the Toledo suburb of Oregon. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WIOT broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio.\n\nWIOT began as WTOL-FM in October 1949.\n\nWIOT was Toledo's first FM rock station when it went on the air December 25, 1972, replacing a beautiful music/classical format. WIOT's call letters came about from doodle using the frequency numbers 1-0-4-7 . In Spring of 1972, newly appointed operations manager Chuck Schmidt was trying to derive the calls from the frequency number. 1=I 0=O and 7=T. W-I-O-T. \"W\" because the station is East of the Mississippi. The origins of the calls and what they mean are hotly contested. Longtime WIOT engineer Dennis P Moon confirms this. Moon was present when Schmidt created the calls in 1972. He is still the chief engineer as of 2019. The call letters were in the past WTOL-FM and WCWA-FM.\n\nBuck and O'Connor hosted mornings in the early 1980s. Buck McWilliams and Chris O'Connor. They left WIOT to Milwaukee and then Minneapolis. Other on air personalities at that time...Terry Sullivan one half of the Sullivan and O'Connor show. Lee Randall. Joan Major. Done Jardine. Never could forget Pat Still. Jane Perry. Pat and Jane.\n\nIn the late 1980s The Bob and Brian morning show became the next Toledo favorite. The show left for Milwaukee where they remain to this day, currently at WHQG.\n\nThe next morning team that created an impact was The Dawnbusters (known as Jeff Lamb and Mark Benson). Jeff provided all of the voices and skits, while Mark kept the shows pace. The show was a major success. \n\nOther DJs during this time were: Program Director Lyn Casey, Michael Young (\"Party Party Party\"), Don Davis, Dave Duran, Beckey Shock, Dennis O'Brian, Beth Daniels, & Will Worster.\n\nIn 1994 The station hired the \"new\" Dawnbusters Carlson and Mckenzie. They brought a new life in morning radio for Toledo. Carlson and Mckenzie drew large morning numbers.\n\nAfter about 2 years Carlson and Mckenzie left for Boston (now on 100.7 WZLX) and new owners Enterprise Media hired back Jeff and Mark.\n\nIn 1998 the station was bought by Jacor Media where they tweaked the format (a bit more hard rock) and they inked a deal with syndicated morning show The Bob and Tom Show where it airs to this day.\n\nAround this time new jocks were introduced to the listeners. Susan Gates (mid-days), Troy Michaels (7p-12m) and overnights with Grizzly Brown. Darrin Arrens became the PD. Darrin and Susan left in 1999.\n\nDon Davis left in 2001 and was replaced by Dave Rossi as PD (from the WAVE-FM in South Carolina). \n\nWIOT began to return to its major stranglehold on the Toledo rock ratings.\n\nRossi left in 2003 to head back to South Carolina. Troy Michaels took over afternoons and Grizzly moved up to evenings.\n\nWIOT's broadcast studio is at the iHeartRadio building at South Superior. The station's transmitter is located at North Wynn and Cedar Point Roads in Oregon, Ohio. In September of 2019 WIOT's transmitter site was named the Dennis P Moon Transmitter Site, in honor of engineer Denny Moon's 50 years at the station. Prior to its home on South Superior, the station was located on the third floor of Fort Industry Square. WIOT's beginnings were at 604 Jackson Street, the site of the former News-Bee building and what is now One Government Center. Their longtime owner was Reams Broadcasting, begun by Fraser Reams Sr. and later by his son, Fraser Junior. Reams also owned WCWA and WTOL-TV and WCWA-FM's transmitter was on WTOL-TV's tower.\n\nWIOT is licensed for HD Radio operations. Its HD2 programming consists of a simulcast of WCWA-AM's Fox Sports Radio format.\n\nThe station serves Toledo and northwest Ohio, but its signal also reaches downtown Detroit, the southern and western suburbs (the latter due to the hills) as well as most of Essex County, Ontario, including Windsor, Ontario and Leamington, Ontario. Under exceptionally good conditions (such as fog), the station's signal can reach Chatham, Ontario. The signal reaches as far south as Marion, Ohio and Bucyrus, Ohio and into Michigan as far north as Flint, Michigan, Lapeer, and Port Huron, Michigan before it starts to interfere with Woodstock, Ontario's CIHR-FM, which is also on 104.7 FM.\n\nThe station also experiences regular interference from Geneva, Ohio's WKKY, which is also on 104.7, near the Wheatley, Ontario and Comber, Ontario areas (mostly in the southeastern corner of Essex County).\n\nDuring 2011, WIOT was also experiencing interference from Detroit repeater W284BQ, which was simulcasting WGPR's \"The Oasis\" smooth jazz subchannel on 104.7 MHz. In May 2011, WIOT filed a complaint with the FCC, saying that W284BQ interferes with WIOT in the Michigan portion of their broadcast area. WIOT had also solicited comments and reception reports from listeners in the affected area. Martz Communications Group, which owns the repeater and programs \"The Oasis\", would soon after establish a website, http://www.savetheoasis.com/, which explains the station's position on the issue, stressing that WIOT should not get special treatment on the grounds that it is an Ohio radio station that serves no part of Detroit, though the statement is not exactly true. WIOT's protected contour does serve parts of the Detroit area, in part due to its grandfathered status.\n\nOn October 18, 2011, the FCC sided with Clear Channel on the issue, and ordered W284BQ to cease operation immediately. Martz would later apply with the FCC to relocate W284BQ to 93.9, potentially interfering with Windsor, Ontario station CIDR-FM, then later to 93.5, before giving up on the concept altogether.\n\n"}

It was the first such service offered by a major news agency and existed from 1958 to 1999.\n\nA late 1950s offshoot of UPI's television footage service, \"UPI Movietone,\" later known as United Press International Television News or UPITN, \"UPI Audio,\" began selling the sounds of newsmakers stripped from newsfilm, plus the voices of UPI reporters and stringers to client radio stations.\n\nIt was originally done on a piecemeal basis, with UPI's wire for broadcasters, known as the National Radio Wire, carrying lists of available material. \nOver time, that list came to be called a billboard, and it moved several times a day. As the operation grew, it was expanded from dial-up telephone to feeds by leased line, the audio material, now branded as Audio Roundup was fed at specific times, usually at ten minutes past the hour.\n\nIn early 1966, UPI acquired the assets and key personnel of a similarly named (but previously unrelated) competing service, Radio Press International. Out of that merger came an audio service that at its peak served more than a thousand U.S. radio stations and many foreign clients, including other networks such as NPR, RKO, Britain's Independent Radio News and even CNN in its early years when CNN, then headed by former UPI and UPTN executives Reese Schonfeld and Burt Reinhardt, effectively reunited UPI audio with UPITN video.\n\nIn the early 1970s, UPI Audio began offering a newscast at the top of the hour.\n\nSoon thereafter, it added live sportscasts and business reports. Among UPI Audio's sportscasters of the late 1970s were Keith Olbermann and Sam Rosen.\n\nUnlike most commercial radio networks, which usually paid local stations to air their programming (and commercials), UPI charged stations cash for its broadcast services, allowing them to sell their own advertising within or adjacent to UPI broadcasts. It is the model that then-rival wire service Associated Press also used when it followed UPI into the radio network field in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe service name was changed from UPI Audio to UPI Radio Network in 1983 to reflect the greater focus on live programming.\n\nAfter a long period of changing ownerships, business models and bankruptcies, UPI declined into a shell of a news service by 1999, when its then-Saudi Arabian ownership was convinced by its handpicked CEO, Arnaud de Borchgrave, to exit the broadcasting business United Press had pioneered back in the 1930s. The rump UPI sold its client list of its radio network and broadcast wire to its former rival, the AP.\n\n"}
{"id": "1888417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888417", "title": "Transtar Radio Networks", "text": "Transtar Radio Networks\n\nTranstar was the first radio network to provide 24-hour music programming to local affiliates. The slate of 24-hour networks is now owned by Westwood One and operated by Dial Global. The studios are located in Valencia, California.\n\nTranstar was founded in 1981 by C. Terry Robinson. The network debuted at around the same time as the Satellite Music Network, based in Mokena, Illinois. Both companies marketed themselves to prospective affiliates by offering carefully selected music presented by major market talent of high quality that a local station could never afford, as well as the capability of using existing studio equipment like reel-to-reel tape decks and cartridge playback machines to help make an affordable transition. A station signing up for the service would likely need a satellite antenna and receiver, a 25 Hz tone generator to place at the end of commercial clusters at the end of a break recorded on the reel, and 25/35 Hz tone sensors to trigger local liners and station identification. The network communicated with affiliates by using a computer printer (most likely in the studio) that would keep local programming staff informed of announcer changes, closed circuit feeds, and other vital information.\n\nWhile Satellite Music Network had more affiliates, Transtar offered one major advantage over SMN...a digital cue system. This was especially important among potential affiliates that were FM stations. The digital cue system allowed the network to cue tape machines at the local affiliate station with external data channels sent on a separate digital subcarrier. SMN, on the other hand, cued stations using a subaudible tone on the program feed as it was aired live, but eliminated them from being heard by listeners through filtering out the lower end of the audio signal. While the difference in audio would be negligible at worst on an AM affiliate, it was particularly obvious on an FM station subscribing to the service when a bass line heard on a particular favorite song was now found to be missing.\n\nAn engineer at the receiving station could tweak the lower end of the signal by making adjustments on the station's audio processing, allowing the missing bass line to be heard, but then the subaudible cues would, as a result, be fully audible over the air. Transtar used this as a sales tool when marketing their service to prospective affiliates, while often charging inventory on top of a monthly subscription fee, feeling that prospective affiliates would be willing to pay more for a higher quality service. On the downside, announcer shifts, because they originated on the West Coast, all began and ended in the Pacific Time Zone, which made it difficult for East Coast-based affiliates to successfully market individual announcer dayparts, particularly during the morning. This would change years later, when announcer start times were adjusted to favor Eastern and Central Time zones.\n\nIn 1989, the company merged with the United Stations Radio Network (which had already bought the RKO Radio Networks in 1985). The new company was named Unistar. That entity, in turn, was bought by Westwood One in 1993. The music networks were run as a self-branded division of Westwood One until 2006, when the agreement with Dial Global began.\n"}

For example, a button would be pressed triggering a local station's call letters and frequency (referred to as \"magicalls\") at the receiving station that was pre-recorded by the talent. The talent would then wait anywhere from 3 to 5 seconds before beginning to speak. Another button pressed at the end of a talk break by the talent would trigger a cluster of local commercials at the receiving station, or a closure tone at the receiving station would send control back to the network if there were no commercials. The network provided music and DJs, localized talent-matching liners, limited promotions support consisting of ideas used by other affiliates, and years later, a website. As the network moved from analog to digital satellite, it also provided receivers to affiliates to use on a loaned basis.\n\nA \"clock\" was provided to affiliates outlining the placement of news and commercial cut-aways, and differed throughout the day and weekends. The clock included options for a 2-, 3-, or 5-minute newscasts at the top of the hour, followed by other holes for local spots. While the programming was live, DJs had to avoid references to the weather or anything else that would not be appropriate in many time zones. An 800-line was eventually added, allowing the live DJs to take phoned in requests. \n\nSMN began in 1981 in Mokena, Illinois in a strip mall with two formats: AC (adult contemporary) - signed on by Bob Leonard (not the basketball player of the same name), and Country - signed on by Gary Semro. In less than three years, the network had signed more than 300 affiliates. By the late 1980s, SMN was broadcasting to more than 600 stations nationwide and in the Caribbean. In late 1989, SMN merged into ABC Radio (now Cumulus Media) and moved operations to Dallas, and expanded the number of available formats to ten. Today, this division is named Westwood One.\n\nBonneville Broadcasting also signed on with an easy listening format simultaneously to SMN - signed on by Tim Kolody from the same studios in August 1981. Bonneville pulled out of SMN in June 1984.\n\nAmong the talent that was employed at SMN was Chicago radio legend Eddie Hubbard and Joe Lacina on the Stardust format, Dean Richards who can be heard on WGN and WGN-TV in Chicago; Karen Williams of WNUA; Dennis Jon Bailey, now morning show host and Marconi Award winner at WIKY Radio in Evansville; News was done by Larry Langford also of WIND at the time and later WMAQ in Chicago; and John Calhoun, who continues to broadcast in the Chicago market. A top 40 network called \"The Heat\" also existed, but little historical information is available for this network. The networks were later moved to Dallas, Texas, where talent on Country Coast to Coast included: Jim Beedle, Jim Casey, Ted Clark, Steve Sharp, Jerry Walker, R.J. Steele, Mark Edwards, Jim Brady, Becky Wight, Catfish Prewitt. On StarStation the talent included: Peter Stewart, Bob Leonard, John Lacy, Janice Williams and others. Country Coast to Coast in the early 1990s had the phone number 1(800) US-SONGS which later changed to 1(800) 457-6647; Starstation 1(800) 832-0208.\n\n<small> = Currently active on ABC Radio.\n"}

The film also features Joyce Grenfell, Keenan Wynn, and William Windom. The screenplay by Chayefsky is loosely adapted from the novel of the same name by William Bradford Huie, who had been a SeaBee officer during the Normandy Invasion. The film is set in 1944 London during World War II in the weeks leading up to D-Day.\n\nControversial in its own time, it has since been praised as a \"vanguard anti-war film\". Both Garner and Andrews have considered the film their personal favorite of those in which they acted.\n\nLieutenant Commander Charlie Madison (James Garner), United States Naval Reserve, is a cynical and highly efficient adjutant to Rear Admiral William Jessup (Melvyn Douglas) in London in 1944. Charlie's job as a dog robber is to keep his boss and other high-ranking officers supplied with luxury goods and amiable Englishwomen. He falls in love with a driver from the motor pool, Emily Barham (Julie Andrews), who has lost her husband, brother, and father in the war. Charlie's pleasure-seeking \"American\" lifestyle amid wartime rationing both fascinates and disgusts Emily, but she does not want to lose another loved one to war and finds the \"practising coward\" Charlie irresistible.\n\nProfoundly despondent since the death of his wife, Jessup obsesses over the US Army and its Air Force overshadowing the Navy in the forthcoming D-Day invasion. The mentally unstable admiral decides that \"The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor\". A combat film will document the death, and the casualty will be buried in a \"Tomb of the Unknown Sailor\". He orders Charlie to get the film made.\n\nDespite his best efforts to avoid the duty, Charlie and his now gung-ho friend, Commander \"Bus\" Cummings (James Coburn), find themselves and a film crew with the combat engineers, who will be the first sailors ashore. When Charlie tries to retreat from the beach, the manic Cummings shoots him in the leg with a Colt .45 pistol. A German artillery shell lands near the limping-running Charlie, making him the first American casualty on Omaha Beach. Hundreds of newspaper and magazine covers reprint the photograph of Charlie running ashore, alone (in reality trying to escape from Cummings), making him a war hero. Jessup, having recovered from his breakdown, is horrified by his part in Charlie's death. He plans to use the heroic death in support of the Navy when testifying before a Senate committee in Washington, D.C. Losing another man she loves to the war devastates Emily.\n\nThen comes unexpected news: Charlie is not dead, but alive at the Allied 6th relocation center in Southampton, England. A relieved Jessup plans to show him off during his Senate testimony as the \"first man on Omaha Beach,\" a \"sailor.\" Charlie, limping from his injury and angry about his senseless near-death, uncharacteristically plans to act nobly by telling the world the truth about what happened, even if it means being imprisoned for cowardice. By recounting what he had told her previously, Emily persuades Charlie to choose happiness with her, instead, and to keep quiet and accept his role as a hero.\n\nAccording to James Garner, William Holden was originally meant to play the lead role of \"Charlie\" Madison. Garner was originally selected to play the character \"Bus\" Cummings. When Holden backed out of the project, Garner took the lead role, and James Coburn was brought in to play \"Bus\".\n\nThe film introduced the song \"Emily\" which was composed by Johnny Mandel with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The song was recorded by Frank Sinatra with Nelson Riddle arranging and conducting on October 3, 1964 and included in the Reprise LP, \"Softly, as I Leave You\". It was later recorded by Andy Williams for \"Dear Heart\" (1965) and by Barbra Streisand for \"The Movie Album\" (2003).\n\n\"The Americanization of Emily\" is based on William Bradford Huie's 1959 novel of the same name. \"The New York Times\" ran a brief news item mentioning Huie's novel prior to its publication, but never reviewed the novel, although in 1963 Paddy Chayefsky's development of the novel into a screenplay was found worthy of note. A first draft of the screenplay for the film was written by George Goodman who previously had a success at MGM with his \"The Wheeler Dealers\" (1963), also with James Garner in the male lead and the same director and producer. In 1964 a Broadway musical with music written by John Barry was announced. Chayefsky's adaptation, while retaining the title, characters, situation, background and many specific plot incidents, nevertheless told a very different story. \"I found the book, which is serious in tone, essentially a funny satire, and that's how I'm treating it\".\n\nThe screenplay's theme of cowardice as a virtue has no parallel in the novel; in fact, the novel does not mention cowardice at all.\n\nThe screenplay implies, but never explicitly explains, what is meant by the term \"Americanization\". The novel uses \"Americanized\" to refer to a woman who accepts, as a normal condition of wartime, the exchange of her sexual favors for gifts of rare wartime commodities. Thus, in reply to the question \"has Pat been Americanized\", a character answers:\nThis theme runs throughout the novel. Another character says, \"We operate just like a whorehouse ... except we don't sell it for cash. We swap it for Camels and nylons and steak and eggs and lipstick ... this dress ... came from Saks Fifth Avenue in the diplomatic pouch\". Emily asks Jimmy, \"Am I behaving like a whore\"? Jimmy replies, \"Whoring is a peacetime activity\".\n\nThe screenplay uses Hershey bars to symbolize the luxuries enjoyed by Americans and their \"Americanized\" companions; the novel uses strawberries rather than chocolate bars, in a parallel way. In his first dinner with Emily, he orders the waiter to bring strawberries. \"She protested that they were too forbidden, too expensive\". Jimmy convinces her to accept them by arguing, \"If you don't eat them, they'll be eaten by one of these expense-account correspondents\". Later, she asks Jimmy, \"If I fall in love with you, how can I know whether I love you for yourself or for the strawberries?\"\n\nThe novel briefly mentions that Emily's mother, Mrs. Barham, has been mentally affected by wartime stress, but she is not a major character. There is no mention of her self-deception or pretense that her husband and son are still alive. The film contains a long scene between Charlie and Mrs. Barham, full of eloquent antiwar rhetoric, in which Charlie breaks down Mrs. Barham's denial and reduces her to tears while nevertheless insisting that he has performed an act of kindness. The novel has no parallel to this scene.\n\nIn the film, Charlie is comically unprepared to make the documentary film demanded by Admiral Jessup and is assisted only by a bumbling and drunken serviceman played by Keenan Wynn. In the novel Charlie has been a PR professional in civilian life, takes the assignment seriously, and leads a team of competent cinematographers.\n\n\"The Americanization of Emily\" has a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews, with an average score of 7.39/10. Bosley Crowther praised Chayefsky's screenplay as including \"some remarkably good writing with some slashing irreverence\". In \"Slant\" magazine, Nick Schager retrospectively wrote, \"Though a bit overstuffed with long-winded speeches, Chayefsky's scabrously funny script brims with snappy, crackling dialogue.\" In \"A Journey Through American Literature\", academic Kevin J. Hayes praised Chayefsky's speeches for Garner as \"stirring\".\n\nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1965, for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography, and in 1966 Julie Andrews' portrayal of Emily earned her a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best British Actress.\n\n\"The Americanization of Emily\" was among the films selected for \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\".\n\n\"The Americanization of Emily\" was released on Blu-ray by Warner Home Video on March 11, 2014 via Warner Archive.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1888435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888435", "title": "WRQN", "text": "WRQN\n\nWRQN is an American radio station licensed to broadcast from Bowling Green, Ohio. Though licensed to Bowling Green, its primary market and its studios are in the nearby city of Toledo. The station broadcasts at 93.5 on the FM dial, and plays classic hits music. Its transmitter is located near Haskins, Ohio.\n\nBefore becoming WRQN on July 11, 1983, the station was WAWR, founded by Port Clinton, Ohio resident Robert W. Reider. The station first went on the air on Wednesday, June 3, 1964. Reider eventually started and operated WAWR, WRWR in Port Clinton, WLKR in Norwalk, and WKTN in Kenton, all via his \"Ohio Radio Incorporated\" banner.\n\nWAWR programmed easy listening music during the day and rock in the evenings changing to contemporary rock and underground rock in the evenings with Bob Ladd, geared toward the college students at local BGSU. Earl Sharninghouse (aka Rick Allen) had the oldies weekend show playing 1950s and 1960s oldies in the evenings in the mid 1960s. Steve Wright held the morning slot with Terry Waltz anchoring the news and news director. Jim (Marick) Obrien worked part-time in production and occasional on air talent. General Manager Jerry (Tschappit) McCullen conducted local talks shows at local restaurants.\n\nEventually, the call sign was changed to WKIQ. When it became WRQN the station began as a Rock/Top 40 A.K.A. Rock 40 station as \"\"Toledo's New Hit Rock, The All New 93 And A 1/2 FM WRQN\"\", playing mix of artists like Robert Plant, The Motels, The Police, Donna Summer, Quarterflash, Air Supply, Culture Club and Billy Squier. The station later adopted a CHR format, calling itself \"\"Hit Rock, Hit Radio, 93Q\"\". Despite its weak signal and poor audio quality, the station became very successful and competed with then 92.5 WMHE. The daily on-air lineup included Mason, Diane and The Q Morning Zoo, Brad Hanson, Joseph \"Indiana Jones\" Thomas, Ted Kelly and Scott Greggory. Eventually former intern turned local personality favorite Johny D was heard in the evenings, hosting a show called \"Dial D\" in which most of the time was spent taking phone calls from listeners and rapping about anything the listeners wanted to talk about.\n\nAround 1990 the station boosted their transmitting power to 6,000 watts and improved their sound quality by switching to compact discs from the \"cart machine\". It also aired syndicated programs like \"Future Hits\", \"Casey's Top 40\", and \"Saturday Night Hot Mix\". The station also had its own program that aired on Sunday nights called \"\"93Q's On The Edge\"\" that played alternative rock that had not yet reached mainstream. But despite consistently beating 92.5 in the ratings, the station did not bill very well.\n\nOn October 17, 1991, instead of hearing The Q Morning Zoo, WRQN was playing \"Louie Louie\" by The Kingsmen over and over, similar to the way WHNN in Saginaw, Michigan did before it changed to an oldies format on Labor Day of 1990, referring to itself as \"Louie 93.5, All Louie, All the Time!\". The station also played a marching band rendition of the song during this stunting. On the following Monday, Mason and Diane returned to talk about the new format change to oldies. There was an enormous backlash from the listeners, many of them signing petitions demanding the return of 93Q.\n\nMason talked about this but said that they were \"fighting for a lost cause\", and that the station was not changing back. Mason and Diane remained at the station for a little while longer and then left. For majority of the 1990s the station was known as \"\"WRQN Oldies 93.5\"\", focusing on mostly music from the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nBy the 2000s WRQN began adding more 1970s classic hits and Motown, then WRQN removed most 1950s doo wop hits from their playlist. \n\nThe year 2006 saw even more improvements at WRQN-FM, as transmitter power was increased to 7,000 watts, a new tower was built, and the station was the first in the Toledo market to broadcast with IBOC / HD-Radio. Toledo radio legend Bob Kelly was inducted into the Ohio Radio Hall of Fame in October 2006. The current lineup at WRQN features long-time Toledo radio favorites Jim Brady, Ron Finn, Buddy Carr, as well as Bob Kelly with his new partner Becky Shock (replacing Bob's sidekick of 19 years, Dennis Staples).\n\nOn Friday, June 10, 2011, longtime radio host Bob Kelly retired, as did the morning show \"Bob and Becky\". The following Monday, June 13, 2011, a new morning show was introduced, \"Ron and Lyn\", formerly the morning show on WWWM-FM. Ron Finn previously hosted the 10a-2p shift on WRQN which former morning show personality, Becky Shock hosted for sometime. Finn's counterpart in the morning, Lyn Casye still aired on Star 105.5's new morning show, \"Tim and Jeff\" offering news, weather, and traffic updates. \n\nThen on Monday, June 13, 2011, WRQN slightly updated their programming. WRQN now advertises themselves as \"Feel Good Favorites\" and removed most 1960s hits from their playlist and added 1980s pop music hits to the playlist, including hits from George Michael, Prince, Soft Cell, Michael Jackson, Heart (band), Level 42, Mr. Mister and many others. Previously, WRQN offered \"Rock & Roll Hits\" mainly from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe Denny Schaffer Show\nWeekdays: 5:30 AM – 9:00 AM\n\nTimm Morrison \nWeekdays: 9:00 AM – 2:00 PM\n\nBecky Shock \nWeekdays: 2:00 PM – 7:00 PM\n\nBill Stewart\nWeekdays: 7:00 PM - Midnight\nSaturday: 3:00pm – 7:00pm\n\nBob Kelly\nSaturday 6am - 10am\n\nBuddy Carr\nSaturday: 10:00 AM – 3:00 PM\n\nJeff Larson\nSundays: 1:00PM – 6:00PM\n\nJohny D\nSundays: 6:00PM - 10:00PM\n\n"}

Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker. Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages.\n\nHomemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value. Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products.\n\nOrdinary methods for making soy milk at home are often very labor-intensive (requiring beans to be soaked, ground in a blender, strained, and then cooked). Soy milk machines perform many of these steps automatically, greatly simplifying home-based soy milk production.\n\nBefore use, dried beans are rinsed with water to remove particulate debris, soaked for 6–10 hours to moisten and soften the dried beans, and then rinsed again before use. The moistened soy beans are placed into the grinding chamber, where they are ground into a fine paste, and fall into a finely screened strainer chamber immersed in a pot of water.\n\nThe paste is steeped in the water in a process similar to that of tea making; the pot of water is heated, fully cooking both the dissolved soy milk and the strained soy solids, which become soy pulp. The new models on the market now have no filter cup — soy beans are placed directly inside the machine jug.\n\nMost soy milk makers include a mechanism to stop the boiling soy milk from overflowing. The heater is turned off as the water level approaches the top of the chamber, and then turned back on as the soy milk returns to an acceptable level. This process is repeated for the length of the cooking period, which lasts for approximately fifteen minutes.\n\nWhen the soy milk has fully cooked, the machine will automatically turn off, leaving the soy pulp in the filter cup and the soy milk in the water chamber. Many machines will beep to inform the user of the soy milk's completion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1888453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888453", "title": "The Mansion Family", "text": "The Mansion Family\n\n\"The Mansion Family\" is the twelfth episode of the eleventh season of the American animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 23, 2000, and was watched in around 11.3 million homes during the broadcast. In the episode, Mr. Burns goes to the Mayo Clinic for a check-up after being declared the oldest man in Springfield at an awards ceremony. He leaves the Simpson family to house-sit his mansion for him. When Homer throws a party on Burns' private yacht in international waters, the party goers are captured by Chinese pirates.\n\nAmerican pop singer Britney Spears guest starred in \"The Mansion Family\" as herself. She appears as the host of the awards ceremony. The episode, which was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Michael Polcino, features several cultural references. Many parts of the story were inspired by real-life events experienced by some of the staff members of the series. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received generally mixed reviews from critics. It was released on the DVD collection \"The Simpsons Gone Wild\" in 2004, and \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\" in 2008.\n\nAt the annual Springfield Pride Awards hosted by Kent Brockman and Britney Spears, awards are given to prominent Springfield citizens for their achievements. They present the award for the oldest man in Springfield to Cornelius Chapman, who is 108 years old. Chapman comes up to accept his award, but when Spears gives him a congratulatory kiss on the cheek, he dies of a heart attack. The award is therefore given to the now oldest Springfieldian in the crowd, Mr. Burns. After Burns wins, he realizes he is not a young man anymore, so he and his assistant Smithers go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for a check-up. Burns decides to give the Simpson family an opportunity to house sit his private mansion while he is being tested for various diseases.\n\nAfter enjoying life as a billionaire for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer that he can not sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told the only way he could buy alcohol would be to sail out to international waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.\n\nMeanwhile, the party continues and the party goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer and some of the other guests who happen to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning while the others who were beneath the net drowned. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.\n\n\"The Mansion Family\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Michael Polcino as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). It was the first of many episodes of the series that Polcino directed. Executive producer Mike Scully was the one who received the idea for the first part of the story. He explained on a DVD audio commentary for the episode that his grandmother was the oldest citizen of his hometown West Springfield, Massachusetts, and \"they had a ceremony where she was awarded a cane that had a golden head on it. And the weird thing of the ceremony is her name wasn't on the cane, and the mayor of the town stood up and he says: 'And now, of course as soon as Hazel passes away, her name will be engraved on the cane.' So she would never live to see it happen. But nonetheless, she was given the cane.\"\n\nThe subplot of \"The Mansion Family\", where Mr. Burns gets a medical examination, was inspired by Swartzwelder's own visit to a Mayo Clinic. George Meyer, an executive producer on the series, has said that \"John, I don't think is a guy who goes to the doctor very often. And every 20 or 30 years, he decides he needs to get a tune up. So he went to the Mayo Clinic, had they give him an entire battery of tests. And as John [jokingly] tells it, they said that his constant smoking had done no harm to him whatsoever. Might even be benefiting him.\" While writing the parts of the episode that involve international waters, the writers did research and found that the actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in the story, but they decided to ignore that.\n\nAmerican pop singer Britney Spears guest starred in the episode as herself. According to Scully, she was seventeen to eighteen years old when she recorded her lines, and \"She was a lot of fun to work with. She was a fan of the show, and she was willing to do all the lines. It was all the people around her that were crazy, the management and all that. We originally had her introduce herself [in the episode] as 'I'm teenage songbird Britney Spears.' And she recorded a few takes and they were fine. And suddenly, all these guys come rushing in [saying] 'She can't say songbird.' [We asked] what's wrong with songbird? And they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult.\" The staff members were therefore forced to change her opening line to \"I'm teen sensation Britney Spears.\"\n\nMany scenes in \"The Mansion Family\" were inspired by popular culture. For example, there is a painting hanging on one of the walls in Burns' mansion that depicts Burns playing poker with dogs, referencing the oil paintings series \"Dogs Playing Poker\". Another painting, showing a nude Burns, is a callback to a previous episode of the series, \"Brush with Greatness\" (1991), in which Marge produced the painting for Burns. Featured in the episode is also a joke that makes fun of the Grammy Awards. During the awards ceremony, Homer complains, \"Why won't anyone give me an award?\" When Lisa points out that \"You won a Grammy,\" Homer says \"I mean an award that's worth winning.\" At this point the screen freezes and a message scrolls across the bottom of the screen reading \"LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Mr. Simpson's opinions do not reflect those of the producers, who don't consider the Grammy an award at all.\"\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 23, 2000. \n\nIt was viewed in approximately 11.3 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 11.2, the episode tied \"Becker\" (CBS) for the 14th place (compared the season average of 37) in the ratings for the week of January 17–23, 2000. The episode was the third highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following a NFC Championship post-game show and \"Malcolm in the Middle\". \n\nOn September 14, 2004, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled \"The Simpsons Gone Wild\", along with the season one episode \"Homer's Night Out\", the season ten episode \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\", and the season thirteen episode \"Homer the Moe\". On October 7, 2008, \"The Mansion Family\" was released on DVD again as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ron Hauge, Matt Selman, Tim Long, Michael Polcino, Donick Cary, and Pete Michels participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\n\"The Mansion Family\" has received generally mixed reception from critics. \n\nSusan Dunne of \"The Hartford Courant\" described it as \"debauched but hilarious.\" \n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on \"The Mansion Family\", writing that \"Although \"The Simpsons\" started out as moderately reality based, pretty much any grounding was gone by [the point this episode aired]. That doesn’t mean the show fails to depict funny bits, especially during the dark humor of Burns’ hospital visit. Nonetheless, [the episode] occasionally goes too far to the side of silliness; those gags are hit or miss.\"\n\nIn a review of the episodes featured on \"The Simpsons Gone Wild\", PopMatters critic Stephen Haag wrote that \"none of these episodes will end up in the \"Simpsons\" Hall of Fame\", and that \"The Mansion Family\" is \"hardly a classic episode, but Lord knows there are plenty worse from season 11.\" He further commented that \"if anything, this episode should be included in the 'batshit-crazy endings' DVD,\" referring to the ending scenes with the Chinese pirates. \n\nDavid Packard of DVD Verdict was more positive in his review of \"The Simpsons Gone Wild\", writing that \"The Mansion Family\" is \"another all-around hilarious episode, with a nice swipe at the Grammy Awards, the Simpsons family running amok in the mansion and enjoying all it has to offer, and Burns' various tests at the Mayo Clinic (my favorite gag is when Burns is slid into an MRI machine, only to hear the thing grind to a halt with an error message reading 'Clear body jam in Area 1.')\"\n\n"}

It had 13 500 members by the beginning of 2019. Of the political youth organizations that received financial support from the Swedish National Board for Youth Affairs in 2009, it had the highest number of members.\n\nThe Moderate Youth League is more libertarian-leaning and more radical than the mother party. It is generally pro-market, pro-American, pro-Israeli and liberal in social issues such as abortion, gay rights and supports legalization of illegal file sharing and alcohol manufacturing for private, nonprofit purposes. Its official ideologies are liberalism and conservatism.\n\nThe Moderate Youth League was formed in 1934 as the Young Swedes (Swedish: \"Ungsvenskarna\") as a consequence of the split between the Moderate Party (then the \"General Electoral Union\") and its youth organization, the National Youth League of Sweden (Swedish: \"Sveriges nationella ungdomsförbund\") which had turned into an openly pro-Nazi organization. In 1946 the organization changed its name to the Youth Association of the Right (Swedish: \"Högerns ungdomsförbund\"). The current name was adopted in 1969.\n\nThe Moderate Youth League is led by a national executive committee, elected every two years at the national congress. The President is supported by two vice-chairmen. Normally, members of the national executive have served at district level first. The current chairman, for example, used to be chairman of the Stockholm district. The national chairman also sits on the national board of the Moderate Party.\n\nDistricts follow county borders. The largest one is Stockholm, followed by Skåne. They maintain a rivalry, sometimes staging competitions on who can recruit the most members. Other large districts include Uppsala and Östergötland.\n\nThe Young Conservative Moderates (\"Unga konservativa moderater\") are an internal faction of the Moderate Youth League. It was founded in 2004 as \"Mörkblått värn\" (literally Dark-Blue Defence), but changed to its current name after the founder left to join the Christian Democrats. Young Conservative Moderates seek to promote a conservative alternative to the current dominance of liberalism within the organisation. The organisation compromises both traditionalists and neoconservatives.\n\nThe Moderate School Youth (\"Moderat skolungdom\", MSU) is a part of the organisation and includes all MUF members between 12 and 20 years of age.\n\nAt the annual conference, a national executive is elected. They are not decision-makers but more of an elite campaigning team which travel around Sweden. The national chairman has a place on the national executive of the Youth League. The current chairman, since 2020, is Rebecca Nordin Vainio.\n\nIn 2008, the Moderate Students was founded as a student network within the Moderate Youth League and it has since then grown to become the largest student political organization in Sweden. It is the official student organization of the Moderate Youth League, the youth wing of the Swedish Moderate Party.\n\nModerate Students is a national organization consisting of student associations on various universities and campuses in Sweden. Individual membership is sorted by district. Moderate Students originally existed as a party in the student union at Lund University, before the union was dissolved in 1998. Today, the Moderate Students exist as parties at other universities, such as Uppsala University and Umeå University.\n\nModerate Students focuses primarily on students' economical situations. They have advocated for an extended \"work-tax reduction\" for young people () and for removing taxes on work and studies in general. They specifically want to repeal the tax on students who take out a student loan and work in addition to their studies. They have also become involved in discussions about the availability of student housing.\n\nThe 2009 Moderate Students national board consisted of chairman Caroline Garsbo, first vice chairman Jonas Grafström, second vice chairman Anna Alriksson, Erik Persson, Pirita Isegran, and Cecilia Hellgren.\n\nThe 2010 board was led by chairman Erik Persson and first vice chairman Michael Wigg. Additional members included Lars Hindrum, Ida Drougge, Evelina Kogsta, and Péteris Timofejevs Henriksson.\n\nThe 2011 board was led by chairman Ida Drougge, first vice chairman Andrea Ström, and second vice chairman Alexandra Westman. Additional members included Evelina Kogsta, Erik Raita, Simon Vallin, and Petter Krönmark.\n\nThe 2012 board was chaired by Andrea Ström, with Filip Solsjö and Olivia Andersson serving as first and second vice chairmen, respectively. Additional members included Jeanette Widén, Erik Gestrinius, Therese Lindström, and Clara Enocson.\n\nThe 2014 board, was chaired by Benjamin Dousa, with Armend Dushica and Annie Widerberg serving as first and second vice chairmen, respectively. Additional members included Caroline Jarbratt, Mikael Persson, Jesper Skalberg Karlsson and Denice Sigvardsson.\n\nThe 2015 board, was chaired by Benjamin Dousa, with Sofia Axelsson and John Eklöf serving as first and second vice chairmen, respectively. Additional members included Jonas Jesslén, Ina Djureståhl, Sara Elingfors and Denice Sigvardsson.\n\nThe 2016 board, was chaired by Ina Djurestål, with Klas Vestergren and Sofia Lindbom serving as first and second vice chairmen, respectively.

Additional members include Baran Calisir, Sarah Ullmark, Clara Albinsson and John Backvid.\n\nThe 2018 board, was chaired by Greta Eulau, with Kristoffer Sundström and Roosa Porthén serving as first and second vice chairmen, respectively.

Additional members include Niklas Törnå, Ludvig Berggren, Madelene Nord and Linus Lindeblom.\n\nThe following Swedish universities have chapters of Moderate Students.\nUnder many years the Moderate Party did not have any official student organisation. The Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students (\"Fria moderata studentförbundet\", FMSF) was dislodged from the party because of its radical neoliberalism. Therefore, many students join the Youth League instead. This results in the age of members spanning the whole age-spectrum from roughly 15 to 30. There is, however, widespread cross-membership between the youth and student leagues. In Uppsala, a traditional student town, the radicalism of the Student League has also spread to the local MUF district due to almost all local leaders also being active in the Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students.\n\nNaturally many current politicians of the Moderate Party, started their careers in the Youth League. The most famous being the current leader of the party, Fredrik Reinfeldt, who is a former chairman. The last chairman, Christofer Fjellner, was elected to the European Parliament before resigning from his Youth League position. The Moderate Youth League played a great part in this, lobbying for him inside the party and campaigning for him in the election. In 2002, Tove Lifvendahl became the first Youth League chairman to be elected to the national board of the party directly after resigning from the Moderate Youth League. Many former leaders left politics but gained prominence in other spheres of society, most of all in business.\n\nThe Moderate Youth League has around 9,500 members (2004/2005).\n\nThe Moderate Youth League defines its ideology in four statements. Apart from these, the Youth League publishes no manifestos or political programmes of any sort. These are:\n\n\nThe modern Moderate Youth League are staunch supporters of capitalism, deregulation and lower taxes. They also adhere to individualism, which extends to wide-reaching support for gay rights. The League supports free trade, free immigration and wants to abolish foreign aid.\n\nLike its opponents in the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, the Moderate Youth League has suffered from divisions between different factions. The 1990s saw many battles between modernising neoliberals and conservatives. At the congress in Lycksele in 1992, Fredrik Reinfeldt, the former leader between 25 October 2003 – 10 January 2015 of Moderate Party, was elected chairman, defeating the neoliberal Ulf Kristersson. In recent years, however, the division have largely disappeared. With the Moderates becoming more cosmopolitan, the traditionalist Conservatives have all but disappeared. Gay rights were a source of division, but now almost all of the Moderate Youth League supports equal rights of marriage and adoption for homosexuals. A conservative fringe group, however, was formed – Young Conservative Moderates (\"Unga konservativa moderater\") – but did not gain widespread membership.\n\nIn foreign policy, MUF tends to support the United States, including the 2003 Iraq War and Swedish NATO membership. Chairwoman Tove Lifvendahl proudly wore an \"I love Bush\" shirt after George W. Bush's election in 2000, although she was quick to criticise him for the steel tariffs he later imposed. It is also strongly supportive of Israel. Though generally supportive of the European Union, the Youth League does not support Sweden adopting the euro.\n\n"}

Formed in 2003, the band broke up in 2008 then briefly reunited in 2010. On February 18th 2020, the band announced a brief reunion tour.\n\nThe band played on the 2005 Warped Tour and has toured with such acts as Gatsbys American Dream, A Wilhelm Scream, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Funeral for a Friend, Saves the Day, Senses Fail, Thrice, and New Found Glory. The band's first headlining tour, \"The New Hope Tour,\" began on March 31, 2006. About a week before the start of the tour, guitarist/vocalist Alex fell down a flight of stairs, breaking his scapula, two ribs and puncturing his lung. A question of whether or not he would be able to perform arose, yet he pulled through. Some of the bands who supported The Receiving End of Sirens on their first headlining tour were As Tall as Lions, A Thorn for Every Heart, Hit the Lights and I Am the Avalanche.\n\nOn March 18, 2008 the band announced that it would \"no longer exist in the way it has for the past 5 years\" on their MySpace page. The main reason for the breakup was the fact that Brendan had a child in January, and he decided he needed to reassess his priorities. In a MySpace bulletin he claimed that all of the members still keep a passion for music and the love for their fans. The band played two of their last three last shows at Lupo's in Providence, Rhode Island on May 2, supported by Envy on the Coast and Therefore I Am, and The Bamboozle Festival in East Rutherford, New Jersey on May 4. On May 5, a final farewell was performed under the pseudonym The Red Eye of Soromon at Harper's Ferry in Allston, Massachusetts.\n\nAccording to drummer Andrew Cook:\n\"I was a cook at a place called McCarthy's Pub in Massachusetts. A bunch of police cars and ambulances went screaming by and the name popped in my head. Like, thinking about how people never really think what's 'on the receiving end of sirens,' because its such a common thing just to hear the sirens. Especially if you live in a city, it just becomes this commonplace thing, nobody thinks twice about it anymore. Even though there's so much awful stuff going on in the world, and horrible things that happen to people, it's kind of like 'out of sight, out of mind.' It's just kind of a sad thing. So it's kind of a commentary on that. It also works on a couple levels. It can be taken as the Greek mythology example with the Sirens that lure sailors in with their singing, so being on the receiving end of those sirens isn't a great thing. It works both ways.\"\n\nThe band has also been known to perform under the pseudonym The Red Eye of Soromon , or, if abbreviated, TREOS. Andrew explained the name change in an interview for www.drivenfaroff.com:\n\"Sometimes we just feel like playing a show near home and not announcing it as a TREOS show, just keeping it small and intimate and stuff. And you know, when you play a lot of shows you have to worry about your draw, and a lot of bands will purposefully not play their hometown area for a long time to build up a draw. It’s something that every band needs to be conscious of. And for us, we got to thinking, “We haven’t played a show in Massachusetts for a long time, kind of purposefully “we need to give ourselves a break and not saturate the market so people don’t care about seeing us anymore,” you know? And it got to the point where like, “Man, we miss playing hall shows and stuff. Let’s just do one,” and we talked to Alex from Therefore I Am because we love those guys and love playing with them, and worked it out. He set up the show and it just worked out great. People have caught on and every time they see The Red Eye of Soromon they’re obviously going to know it’s us, but it’s just something to do to be fun, you know, just be goofy about it, show people that we don’t take ourselves too seriously and that we still love playing shows like this. Playing big shows is great, playing big clubs is great, but it loses something at that level, you know? And it’s not as intimate and off-the-cuff and random as shows like these, and we love doing it, so we’re going to keep doing it as long as we’re a band, regardless of how well or how poorly the band does from here on out.\" The most recent performance under the pseudonym was on May 16, 2012.\n\nThe band formed in 2003, and their original lineup consisted of Brendan Brown, Alex Bars, Andrew Cook, Nate Patterson, and Ben Potrykus, formerly of Massachusetts pop-punk band Fake-ID. With this lineup they recorded two demos with a total of five songs, including two versions of \"The Race\", and gained a following throughout New England. After a conflict of interest involving the future of the band and their signing with a record label, Ben left the band. They played their last show with this lineup on November 8, 2003 in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter almost 6 months on hiatus the band came back to life with their new member Casey Crescenzo. They played their first show with the new lineup on April 20, 2004 in Amherst, Massachusetts. Their new lineup featured three-tiered vocals split by Crescenzo, Bars, and Brown, and the addition of keyboards and synth. At this time they also released their self-titled five-song EP.\n\nIn April 2005 their full-length album \"Between the Heart and the Synapse\" was released.\n\nAfter a year of touring, Casey Crescenzo left the band in May 2006 and started pursuing his side project, The Dear Hunter, full-time. After Crescenzo's departure, long-time friend of the band Ross filled in on guitar during their tour with Circa Survive and most notably at radio station WFNX \"Disorientation\" free concert in Boston featuring TREOS and Taking Back Sunday.\n\nOn November 6, 2006, the band announced their new permanent member as Brian Southall (formerly the drummer of Boys Night Out). He plays guitar, keys, and backup vocals.\n\nTheir second album \"The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi\" was released on August 7, 2007. The band had arranged to stream a live concert from Vintage Vinyl Record Store in New Jersey on the new real-time entertainment site www.Yebotv.com on August 9, 2007.\n\nOn March 18, 2008, Brendan Brown announced via a MySpace bulletin that because of his new priorities (having a baby), the band is coming to an end.\n\nOn Friday May 2, 2008 the band played its farewell show with Envy on the Coast and Therefore I Am. Casey Crescenzo made a return halfway through the set. TREOS performed virtually all of their tracks, forcing them to repeat Planning a Prison Break as their encore. They headlined in Providence, Rhode Island. Absolute Punk wrote that \"They played 21 songs (technically 22 because the crowd got them to play \"Planning a Prison Break\" twice) – almost every track spanning their three CD discography.\"\n\nThe band also played The Bamboozle on May 4, 2008 and performed their final show as The Red Eye of Soromon in Allston, MA on May 5, 2008, where they played all of \"Between the Heart and the Synapse\" in order from start to finish, with Casey, followed by an encore set.\n\nThe band recorded their farewell show at Lupo's on May 2, 2008, however, there has been no announcement stating a release date. Along with concert footage, the DVD will contain never-before-seen interviews, as well as backstage footage from many of the band's tours. The live concert footage will span twenty-two songs and will feature Casey Crescenzo for the latter half of the performance.\n\nAfter the breakup of The Receiving End of Sirens Brian Southall begun working on a new project titled The Company We Keep.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, the band posted a video of \"Planning a Prison Break\" live from their May 2 show. This hints that a DVD may be officially announced in the near future. On June 6, 2009, the first news pointing towards a closer release date was found at absolutepunk, where TREOS asked for fans to send in pictures of them with the band. The rumors of a DVD were confirmed when the latest video was posted on the official Skatefest website, in which members of TREOS discuss the DVD.\n\nOn December 22, 2009, Brian Southall confirmed that TREOS would be reuniting to play Skate Fest 2010 in Worcester, MA. The Skate Fest web page was updated with a previously unreleased video of \"The War of All Against All\" from the farewell show in Providence. Casey Crescenzo confirmed that he would once again be joining the band on stage at Skate Fest.\n\nThe band played one more show before Skatefest at Jerky's in Providence, RI. The flyer for the show read \"The Real Eve Of Skatefest\"(a backronym for TREOS) and included the bands Envy on the Coast, All the Day Holiday, Lions Lions, and a special unannounced guest.\n\nIn late 2010, several members of the band began hinting that they were recording new songs, via Twitter. Brian Southall, Brendan Brown, Andrew Cook and Nate Patterson have all replied to each other's tweets, often capitalizing the letters \"T-R-E-O-S\" in each tweet, such as Southall's post, \"tracking guitars, This Really Epic Original Song i wrote with some friends a few months ago.\"\n\nTriple Crowns Records later confirmed that they will be re-releasing Between the Heart and the Synapse as a double LP along with a new song by the band and live videos. The members have been taking time off from their current projects to write and record the new song for the release. John D, creator of The Bamboozle Festival, announced that they will be playing the 2012 festival on Friday, May 18 in Asbury Park, New Jersey for the festival's 10th anniversary.\n\nTREOS (under the pseudonym \"The Red Eye of Soromon\") played The Middle East night club in Cambridge, MA on May 16, 2012.\n\nOn February 17, 2020, the band's official Twitter page announced a tour with Envy on the Coast.\n\nAndrew Cook is currently a full-time touring drummer for country act Dan + Shay.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1888469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888469", "title": "Dead Inside (game)", "text": "Dead Inside (game)\n\nDead Inside is a horror/fantasy role-playing game published by Atomic Sock Monkey Press based around the concept of characters who have lost or were born without their souls. These \"Dead Inside\" strive to regain or rebuild their souls. The game provides a variety of means by which souls may be lost, stolen, traded, regained or rebuilt.\n\nThe game is considered unusual for its attempt to reverse the typical \"Kill monsters and take their stuff\" path to power found in most RPGs and replace it with the \"Heal people and give them stuff\" concept. Essentially, selfless and noble actions by the characters are rewarded with Soul Points, the measure of a character's soul integrity. These Soul Points can be used to fuel metaphysical powers or to improve a character's abilities, much as experience points are used in other RPGs.\n\n\"Dead Inside\" won the People's Choice Award in the 2004 Indie RPG Awards.\n\n\"Dead Inside\" is chiefly divided into two realms – the stable, modern-day \"Real World\" and the dreamlike, mercurial \"Spirit World\".\n\nThe \"Real World\" is familiar and mostly devoid of the supernatural, at least on the surface (all supernatural powers and abilities in the game are weak and very difficult to use there). Its main denizens are \"Average People\" – those who own their original soul, who are incapable of visiting the Spirit World or perceiving the supernatural.\n\nThe \"Spirit World\" is an ever shifting dreamscape. Its geography is hard to pin down, but consists of five chief areas: the Wood in the East, the Waste in the South, the Mists in the North, the Sea to the West, and in the center, The City.\n\nAcross the Sea (although direction has little real meaning in the Spirit World) lies the Source; the centre of the cosmos from which all souls are born and to which they return after death.\n\nOutside of this whole lies the Void, a limitless expanse of utter nothingness, into which any soul is lost forever. It is said that the Real World protects the Spirit World and Source from the Void much as the shell of an egg protects the yolk.\n\nThe Real and Spirit Worlds may be travelled between by the supernaturally aware via \"Gates\": shimmering portals between the realms that can be opened by those who know how. It is impossible to travel to the Source short of death; or at least, no-one who has ever attempted the trip has returned.\n\nThe concept of Soul is key to Dead Inside. It is key to one's spiritual well-being – beings without enough soul (like the Dead Inside) feel a strong sense of loss, of being empty, which manifests as physical and emotional desensitivity, depression, even pain. Those with plenty of soul, conversely, are dynamic, energetic and full of life.\n\nSoul is also a valuable resource and commodity. It can be expended to use supernatural Abilities and Powers, it can be traded and it can even be stolen.\n\nIt is also a moral barometer – different actions are regarded as either 'soul-cultivating' or 'soul rotting'. In this way it is possible to gain or lose soul based purely upon how your character acts, although the justification for action is also important. Players are thus encouraged to role-play in a selfless and virtuous manner, and also to explain 'why' their characters act in the way they do.\n\nIn the mechanics of the game, your amount of soul is expressed as \"Soul Points\".\n\nThe game features a wide variety of types of characters, most of which are suitable for use by players (depending on the power level desired). They include:\n\nPeople with exactly the right amount of soul, such that they have a thickened spiritual \"shell\" around themselves. Due to this spiritual health, they are protected from (but also blinded to) most forms of supernatural influence. Their souls can be stolen by cracking the \"shell\" (although this is difficult), or they can be traded away with the owner's consent (easier). An Average Person who loses their soul for whatever reason becomes Dead Inside.\n\nBeings who lack a complete soul. As they lack the \"shell\" of Average People, the Dead Inside are aware of the supernatural; however, they lack the spiritual resources to make frequent use of supernatural powers. Instead, most Dead Inside seek to regain their old souls, or build new ones. If they are successful in this endeavour and they manage to 'ensoul', they will become Sensitives. If, however, they lose their last shards of a soul, they will become Qlippoth.\n\nBeings with more than enough soul, Sensitives are vibrant individuals. Their surfeit of soulstuff allows them to use supernatural abilities more often, but not greatly so. Sensitives may be helpers, seeking to aid the Dead Inside and other beings. Others are less selfless - some remain happy with their lot; still others go on to seek further power by becoming Magi.\n\nBeings with a double soul (that is, twice as much as an average person), Magi possess significant spiritual power, of which they will make frequent use.\n\nDead bodies lacking souls, Zombis possess only just enough spiritual force to keep them preserved and animated. As such, they become emotionless, cold beings. They are not stupid or slow, however - their cold rationality and force of will mean they are often smart, skilled and strong, and many have had centuries of existence to practice. Dead Inside become Zombis when they die, and the death of a Mage will also create a Zombi (as well as a Ghost). Zombis can also lose their last shreds of a soul. If they are in the real world, they stop moving, and finally appear to be dead. If they lose these shreds in the Spiritual World, they become Qlippoth.\n\nDead souls lacking bodies are ordinarily called back to the Source; however, some remain in the Worlds (both Real and Spirit), usually due to some ties they still have to their previous existence. These beings are Ghosts.\n\nBeings that no longer have any trace of a soul. They hate everything and wish for the destruction of the Source to end their suffering. They consume souls to ease their suffering. All others revile Qlippoths as abominations.\n\nThe game was created by Chad Underkoffler and is produced by Atomic Sock Monkey Press, a small-press RPG company.\n"}

It is generally referred to as the Irish Sweepstake, frequently abbreviated to Irish Sweeps or Irish Sweep. The Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1930 was the act that established the lottery; as this act expired in 1934, in accordance with its terms, the Public Hospitals Acts were the legislative basis for the scheme thereafter. The main organisers were Richard Duggan, Captain Spencer Freeman and Joe McGrath. Duggan was a well known Dublin bookmaker who had organised a number of sweepstakes in the decade prior to setting up the Hospitals' Sweepstake. Captain Freeman was a Welsh-born engineer and former captain in the British Army. After the Constitution of Ireland was enacted in 1937, the name \"Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake\" was adopted.\n\nThe sweepstake was established because there was a need for investment in hospitals and medical services and the public finances were unable to meet this expense at the time. As the people of Ireland were unable to raise sufficient funds, because of the low population, a significant amount of the funds were raised in the United Kingdom and United States, often among the emigrant Irish. Potentially winning tickets were drawn from rotating drums, usually by nurses in uniform. Each such ticket was assigned to a horse expected to run in one of several horse races, including the Cambridgeshire Handicap, Derby and Grand National. Tickets that drew the favourite horses thus stood a higher likelihood of winning and a series of winning horses had to be chosen on the accumulator system, allowing for enormous prizes.\nThe original sweepstake draws were held at The Mansion House, Dublin on 19 May 1939 under the supervision of the Chief Commissioner of Police, and were moved to the more permanent fixture at the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) in Ballsbridge later in 1940.\n\nThe Adelaide Hospital in Dublin was the only hospital at the time not to accept money from the Hospitals Trust, as the governors disapproved of sweepstakes.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, revenues declined. The offices were moved to Lotamore House in Cork. Although giving the appearance of a public charitable lottery, with nurses featured prominently in the advertising and drawings, the Sweepstake was in fact a private for-profit lottery company, and the owners were paid substantial dividends from the profits. \"Fortune Magazine\" described it as \"a private company run for profit and its handful of stockholders have used their earnings from the sweepstakes to build a group of industrial enterprises that loom quite large in the modest Irish economy. Waterford Glass, Irish Glass Bottle Company and many other new Irish companies were financed by money from this enterprise and up to 5,000 people were given jobs.\" By his death in 1966, Joe McGrath had interests in the racing industry, and held the Renault dealership for Ireland besides large financial and property assets. He was known throughout Ireland for his tough business attitude but also by his generous spirit. At that time, Ireland was still one of the poorer countries in Europe; he believed in investment in Ireland. His home, Cabinteely House, was donated to the state in 1986. The house and the surrounding park are now in the ownership of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council who have invested in restoring and maintaining the house and grounds as a public park.\n\nIn 1986, the Irish government created a new public lottery, and the company failed to secure the new contract to manage it. The final sweepstake was held in January 1986 and the company was unsuccessful for a licence bid for the Irish National Lottery, which was won by An Post later that year. The company went into voluntary liquidation in March 1987. The majority of workers did not have a pension scheme but the sweepstake had fed many families during lean times and was regarded as a safe job. The Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1990 was enacted for the orderly winding up of the scheme, which had by then almost £500,000 in unclaimed prizes and accrued interest.\n\nA collection of advertising material relating to the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes is among the Special Collections of National Irish Visual Arts Library. \n\nAt the time of the Sweepstake's inception, lotteries were generally illegal in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In the absence of other readily available lotteries, the Irish Sweeps became popular. Even though tickets were illegal outside Ireland, millions were sold in the US and Great Britain. How many of these tickets failed to make it back for the drawing is unknown. The United States Customs Service alone confiscated and destroyed several million s from shipments being returned to Ireland.\n\nIn the UK, the sweepstakes caused some strain in Anglo-Irish relations, and the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934 was passed by the parliament of the UK to prevent export and import of lottery related materials. The United States Congress had outlawed the use of the US Postal Service for lottery purposes in 1890. A thriving black market sprang up for tickets in both jurisdictions.\n\nFrom the 1950s onwards, as the American, British and Canadian governments relaxed their attitudes towards this form of gambling, and went into the lottery business themselves, the Irish Sweeps, never legal in the United States, declined in popularity.\n\n\nPhotographs taken in 1939 of the Irish Sweepstake Building, Ballsbridge, Dublin; from the collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects:\n\n"}

He lived during the transitional period from the Northern Song to the Southern Song, and was instrumental in the early history of the Chinese landscape art style known as shan shui.\n\nIn terms of historical significance, Zhang's original painting of the \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\" reveals much about life in China during the 11th-12th century. Its myriad depictions of different people interacting with one another reveals the nuances of class structure and the many hardships of urban life as well. It also displays accurate depictions of technological practices found in Song China. For example, it depicts one river ship lowering its bipod mast before passing under the prominent bridge of the painting. It shows ships in two major types, yet all of which have slung rudders for steering; the painting depicts freighters with narrow sterns or passenger boats and smaller craft with broad sterns, sailing upriver or docked along the banks while loading and unloading goods. Large stern sweeps and bow sweeps can be seen on at least three of the river ships, worked by up to eight men each. It also shows how personal gardens had begun to take root in China—in addition to the immense walled garden on the far left of the scroll, for example, one sees several private gardens with their man-made mountains and rockery (for example, the small private garden close to the city gate, squeezed between a chemist's shop and a large building selling furniture, consisting of a small pond surrounded by trees and bamboo).\n\n\n\n"}

Ross Robertson Cup are three championship trophies for ice hockey champions in Ontario, Canada. The trophies were donated by and named for John Ross Robertson, the president of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) who served from 1899 to 1905. Robertson donated three trophies to the OHA; one for junior-level, one for intermediate and a third for senior-level.\n\nThe junior-level trophy is awarded annually to the playoff champion of the Ontario Hockey League. Originally it was awarded to the winner of the OHA's junior playoffs. In 1933–34 it was redesignated for annual presentation to the association's Junior A champion. The first Junior A winners were the Toronto St. Michael's Majors. When the top junior level in Ontario was again separated into two categories in 1972–73 \"(see:OHA Major Junior A series)\", the Robertson Cup remained with the higher tier as its championship trophy. This has remained constant through the series changing its name to the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League in 1974 and to the Ontario Hockey League in 1980.\n\nThe intermediate-level trophy was awarded to the OHA intermediate champion until 1934, when the OHA discontinued the intermediate-level. The intermediate-level was composed of senior-age teams that were considered one level lower in stature than the senior-level, and not eligible for Canadian championships.\nThe senior-level trophy was donated in 1898, it is the oldest of the three. It was first won by Queen's University of Kingston, Ontario in 1899. Today, it is awarded to the champion of the Allan Cup Hockey league, (also known as \"OHA Senior AAA\").\n\nFor the 1933–34 season, OHA junior teams were divided into 'A' and 'B' levels. The J. Ross Robertson Cup was awarded to the playoff champions of OHA junior 'A' teams from this time forward.\n\n\n\n"}

Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken. The opposite and much more common type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called thixotropy.\n\nExamples of rheopectic fluids include gypsum pastes and printer inks. In the body synovial fluid exhibits the extraordinary property of inverse thixotropy or rheopexy.\n\nThere is ongoing research into new ways to make and use rheopectic materials. There is great interest in possible military uses of this technology. Moreover, the high end of the sports market has also begun to respond to it. Body armor and combat vehicle armor are key areas where efforts are being made to use rheopectic materials. Work is also being done to use these materials in other kinds of protective equipment, which is seen as potentially useful to reduce apparent impact stress in athletics, motor sports, transportation accidents, and all forms of parachuting. In particular, footwear with rheopectic shock absorption is being pursued as a dual-use technology that can provide better support to those who must frequently run, leap, climb, or descend.\n\nAn incorrect example often used to demonstrate rheopecty is cornstarch mixed with water, which is a very viscous, white fluid. It is a cheap and simple demonstrator, which can be picked up by hand as a semi-solid, but flows easily when not under pressure. However, cornstarch in water is actually a dilatant fluid, since it does not show the time-dependent, shear-induced change required in order to be labeled rheopectic. These terms are often and easily confused since the terms are rarely used; a true rheopectic fluid would when shaken be liquid at first, becoming thicker as shaking continued.\n\nJust as the opposite behaviour of becoming thinner with time is thixotropism (time dependent pseudoplastic behaviour), rheopectic behaviour may be described as time-dependent dilatant behaviour.\n"}

That statute was amended by decrees of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 7 May 1936, of 19 June 1943, of 26 February 1946, of 15 October 1947, of 16 December 1947 and by decree No 1803-X of 28 March 1980.\n\nThe Order of the Red Star was awarded to soldiers of the Soviet Army, Navy, border and internal security forces, employees of the State Security Committee of the USSR, as well as NCOs and officers of the bodies of internal affairs; to units, warships, associations, enterprises, institutions and organizations; as well as to military personnel of foreign countries:\n\nThe Order of the Red Star is worn on the right side of the chest and when in the presence of other orders of the USSR, placed immediately after the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class. If worn in the presence of Orders or medals of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.\n\nThe Order of the Red Star was also used as a long service award from 1944 to 1958 to mark fifteen years of service in the military, state security, or police. Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 14 September 1957 emphasised the devaluation of certain Soviet high military Orders used as long service awards instead of their originally intended criteria. This led to the joint 25 January 1958 decree of the Ministers of Defence, of Internal Affairs and of the Chairman of the Committee on State Security of the USSR establishing the Medal \"For Impeccable Service\" putting an end to the practice.\n\nThe Order of the Red Star is a red enamelled 47mm to 50mm wide (depending on the variant) silver five pointed star. In the center of the obverse, an oxydised silver shield bearing the image of an erect soldier wearing an overcoat and carrying a rifle, along the shield's entire circumference, a narrow band bearing the Communist motto in relief, \"Workers of the world, unite!\" (), the band below the soldier bore the relief inscription \"USSR\" (). Below the shield, the hammer and sickle also of oxydised silver. The otherwise plain reverse bore the maker's mark and the award serial number. The Order was attached to clothing by a threaded stud and screw attachment.\n\nWhen the order wasn't worn, a ribbon could be worn in its stead on the ribbon bar on the left side of the chest. The ribbon of the Order of the red Star was a 24mm wide silk moiré dark red with a 5mm wide central silver stripe.\n\nThe Order of the Red Star was awarded 6 times to 5 people, 5 times to more than 15 people, four times to more than 150 people, three times to more than 1,000 people. Below is a short partial list of such multiple recipients:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015 the Order of the Red Star award awarded to Ukrainian army units were removed as part of a removal of Soviet awards and decorations from Ukrainian military units.\n\n"}

{"id": "1888510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888510", "title": "Mount Merrion", "text": "Mount Merrion\n\nMount Merrion () is an affluent suburban area of Dublin, Ireland. It is roughly 7 kilometres (5 mi) south of Dublin city centre and is situated on and around the hill of the same name.\n\nMount Merrion is 3 kilometres (2 mi) southwest of the area known as Merrion and 5.6 km west of Dún Laoghaire. With its close proximity to University College Dublin at Belfield, many students live in the area. As one drives South from the city centre, Mount Merrion is the first neighbourhood of any significant elevation above sea level. \n\nThe main road in Mount Merrion is Deerpark Road, which has two restaurants, a newsagents, a motor company and engineer, a barber shop, a chemist, a salon, a dentist, a Christian church and a school (Scoil San Treasa).\n\nThe main artery through the area is the N11 dual carriageway.\n\nPublic transport is provided by Dublin Bus on routes 7b, 7d, 17, 46a, 46e, 47, 116, 118 and 145. The nearest DART station to Mount Merrion is Blackrock, while the nearest Luas stations are Kilmacud and Stillorgan on the Green line.\n\nThe Aircoach services to Dublin Airport from Greystones calls at South Hill Avenue en route to the airport.\n\nQuoting from \"Mount Merrion the Old\", by Sir Neville Wilkinson:\n\n\"Between the Convent of Mount Anville, above Dundrum, and the broad high road which leads to Stillorgan, rises the wooded hill of Mount Merrion, the centre of the landscape over Dublin Bay, which gradually becomes defined as the opalescent mists of the Irish sunrise fade away.\"\n\"It is a landscape known to every visitor to Ireland who has stood on deck as the Holyhead mail steamer passes the Kish lightship. Around the wood some 1.2 km² (300 acres) of the richest grazing land in County Dublin slope gently to the high stone wall which surrounds the demesne. To the south and south-west the horizon is bounded by the swelling outline of the Wicklow and Dublin Hills. To the north the long low line of the Mourne Mountains, 100 kilometres (60 mi) and more away, are clearly visible when recent rains have left the washed air clear, while the islands of Lambay and Ireland's Eye give an added beauty to the sea-scape which lies beyond the wind-blown causeway which leads on and up to the rhododendron covered slopes above the ancient castle of Howth.\"\n\"A double avenue of beech trees shades the roadway which runs, straight as a rule, for a full quarter of a mile to the entrance gates on the Stillorgan Road. This roadway, whose immaculate pebbled surface was raked daily, had a broad border of century old shaven turf, the pride of the Scottish gardener; so tended, brushed and rolled was it in those days that the most careless visitor would have hesitated to sully the velvety perfection of the surface with a profane foot. Yet the gardener, his voice, with its rich Highland brogue quivering with fury at the bare recollection, would tell how a distinguished citizen of Dublin, having ridden to pay his respects to his lordship, had, on departing, cantered gaily down the sacred border, divots flying from his horse's heels; so that the whole length was scarred and pitted with hoofmarks, as though the plague had passed over it, and it was only after months of patient labour that the unbroken serenity of the surface was restored.\"\n\nThe lands came into the possession of the Norman Fitzwilliam family in the 14th century. The family was originally based in Dundrum having come to Ireland in the year 1210.\n\nThe Fitzwilliams built Merrion Castle on lands which are today the property of the Sisters of Charity and St Mary's Home and School for the Blind. Merrion features on the 1598 map \"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\" by Abraham Ortelius as \"Mergon\".\n\nBy 1710 the castle was in such a bad state of repair that Richard, the 5th Viscount Fitzwilliam, selected 100 acres (0.4 km²) on which he built Mount Merrion House, surrounding the house by an granite wall. The house was completed in 1711 and served as a new seat by the 5th Viscount Fitzwilliam on the hill at Mount Merrion. The Fitzwilliam family left for England around 1726. Although the family no longer lived in Mount Merrion House, they retained possession of it, and rented the house out.\n\nThe next Fitzwilliam to take a major interest in Mount Merrion was Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam, who remained a bachelor all his life. It was he who willed £100,000 to build the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, his former university. Prior to his death in 1816, he bequeathed his vast estates to his cousin George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke. Mount Merrion was occupied for a time by the Fitzwilliam agent Barbara Verschoyle and her husband, then Lord Herbert of Lea, and later by Sir Neville Wilkinson, from 1903 to 1914.\n\nOn first edition OSI Maps (early to mid 19th century) the townland is named 'Mount Merrion or Callary', and that name is still in evidenced by Callary Road which runs to the east of Foster Ave.\n\nDeer Park was landscaped by the 5th Viscount Fitzwilliam. The park lands comprise the area behind the site of Mount Merrion House. The park is now open to the public. It was created in 1971 from a collection of open public spaces and some acquisitions of private land. The park contains both sporting facilities (soccer and Gaelic football pitches and Deerpark Tennis Club) and landscaped land for more informal pursuits. Its location and altitude also provide it with a great view of Dublin city towards the north, which is often used by photographers for panoramas and also by developers to assess the impact of development on the cityscape. Crowds also gather in Deerpark to look out at the annual Skyfest fireworks display around St. Patricks Weekend which is sometimes held in Dublin city centre. It can also be a good vantage point for observing the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, when they are visible in the Dublin area. There is also a view of parts of the Dublin mountains to the south. It is claimed that Strongbow's white stallion is buried somewhere in Deer Park.\n\nThe estate at Mount Merrion started to be sold off to property developers Mount Merrion Estates around 1925, as this area of Dublin rapidly built up with suburban housing in mid-20th century. Mount Merrion House itself was sold to the Catholic church in 1936. The main house was converted for use as a Catholic church, and a new church, the Church of St. Therese, was built alongside in 1956. Much of the house was demolished in the late seventies. However, the front block of the house was retained and a new community centre was built onto the back of it. The plans for recent construction work on the community centre originally involved demolition of the house, however the plans were amended due to protests. The stables survive, beside the church. The original granite gateway were salvaged and now stands as the entrance to Willow Park School on the Rock Road (ironically Willow Park's own original gateway on Booterstown Avenue was later removed). Part of the estate eventually became the men-only Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club on Appian Way. These lands were part of the Fitzwilliam and later Pembroke Estates. Maps such as John Roque's (1760) and Barker's Estate Maps (1762) show much of what is now Deerpark as a formal walled garden and many of the prominent avenues and boundaries of the nearby Mount Merrion House lands form the basis of the present local road network.\n\nDeerpark now hosts sports such as football and tennis. The football pitches are used by Mount Merrion Youths Football Club and Kilmacud Crokes GAA club. The tennis club, established in 1976, is known as Deerpark Tennis Club.</ref>http://www.deerparkltc.com </ref> \n\nDeerpark Tennis Club is a community tennis club, founded in 1976. The club has six synthetic surface courts, all floodlit. Competitions are organised throughout the year.\n\nThe club participates in the Dublin Lawn Tennis Council (DLTC) Leagues in the greater Dublin area. These include Winter League, Summer League, Floodlit & Senior Leagues.\n\nDeerpark opened its new clubhouse in August 2010. The club's Junior Tennis Programme features coaching, social competitions and league participation.\n\nMount Merrion Youths Football Club is a community-based club. The club first represented Mount Merrion at the 1974 Community Games. In 2007 the club established its first representative all-girls team. All representatives of the club operate on a voluntary basis. The club proposes to build a flood lit all-weather pitch in the Deer Park.\n\nIn 2005, the club's under-18 representatives won the Leinster Football Association Youths' Cup.\n\nAlthough there is no club in Mount Merrion, many of the residents play for Kilmacud Crokes. Crokes play their juvenile matches in Deer Park. A local school, Scoil San Treasa, plays both Gaelic football and hurling.\n\nThe district is in the Dublin Rathdown electoral constituency, and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown (following the abolition, in 1994, of County Dublin as an administrative division of the state).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1888537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888537", "title": "Bernice King", "text": "Bernice King\n\nBernice Albertine King (born March 28, 1963) is an American minister and the youngest child of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. She was five years old when her father was assassinated. In her adolescence, King chose to work towards becoming a minister after having a breakdown from watching a documentary about her father. King was 17 when she was invited to speak at the United Nations. Twenty years after her father was assassinated, she preached her trial sermon. Inspired by her parents' activism, she was arrested multiple times during her early adulthood.\n\nHer mother suffered a stroke in 2005 and, after she died the following year, King delivered the eulogy at her funeral. A turning point in her life, King experienced conflict within her family when her sister Yolanda and brother Dexter supported the sale of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change. After her sister died in 2007, she delivered the eulogy for her as well. She supported the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008 and called his nomination part of her father's dream.\n\nKing was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 2009. Her elder brother Martin III and her father had previously held the position. She was the first woman elected to the presidency in the organization's history, amidst the SCLC holding two separate conventions. King became upset with the actions of the SCLC, amid feeling that the organization was ignoring her suggestions and declined the presidency in January 2010.\n\nKing became CEO of the King Center only months afterward. King's primary focus as CEO of The King Center and in life is to ensure that her father's nonviolent philosophy and methodology (which The King Center calls Nonviolence 365) is integrated in various sects of society, including education, government, business, media, arts and entertainment and sports. King believes that Nonviolence 365 is the answer to society's problems and promotes it being embraced as a way of life. King is also the CEO of First Kingdom Management, a Christian consulting firm based in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nBernice Albertine King was born on March 28, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia. The day after she was born, her father had to leave for Birmingham, Alabama, but he rushed back when it was time for Bernice and her mother, Coretta, to leave the hospital. He drove them home himself but, in what was all too typical with the work he was doing, had to leave them again within hours. Following her birth, Harry Belafonte realized the toll the Civil Rights Movement was taking on her mother's time and energy and offered to pay for a nurse to help Coretta with the Kings' four children. They accepted and hired a person that would help with the children for the next five or six years. Her father died a week after Bernice's fifth birthday.\n\nOnce, she and her sister Yolanda thought it would be funny to pour water into their father's ear while he was sleeping. Their father, though, was furious. It was the first and only time he would ever spank them.\n\nLater on, Coretta told Bernice that her father had celebrated her fifth birthday, knowledge that has been special to her since. King said she has only two strong memories of her father, one of him at home with their family and the other of him lying in the casket at his funeral. \"I don't let people know this, but I think of my father constantly,\" King said at age 19. \"Even though I knew him so little, he left me so much.\" When her father was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, Bernice was asleep. When she woke up, her mother told her that the next time she saw her father would be at his funeral. In the April 1998 issue of \"BET Entertainment Weekly\", King reflected, \"I was five when my father was assassinated, so I had no concept of who my father really was. I have been told, but imagine trying to really understand or put it in its proper perspective at that age. When it finally became clear to me around fifteen or sixteen, I was angry at him because he left me. So I didn't want to have anything to do with my father.\"\n\nAfter her husband's death, Coretta Scott King took on the role of raising four children as a single mother. Family friends recall that she spent considerable time with Bernice, who feels that being raised by a single parent has given her special insight into single-parent homes. “I didn’t have a father to deal with about boyfriends. I didn’t have a father to show me how a man and woman relate in a family setting. Therefore I have given over my life to mentoring young people. I’m adamant about young people who have been denied a father/daughter relationship.”\n\nOther tragedies followed. King's uncle, Alfred Daniel Williams King, drowned in a swimming pool when Bernice was six on July 21, 1969. Five years later, a mentally ill man shot her grandmother Alberta Williams King to death during a service at the Ebenezer Baptist Church on June 30, 1974. King recalled of her grandmother's death, \"I remember that day because I had recovered from having my tonsils removed, and I was really looking forward to getting back to Ebenezer, which was pastored by my grandfather on my dad's side of the family.\" Just two years later in 1976, her 20-year-old cousin Darlene King died of a heart attack. Her grandfather Martin Luther King Sr. also died of a heart attack on November 11, 1984. Also her other cousin Alfred King the second in 1986.\n\nFinding strength through these childhood tragedies, King jokingly said, required \"A lot of prayer. Some crying. Some screaming.\" Through all of her struggles, she has looked for someone to relate to in \"moments\" because \"nobody fits the bill.\" Her sister, Yolanda, nearly eight years older, lived through parts of the Civil Rights Movement that she never did. On the other hand, she has written that she believes her brothers have had a life significantly different from hers because \"Guys process things differently.\"\n\nBernice has said that the deaths of her grandmother and uncle caused her to have anger issues since she was 16 years old. At that age, she saw , a documentary film on her father's life from the time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 to his assassination in 1968, and \"went through almost two hours of crying\" and questioning. She had seen the film many times growing up, but the particular viewing \"triggered an emotional explosion that later would thrust her into the arms of a loving God.\" King reflected: \"When I saw the funeral scene, I just broke down. I ran out of the cabin into the woods, and for nearly 2-1/2 hours, I just cried.\" She credited the viewing with influencing her to become a minister like her father, who served as a minister at Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n\nShe was with her church youth group in Georgia mountains. King aspired to become the first female President of the United States at the time of seeing the documentary. Timothy McDonald brought the tape of the documentary and comforted her when she started crying. According to McDonald, he explained to her that it was good that she let out how she felt and called coming to terms with her father's death \"a stepping stone upon which you will build the rest of your life”.\nKing attended Douglass High School in Atlanta. Her brother Dexter Scott King attended the school as well and graduated when she was a sophomore. At 17, she was invited to speak at the United Nations in the absence of her mother. According to King, she also received a call to ministry that year.\n\nAt the age of 19, she made her first major speech in Chicago, and stated that \"We've come a long way. But we have a long way to go.\" In early 1983, King gave a speech at St. Sabina Church in Chicago. Many members of the audience said that she reminded them of her father. King attended Grinnell College in Iowa, and graduated from Spelman College, a historically black college in Atlanta, with a degree in psychology. King says she had thoughts of suicide before \"God intervened.\"\n\nKing was arrested with her mother Coretta and her brother Martin Luther King III on June 26, 1985 with the offense of demonstrating in front of an embassy. They were participating in anti-apartheid demonstration in front of the South African Embassy. The three stayed in jail overnight. The youngest daughter of Martin Luther King, his widow and his eldest son were charged with a misdemeanor, demonstrating within 500 feet of an embassy.\nOn January 7, 1986, King was arrested with her sister Yolanda and her brother Martin Luther King III for \"disorderly conduct.\" Bernice and her siblings were arrested by officers deployed to the Winn Dixie supermarket. The supermarket had been subject to protest since September 1985, which was when the Southern Christian Leadership Conference began boycotts of South African canned fruit. It was the first time Bernice and her siblings had been arrested together at a protest. On January 15, 1987, what would have been her father's 58th birthday, King spoke in Chicago and told denizens to stay away from drugs.\n\nOn May 14, 1990, King became the second woman to be ordained at Ebenezer Baptist Church. She said that it was \"the most humbling moment for me in my life.\" King insisted that she was \"not worthy of this high calling. No blood, no sweat, no tears could earn me this high calling.\"\nOn January 18, 1992, President George H. W. Bush visited the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. King spoke during his visit of the problems of racism, poverty and violence remained in America since her father was alive, but did not directly align any of the issues with President Bush.\n\nIn January 1994, King voiced her opposition to New Hampshire's refusal to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, calling the decision \"racist and separatist.\" On May 21, 1994, she attended the African-American Women's Conference where she said that parents should not let their children listen to \"gangster rap\" because of messages in the lyrics.\nIn 1996, King published a collection of her sermons and speeches called \"Hard Questions, Heart Answers\". In 2000, she narrated a performance of Aaron Copland's \"Lincoln Portrait\" at the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. In January of that year, King joined Fred Shuttlesworth in headlining a two-week campus celebration of her father's life at Stanford University.\n\nKing said her mother heard Obama's speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and contacted her the following day over the senator's address, expressing her belief in Obama's political future. In June 2006, King told a teenage audience that she intended to do more to carry on the legacy of nonviolence espoused by her parents during the 20th annual 100 Black Men of America conference in Atlanta. \"My desire is not to be a hypocrite,\" King said. \"I want to make sure my life is not a contradiction when I take a platform.\"\nOn January 30, 2007, one year after the death of her mother Coretta, King founded the Be A King Scholarship at Spelman College, her alma mater, in honor of her mother's legacy. On June 10, 2007, King acted as a presenter at the 2007 Atlanta H.U.F. Awards. Afeni Shakur said she was happy to have King and the other presenters \"participating\" that year.\n\nShe was an elder at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, but resigned in May 2011. King joined the church in 2002 and came to regard Bishop Eddie Long as her mentor and spiritual father. The church was the setting for her mother's funeral. Despite her leaving of the church coinciding with Bishop Eddie Long's settlement agreement in sexual misconduct lawsuits he had fought since September 2010, King said that she had planned to leave New Birth Missionary Baptist Church for weeks. \"It has nothing to do with anything that's going on with Bishop Long,\" King said on May 25, 2011. \"I always knew I would not be at New Birth forever. This is the time for me to leave.\" On May 25, 2011, King told an interviewer that her last time serving as a member of the church was the past Sunday. She has said her decision to leave was because of her desire to continue the legacy of her parents, which had grown stronger since the death of her mother. At the time that she chose to leave the church, she planned on starting her own ministry.\n\nKing donated $100,000 of her personal funds, while $75,000 was donated from Home Depot and $15,000 from New Birth Missionary Baptist Church. The scholarship will be awarded to two rising seniors at Spelman College who are majoring in music, education or psychology. On May 4, 2013, a rose was planted for King's mother, Coretta, at the Alabama Capitol. Bernice said that while her mother loved roses, she did not have much time to tend to them because she was continuing her husband Martin Luther King, Jr.'s legacy.\n\nOn April 29, 2014, King and her brother Martin Luther King III joined Governor of Georgia Nathan Deal while he signed legislation to provide a statue of their father. “We all know that monuments and statues are that, they’re things we put in place for people to remember and it's not always for our generation,” Bernice King said. “It’s really about the next generation.” On May 31, 2014, King accepted a $50,000 grant from Microsoft during the opening of its store at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta. Also in attendance to the ceremony were Mary Carol Alexander, Georgia Department of Labor Commissioner Mark Butler and Representative Tom Taylor. On June 24, 2014, King's parents were posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Bernice King stated in a statement released after the award was announced that the King family was \"deeply honored\" by her parents \"being given this award in recognition of their tireless and sacrificial leadership to advance freedom and justice through nonviolence in our nation\". King was the keynote speaker at the Atlantic City Rescue Mission 50th anniversary gala, held on August 14, 2014.\n\nAt the age of 24, Bernice decided to become a minister, and she earned a Master's degree in Divinity and a juris doctor from Emory University. King is also a member of the State Bar of Georgia. During her college years, King considered a career as a television anchor. In May 1988, King was among the students of Emory charging that the college should hire more African-Americans as teachers and teach the works of African-American theologians in its courses. She said, \"Black students on predominately White campuses have been ignored, humiliated, intimidated...and in many instances, eliminated.\" She said the students and people in general had excused the \"insensitivity\" of the administration and faculty \"for too long.\" Bernice served as a student chaplain at the Georgia Retardation Center and Georgia Baptist Hospital as part of the requirements for her theology class and interned at the Atlanta City Attorney's office. She is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, as was her mother.\n\nOn March 27, 1988, nearly 20 years after her father's assassination, King delivered her first sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church. The sermon's theme was \"You've Got To Rise Above The Crowd.\" King said her decision to deliver the sermon as \"affirming a call I received at 17.\" She also said, \"At some point in our lives, comes the moment of decision. For me, that moment is now. I submit myself totally to the will of God.\" Andrew Young, who attended the sermon, compared her style to her father's and noted their similarities while calling listening to her speak \"a very emotional occasion for me.\"\n\nYoung also said that King becoming a minister \"almost makes you believe preaching is hereditary,\" after her service. By delivering an \"acceptable sermon,\" King was given her license to preach by Joseph Roberts, pastor of Ebenezer who stated, \"We rejoice with God, the angels and the archangels that another warrior, a peaceful warrior, is fighting under the spirit of her father, grandfather and uncle.\" Veteran members of the church said her style was similar to her father's.\n\nKing's mother said at the time that she was satisfied with her daughter's decision to become a minister and stated that they had become closer than ever in the months leading up to the sermon. She also said listening to her daughter delivering a sermon with the same fervor and intensity her father had \"was a joyous occasion; a real thanksgiving.\" Also in attendance where all three of her elder siblings, Yolanda, Martin Luther King III and Dexter. King's maternal grandparents were reported by her mother to have also been moved by the speech. Her sermon was delivered the day before her twenty-fifth birthday.\n\nIn 2008, King and her brother, Martin Luther King III, filed suit over the alleged mismanagement of funds from the King Center against their brother Dexter Scott King, who then filed a countersuit against them. Dexter King articulated his distress over Bernice's conservative religious views as departing from their father's legacy. In October 2009 the lawsuits were settled out of court.\n\nIn January 2012, King was named CEO of the King Center. On May 19, 2012, King met with Aïssata Issoufou Mahamadou, First Lady of Niger and wife of Mahamadou Issoufou. Mahamadou's visit to the King Center was a priority during her trip to the United States, having been an ardent admirer of King's father and mother. King accepted a plaque bearing crucifix symbols from Mahamadou.\n\nOn September 26, 2013, Evelyn G. Lowery died at her home. The King Center released a statement from Bernice King in response to her death, with her saying \"I am deeply saddened by the death of Mrs. Evelyn Gibson Lowery, and my heart goes out to her husband, Dr. Joseph E. Lowery and their three daughters, Yvonne Kennedy, Karen Lowery and Cheryl Lowery-Osborne. We are never prepared to say 'goodbye' to a loved one.\"\nWhen Vice President Joe Biden aligned with her in celebrating a \"naturalization ceremony\" for an estimated hundred immigrants on November 16, 2013, she displayed distaste for the terms \"illegal aliens\" and \"illegals\".\n\nOn March 28, 2014, in honor of King's 51st birthday, the King Center hosted a girl and women's empowerment event. The organization held a special screening of the documentary \"Girls Rising.\" King herself said the experience was \"designed to educate, empower and inspire young women to confront and overcome the obstacles they face in their struggles to fulfill their dreams and impact the global community.”\n\nOn August 13, 2014, King addressed the shooting death of Michael Brown and demonstrators reacting in response. She called on demonstrators to channel their responses into constructive nonviolent action, and mentioned witnesses giving conflicting accounts of the shooting. On August 19, King expressed her belief that the community of Ferguson, Missouri was crying out for help after years of neglect. It was reported that a small delegation from the King Center would travel to Ferguson and planned to meet with \"every element\" of the community.\nThe following day, August 20, King released a statement on Michael Brown's death, sympathizing with his parents. On August 26, King addressed students at the Riverview Gardens High School. King told the students her father's legacy was \"on the line\" and if “this doesn’t turn out the right way, it could begin to have people question what happened years ago.”\n\nKing was the keynote speaker at the Seminole County Prayer Breakfast in February 1998. Geoff Koach, spokesman for Strang Communications, said prior to the breakfast that there was an expectation to see \"a lot more people of color there\" and another reason for her being chosen to speak was to quell racial tensions in the county. He added: \"We felt she could help unify citizens, the various organizations, government and church officials.\"\nIn June 2006, five months after her mother's death, King made it known to a number of teenagers during the panel discussion at the 20th annual 100 Black Men of America conference in Atlanta that she intended to continue the legacy of nonviolence that had been attributed to her parents. That same year, King and her brother Martin Luther King III expressed interest in creating a civil rights museum near Ebenezer Baptist Church and the King Center, where both of their parents are buried.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, she joined her brother Martin Luther King III on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" to discuss the inauguration of the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama.\n\nOn April 17, 2009, King delivered an address at Liberty University. LU Chancellor Jerry Falwell, Jr. said that the university had been looking forward to King speaking all year. He said King helped \"to bridge the divide that was created between different groups of students during the 2008 election season. For example, she gave a strong Gospel message today. African American Christians and white Christians have been separated into different political camps in the last generation or so but they share many of the same core values, especially when it comes to social issues like abortion, marriage and school vouchers.\" King said the university was a place for \"kings-in-training.\" She told Liberty University students they were \"very blessed and highly favored to be at an institution such as this.\" She called for students to accept “your identity. You’re a king. Don’t ever see yourself as a subject.\"\n\nOn July 7, 2009, King spoke alongside her brother Martin at the Staples Center in Los Angeles at a ceremony commemorating the life of Michael Jackson.\n\nOn October 16, 2011, King mentioned at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial opening that the memorial had been in the making for a lengthy amount of time and a \"priority\" for her mother. She and her brother Martin supported Occupy Wall Street protests. On January 13, 2012, King was the keynote speaker at the 24th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Awards Dinner. On March 29, 2012, a month after the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, King released a statement through the King Center. In her remarks, she referred back to the deaths of her father and paternal grandmother, who like Trayvon Martin, were killed by firearms. She concluded her statement by saying we \"are still on the journey to the Mountaintop. Join me on the journey as we pray for Trayvon's family, the community of Sanford and all who are in danger of being victims of violence.\"\n\nShe made a public statement with regard to the State of Florida v. George Zimmerman verdict on July 15, 2013 via a CNN appearance with Wolf Blitzer. She clarified a tweet she had posted on Twitter, and explained that the handling of the verdict would \"determine how much progress we've made\". She spoke at a town hall meeting dedicated to Trayvon Martin and has admitted to having been \"heartbroken\" by the verdict. She said Trayvon Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal were a wake-up call for Americans.\n\nOn August 28, 2013, the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, in which her father took part, King spoke and related that the denizens of the United States were \"still bound by a cycle of civil unrest and inherit social biases, in our nation and the world, that oftentimes degenerates into violence and destruction\". Despite this, she admitted to being pleased to see many young people and women at the event, noting that was not the case during the March on Washington itself. King alluded to the death of teenager Trayvon Martin in February 2012 and said \"If freedom stops ringing, then the sound will disappear and the atmosphere will be charged with something else. Fifty years later, we come once again to this special landing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to reflect, to renew and to rejuvenate for the continued struggle of freedom and justice.\"\n\nShe spoke at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Florida fundraiser on October 29, 2013, where she encouraged involvement in the lives of children. King addressed the death of Nelson Mandela on December 5, 2013. On January 20, 2014, the year's Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, King spoke at Ebenezer Baptist Church. King said there was \"much work that we must do\" and asked if we are \"afraid, or are we truly committed to the work that must be done?\"\nOn March 19, 2014, King gave a speech at Seminole State College of Florida as part of the school's Speaker Series. It focused on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After her address, King was presented with a key to the city by Sanford Vice Mayor Velma Williams. King spoke at Fontbonne University on September 17, 2014. She was joined by members of the King Center staff, who aided her in urging the community to not act out with violence.\n\nOn December 11, 2004, King participated in a march against same-sex marriage in Atlanta. This action was in contrast to the advocacy of her mother, Coretta, and her older sister Yolanda, both longtime, outspoken supporters of gay rights. She was joined by senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Eddie Long, who said in a written statement that the march was not \"to protest same-sex marriage, but to present a unified version of righteousness and justice.\" At the time of the march, King said she had become a \"spiritual daughter\" of Eddie Long and the issue of same-sex marriage legalization had left many divided. \"The question is, how do you overcome that pain?\" she said. \"It may be the wedge that stays with us for a long time. We have to get to a place where it does not become the most defining issue of our time.\"\n\nShe incorporated the King Center and the eternal flame at her father's tomb into the march. The King Center denied her permission to begin the march at her father's tomb and accused her of doing so to \"provide support for her own personal cause\" and \"to enhance her personal standing in New Birth.\" The event was also criticized by gay rights organizations, which stated it betrayed the legacy of her father. Chuck Bowen, a spokesman for Georgia Equality, stated that he was surprised to learn of the march. \"I think it's very sad,\" Bowen said. \"I think she's abusing the good name of Dr. King and the work he did creating equality for all Americans.\"\n\nKing's mother, Coretta Scott King, had a stroke in August 2005. She died on January 30, 2006. King delivered the eulogy at her funeral. King called her mother's death a \"major turning point.\" She felt that her mother's death was a \"rebirth\" for her, \"in terms of understanding that I come from roots of greatness and I am called to greatness and there's nothing I can do but try to be my best self.\" On October 24, 2005, Rosa Parks died of natural causes. Her funeral took place on November 2, 2005. Bernice King attended the funeral and delivered remarks on behalf of her mother. Bernice was the only one of the four King children to be with Coretta Scott King when she died and learned that her mother's remains could not be transported back to Georgia, since Mexican authorities required an autopsy first.\n\nIn the months between her stroke and death, Bernice and her brother Martin Luther King III vowed to fight the sale of the King Center to the National Park Service. The siblings were put against their brother Dexter and sister Yolanda, who supported and voted in favor of the sale in early December 2005. On December 30, 2005, King and her brother Martin stated that their priority was to preserve their \"father's legacy and their mother's dream.\" Bernice stated of her mother's opinion on the sale that \"She felt at some point that it may, in fact, end up with the government, but she never envisioned that in her lifetime.\" Andrew Young said transferring power would allow the family to focus more on Martin Luther King's message of nonviolence and less on maintaining the grounds. Bernice King said government ownership, which would befall the King Center if it were sold to the National Park Service, would result in \"a loss of ideological independence.\" Martin Luther King III stated that Bernice had been removed as secretary and that he had been replaced as chairman by their brother Dexter.\n\n16 months later, on May 15, 2007, King's sister Yolanda King died after collapsing and was unable to be revived. King delivered the eulogy at her sister's memorial on May 24, 2007. During Yolanda King's eulogy, King admitted that her death was even more difficult than her mother's and said her sister often addressed her as her \"one and only sister.\" She added, \"It's very difficult standing here blessed as her one and only sister. Yolanda, from your one and only, I thank you for being a sister and for being a friend.\" She joined her brothers in lighting candles in their sister's memory.\n\nWith her brother Martin Luther King III, she has played an active part in reforming the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) once led by her father. When she was elected President and CEO of SCLC on October 30, 2009, a position previously held by both her father and brother, she became the first woman to lead the group, but discord in the organization has prevented her taking that position. King's election was won by a 23-to-15 vote, allowing her to defeat Arkansas judge, Wendell Griffen. Specialists said King would need to move beyond her family history when she took the position the following year. Andra Gillespie, a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said King could hark back to her father's legacy, but that she was going to have to \"redefine\" it. Gillespie also stated that King would have to \"figure out a way to push that legacy forward so we don't perpetuate a stagnant, chauvinistic civil rights agenda.\"\n\nDespite her excitement being \"high\", King noticed the SCLC's board of directors had started \"ignoring\" suggestions she made to \"revitalize\" the organization. King said that she had made suggestions to the SCLC about how the presidency might operate in October 2010, but was not contacted formally until January, three months later. She stated that she felt \"disrespect\" by the three months in between her suggestions to the organization and their response. Despite this, she said that she would continue to \"pray for them to move in a positive direction\". On October 1, 2010, she led a prayer to an audience of around 200 people that had come to pray for healing and reconciliation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Through prayer, King said, they would \"seek to destroy the work of the enemy.\" King called the SCLC preparing to hold two separate conventions \"an unfortunate turn of events.\" In January 2011, three months after making the plea, she declined to be SCLC's president. While in Birmingham, Alabama on August 11, 2014 for the national convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King endorsed having the 2016 Democratic National Convention be held in Birmingham, reasoning the \"golden anniversary of civil rights events throughout the south and Birmingham in particular offers added significance\" to it being held there.\n\nKing and her brother Martin Luther King III accused their brother Dexter of having disengaged them from decisions and shareholder meetings. They alleged that their brother had done this since 2004. On October 12, 2009, the dispute was settled out of court. The King siblings spent the entire day of October 12 locked away. The purpose of the lockdown was for the three to settle on a deal. Following the completing of their meeting, Bernice and her brother Martin said outside the Fulton County Courthouse that the results of the settlement seemed positive.\n\nBernice King and Martin also opposed the giving up of photographs, personal letters and papers of their mother to a biographer. Their brother Dexter asked a judge to force them to comply. The biographer, Ms. Reynolds, met Coretta Scott King in 1972 and said that the widow had asked for her to write a follow up to her 1969 memoir. King and her brother's lawyer stated that their mother had changed her mind about the biography citing Mrs. King's apparent disapproval of Reynolds's writing style. A judge ordered the Kings to appear in court on October 14, 2008. David J. Garrow, biographer of King's father, said that it was \"sad and pathetic to see the three of them behaving in this self-destructive way.”\n\nBy September 2009, the book deal was defunct and a judge ordered the three siblings to have a meeting. On September 14, King and her brother Martin sat through court motions, testimony and proceedings for more than 13 hours. In a separate hearing, Dexter Scott King's attorney Lin Wood argued that Bernice King willingly ignored a court order. He reasoned this because Bernice did not reveal the contents of the safe deposit box.\n\nWood also said King's brother Martin and one of Bernice's lawyers, who was no longer on the case, was aware of the letters and refused to reveal them. Bernice's attorney Charles Mathis said she \"did not conceal anything\" and said \"She thought she was doing what she was supposed to do when she told her first lawyer. There was not an intentional failure to disclose.\"\n\nThe next day, Dexter Scott King's lawyers contended that Bernice was legally compelled to turn the letters over to Dexter, but ignored the order. Dexter's attorney Wood said \"Regardless of what your last name is, if you have willfully withheld then you must suffer the consequences.\" Wood noted that Bernice denied the existence of the safety deposit box several times while under oath, which she said she found after the death of her sister Yolanda, who once owned it.\n\nOn August 28, 2013, the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, the King estate filed a lawsuit against the King Center alleging that it had been careless with its handling of Martin Luther King, Jr. memorabilia. The lawsuit also claimed that attempts to resolve the issue with King Center CEO Bernice King have failed and that there had been a \"total breakdown in communication and transparency.\" The King estate sent a 30-day notice to the Center on August 10, 2013. It notified the center that the licensing agreement for the King memorabilia was being terminated and that the center could avoid this by placing Bernice King on administrative leave and pulling Andrew Young and Alveda King from the board. According to the estate, Alveda King tried to \"impede\" the audit.\nThe estate sought a court order barring the center from using the memorabilia after the license expired.\n\nBernice King announced in a statement on January 22, 2015 that the estate of her father, run by her brothers, had voluntarily dropped the lawsuit. She said the King Center's positions on its legal rights were vindicated by the estate's dropping of the lawsuit and that the action was a sign that the siblings' feud was on the road to reconciliation.\n\nHarry Belafonte filed a lawsuit in October 2013, where he asked to be declared the owner of three documents given to him by the Kings and for their daughter Bernice King to be barred permanently from trying to claim ownership. The documents are Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"Casualties of the War in Vietnam\", which Belafonte stated he had been in possession of since 1967, the undelivered \"Memphis Speech\" found in Martin Luther King's pocket after his assassination and a letter of condolence sent by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the then-newly widowed Coretta Scott King. The King estate and Bernice King disputed Belafonte's ownership of the documents when in 2008, he took the items to Sotheby's auction house in New York to be appraised and put up for sale. On April 11, 2014, Belafonte and the King estate said in a joint statement that a confidential compromise \"resulted in Mr. Belafonte retaining possession of the documents.\"\n\nKing's brothers Martin Luther King III and Dexter Scott King are interested in selling their father's Nobel Peace Prize and his Bible, which was later used by Barack Obama during his second presidential inauguration in 2013. Her brothers filed a lawsuit against her, complaining that she had \"secreted and sequestered\" the two items of interest in violation of a 1995 agreement that gives the brothers sole control of all of their father's property. King said in her defense, \"I take this strong position for my father because Daddy is not here to say himself my Bible and medals are never to be sold.\"\n\nMartin Luther King III was reported to have sent her, on January 20, 2014, the year's Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a letter requesting a meeting to \"discuss and vote on whether to offer for purchase at a private sale the Nobel Peace Prize and the King Bible.” On January 22, 2014, Dexter Scott and Martin Luther King III voted as board members of the King estate to pursue the sale of their father's award and Bible. The items had been in Bernice's care since the death of their mother, Coretta Scott King, in 2006. Bernice's position had support by members of the civil rights community, including C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, and Joseph Lowery. King's cousin, Alveda King, was also supportive of Bernice. She said, \"I am standing with her because I do believe we can't have a sale to the highest bidder with those family heirlooms.\"\n\nOn February 4, 2014, Bernice King stated that she would protest the sale of her father's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize and as a result, oppose her brothers. She said profiting from the Nobel Peace Prize's sale would be \"spiritually violent\" and \"outright morally reprehensible.\" On February 6, 2014, King asked in a press conference in Ebenezer Baptist Church for the media to “refrain from grouping me with my brothers.” On February 19, 2014, a judge ordered her to give up the items, and had them kept temporarily in a safe deposit box under the name of the King estate. The judge will remain in possession of the key until the matter is settled.\n\nThe judge compared King's stance against the sale of her father's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize to Coca-Cola not wanting to sell its recipe, and later noted that he was not trying to trivialize the value of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s possessions by making the comparison. While King said that people had urged her to retain the Bible and Nobel Peace Prize and go to prison instead, she complied with the judge's order. On March 6, 2014, she asked her brothers to hold another vote and said she hoped one of them would change his mind. Despite facing an estrangement from her brothers, she hoped that she would be able to reconcile with them on the matter and said she is open to an out-of-court settlement. She appealed to anyone who would consider purchasing the bible and Nobel Peace Prize should they be put on sale to take the moral high road by leaving the \"sacred in its sacred state.\" While she was given a deadline of turning them over by March 3, it was extended another five days, according to one of Bernice's lawyers.\n\nKing said that she would never support her brothers in selling the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible. She said that if her father was alive, he would say, \"my Bible and my medal are never to be sold, not to an institution or even a person.” On March 10, 2014, King turned over the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible to Martin Luther King III for placement in a safety deposit box in a meeting that lasted five minutes. A lawyer involved in the dispute said few words were exchanged while Bernice surrendered the items. Eric Barnum, an attorney of Bernice King, said that his client \"complied with the court order.\"\n\nOn March 14, 2014, Ron Gaither, one of Bernice King's lawyers, argued that William Hill, lawyer of Martin Luther King III and Dexter King, should not have any role in the case because of his involvement in the 2008 dispute between the King children. A judge appointed Hill as Special Master in 2008. Lawyers of Bernice King in a court hearing said that \"Hill played a vital and substantial role in adjudicating a multitude of disputes that arose between the parties.\" The lawyers argued that this gave Hill an advantage while putting Bernice at a disadvantage. Hill's defense of himself was that he only had access to documents related to Coretta Scott King's estate and that Bernice King's lawyers were using a stalling tactic by trying to disqualify him. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney stated that he would soon issue a ruling on whether Hill would be disqualified.\n\nMcBurney granted Bernice King's lawyers request and disqualified Hill. A full hearing is scheduled to take place in late September.\n\nOn December 14, 2007, at the State Bar of Georgia Headquarters, King was honored by the Georgia Alliance of African American Attorneys with the \"Commitment to Community\" award for her work as an attorney and community leader.\n\nOn October 7, 2009, King received an award for her \"lifetime of service to women and other causes\" at the National Coalition of 100 Black Women Convention.\n\nOn November 7, 2013, as part of the \"Celebrating the Dream”, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the I Have a Dream speech done by her father, King received the Legend Award as a tribute to his legacy and after she delivered a speech.\n\n\"Ebony\" magazine named her one of their \"Ten of Tomorrow\" future leaders of the black community.\n\nIn 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. She once said to LGBT supporters that her father did not take a bullet for same-sex marriage.\n\nDuring Atlanta's 2012 Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally, King included LGBT people among the various groups who needed to come together to \"fulfill her father’s legacy.\" When speaking at Brown University in 2013, King made statements regarding her beliefs about the origins of marriage: \"I believe that the family was created and ordained first and foremost by God, that he instituted the marriage, and that's a law that he instituted and not... that we instituted\" and about the origins of same-sex attraction: \"I also don't believe everybody's born that way. I know some people have been violated. I know some people have unfortunately delved into it as an experiment\". King has publicly stated that her father would have been against gay marriage.\n\nHowever, by 2015, it appeared she had changed, as she issued a press release as CEO of the King Center supporting the Supreme Court's Same-Sex Marriage ruling.\n\nKing is opposed to abortion. She believes that life begins and should be protected by law at conception. On August 22, 2013, King expressed her belief that \"life begins in a woman’s womb.”\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1888545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888545", "title": "WNYL (FM)", "text": "WNYL (FM)\n\nWNYL is an FM radio station licensed to New York City and owned by Entercom. WNYL broadcasts an Alternative rock format branded as \"Alt 92.3\", with studios located in the Hudson Square neighborhood in Manhattan and transmitter located at the Empire State Building.\n\nThe station was the flagship of \"The Howard Stern Show\" from November 1985 to December 2005, and \"The Opie and Anthony Show\" from April 2006 until March 2009.\n\nWNYL also broadcasts in HD Radio.\n\nThe station, first went on the air on December 25, 1948 as WMCA-FM. The station was co-owned with WMCA (570 AM) by former New York state senator Nathan Straus Jr.. FM radio was not a successful venture for Straus, and he decided to either sell the FM station or close it down altogether.\n\nIn late 1950, Straus sold the station to the owners of WHOM radio (1480 AM) and WHOM-FM went on the air on February 26, 1951, featuring a variety of formats, including ethnic, background music, classical, Spanish, and easy listening. By the early 1970s, WHOM-FM had a Spanish-language easy listening format.\n\nWHOM and WHOM-FM, in the early 1970s, were sold to SJR Communications. On June 5, 1975, WHOM-FM became WKTU, taking on an Adult Contemporary format and was positioned as \"soft rock\". They were known as \"Mellow 92\". They played current AC songs that crossed over to Top 40 as well as a mix of music from 1964 forward. Core artists included Eagles, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, James Taylor, Paul Simon, Stylistics, Linda Ronstadt, Four Tops, Carly Simon, Barry Manilow, and some more contemporary cuts by Barbra Streisand. For 1960s music the station played softer Beatles songs, Mamas and Papas, Spanky and Our Gang, Association, Fifth Dimension, among others. The station steered clear of AC only songs and standards vocalists as well as hard rock or uptempo R & B. Eventually the station evolved, re-positioned as mellow rock, dropped artists like the Carpenters, most R & B product, and added some softer songs from AOR artists. Unlike today's Adult contemporary music formats, WKTU, by early 1978, was only playing artists heard on Album-oriented rock stations, using the softer songs from their popular albums. Artists found primarily on Top 40 stations were no longer included. WKTU was still called \"Mellow 92\" at that point. Ratings were relatively low. The \"Mellow 92\" format continued until June 1978.\n\nMeanwhile, station executive David Rapaport (father of actor Michael Rapaport) visited New York's Studio 54 discothèque on half a dozen occasions, and was very impressed with the crowds there. He got the idea that a disco-based station was needed, as several FM-based Top 40 stations were leaning disco in other markets, although no one was airing all disco music around the clock. As a result, Rapaport purchased 200 disco records and brought them into the station. WKTU abruptly flipped to a disco-based rhythmic top 40 format with the tagline \"Disco 92\" at 6 p.m. on July 24, 1978. The same disc jockeys from the mellow format were at first kept on, with Paco from Spanish language sister station 1480 WJIT added for afternoons. That fall, the station rose from \"Worst to First\", unseating long-time leader 770 WABC in the 18−30 age demographic. Air personalities of this era included Kenn Hayes, Randy Place, Paul Robinson, Trip Reeb, Mary Thomas, Dave Mallow and Joe Guarisco. During the height of the disco craze, WKTU was \"the\" station to follow in New York.\n\nInitially, WKTU played mostly dance/disco and a few rhythm-friendly pop and rock songs (such as \"Miss You\" by the Rolling Stones for example), but by 1979, the station began to add more R&B music (though they played some at the launch in 78 as well) as well as rhythm friendly new wave rock. By then, WKTU was still regarded as a disco station, but could be more accurately described as rhythmic contemporary hit radio. Since that term was not yet used, the station had been classified as urban contemporary. During this period, the disc jockeys included Paco, G. Keith Alexander, Rosko, J.D. Holiday (Paul Zarcone), Dale Reeves, Bob Bottone, Jim Harlan, Carlos DeJesus, Joe Causi, Guy Broady, Jay Thomas, Freddie Colon, Don Geronimo, Al Bandiero and Diane Pryor. Paco later went to jail for drug dealing. \n\nIn 1981, SJR Communications sold WKTU to Infinity Broadcasting (which merged with CBS Radio in 1997). Also that year, WKTU added more dance-based new wave to the format. WKTU remained among the top ten New York City radio stations through 1983. Shortly thereafter, WKTU received new competition from WHTZ and WPLJ, both of which adapted a CHR format. The station maintained respectable but declining ratings, due to the new competition.\n\nBy mid-1984, WKTU moved to a mainstream CHR format as well, giving up its disco past, but the ratings continued to decline. That fall, the station added legendary WABC host Dan Ingram to afternoons, and Jo Maeder, \"The Madame\", from Miami's Y-100, joined Jay Thomas in the morning and did her own midday show, but the station continued to struggle in the ratings. To make matters worse, then-named 103.5 WAPP also went CHR that fall.\n\nSo strong was the memory of the late-1970s WKTU that despite all the subsequent on-air changes, the general public still regarded it as a disco station. Even though WAPP moved back to playing mostly rock music in the form of a rock-based CHR in June 1985, giving WKTU one less competitor, the station management thought a more drastic change was needed. Since New York City only had one full-time rock station with WNEW-FM, there was an opportunity.\n\nOn July 13, 1985, at midnight, on the same day WKTU aired the historic Live Aid concert, the station switched to an album-oriented rock format, adopted the moniker \"K-Rock\", and changed their call letters to WXRK. (The WKTU call letters later reappeared on New York City's 103.5 FM with a dance pop format in 1996).\n\nInitially, the format at WXRK was similar to the pre-1983 WPLJ, as the air personalities left the station gradually in the next several months (exceptions were Maria Malito and Jo Maeder, who became known as \"The Rock and Roll Madame\"). Jimmy Fink from WPLJ was one of the first new radio personalities to be hired. After being fired from WNBC in October 1985, Howard Stern signed on to do afternoons, and initially combined music with talk, but on February 18, 1986, Stern took over the morning slot. His morning show became the highest-rated in the market, dethroning Don Imus, who previously had the highest-rated morning show for several years on 660 WNBC. Later that year Stern's show became syndicated, with WXRK as its flagship station.\n\nBy 1987, Stern stopped playing music on his show altogether, while the station changed to a classic rock format on June 5 of that same year. The airstaff, which included Flo & Eddie from classic rock band The Turtles, became full of veterans from other New York rock stations, including Dave Herman, Pete Fornatale, Meg Griffin, Vin Scelsa, and Alison Steele from WNEW-FM, along with Jimmy Fink, Tony Pigg, Marc Coppola, and John Zacherle from WPLJ. In 1993, The Greaseman's syndicated show was put in the nighttime slot, bookending Stern with an act that was often quite controversial.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, modern rock had become popular. In mid-1993, in New York City radio, WHTZ began to play a lot of modern rock despite primarily being a CHR station. Late in 1993, Classical music station WNCN switched formats and became WAXQ (\"Q 104.3\"), with a mix of hard and modern rock. Moreover, WNEW-FM switched to a modern rock format in the summer of 1995, and later evolved to first an adult-based modern rock format by the end of that year, and then to a more eclectic adult rock mix by 1996. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1996, there was no full-time modern rock station in New York City.\n\nTo fill the void, WXRK switched to an alternative leaning active rock format on January 5, 1996, right after Stern's show. To kick off the new format, which he enthusiastically endorsed as a better fit for his audience, Stern stayed on the air until 1:06 p.m. that day playing music. The first song Stern played was Marilyn Manson's cover of \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\". Most of the classic rock DJs, including Jimmy Fink, Tony Pigg and Marc Coppola, disappeared from the station with this change, as did The Greaseman. By August 1997, the station added more music that suited an active rock station and removed pop leaning alternative product (which they played very little of anyway), and it continued this format of a hybrid active rock/alternative for several years.\n\nBy 2003, with a new program director, the station dropped the active rock variant of music. No matter what the format, the longtime problem for the station was that while Stern always had very high ratings, the rest of the station did not fare as well. Moreover, it was hard to classify K-Rock an alternative station (considering classic rock acts like Led Zeppelin were being played), while it was hard to label it as active rock due to the inclusion of some, but not all, alternative artists.\n\nConcerned about Stern's move to Sirius Satellite Radio at the beginning of 2006, and acknowledging that its target audience was looking elsewhere for modern rock music, WXRK made another format adjustment on April 4, 2005 to a mainstream rock format, which relied heavily on classic rock from artists such as Guns N' Roses, Metallica, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Nirvana, while playing new music from such established artists as System of a Down, Nine Inch Nails, Green Day and Weezer. At this time, New York City was one of the few large cities in the United States without an alternative rock station. To prevent any backlash from fans of modern rock, an Internet-only radio station called \"K-Rock2\" was launched at the same time as the format adjustment. The strategy did not work, as ratings did not improve much.\n\nAs a result of the imminent departure of Howard Stern to Sirius Satellite Radio, an announcement was made on October 25, 2005 that the station would adopt a Hot talk format on January 3, 2006.\n\nAt 10 a.m. on Friday, December 16, after the last terrestrial Howard Stern show, K-Rock began a 20-minute stunt with a melange of audio sound bites, music and program line-up announcements. At 10:20, K-Rock DJ Julie Slater announced \"Welcome to Free FM\", and went into music.\n\nThe WXRK call letters were replaced by WFNY-FM (standing for \"Free New York\") on January 1, 2006, with the official \"Free FM\" launch two days later at 6 a.m. The station, which was one of several CBS Radio stations around the nation branded as \"Free FM\", featured rock singer David Lee Roth as its morning show host. Other talk shows from hosts such as The Dog House with JV & Elvis, Penn Jillette, Leslie Gold, Chris Booker, and Jake Fogelnest & Jackie Clarke aired weekdays, while an active rock music format continued to be played on the weekends, called \"Free Rock Weekends.\n\nSimultaneously, the WXRK call sign moved to the former in Cleveland, also owned by CBS Radio, and coincidentally at the same 92.3 frequency, and was rebranded as 92.3 K-Rock.\n\nWFNY's ratings plummeted with the change to an all-talk format. As the replacement for Howard Stern, Roth lost nearly three-quarters of Howard Stern's previous audience, dropping a 7.9 share to a 1.8. Among the core audience—18- to 34-year-old men—the numbers fell from 13.8 to 1.3. Overall station ratings went from 3.2 in Summer/Fall of 2005 to 2.7 in Winter of 2006, and later to a 2.0, leaving it in 20th place in the New York market.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, Chris Booker, host of \"The Booker Show\", announced that he was broadcasting his last show on Free FM. He soon moved over the morning show at Q102 in Philadelphia. The abrupt end of his show, which had evolved on afternoon drive before the format switch, led the station to revert to \"Free Rock\" music at nights.\n\nThe following day, on April 26, 2006, \"Opie and Anthony\" replaced David Lee Roth in morning drive on Free FM, while simulcasting on XM Satellite Radio. The show aired from 6–9 am on both terrestrial and satellite radio, then continued on XM exclusively to 11 am.\n\nBy spring 2007, Opie and Anthony managed to slightly improve WFNY-FM's ratings to a 1.4. However, this performance left the radio station ranked #22 of 25 in the NY market.\n\nWeekends continued to use the \"Free Rock Weekend\" format, which included hour-long \"Freecasts\" in which a single listener chose the (approximately 15) songs played during the hour. The listener also acted as guest DJ over the phone during the time.\n\nThe station was also used as a secondary broadcaster of sister station WFAN, serving as a secondary outlet for NFL football games, New Jersey Devils hockey games and New Jersey Nets basketball games when there was a conflict with another game on WFAN.\n\nAfter Jim Cramer's \"Real Money\" went off the air on in December 2006, WFNY-FM was left with just 4 talk shows (one from syndication). As a result, the station attempted to revamp its lineup with the addition of several new talk shows, the first of which occurred on December 20, 2006. \"Ron and Fez\", who also have a show on XM radio, signed an agreement to broadcast a 92.3 Free FM-exclusive radio show from 6pm to 9pm. Ron and Fez had previously been employed by CBS at WNEW-FM shortly after that station switched to FM Talk in 1999.\n\nAdditional new shows soon followed. On December 28, 2006, John and Jeff started being broadcast from syndication out of sister station 97.1 Free FM in Los Angeles. They broadcast live 2–6 am. On January 2, 2007, Larry Wachs, who was half of \"The Regular Guys\" morning show on WKLS-FM in Atlanta, began hosting the 10pm to midnight slot on the station for 2 weeks. That same day, Nick DiPaolo became host of the 12pm to 3pm time slot. He had done some preview shows the previous week. Beginning January 3, \"Loveline with Dr. Drew Pinsky & Stryker\" aired Late Nights, tape delayed, from 12am to 2am.\n\nDanni was Free FM's Music Director and was still a Free Rock disc jockey. She has been heard doing DJ shifts on co-owned Fresh 102.7 as well. Free Rock Weekends aired 6am Saturday – 12am Sunday, and 6am Sunday – 2am Monday. Game Show Radio ran 12–2am on Sundays, while infomercials ran 2am–6am Sunday.\n\nFree FM was using guest hosts for the 10pm to 12am time slot. March 2, 2007 was the last day for the Penn Jillette show on Free FM and CBS Radio stations. The following Monday, WFNY-FM expanded the guest host time slot by an hour, making it 9pm to 12am.\n\nIn April 2007, during an interview with a local band \"A Brief Smile\" on \"The Dog House\", the hosts JV and Elvis directed numerous homophobic insults at the band's bassist. The hosts referred to the bassist as \"Fag Number 1\" and asked, \"How many badges of honor do you have in your colon?\" and kicked him out of the studio. After playing a song by the band the hosts also called the bass part \"a little faggy.\" The bass player returned to the studio, stated he was bisexual and that he found their use of the word \"faggot\" offensive. Gay rights groups such as GLAAD criticized the show as being homophobic for their remarks.\n\nJV and Elvis were later suspended on April 30 over a six-minute prank phone call peppered with ethnic and sexual slurs to a Chinese restaurant, after numerous Chinese American advocacy groups complained to CBS demanding the hosts be fired.\n\nBeginning on May 7, Free-FM started using guest hosts 9 am to 12 pm to replace \"The Dog House\". On May 12, 2007, AP News reported that CBS Radio spokeswoman Karen Mateo said, \"The Dog House with JV and Elvis will no longer be broadcast [on Free-FM].\" CBS fired the co-hosts JV and Elvis, as well as the producer of \"The Dog House\" after numerous complaints received from various civil rights groups.\n\nOn May 15, 2007, XM Satellite Radio suspended the \"Opie and Anthony Show\" for 30 days because of comments made by a homeless man about raping Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and First Lady Laura Bush made on an uncensored May 9 broadcast. Their suspension was effective immediately. During this time, CBS Radio kept the show on from 6 to 9am. However, it was not simulcast on XM.\n\nAt 9 a.m. on May 24, 2007, after \"Opie and Anthony\", an eight-hour countdown clock began on the former \"Free FM\" website and a sound collage was broadcast for most of the day. The stunting came to an end at 4:57 p.m. with an apology from general manager Tom Chiusano, who apologized to listeners for taking K-Rock away. Minutes later, at 5 p.m., the station returned to the air as K-Rock, playing an alternative rock format with a playlist focused on rock from the 1990s and 2000s, along with heavy classic rock. The first song on the resurrected K-Rock was \"All Apologies\" by Nirvana, while the first host on air was Gregg \"Opie\" Hughes of Opie and Anthony, who confirmed that O&A would still be on the station under its new format.\n\nThe station reverted to its previous call letters, WXRK, on May 31, 2007. The previous WXRK (92.3 K-Rock in Cleveland, also owned by CBS Radio) received the callsign WKRI. The Cleveland station is now WKRK-FM.\n\nInitially, WXRK had no on-air staff, although on Mondays it featured a \"Hostile Takeover\" show where guest(s) sat in as the DJ. The station also had contests which begun after \"Opie and Anthony\".\n\nOn February 8, 2008, it was announced that program director Tracy Cloherty was among the many non-programming staffers let go by CBS Radio, in an attempt to \"more effectively monetize the aggregate number of listeners who hear us on the radio and the Internet.\" The advent of WRXP caused WXRK to morph to active rock at that time.\n\nIn December 2008, as a result of another change in the station's management, K-Rock made an adjustment to a mainstream rock format focusing more on classic rock and playing even less current rock songs. With the format adjustment, Paul Turner, who was the voice of the Howard Stern Show and K-Rock when it was a classic rock station in the 1990s, returned as voice of the station's promos.\n\nAs a result of the format shift, on December 16, 2008, FMQB announced that afternoon jock Ian Camfield had left K-Rock to go back to XFM in London. K-Rock vet Chris Booker took his place, airing in afternoon drive from 2−7 pm.\n\nDue to low ratings, the final terrestrial airing of \"Opie and Anthony\" show aired on March 9, 2009.\n\nAt 4:45 p.m. on March 11, 2009, after playing \"Right Now\" by Van Halen, WXRK began stunting with the sound of a ticking clock. At 4:55 p.m., the station announced that K-Rock was moving to 92.3 HD2, and after an introductory package, officially flipped to a rhythmic-leaning CHR format, branded as \"92.3 Now\". The first song on \"Now\" was \"Boom Boom Pow\" by The Black Eyed Peas.\n\nBy July 2012, major directional changes were made with a shift to a more mainstream Top 40 format. The station also added Ty Bentli for mornings. This would eventually become known as \"Ty Loves NY.\"\n\nOn November 8, 2012, a full 3 1/2 years after Now's debut, the station changed call letters to WNOW-FM to match their moniker. This was made possible by a format and call-letter change at the former WNOW-FM in Gaffney, South Carolina.\n\nOn December 17, 2010, WXRK afternoon host Mark \"Tic Tak\" Allen pulled an on-air tirade in which he dissed the music director (while he was in West Virginia, on vacation) and went against playing the usual Top 40 songs, including \"slamming\" Katy Perry singles, by declaring that \"I'm playing what I want... this is my Christmas present to you\" and started mixing in certain songs that do not fit WXRK's current format. Allen was hoping that station management would fire him, but from the comments from message boards like Radio-Info, this \"event\" was either staged or a poor ratings ploy to attract more listeners, since Allen has been known to pull successful stunts at other stations that he had worked at in the past.\n\nOn January 17, 2012, Howard Stern made a live appearance on WXRK for the first time in over six years. Stern was a guest on the Nick Cannon morning show, via telephone, at the same time as Cannon was guesting on Stern's SiriusXM Satellite Radio show.\n\nAs a result of damage suffered to WINS' transmitter during Hurricane Sandy, WINS was being broadcast on 92.3. Although its transmitters were restored, WINS' transmitters were on low power for at least a day. The simulcast ended at 10 a.m. on October 31, 2012, when WINS' transmitter went back to full power.\n\nFollowing the station's flip in 2009, WXRK/WNOW held only a 2 share as compared to WHTZ, which usually has a 7 share of the market. In addition, WXRK/WNOW had a constant turnover of program directors and airstaff, including the sudden releasing of all the then-current airstaff (with the exception of midday host Niko and evening host Toro) on May 21, 2014, as rumors of a complete rehauling of 92.3's format abounded. The following day at 2 p.m., after stunting by giving away $1,000 to callers every 9 minutes for 2 hours, WNOW-FM relaunched as \"92.3 AMP Radio\" under veteran PD Rick Thomas, launching with commercial-free weekends until Labor Day weekend. The final song on \"Now\" was \"Lose Yourself\" by Eminem, while the first song on \"AMP\" was \"Summer\" by Calvin Harris. On June 23, 2014, WNOW-FM changed its call letters to WBMP to match the \"AMP\" branding (unlike Los Angeles sister station KAMP-FM, the WAMP call letters are held by an American Family Radio religious talk radio station in Jackson, Tennessee, and the network's conservative foundational owner was unlikely to give them to a commercial operation). Concurrently, the WNOW-FM call letters were transferred to WNOU in Indianapolis, Indiana. After the rebrand, the station's ratings improved significantly. On January 22, 2015, WBMP launched a new morning show titled \"Shoboy in the Morning\" with Edgar \"Shoboy\" Sotelo, Micho Rizzo (both of whom were once part of sister station KMVK in Dallas) and Nina Hajian from then-sister station KZZO in Sacramento.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was completed on November 17. On that day, at 10 a.m., after playing \"Too Good at Goodbyes\" by Sam Smith and \"Encore\" by Brooklyn native Jay-Z, WBMP flipped back to alternative as \"Alt 92.3\", launching with \"My Hero\" by the Foo Fighters. The switch marked the return of the format to the market for the first time since 2012, when WRXP switched to a simulcast of WFAN as WFAN-FM after its sale to CBS. A sister \"AMP\" station in Dallas, KVIL, also flipped to alternative with a similar brand the same day. On June 12, 2018, the call letters were changed to WNYL to match their format.\n\nAs part of the K-Rock format change on April 4, 2005 from alternative rock to mainstream rock, K-Rock2, a new Internet-only radio station, was created. Throughout the Free FM period and during the resurrection of K-Rock, K-Rock2 continued to stream on krock2.com. Following the main channel's format change to \"Now\" on March 11, 2009, the HD2 channel became known as simply \"K-Rock\", but retained the alternative rock format. K-Rock HD2, at one point had a full-time air staff, including a local music show, but later ran completely automated.\n\nStarting shortly after 2 a.m. on October 6, 2008, the K-Rock2 audio stream was added to WXRK-HD2. A few minutes earlier, a simulcast of sister station WFAN was added to WXRK HD3. 92.3-HD3 was initially using the delayed audio feed from wfan.com complete with internet only commercials and not the over the air broadcast feed used by WFAN on 660 AM. After a day or so, WXRK HD3 switched to the over the air feed of WFAN, but still had a time delay of over a minute. The HD3 was dropped altogether when WFAN began simulcasting on 101.9 FM on November 2, 2012. In December 2015, WBMP added Radio Disney to HD3 under a time brokerage agreement, making the return of the radio network to New York since Radio Disney's owned-and-operated WQEW (now WFME) was sold to Family Radio in February of that year (which would be discontinued in February 2018 after the agreement between Disney and Entercom, which inherited the agreement from CBS, expired). After the analog/HD1 channel's flip back to alternative in November 2017, the HD2 channel changed to a simulcast of sister station WNEW-FM. As of October 2018, WNYL's HD2 channel flipped to New Alternative as \"New Arrivals\".\n\nIn February 2019, WNYL launched an LGBTQ-centric talk/dance format on its reactivated HD3 subchannel, branded as \"Channel Q\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1888548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888548", "title": "Azalai", "text": "Azalai\n\nThe Azalai (Tamasheq, var. Azalay) is a semi-annual salt caravan route practiced by Tuareg traders in the Sahara desert between Timbuktu and the Taoudenni salt mine in Mali, or the act of traveling with a caravan along that route.\n\nThe other major West African salt caravan route, heading from around Agadez to Fachi and Bilma in Niger, is called Taghlamt (in Tamasheq, or Taglem or Tagalem in Hausa language).\n\nThe two are among the last caravan routes in the Sahara that are still in use. Both caravans have largely been replaced by unpaved truck routes.\n\nAt one time the caravan route from Timbuktu extended through Taoudenni to Taghaza, another salt-mining site, and on to the lands north of the Sahara on the Mediterranean Sea. Caravans with up to 10,000 camels carried gold and slaves north, returning with manufactured goods and salt from Taghaza and Taoudenni. Until the 1940s, the Taoudenni caravans were made up of thousands of camels, departing Timbuktu at the beginning of the cool season in November, with a smaller caravan departing Timbuktu at the beginning of the hot season in March.\n\nAfter the Azalai reaches Timbuktu, the rock salt it is taken by boat to Mopti and further on to other Sahel and Sudanian markets.\n\nThe Agadez-Bilma route, passing through the Ténéré desert and the oasis town of Fachi, takes around three weeks to complete (both ways). It is traditionally a twice yearly caravan from the capital of the Aïr region to the natron salt pans along the string of oases formed by the Kaouar cliffs. Food and supplies were carried from Agadez each November and March and traded for bricks of salt, condensed in the natron pits of oasis towns, and to a lesser extent, dates and vegetables. The salt was then generally traded for animal use in the Hausaland regions to the south.\n\nThe Agadez-Bilma Taghlamt was historically a monopoly of the Tuareg, and successively the Kel Gress, Kel Owey and Kel Ayr confederations in particular. Many Tuareg traders owned the salt pits and date plantations in Kaouar, as well as holding bonded laborers there, and traveled the caravan to administer their property. The Tuareg Taghlamt, numbering 10,000 camels and stretching 25 km at the beginning of the colonial period, is led by the representative of the Amenokal (confederation leader), followed by each sub group.\n\nThe Camel was introduced into the Sahara in the late first millennium, and Tuareg tribes moved south into the region in the 13th century. In the 18th century, Tuareg confederations captured the Kaouar oases from the Kanem-Bornu Empire and began transporting goods from Agadez.\n\nThe disruptions of the French colonial expansion in the first years of the 20th century led to inter clan rivalries, and later, the rise of mechanised traffic. In 1904, Ouled Sliman raiders from what is now Chad destroyed the caravan at Bilma, and again in 1906 at Fachi. The French reported that the 1906 caravan numbered 20,000 camels. Following the Kaocen revolt, no Taghlamt traveled the route until 1925, and then it was accompanied by French colonial forces. By 1948, the caravans had shrunk to 8000 camels, and continued to shrink thereafter. The northern road route, marked by the Tree of Ténéré, has supplanted most camel trains, but small Taghlamt trains continue to head out each November.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1888551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888551", "title": "Nevile Wilkinson", "text": "Nevile Wilkinson\n\nMajor Sir Nevile Rodwell Wilkinson, KCVO (26 October 1869 – 22 December 1940), was a British officer of arms, British Army officer, author and a dollhouse designer.\n\nWilkinson was born in Highgate, Middlesex, the son of a barrister. He was educated at Harrow School and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1889. He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in 1890, promoted Lieutenant on 1 July 1896, and Captain on 1 April 1899. He served twice with his regiment in the Second Boer War, the second time from April 1902 when he was in command of reinforcements of 250 officers and men. They left Southampton in the troopship \"Dilwara\" on 15 April, arriving in South Africa the following month. He retired from the army in 1907, although he returned to service in the First World War as a staff officer. He was promoted Major in 1915.\n\nThe office of Ulster King of Arms, Principal Herald of Ireland, was created 1552 by Edward VI, with full jurisdiction over Irish heraldry. There were two disparate heraldic traditions in Ireland at that time – the old Gaelic Irish tradition, and the Norman and Anglo-Irish traditions which were part of the European heraldic mainstream. At this time, Ulster King of Arms was Principal officer of arms of all Ireland.\n\nMost of Ulster King of Arms's work was heraldic rather than genealogical, although collecting genealogies and proving pedigrees were essential to ensure that arms were used and inherited by the rightful heirs. However, from the start of the eighteenth century Ulster began to acquire other duties, as an officer of the crown intimately linked to the government. These duties were largely ceremonial. For example, Ulster King of Arms had to decide and arrange precedence on state occasions at the court of the English Viceroy (later Lord Lieutenant) of Ireland, formally introduce new peers to the Irish House of Lords, and record peerage successions. An additional responsibility came in 1783, when Ulster King of Arms became registrar for the newly established chivalric Order of St Patrick. This was an Irish equivalent of such long-established English institutions as the Order of the Garter. Ulster became its registrar, responsible for administering its affairs. He continued to be responsible for the recording of peerage successions, since Irish peers (like Scottish peers) were allowed to elect representative peers to the House of Lords at Westminster until 1922. The heraldic and ceremonial duties of Ulster continued down to the twentieth century until 1922. The post was effectively in suspense between 1940 and 1943, after which the heraldic and genealogical duties were carried out by a Chief Herald of Ireland.\n\nWilkinson was appointed Ulster King of Arms in 1908, succeeding the disgraced previous office-holder Sir Arthur Vicars after the theft of the St Patrick regalia in 1907. He was the last person to hold that office. As such, he was Principal Officer of Arms of Ireland, and one of the chief heraldic officers in the United Kingdom. It is not known what his qualifications for the job were, apart from his undoubted artistic abilities and his marriage to a well-born lady.\n\nHis job was to manage Irish heraldry – mostly the granting and use of arms. He was also to examine the genealogical records and pedigree relating to Irish families, and to maintain the register of members of the Order of St Patrick, as the premier civilian honour for Irish peers and others. The order was suspended 1922 after the promulgation of the Irish Free State.\n\nMajor Wilkinson apparently spent most of his time in London at the Office of the Keeper of Royal Arms. It is not clear why he did so, given that the Office of Arms (and presumably all records) were located in the Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle. By 1923, Wilkinson had begun visiting the office regularly, which caused a minor political problem for the fledgling Irish Government for sixteen years. It was discovered around 1923 that the office of Ulster King of Arms had not been legally transferred to the Irish Government and since the office was created by Royal Prerogative in 1552, the British Government said that they could not transfer the office to Ireland. Eventually, the Irish Government decided in 1930 to let Wilkinson continue his work until his death, at which point the office would be considered by the Irish Government to have lapsed.\n\nThe National Library of Ireland website shows that Wilkinson granted and confirmed arms right up to 1940. Indeed, more than two dozen confirmations of arms are dated 21 December 1940, the day before he died.\n\nOne of Wilkinson's achievements in his capacity as Ulster King of Arms was the establishment of the State Heraldic Museum in 1909.\n\nWilkinson was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) after the visit of King George V to Dublin in 1911, knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours, and appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) after the state opening of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in June 1921.\n\nWilkinson married Lady Beatrix Francis Gertrude Herbert, first daughter of the 14th Earl of Pembroke and his wife Lady Beatrix Lambton, herself eldest daughter of George Lambton, 2nd Earl of Durham, in 1903. The couple moved into Mount Merrion House, south Co. Dublin, Ireland, where they lived until the start of the First World War in 1914. They had two daughters, Guendolen and Phyllis. To celebrate their births, two redwood trees were planted opposite the entrance to the Church of St Therese.\n\nWilkinson built two famous dollhouses, Titania's Palace (completed and inaugurated in 1922 by Queen Mary) and Pembroke Palace (completed in 1907). Titania's Palace remained in the family for many years, but was sold after 1960 first to an English amusement park, then to Legoland and is currently lent to Egeskov Castle. Pembroke Palace Dolls House is now at Wilton House, seat and home of the 18th Earl of Pembroke.\n\nWilkinson was survived by his widow and his two daughters.

He was the first director of the Lunar Section of the British Astronomical Association (BAA), and is remembered by the lunar crater Elger.\n\nThomas Elger was born on 27 October 1836 in Bedford, where his family had been established for several generations, and educated at Bedford School. His father Thomas Gwyn Elger (1794 – 1841) was an architect and builder. Grandfather, father and son engaged in town politics, and all held the post of mayor.\n\nElger studied at University College London and adopted the profession of a civil engineer. He was engaged in several important works, including the Metropolitan Railway and the Severn Valley Railway. However, his surveys for railway construction in Holstein were put to a stop by the war with Prussia and Austria in 1864.\n\nSoon afterwards he relinquished the active pursuit of his profession and devoted himself to scientific studies. He had developed a strong taste for astronomy already at an early age and erected his first observatory in Bedford.\n\nElger observed with an 8.5 inch reflector. His sketches from 1884 to 1896 are now in the possession of the BAA. He is best known as a careful and indefatigable selenographer, and for this work his artistic skill eminently qualified him.\n\nHe is most remembered for his book \"The Moon: A full Description and Map of its Principal Physical Features.\" Published in 1895, its maps are still highly regarded by lunar observers due to their uncluttered nature.\n\nThe visual brightness of lunar features is expressed in the \"Elger's Lunar Albedo Scale\". This scale had been established in 1791 by the German astronomer Johann Hieronymus Schröter and popularized by Elger.\n\nElger was a member of several astronomical associations, and he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 10 February 1871. He was a founding member of the short-lived Selenographical Society, in 1878, President of the Liverpool Astronomical Society, and a founding member of the British Astronomical Association, in 1890, becoming the first director of its Lunar Section. He was appointed an associate of the Astronomical Society of Wales, a form of honorary membership.\nBesides his astronomical work, he was an ardent archaeologist and founded the Bedfordshire Natural History Society and Field Club.\n\nThomas Gwyn Elger died on 9 January 1897, aged 60, and the lunar crater Elger was named in his honour in 1912.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1888553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888553", "title": "Eastern newt", "text": "Eastern newt\n\nThe eastern newt (\"Notophthalmus viridescens\") is a common newt of eastern North America. It frequents small lakes, ponds, and streams or nearby wet forests. The eastern newt produces tetrodotoxin, which makes the species unpalatable to predatory fish and crayfish. It has a lifespan of 12 to 15 years in the wild, and it may grow to in length. These animals are common aquarium pets, being either collected from the wild or sold commercially. The striking bright orange juvenile stage, which is land-dwelling, is known as a red eft. Some sources blend the general name of the species and that of the red-spotted newt subspecies into the eastern red-spotted newt (although there is no \"western\" one).\n\nThe eastern newt includes these four subspecies: \n\nThe central newt (\"N. v. lousianensis\") is a subspecies of the eastern newt.\n\nCentral newts measure from to in length. They are brown or green, with fine black dots all over the body. There may be a row of red spots on each side of the body. The belly is yellow or orange and is noticeably lighter than the rest of the body. The skin of newts is not as slippery as the skin of salamanders and may appear to be rough and dry for parts of their lives.\n\nEastern newts have three stages of life: (1) the aquatic larva or tadpole, (2) the red eft or terrestrial juvenile stage, and (3) the aquatic adult.\n\nThe larva possesses gills and does not leave the pond environment where it was hatched. Larvae are brown-green, and shed their gills when they transform into the red eft.\n\nThe red eft (juvenile) stage is a bright orangish-red, with darker red spots outlined in black. An eastern newt can have as many as 21 of these spots. The pattern of these spots differs among the subspecies. An eastern newt's time to get from larva to eft is about three months. During this stage, the eft may travel far, acting as a dispersal stage from one pond to another, ensuring outcrossing in the population. The striking coloration of this stage is an example of aposematism — or \"warning coloration\" — which is a type of antipredator adaptation in which a \"warning signal\" is associated with the unprofitability of a prey item (i.e., its toxicity) to potential predators.\n\nAfter two or three years, the eft finds a pond and transforms into the aquatic adult. The adult's skin is a dull olive green dorsally, with a dull yellow belly, but retains the eft's characteristic black-rimmed red spots. It develops a larger, blade-like tail and characteristically slimy skin.\n\nIt is common for the peninsula newt (\"N. v. piaropicola\") to be neotenic, with a larva transforming directly into a sexually mature aquatic adult, never losing its external gills. The red eft stage is in these cases skipped.\n\nEastern newts home using magnetic orientation. Their magnetoreception system seems to be a hybrid of polarity-based inclination and a sun-dependent compass. Shoreward-bound eastern newts will orient themselves quite differently under light with wavelengths around 400 nm than light with wavelengths around 600 nm, while homing newts will orient themselves the same way under both short and long wavelengths. Ferromagnetic material, probably biogenic magnetite, is likely present in the eastern newt's body.\n\nEastern newts are at home in both coniferous and deciduous forests. They need a moist environment with either a temporary or permanent body of water, and thrive best in a muddy environment. During the eft stage, they may travel far from their original location. Red efts may often be seen in a forest after a rainstorm. Adults prefer a muddy aquatic habitat, but will move to land during a dry spell. Eastern newts have some amount of toxins in their skin, which is brightly colored to act as a warning. Even then, only 2% of larvae make it to the eft stage. Some larvae have been found in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant \"Sarracenia purpurea\".\n\nEastern newts eat a variety of prey, such as insects, small mollusks and crustaceans, young amphibians, worms, and frog eggs.\nAlthough eastern newts are widespread throughout North America, they, like many other species of amphibians, are increasingly threatened by several factors including habitat fragmentation, climate change, invasive species, over-exploitation, and emergent infectious diseases. Wild eastern newts are known hosts of \"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\" and \"Ranavirus\". They are also highly susceptible to the newly emergent chytrid fungus \"Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1888554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888554", "title": "Préludes (Debussy)", "text": "Préludes (Debussy)\n\nClaude Debussy's Préludes are 24 pieces for solo piano, divided into two books of 12 preludes each. Unlike some notable collections of preludes from prior times, such as Chopin's Op. 28, or the preludes from Johann Sebastian Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Debussy's do not follow a strict pattern of key signatures.\n\nEach book was written in a matter of months, at an unusually fast pace for Debussy. Book I was written between December 1909 and February 1910, and Book II between the last months of 1912 and early April 1913. \n\nTwo of the titles were set in quotation marks by Debussy because they are, in fact, quotations: \"«Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir»\" is from Charles Baudelaire's poem \"Harmonie du soir\" (\"Evening Harmony\"). \"«Les fées sont d'exquises danseuses»\" is from J. M. Barrie's book \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\", which Debussy's daughter had received as a gift.\n\nThere is no proof that Debussy necessarily intended the preludes to be performed as a cycle, although the musical language throughout each book is so consistent that performers usually do so.\n\nAn important precedent was set on 3 May 1911 by the pianist Jane Mortier (to whom works were dedicated by Bohuslav Martinů and Erik Satie) who played the entire first book of preludes at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. The German-English pianist Walter Morse Rummel, a student of Leopold Godowsky, gave the premiere of the entire second book of preludes in 1913 in London.\n\nInitially, Debussy and other pianists who gave early performances of the works (including Ricardo Viñes) played them in groups of three or four preludes, which remains a popular approach today. This allows performers to choose preludes with which they have the strongest affinity, or those to which their individual interpretive gifts are most suited.\n\nThere is a strong tonal relationship between the preludes that suggests that the published order of the preludes is not arbitrary. For example, the first three preludes in the first book (\"Danseuses de Delphes\", \"Voiles\", and \"Le Vent dans la Plaine\") revolve around the key of B. In these first three preludes, allusions to the key of B disappear and reappear, yet a strong sense of fluidity and connection between the preludes is still maintained.\n\nHowever, the order of the preludes is not considered imperative, as is the case with Chopin's preludes, for example. Several pianists have performed the set out of order, and at least one recording, by Ivan Ilić, changes the order of the set entirely.\n\nThe first complete recording of both sets was made in England in 1938 by the South African pianist Adolph Hallis.\n\nThe titles of the preludes are highly significant, both in terms of their descriptive quality and in the way they were placed in the written score. The titles are written at the end of each work, allowing the performer to experience each individual sound world without being influenced by Debussy's titles beforehand.\n\nAt least one of the titles is poetically vague: the exact meaning of \"Voiles\", the title of the second prelude of the first book, is impossible to determine for certain, since plural nouns do not distinguish genders as the singular forms may do (in French, \"voiles\" can mean either \"veils\" or \"sails\").\n\nThe title of the fourth prelude \"«Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir»\" represents a citation from Charles Baudelaire’s poem \"Harmonie du soir\" from his volume of poems \"Les Fleurs du mal\".\n\nNumerous orchestrations have been made of the various preludes, mostly of \"La fille aux cheveux de lin\" and \"La cathédrale engloutie\". Complete orchestrations of all 24 preludes include versions by Peter Breiner, Luc Brewaeys, Hans Henkemans, and Colin Matthews. Sean Osborn and conductor Noam Zur have orchestrated the first book. \n\n\n\n"}

It was the first Soviet order established during the war, and the first Soviet order divided into classes. Its statute precisely defined, which deeds are awarded with the order, e.g. shooting down three aircraft as a fighter pilot, or destroying two heavy or three medium or four light tanks, or capturing a warship, or repairing an aircraft under fire after landing on a hostile territory, and so on, were awarded with the first class. It was also given to some allied troops and commanders, including western allies. Altogether, over 324,903 of the 1st class and 951,652 of the 2nd class were issued during the war. Until 1985, the total number reached about 1,370,000.\n\nIn 1985, during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War, it was decided that all surviving veterans of the war would be awarded either 2nd or 1st class of the Order, and about 2,054,000 first class and 5,408,000 second class were issued then.\n\nAs of January 1992, the total number of all awarded Orders was 2,487,098 first class and 6,688,497 second class variants.\n\nIt featured a red enamel five-pointed star, made of silver, with straight rays in the background, and crossed sabre and a Mosin rifle. The rays in the background were golden for 1st Class and silver for 2nd Class. The central disc had a golden hammer and sickle on a red enamel background, surrounded by a white enamel ring with the words ОТЕЧЕСТВЕННАЯ ВОЙНА (\"Patriotic War\"). Originally the Order was attached to a plain red ribbon much like the Gold Star award, but from June 1943 the Order was to be worn on the right chest without ribbon; on less formal occasions a ribbon bar, dark red with a bright red central stripe for the 1st Class, or dark red with bright red edge stripes for the 2nd Class, may be worn instead.\n\nAnniversary orders of 1985 were made cheaper, as a single silver piece, gold-plated in the 1st class.\n\n"}

Operated by the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority (MECA), the facility has an 18,975-seat arena, a exhibition hall, and of meeting space.\n\nThe complex opened on September 20, 2003 as Qwest Center Omaha, and adopted the name of CenturyLink Center Omaha on July 15, 2011, as part of a buyout of Qwest by CenturyLink (formerly CenturyTel). In July 2018, CHI Health bought the naming rights to the arena under a 20-year agreement worth $23.6 million, and the arena was renamed CHI Health Center Omaha effective September 1, that year.\n\nJust west of the Missouri River, the elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe arena hosts basketball and hockey games, professional wrestling events, concerts, and the annual shareholders' meeting of Omaha-based conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, usually held on the first Saturday of May.\n\nThe arena's primary tenant is the Creighton University men's basketball team. Through the 2014–15 NCAA ice hockey season, the Omaha Mavericks men's ice hockey team, representing the University of Nebraska Omaha, was also a primary tenant, but the Mavericks moved to the new Baxter Arena effective with the 2015–16 season.\n\nIn 2000, Omaha voters approved a $216 million bond issue to build a new convention center and arena; the remainder of the $291 million project was provided by private organizations and individuals. The facility design was led by architectural firm DLR Group. Naming rights to the arena were purchased by Qwest.\n\nQwest Center Omaha opened in September 2003 with an initial seating capacity of 17,000 for concerts, 15,500 for basketball, and 14,700 for hockey. In 2006, a $5.7-million expansion of the arena increased capacity by approximately 1,500 seats.\n\nThe Qwest Center displaced the 1954 Omaha Civic Auditorium as the city's premier indoor arena. The venerable Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum closed in 2002 and was demolished in 2005.\n\nThe arena has hosted games in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament four times: first- and second-round games in 2008, 2012, and 2015; and Midwest Regional games (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight) in 2018. The arena was planned to host the 2020 tournament's first- and second-round games, but the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The arena also hosted the 2010 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships, and was home to the WWE Judgment Day 2008 pay-per-view, as well as other events from WWE. The arena has also five championship boxing cards, all involving Omaha native Terence Crawford as he wanted to defend his titles in front of a home crowd. His first bout at the arena, against Yuriorkis Gamboa for the WBO lightweight belt in 2014, was the first championship fight in Nebraska since the Joe Frazier-Ron Stander bout in 1971.\n\nThe center hosted the nationally televised USA Swimming Summer Olympics trials in 2008, 2012 and 2016.

The Omaha Fire Department pumped in of water from hydrants around the center.\n\nThe 2008 event averaged more than 12,000 spectators each night.\n\nA storm damaged a portion of the roof known as \"The Hat\" on June 27, 2008. There was no structural damage, but the damage caused water to pour into parts of the Qwest Center, flowed down two sets of arena steps and onto the deck of the competition pool for the USA Swimming Summer Olympic Trials. The schedule for the trials went on as planned.\n\nThe pools were dismantled after the event and moved to other cities for permanent installation with the 2008 pool going to the Poseidon Swimming facility in Richmond, Virginia, the 2012 pool going to Charles River Aquatics in Boston, Massachusetts and the 2016 pool going to the Hulbert Aquatic Facility in West Fargo, North Dakota (West Fargo bought the pool via a local group of swim enthusiasts called UP Aquatics for $900,000).\n\nIn 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions.\n\nIn 2001, construction began on the new convention center and arena, known as the \"Omaha Arena and Convention Center\". Architectural firm DLR Group spearheaded the design, while The Thornton-Tomasetti Group served as structural engineer. M–E Engineers, Inc. was the services engineer and a local company, Kiewit Corporation, led general construction. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 1, 2001. The venue was completed in August 2003, with an official opening on September 24, 2003.\n\nIn 2006, the MCEA funded a project to expanded the arena and add an additional 1,472 seats to the upper bowl. The project also included adding restroom facilities and concession stands, as well as updating aesthetics, mechanical systems, and emergency exits. The cost of the project was $6 million. Construction began in May and was completed September 8, 2006.\n\nIn 2009, the center saw another renovation with work enveloping the entire building. The $6 million project included new carpet, wallpaper, reupholstered arena seating, and a new scoreboard.\n\nThe convention center has placed Omaha on the convention map since opening in 2003. The center features three exhibit halls, four ballrooms and over 15 meeting rooms. \nThe arena is the busiest venue of the complex. Built in 2001, the arena was meant to replace the aging Omaha Civic Auditorium and demolished Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum. It is the largest arena in the state, seating over 18,000. It contains 32 luxury suites and over a thousand club seats. The arena hosts shows of all genres, including: concerts, family shows, sports, rodeos and circuses. The arena opened September 12, 2003, with a private concert by Grand Funk Railroad.

The show aired from 1958 to 1963.\n\nCrawford had a brief career as a recording artist in the 1950s and 1960s. He continued to act on television and in film as an adult. Beginning in 1992, Crawford led the California-based Johnny Crawford Orchestra, a vintage dance orchestra that performed at special events.\n\nCrawford was born in Los Angeles, the son of Betty (née Megerlin) and Robert Lawrence Crawford Sr. His maternal grandparents were Belgian; his maternal grandfather was violinist Alfred Eugene Megerlin. In 1959, Johnny, his older brother Robert L. Crawford Jr., a co-star of NBC's \"Laramie\" series, and their father Robert Sr. were all nominated for Emmy Awards (the brothers for acting, and their father for film editing).\n\nCrawford began his career as a child actor. One of The Walt Disney Company's original Mouseketeers in 1955, he has acted on stage, in films, and on television.\n\nDisney started out with 24 original Mouseketeers. However, at the end of the first season, the studio reduced the number to 12, and Crawford was released from his contract. His first important break as an actor followed with the title role in a Lux Video Theatre production of \"Little Boy Lost\", a live NBC broadcast on March 15, 1956. He also appeared in the popular Western series \"The Lone Ranger\", in 1956, in one of the few color episodes of that series. Following that performance, the young actor worked steadily with many seasoned actors and directors. Freelancing for two and one-half years, he accumulated almost 60 television credits, including featured roles in three episodes of NBC's \"The Loretta Young Show\" and an appearance as Manuel in, \"I Am an American\", an episode of the syndicated crime drama \"Sheriff of Cochise\".

He received the nomination for his role as Mark McCain (the son of Lucas McCain, played by Chuck Connors) in the American Broadcasting Company series \"The Rifleman\". Crawford also played a young boy named Clay Holden who befriends Connors in a 1965 episode of “Branded”. Throughout \"The Rifleman\"'s five seasons, a remarkable on-screen chemistry existed between Connors and Crawford in the depiction of their father-son relationship. They were still close friends when Connors died on November 10, 1992, and Crawford gave a eulogy at Connors' memorial service.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, Crawford had wide popularity with American teenagers and a recording career that generated four \"Billboard\" Top 40 hits, including the single \"Cindy's Birthday\", which peaked at number 8 in 1962. His other hits included \"Rumors\" (number 12, 1962), \"Your Nose is Gonna Grow\" (number 14, 1962), and \"Proud\" (number 29, 1963).\n\nLate in 1961, Crawford appeared as Victor in the episode \"A Very Bright Boy\" of the ABC sitcom, \"The Donna Reed Show\".

The formal name of the band was JCO (Johnny Crawford Orchestra). The JCO logo appeared on Crawford's drums when the band played in Las Vegas. The band has been sponsored by the Playboy Jazz Festival, and the orchestra has been the choice for 15 consecutive annual Art Directors Guild Awards shows at the Beverly Hilton, in Beverly Hills. A remastered version of the orchestra's highly rated first album, \"Sweepin' the Clouds Away\", was released on August 21, 2012, on the CD Baby (distributor) label.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Crawford dated Debra Tate, sister of the late actress Sharon Tate.\n\nCrawford reconnected with his high school sweetheart, Charlotte Samco, in 1990, and they married in 1995.\n\nIn 2019, multiple sources reported that Crawford had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n"}

It is set over the course of about one week in 1945 in a Joseph Stalin-era Soviet prison camp. As in many of Solzhenitsyn's works, the author paints a vivid and honest picture of the suffering prisoners and their incompetent but powerful wardens. Most of the prisoners depicted in the play are serving 10 year sentences for violations of Soviet Penal Code Article 58.\n\nIn this play, the author first explores the analogy of the camp system to a separate nation within the Soviet Union, an analogy which would dominate his later work, most clearly in \"The Gulag Archipelago\".\n\nThe play has a fairly large cast of characters, mostly prisoners at the camp. The play has many difficult staging and set directions. Truckloads of prisoners arrive onstage, characters appear onstage pouring (and spilling) molten iron in a camp foundry, and one scene calls for a three-story building in the foreground of the set, with layered barbed wire and bare steppe stretching into the background \"as far as the eye can see,\" with an excavator operating in the distance. Despite this, the play has been performed in public many times, making its American premiere at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1970.\n\nA television adaptation of the play was broadcast by the BBC in the \"Play of the Month\" series in 1973.\n\nThe prisoner Nemov, apparently the story's hero, is an honest man serving a term of 10 years for violations of Article 58. At the play's start, Nemov is the production chief of his work group and is later replaced by, Prisoner Engineer Khomich. One of the play's clear recurring themes is the idea that Nemov's honesty is worthless in the face of the realities of camp life. All of the characters who prosper in the play can only do so by means of moral compromises.\n\nThe most accessible and traditional plot element is the romance between the two prisoners Nemov (the \"innocent\" of the title) and Lyuba (the \"love-girl\"). Nemov learns that Lyuba is having sex with the camp doctor Mereshchun in exchange for better food and living conditions. When Nemov demands that she stop seeing Mereshchun, Lyuba refuses and a conflict arises.\n\nThis lovers' conflict does not arise until almost the end of the play, in the final scene of Act III. Their dilemma is apparently resolved in the very brief Act IV, at the end of which an injured and dejected Nemov watches Lyuba enter Mereshchun's office yet again.\n\nThe title of the play suggests that the romance of Nemov and Lyuba is meant to be the central plot element, but the romance occupies relatively little stage time. Most of the play is spent in developing the characters of Nemov and Lyuba as they live and work in total ignorance of each other, and in exploring the realities of camp life. Much of the play develops characters and situations that have little or nothing at all to do with the specifics of the romance.\n"}

{"id": "1888612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888612", "title": "Weeping statue", "text": "Weeping statue\n\nA weeping statue is a statue which has been claimed to have shed tears or to be weeping by supernatural means. Statues weeping tears which appear to be blood, oil, and scented liquids have all been reported. Other claimed phenomena are sometimes associated with weeping statues such as miraculous healing, the formation of figures in the tear lines, and the scent of roses. These events are generally reported by Christians, and initially attract pilgrims, but are in most cases disallowed by the Church as proven hoaxes.\n\nReported weeping statues are most often of the Virgin Mary and are at times accompanied by claims of Marian apparitions. An unusual nature of the Our Lady of Akita apparitions was that unlike other cases the entire nation of Japan was able to view the tears of the statue of the Virgin Mary on national television.\n\nAuthorities of the Catholic Church have been very careful in their approach and treatment of weeping statues, and generally set very high barriers for their acceptance.\nFor instance when a statue of the popular Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina in Messina, Sicily, was found to have tears of blood one day in 2002, Church officials quickly ordered tests that showed the blood belonged to a woman and then dismissed the case as a hoax. \n\nSkeptics point to the fact that making a fake weeping statue is relatively easy. Skeptics have provided examples of weeping statues that have been obvious hoaxes.\n\nWeeping statues have also been dismissed by rationalists as a purely psychological and/or fraudulent phenomenon. The witnesses are said to be deluded by their own state of mind or strong group suggestion. In this altered state of mind, they believe they see something that isn't really there.\n\nAnother likely explanation attributes the so-called tears to condensation. The tears that statues appear to weep are actually beads of condensation accounted for by the statue being made from material of varying density, with condensation forming on the denser (colder) pieces (in this case the eyes). \n\nA number of weeping statues have been declared fake by Catholic church officials. \n\nIn 1995, a Madonna statue appeared to weep blood in the town of Civitavecchia in Italy. About 60 witnesses testified to witnessing the phenomenon. The local bishop said that he himself had seen it weep. The blood on the statue was later found to be male. The statue’s owner, Fabio Gregori, refused to take a DNA test. After the Civitavecchia case, dozens of reputedly miraculous statues were reported. Almost all were shown to be hoaxes, where blood, red paint, or water was splashed on the faces of the statues.\n\nIn 2008, church custodian Vincenzo Di Costanzo went on trial in northern Italy for faking blood on a statue of the Virgin Mary when his own DNA was matched to the blood.\n\nIn 2018, at the Our Lady Guadalupe Catholic Church in Hobbs, New Mexico, a Mary statue was reported to be producing tears. In July of that year, the Catholic Diocese of Las Cruces revealed that tests confirmed the tears in fact had the chemical composition of rose scented olive oil.\n\nPlutarch, in chapter 38 of his Life of Coriolanus, discusses the phenomenon of weeping and bleeding statues, with special reference to the case of a statue of Fortuna addressing a crowd in Rome. According to Joe Nickell, \"animated ones\", or inanimate objects that are claimed to do things such as walking, changing facial expressions, or shedding tears, are most commonly statues in the Roman Catholic tradition. In the canonical Catholic book of Daniel Chapter 14 verses 1-21 the story finds Daniel setting up a trap to catch priests who were sneaking into temples to eat the offerings left at the feet of the idol Bel, which was worshipped for its seeming ability to consume food and drink.\n\nA very small number of weeping statues have been recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, e.g. in Syracuse the shedding of tears from a statue in the house of a married couple (August 29, 1953) was recognized by the Catholic bishops of Sicily on December 13, 1953. Chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the University of Pavia, who has not examined the statue, which is behind glass, theorizes that the tears are due to capillary attraction with moisture seeping through a fault in the glaze of the plaster statue.\n\nThe following is a list of the more publicized claims. The veracity of these claims is difficult to establish and many have been declared hoaxes by Church officials.\n\nWeeping paintings or icons are a related phenomenon, but to date not a single case of a weeping painting has been approved either by the Roman Catholic or Coptic churches and most instances have turned out to be hoaxes. However, in Eastern Orthodoxy, some cases such as a weeping St Michael icon in Rhodes have been taken as miraculous. \n\nAs with weeping statues, the tears exuded are often said to be of a substance which appears to be similar to blood. A painting of the Virgin Mary is said to have exuded moisture from the eyes and the fingers at St. Nicholas Albanian Orthodox Church in Chicago on December 6, 1986. The event gained international attention and drew many onlookers to the church. The moisture ceased in July 1987, but resumed a year later at which time 19 other icons were said to have also started weeping after being \"anointed\" with the painting's moisture. A painting of Mary on plywood was said to have wept on March 10, 1992 in Barberton, Ohio; annual pilgrimages celebrating the event were still in practice as late as 2002. Another painting of the Virgin Mary which drew many visitors to Christ of the Hills Monastery near Blanco, Texas in the 1980s was said to weep myrrh, but was uncovered as a fraud in the 2000s.\n\n\n\n"}

Highlights include the dynamic \"Fix Some Food Bitch\", the melodic \"California Surf Queen\", the dramatic \"Mexican Death Horse\" and the smart ass \"Beast Le Brutale\".\n\n\"Hey Judester\", the follow-up album, was a big step forward, as the band, produced by Burgess again, was noticeably tighter and the production was accordingly beefed up. Furthermore, the Rick Didjit persona was truly crystallized, with sarcastic lyrics about bad asses, big cars, and fish dominating the proceedings. Considered by many fans to be the band's best album, the LP kicks off with the furious \"Max Wedge\" and segues directly into \"Stingray\". The first side also has the Cramps-like \"Skull Baby\", the lightning fast \"Plate in My Head\", sung from the point of view of a Vietnam vet, the heavy \"Under the Christmas Fish\", a frequent concert opener with its pounding bass and drum rhythm and Sims hooky lead guitar line, and the closer, a wobbly version of Little Richard's \"Lucille\". Side two was nearly as good, with \"Axhandle\" sounding like a cross between AC/DC and Buzzcocks, \"Joliet\" encouraging singalongs, Doug Evans's bass dominating \"King Carp\", and Sims showing that he could pen a great mid-tempo song on \"Dad\" (\"you know I really hate it/when you hit me with that belt\"), a tough guy song tinged with melancholy. \"Judester\" was the band's first album released on Touch & Go Records, and was subsequently released as a two-for-one CD with \"Fizzjob\".\n\nThe band's following solidified with the release of Hornet Pinata, which equaled, if not bettered, its predecessor. The album was littered with memorable riffs and careening, pile-driving rhythms, and perhaps the best set of lyrics on any Didjits record. Whether it was Rick Sims telling the story of a one-legged drug dealer who stored his stash in his peg leg in \"Lone Lone Ranger\" (\"just touch my leg/and Santa Claus'll get you high\"), offering a put down in \"Evel Knievel\" (\"it takes a better woman than you baby/to call me a slut\") or the pearls of wisdom dripping from \"Sweet Sweet Satan\" (\"c'mon let me tell you my recipe/it takes 10 tons of bullshit/for 10 ounces of glory\"), the album is a cackling joyride. It leads off with \"Killboy Powerhead\", later covered by The Offspring on their breakthrough album, Smash, has a worthy cover of The MC5's \"Call Me Animal\" and sloppy bash through Jimi Hendrix's \"Foxy Lady\", with bassist Doug Evans on lead vocals. The band shot a video for \"Captain Ahab\", an excellent midtempo song featuring some of Sims' most memorable guitar lines, which MTV refused to play due to drug references in the lyrics. Nevertheless, a clip of the video was shown on MTV's 120 Minutes show, and the clip contained some of those drug references. The video for \"Judge Hot Fudge\" appeared in a season five episode of Beavis and Butt-head entitled \"Choke\"; the boys were not impressed.\n\nAll of the original members of the band appeared at the Touch and Go 25th anniversary celebration in Chicago, Illinois on September 9, 2006. The next weekend, the band played another reunion show in Champaign.\n\nIn late 2016, preparations were also underway for another reunion in 2017. However, due to the death of Evans at the end of 2016, this reunion will no longer be happening.\n\nSims now works with the Lookingglass Theatre Company in Chicago and has his own business as a composer/sound designer.\n\nFor a few years, Evans resided in the Austin, Texas area where he regularly performed with his band, Blöwer (now disbanded), built nitro dragsters, and raised his children Lola Evans and Dodge Evans. He died on December 28, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the father of the actor and film director Rakesh Roshan and music director Rajesh Roshan and paternal grandfather of Hrithik Roshan.\n\nRoshan was born in Gujranwala, Punjab, British India (now part of Punjab in Pakistan). He began music lessons at a young age and later attended Marris College (now Bhatkhande Music Institute) in Lucknow under the training of Pandit S N Ratanjankar (principal of the institute). Roshan became an accomplished sarod player under the guidance of the renowned sarod player Allauddin Khan. In 1940, Khawaja Khurshid Anwar, programme producer/music, All India Radio Delhi, hired Roshan as staff artist for esraj, the instrument he used to play. He gave up this job in 1948 to seek fame and fortune in Mumbai.\n\nIn 1948, Roshan came to Mumbai to find work as a Hindi film music director and became assistant of music composer Khawaja Khurshid Anwar in film \"Singaar\" (1949). He somewhat struggled until he met the then famous producer-director Kidar Sharma, who gave him the job of composing for his film \"Neki aur Badi\" (1949). While it was a flop, Kidar Sharma gave him another chance in his next film. Roshan emerged as a player on the Hindi film music scene with \"Baawre Nain\" (1950) which became a big musical hit.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Roshan worked with singers Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh and Talat Mahmood. \"Malhar\" (1951), \"Shisham\", and Anhonee (1952 film) were some of the movies that he scored during the 1950s. During this time, he also composed the Meera bhajan which became a run-away hit, \"Aeiri main to prem diwani mera dard na jane koyi\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar for the movie \"Naubahar\" (1952).\n\nHe was not always commercially successful. He gave Indeewar and Anand Bakshi their first breaks in the Indian film industry as lyricists. Later, they became two of the most sought-after songwriters in Mumbai from the late 1960s onwards.\n\nAnand Bakshi was given his first break in 1956 by the music director Nisar Bazmi in his film \"Bhala Aadmi\" (1956). Roshan gave Bakshi the film \"CID Girl\" (1959), after Anand Bakshi wrote the four songs of \"Bhala Aadmi\" in 1956. \"Bhala Aadmi\" was released in 1958 after some delay. Together, Anand Bakshi and Roshan made a super hit musical film \"Devar\" (1966).\n\nThe 1960s proved to be the golden age for Roshan and his music. His ability to mould folk music with Hindustani classical music became his trademark and resulted in successful movie musicals. During this time, Roshan gave hits such as \"Na to karavan ki talaash hai from Barsat Ki Raat\" and \"Zindagi bhar nahi bhoolegi woh barsaat ki raat\" (\"Barsaat Ki Raat\", 1960). Barssaat Ki Raat also was a \"super hit\" film of 1960. \n\n\"Ab kya misaal doon\" and \"Kabhi to milegi, kahi to milegi\" (Aarti, 1962), \"Jo vada kiya vo nibhana padega\", \"Paao chhoon lene do\", \"Jo baat tujhmein hai\" and \"Jurm-e-ulfat pe\" (\"Taj Mahal\", 1963), \"Nigahen milane ko jee chahata hai\" and \"Laaga chunari mein daag\" (\"Dil Hi To Hai\", 1963), \"Sansaar se bhaage phirte ho\" and \"Man re tu kaahe\" (\"Chitralekha\", 1964), and \"Oh re taal mile\" and \"Khushi khushi kar do vida\" (\"Anokhi Raat\", 1968). He composed some melodies for the movie \"Mamta\" (1966) with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri, \"Rehte the kabhi jinke dil mein\" and \"Rahen Na Rahen Hum\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar and her hit duet, \"Chuppa Lo Yun Dil Mein Pyar Mera\" with Hemant Kumar. \"Devar\" (1966): \"Aaya hai mujhe phir yaad woh zalim, guzara zamana bachpan ka\"; \"Baharon ne mera chaman loot kar\"; \"Duniya mein aisa kahan sab ka naseeb hai\".\n\n\nRoshan's marked speciality was the film qawwali. He was widely hailed for their composition. \n\nRoshan had been suffering from chronic heart trouble for over 20 years. He died of a heart attack in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, on 16 November 1967, age 50, leaving behind 3 sons and 1 daughter. He had a sudden heart attack while attending a social gathering. \n\n"}

{"id": "1888698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888698", "title": "Joffrey Baratheon", "text": "Joffrey Baratheon\n\nJoffrey Baratheon is a fictional character in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIntroduced in 1996's \"A Game of Thrones\", Joffrey is the eldest son of Cersei Lannister from the continent of Westeros. He subsequently appeared in Martin's \"A Clash of Kings\" (1998) and \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000). He is characterized as a spoiled, sadistic bully and is a frequent abuser of Sansa Stark, to whom he becomes engaged in the first novel, and his uncle Tyrion, whom he enjoys ridiculing.\n\nJoffrey is portrayed by Irish actor Jack Gleeson in the HBO television adaptation, a role for which he has received significant critical attention and praise.\n\nJoffrey Baratheon is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as his uncle Tyrion Lannister and his one-time fiancée Sansa Stark. He inherits his mother's traditional Lannister looks, and has blond hair and green eyes, and is believed by many to be very handsome.\n\nIn public, Joffrey is allegedly the oldest son and heir of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, both of whom entered into a political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the \"Mad King\" Aerys II Targaryen. In reality, his biological father is his mother's twin brother, Jaime Lannister. He has a younger sister, Myrcella, and a younger brother, Tommen, both of whom are also products of Jaime and Cersei's incestuous relationship. Their sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.\n\nJoffrey is an amoral sadist who disguises his cruelty with a thin veneer of charm. This is best epitomized by his response when his (then) betrothed offends him: Joffrey pronounces that his mother had taught him never to strike a woman, and so commissions a knight of the Kingsguard to hit her instead. He enjoys forcing people to fight to the death, and enforces cruel punishments for lesser crimes. He has no sense of personal responsibility, blaming failures on others. He lacks self-control and often insults his allies and family members. He is noticeably unintelligent and impulsive, which frequently leads him to make irrational decisions. He appears to have virtually no interests other than sadism and extreme violence, paying no attention to actually governing his kingdom or to anything involving sex even when he is offered exceptionally beautiful women.\n\nJoffrey is 12 years old at the beginning of \"A Game of Thrones\" (1996).\n\nPrince Joffrey is taken by his parents to Winterfell and is betrothed to Sansa Stark in order to create an alliance between House Baratheon and House Stark. At first, Joffrey is kind and polite to Sansa. However, he refuses to show sympathy with the family when Bran Stark falls from a tower, until physically forced to by his uncle, Tyrion Lannister. While on the Kingsroad to King's Landing, Joffrey and Sansa come across Arya Stark practicing swordplay with a commoner Mycah. Joffrey accuses Mycah of assaulting a noble girl and makes a cut on his face with a sword. This causes Arya to hit Joffrey, allowing Mycah to escape. When Joffrey then turns on Arya, her direwolf Nymeria attacks Joffrey, injuring him. Later, Joffrey lies about the attack, saying it was unprovoked and demands Nymeria to be killed; however, Sansa's direwolf Lady is killed instead. He later has his bodyguard Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane hunt down and kill Mycah.\n\nLater, Eddard Stark discovers that Joffrey is not King Robert's biological son and refuses to acknowledge Joffrey's claim to the throne when King Robert dies. He is taken into custody. On Sansa's pleas, Eddard issues a false confession of his treason. Joffrey promised Sansa that he would be merciful but then beheads Eddard anyway and later forces Sansa to look upon her father's head.\n\nJoffrey is briefly seen in \"A Clash of Kings\" (1998). He rules with whim and caprice, proving difficult for even his mother to control. Sansa becomes imprisoned to his will, and he frequently has his guards beat her when she displeases him. When Stannis Baratheon attacks King's Landing, Joffrey leaves the battlefield, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion's use of wildfire and his grandfather Tywin's last-minute counterattack aided by the forces of House Tyrell.\n\nJoffrey sets aside his earlier betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell, cementing an alliance between the Lannisters and House Tyrell. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later after the events of the \"Red Wedding\", Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother's head. His uncle Tyrion and his grandfather Tywin are outraged and the former threatens Joffrey once again. After another disagreement, Tywin sends Joffrey to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin. During his wedding feast, he repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, presenting an offensive play about \"The War of the Five Kings\", with each of the kings played by dwarves to humiliate his uncle, whom he also forces to act as his cupbearer. At the conclusion of the dinner, however, Joffrey dies from poisoned wine. Tyrion is falsely accused and arrested by Cersei in \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000) but it is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators.\n\nJoffrey is mentioned a few times in the later novels.\n\nAfter Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey King, and his mother uses him as a puppet. A cruel ruler, Joffrey makes a mistake when, against Cersei's and Sansa's wishes, he refuses to honor his promise to spare Ned Stark; instead, Joffrey has him executed.\n\nJoffrey's act worsens the situation with the Lannisters' war effort, as his uncle Jaime is captured by the Starks, and Joffrey's paternal uncles Renly and Stannis challenge his claim to the Iron Throne. Joffrey frequently orders his Kingsguard to beat Sansa. His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing; consequently, he is almost killed during a riot. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, aided by the forces of House Tyrell. To cement the alliance between those families, Joffrey's engagement to Sansa is annulled so he can marry Margaery Tyrell.\n\nThe marriage is yet to take place, and rifts are growing between Joffrey, and his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, who are (in their respective ways) rebutting his cruelty. Joffrey also seems to take little interest in his betrothed, but is amazed and altered by her ways of winning the people's favor, in which he takes part. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after Joffrey commands him to consummate the marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that Tyrion was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later, after the events of the \"Red Wedding\", Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother Robb's head. Tyrion and Tywin are outraged, and the former threatens Joffrey once again. After another disagreement, Tywin sends Joffrey to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin.\n\nJoffrey finally marries Margaery. During his wedding feast, he repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, presenting an offensive play about \"The War of the Five Kings\", with each of the kings played by dwarves to humiliate his uncle, whom he also forces to act as his cupbearer. At the height of the festivities, Joffrey is suddenly overcome by poison and dies. His last act is an attempt to point at Tyrion, and as a result Tyrion is falsely accused and ordered arrested by Cersei, but it is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators. Olenna Tyrell, Margaery's grandmother, later confides to Margaery that she would never have let her marry \"that beast\". Following Joffrey's funeral, his younger brother and heir, Tommen, is crowned King and proceeds to marry Joffrey's widow Margaery.\n\nIn January 2007, HBO secured the rights to adapt Martin's series for television. Years later young actor Jack Gleeson was cast as Joffrey Baratheon.\nJack Gleeson received critical acclaim for his role as Joffrey Baratheon in the television series. In 2016, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the character #4 in their list of the \"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\". Author Martin described Joffrey as similar to \"five or six people that I went to school with ... a classic bully ... incredibly spoiled\".\n"}
{"id": "1888703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888703", "title": "Pre-School (South Park)", "text": "Pre-School (South Park)\n\n\"Pre-School\" is the tenth episode in the eighth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 121st episode overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 10, 2004. In the episode, the boys' arch-enemy from preschool Trent Boyett is released from juvenile hall and seeks revenge after taking the blame for starting a fire that permanently disfigured their pre-school teacher. Several plot elements reference the 1991 film \"Cape Fear\" as well as the \"\" episode \"\".\n\nA horrified Stan announces to Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters that Trent Boyett, a notorious bully from their preschool years, is being released from juvenile hall after a five-year sentence. In a flashback set five years previously, the boys play \"fireman\", a game in which they put out a fire by urinating on it. Wanting to put out an actual fire, they ask Trent to start one. However, the fire soon gets out of control and their teacher, Miss Claridge, is badly burned. Instead of going the easier way by saying that the fire was an accident, explaining how Miss Claridge got injured, and risking getting into trouble, the four boys immediately place the sole blame on Trent. Trent attempts to have Butters defend him, but Butters refuses to say what really happened out of fear of getting in trouble with his parents. Trent is sentenced to juvenile hall.\n\nNow that Trent is free, he seeks revenge. For knowing of Trent's innocence, but not defending him, Butters ends up in the hospital after sustaining a number of childhood pranks. The boys know that this is Trent's way of sending a warning to them and ask the sixth-graders for protection from him, which they will give them in exchange for a photo of Stan's mother's breasts (which are actually Cartman's buttocks with nipples drawn on with a black Sharpie, using Madonna’s book SEX as a guide). After Trent dispatches all of the sixth-graders, sending them to the hospital, the boys ask Stan's sister, Shelley, to defend them. She softens her usually-mean stance against them when she sees how truly terrified of Trent her brother is, but she only agrees to help them on the condition that they confess to Miss Claridge what really happened five years ago.\n\nThe boys meet Miss Claridge, who now must use a futuristic machine to get around and beep a single light on it one time to say yes and two times to say no, and attempt to confess about what happened five years ago, but Trent arrives to confront them before they can. Cartman takes out his mother's taser and fires it at Trent. But the electrodes land on Miss Claridge's electoral chair instead, causing it to crash into a propane shop, creating an explosion that destroys the shop and sets Miss Claridge on fire and crashes into a pet shop. The police arrive and ask Miss Claridge if Trent caused this. She replies \"no\" with two beeps, but the police misinterpret the two beeps to mean \"yes, yes\" and arrest Trent. The boys, having learned nothing from the experience, make the same mistake they made five years earlier, claiming that they were not involved with the incident at all. Trent is taken away, with Cartman taunting him with his buttocks. However, the sixth-graders, having been newly released from the hospital, come upon Cartman and see the \"breasts\" on his buttocks while he is mocking Trent. They mistake his rear end for actual breasts and carry him off to pleasure themselves to the very sight of them, with Cartman interjecting in slight panic.\n\nThe plot is based on the 1991 film \"Cape Fear\". Miss Claridge's motorized wheelchair is based on Christopher Pike's from \"\". The boys as pre-schoolers were voiced by actual children. The children's censored swearing are not actual swear words but were instead words like \"big dumby\". The episode started as an idea for a spin-off titled \"South Park Kids\".\n\n\"Pre-School\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.\n\n"}

Shock advertising is designed principally to break through the advertising “clutter” to capture attention and create buzz, and also to attract an audience to a certain brand or bring awareness to a certain public service issue, health issue, or cause (e.g., urging drivers to use their seatbelts, promoting STD prevention, bringing awareness of racism and other injustices, or discouraging smoking among teens).\n\nThe Benetton Group has come under particular scrutiny for the use of shock advertisements in its campaigns, leading to public outrage and consumer complaints. However, several of Benetton’s advertisements have also been the subject of much praise for heightening awareness of significant social issues and for “taking a stand” against infringements on human rights, civil liberties, and environmental rights.\n\nOther shocking advertisements released by Benetton include an image of a duck covered in oil (addressing issues of oil spillage and the cleanliness of oceans), a man dying of AIDS, a soldier holding a human bone, as well as a newborn infant still attached to its umbilical cord, which \"was intended as an anthem to life, but was one of the most censured visuals in the history of Benetton ads.\" Oliviero Toscani, a photographer for Benetton who contributed to many of its shocking advertisements, said, regarding the advertisement he created of a man dying from AIDS, that he wanted \"to use the forum of poster advertising to make people aware of this [AIDS] tragedy at a time when no-one dared to show AIDS patients.\"\n\nShock rock is a wide umbrella term for artists who combine rock music with elements of theatrical shock value in live performances.\n\nScreamin' Jay Hawkins was arguably the first shock rocker. After the success of his 1957 hit \"I Put a Spell on You\", Hawkins began to perform a recurring stunt at many of his live shows: he would emerge from a coffin, sing into a skull-shaped microphone and set off smoke bombs. Other acts include Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper, Rammstein, Iggy Pop, Kiss, W.A.S.P, GWAR, Twisted Sister, GG Allin, Christian Death, Slipknot, and the Misfits.\n\nShock value is also big in Hip hop music, and sometimes under the genre of horrorcore. One notable artist is Eminem, a controversial rapper, with his lyrics using the word \"faggot\" and songs about murdering his wife, rape, and the use of drugs.\n\nShock value is also used in the art world either by commenting on real world situations or expressing oneself (ranging from \"Piss Christ\"to the 2002 Gasper Noe art film \"Irréversible\") to the point of criticism and controversy.\n\n"}
{"id": "1888711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888711", "title": "Renly Baratheon", "text": "Renly Baratheon\n\nRenly Baratheon is a fictional character in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIntroduced in 1996's \"A Game of Thrones\", Renly is the youngest of the three sons of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont, and the younger brother of Robert and Stannis Baratheon. He is Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. He served as master of laws in his eldest brother's small council, before crowning himself king in the wake of Robert's death with the support of the Reach and the Stormlands, an act that helps kick off the War of Five Kings. This brings him into conflict with his older brother Stannis, whose claim is greater.\n\nRenly's homosexual relationship with Loras Tyrell is alluded to in the books and is made clearly evident in the television show. Both men are among Martin's most prominent LGBTQ characters, although Renly and Loras' adapted relationship and the show's portrayal of the latter has received mixed criticism.\n\nRenly Baratheon is portrayed by Gethin Anthony in the HBO television adaptation.\n\nRenly Baratheon is the younger brother of King Robert and of King Stannis. He is a handsome and charismatic man that wins friends easily, which makes him popular with the smallfolk. He is thought to look extremely similar to his older brother Robert, albeit smaller and slimmer, inheriting the Baratheon height and long black hair. Although he is well-liked and charismatic, many powerful lords at court secretly consider him to be vain and frivolous. He is described as disdainful of reading, although he enjoys hunting and jousting. Renly is also a closeted homosexual engaged in a relationship with Loras Tyrell.\n\nRenly is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Ned and Catelyn Stark. He is also often mentioned and remembered by Brienne of Tarth, who had fallen in love with him at a young age. Renly is mostly a background character in the novels.\n\nRenly Baratheon is the youngest of the Baratheon brothers and Lord of Storm's End. He is described as handsome and charismatic, winning friends easily. Renly serves on Robert's council as Master of Laws. After Robert dies, Renly declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms in \"A Clash of Kings\", wins the support of the Baratheon bannermen as he is their Lord Paramount, and seals an alliance with House Tyrell by marrying Margaery Tyrell. Before he can march on the capital though, he hears Stannis is besieging Storm's End. Renly marches there, intending to kill his brother in battle, and turning down an offer to become Stannis' heir. Before the battle he is assassinated by a shadow conjured by Melisandre, though it is unclear if Stannis is aware of this or not.\n\nRenly Baratheon is played by the British actor Gethin Anthony in the television adaption of the series of books.\n\nGethin Anthony on his character: \"The reason why I like playing him is I think he's a fantastic man who believes in Westeros being a cultured and enlightened place. His major advantage -- and why he gets on well in the world -- is that he gets on well with people.\"\n\nRenly Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, is the youngest brother of King Robert and Master of Laws in the Small Council. He is popular with the people because he is handsome, jovial, and throws extravagant balls and masquerades. He is not fond of fighting or bloodshed, and would rather make friends than kill enemies. He is secretly the lover of Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers, who convinces him that those qualities make him better ruling material than either of his older brothers. While Robert lies dying, Renly attempts to convince Ned of this, and that the two of them should kidnap Joffrey and rule the realm themselves. However, Ned refuses, so Renly, Loras, and their followers flee south. Once Joffrey becomes King and has Ned executed, Renly challenges his alleged nephew's claim to the throne.\n\nRenly declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms during Season 2 and wins the support of the Baratheon bannermen and the support of other houses, despite Stannis' better claim. He also seals an alliance with the powerful House Tyrell and its bannermen (including Randyll Tarly, father of Samwell Tarly) by marrying Margaery Tyrell. He leads his massive army slowly through southern Westeros, biding his time. Catelyn Stark tries to convince Renly and Stannis to put aside their differences and unite against the Lannisters but it fails as both brothers refuse to give their claim for the throne. On the night before a battle between his and Stannis' forces, Renly agrees to Catelyn to allow Robb Stark to keep the title \"King in the North\" and rule the North and Riverlands, but on the condition that he swear fealty to Renly as King on the Iron Throne. Before Catelyn can offer a real negotiation, Renly is assassinated by Melisandre, who gives birth to a shadow demon and sends it to kill Renly in order to remove him from Stannis' path. Stannis is initially unaware of the exact nature of Melisandre's crime, and is later visibly shocked and saddened of the role he played in his brother's death, which he visibly regrets.\n\nRenly is later avenged in the Season 5 finale when Brienne of Tarth executes his brother Stannis after the battle outside Winterfell against the Boltons, spitefully telling Stannis that Renly was the rightful King.\n"}
{"id": "1888712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888712", "title": "Stannis Baratheon", "text": "Stannis Baratheon\n\nStannis Baratheon is a fictional character in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\". He is the second son of Steffon Baratheon, the lord of Storm's End, and his wife Lady Cassana Estermont, and brother to King Robert and Renly. He is the Lord of Dragonstone and a claimant to the Iron Throne after his elder brother's death. Stannis's goals are frequently impeded by his lack of manpower and resources, owing to his unpopularity with other noble houses. He must therefore rely on the counsel of the foreign priestess Melisandre and his right-hand man, lowborn smuggler Davos Seaworth, who later becomes his Hand of the King. Stannis often struggles to escape the shadow of his two more overtly charismatic brothers, particularly Robert.\n\nThough first mentioned in 1996's \"A Game of Thrones\", Stannis formally appeared in \"A Clash of Kings\" (1998), \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000) and \"A Dance with Dragons\" (2011). In December 2011, Martin posted a sample chapter from the yet-unfinished \"The Winds of Winter\", told from Theon Greyjoy's viewpoint, which confirmed Stannis' return in the sixth book.\n\nStannis is portrayed by English actor Stephen Dillane in the HBO television adaptation of the series, who has received significant critical praise for his performance. Stannis is a divisive character among fans of the books and television show alike, enjoying both great popularity for his dedication to justice and dark horse status, as well as opposition for his unrelenting attitude towards the Iron Throne. He has earned particular attention for the differences in his characterization between the novels and show, particularly during season five.\n\nStannis Baratheon is the younger brother of King Robert and older brother of Renly. He is portrayed as a brooding and humorless man with a harsh but fair sense of duty and justice whose dour demeanor is often off-putting in comparison to his two more charismatic brothers. He is renowned as a skilled and prescient military commander. Although he is initially said to be extremely stubborn and inflexible, in later books he has shown some ability to use diplomacy and deception to achieve his goals.\n\nStannis was born as the second of Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont's three sons, and in his youth he was constantly overshadowed by his older brother Robert. When Stannis was fourteen he witnessed his parents' death in a shipwreck off the coast of House Baratheon's castle of Storm's End, and subsequently lost his faith in the Seven Gods.\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, a teenage Stannis holds Storm's End in Robert's absence, but is besieged by Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne for the best part of the year. Stannis' garrison only avoids starvation thanks to the smuggler Davos Seaworth, who evades the blockade by the Redwyne fleet to bring the Baratheon soldiers a cargo of onions and fish. When Eddard Stark arrives to lift the siege, Stannis knights Davos as reward for his aid, but also insists that Davos have four fingers removed as punishment for his years of illegal smuggling; Davos agrees, on the condition that Stannis removes the fingers himself. Stannis is subsequently tasked with building a new royal fleet to assault Dragonstone and capture the island, but arrives to find that Aerys II Targaryen's children Viserys and the newborn Daenerys had fled. Robert names Stannis Lord of Dragonstone, giving him control over the islands of Blackwater Bay and the nearby peninsula of Massey's Hook - but Stannis feels slighted, as their younger brother Renly is named Lord of Storm's End, giving him control over the entirety of the Stormlands. It is suggested that this was because Robert was following the custom of granting Dragonstone to the king's heir, but Stannis perceives it as an insult.\n\nSeveral years later, Stannis is married to Lady Selyse Florent, but Robert soiled their wedding bed by deflowering Selyse's cousin Delena, further insulting Stannis. Stannis and Selyse have a single daughter together, Shireen, who nearly dies in infancy after contracting greyscale and is left disfigured. Stannis, who is named Robert's Master of Ships, destroys the Iron Fleet under the command of Victarion Greyjoy at Fair Isle during the Greyjoy Rebellion and leads the conquest of Great Wyk, the largest of the Iron Islands, adding to his significant military resume.\n\nAt the beginning of the first novel \"A Game of Thrones\", Stannis comes to suspect that Robert's children with Cersei Lannister are not actually his, and reveals his suspicions to Robert's Hand of the King, Lord Jon Arryn. The two discover several of Robert's bastard children in King's Landing, and begin to gather proof, before Jon's sudden, untimely death.\n\nStannis is frequently described as a large and sinewy man that towers over others, such as Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow, a Baratheon trait. He lacks the long black hair of his brothers, and is instead balding, although he keeps a close-cropped beard of the signature Baratheon black. His face is described as 'tight like cured leather' with hollow, gaunt cheeks. His eyes are described by Asha Greyjoy as 'deep, sunken pits', with a powerful stare that suggests an 'iron ferocity'.\n\nStannis' most prominent characteristics are his flinty and austere demeanor, unrelenting stubbornness, and powerful sense of duty and justice, the latter of which he is notorious for throughout Westeros. He rarely forgives a slight; Jon Snow once comments that \"Stannis Baratheon with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone; he gnawed it down to splinters.\" His signature tic is grinding his teeth, often in the face of unpleasant or unforeseen circumstances. He is a renowned commander, sailor, and warrior, although he is a better tactician than fighter. Stannis is known for his brusqueness and lack of tact in social situations and finds himself uncomfortable around women, including his own wife. He abhors brothels and once tried to have them banned from King's Landing, which made him unpopular with the smallfolk there. He dresses plainly in dark clothing and is rarely seen without his sword and dagger. Stannis is plagued with bitterness at the lack of respect and affection he has been shown by his older brother King Robert, and even in childhood was described by the Baratheon family maester as \"the most unloved of the three\"; a \"solemn and joyless\" child \"mature beyond his years\". Stannis is an atheist, despite claims that he is being manipulated by the red priestess Melisandre.\n\nAlthough Stannis suffers from a lack of support and resources during the War of Five Kings, he is frequently described by his adversaries, including Tywin Lannister, as the most dangerous rival claimant. Above all he is characterized by his fearless and uncompromising pursuit of justice and duty - he is described by Varys in this way: \"His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man.\"\n\nStannis is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, predominantly Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow, and later Asha and Theon Greyjoy.\n\nWhen Robert travels to Winterfell to name Eddard as his new Hand, Stannis flees to Dragonstone with his forces, including most of the royal navy. Stannis suspects Cersei's involvement in Jon's death. It is later revealed that the true culprit was Jon's wife Lysa, who was persuaded to poison her husband by her lover, Petyr Baelish. Eddard continues Stannis and Jon's investigations, and discovers that Cersei's children are the products of her incestuous affair with her twin brother Jaime Lannister. After Robert's death, Eddard tries to replace Robert's presumed heir Joffrey Baratheon with Stannis, but loses the political struggle against the Lannisters and is executed.\n\nStannis comes under the influence of the red priestess Melisandre, who believes that Stannis is the reincarnation of Azor Ahai, a messianic figure in her faith. Stannis declares himself the one true King; however, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of his younger and much more charismatic brother, Renly, as does the powerful House Tyrell due to Renly's marriage to Margaery Tyrell. Stannis tries to negotiate with Renly, offering him the chance to become his heir, which offer Renly rejects, planning to have Stannis killed the next day. Renly is subsequently assassinated by a shadow conjured by Melisandre using Stannis' life force, and many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis, although the Tyrells side with the Lannisters due to their offer to have Margaery marry Joffrey.\n\nStannis assaults King's Landing by sea, but many of his men are killed when Tyrion Lannister detonates wildfire in the River Blackwater. Stannis' forces still nearly claim victory, but Lannister and Tyrell reinforcements arrive in time to drive Stannis' men away from King's Landing. However Rolland Storm, the Bastard of Nightsong, commands his forces well enough that Stannis is able to escape.\n\nStannis retreats to Dragonstone with what is left of his army. He imprisons his Hand Lord Alester Florent, one of his wife's uncles, for trying to offer terms of surrender to the Lannisters. Another of Selyses' uncles, Ser Axell Florent, castellan of Dragonstone, aims to become Stannis' Hand of the King. He suggests a plan to attack Claw Isle in retaliation for Lord Celtigar's bending the knee to Joffrey, but Davos derides an attack on this defenseless island as evil. For this honest counsel Stannis names Davos as his new Hand. Melisandre tells Stannis to burn Edric Storm, one of Robert's bastards, as a sacrifice to raise dragons from Dragonstone. Stannis is conflicted about burning his nephew but uses Edric's blood collected by three leeches to curse the rival kings: Balon Greyjoy, Joffrey Baratheon, and Robb Stark. After Joffrey's, Balon's, and Robb's deaths seem to prove the power of king's blood, Stannis considers sacrificing Edric. Davos smuggles Edric off Dragonstone to the Free Cities, and then persuades Stannis to sail to the North and save the Night's Watch from the wildling army. After Melisandre burns Alester Florent as a sacrifice to R'hllor to ensure favorable winds, Stannis takes most of his remaining army and sails north to crush the wildling assault, managing to rout the whole host with few casualties. He remains at the Night's Watch headquarters at Castle Black to negotiate a settlement with the wildlings, and offers to legitimise Eddard's bastard Jon Snow if Jon will fight with Stannis' army. Jon, who has been elected Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, declines, as he has made an oath binding him to serve the Night's Watch.\n\nStannis sends ravens to the Northern houses naming himself as king and asking for their support, but only House Karstark and a faction of House Umber swear allegiance. Stannis has the King-beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder burned at the stake, and most of the wildlings bend the knee to Stannis, although Stannis is unaware that Melisandre had used glamours to switch Rayder and his lieutenant, the Lord of Bones. To rally the North, Stannis intends to attack House Bolton's castle The Dreadfort with the help of Arnolf Karstark, castellan of Karhold. In reality Arnolf is working with the Boltons, hoping to entrap Stannis and have his hostage great-nephew Harrion Karstark executed so his branch of the family can take Karhold. On Jon's advice, Stannis instead rallies the northern mountain clans and attacks Deepwood Motte, ousting the Ironborn holding the castle and taking Asha Greyjoy captive. He restores the castle to House Glover, thus winning their support and that of House Mormont. He marches on Winterfell to confront the Boltons, joined by the men of Arnolf Karstark and Mors Umber (one of the castellans of the Last Hearth), but his host is waylaid by heavy snows and forced to stop at a crofter's village three days away from Winterfell. A letter is later sent to Jon Snow by Ramsay Bolton claiming that Stannis has been defeated and killed, though it is unknown how much of the letter is true. George R. R. Martin confirmed to a fan in 2015 that Stannis is still alive in the books.\n\nIn December 2011, Martin posted a sample chapter from the yet-unfinished sixth book \"The Winds of Winter\", told from Theon Greyjoy's viewpoint, where Stannis is actively and efficiently preparing for the looming battle against the Bolton-Frey-Karstark alliance. He secures a loan by signing a blood contract with the Braavosi banker Tycho Nestoris, whose convoy managed to find Stannis' army, and plans to immediately send Tycho back to the Wall for safety. Tycho also brought a message from Jon Snow informing Stannis of Arnolf Karstark's planned treachery, after which Stannis arrested Arnolf, his son Arthor and his three grandsons and plans to execute them. He also subdued Tybald, the Dreadfort maester, who out of fear confesses that he has already revealed Stannis's position to the Boltons in Winterfell.\n\nStannis then sends Ser Justin Massey to escort Tycho and the escaped \"Arya Stark\" back to Castle Black to reunite her with Jon Snow, in gratitude for Jon's counsel of gathering the northern mountain clans. Massey is to then travel to Braavos and use a loan from the Iron Bank to hire twenty thousand sellswords for Stannis. Stannis tells Massey that he may hear of Stannis's death in Braavos, but even if that news is true, Massey is to follow the orders as to seat his daughter Shireen on the Iron Throne.\n\nStannis then interrogates Theon for information regarding the Boltons' military strength. When Theon taunts Stannis for not taking Ramsay seriously, Stannis confidently reveals that he already has a battle plan to utilize the terrain against the incoming Frey army. Stannis next receives Asha Greyjoy, and informs her that her brother Theon must be executed, as showing him mercy would mean losing all of the northmen. To spare Theon the agony of death by burning, Asha pleas Stannis to personally execute Theon by beheading in the tradition of the northmen.\n\nStannis Baratheon is played by Stephen Dillane in the television adaption of the series of books.\n\nStannis falls under the influence of Melisandre, a priestess of R'hllor who believes Stannis is the reincarnation of a legendary hero from her religion. After Robert's death, Stannis claims himself the true heir to the Iron Throne as Cersei's children are bastards born of incest. However, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of the younger but far more charismatic Renly. Stannis confronts Renly and offers to make him his heir if he supports him, but Renly refuses, only using the negotiations as an opportunity to mock his brother, and intending to kill Stannis in battle the next day. Melisandre, who had seduced Stannis, gives birth to a shadow baby bearing Stannis' face that kills Renly, and many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis. He then attacks King's Landing by sailing up Blackwater Bay. Stannis' force breaches the walls, but due to Tyrion Lannister's use of wildfire and the arrival of last-minute Lannister and Tyrell reinforcements, he is defeated. Nonetheless, he is convinced to continue fighting by Melisandre, and is further convinced by her magic as she shows him a vision of a battle in the flames.\n\nStannis acquires one of Robert's bastards, Gendry, from the Brotherhood Without Banners and plans to sacrifice him to further his quest for the Iron Throne. After Davos Seaworth questions his course of action, Stannis has three leeches drawn with Gendry's blood and throws them into a fire, calling for the death of Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy and Joffrey Baratheon. Upon the news of Robb's death, Davos releases Gendry to prevent him from being sacrificed. Stannis subsequently sentences Davos to death but is swayed by Melisandre, who encourages him to travel North to aid the Night's Watch against the White Walkers emerging from beyond the Wall.\n\nStannis hears of Joffrey's death and chastises Davos again for releasing Gendry and not finding him a suitable army, prompting Davos to write to the Iron Bank of Braavos in Stannis' name to help pay for an army. The Iron Bank nearly refuses Stannis' request, but Davos manages to convince them that Stannis is the only one they can turn to since Tywin Lannister is nearing old age. Stannis and his army arrive at the Wall shortly after the Battle of Castle Black, interrupting a parley between Jon Snow and Mance Rayder and crushing the wildling force. Stannis learns that Jon is Ned Stark's son, and on Jon's advice, he places Mance and his men under arrest. He is later present at the funeral of the Night's Watch brothers who died during the Battle for Castle Black.\n\nStannis begins plans to retake the North from Roose Bolton, hoping to recruit Mance's wildling army, if Mance will bend the knee to him. Mance refuses, and Stannis has him burnt at the stake. Stannis offers to legitimise Jon as a Stark to win the loyalty of the Northerners who refuse to recognise Stannis as their king, but Jon decides to remain loyal to his vows to the Night's Watch. Stannis marches on Winterfell, but his army is delayed by a large snowstorm. In the chaos Ramsay Bolton and his men infiltrate Stannis's camp, and destroy all supplies and horses. Melisandre persuades a profoundly reluctant Stannis to sacrifice Shireen to ensure victory. Although the act seems to lift the snowstorm, Stannis is visibly mentally broken, and the next day half of Stannis's army deserts him, Selyse commits suicide out of guilt, and Melisandre flees to Castle Black. Stannis decides to complete the march on foot. As his army arrives at Winterfell, it is swiftly defeated by a cavalry charge led by Ramsay Bolton. Surviving the battle, Stannis fends off Bolton soldiers in a nearby forest but is severly wounded and, at a point of utter despondency, confronted by Brienne of Tarth, former member of Renly's Kingsguard. Stannis confesses to killing his brother with blood magic and finally accepts responsibly, telling to \"do [her] duty\", whereupon she beheads him with a single stroke from Oathkeeper. Brienne enunciates she is executing him in the name of the 'rightful' King Renly, her slain love.\n\nThe English actor Stephen Dillane has received positive reviews for his performance as Stannis Baratheon, especially in the fifth season. On her review for \"Sons of the Harpy\", Sarah Hughes of \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"Stephen Dillane has always been wonderful at showing us the core of this rigid, complex man.\" His performance on the same episode also received positive reviews from \"Vulture\".\n\nHarri Sargeant of \"Hypable\" wrote, \"Stephen Dillane has always been one of the classiest actors on the show, and his last moments as the King Who Almost Was saw as commanding a performance as ever.\"\nIn her review for \"Mother's Mercy\", Meghan O'Keefe of \"Decider\" wrote, \"Whether you like Stannis or not, you have to admit that Stephen Dillane delivered a monumental performance this season.\"\n\nCindy Davis of \"Pajiba\" wrote \"After Shireen’s seemingly pointless death, it’s a testament to Stephen Dillane’s phenomenal skills that we could feel anything at all for a man who watched his daughter burned alive.\"\nNick Steinberg of \"Goliath\" wrote, \"Credit has to go to Stephen Dillane for his performance, especially in these last few episodes where he’s had to convey a form of grim tragedy that’s effectively conveyed the character’s downfall.<nowiki></nowiki> For his part, Dillane expressed misgivings about his performance, telling \"The Times\" newspaper, \"I didn’t know what I was doing until we’d finished filming and it was too late. The damage had been done. I thought no one would believe in me and I was rather disheartened by the end. I felt I’d built the castle on non-existent foundations.”\"\n"}

The magi travelling from the east have arrived at the court of King Herod in Jerusalem and in this verse inform him of their purpose.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nThe New International Version Copyright 2011, translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:2.\n\nThe theme of World Youth Day 2005, \"\"We have come to worship Him\"\", is derived from this verse in the bible.\n\nBoring notes that \"where\" is the first word spoken aloud in the Gospel. \"Where\" will also be the first word spoken by Herod in . Throughout the early part of the gospel geography will be a central concern of Matthew, covered in far greater detail than in the other gospels. One theory is that Matthew is writing an apologetic for why the messiah comes from the small and unknown town in Nazareth in Gentile dominated Galilee. This is the only time in the chapter that Magi speak. Davies and Allison believe their general silence throughout the narrative helps maintain the travellers aura of mystery.\n\nAlbright and Mann mention but reject the theory that King of the Jews is an anachronism and at the time King of Israel or King of the Hebrews would have been a more likely title. They reject this theory saying that King Aristobulus used the title around 100 BC. Nolland notes that this inaccuracy might be reflective of the foreign nature of the Magi, who do not know the specific terminology to be used. The title is reused by a less knowledgeable foreigner in . The title is a direct challenge to Herod, who was renowned for his paranoia, as king of Judea. Herod as an Edomite would have been especially threatened by a Davidic heir.\n\nThe word \"worship\", also often translated as \"pay homage\", \"proskunesai\" in the Greek, is a very popular one in Matthew. It can mean honouring either a king or a God, in this case which of the meanings is meant is not clear.\n\nThe star referenced in this verse has come to be known as the Star of Bethlehem. Since at least Kepler there has been much work to try and link it to an astronomical event with the most common cited being a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BC. Since 1964 the astronomer Konradin Ferrari d'Occhieppo argued in several publications for this very seldom conjunction as having taken place in the year 7 BC. The phrase \"seen his star in the east\" is much disputed. Many scholars feel it should actually just read \"seen his star rising\". The Greek word in question is \"anatole\", but its exact translation is unclear. It is likely a technical astrological term meaning rising. Its spelling is very close to the word for east, and this has become the standard translation. Fortna notes that it seems contradictory because a star rising to the east would then guide the magi westwards. Boring suggests that the verse could be read as the magi seeing the star rising when they were in the east.\n\nJohn Chrysostom rejected the idea that the Star of Bethlehem was a normal star or similar heavenly body because such a star could not have specified the exact cave and manger where Jesus was found, being too high in the sky to be that specific. Also, he notes that stars in the sky move from east to west, but that the magi would have traveled from north to south to arrive in Palestine from Persia. Instead, Chrysostom suggested that the Star was a more miraculous occurrence, comparable to the pillar of cloud that led the Israelites out of Egypt through the wilderness.\n\nAt the time the notion of new stars as beacons of major events were common, being reported for such figures as Alexander the Great, Mithridates VI of Pontus, Abraham, and Augustus. Pliny even takes time to rebut a theory that every person has a star that rises when they are born and fades when they die, evidence that this was believed by some. According to Brown many at the time would have thought it unthinkable that a messiah would have been born without such stellar portents.\n\nThe reference to the star makes it likely the magi were astrologers. Some Christians have had difficulty with this as elsewhere in the Bible astrology is condemned, a view shared by most Christian churches. France argues that the passage is not an endorsement of astrology but rather an illustration of how God takes care in \"meeting individuals where they are\". Keener notes that astrology was ubiquitous in the Roman world of this period, and was also common among the Jews in Palestine. Matthew goes in no detail about the astrological nature of the magi and makes no judgments either for or against the practice. Nolland states \"the interest is elsewhere\" and the author of Matthew has no inclination to go into a detailed discussion of astrology.\n"}

{"id": "1888720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888720", "title": "The Siege of Numantia", "text": "The Siege of Numantia\n\nThe Siege of Numantia () is a tragedy by Miguel de Cervantes set at the siege of Numantia, captured and razed by Scipio Aemilianus in 133 BC. \n\nThe play is divided into four acts, (\"jornadas\", or \"days\"). The dialogue is sometimes in tercets and sometimes in \"redondillas\", but for the most part in octaves. The work was composed \"circa\" 1582 and was apparently very successful in the years before the advent of the playwright Lope de Vega. It remained unpublished until the eighteenth-century. Since then, it has been hailed by many as a “rare specimen of Spanish tragedy” and even as the best Spanish tragedy not only from the period before Lope de Vega, but of all its literature. Some critics have seen resemblances between Cervantes' tragedy and Aeschylus's \"The Persians\", while others reject that the play is a conventional tragedy. Some envision the play as containing epic elements or even exhibiting opposing epics: Virgil's \"Aeneid\" and Lucan's \"Pharsalia\", while Barbara Simerka argues for generic instability and the counter-epic\n\nIn the first act, Scipio appears with his generals in the Roman camp before Numantia. He explains that this war has been going on for many years and that the Roman Senate has sent him to finish the task. He reprimands his troops, whose martial spirit has begun to be superseded by the pleasures of Venus and Bacchus. The soldiers are re-inspired with courage. Numantian ambassadors enter with proposals for peace, which are rejected. The Greek Chorus, in Cervantes' work is replaced by allegorical figures. Spain appears, and she summons the river Duero, on whose banks Numantia stands. The old river god appears, attended by a retinue of the deities of the smaller rivers of the surrounding country. These allegorical characters consult fate, in the guise of Proteus and discover that Numantia cannot be saved. The lengthy speech dealing with Spanish history has been taken as a moment of praise for the future Spanish empire, and as containing elements that question imperial expansionism.\n\nIn Act Two, the scene is now transferred to Numantia. The senate is assembled to deliberate on the affairs of the city. The senate adopts bold resolutions. The story moves into light redondillas - the loves of a young Numantian, named Marandro for Lira. Although Venus is invoked, Marandro assures his friend Leoncio that true love (as opposed to Roman lust) does not impede his duties as citizen and soldier. A solemn sacrifice is prepared; but amidst the ceremony an evil spirit appears, seizes the victim, and extinguishes the fire. The confusion in the town increases. A dead man is resuscitated by magic in a dramatic scene reminiscent of the necromantic revivification by the witch Erichto in the Pharsalia.\n\nIn the third act, all hope for a successful resolution of the dispute between Romans and Numantians has now vanished. While the men would go out and fight the Romans in the field rather than die of hunger in the siege, the women of the play prevent them from doing this. It is they who recommend a mass suicide, for, in this manner, they will not become enslaved to the Romans. It is the women, then, who impel Theagenes to carry out this fatal action, thus playing a key role in the tragic denouement. The city resolves to burn all their valuable property, to put their wives and children to death, and to throw themselves into the flames, lest any of the inhabitants of the town should become the slaves of the Romans. Scenes of domestic misery and of patriotism ensue. Famine rages in Numantia. Marandro, accompanied by his friend, Leoncio, ventures to enter the Roman camp. \n\nThe tragic denouement ensues in Act Four. Here, Marandro returns with some bread smeared with blood in order to feed Lira, but he falls at her feet mortally wounded, foregrounding the theme of sacrifice. Scenes of destruction and mass suicide ensue, as men kill their women and then turn the sword on themselves or duel with each other. The allegorical figures of War, Sickness and Hunger take over the stage in an apocalyptic ambiance. When Bariato, the last youth left alive, commits suicide by throwing himself from a tower, the Roman general realizes that he cannot go home with slaves and spoil, and that the small city of Numantia has triumphed over the power of the Romans. His lament signals for some critics the final catastrophe and his role as tragic hero. His hubris and desire for domination rather than negotiation has brought him to his knees. The allegorical figure of Fame enters at the end of the piece, and announces the future glory of Spain, a great power that will rise out of the ashes of Numantia like the phoenix.\n"}

{"id": "1888736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888736", "title": "French bicycle industry", "text": "French bicycle industry\n\nThe French bicycle industry and the history of the bicycle are intertwined. Spanning the last century and a half, the industry has seen two booms, and continues into the 21st century, albeit less dominant today.\n\nTo most the invention of the bicycle was by the German Baron Karl von Drais, who rode his 1816 machine while collecting taxes from his tenants. He patented his \"draisine\" (or \"draisienne\"), a \"pushbike\" powered by the action of the rider's feet pushing against the ground.\n\nReports of early forebears of the bicycle were \"velocipedes\", and included many human-powered vehicles. One, the scooter-like \"dandy horse\" or \"celerifere\" of the French Comte de Sivrac, dating to 1790, was long cited as the earliest bicycle, however, most historians now believe these unsteerable hobby-horses probably never existed, but were made up by Louis Baudry de Saunier, a 19th-century French bicycle historian.\n\nIn the 1860s, the Michaux family, Parisian coach builders, developed a new drive mechanism, placing pedals and cranks on an enlarged wooden front wheel with iron tires, which was mounted on a heavy steel frame. The credit for their innovative crank and pedals remains in dispute. Pierre Lallement, a \"Michaux\" mechanic, claimed to have collaborated with Ernest Michaux, while Henry Michaux told in March 1893 in the newspaper \"L'Éclair\" how his brother Ernest, together with their father Pierre have developed the idea in 1861 after modifying a draisine brought for repairs. The design was an adaptation of the crank-handles the two inventors had seen on a grinding wheel. In any event, Pierre Michaux's factory started producing crank-and-pedal driven velocipedes : two the first year, 142 the following year.\n\nPerhaps owing to dispute over the invention, in 1865 Lallement emigrated to America, where, with the financial backing of James Carroll of Ansonia, Connecticut, he recorded the first U.S. patent on a bicycle, in 1866. Meanwhile, by 1865, the Michaux family was manufacturing 400 velocipedes annually; their bicycles were on display at the first international bicycle exhibition in 1867, and by 1869, the Michaux factory, with a daily production of 200, began selling in the United States. Their wood and iron construction earned these velocipedes the sobriquet \"Boneshakers\". The first boneshaker race was in 1868, in Paris' Parc de Saint Cloud; the winner was James Moore, a friend of the Michaux family. Moore also won the 123 km Paris–Rouen race in 1869, finishing in 10 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nHowever, tensions between France and Prussia building since the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 erupted into the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and production of bicycles at Michaux was suspended to support the war effort. As a result, the next innovations occurred in Great Britain. Prior to the Franco-Prussian war, the Michaux family had reached an agreement with Rowley B. Turner of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company to manufacture 400 Michaux velocipedes to be sold in France. With the war, Turner arranged instead to sell them in England. James Starley, a foreman at Coventry, began to make improvements and in 1885, the Starley \"Rover\", a \"safety bicycle\" manufactured by Starley's nephew, John Kemp Starley, was the first recognisably modern bicycle.\n\nWhile the bicycle was popular among wealthy young men in cities such as London, New York City, and Paris, Starley's safety bicycle ushered in the \"\"golden age of bicycles.\"\" A bicycle craze swept Europe and North America during the Gay Nineties; suddenly, the bicycle was safe, affordable, and available for transport and leisure for the ordinary person. Although France was swept up in the craze, production remained centered in England and the United States. However, the seeds were sown for the rebirth of the French industry.\n\nIn 1881, Paul de Vivie, a man of twenty-eight, bought his first bicycle, an \"ordinary\". By 1887, de Vivie decided to devote his attention to his avocation; he sold his business, and moved to Saint-Étienne, where he opened a bicycle shop and started a magazine, \"Le Cycliste\". Velocio, as de Vivie was known, began to import bicycles from Coventry; within two years, however, he had begun to produce his own bicycles. His 1889 \"La Gauloise\" was the first bicycle produced in France.\n\nFrench bicycle manufacturers have included:\n\nFrench bicycle component manufacturers have included:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1888743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888743", "title": "Imperial County of Ortenburg", "text": "Imperial County of Ortenburg\n\nThe Imperial County of Ortenburg was a state of the Holy Roman Empire in present-day Lower Bavaria, Germany. It was located on the lands around Ortenburg Castle, about west of Passau. Though the Counts of Ortenburg - formerly \"Ortenberg\" - emerged in the 12th century as a cadet branch of the Rhenish House of Sponheim (Spanheim) who then ruled over the Duchy of Carinthia, an affiliation with the Carinthian Ortenburger comital family is unverifiable.\n\nThe first Count Rapoto I of Ortenburg was mentioned about 1134. Born at Kraiburg, the fourth son of Duke Engelbert II of Carinthia, he retained several Bavarian territories held by the Spanheimer family, while his elder brothers Ulric and Engelbert III succeeded their father in Carinthia and Istria. Rapoto had the Ortenburg Castle erected about 1120 whereafter he began to call himself a \"Graf von Ortenberg\". When his brother Engelbert III died without heirs in 1173 he could unite a significant number of territories under his rule and confirmed his independence when the Bavarian ducal title passed to the House of Wittelsbach in 1180. After Otto VIII of Wittelsbach had assassinated the German king Philip of Swabia in 1208, Rapoto's son Count Rapoto II even held the office of a Count Palatine of Bavaria.\n\nRapoto's II descendants however soon entered into fierce conflicts with the neighbouring Bishops of Passau and also with the mighty Austrian House of Babenberg. Upon the death of Count Rapoto III in 1248, his territories as well as the office of the Count Palatine again passed to the Wittelsbachs. The Ortenburg territory was further diminished by an ongoing inheritance conflict between Rapoto's III nephew Henry II and his brothers, of which the surviving Count Rapoto IV in 1275 could only retain the lands around Ortenburg Castle.\n\nUpon the death of Count Henry IV of Ortenburg in 1395, the county was partitioned into Ortenburg-Altortenburg, Ortenburg-Neuortenburg and Ortenburg-Dorfbach. The Neuortenburg branch again inherited the Altortenburg county in 1444 following the death of Etzel I and Dorfbach county in 1462 following the death of Count Alram II. Meanwhile, the county had fallen under the influence of the Wittelsbach Bavaria-Landshut duchy, and also sided with Duke Albert IV of Bavaria-Munich in the 1503 Landshut War of Succession. Since the dynasty of the Counts of Celje had become extinct with the death of Count Ulrich II in 1456, the Ortenburg counts had claimed the Carinthian \"Grafschaft Ortenburg\", but failed to prove any kinship apart from the name similarity.\nUnder Count Joachim of Ortenburg-Neuortenburg, the state turned to Protestantism in 1563, fiercely opposed by Duke Albert V of Bavaria challenging Ortenburg's Imperial immediacy which however was confirmed by the Imperial Chamber Court in 1573. The county remained a Lutheran enclave within the mainly Catholic Bavarian lands and became a refuge for expellees during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nThough deeply in debt after numerous lawsuits against the Wittelsbach dukes, Ortenburg-Neuortenburg retained its independence until in 1805 Count Joseph Charles Leopold finally sold it to Elector Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The county was incorporated into the newly established Kingdom of Bavaria in the course of the Empire's dissolution in 1806.\nIn exchange for his county, the count received the former monastery of Tambach (today part of Weitramsdorf) in Franconia in 1806, which was elevated to the status of \"Imperial County of Ortenburg-Tambach\", but shortly later became part of the Grand Duchy of Wurzburg by mediatisation, and in 1814 fell to the Kingdom of Bavaria. Since then the counts of Ortenburg belong to the Mediatized Houses. In 1827 count Joseph Carl bought his family's ancestral seat, Ortenburg Castle, back from the Bavarian Crown. Count Alram (1925–2007) however, who converted to the Roman Catholic Church, sold it in 1971. His son, count Heinrich (b. 1956), the former husband of Princess Désirée of Hohenzollern, owns Tambach Castle (the former monastery) and its vast estate to this day.\n\n\n\n"}

R. Martin and its television adaptation, \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nEllaria first appears in \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000), and while she is only mentioned in \"A Feast for Crows\" (2005), she returns in \"A Dance with Dragons\" (2011). She is the paramour to Oberyn Martell and mother to several of his bastard daughters, the Sand Snakes. After the death of her lover in a duel at the hands of Ser Gregor Clegane, she is sent into deep mourning, although her subsequent characterization differs between the novels and the television adaptation. In the novels, she sues for peace, seeking an end to the cycle of revenge. In the television adaptation, however, she is portrayed as ruthless and vengeful, willing to do anything to destroy House Lannister, even if it means killing Oberyn's own family in the process.\n\nThe character is portrayed by Indira Varma in the HBO television adaptation.\n\nEllaria Sand is a bastard from Dorne but is not discriminated against for this, as Dorne's views and customs towards children born out of wedlock differ from those of the rest of Westeros, where bastards are often discriminated against. She is the paramour of Oberyn Martell, as even in Dorne a Prince cannot marry a bastard. She is the mother of the youngest four Sand Snakes (Oberyn's bastard daughters). Like Oberyn, she is bisexual.\n\nIn the novels, Ellaria Sand is mostly a background character. She is not a point of view character; rather, her actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Tyrion Lannister, Arianne Martell, and Areo Hotah.\n\nEllaria comes with Oberyn to King's Landing, as part of Tyrion Lannister's efforts to win them to the Iron Throne. Oberyn, however, clearly wants revenge for his sister's death, apparently committed on the orders of Tywin Lannister, during King Robert's rebellion. Oberyn wants Ellaria to sit with him at Joffrey Baratheon's wedding, causing trouble when Olenna Tyrell calls her \"the serpent's whore\". Later, when Tyrion is condemned for poisoning Joffrey Baratheon, Oberyn acts as his champion in a Trial by Combat against Ser Gregor Clegane, who had raped and murdered Oberyn's sister, Elia Martell, during the Sack of King's Landing. Oberyn wounds Gregor with a poisoned spear but is killed by Gregor. Afterwards, Ellaria returns to Dorne.\n\nGregor Clegane apparently dies of the poison after spending days in agony (Oberyn having treated the poison to work slowly). His skull is sent to Dorne, where Oberyn's brother, Doran Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne, sees it. Despite Gregor and Tywin's deaths, Oberyn's bastard daughters want revenge. Ellaria argues against revenge, saying all those they want revenge against are dead and the Lannisters they are now targeting took no part in their kin's deaths. She reminds them Oberyn died trying to avenge his sister's death and worries they too will die, if they seek vengeance. Doran sends her back to her father, Lord Harmen Uller of Hellholt with her youngest daughter Loreza Sand.\n\nEllaria Sand is played by the British actress Indira Varma in the television adaption of the series of books. She won the Empire Hero Award along with the rest of the cast in 2015. She was also nominated, along with the rest of the cast for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2016.\n\nEllaria Sand's storyline in this season is very similar to her storyline in \"A Storm of Swords\".\n\nEllaria tries to persuade Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, to avenge his brother's death. However, Doran refuses, as Oberyn's death was via trial by combat, and therefore by Westerosi law, Gregor Clegane did not murder Oberyn. Ellaria soon learns that Jaime Lannister is sailing for Dorne, planning to rescue his daughter Myrcella, betrothed to Doran's son, Trystane. When Jaime arrives at the Water Gardens, the Sand Snakes attack him and Bronn, but the skirmish ends with all arrested by Martell guards. Doran and Jaime reach a deal, Trystane will marry Myrcella, but the two will live in King's Landing and Trystane will be granted a seat on the Small Council. Ellaria is threatened with death by Doran if she ever defies him and she feigns allegiance to him. She kisses Myrcella goodbye at the docks, secretly wearing lipstick coated with a slow-acting poison, which kills Myrcella on the ship headed for King's Landing.\n\nAfter Doran Martell realises that Myrcella has been murdered, Ellaria stabs Doran, while in King's Landing, Obara and Nymeria, who had snuck onto the ship headed to King's Landing, kill Trystane. This makes Ellaria the de facto ruler of Dorne. A while later, Ellaria meets Olenna Tyrell, whose son and grandchildren have been killed by Cersei, the present Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Ellaria then reveals that she has allied herself with Daenerys Targaryen after hearing that Yara and Theon Greyjoy have done the same. Later, Martell and Tyrell ships can be seen in Daenerys' fleet heading for Westeros.\n\nEllaria and the Sand Snakes arrive in Dragonstone to discuss the conquest of Westeros with Daenrys. Yara and Theon Greyjoy return Ellaria and the Sand Snakes to Dorne so they can gather their army. En route, Euron Greyjoy attacks them and burns Yara's fleet. He kills Obara and Nymeria and captures Yara, and takes Ellaria and Tyene to Cersei, as a gift.\n\nIn the dungeons Cersei recalls the death of Oberyn Martell and explains how much she loved Myrcella. Then she kisses Tyene using the same poison that Ellaria used to murder Myrcella. She tells Ellaria that she will be watching Tyene die and after Tyene's death, she will be kept alive to watch as her daughter's body rots away.\n"}

For the first two months of 1970, Donovan booked time at London's newly renovated Morgan Studios and began recording and producing the tracks that would form his next album. He made demos of around 20 new songs with just vocals and acoustic guitar, including solo versions of \"Changes\" and \"People Used To\", before assembling his new band. Dubbed \"Open Road\", the band was Donovan on guitar and harmonica, his frequent collaborator \"Candy\" John Carr on drums, and bassist/guitarist Mike Thompson who'd been a bandmate of Carr's in a group called Dada Lives and briefly in an early version of the band Amber. Donovan also hired engineers Robin Black and Mike Bobak, the latter of whom would work on several of Donovan's following albums. The sessions marked Donovan's first time playing electric guitar extensively in the studio, and he also took up producing the record himself. The trio were joined by former Nero and the Gladiators/Heads Hands & Feet keyboardist Mike O'Neill for some of the album's songs, and O'Neill stayed on to play a few gigs with Open Road.\n\nDonovan's intention was for Open Road to be the band he'd tour with indefinitely, primarily by sea on his own yacht. The plan was to leave Britain for one year, in part to avoid the exorbitant tax that the British government was levying on pop stars. The band met up on the Mediterranean isle of Crete to prepare the ship, rehearse material, and document their time there for the film \"There is an Ocean\", which went unreleased until 2005 when it surfaced as a DVD in the box set \"\".\n\nThe group ended up flying from Greece to France, to the Soviet Union, and then Japan, never fully embarking on their sea voyage. They also played a concert in Viareggio, Italy that was broadcast on Italian television. Donovan cut the tour short, returning to the UK to focus on his family and record his next album, 1971's \"H.M.S. Donovan\", on which John Carr and Mike Thompson also appeared. The last gig that Donovan did with Open Road was at the third annual Isle of Wight Festival on 30 August, 1970. Subsequently, Thompson and Carr continued to perform as Open Road, reassembling the group that same year with former Dada Lives bandmate Barry Husband on guitar and vocals, and church organist Simon Lanzon on keyboards. They recorded and released one more album, 1971's \"Windy Daze\", before disbanding.\n\nMany of the songs on \"Open Road\" ponder the negative side of industrialization and the lost peacefulness of a previous time. While Donovan had touched on this some of his previous work, \"Open Road\" was his first album to expound on the topic at length, though the versions recorded for the album scaled back on some of his more politically charged lyrics. The lyrics printed on the inner gatefold sleeve include some not sung on the actual record, like the first verse of \"Celtic Rock\":\n\n<poem>Ye sons of Britain\nWho once were free\nYe now are slaves to factory\nThose who walk the path of mole\nExpect in time to kill thy soul</poem>\n\nThe album's sole single, \"Riki Tiki Tavi\" (b/w \"Roots of Oak,\" also on the album), uses the mongoose from Rudyard Kipling's story in \"The Jungle Book\" as a metaphor for how people wait for institutions (\"i.e.: the church, i.e.: the government, i.e.: school\") to exterminate social ills. An earlier version of the song also preached abstinence from psychedelic drugs, stating, \"Laboratory synthetic stimuli, only goes to fog up your third eye.\" The song, \"Poke at the Pope\" decries religious faith, particularly Catholicism. \"Song for John\" was one of Donovan's epistles written for his friends, this one dedicated to fellow songwriter John Sebastian. \"New Year's Resovolution\" was inspired by Paul McCartney who, fresh from his break with The Beatles, was recording his first solo album in the studio below Donovan, as the two musicians saw themselves transitioning out of the 1960s and heading into new directions with their music. McCartney also loaned Donovan a guitar for some of the recording of \"Open Road\".\n\nIn addition to his mix of folk and rock, Donovan and his band explored a number of musical styles on the album. \"Riki Tiki Tavi\" takes Kipling's Indian setting and riffs it off of a reggae beat. Brazilian guitarist Carlos Jobim inspired the title of \"Joe Bean's Theme\", which alternates between a bossa nova rhythm and psychedelic pop melodies. And the album's allegorically fantasy-themed song \"Celtic Rock\" coined the name of a new musical subgenre.\n\n\"Open Road\" was released on vinyl LP in the US on Epic in July 1970, and then in the UK on Dawn Records in September. The album's cover features a photo, taken by Donovan's best friend \"Gypsy Dave\" Mills, of Donovan flanked by his two bandmates with their names typewritten in small print beneath each person. Some versions of the record featured neither Donovan's name nor the album title on the front, highlighting the name \"Open Road\" on the back, both as the album's title and as the name of the band featured on it. Other versions highlighted either \"Donovan\" or \"Open Road\" on the front.\n\n\"Open Road\" was Donovan's third-highest charting album in the U.S., reaching #17 within two weeks of its release and peaking at #16. In the U.K. the album reached #30.\n\nIn August 2000, the German label Repertoire Records reissued \"Open Road\" for the first time on CD.\n\nAll tracks by Donovan Leitch.\n\nSide One\n\nSide two\n\nRunning lengths for some tracks on the iTunes download album differ, mostly due to the removal of seaside sound effects at the end of several tracks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

R. Martin, and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nMargaery is first mentioned in \"A Game of Thrones\" (1996) and first appears in \"A Clash of Kings\" (1998). She is a member of the House Tyrell, the second wealthiest and largest of the eight Great Houses in Westeros. She is twin sister to Loras Tyrell and the granddaughter of Olenna Tyrell. She subsequently appeared in \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000), \"A Feast for Crows\" (2005), and \"A Dance with Dragons\" (2011). Like her grandmother, she is shrewd, ambitious and adaptable, and uses her beauty, generosity and family influence to secure power for herself. Having wed herself to three kings over the course of the narrative, she is one of the most influential political figures in Westeros, which often brings her into conflict with her chief rival at court, Cersei Lannister.\n\nMargaery is portrayed by English actress Natalie Dormer in the HBO television adaptation, a role for which she has received critical acclaim. Margaery is one of the most popular supporting characters in both the books and television show, and is often cited as a prominent example of the story's strong feminist themes.\n\nMargaery is the only daughter of Alerie Hightower and Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden in the Reach. Her older brothers are the heir Willas, Garlan and Loras the Knight of Flowers, who is a member of the Kingsguard. One of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Westeros, House Tyrell is actually guided by the willful Lady Olenna, Mace's mother, who has arranged Margaery's marriages and mentors her in politics and court intrigue. Margaery Tyrell is not a point of view character in the novels, so her actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of Sansa Stark and Cersei Lannister.\n\nMargaery appears in \"A Clash of Kings\" (1998), having married Renly Baratheon and supporting his claim to the Iron Throne. After Renly's assassination, the Tyrells switch allegiance and Margaery is instead offered to wed King Joffrey Baratheon. In \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000), she becomes popular among the citizens of King's Landing through her various charitable activities. Margaery forms an amiable relationship with the King's ex-fiancee Sansa Stark and through Sansa she learns much about Joffrey's true nature. Margaery weds Joffrey, but he is poisoned at their wedding feast. In \"A Feast for Crows\" (2005) Margaery marries Joffrey's younger brother, Tommen, and encourages him to assert himself as king. Margaery's growing influence over Tommen puts her in a bitter power struggle with his mother Cersei Lannister, which eventually culminates in Cersei framing Margaery for adultery. In \"A Dance with Dragons\" (2011), Margaery is released from prison and placed under house arrest, where she awaits trial.\n\nIn HBO's \"Game of Thrones\", Margaery's backstory and plotline in the early seasons remain largely unchanged from the novels, though the character is more prominent in the series and this version of Margaery is an adult as opposed to a teenager. Margaery first appears in the second season, following her marriage to Renly; she is well aware that her marriage is a political one, and displays pragmatism regarding Renly's homosexuality and his relationship with her brother Loras.\n\nMargaery, newly married to Renly, reveals that she is aware of his romantic relationship with her brother and is willing to work around his desires to secure their alliance and her position. Following Renly's assassination, Margaery indicates to Petyr Baelish that she is aware that her brother-in-law, Stannis Baratheon, is more likely to be behind the assassination than Brienne of Tarth, the official suspect. She also makes it clear that her ambition is to be the Queen of Westeros, and that she will not settle for anything less.\n\nMargaery has relocated to King's Landing and taken up residence in the Red Keep. She swiftly proves that she is one of the few people capable of managing Joffrey, which pleases his grandfather, Tywin Lannister, but makes her an enemy in Cersei. The series also expands on Margaery's friendship with Sansa Stark, though her motives are unclear and Margaery swiftly replaces Sansa as Joffrey's fiancee. Through several shrewd PR moves towards the city's poor and orphaned, Margaery becomes extremely popular with the common people as their future Queen.\n\nMargaery Tyrell has been married to Joffrey Baratheon, but she is widowed hours later when he is poisoned at the wedding feast. Soon after, Olenna reveals herself as masterminding the poisoning, but Margaery, now aware that Tyrion Lannister's trial is a farce, keeps quiet. Arrangements are made to wed Margaery to Joffrey's younger brother Tommen, to whom Margaery swiftly ingratiates herself. Cersei and Margaery continue their bitter rivalry; Cersei resents being displaced as Queen and being forced to marry her very young child to the much older Margaery, while Margaery tries to outmaneuver her.\n\nMargaery and Tommen marry, and she finally becomes the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. She taunts Cersei over her triumph, and exhorts Tommen to send Cersei away from the capital. Cersei, in a shortsighted attempt to get rid of her rival, consents for the Faith of the Seven to once again bear arms. Cersei intends for the zealously fervent religious order to seize and condemn Loras for his homosexual behavior, thus tricking Margaery into perjuring herself by denying knowledge of his proclivities. Margaery finds herself arrested and awaiting trial, although Cersei is arrested as well for her unrelated charges, ie. her incestuous behaviors.\n\nAfter a period of captivity, Margaery is permitted to visit Loras in his cell. She discovers that he is beginning to break under the Faith's questioning, and that the meeting is a ploy to break her too. Jaime Lannister leads the Tyrell army on the Sept of Baelor to secure Margaery's release, but it is revealed that she has been absolved, by convincing Tommen to forge an alliance between the Faith and the Crown. To placate Cersei, Margaery surreptitiously convinces Olenna to return to Highgarden, subtly indicating that she is still loyal to House Tyrell.\n\nMargaery persuades the High Sparrow, the leader of the Faith, to release Loras if he surrenders his claim as heir of House Tyrell and joins the Faith. However, when Cersei fails to arrive for her trial Margaery deduces Cersei is plotting something. Panicking, she desperately tries to convince the High Sparrow to evacuate the Sept of Baelor, but the High Sparrow refuses and has the Faith Militant bar the exits. Moments later, wildfire set beneath the Sept by Qyburn on Cersei's orders, is ignited causing the entire Sept and surrounds to be engulfed in flames. Margaery is killed instantly, along with hundreds of others present. Her death, and those of her brother and father, lead Olenna to accept a proposal by the Sand Snakes (who currently lead the Reach's ancient rival, Dorne) in supporting Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros.\n\nAdam Whitehead of the wertzone feels Margaery's rivalry with Cersei Lannister is a major driving force in \"A Feast for Crows\". Sean T. Collins writing for \"Rolling Stone\" feels that author Martin has been vague about Margaery's ambition and political cunning and describes her as a; \"mute mystery whose motives and level of involvement in the game of thrones are unknown [by \"A Clash of Kings\"]\" However other writers feel Margaery's political ambition is more obvious. Madeline of Feministing writes; \"Margaery is an ambitious politico as well as being a damn good actress – she plays the part of the tragic, virginal twice-widow so well that almost no one suspects that she is dead set on winning the throne. Despite frequently being used as a bartering chip, Margaery uses her womanhood to her advantage, knowing that producing an heir will shoot her to power.\" Similarly, Danica Liu writing for \"The Duke Chronicle\" describes Margaery as \"subtle and graceful\" and like most of the women in \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" deals in the currencies of power.\n\nDavid Sims writing for \"The A.V. Club\" enjoyed the introduction of Margaery's character in \"What Is Dead May Never Die\" commenting; \"the fun twist to this plot is that Margaery Tyrell is obviously not the blushing maiden she appears to be, but an operator just like everyone else,\" and \"Margaery could just be a cypher, a mostly silent cog in Renly's plans for dominance, but instead she's going to be a lot more.\" He uses her character to praise the writing of \"Game of Thrones\", stating that it; \"rarely traffics in cliched characterization.\" Jenna Busch of Zap2it calls Margaery a \"power player\" who will \"do anything to stay on the throne.\" Writer and editor Silvia Moreno Garcia describes Margaery as \"a sleeker, more determined player of this game of thrones\" when compared to her book characterization and goes on to comment that she is a \"shrewd politician,\" who might give the other good players a run for their money.\" She also believes she is \"older and worldlier than the one in the books.\" In \"Valar Dohaeris\", Diana Huang of UC Riverside's \"Highlander News\" appreciated the development of Margaery's character and called her \"self aware and quick-witted\" and believes she has the power to wreak havoc in King's Landing.\n\nMany commentators notice Margaery's desire and ability to gain the support of the public. Rhiannon of feministfiction writes: \"this Margaery is ambitious but kind, clearly sweet and generous, but also a master at working people's emotions in her favor. Graceful, elegant, and aware of how powerful every word can be. She's an expert at the game that Sansa has only just begun, and it is stunning to see her.\" Tiffany Brown, writing for \"TV After Dark\", states \"Margaery has gained the favor and love of the people of King's Landing, and has even garnered the affections of her future king.\" Natalie Dormer, the actress who plays Margaery, when interviewed by HitFix discussed Margaery's political savviness: Margaery brings this whole new element to the Game that you haven't seen before, which is basically PR. It's quite a modern ethos on PR and courting public affections, hopefully. We've all seen politicians kiss babies. It doesn't mean that she's insincere in her genuine hope to do charitable work and it's just an interesting new comment on how you handle the masses and how you win power that maybe we haven't seen in Westeros before. She also noted that Margaery comes from a matriarchal family and \"that she's more cut from the cloth as a protegee of her grandmother, so she knows what it's like for a woman to be in charge.\"\nFor her performance in the show, Natalie Dormer, along with the rest of the ensemble cast, was nominated for four Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively, and the cast was awarded the Empire Hero Award in 2015 by the British film magazine \"Empire\". For her performance in the third season of the show, Dormer won the Ewwy Award for Best Supporting Actress - Drama.\n"}

R. Martin, and the first season of the television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIntroduced in 1996's \"A Game of Thrones\", Viserys and his younger sister, Daenerys are the last confirmed members of House Targaryen who, until fifteen years before the events of the first novel, ruled on the Iron Throne in Westeros for nearly three hundred years. As such, they are hunted by the forces of the new king, Robert Baratheon, and have been forced to flee to the neighboring continent of Essos. Viserys is characterized by his vanity and bitterness, and often behaves cruelly towards his younger sister.\n\nViserys is portrayed by Harry Lloyd in the HBO television adaptation.\n\nViserys Targaryen is the middle child and younger son of Aerys II Targaryen, also known as The Mad King, and his sister-wife Rhaella Targaryen.\n\nViserys Targaryen is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of his sister Daenerys.\n\nViserys Targaryen is the second born son of Aerys II Targaryen. Thirteen years before the events of the series, he and his sister Daenerys fled Westeros to escape death at the hands of rebel Robert Baratheon. Viserys is an arrogant, cruel and ambitious man given to violent mood swings. In \"A Game of Thrones\", he sells his sister as a wife to the Dothraki Khal Drogo, as a means to secure the allegiance of Drogo's army toward his goal of reclaiming the throne. Frustrated with Drogo, Viserys demands a crown and threatens Daenerys and her unborn child; Drogo kills him by pouring a pot of molten gold over his head.\n\nDaenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, after Viserys. She explains that in spite of everything, he was still her brother, and that his draconic namesake will help do what he could not. She also tries to remember him as the good person he was before the stresses of their exile made him violent and bitter, and acknowledges that he at least kept her alive and safe through her childhood.\n\nViserys Targaryen is played by British actor Harry Lloyd in the television adaption of the books.\n\nHarry Lloyd on Viserys Targaryen:\n\nAs soon as I looked into more of the history of the Targaryen family and actually read the other books, I found out more and pieced together his backstory, and he became sympathetic. I understood more what motivated him, and the fear he had, and the responsibility he had, and his childishness. I mean, he never really had a parent. That changed a lot my view from reading it to playing it.\n\nLloyd on his character's death scene:\n\nI've never had to die on camera before, let alone in such a grisly way. So you just have to kind of give it everything. You talk to the two actors holding you and say, ‘Let's not pansy around here. I'm gonna absolutely try and get out of this, so don't let me.' Then, you let it rip. It can't be some sort of half-assed whimpering – you've got to really believe the pain and the fear. It's actually quite liberating.\n\nLloyd has received positive reviews for his role as Viserys in the TV series.\n\nViserys Targaryen is the exiled prince and heir of the Targaryen dynasty and is known as \"The Beggar King\" for his search for an army to recapture his throne. A narcissist, he is arrogant and self-centered, caring only about himself and looking down on others, especially his sister Daenerys. In exchange for an army to help regain the Iron Throne, Viserys marries off his sister to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in the first episode, \"Winter Is Coming\", and follows his horde's journey to the Dothraki capital to ensure Drogo will keep his end of the bargain. But as they journey, it becomes evident that Viserys does not have any leadership skills to reclaim the throne as his arrogance and disrespect for the Dothraki does not win him any hearts. Furthermore, Daenerys, whom he has always threatened throughout his life, starts to stand up to him. Seeing that Daenerys is loved by the Dothraki and that her and Drogo's unborn son is prophesied to unite the world, Viserys realizes that it is not he but Daenerys who will reclaim the Iron Throne. In the sixth episode, \"A Golden Crown\", he gets in a fit of drunken rage, threatens Drogo to give him his army and crown or he will kill his sister and her unborn son. Having had enough of his behavior, Drogo kills Viserys by giving him a \"Golden Crown\"; molten gold poured over his head. Daenerys watches her brother's agonizing death, proclaiming that he wasn't a true dragon, as \"fire cannot kill a dragon\".\n\nDaenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, as a tribute to Viserys, although the reasoning is not explained on-screen.\n"}
