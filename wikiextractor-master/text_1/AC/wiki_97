Howard\n\nCharles Stewart Howard (February 28, 1877 – June 6, 1950) was an American businessman. He made his fortune as an automobile dealer and became a prominent thoroughbred racehorse owner.\n\nHoward was dubbed one of the most successful Buick salesmen of all time. He lost his son to a car accident in 1926 at an early age and later bought the soon-to-be-famous horse Seabiscuit. According to Laura Hillenbrand's , Howard's early car dealership in San Francisco was given a boost by the hand of fate; on the day of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he was one of the few individuals who had operational vehicles in the city, and was thus able to help the rescue effort significantly.\n\nIn 1921, long before he bought Seabiscuit, Charles Howard purchased the Ridgewood Ranch at Willits in Mendocino County. His 15-year-old son, Frankie, died there in 1926 after a truck accident on the property (the elder Howard established the Frank R. Howard Memorial Hospital as a memorial to his son). Used as a secondary residence, by the 1930s Howard had converted part of the ranch into a thoroughbred horse breeding and training center. Although Seabiscuit was the most famous resident at Ridgewood Ranch, Charles Howard owned many horses in his secondary career as a Thoroughbred owner including Kayak II (also Kajak) and Hall of Fame colt Noor, the first of only two horses to defeat two U.S. Triple Crown champions.\n\nCharles Howard died of a heart attack in 1950 and was buried in the Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. Ridgewood Ranch was sold by his heirs, with some of the horses sent to his son Lindsay's Binglin Stable in Moorpark, California.\n\n\n"}

It has almost 72,000 inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the region. Havířov lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.\n\nHavířov was founded after World War II (thus being the youngest city in today's Czech Republic) as a coal mining town. Havířov officially became a town in 1955. It was built on top of several villages with significant Polish populations. The local people were given apartments in the newly built city, and most of their old houses were demolished to make room for new urban buildings. The majority of the population of Havířov emigrated from other parts of Czechoslovakia, many of them from Slovakia, as migrant workers, thus substantially altering the ethnic structure of the area. Today, the original villages are administratively part of the city and mostly lie on the outskirts of urban Havířov.\n\nIn a competition to name the city in 1956, various names were suggested, such as Stalin, Gottwaldův Horníkov (after Klement Gottwald), Zápotockýgrad (after Antonín Zápotocký) and \"Čestprácov\" (derived from the Socialist-era greeting \"čest práci\"). Eventually it was decided that the city should be named Havířov, from \"havíř\", \"miner\", and the possessive suffix -ov.\n\nHavířov was founded after the Second World War. Most of the buildings of the new city were built in the style of Socialist Realism.\n\nThe city's football club, MFK Havířov, competes in the Czech Fourth Division. In the past, the team appeared for several seasons in Czech 2. Liga. Football club MFK Havířov was founded in 1922. MFK Havířov entered into a contract with sports brand JOMA for four years. MFK Havířov has two pitches and one artificial pitch. They have nickname which is \"indians\" according to American bikers. Their matches are played on pitches in Prostřední Suchá.\n\nThe ice hockey club AZ Havířov appears in the First National Hockey League, the second-tier league of ice hockey in the country.\n\nRC Havířov competes in the highest division of rugby in the Czech Republic, the KB Extraliga.\n\nHavířov hosted the prologue and the third stage, both an individual time trial, of the 2012 and 2013 Gracia-Orlová.\n\nHavířov is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

BRC developed from the Atlas of the British Flora project of the Botanical Society of the British Isles (BSBI) to map the distribution of British (and Irish) flowering plants, which had established basic principles for biological recording in the UK. The former BSBI project leader, Dr Franklyn Perring, established BRC with the project’s original data and data processing equipment.\n\nAs part of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), BRC provides a focus for the collation, management, dissemination and interpretation of species observations (biological records). BRC is now based at CEH Wallingford, near Oxford. Most records are collected by volunteer recording schemes and societies, which are integral to the work of BRC. These activities are supported through a long-term funding partnership between the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).\n\nTogether with more than 80 recording schemes and societies, BRC supports biological recording\nfor a wide range of plant and animal groups. BRC helps the recording community to publish atlases, datasets and other online resources, providing information for research, policy and the conservation of wildlife. Through the use of technology BRC helps to harness the enthusiasm and knowledge of naturalists and to enable them to collate and analyse their records. To celebrate the BRC's 50th Anniversary, a special issue of the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society was published with 23 research and review articles covering the Centre's work.\n\nIn addition to its work with recording schemes and societies, BRC has played a key role in the greater integration of biological recording activities in the UK, most recently through the National Biodiversity Network (NBN). BRC helped to found the National Federation for Biological Recording (NFBR) in 1986 and carried out much of the survey and analysis for the report of the Coordinating Commission for Biological Recording (CCBR) published in 1995, both of which helped shape the future of biological recording in the UK.\n\nA network of local biological records centres or local environmental records centres (usually abbreviated to BRC, LRC or LERC,) covers most areas of the UK. All local centres are entirely independent of the Biological Records Centre. The first such local centre was the Natural History Record Bureau at what is now Tullie House Museum in Carlisle which opened in 1902. As with many LERCs it grew out of the biological recording work of the local natural history society. LERCs have a complementary role to BRC and recording schemes as systems \"\"for collating biological data from a wide range of sources (including organisations and individuals), for ensuring that data are properly validated and catalogued, and for providing access to them, thereby acting as a focus for biological information.\"\" Local Environmental Records Centres are non-profit, partnership-led organisations and typically organised on a county or multi-county basis. Increasingly they are becoming better networked through the activities of the Association of Local Environmental Records Centres, the National Biodiversity Network, Natural England, The Wildlife Trusts partnership and NFBR, which became the National Forum for Biological Recording in 2013. rECOrd is an example of a Local Environmental Records Centre.\n\n\n"}

In the 19th century, the people of Guernsey complained that this system was inadequate for a growing population, and a professional police force was demanded. The parish constables retained their historic role, but from 1853 uniformed assistant constables were appointed. Initially there were four of them, with a uniform hat and belt worn over their civilian clothing. They provided full-time policing, under the authority of the elected parish constables.\n\nThe current police force was formed following approval by the States of Deliberation in March 1915, consisting of an inspector, two sergeants, two corporals and eleven constables, with the force being formally founded on 10 April 1920. During the five year German occupation of the Channel Islands the police had a difficult time whilst working alongside the German military police and the \"Feldgendarmerie\" (field police). In 1945 the force resumed its normal role and is now considerably expanded, as of 2018 it had 151 officers. These are supported by 94 civilian staff, who work in roles where warranted officers are not required.\n\nFrom March 2015, emergency calls for all emergency services in Guernsey have been routed through the \"Joint Emergency Services Control Centre\" (JESCC), linking police, fire, ambulance and coastguard services.\n\nIn late January 2019, Guernsey Police led the investigation into the high-profile disappearance of Argentinian footballer Emiliano Sala, whose aircraft had last made radar contact near Alderney.\n\nOn the 10th April 2020, the Guernsey Police celebrated it's 100th Anniversary, with a planned set of events to commemorate this event. These events were postponed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a lockdown of the island as positive cases were confirmed in the island.\n\nThe force is headed by a chief officer (CO), with two deputy chief officer's (DCO) as a joint second in command. The current Chief Officer of the Guernsey Police is Ruari Hardy, After the retirement of the previous Chief Officer, Patrick Rice. As of 2020, the two Deputy Chief Officers are Philip Breban and Ian Scholes. Each of the four branches within the Guernsey Police is headed by a chief inspector; the branches are uniformed operations, crime services, operations and specialist services. Significant units within these four divisions include the commercial fraud department, the explosive ordnance disposal unit and the police dog section.\n\nIn 2015, Guernsey Police's control room for bailiwick and the Islands of Guernsey, Alderney, Herm, and Sark was combined into one central location. Operators in the room use a bespoke Computer-aided dispatch software to manage, Police, Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service, Guernsey Fire and Rescue Service, and Guernsey Coastguard 999 (emergency telephone number) Calls. All four emergency services were merged into one area and all operators are trained to deal with emergency and non-emergency calls, similar to the Police 101 and the NHS 111 services. JESCC does not offer on the phone medical advice like the 111 service but triage's calls through a standardised set of questions as part of their Computer-aided dispatch system.\n\nGuernsey Coastguard is also based within the Joint Emergency Services control centre and maintains and 24/7 watch on Channel 16 VHF and its local frequency, VHF channel 20. Guernsey Costguard also broadcasts marine Navigation Warnings for the terrestrial waters within the Bailiwick of Guernsey.\n\nJESCC staff are all trained in emergency call handling, dispatch of all services land based emergency services and Coastguard Search and rescue. \nStaff in JESCC are civilians and not members of the Guernsey Police.\n\nGuernsey Police has a system of special constables, with three distinct types of volunteer officer, known as 'A', 'B', or 'C' division of the special constabulary.\n\n'A' division special constables are full-time employees of third party agencies who are granted limited police powers within their workplace, to provide a first response whilst professional police officers are travelling to an incident; for example, a number of hospital porters are sworn as 'A' division special constables to provide an enhanced level of hospital security.\n\n'B' division special constables are fully trained to support their full-time colleagues in all aspects of policing. They are commonly deployed in tandem with professional colleagues at large scale public events, and during weekend periods.\n\n'C' division special constables carry out the duties of a traffic warden, but have certain police powers in respect of traffic control, for example around school areas at peak times.\n\n\n"}

The station would change its call sign to CHOM-FM almost two years later, on October 19, 1971.\n\nIn 1974, CHOM-FM proposed to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission a plan in which the station would become bilingual (English/French). The CRTC accepted this plan but only on an experimental basis that would last three years; it also blocked a plan to implement quadraphonic broadcasting. In 1977, the station was forced by the CRTC to opt between the two languages, and after considering becoming a French-language station, it finally reverted to English full-time. On-air advertising steadily increased during the late 1970s. Furthermore, CHOM's original format of AOR and \"underground\" rock tunes (many of which were longer than the average 3 minutes in length) changed to include the playing of more top 40-type hits. Undoubtedly, record companies also began to complain that the playing of entire albums on air cut into their revenue as more and more listeners had access to cassette recorders.\n\nCHOM-FM became increasingly popular, and in 1979 surpassed sister station CKGM in Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings. Both stations were sold to CHUM Limited on August 20, 1985.\nThe station acquired the rights to the syndicated show by Howard Stern which made its debut on CHOM-FM on September 2, 1997 amid much controversy as he launched himself on his very first show heard in Montreal in an anti-Francophone/anti-French tirade. His show was cancelled a year later, on August 27, 1998, after numerous complaints to the CRTC about politically incorrect remarks interpreted by complainants as sexist and homophobic.\n\nEffective in January 2002, the station was sold to Standard Broadcasting, which already owned CJAD and CJFM-FM in Montreal, in exchange for Standard's CFWM-FM in Winnipeg.\n\nOwnership changed hands again when on October 29, 2007, Astral Media took control of Standard Broadcasting and its assets.\n\nOn October 19, 2010, CHOM-FM celebrated its 40th anniversary as a radio station.\n\nOn June 22, 2011, it was announced that Terry DiMonte will be making a return to the station, however it is unlikely that he and Ted Bird will reunite on air.\n\nOn July 2013, Astral Media was acquired and dissolved by Bell Media. CHOM-FM has been reunited with its original AM station CKGM which CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media) acquired from CHUM in 2007.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, longtime radio personality TooTall (Robert Wagenaar) retired from his mid-day show after over 40 years at CHOM-FM. His replacement is Randy Renaud, a 30 year veteran of the radio station.\n\n1963-1971: CKGM-FM<br>\n1971-1980s: CHOM-FM MONTREAL (with logo having a heart in a circle)<br>\n1980s: chom 98 ROCK<br>\n1990s-2002: Montreal's Home for Classic Rock: CHOM 97.7 fm<br>\n2002–Present: CHOM 97-7 (even since logo change in 2010, the branding is unchanged from 2002.)\n\nWhen first launched in 1963, CHOM-FM (then known as CKGM-FM) was originally based at 1455 Drummond Street in Montreal, along with the AM CKGM. Like CKGM, it moved to 1310 Greene Avenue in Westmount in the late 1960s.\n\nIn 1972, CHOM relocated across the street to 1355 Greene Avenue, while CKGM opted to stay at 1310 Greene. CHOM eventually returned to the CKGM building a few years later and remained located there until its acquisition by Standard Broadcasting in 2002. At this point, CHOM-FM was moved to 1411 Fort Street in Montreal (the building that housed Standard's other two existing Montreal radio stations, CJFM-FM and CJAD).\n\nIn September 2012, Astral Media relocated its local English-language radio stations (including CHOM-FM) to its French-language radio studios at 1717 René Lévesque Boulevard East in Montreal.\n\n"}

He also contributes regularly to the Comment page of \"The Guardian\", as well as occasional articles for the other broadsheets. He currently writes a column in \"The Financial Times\" Wealth magazine.\n\nSpeaking on Channel 4's 2013 \"Psychopath Night\", James described the credit crunch as a \"mass outbreak of corporate psychopathy which resulted in something that very nearly crashed the whole world economy\".\n\nIn 1982, James made his first television series, for Granada for the ITV network, about childcare (\"Under Fives\"). He made two further educational series, one for Channel 4 (\"Sex With Paula\", 1987) and one for ITV (\"Men On Violence\", 1988, for LWT). He originated and was associate producer of the ITV documentary \"The Man who shot John Lennon\".\n\nHe was the interviewer and producer of the 44 interviews in Room 113 for the two series of the BAFTA-award-winning Network 7 youth programme on Channel 4. The interviews in Room 113 were described by Chris Dunckley in the \"Financial Times\" as \"The most frank since John Freeman's Face-to-Face in the Fifties\".\n\nIn 1990 he produced a documentary for Channel 4 about the \"Mail on Sunday\" and in 1992 he contributed three films, two as Producer and one as Producer-Presenter, to the BBC 2 Crime and Punishment season. \"Rape\", for \"40 Minutes\", recorded the meeting of a rapist and a rape victim. \"Prisoner XYY/334422\", also for \"40 Minutes\", was about the psychology of an imprisoned psychopath.\n\n\"Wot U Looking At?\", for the science programme Horizon, presented his influential explanation (from his monograph \"Juvenile Violence in a Winner-Loser Culture\") for why the poor are more violent than the rich and why, at the time, violence had been rocketing since 1987 in the UK.\n\nIn 1995 he produced, directed and presented a forty-minute Late Show documentary for BBC2, \"Prozac Diary\", in which artists took the drug to see how it affected their work.

He emphasises that although it is rare for a person to develop very high levels of emotional health, his book intends to indicate how it can be incrementally improved over time.\n\nHis book \"Not In Your Genes\" (2016) argued that no genes have been found which significantly explain our individual psychology, such as intelligence or mental health, and claimed that nurture is extremely important, explaining why siblings are different and why traits run in family. Also published in 2016, his book \"Upping Your Ziggy - How David Bowie Faced His Childhood Demons and How You Can Face Yours\" analyses how Bowie used his lyrics and stage personas to deal with his fear of madness, resulting from his family background. It explores the environmental causes of schizophrenia.\n\nDuring his career in psychology, James has attracted controversy with his views on the nature versus nurture debate.\n\nStuart Ritchie, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, wrote a strongly critical review of James's book \"Not In Your Genes\". He described the book as a \"straw man made flesh\", \"a compendium of psychological myths and legends\", and \"bending over backwards to avoid awkward conclusions\". Ritchie wrote, \"Few books risk such damage to the public understanding of science as those by Oliver James\", and accused James of \"scientific illiteracy\".\n\nRitchie described the book's thesis as \"children are born with brains of soft clay, their mental makeup unaffected by genes and infinitely mouldable by their parents\", and that \"DNA has no effect on the mind or mental health, whereas parenting reigns supreme\". Ritchie described a variety of evidence which contradicts this view.\n\nRitchie also responded to a letter from James in \"The Psychologist\" magazine, following which James and Prof Richard Bentall of the University of Liverpool engaged him in argument.\n\nJames responded to Ritchie's criticisms in an article in \"The Guardian\" in March 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is populated by Haredi Jews, and was built by members of the Old Yishuv. The oldest Sephardic Haredi dynasty, Levi Kahana of Spain, has a religious cultural center in the neighborhood.\n\nThe name \"Mea Shearim\" is derived from a verse from Genesis, which happened to be part of the weekly Torah portion that was read the week the settlement was founded: \"Isaac sowed in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundredfold (, \"mea shearim\"); God had blessed him\" (). According to a tradition, the community originally had 100 gates, another meaning of \"mea shearim\".\n\nMeir Auerbach, the chief Ashkenazi rabbi of Jerusalem, was one of the founders of the neighborhood.\nConrad Schick, a German Christian architect and missionary, drew up the first blueprint for Mea Shearim in 1846. Mea Shearim, one of the earliest Jewish settlements outside the walls of the Old City, was established in 1874 by a building society of 100 shareholders. Pooling their resources, the society members purchased a tract of land outside the walled city, which was severely overcrowded and plagued by poor sanitation, and built a new neighborhood with the goal of improving their standards of living.\n\nYosef Rivlin, one of the heads of the Jewish community in Jerusalem, and a Christian Arab from Bethlehem were the contractors. The work was carried out by both Jewish and non-Jewish workers.\nMea Shearim was structured as a courtyard neighborhood. It was surrounded by a wall, with gates that were locked every evening. By October 1880, 100 apartments were ready for occupancy, and a lottery was held to assign them to families. By the turn of the century, there were 300 houses, a flour mill and a bakery. Conrad Schick planned for open green space in each courtyard, but cowsheds were built instead. Mea Shearim was the first quarter in Jerusalem to have street lights.\nToday, Mea Shearim remains an insular neighbourhood in the heart of Jerusalem. With its Haredi and overwhelmingly Hasidic population, the streets retain the characteristics of an Eastern European shtetl, as it would have appeared in pre-war Europe. Life revolves around strict adherence to Jewish law, prayer, and the study of Jewish religious texts. Traditions in dress include black frock coats and black hats for men (although there are some other clothing styles, depending on the religious sub-group to which they belong), and long-sleeved, modest clothing for women. In some Hasidic groups, the women wear thick black stockings all year long, even in summer. Married women wear a variety of hair coverings, from wigs to scarves and snoods. The men have beards, and many grow long sidecurls, called peyot. Many residents speak Yiddish in their daily lives, and use Hebrew only for prayer and religious study, as they believe Hebrew to be a sacred language only to be used for religious purposes.\n\nHasidic groups with a large number of followers in Mea Shearim include: Breslov, Slonim, Toldos Aharon, Toldos Avraham Yitzchak, Mishkenos HaRoim, and Satmar. The Pinsk-Karlin dynasty also has its center here. The Edah HaChareidis, which supervises kashrut certification and runs a Jewish religious court, has its headquarters at the western end of Mea Shearim. Mea Shearim is the stronghold of both factions of the Neturei Karta movement, as well as the movement whence they sprang, the descendants of the original Perushim community, also known as \"Yerushalmis\". Some residents have asked to live under Arab rule. The late Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, the leading posek of Litvish/Yeshivish Jewry, made his home here.\n\n\"Modesty\" posters in Hebrew and English are hung at every entrance to Mea Shearim. When visiting the neighborhood, women and girls are urged to wear what is deemed to be modest dress (knee-length skirts or longer, no plunging necklines or midriff tops, no sleeveless blouses or bare shoulders), men and boys are urged to avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless shirts, tourists are requested not to arrive in large, conspicuous groups and in some of the older signs even non-jews are requested to wear Kippahs. During Shabbat (from Friday night at sundown to Saturday night at sundown), visitors are asked to refrain from smoking, photography, driving or using mobile phones. When entering synagogues, men are asked to cover their heads.\n\nResidents have been criticized for attacking police, and other government officials entering the area with stones, and blocking the streets, or setting fire to rubbish when they try to do so (otherwise known as Hafganahs). \n\nA small, violent group called \"The Sikrikim\", of less than 100 families, enforce censorship on bookshops, causing over 250,000 NIS damage to a shop that resisted their demands.\n\nOn 24 June 2010 politicians Uri Maklev and Moshe Gafni of the Haredic United Torah Judaism were attacked after they had visited the Slonim rabbi and had entered his synagogue to pray. When they emerged, they were set upon by young extremists affiliated with Neturei Karta who spat at them and physically assaulted them.\n\nIn April 2015, an IDF officer was attacked by men and women of Mea Shearim who allegedly threatened to kill him, while children blocked his exit. The incident received national attention. The attack was condemned by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as \"outrageous\", and by Shas leader Arye Deri as \"an act of terror\".\n\n\n"}

It was begun in 1802 by the British infantry officer William Lambton, under the auspices of the East India Company. Under the leadership of his successor, George Everest, the project was made the responsibility of the Survey of India. Everest was succeeded by Andrew Scott Waugh and after 1861 the project was led by James Walker, who oversaw its completion in 1871.\n\nAmong the many accomplishments of the Survey were the demarcation of the British territories in India and the measurement of the height of the Himalayan giants: Everest, K2, and Kanchenjunga. The Survey had an enormous scientific impact as well, being responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly which led to the development of the theories of isostasy.\n\nThe native surveyors made use of in the Himalayas, especially in the Tibetan region where Europeans were not allowed, were called pandits, who included the cousins Nain Singh Rawat and Krishna Singh Rawat.\n\nFrom its inception in 1600 to the beginning of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company gained more territory on the Indian subcontinent. With the acquisition of new territory, it employed several explorers and cartographers to provide maps and other information on its territories, most notably James Rennell, from 1767 in Bengal. As Rennell proceeded to make maps, some serious flaws in them surfaced, based on a lack of precise measurements. In 1800, shortly after the English victory over Tipu Sultan, William Lambton, an infantry soldier with experience in surveying proposed to remedy precisely that, through a series of triangulations initially through the newly acquired territory of Mysore and eventually across the entire subcontinent.\n\nThe Great Trigonometrical Survey of India started on 10 April 1802 with the measurement of a baseline near Madras. Major Lambton selected the flat plains with St. Thomas Mount at the north end and Perumbauk hill at the southern end. The baseline was long. Lieutenant Kater was despatched to find high vantage points on the hills of the west so that the coastal points of Tellicherry and Cannanore could be connected. The high hills chosen were Mount Delly and Tadiandamol. The distance from coast to coast was and this survey line was completed in 1806. The East India Company thought that this project would take about 5 years but eventually it took nearly 70 years well past the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the end of company rule in India. Because of the extent of the land to be surveyed, the surveyors did not triangulate the whole of India but instead created what they called a \"gridiron\" of triangulation chains running from North to South and East to West. At times the survey party numbered 700 people.\nThe Trigonometrical Survey was conducted independently of other surveys, notably the topographical and revenue surveys. In 1875, the decision was taken that the Survey budget should be reduced from 240,000 to 200,000 pounds. This resulted in a reorganization under Surveyor-General Colonel J.T. Walker to amalgamate the Great Trigonometrical, Topographical and Revenue Surveys into the Survey of India.\n\nTriangulation surveys were based on a few carefully measured baselines and a series of angles. The initial baseline was measured with great care since the accuracy of the subsequent survey was critically dependent upon it. Various corrections were applied, principally temperature. An especially accurate folding chain was used, laid on horizontal tables, all shaded from the sun and with constant tension. The early surveys made use of large and bulky theodolites made by William Carey, a Zenith sector made by Jesse Ramsden and chains. Later surveys used more compact theodolites. \nAccurate instruments could not always be purchased through the standard system of government contract and Everest personally supervised the construction of instruments. He had a maker, Henry Barrow, set up an instrument company in Calcutta. For a while Barrow was succeeded by Syed Mohsin from Arcot and after his death the instruments were supplied by Cooke from York.\nTo achieve the highest accuracy a number of corrections were applied to all distances calculated from simple trigonometry:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The report, entitled \"Children and their Primary Schools\", reviewed primary education in a wholesale fashion. The collation of the report took around 3 years. The Council was chaired by Bridget, Lady Plowden after whom the report is named.\n\nThe report was commissioned by Education minister, Sir Edward Boyle in 1963. He requested that the council \"consider primary education in all its aspects and the transition to secondary education.\" \n\nAt that time, the last such investigation into the nature of primary education had been undertaken by the Hadow Committee led by Sir William Henry Hadow in the early 1930s. During the time of collating the report, the Labour Government of the day introduced circular 10/65 requesting that local education authorities submit plans to replace the tripartite system and 11-plus with comprehensive schooling. The administration also made clear its intention to raise school-leaving age to 16 (from the then 15).\n\nIn the years leading up to, and during the collation of the report, prevalent thinking in educational psychology was highly influenced by the work of such people as Jean Piaget who published a seminal work on the matter in 1962.\n\nThe report was widely known for its praising of child-centred approaches to education, stressing that \"at the heart of the educational process lies the child\".\n\nRecommendations in the report included those listed below:\n\nBy the time the report was returned to the Ministry of Education, the change of government had led to the appointment of Anthony Crosland as minister. He received the report in 1967, but implementation of the recommendations was piecemeal.\n\nIn some areas, local education authorities implemented changes themselves, such as the introduction of three-tier education systems in many places. Similarly, over the 40 years, many of the recommendations which first appeared in the report, have evolved and appeared in legislation under other guises, such as the widespread introduction of state-funded nursery provision, Extended Schools, requirement for a Home School Agreement to be presented (but not signed), the ban on corporal punishment, ESOL programmes, Educational Action Zones and most of all the comprehensive system. However the three-tier system is now uncommon in Britain with a two-tier system of primary school followed by a transition aged 11 to secondary school being normal. The system of children transferring to secondary school at the age of 12 has now been almost completely abandoned.\n\nMale teachers remain a small minority in primaries.\n\nA new review of primary education in England began on 2 October 2006 under the leadership of Professor Robin Alexander under the title The Primary Review.\n\nThe official records of the Plowden committee are held in the records created or inherited by the Department of Education and Science, and of related bodies The National Archives. The personal papers of Bridget Horatia Plowden, including records regarding the Plowden Report are held in the Archives of the Institute of Education, University of London, (Ref: DC/PL) .\n\n"}

It is for girls aged 11 to 18. The campus is situated near the Sussex Downs, on a cliff overlooking Brighton Marina and the English Channel.\n\nThe school incorporates dance studios, music classrooms, a 320-seat theatre, a heated indoor swimming pool, a golf course, a private tunnel to the beach, a farm and a chapel, as well as a range of workshops, studios, laboratories and sports pitches.\n\nRoedean School is a member of the Girls' Schools Association and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). The \"Good Schools Guide\" stated that the \"School has a healthy spirit and much to offer.\" The Independent Schools Inspectorate rated Roedean as Excellent in all areas (highest category) in its most recent inspection (March 2016).\n\nThe school was founded in 1885 as Wimbledon House by three sisters: Penelope, Millicent, and Dorothy Lawrence. Their brother was the lawyer Sir Paul Lawrence of Wimbledon, who helped them considerably. Their Lawrence great aunts had been noted school teachers earlier in the century, mainly in Liverpool. Roedean was founded to prepare girls for entrance to the newly opened women's colleges at Cambridge University, Girton (now co-ed) and Newnham Colleges. In 1898, the school moved to its present site, occupying new buildings designed by the architect Sir John Simpson. A sister school, also called Roedean School and co-founded by the youngest Lawrence sister, Theresa, in 1903, is located in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nThe school motto, \"Honneur aulx dignes\", is in Norman French, and means \"Honour the worthy\". When pronounced, it sounds like \"Honour Roedean\".\n\nDuring the Second World War, the students and staff were temporarily evacuated to Keswick, in the north of England. The school buildings in Brighton, Sussex were used by the Admiralty. They adapted it for use by Navy cadets attending the Mining and Torpedo School (known as HMS \"Vernon\"). Roedean is one the few girls' schools in the country to have an Old Boys' Association.\n\nThe artist Percy Shakespeare was killed by a German bomb while serving at Roedean.\n\nInspired by his friend William Carus-Wilson, who founded Cowan Bridge School, Reverend Henry Venn Elliott proposed to found a similar school for the county. St Mary's Hall was opened in 1836 and was the second-oldest girls' school in the United Kingdom before it was closed in 2009. At that time, its junior section became Roedean's junior school while many senior girls transferred to Roedean. The junior school was closed in 2011 as the school administration decided to focus on secondary and sixth form education.\n\nRoedean School is set in of grounds off Roedean Way, at the top of a cliff on the Sussex Downs overlooking the sea, approximately in line with Brighton Marina.\n\nThe school community is divided into houses.\n\nThe Lawrence and Tanner House (with Senior and Junior wings) system, introduced in 2005, was reversed starting in 2010. A numbered house system was reintroduced. Roedean school has the longest corridor in England.\n\nYear 7 to Year 11 students are spread out amongst House 1, 2, 3, 4. These are named after the house numbers 1–4 of Lewes Crescent, where the School was located prior to moving in 1898 to this campus built for it.\n\nSixth form (Years 12–13) are admitted to Keswick House and Lawrence House, which is detached from the main school building.\n\nIn the 1960s, the houses were:\nJunior House;\nHouse Number 1;\nHouse Number 2;\nHouse Number 3;\nHouse Number 4;\nand a Sanatorium. In 1966 part of the Sanatorium was made into rooms for VIth form girls, two VI form girls from every numbered house. The School retains a sanatorium wing (now known as a health centre) to this day.\n\nRoedean is a selective school, and entry to the school is based upon various examinations, interviews and reports from the girls' previous schools.\nEntry at 11+ and 13+ is through the Common Entrance Examination or the Schools own entrance exams\nApplicants of 11+ and 13+ who are unable to take the Common Entrance Examination, those wishing to enter at 12+ and 14+ and overseas applicants may sit the Roedean entrance examination.\n\nPast pupils are known as and include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ABW is responsible for analyzing, reporting and preventing threats to Poland's internal security, including terrorism, foreign espionage, arms smuggling, drug trafficking, organized crime, corruption and economic coercion. Its powers include arresting individuals, conducting searches and investigations, and combating terrorism with a specialized armed anti-terrorist force.\n\nThe ABW is headquartered on ul. Rakowiecka in the Mokotów district of Warsaw. As part of its institutional hierarchy, the Head of the ABW reports directly to the Prime Minister of Poland, who in turn provides oversight of the ABW, or can appoint a special minister to coordinate intelligence and security activities for oversight. The ABW is considered by the government of Poland to be one of the nation's special services.\n\nThe ABW was created under the premiership of Leszek Miller on 24 May 2002, following the Council of Ministers' submission of its legislation on the Internal Security Agency and Foreign Intelligence Agency bill to the Sejm for approval. The legislation effectively split the previous national intelligence service, the Urząd Ochrony Państwa (UOP), into two separate components: the Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego (ABW), responsible for domestic intelligence operations, and the Agencja Wywiadu (AW), dedicated to gathering and analyzing foreign intelligence outside of Poland.\n\nIn accordance to Article 5 of the 2002 Internal Security Agency and Foreign Intelligence Agency Law, the ABW is tasked to protect Polish citizens, property and the state in a number of fields. These operations include domestic counter-intelligence activities, ensuring economic security, counter-terrorism and weapons proliferation, combating organized crime, securing state classified information, and protecting Polish cyberspace operations. According to law, ABW investigations must be preceded by a warrant issued from a regional court after a submitted request from the ABW's Head. The ABW works closely with other security apparatuses in counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism operations to pool data, including the Agencja Wywiadu, the Policja, the Straż Graniczna and the Biuro Ochrony Rządu.\n\nThe ABW also monitors corruption among state agencies and officials. According to its 2009 report, the ABW monitored 82 state enterprises undergoing privatization, as well as monitored the flow of European Union funds to Polish coffers. Ministries of state have been subject to investigations from the ABW for financial irregularities, including the ministries for Finance, National Defence, Environment, Justice, Interior and Administration, and GDDKiA.\n\nAmong the agency's powers, the ABW reserves the right to arrest individuals, search individuals and premises, inspect cargo from land, water and air transport, and request assistance from other Polish security services and government bodies.\n\nThe ABW's central operations center is located in the Mokotów borough of Warsaw along ul. Rakowiecka, standing in close proximity to Mokotów Prison and the Ministry of Interior and Administration. The agency's training center is located in the village of Emów, east of Warsaw in Masovian Voivodeship. The ABW maintains offices in nearly all of Poland's major cities, including Białystok, Bydgoszcz, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków, Lublin, Łódź, Olsztyn, Opole, Poznań, Radom, Rzeszów, Szczecin, Warsaw, Wrocław and Zielona Góra. Additionally, the ABW maintains international liaison offices within Polish diplomatic missions in Berlin, Brussels, Kiev, London, Moscow and Prague.\nInternationally, the ABW works closely with the intelligence and security agencies of fellow NATO and European Union member states, as well as outside states including Afghanistan, Israel, Kazakhstan and Montenegro. The ABW also worked closely with the Security Service of Ukraine in preparation for the UEFA Euro 2012 over the coordination of security plans.\n\nThe activities of the ABW, along with the other special services (including the AW and the CBA) are provided oversight by the Prime Minister of Poland directly, or through a specially appointed minister working within the Chancellery. The Head of the ABW reports to the prime minister regarding security matters of concern. The prime minister also retains the right to propose candidates to lead the ABW; nominated individuals are then subject to the opinion of the President of Poland. The president also reserves the right to receive information from the ABW Head regarding security concerns.\n\nA Committee of Special Services under the Council of Ministers within the Chancellery retains responsibility of planning, coordinating and overseeing the activities of the ABW and all other special services. The agency's legal activities are tied to the Public Prosecutor General, who is regularly informed by the ABW's Head of the agency's course of actions. Additionally, the Special Services Committee within the Sejm evaluates the performance of the agency, giving opinion to budgetary concerns, investigations and cooperation among the special services.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, killing President Lech Kaczyński and other senior members of the armed forces and government, members of the Law and Justice party alleged that leaked memos showed the agency had spied on the late president and First Lady Maria Kaczyńska during a state visit to Georgia in 2008.\n\nIn May 2011, the ABW conducted a dawn raid on the home of the owner of AntyKomor.pl, a satirical website critical of Polish president Bronisław Komorowski, citing that the website was in breach of Article 135 of the Polish Penal Code for insulting the president. In response to opposition allegations of stifling free speech, Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated afterwards that the agency was a victim of the penal code's legal vagueness. Later, Prime Minister Tusk criticized the agency for acting \"overzealous.\"\n\nMarcin Idzik, who served as the CEO in the years 2013-2015 of the state-owned arms firm Bumar (since renamed as \"Polski Holding Obronny\"-Polish Defense Holding) has alleged that in 2013 he asked for an investigation by the ABW of a former Bumar sales agent Pierre Dadak on the suspicions of fraud. Dadak has been very closely associated with Krzysztof Wegrzyn, a wealthy businessman and former deputy defense minister, generally regarded as a member of the elite. Idzik claims that the ABW were unwilling to investigate Dadak, leading him to say: \"I was the chief of the biggest Polish defense company and somebody wheedled money. For me, [is it] strange? Yeah, 400 percent.\" The ABW has refused to comment on the matter.\n\nIn June 2014, the ABW conducted a raid on editorial office of \"Wprost\" newspaper, after \"Wprost\" published stenographic records of private conversations between country officials implicating them in many unconstitutional acts and bribery. The ABW used physical force on newspapers editor-in-chief Sylwester Latkowski in an attempt to illegally seize his laptop computer, after he refused to give it away without court warrant.\n\n\n"}

The college, originally established as an Anglican school for boys, accepts boys and girls at various levels of education: Bridge Nursery, Pre-Preparatory, Preparatory, College, and Sixth Form. St John’s College campus is located in Houghton, Johannesburg, and it is a part of the Independent Schools Association of Southern Africa. The Old Johannian Association is the official St John's College alumni organization.\n\nSt John's College was founded in Johannesburg on 1 August 1898 and is an Anglican school. It was founded by the Revd Mr John Darragh, rector of St Mary's Anglican Church, Eloff Street, Johannesburg. He persuaded his parish council of the need to establish an Anglican school for boys. His curate, the Revd Mr J L Hodgson, was appointed the first Headmaster. The first classes started in a house in Plein Street, Johannesburg with two desks and seven pupils aged six to 14. However the school was forced to close at the end of 1899 due to the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War. St John's re-opened in 1902 two months after the signing of the peace treaty, and grew rapidly under Mr Hodgson and eight staff. \n\nSoon there were 180 boys, which was too many for the Plein Street premises, and St John's moved to larger premises in a wood and iron building near the Union Grounds between Joubert Park and the old Wanderers (now Johannesburg's main railway station). However, the British colonial government under Lord Milner was ideologically opposed to private schools believing that they were not beneficial to society. In order to Anglicize the Transvaal area during the Anglo-Boer war, Milner set out to influence British education in the area for the English-speaking populations. He founded a series of schools known as the \"Milner Schools\" in South Africa. Over the next few years the school's enrollment plummeted as a result of policies introduced by the Transvaal administration, including the creation of public schools (such as King Edward VII School) within a short distance of their private counterparts. \n\nIn 1904, the parish was relieved of the responsibility for St John's College, which became a diocesan institution. However, by 1905 St John's was facing closure, and an approach was made by the diocesan board of education to the Community of the Resurrection (an Anglo Catholic order of missionary priests and lay brothers) to take over the school, they would later establish what is now St. Martin's School. In 1906 Father James Nash became the new headmaster and oversaw the move north out of the city to the current site on across Houghton Ridge.\n\nIn 1907 the school had opened in Houghton and accepted its first boarders. By then it had 100 boys, and four college houses had been instituted: Nash, Thomson, Alston and Rakers (which became Hill in 1910). \n\nThe bell tower completed in 1933, houses one of the largest bells in South Africa. It also has the largest clock in South Africa, the only other one comparable to it in size was in the Rissik Street Post Office. The flag at the top of the bell tower is changed every day, from the South African flag, to the St Johns College flag, to the flag of St George. The Headmaster during 1930-35 was the Revd Charles H.S. Runge DSO MC*, who had served in France from 1914–18, before being ordained in 1922. His name is remembered as that of Runge House at the school.\n\nThe Community of the Resurrection relinquished control of the school to the Diocese of Johannesburg in 1934. In 1935, Rev S.H. Clarke began his two decades as Headmaster. In 1954 Deane Yates became the first lay headmaster. By then there were 664 boys, 375 in the college, 100 boarders in the Prep. During Yates’ headship St. John's College has widened in interests and outlook. Boys and masters move towards a broader and more modern concept of education and an appreciation and critical understanding of the rapidly changing life of Johannesburg, of South Africa, and of the world at large.\n\nIn 1972 Jan Breitenbach becomes the first South African Headmaster. Cadet corps ceases to exist. The first female is accepted into Sixth Form. In 1973 at 75 years old the school becomes a three-term school.\n\nIn 1977, the first computer on campus was installed in Pelican Quad. \n\nIn 1984 under the guidance of Headmaster Walter Macfarlane (OJ) 17 ‘legal’ versions of the school uniform are whittled down to two: Number Ones and summer khakis. Sixth Form girls are given a uniform. Electric bells take over signalling the end of periods from the bell manually rung by School Orderly Abie Moroane. A new school constitution, including the composition of council, becomes effective and lasts until 1998.\n\nIn 1994, Macfarlane retires as Headmaster, and Robert Clarence is appointed in his place.\n\nDuring 1997, Robert Clarence departs as Headmaster. Alan \"Takkie\" Wilcock replaces him as acting Headmaster, and fully moves into the post the following year.\n\nIn 1998, the school celebrated its centenary year. The 100-year celebration was commemorated by a mass of thanksgiving held on Burger Field for all three schools, staff, parents past and present, former pupils and friends of the school. During the year, the school celebrated with a ball, a race day, a golf day, a pageant, an arts and crafts fair, a centenary rose, basketball, cricket, hockey and rugby festivals, and multiple musical and theatrical performances. Commemorative gifts are presented by Jeppe, St Mary’s and St Stithian’s schools. The celebrations ended with a massed Carols by Candlelight service and fireworks display on Burger Field in November.\n\nThe Fred England Technology and Media Centre in the Prep opens in 1999. Sixth Form girls receive boarding. In March 2000, a move to establish St. John's College as a parish is formalised. \"Te Deum\" by , commissioned for the school’s centenary, has its world premiere. The school museum is moved to the armoury with financial assistance given by the Old Johannian Association (OJA). A strategic review is undertaken by council and senior staff which results in the following mission statement: To be a world class Christian school in Africa.\n\nIn 2001 the Centenary Venture tops R17 million. St John's College introduces a seventh house: Hodgson, a boarding house. The school has 1234 pupils with an annual budget of R44 million. The synthetic turf hockey field and the sports pavilion linking the hockey and Burger Field are completed. Sixth Form boarding school for girls is expanded with the acquisition of 14 St David Road. St. John's College and St Mary's School jointly sign a lease for Kloofwaters, an outdoor adventure camp in the Magaliesberg. St. John's College hosts three debates during the World Schools Debating Championships. Outreach continues with school support for the Yeoville Community School, Mother Theresa’s, educator workshops, the Toy Boyz project.\n\nIn 2003 The Bridge Nursery School, a partnership between St. Johns College and Roedean School, opens its doors. The actual bridge linking the two schools is constructed over Houghton Drive during the Easter weekend.\n\nToday there are five stages to a St John's education:\n\n\nThe IEB is a standardized assessment used in South Africa to test quality of schools and education. \nSt John's College was ranked 11th out of the top 100 best high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003, based upon quality of education, student engagement, strength and activities of alumni, school profile, internet and news visibility.\n\nThe college has eight college houses: Alston, Clarke, Clayton, Fleming, Hill, Hodgson, Nash and Thomson. Sir Herbert Baker designed the new Houghton school buildings and initially used rough-hewn quartzite quarried on the site, but subsequently rock was sourced from Krugersdorp and hand-chased by Maltese craftsmen. The school is arranged around a number of quadrangles, each with its cloisters. Leonard Fleming later worked with Baker on certain of the buildings.\n\nThe college has two chapels, a main one and a crypt chapel. Construction began in 1915 on the Crypt Chapel designed by Fleming as a foundation for the main chapel. The Crypt Chapel seats about 100 pupils, and is adjacent to the Garden of Remembrance. Each House of the college has a week in which it is to attend the chapel service in the crypt. Above the Crypt Chapel is the War Memorial Chapel. The superstructure was completed in June 1924 and dedicated in 1926 to commemorate staff and pupils who fell in battle. Inside the War Memorial Chapel is the Delville Wood (All Souls) Memorial Chapel, which houses one of only five Delville Wood crosses in the world, entrusted to the school by the 3rd Regiment South African Infantry. It seats about 500 pupils, including staff, and has a fully functioning pipe organ and a choir gallery at the rear of the chapel above the main entrance. Its pipe organ is the largest of its kind in South Africa.\n\n| title = Spedding's tears of joy for France\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Old Johannian Association (OJA) was created in 1903. An elected committee oversees the association and is elected every year at an annual general meeting. This committee meets monthly, and is divided into different specialized sections: finance, administration, reunions, sport and communication.\n\nAccording to the official OJA website, this association \"seeks to provide Old Johannians with social and recreational facilities for the use and benefit of all members.\" The OJA supports Old Johannian sports teams and maintains a social club for members. The OJA also funds scholarships for students of St John's College. \n\nEvents hosted and attended by the OJA include the OJ Annual Dinner, Gaudy Day and annual OJ sports events. Officers within the OJA also organize reunions for Old Johannian members.\n\n\n\n"}

One of a pair designed for hauling freight (the other, number 58 was called \"Tiger\"), built by Todd, Kitson & Laird (later Kitsons) of Leeds in 1838. It was also used in the 1953 film \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\".\n\n\"Lion\" was ordered by the Liverpool & Manchester Railway in October 1837; one of an order of six locomotives from Todd, Kitson & Laird of Leeds. They were built according to the patents of Robert Stephenson for a six-wheel locomotive and that of John Melling, the LMR Locomotive Superintendent and included several of his patent ideas, including hollow water filled firebars; a pre-heating tank beneath the firebox into which waste steam from the safety valve could be directed; Melling's patent radial valve gear; and a coupling wheel to aid adhesion. \"Lion\" and her sister \"Tiger\" were 0-4-2 'luggage' engines for working goods trains. They had cylinders 11 x 20 inches; 5-feet driving wheels; 37 inches diameter carrying wheels; and 50psi boilers 7 feet 4 inches long and slightly oval in cross section.\n\n\"Lion\" was rebuilt at Edge Hill by the LMR in 1841 with a new boiler 8 feet 6 inches long, which necessitated the building of new, longer, frames; new cylinders 12 x 18 inches; new valves and valve chests; and new valve gear as designed by William Barber Buddicom 1840-1841. \"Lion's\" present cylinders measure 14 1/8th inches x 18 inches suggesting they have been changed at a later date.\n\nIn 1845 the LMR was absorbed by the Grand Junction Railway (GJR), which in turn was one of the constituents of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) a year later. Lion was re-numbered 116 on the LNWR Northern Division.\n\nIt was used in traffic until 1857, what it was transferred to the Stores Department as Ballast Engine No. 14. \"Lion\" was sold to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in May 1859 for £400 to work the internal system of the Docks & Harbour Board in Liverpool. A new boiler - and probably the present boiler carried by the engine - was fitted by the Harbour Board in 1865.\n\nAround 1874 \"Lion\" was retired to work as a pumping engine at the Graving Dock facility at Prince's Dock which came into use in January 1875. It was \"rediscovered\" in 1923 and then rescued by members of the Liverpool Engineering Society in 1928 when it was replaced by an electric pump, and then renovated by Crewe works. Lion's tender had long since been scrapped so a new one was built by Crewe Works using parts from a scrapped Furness Railway tender, originally built by Sharp, Stewart of Manchester. Other work included: a new chimney; new smokebox doors; new wheel splashers; new foot plate and cab guard rails; new boiler lagging; new boiler tubes; the fitting of a mechanical lubricator; new boiler fittings. The cylinders were also probably re-bored. A controversial copper cover was fitted over the high-crowned wagon-top firebox to simulate an arc de cloitre firebox of the 1840s period.\n\n\"Lion\" took part in the LMR centenary celebrations in 1930 and the London and Birmingham Railway centenary in 1938.\n\nBefore World War II, \"Lion\" was displayed at Lime Street station. During the war it was stored at Crewe and afterwards displayed in the Transport Gallery of Liverpool Museum.\n\nIt starred in the 1953 film \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\", among others. During the filming of \"Thunderbolt\" the engine was fitted with a damper and a pressure gauge in order to promote better boiler management to prevent it from blowing off all the time. During filming, the buffer beam on the tender was dented, damage still visible years later. It was the second oldest locomotive to be steamed, the oldest being the British-built American locomotive \"John Bull\". The locomotive had been used in the 1951 film \"The Lady with a Lamp\", depicting the arrival of Florence Nightingale at her home.\n\n\"Lion\" was restored by Rustons Diesels Ltd. in 1979-1980. New boiler tubes were fitted; the original main steam pipe was replaced; because the original plug regulator was cracked a new one was cast and fitted; new boiler fittings including bourdon-type pressure gauge, gauge glass and try-cocks were fitted. New wash out plugs were also provided. The front buffer beam (not original) was reinforced with channel section. Safety chains were fitted and the tender equipped with air brakes taken from a commercial HGV. The boiler certificate issued by BR was for four years.\n\nWhilst the new Museum of Liverpool was being built, between 1999 and 2007 \"Lion\" was on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester alongside replica Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotive \"Planet\". It underwent a cosmetic restoration by Liverpool Museums in 2008 before going on display in the new museum.\n\nOn 27 February 2007, \"Lion\" was moved by road from Manchester to Liverpool for conservation work prior to it becoming an exhibit in the new Museum of Liverpool.\n\nIn March 2019, railway historian Anthony Dawson, who is working on a book on the locomotive, suggested that there was no clear evidence that the locomotive discovered in 1923 and now preserved as \"Lion\" is in fact Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotive 57 \"Lion\", and raised the possibility that it might be one of a number of other locomotives acquired by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board at around the same time.\n\nLondon, Midland and Scottish Railway Royal Scot Class 4-6-0 locomotive 6142 was originally named \"Lion\". This loco was built by the North British Locomotive Company at Glasgow in November 1927 and withdrawn in January 1964 as 46142 \"The York and Lancaster Regiment\".\n\nD0260, a prototype diesel locomotive built by Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company in 1962 was named \"Lion\".\n\nBritish Rail Class 08 diesel shunter 13030 (later D3030 then 08022) was sold to Guinness at Park Royal in 1985 where it was given the name \"Lion\". It and its sister locomotive \"Unicorn\" now reside on the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179310", "title": "Banstead", "text": "Banstead\n\nBanstead is a town bordering Greater London in the borough of Reigate and Banstead in Surrey, England. It is south of Sutton, south-west of Croydon, south-east of Kingston-upon-Thames, and south of Central London.\n\nOn the North Downs, it is on three of the four main compass points separated from other settlements by open area buffers with Metropolitan Green Belt status. Echoing its much larger historic area and spread between newer developments, Banstead Downs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\n\nOne of its wards is \"Banstead Village\". The civil parish was abolished when Banstead Urban District was created. Both included many outlying parts as well as the main settlement. Contiguous Nork, which contains Banstead station shares in many amenities of Banstead and is included in county-level population analyses of Banstead but not the central governmental drawn Banstead Built-up Area, which takes in Burgh Heath, and has a total population of 10,653 as at the 2011 census.\n\nAt the 2011 Census the population of Banstead (including Nork) was 16,666. The population of Banstead Village ward was 8,510 in 2001 and 9,110 in 2011. Banstead Parish now only exists for church purposes, there being no civil parish as it became Banstead Urban District which was in turn abolished in 1965. Due to the aridity of the surface of the higher south, the old parish stretched far and wide to take in the width of the widest section of the North Downs and still today Banstead is drawn more widely than its narrow village or county or borough electoral wards and divisions under three measures:\n\nTaking the last, broadest definition, in 2001, the upland settlements loosely associated with Banstead such as Tadworth had some 46,280 people across an area of approximately (four miles by four miles).\n\nThe ward of Nork includes areas which were not historically part of the hamlet of Nork. At the 2011 Census it had 7,556 residents.\n\nThe area historically had many other hamlets, which gradually gained their own village or town status; they stretched as far as Reigate across the widest part of crest of the North Downs. Thus historic demography does not give a fair indicator of population change. Identifying this swathe of land in 21st century figures with the parish, historical population growth is as follows, with parts of Walton-on-the-Hill and Chipstead included in the 2001 and 2011 wards:\n\nThe proportion of households who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of Banstead was in an Anglo-Saxon charter of AD 967, in the reign of King Edgar.\n\nThe settlement appears in the \"Domesday Book\" (1086) as \"Benestede\". The first element is probably the Anglo Saxon word \"bene\", meaning bean, and the second element \"stede\" refers to an inhabited place without town status (cf farmstead).\n\nBanstead's non-ecclesiastical land and 50 households were held by Richard as tenant-in-chief, under the Bishop of Bayeux. Its assets were: 9½ hides, 1 church, 1 mill worth £1, 17 ploughs, woodland worth 20 hogs. It rendered (in total): £8 per year.\n\nThe Manor had two ploughs, and there were 28 villeins and 15 cottars (people with a small cottage but no land) with 15 ploughs.\n\nThis was a farming area that later became well known for its high quality wool. The manor was owned by increasingly wealthy gentry, then by the church, before it fell into the hands of the Crown in the 13th century; Edward I visited more than once. Henry VIII made Banstead part of Catherine of Aragon's dowry, but took it away again and gave it to a court favourite, Sir Nicholas Carew. Carew was later beheaded for treason, but the manor, once covering most of the village but mostly sold piecemeal, stayed in his family until the 18th century.\n\nBanstead Downs, which for many centuries meant all the open land stretching from Epsom to Croydon and Reigate, became well known for horse racing in the 17th century. On 20 November 1683, King Charles II and the Duke of York attended a race meeting near the core of the village. The town also gained a reputation as a health resort during that era, becoming famous for its \"wholesome air\", and London physicians recommended a visit to Banstead to their ailing patients.\n\nBanstead's population remained low until the late 19th century when the improved roads and the building of the railways led to gradual growth, which continued with low density social housing and post-Blitz rehousing projects in the mid 20th century. Banstead's housing stock is generally low density and set in overwhelmingly green surroundings; there are a few listed buildings of some historical and architectural interest Banstead was a spring line settlement's whose main source of water was The Old Well until the arrival of pumped water. The 18th century wellhead cover which still houses the elaborate winding gear is a listed building.\n\nIn 1930, the ecclesiastical parish of Nork was formed, taking in part of Epsom as far as Wallace Fields and Higher Green in the west of the parish, loosely termed Epsom Downs.\n\nThe centre of Banstead has a High Street which stretches from the war memorial to the public library, with a churchyard on part of the south side. Scouts and Guides parade the street on Remembrance Day and May Day. On 12 December 2008, a large fire destroyed the Waitrose supermarket. While the store was being rebuilt, Waitrose operated a temporary store in the High Street, in the former Woolworths store. The rebuilt store opened on 26 November 2009. There are various restaurants and coffee bars as well as largely upmarket independent stores and the professional offices: six estate agencies, three firms of solicitors and a notary public.\n\nIn addition to employment in the retail sector in the High Street, there are a small number of public sector jobs: in the local authority offices and NHS facilities to the west of the Banstead's centre, and in various schools across the area. However, the majority of Banstead's residents commute out of the district for employment: annual exits from the town's station rose from 93,069 in the tax year 2004-05 to 128,148 in 2011-12.\n\nBanstead has several churches. All Saints' Church and Christ Church Banstead are on the high street. Within the area there is also Banstead Community Church, St Ann's Roman Catholic Church, the Methodist Church, St Paul's Church, the United Reformed Church and Crown Family Church that meets at the Banstead Community Centre.\n\nThere are several schools in and around Banstead. Further education is not available in the town, most students go to institutions in Sutton, Epsom or Reigate.\n\n\n\nNeighbouring London Borough of Sutton has five grammar schools, which accept pupils from outside the borough.\n\n\n\nMuch of the land is at about 125 m above sea level and as this descends to about 100 m it is bisected by a railway line in a relatively deep cutting.\n\nUnderneath a variable depth humus topsoil, most of the village is on various flints or chalk.\n\nForemost among the listed buildings is the Grade II-listed parish church of All Saints, made of knapped flint, partially dressed in stone, with its sturdy tower and medieval spire. It was built in the 12th and 13th centuries, and restored by George Edmund Street in 1861.\n\nThe church of All Saints was built on a site donated by Nigel de Mowbray, Lord of the Manor. The West window was designed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and produced by William Morris.\n\nThe spire of All Saints was the measuring point that was aimed at from Hounslow Heath for the base-line for calculating the precise distance and relationship between the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory. This Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) was the forerunner of the mapping of the entire country, and was led by General William Roy. A nearby viewpoint called Hundred Acres was used to make sightings south to Botley Hill, east to Upper Norwood, west to Chertsey, and so forth.\n\nThe old village well stands to the east of the town centre in Woodmansterne Lane. It is almost 300 feet (90 m) deep and was last used around the end of the 19th century. The wellhead cover dates from the 18th century and still contains the winding gear.\n\nNork Park contains the remains of the Colman family mansion (associated with Colman's Mustard).\n\nA large mound off The Drive, close to the Beacon School, is known as the Tumble Beacon. Originally a Bronze Age bowl barrow, it was enlarged circa the sixteenth century, and is believed to have been the site of one of a series of beacons/bonfires that stretched from the south coast towards London warning of the arrival of the Spanish Armada.\n\nOn the site of Downview and Highdown Prisons once stood the Banstead Asylum, a psychiatric hospital from 1873 to 1986. After being involuntarily committed to the Asylum in the late 1960s, Vincent Crane of the band Atomic Rooster wrote the song \"Banstead,\" which featured on the 1970 album \"Atomic Roooster\".\n\nBanstead Downs is a large Site of Special Scientific Interest, covering . Banstead Golf Course is on the northern slopes.\nThe Downs is one of four green areas in the north of the borough, which are overall referred to by their historic name \"Banstead Commons\"; the other three are:\n\nBanstead Downs is home to the rare Small Blue butterfly. The four tumuli (burial mounds) that can be seen on the Downs have been identified as dating from Saxon times and are known as the Gally Hills because they are the site of a 15th-century gallows.\n\nBanstead Athletic F.C play home games in Tadworth, near the town. Banstead Woods Parkrun has taken place every Saturday morning since 2007.\n\nBanstead Cricket Club have played at Avenue Road since its formation in 1842 making it one of the oldest cricket clubs in Surrey.\n\nThe Lady Neville Recreation Ground is located on Avenue Road. It is named after the wife of Sir Ralph Neville a local High Court judge who purchased the land in 1895 when it was put up for sale as building plots. The couple’s daughter, Miss Edith Neville gifted the land to the parish as a recreation ground in 1925.\n\nBanstead appears as a destination in the 1895 novel \"The Time Machine\" by H. G. Wells and also gains a brief mention in another of his novels, \"The War of the Worlds\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was partly written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson and made by Romulus Films.\n\nThe film opened at the Warner Theatre in London's West End on 14 March 1963.\n\nIn London, a gang of criminals from Australia led by Jack Coombes (Bill Kerr) impersonate policemen to carry out robberies. Local gang leader \"Pearly\" Gates (Sellers), who operates from the cover of a French couturier, finds his takings cut severely, and blames rival crook \"Nervous\" O'Toole (Bernard Cribbins). When it emerges that they are both being scammed by the same gang, they join forces, along with Lionel Jeffries' Police Inspector \"Nosey\" Parker, to bring the so-called \"I.P.O. mob\" (I.P.O. - Impersonating a Police Officer) to justice. Nanette Newman provides the love interest, John Le Mesurier plays a senior policeman, and a young Michael Caine has a small and uncredited role as a young PC.

Others in the cast are amusing, especially Mr. Jeffries as the cop, but the enterprise stands by the stiffening of Mr. Sellers's cunning roguishness.\"\n\n"}

This caught attention of Globalnet, one of the pioneering Croatian ISPs, who hired him as editor of their web portal Online.hr. Although the portal managed to attract more readership during his tenure, the portal's parent company decided to cease funding the portal in late 2001 and in December 2002 Babić left Online.hr to found Index.hr, one of the first Croatian Internet-only news outlets.\n\nInitially designed as a news aggregator, Index.hr provided news content from both Croatia and all around the world. The website quickly gained popularity in the early 2000s and over time more original content produced by the growing staff was being added to the site, until it became a popular media outlet in its own right. Around the same time the website gained a reputation for yellow journalism after exposing a series of scandals, the two most notable being the 2003 controversy stirred by a discovered recording of popular singer Marko Perković in which Perković publicly performed \"Jasenovac i Gradiška Stara\", a song praising the WWII fascist Ustaše regime, and the 2004 celebrity sex tape scandal involving Severina Vučković, a pop singer. Babić's website was sued by Vučković for copyright infringement and breach of privacy. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a Zagreb district court in July 2004.\n\nIn April 2015, along with Vana Šalov Violić, Babic was accused of damaging \"Prva stranica d.o.o.\" company for 2.8 million kunas with fictitious contracts. He pleaded guilty at county court in Zagreb and got sentenced to a year in jail. The sentence was replaced by a year of community service. Additionally, Matija Babić had to pay a fine of 300,000 kunas, while Vana Šalov Violić had to pay a fine of 150,000 kunas.

Babić left Index.hr and joined \"24sata\" which was launched in March 2005 and soon established itself as Croatia's third daily newspaper in terms of circulation, behind \"Jutarnji list\" and \"Večernji list\". However, it was also criticized for sensationalism and poor quality of writing, and Babić was sacked only four months later in July 2005, following an issue which featured a cover page with then Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and the headline \"Everybody Hates Sanader\".

{"id": "2179356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179356", "title": "Unarius Academy of Science", "text": "Unarius Academy of Science\n\nUnarius is a non-profit organization founded in 1954 in Los Angeles, California and headquartered in El Cajon, California. The organization purports to advance a new \"interdimensional science of life\" based upon \"fourth-dimensional\" physics principles. It is recorded that in 2003–4 Unarius centers existed in Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and in various locations in the United States. Membership figures are unknown.\n\nUnarius is an acronym for \"Universal Articulate Interdimensional Understanding of Science\". The founder, and subsequent \"channels\" and \"sub-channels\", have written books filled with channeled dissertations from alleged advanced intelligent beings that exist on higher frequency planes. Over 100 volumes have been published since 1954.\n\nThe group was founded in February 1954 in Los Angeles, California by Ernest L. Norman (1904–1971) and his wife Ruth E. Norman (1900–1993).\n\nFrom the period of 1954–1971, when Ernest Norman still controlled the organization, the organization defined \"the mission\" as the explanation and promotion of an interdimensional science of life in the books he wrote. He said that he had channeled the material via his psychic connections with extraterrestrial intelligences.\n\nBetween 1972–1993, while Ruth Norman guided it, the organization experienced renewed growth and public awareness. \"The mission\" became bringing Unarius to the masses. Ruth Norman granted interviews, appeared on Late Night with David Letterman and The David Susskind Show and kept very up-to-date technologically with a video production studio built in the late 1970s, when such equipment was still in its infancy. Unarius video productions began appearing on Public-access television cable TV stations all over the United States. In 2000, Diana Tumminia stated that in several cities in Southern California, the local public access channels carried weekly showings of Unarian films.\n\nUnarius has been featured in countless newspaper and magazine articles as well as radio and television spots.\n\nAfter Ruth Norman's death in 1993, Charles Louis Spiegel (also known as Antares) became director, a post he retained until his death in December 22, 1999. Since Ruth Norman's death in 1993, the organization has struggled, particularly since 2001, when a space-fleet landing predicted by Charles Spiegel in 1980 failed to occur.\n\nUnariuns believe in immortality of the soul, and that all people have reincarnated many times. They also believe that our solar system was once inhabited by ancient interplanetary civilizations.\n\nThe aliens are said to be \"human beings\" who have lived on Earth and on other planets outside our solar system. They are said to be more advanced than humans, spiritually and scientifically.\n\nWhile the group seems to have similarity to the Aetherius Society or to Raëlism, as they emphasize \"space brothers\" who will come from the stars in 33 spaceships to improve humanity, these beliefs are not held by all Unariuns and in fact, are discounted by many as contradictory to true Unariun principles.\n\nIn his book, \"The Truth About Mars\", Ernest Norman claimed that the Chinese evolved from ancient interstellar migrants who began colonizing Mars a million years ago. They are reported to have returned to Mars, where they live in underground cities, after being attacked by natives of the Earth. A group which had become separated did not return with them and this group branched off and formed the various Asian racial genotypes.\n\nErnest Norman claimed to have been a child prodigy, having read all his father's (a physician from Scandinavia) books eagerly, self-educating himself alongside his formal schooling. He also claimed that as a child, he performed to family, neighbors and teachers unexpected feats such as moving a heavy rabbit hutch using Archimedean principles and small logs, building radios and winning arguments with parents and teachers at an early age. According to Unarius, Ernest Norman was a scientist, and an aeronautical engineer from whom the idea of the television tube was stolen.\n\nClaiming to possess psychic ability, he began his metaphysical career reading palms and also claimed to have told women of their loved one's whereabouts and often deaths during the World War II years of 1942–1945. When this practice of describing fatalities allegedly lowered morale at war plants where he worked, he left and started to give lectures of his own philosophy in theosophical churches during the mid to late 1940s. Previous to meeting Ruth and the beginning of their mission, Ernest Norman gave psychic readings at spiritualist churches.\n\nRuth Norman was the oldest of eight children, born in 1900. She took many jobs early on to help support her family, and worked as a fruit packer, and at other various jobs, including as a live-in maid. Her first marriage produced a daughter. After this she worked at many jobs including store clerk, nanny, short-order cook, waitress, ran a real estate office and eventually owned and managed some property. She had purchased a motel, run a restaurant, worked at a cannery and worked in numerous other professions during her first fifty years.\n\nBoth Ernest and Ruth had experiences in Spiritualism before the UFO theme became common in the late 1940s. By the early 1950s, mystics at a psychic convention she attended told her that she was being followed around by long-bearded wise men carrying books and that she would help bring in these books in her future. This same thing had been told to Ernest by other mystics at this same convention and when the two met and later married. Books date their marriage to 1954, and their anniversary is celebrated by Unarius on February 14. Tumminia states that their union brought forth their \"mission\".\n\nWithin weeks, Ernest began to produce, by channeling, the first Unarius book, \"The Voice of Venus\". Ruth was later known within the group as both \"Ioshanna\" (1972–1979) and \"Uriel\" (1980–1993).\n\nErnest Norman became a \"channeler\", the process by which he \"wrote\" his books. Unarian channeling is a process of relaxed contemplation in which the practitioner closes the eyes and enters into a composed state, allowing thoughts and images to flow freely, as he or she voices \"messages\" received from a supposedly higher consciousness, or \"other beings\" which speak to or through him or her. Coupling \"channeling\" with \"past life\" readings, the Normans developed a devoted following.\n\nErnest Norman's first books contain themes similar to those of other metaphysical American religions and early 1950s contactees. While the Normans had dealings with other early contactee groups, initially Ernest Norman concerned himself with the \"spiritual nature\" of planets and their supposed history. He briefly mentioned flying saucers, saying that residents of more \"spiritual\" worlds were concerned about Atomic testing and responded by making their spacecraft visible and increasing contact with Earth people in order to attract attention.\n\nErnest Norman claimed to receive ‘transmissions’ from Mars and Venus, the homes of ‘great teachers’ and Ascended Masters who described their cities to him.\n\nAltogether, channeled descriptions of seven spiritual planets including Venus, claimed to be ‘advanced teaching centers’, comprise the set of books known as the \"Pulse of Creation Series\".\n\nThe Normans operated out of their home, and in the 60s and early 70s, they moved to different cities in California, eventually settling in Escondido. During that time, Norman and Ruth claimed past lives as Jesus and Mary Magdalene respectively, as well as other famous people. In 1970, Norman channeled his prime lesson book for a student of the science, \"The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation\".\n\nThe formation of the mission in February, 1954 by Ernest and Ruth Norman, led to the publication of the \"Voice Series\" of books. The first book, ‘Voice of Venus’ (1956), concerned a a psychic trip to Venus and described the advanced wonders of that civilization. Now known as ‘the Moderator’, he explained the existence of ‘healing wards’ on that planet where troubled souls go to recuperate from traumatic experiences. He explained this book was not channeled in the usual type of meditative, trance-like state or in a darkened room, but spoken normally and recorded on tape. Norman generally held modern spiritualist and theosophical movements and practices to be backwards and less enlightened. The work describes communication from Mal-Var of Venus who gives a tour of the Venusian capital. In the work, Venusians are described as having \"energy bodies\" and living in a higher vibratory plane that would be invisible to a human were he to stand in the middle of the capital city known as \"Azure\". The planet Venus and its culture are said to be more spiritual than that of the Earth and that more advanced Earth-dwellers visit and study on Venus when they sleep. Healing wards for human suicides, alcoholics, the mentally impaired and similar human wreckage exist in Azure and these souls are treated with positive energy and light to help them reincarnate with greater integration.\n\nThe Voice Series consists of seven books:\n\nThe seven books describe the seven planes of Shamballa, which are claimed to exist outside the conventional atomic spectrum and are spiritual or non-physical worlds. Each plane has a specialty in the teaching of advanced principles, for the betterment of an individual's progressive evolution from life to life.\n\nThe planes' specialties are:\n\nThese books authored by Ernest Norman, along with \"The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation\", which were a series of 13 lectures given in 1956 and later compiled into book form with seven advanced lesson courses, constitute the early teachings and beliefs of Unarius. The \"Voice Series\" books are written with famous past Earth denizens acting as the tour guides for these various planes.\n\nUnarius is an acronym which stands for \"Universal Articulate Interdimensional Understanding of Science\".\n\nUnarius, as an organization, is strongly opposed to its common classification as a religion. Unarians consider their teaching or beliefs as a science and not a religion and assert that they practice a science that teaches the 'spiritual' understanding of high energy-physics and reincarnation.\n\nSaliba points out that Unarius lacks the main elements that one normally associates with religion, e.g. a hierarchical structure, priests and clergy, initiation rites, weekly services or ceremonies. Neither do the members offer prayers to God or higher entities. Unarius feels more comfortable with the world ‘spiritual’, and admits that its teachings are ‘spiritual’ and that human beings have a spiritual nature. Notwithstanding, the beliefs of Unarius do satisfy many religious criteria in that spiritual reality is taught: humans develop their spiritual potential over lifetimes; the concept of the Space Brothers is basically a supernatural assumption as they seem different in kind, and are empirically unprovable; it involves a western concept of good and evil and an eastern concept of karma; higher entities are channeled; the texts read like sacred scriptures; its system of beliefs can explain or dispel all phenomena, and thus satisfy all questions of meaning for adherents.. Because of this many writers regard it as a religion.\n\nErnest Norman presents the case against religion in several books, most notably \"The Infinite Contact\", copyrighted in 1960, which describes in detail the origins of Christianity as rooted in Mithraism, Zoroastrianism and assorted ancient belief structures. Norman agreed with Karl Marx that religions were \"the opium of the people\", and yet also claimed to realize that many individuals were still at such a point in their evolution where religions still served a positive purpose and kept them from harming their fellowmen. Unarius calls its content and activities teaching \"interdimensional science\".\n\nUnarius was established to teach the 'fourth-dimensional science’ aka \"the Science of Life\" which incorporates harmonic frequencies, karma, reincarnation, past-life memories, channeling, and an elaborate cosmology of ‘spiritual planets.’ Central tenets of the belief system include contact with the ‘Space Brothers’ and a millenarian prophecy that predicts a mass landing of starships.\n\n\"The Science\" asserts that everything is energy: atoms, higher knowledge, our bodies and our experiences. This energy ‘vibrates in frequencies and wave forms’. ‘Understanding’ these vibrational energies allows contact with all things: higher intelligence, the ‘advanced teaching centers’ and our ‘past lives’. By being ‘in tune with spiritual frequencies’ we can heal ourselves of mental and physical illness.\n\nSaliba summarises Unarian belief under four basic themes: [1] intelligent life on other planets/galaxies; [2] an infinite creative intelligence (God); [3] that human beings are developing into an advanced state of consciousness; [4] the millennial hope of the advent of a landing. According to Unarius, the purpose of the research institution is \"to awaken the individual to previous life encounters, the clairvoyant aptitude of the mind, and the reality of one's spiritual connection.\"\n\nPracticing Unariuns hold the following beliefs:\n\nThese are the primary principles as explained by Norman in \"The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation\", Copyright 1956, 1960 Edition.\n\nFor the practicing Unariun these are the most important aspects of Unarius. Although the group is generally known for its predictions regarding flying saucers landing on Earth, Ernest L. Norman stressed these scientific core understandings as the key to personal development and mastery over material circumstances and in one instance derided flying saucer chasers as just another manifestation of people pursuing an \"escape mechanism\".\n\nWith the death of co-founder Ernest in 1971, the mission was continued by his wife and partner Ruth. New \"Sub-Channels\" now authored the books with her. The two sub-channels, Thomas Miller (Cosmon) and Louis Spiegel (Antares), are credited on a number of the organization's books starting in 1972.\n\nAfter a channeling revealed a lifetime lived in ancient Atlantis with the name \"Ioshanna\", she adopted the name \"Ioshanna\" during this period.\n\nAltogether she claimed over 200 previous lives. Much of Unarian cosmology and lore revolves around the past lives of Uriel.\n\nFrom 1954–1974, meetings were held in Ruth Norman's home or at public meeting facilities. In 1972, the channeled messages referred to \"33 worlds of an interplanetary confederation\". These worlds all had various problems and by communicating with Ioshanna, many of their hang-ups were solved or on the way to resolution.\n\nRuth became an exuberant visionary, and with help rapidly increased the ‘messages from space’. In 1973, she became known as ‘Uriel the Archangel’ said to be her ‘higher self’ and to stand for Universal, Radiant Infinite Eternal Light.\n\nIn November 1973, Uriel purchased 67 acres in Jamul, California, for a proposed landing site for the Space Brothers.\n\nIn 1974, in the \"Tesla Speaks\" volumes, Uriel completely redefined the Unarian mission by introducing the concept of the Interplanetary Confederation and the prophecy of a 33 vehicle spacefleet landing, in which she began to play the role of cosmic emissary uniting the confederation. The media joined in, the landing date was revised, and eventually pushed back to 2001. All unfulfilled prophecies were explained as being a reliving of Unarian past lives in the Isis-Osiris cycle.\n\nIn 1975, the organization moved its base from Glendale, California to El Cajon, California where a store front center was opened. Unarius was also incorporated as a non-profit, tax-exempt, educational foundation. In El Cajon, Uriel became well known for driving a blue 1969 Cadillac Coupe d’Ville adorned with airbrushed depictions of spaceships with a large metal flying saucer on the roof; the car remains with Unarius and is driven every year in the annual El Cajon Mother Goose Parade.\n\nIn 1976, ‘past life’ therapy (called ‘psychic group therapy’) became formalised as part of the curriculum, eventually became the main activity of students, and was regarded as a healing practice. The content of Unarian belief increased as these revelations evolved into collective biographies of members who are believed to have acted under Uriel on Earth and many other planets throughout millennia. Tumminia comments that this type of collective weaving of past-life narratives as a regular practice of intersubjectivity may be unique to Unarius.\n\nMost Unariuns were skeptical about the future predictions of a spacefleet landing, also channeled by Louis Spiegel. Many Unariuns felt that these predictions undermined the original mission of Ernest Norman and a falling out occurred. Circa 1980, Thomas Miller, the primary sub-channel, left the organization, leaving Louis Spiegel as the only sub-channel. From this point forward, ever more activities revolved around these predictions. Ruth Norman, now 80, participated less and less in the goings on at the center and so Unariuns turned primarily to Louis Spiegel (aka \"Antares\", \"Vaughn\" and \"Charles\") for guidance and instruction.\n\nIn the early 1970s, a \"Conclave of Light\" celebration was staged at the U.S. Grant Hotel in San Diego, California and repeated yearly at different venues, and after 1975, at the Unarius center in El Cajon, California. Every October, they stage their \"Interplanetary Conclave of Light\", which will include a visit to the Jamul landing site, the release of white doves, and 90 minutes of \"mental communication with the Space Brothers.\"\n\nIn the late 70s, Unarius started to make films and videos.\n\nUnarius generally has two types of students: the followers of Ernest Norman's original texts and works and those who believe in every channeling that occurred after his death. The latter group is often blamed by the former for the ridicule and mockery the organization has received by the general public since the early 1980s and more so in the Internet age for the conversion of the group to a \"flying saucer group.\"\n\nThe Unarius center reached its heyday in the 80s.\n\nThe early eighties brought about the development of a video production studio and the marketing of Unarius videos through public-access television cable TV channels all over the nation. From a public relations standpoint, Unarius made big inroads during this period, with new centers being opened up in the United States, Canada and Nigeria. During this period, the public identity of the organization changed from one which was teaching a \"metaphysical science of life\" to that of a \"flying saucer group.\"\n\nIn 1984, Uriel declared Spiegel to have overcome his past negative karma as the Fallen Angel, Satan, and renamed Him Antares. Subsequently, he channeled elements of the millenarian prophecy, including a new planet Myton which would send a spaceship in the year 2001 In 1984, Unarius also held its first annual Interplanetary Confederation Day (later called the Conclave of Light), which commemorates the ‘union of the planets under the guidance of Uriel'.\n\nAltogether, Uriel directed the organisation for two decades and published over 80 books.\n\nUriel broke her hip in 1988 and the next year her health began to slip.\n\nRuth Norman, after several falls and surgeries in the late eighties, had more limited physical contact with the students and members but said she was \"psychically\" communicating with them on a day-to-day basis.\n\nUriel became bedridden, rarely visiting the center herself, and let members know that her work was over. She died in 1993. Her death disconfirmed a long-held prophecy that the landing would take place in her lifetime. Her will stated that she would return with the Space Brothers in 2001. Louis Spiegel assumed leadership in the organization.\n\nAfter Ruth's death and into the 1990s, some long-term students left over disagreements with Antares. These members wished to return focus to the original teachings of Ernest Norman and the more scientific aspects of Unarius. Some students disputed the importance of Uriel and prophecies concerning her.\n\nSpiegel died in December 1999, and in 2000, a board of directors formed to guide the center. The board legitimated its cooperative authority through channeled messages, in particular from Uriel and Antares, who are now ‘Space Brothers’. Channeling ‘explained’ that the Space Brothers are actually guiding the world invisibly and cannot become visible until the world becomes less warlike. Routinisation of charisma in this organisation thus proceeded smoothly, 'channelled advice' and the invocation of 'past-life memories' confirming the need for cooperation.\n\nStudents also left or became home-study students because they disagreed with the channelings of Louis Spiegel, particularly one which claimed that it was time for Ruth, then quite ill but still living, to return to the unseen world. This was in complete opposition to previously expounded Unariun principle, wherein members, no matter how far advanced, \"never\" engaged in interfering with or predicting future human activities. Many Unariuns perceived this as a power-grab against Ruth Norman. In the belief system of the school, this was related to a \"negative reliving\" of a previous existence, creating false, negative messages.\n\nRuth Norman has been criticized for her flamboyance and costumes worn in later years. Alex Heard, in \"Apocalypse Pretty Soon: Travels In End-Time America\" , quipped of her that she was, \"a true American original who combined the couture sensibilities of a drag queen with the \"joie de vivre\" of a Frisbee-chasing Irish Setter.\"\n\nTumminia stated in the year 2000, that the local public access channels carried weekly showings of Unarian films in several cities in Southern California.\n\nWith 2001 having come and gone, and no space fleet landing having occurred, Unarius as an organization demonstrates both a returning to its roots and the principles, books and works of Ernest Norman, while simultaneously demonstrating a belief in a future landing by extraterrestrials to assist humankind. With the passing of Louis Spiegel in late 1999, the organization has formed a small council which shares leadership and management responsibilities.\n\nUnarius continues to be active both in the US and in several European countries.\n\nAccording to Zeller, the millennial aspect of Unarius reverted to a more privatised rapture-oriented mIllennialism after the death of Uriel. He stated that this more individualised approach confirms the quasi-rapture orientation of Ernest Norman.\n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WOWK-TV's studios are located on Quarrier Street near the Charleston Town Center in Charleston, and its transmitter is located in Milton, West Virginia.\n\nThe station went on-air October 2, 1955 as WHTN-TV (for HunTingtoN), an ABC affiliate owned by the Greater Huntington Theater Corporation. After only a year, the station was bought by Cowles Communications (unrelated to the Spokane, Washington-based Cowles Publishing Company). WHTN swapped affiliations with WCHS-TV and became a CBS station for the first time in 1958. In 1960, Cowles sold Channel 13 to Reeves Telecom. It went back to ABC in 1962 and stayed with that network for 24 years. Reeves Telecom sold the station to Gateway Communications in 1974. The following March, it changed its call letters to the current WOWK-TV to reflect the three states it serves (Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky). On June 1, 1986, it changed affiliations again, returning to CBS.\n\nThe station was headquartered at the Radio Center Building in Huntington from its inception until 1984 when WOWK moved to a location on Fifth Avenue. Gateway merged with SJL Broadcasting in 2000. SJL sold it to West Virginia Media Holdings in 2002. After the sale to West Virginia Media, it sold its Huntington building to regional radio conglomerate Kindred Communications and moved its studio and offices to Charleston. WOWK does retain a newsroom in their former building (now known as the Kindred Capital Building) in Huntington and its transmitter is still located at the Milton location, closer to Huntington.\n\nOn November 17, 2015, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it would purchase the West Virginia Media Holdings stations, including WOWK-TV, for $130 million. Under the terms of the deal, Nexstar assumed control of the stations through a time brokerage agreement in December 2015, with the sale of the license assets completed on January 31, 2017. Nexstar CEO Perry A. Sook was a former employee of WOWK. \n\nOn June 15, 2016, Nexstar announced that it has entered into an affiliation agreement with Katz Broadcasting for the Escape, Laff, Grit, and Bounce TV networks (the last one of which is owned by Bounce Media LLC, whose COO Jonathan Katz is president/CEO of Katz Broadcasting), bringing one or more of the four networks to 81 stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar, including WOWK-TV. (Grit was available in Charleston on WCHS-DT3 until February 28, 2017 when it was replaced by TBD. It moved to WOWK in October 2017.)\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWOWK-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, in early 2009. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 47 to VHF channel 13. On January 25, 2009, an ice storm damaged the primary analog VHF channel 13 transmitter. Rather than repair it for two more months of service, the station shut down its analog transmission early and brought its digital channel 13 transmitter on-line.\n\nWOWK-TV airs the market's only 7 p.m. newscast. The station also airs a 5 p.m. newscast. It provided weather forecasts for WVNS-TV in the Beckley–Bluefield until late 2016.\n\nOn May 16, 2011, WOWK expanded its morning newscast to a 4:30 a.m. start time. It was the first station in the market, as well as in the state, to do so.

It is part of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. Founded in 1790, St Mary's provides a range of inter-related services specifically for women and children.\n\nThe hospital was founded in 1790 by Dr Charles White in a house in Old Bridge Street, Salford, as the \"Lying-in Charity\". Five years later in 1795 the charity became the Manchester Lying-in Hospital; it was accommodated however in the Bath Inn, Stanley Street, Salford. Midwifery training for women was provided from the beginning. The building was felt to be very suitable. The bar was used as the apothecary's shop. Inpatient accommodation was available for widows, deserted wives, and those whose homes were unsuitable. 80 were admitted in 1791/92. In 1799/1800 there were 177 and 800 home patients. The charity maintained a list of midwives, who were paid two shillings and sixpence for each delivery. In 1819 it moved to smaller premises at 18 King Street Manchester, but moved back to Stanley Street in 1822.\n\nWhite's collection of 300 pathological specimens was given to the hospital after his death in 1813. It was available for inspection by the public. In 1840 the charity moved to 2 South Parade, which cost £813. There was a disastrous fire there in 1847 which destroyed most of White's collection. In 1854 it changed its name to \"St Mary's Hospital and Dispensary for the Diseases peculiar to Women and also for the Diseases of Children under six years of age\".\n\nFrom 1855 to 1903 it occupied a new building in Quay Street which was erected at the expense of Dr Thomas Radford. It cost £4300 and had 80–90 beds, 25 or 30 of which were for children. Home visiting of sick women and children, and clinical teaching of students from Owens College began at this time. Radford had joined the hospital in 1818 as a man-midwife; from 1834 he was house surgeon extraordinary; from 1841 until his death in 1881 he was the consulting physician, and from 1874 also chairman of the board of management.\n\nIn 1904 the hospital was amalgamated with the Manchester Southern Hospital for Women and Children and two new hospitals were built. One was in Whitworth Street West on the corner of Oxford Street, designed by Alfred Waterhouse and built between 1899 and 1901. It had an octagonal tower and a circular ward block on three floors of 43 feet diameter. There were three separate dining rooms – for doctors, for nurses, and for ancillary staff. The other hospital on Oxford Road in Chorlton-on-Medlock opened in April 1911. The hospital also had a School of Nursing that certified midwives. In 1910 the first female house surgeon was appointed. In 1915 the city centre hospital provided maternity and outpatient services and had 56 maternity beds and 50 cots, with accommodation for medical students, midwives and pupil nurses. The suburban hospital provided gynaecological and paediatric services and contained 115 beds.\n\nA clinic for venereal disease was opened in 1919 and ante-natal clinics were instituted in 1923. A formal co-operation arrangement was made with the Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1939 which resulted in the gynaecological department was transferred from the Infirmary to St Mary's and a shared nursing staff and training school should be instituted.\n\nDuring the Second World War most patients were moved, first to Blackpool and then to Collar House in Prestbury, Cheshire, well away from the city centre. Prestbury Hall and later Adlington Hall were also used. At the start of the NHS in 1948 it formed part of The United Manchester Hospitals.\n\nA new hospital was constructed on Hathersage Road between 1966 and 1970 at a cost of over £3 million. The wards were housed in a tower block with laboratories and the antenatal clinic in a podium. Each ward had 4 four-bedded rooms with nine single rooms, three nurseries, each with six cots, a day room and a utility room. Regional facilities – a special care baby unit, the medical genetics centre and In-Vitro Fertilisation services were developed.\n\nIn 2009 paediatric (excluding neonatal) services from St Mary's Hospital were transferred to the newly re-built Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, which opened on 11 June 2009.\n\nMore than 1,200 staff, including doctors, nurses, midwives, clinical and non-clinical support staff work in St Mary's Hospital. A range of clinical and non-clinical support services are based at the site to support the work undertaken, including well established departments of radiology and physiotherapy. 9,267 babies were delivered in 2015/16.\n\nThe Radford Library was transferred from St Mary's Hospital to the Manchester Medical Society's library in 1927. It included early obstetrical and gynaecological literature collected by the surgeon Dr Thomas Radford and donated to the hospital by him together with an endowment. Dr Radford also donated his obstetrical museum.\n\n\n"}

KWV is celebrated around the globe for its product innovation and exceptional brands, which include Roodeberg, The Mentors, KWV Brandy, Laborie, Cathedral Cellar and Classic Collection.\n\nKWV was founded as a winemaking co-operative on 8 January 1918 by wine makers from the Western Cape in South Africa, with Dr. Charles Kohler as its chairperson. The name “Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Suid-Afrika” is Afrikaans for \"Co-operative Winemakers Union' of South Africa\", but today KWV represents a well-known global wine and spirits brand producing a large portfolio of products.\n\nThe purpose of KWV was to create unity amongst the wine farmers of South Africa and to ensure continuous improvement in the quality of South African wines and brandies. From the early 1920s, the co-operative was granted increasing legislative control over the production, sale and export of South Africa's distilling wine and spirits, which allowed the body to experiment with innovations in the industry which aided its development. The organisation also invested a great deal in the promotion of South African wine and brandy both locally and abroad. KWV's legal hand over the industry was lifted with the end of Apartheid in 1990 and subsequent change in government, and in 1997 converted from a co-operative to a company structure.\n\nIn 2004, KWV negotiated the South African wine industry's largest Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) deal with Phetogo (Pty) Ltd, attaining 25.1% shares. For the first time, KWV products entered the local market with its branded wines and brandies, having previously only been available to international consumers. Today, KWV forms a subsidiary of Niveus Investments, part of the HCI black empowerment investment group, and is the only South African producer listed on Drinks International's Most Admired Wine Brands Global register.\n\nIn October 2016 KWV was acquired by the Vasari group under leadership of Mr Vivian Imerman. Based in London, Vasari is a consumer focussed investment group that acquired the operational assets of KWV for ZAR 1.15 billion.\n\nThe KWV Headquarters and main production complex are situated in the Cape Winelands in Paarl.\n\nAfter more than 100 years of unwavering passion and stoic dedication, KWV has become a brand to be reckoned with – both nationally and internationally. At KWV, the key to exceptional wine and spirits stretches far beyond sought-after grapes and vineyard sites, it’s about a narrative, individual stories and trusted intuition.  \n\nIt comes at no surprise that Drinks International named KWV the Most Admired Wine Brand from South Africa for its World’s Top 50 Most Admired Wine Brands in 2016 – and yet again in 2019. In the space of just over a century, KWV has united countless wine farmers during the industry’s fledgling years and is privileged to feature prominently in the pages of the country’s history books.\n\nFounded in 1918 by Dr Charles WH Kohler, also the birth year of iconic Nelson Mandela, KWV (Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Suid-Afrika, or Co-operative Winemakers Union’ of South Africa) remains a company that leads through innovation and quality, illustrating their relevance in the market as leaders and pioneers. Widely regarded as the twentieth century’s most important figure in the Cape wine landscape, Dr Kohler, the company’s very first chairman, saved the SA wine industry from certain ruin when he laid the foundation for KWV to become a titan in the world of wine and spirits. Kohler guided KWV for more than three decades until his death in 1952.\n\nToday, KWV is a global player in the world of wine and spirits, and testament to this, many an award received.  Only in 2019, KWV Brandy’s Centenary, the rare and once-off limited connoisseur brandy, received a near-perfect score of 99/100 in the Platter’s by Diners Club South Africa Wine Guide, while The Mentors Carmenère 2017 and The Mentors Petit Verdot 2017 respectively secured 96 and 95 points in the annual South Africa Special Report by Tim Atkin MW.\n\nWith access to 54 farms scattered across the Western Cape equating to more than 400 vineyard sites, KWV upholds a reputation for producing wines of consistent quality with innovative ingenuity. Through its varied portfolio, KWV reflects responsiveness to trends, as well as its ability to create classically structured wines that continue to stand the test of time. The company’s admired ranges include Roodeberg, Laborie, The Mentors, Cathedral Cellar and Classic Collection.\n\nMore than 80% of growers have been delivering their grapes to KWV for more than a decade – and in some instances, more than 30 years. These grapes are then expertly handled and transported to KWV’s cellar facility situated in the Cape Winelands’ town of Paarl covering approximately 32 hectares. At the heart of this facility, the world-famous Cathedral Cellar built in 1930 boasts 32 giant vats each measuring approximately three meters in circumference.\n\nIn 2018, KWV celebrated its much-anticipated centenary: A number appropriately reflected in the company’s current market standing. Its well-established roots in South Africa has penetrated international markets with a visible global footprint in 100 markets globally. And with a mantra that puts the consumer first, KWV is more than committed to another 100 years of celebrated winemaking.\n\nKWV’s Centenary, the rare and once-off limited connoisseur brandy, received a near-perfect score of 99/100 in the Platter’s by Diners Club South Africa Wine Guide on making it the highest-rated product in this year’s Platter’s 2020 guide.\n\nPlatter’s is one of South Africa’s longest standing wine guides and highlights the quality of wines and spirits determined by a seasoned group of professional tasters. Wines and spirits scored 95/100 or more are considered 5-Star.\n\nProducers who manage to secure a 5-Star rating are generally considered to represent the pinnacle of South Africa’s wine and spirits industry. Reflecting on this honour, KWV CEO Boyce Lloyd said: “KWV is exceptionally proud to stand among the Platter’s laureates for our limited-edition Centenary brandy. We were one of the first commercial distillers of South African brandy and we continue our tradition of crafting the finest brandies with pride. To be recognised by the esteemed Platter’s community in this fashion is a huge honour.”\n\nThe Centenary was crafted by KWV master distiller Pieter de Bod and his team and includes some of the very first brandy made by KWV in 1926, along with brandy from the only barrel rescued from a fire that razed KWV’s historic cellars in 1942. The balance is completed with KWV’s rarest brandies with an average maturation period of 37 years. Only 100 bottles of this limited-release brandy were launched as part of KWV’s centenary celebrations in 2018. It is the most exclusive brandy ever produced by KWV, and at a price tag of R100 000, it is also the most expensive South African brandy ever made.\n\nIt is, without a doubt, a brandy in a league of its own. This is exactly what Cape Wine Master, Winifred Bowman, who is the expert Platter’s taster assigned to KWV brandies experienced: “It is the most complex, delicate and flavourful South African brandy I have ever tasted. It has remarkable length. Pure South African sunshine in a glass. You won’t get better than this.”\n\nIn the guide, the Centenary’s score is supported with the following praise: “Combines ethereal, elegant delicacy with subtle intensity. Delectable sherry notes within its complexity, but so fresh. Mellow and deeply satisfying, reverberating endlessly.”\n\nAverage consumers not able to pay the premium price tag of the Centenary can take solace in KWV’s range of other 5-Star ratings in the Platter’s 2020 guide, which elicited similar high praise from Bowman:\n\n\nDüsseldorf, Germany, 17 March 2019 – KWV was revealed as one of the World’s Most Admired Brands in the annual The World’s Most Admired Wine Brands survey by Drinks International. Competing with the greatest names in the industry, KWV was ranked 45 out of 50, making it the highest placed brand from South Africa and one of only two South African brands to be featured in this global list.\n\nThis announcement was made in Düsseldorf, Germany, where the world’s biggest wine fair, Prowein, is currently underway. The results of the 2019 survey were revealed at a special awards evening at the five-star Steigenberger Park Hotel, where the most prestigious names in the world of wine gathered in anticipation. KWV’s Marketing Executive for Wine, Liandra Kotzé, who received the award on behalf of the company said: “It is an exceptional honour to receive this award in the presence of the most revered wine brands in the world. For KWV to be considered for this list, let alone counted among the Top 50 Most Admired Wine Brands, is a truly remarkable accomplishment. More than anything, this reflects our resolute commitment to our brands and consumers, ensuring our wines deliver consistent great experiences, never breaking the trust we have built over more than 100 years.”\n\nAccording to the editor of Drinks International, Christian Davis, “The World’s Most Admired Wine Brands aims to provide a definitive list of the world’s best wine brands, voted for by global industry experts. The list has become the most anticipated release for wine producers with the launch of the awards party a highlight of the wine industry calendar.” This is the ninth year that the results of this global survey are revealed. A brand’s ranking is made according to an ‘Academy’ of voters, consisting of wine professionals, journalists, educators and Masters of Wine. Academy members are given three votes and presented with a list of previous winners and other well-known brands and asked to vote according to wines’ consistent or improving quality, the accurate reflection of a country of origin, responsiveness to needs and tastes of its target audience, level of marketing and wide demographic appeal.\n\nLondon, July 11th 2019 – For an incredible fourth year running, KWV has been awarded the Producer of the Year Trophy in the Brandy and Cognac category at the International Spirit Challenge (ISC). This major announcement was made in addition to KWV receiving the Trophy for the Best Brandy in the World for its KWV 20 at the same competition.  KWV’s Master Distiller, Pieter de Bod, was at the prestigious awards ceremony at Plaisterers’ Hall in London, where he received these awards in the presence of the world’s leading drinks producers.\n\nThis award comes on the back of an announcement last month that KWV Brandy made history at the ISC when it claimed no less than four Double Golds for its KWV 10, KWV 20, KWV Heritage XO Cognac and KWV Imoya Cognac respectively.\n\nSuch an accolade from the ISC is regarded as the most respected and sought after in the drinks industry, due to the stringent nature of the judging process.  Winning an ISC medal is an outstanding achievement and illustrates a producer’s commitment to quality and innovation through its spirits.  This global challenge received more than 1 700 entries from the world’s leading spirits producers, from nearly 80 countries. Only 2.5% of these entrants received Trophies and Special Awards.\n\nKWV winning the 2019 Trophy for Brandy Producer of the Year in addition to its gold medal score is therefore a phenomenal accomplishment.\n\n“KWV regards the ISC as one of the most prestigious competitions of its type. The rigorous judging process is second to none and it is a remarkable achievement to garner ISC trophies and medals as this signals not only supreme quality but also consistent dedication to the craft of creating world-class spirits. We pride ourselves on our ISC accolades as they reaffirm our commitment to producing top quality spirits for our customers,” said De Bod\n\nThe coveted KWV Cruxland Gin is now the best London Dry Gin in the world – a first for South African gins. After final tastings by acclaimed judges all over the world, KWV Cruxland Gin was named the World’s Best London Dry Gin at the 2020 World Gin Awards in London on 27 February.\n\nFor the first time in history, a South African gin has secured this title. KWV’s celebrated Cruxland Gin did not only beat entries from England, the king of gin, but also France, Japan, Canada, Germany, China, Italy, Denmark, Spain, Belgium and Sweden. \n\nPresented by the popular resource for drinks professionals, The Drinks Report, the globe’s best tasting and best designed gins were announced at the Honourable Artillery Company in London during the Gin Magazine Awards Dinner. Preceding Cruxland’s announcement as overall winner for the World’s Best London Dry Gin, the brand scored a category win during the awards’ first-round results in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nAccording to Anita Ujszaszi, awards director for the World Gin Awards, over 150 gin brands from 39 countries entered this year’s London Dry Gin category. “Judges unanimously agreed that Cruxland is tremendously clean and well-balanced with a beautiful fragrance. A fantastic example of a London Dry Gin. Considering the increased number of high-quality entries, our international judging panel was very impressed.”\n\nIt’s a sentiment also shared by Kurt Schlechter, well-known South African drinks consultant. “I absolutely love the growth of gin and the simultaneous development of people’s palates. Drinking has become more sophisticated in South Africa, and we can mostly thank the gin category for that. To have an award-winning gin, you need three things: an exceptional product, passionate people and staying power. Cruxland has all of the above.” \n\nPieter de Bod, KWV Master Distiller, says the spirits team is honoured and humbled to be chosen as the World’s Best London Dry Gin. “It’s the biggest acknowledgement the distillery could have ever hoped for. London Dry Gin is one of the biggest gin categories – to win this award, beating hundreds of gins from various countries, makes this very special. Cruxland is a juniper-forward style gin using the London Dry Gin production technique – all flavours must be imparted through distillation.”  \n\nKWV CEO Boyce Lloyd comments: “We are delighted for KWV to not only lead the way within the South African gin landscape, but now the international landscape. This accolade is a testament to our spirits team’s dedication, passion, and our love for creating a unique and much-loved product. We couldn’t be more proud.”\n\nAbout KWV Cruxland Gin\n\nAt the very heart of KWV Cruxland Gin’s fragrant flair? Notes of the incredibly rare and enigmatic Kalahari N’abbas, also known as ‘Kalahari truffles’ – something gin drinkers won’t find in any other gin anywhere in the world. Once enjoyed by African royalty, this underground fungus only finds life for a limited period after the Kalahari’s desolated landscape is blessed with its first rains. The London-style Dry Gin is further infused with a total of nine exotic signature botanicals. Cruxland Gin boasts distinct earthy character, enhanced with notes of fresh juniper, lemon, coriander and spices.\n\nUsing the latest augmented reality technology, Cathedral Cellar’s new wine labels now transform into real-life impressions of the winemaker, reporting from the impressive cellar where he makes this range of wines. This is just another way this premium wine brand is finding innovative ways to share its rich storytelling heritage with wine enthusiasts.\n\nThe wine brand’s creative wine label application was unveiled at the recently concluded Prowein in Germany, where wine buyers and journalists from across the world gathered to experience the best and latest from the world of wine. The technology, developed by label print and augmented reality experts, LABELinmotion by Vollherbst, allows consumers to scan Cathedral Cellar’s new labels using a dedicated app. By hovering their phones over the Cathedral Cellar labels, consumers can watch the winemaker appear on the label, from where he provides guided wine notes on each of the wines and shares the stories that inspired them.\n\nCathedral Cellar is a premium wine portfolio by KWV and includes the Cathedral Cellar Cabernet Sauvignon, Cathedral Cellar Shiraz, Cathedral Cellar Triptych (a red blend), Cathedral Cellar Chardonnay, Cathedral Cellar Sauvignon Blanc and Cathedral Cellar Pinotage. The new labels depict the Cathedral Cellar with beautiful copper line drawings. The labels also honour the cellar’s most impressive feature: its 32 ‘stukvats’ (barrels) which measure approximately 3 meters in circumference, some of which tell the stories of the South African wine industry with intricate carvings.\n\nBrand Manager for Cathedral Cellar, Tanya Blokdyk, says that the use of augmented reality on wine labels is a relatively new development:  “we are incredibly excited to bring wine consumers an interesting way to engage with Cathedral Cellar, a brand which really is a reflection of so many beautiful elements. The cellar is a visual marvel and the winemaker is someone you would want at your dinner table. These things are difficult to capture with just a back label, but with virtual reality, people get to step into the cellar and subsequently meet Wim. It is a remarkable way to enhance the wine drinker’s journey.”\n\nMatthias Vollherbst, CEO of Vollherbst Labels in Germany who developed the augmented reality application for Cathedral Cellar, said: “It was an absolute privilege to work with such an admired brand from South Africa, and to contribute to the innovation that is happening in the country’s wine industry.”\n\n"}

Instead of using the mounted guidance system a control unit could be deployed and the missiles aimed and fired from up to 100 metres away, allowing the vehicle to remain completely hidden from the enemy; the Swingfire missile was capable of making a ninety-degree turn immediately after firing.\n\nWhen FV438s entered service in the 1970s, they were operated by specialised anti-tank units of the British Infantry and Royal Armoured Corps. In 1977, the anti-tank role was transferred to the Royal Artillery, which formed the FV438s into four independent Royal Horse Artillery batteries, one for each Armoured Division in the British Army of the Rhine. In 1984, the Royal Artillery relinquished the anti-tank role and the FV438s were formed into guided-weapon troops (each of 9 vehicles), one for each Armoured Regiment.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179398", "title": "Bear Grylls", "text": "Bear Grylls\n\nEdward Michael Grylls (born 7 June 1974), better known as Bear Grylls, is a British former SAS serviceman, survival instructor, and honorary lieutenant-colonel, and, outside his military career, an adventurer, writer, television presenter and businessman. He is widely known for his television series \"Man vs. Wild\" (2006–2011), originally titled \"Born Survivor: Bear Grylls\" for the United Kingdom release. Grylls is also involved in a number of wilderness survival television series in the UK and US. In July 2009, Grylls was appointed the youngest-ever Chief Scout of the United Kingdom and Overseas Territories at age 35, a post he has held for a second term since 2015.\n\nGrylls was born in London, England in 1974. From a family with strong cricketing background, his grandfather Neville Ford and great-great-grandfather William Augustus Ford, were both first-class cricketers. He grew up in Donaghadee, Northern Ireland until the age of four, when his family moved to Bembridge on the Isle of Wight.\n\nHe is the son of Conservative politician Sir Michael Grylls and his wife Lady Sarah \"Sally\" (née Ford). Grylls has one sibling, an elder sister, Lara Fawcett, who gave him the nickname 'Bear' when he was a week old.\n\nFrom an early age, he learned to climb and sail with his father, who was a member of the prestigious Royal Yacht Squadron. As a teenager, he learned to skydive and earned a second dan black belt in Shotokan karate. He speaks English, Spanish, and French. He is Anglican, and has described his faith as the \"backbone\" in his life.\n\nGrylls married Shara Cannings Knight in 2000. They have three sons.\n\nIn August 2015, Grylls left his young son, Jesse, on Saint Tudwal's Island along the North Wales coast, as the tide approached, leaving him to be rescued by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) as part of their weekly practice missions. Jesse was unharmed, though the RNLI later criticised him for the stunt, saying its crew \"had not appreciated\" that a child would be involved.\n\nGrylls was educated at Eaton House, Ludgrove School and Eton College, where he helped start its first mountaineering club. He studied Spanish and German at the University of the West of England, Bristol and at Birkbeck College, where he graduated with a 2:2 bachelor's degree, obtained part-time, in Hispanic studies in 2002.\n\nAfter leaving school, Grylls briefly hiked in the Himalayan mountains of Sikkim and West Bengal. From 1994–1997, he served in the British Army reserves with 21 SAS as a trooper trained in unarmed combat, desert and winter warfare, survival, climbing, parachuting, and explosives. Becoming a survival instructor, he was twice posted to North Africa. His time in the SAS ended as the result of a free fall parachuting accident the year before in Kenya, when his parachute failed to open, breaking three vertebrae.\n\nIn 2004, Grylls was awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant commander in the Royal Naval Reserve; and in 2013 he was awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Royal Marines Reserve.\n\nOn 16 May 1998, Grylls achieved his childhood dream of climbing to the summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, 18 months after breaking three vertebrae in a parachuting accident. At 23, he was at the time among the youngest people to have achieved this feat. There is some dispute over whether he was the youngest Briton to have done so, as he was preceded by James Allen, a climber holding dual Australian and British citizenship, who reached the summit in 1995 at age 22. The record has since been surpassed by Jake Meyer and then Rob Gauntlett who summitted at age 19. To prepare for climbing at such high altitudes in the Himalayas, in 1997, Grylls became the youngest Briton to climb Ama Dablam, a peak once described by Sir Edmund Hillary as \"unclimbable\".\n\nIn 2000 Grylls led the team to circumnavigate the British Isles on jet skis, taking about 30 days, to raise money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). He also rowed naked in a homemade bathtub along the Thames to raise funds for a friend who lost his legs in a climbing accident.\n\nThree years later, he led a team of five, including his childhood friend, SAS colleague, and Mount Everest climbing partner Mick Crosthwaite, on an unassisted crossing of the north Atlantic Ocean, in an open rigid inflatable boat. Grylls and his team traveled in an eleven-metre-long boat and encountered force 8 gale winds with waves breaking over the boat while passing through icebergs in their journey from Halifax, Nova Scotia to John o' Groats, Scotland.\n\nIn 2005, alongside the balloonist and mountaineer David Hempleman-Adams and Lieutenant Commander Alan Veal, leader of the Royal Navy Freefall Parachute Display Team, Grylls created a world record for the highest open-air formal dinner party, which they did under a hot-air balloon at , dressed in full mess dress and oxygen masks. To train for the event, he made over 200 parachute jumps. This event was in aid of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award and The Prince's Trust.\n\nIn 2007, Grylls embarked on a record-setting Parajet paramotor in Himalayas near Mount Everest. He took off from , south of the mountain. Grylls reported looking down on the summit during his ascent and coping with temperatures of . He endured dangerously low oxygen levels and eventually reached , almost higher than the previous record of . The feat was filmed for Discovery Channel worldwide as well as Channel 4 in the UK. While Grylls initially planned to cross over Everest itself, the permit was only to fly to the south of Everest, and he did not traverse Everest out of risk of violating Chinese airspace.\n\nIn 2008, Grylls led a team of four to climb one of the most remote unclimbed peaks in the world in Antarctica, to raise funds for children's charity Global Angels and promote the use of alternative energies. During this mission the team also aimed to explore the coast of Antarctica by inflatable boat and jetski, part powered by bioethanol, and then to travel across some of the vast ice desert by wind-powered kite-ski and electric powered paramotor. However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50 km/h (30 mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when he came down. He had to be medically evacuated.\n\nGrylls, along with the double amputee Al Hodgson and the Scotsman Freddy MacDonald, set a Guinness world record in 2008 for the longest continuous indoor freefall. The previous record was 1 hour 36 minutes by a US team. Grylls, Hodgson, and MacDonald, using a vertical wind tunnel in Milton Keynes, broke the record by a few seconds. The attempt was in support of the charity Global Angels.\n\nIn August 2010, Grylls led a team of five to take an ice-breaking rigid-inflatable boat (RIB) through of the ice-strewn Northwest Passage. The expedition intended to raise awareness of the effects of global warming and to raise money for children's charity Global Angels.\n\nGrylls' first book, \"Facing Up\" (UK)/\"The Kid Who Climbed Everest\" (US), described his expedition and achievements climbing to the summit of Mount Everest. His second was \"Facing the Frozen Ocean\". His third book \"Born Survivor: Bear Grylls\" was written to accompany the TV series of the same name. He also wrote an extreme guide to outdoor pursuits, titled \"Bear Grylls Outdoor Adventures\".\n\nIn 2012, Grylls released his autobiography, \"Mud, Sweat and Tears: The Autobiography\", followed by \"A Survival Guide for Life\" in late 2012 and \"True Grit\" in 2013.\n\nGrylls also wrote the \"Mission Survival\" series of children's adventure survival books titled: \"Mission Survival: Gold of the Gods\", \"Mission Survival: Way of the Wolf\", \"Mission Survival: Sands of the Scorpion\", \"Mission Survival: Tracks of the Tiger\" and \"Mission Survival: Claws of the Crocodile\". He has written two thriller novels based around his character Will Jaeger; Ghost Flight released in 2015 and Burning Angels in 2016.\n\nIn 2019, Grylls published a Christian devotional titled \"Soul Fuel\".\n\nGrylls entered television work with an appearance in an advertisement for Sure deodorant, featuring his ascent of Mount Everest. Grylls was also used by the UK Ministry of Defence to head the Army's anti-drugs TV campaign, and featured in the first ever major advertising campaign for Harrods. Grylls has been a guest on numerous talk shows including \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\", \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", \"Attack of the Show!\", \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"Harry Hill's TV Burp\". Grylls recorded two advertisements for Post's Trail Mix Crunch Cereal, which aired in the US from January 2009. He also appeared as a \"distinguished instructor\" in Dos Equis' \"Most Interesting Academy\" in a webisode named \"Survival in the Modern Era\". He appeared in a five-part web series that demonstrates urban survival techniques and features Grylls going from bush to bash. He also has marketed the Alpha Course, a course on the basics of the Christian faith. In 2013, Grylls appeared in an airline safety video for Air New Zealand entitled \"Bear Essentials of Safety\", filmed against the backdrop of the Routeburn Track on the southern tip of New Zealand's South Island. In 2014, Grylls appeared on \"Piers Morgan's Life Stories\".\n\nGrylls filmed a four-part TV show in 2005, called \"Escape to the Legion\", which followed Grylls and eleven other \"recruits\" as they took part in a shortened re-creation of the French Foreign Legion's basic desert training in the Sahara. The show was first broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, and in the US on the Military Channel.\n\nGrylls hosts a series titled \"Born Survivor: Bear Grylls\" for the British Channel 4 and broadcast as \"Man vs. Wild\" in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, and the United States, and as \"Ultimate Survival\" on the Discovery Channel in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The series features Grylls dropped into inhospitable places, showing viewers how to survive. \"Man vs. Wild\" debuted in 2006, and its success led it to lasting seven seasons over five years.\n\nThe show has featured stunts including Grylls climbing cliffs, parachuting from helicopters, balloons, and planes, paragliding, ice climbing, running through a forest fire, wading rapids, eating snakes, wrapping his urine-soaked T-shirt around his head to help stave off the desert heat, drinking urine saved in a rattlesnake skin, drinking fecal liquid from elephant dung, eating deer droppings, wrestling alligators, field dressing a camel carcass and drinking water from it, eating various \"creepy crawlies\" [insects], using the corpse of a sheep as a sleeping bag and flotation device, free climbing waterfalls and using a bird guano/water enema for hydration.\n\nThe show caused controversy after a programme consultant revealed that Grylls actually stayed in a hotel on some nights – including an episode in Hawaii in which Grylls was ostensibly stranded on a deserted island – and that certain scenes were staged for him. Grylls subsequently apologized to viewers who might have felt misled.\n\nIn March 2012, the Discovery Channel dropped Grylls from its lineup because of a contractual dispute, although he has subsequently worked with them again.\n\nIn August 2019, Bear Grylls appeared with Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi in a special episode shot in the India's Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand. The episode was showcased in more than 180 countries across the world on the Discovery, Inc. network.\n\nIn 2010, Grylls came out with a new project titled \"Worst-Case Scenario\" which aired on Discovery in the US. It is based on the popular books of the same name. Twelve episodes were produced before the show was cancelled.\n\nIn 2011, he made two specials under the title \"Bear’s Wild Weekend\" for Channel 4 in the UK which was broadcast over the Christmas holiday that year. Each special featured Grylls taking either Jonathan Ross or Miranda Hart on short two-day adventures; Ross to rainforest in the Canary Islands, Hart to the Swiss Alps. These screened in the US under the title \"Bear Grylls' Wild Adventure\". A third episode with Stephen Fry, this time in the Dolomite mountains of South Tyrol, screened in late 2013.\n\nIn 2014, two further episodes were aired in the UK under the title \"Wild Weekends\". The first of these was the 2011 special of \"Man vs. Wild\" featuring Jake Gyllenhaal, and the second was the \"Running Wild\" episode featuring Ben Stiller.\n\nGrylls hosted \"Get Out Alive with Bear Grylls\", a reality competition series filmed in New Zealand, which premiered on NBC on 8 July 2013.\n\nIn \"Bear Grylls: Escape from Hell\", he reveals the true life stories of ordinary people trapped in extraordinary situations of survival.

Filming started in August 2015. The series began airing on 10 January 2016. A second series was scheduled to begin on 7 January 2017.\n\nIn summer 2015, China's Dragon TV ordered a Grylls-fronted adventure series titled \"Survivor Games\" (Chinese: 跟着贝尔去冒险). The series featured Grylls and eight Chinese celebrities and premiered on Dragon TV on 16 October 2015.\n\nIn 2018, ITV began airing a new series similar to the USA series \"Running Wild with Bear Grylls\" called \"Bear's Mission with...\". This show focuses on one British celebrity taking an overnight adventure with Bear each episode. The series premiered on ITV on early 2018.\n\nLater, Grylls went on to release an interactive series on streaming service Netflix.\n\nOutside of TV, Grylls works as a motivational speaker, giving speeches worldwide to corporations, churches, schools, and other organisations.\n\nOn 17 May 2009, The Scout Association announced Grylls would be appointed Chief Scout following the end of Peter Duncan's five-year term in July 2009. He was officially made Chief Scout at Gilwell 24 on 11 July 2009 in a handover event featuring Peter Duncan in front of a crowd of over 3,000 Explorer Scouts. He is the tenth person to hold the position and the youngest Chief Scout since the role was created for Robert Baden-Powell in 1920.\n\nOn 9 April 2015, The Scout Association announced that Grylls would continue as Chief Scout until 2018. Grylls wrote, \"I am so proud that the largest youth movement on the planet has asked me to continue in my role as UK Chief Scout.\"\n\nOn 5 June 2015, Grylls, in an interview with \"The Telegraph\", praised the challenge of being Britain's youngest Chief Scout, saying \"Scouting humbles me every day\".\n\nBear Grylls Ventures and NM Capital purchased British Military Fitness in September 2018 and re-branded as \"Be Military Fit with Bear Grylls\", to retain the existing acronym BMF. The company runs outdoor group fitness classes in 140 public parks and outdoor spaces across the United Kingdom. The classes are led by former or serving members of the British Armed Forces with recognised fitness training qualifications. It is Europe's largest outdoor fitness company.\n\nGrylls is an ambassador for The Prince's Trust, an organisation which provides training, financial, and practical support to young people in the United Kingdom.\n\nGlobal Angels, a UK charity which seeks to aid children around the world, were the beneficiaries of his 2007 accomplishment of taking a powered para-glider higher than Mount Everest. Grylls' held the highest ever dinner party at in aid of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, and launched the 50th anniversary of the Awards. His successful circumnavigation of Britain on jet skis raised money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.\n\nGrylls' Everest climb was in aid of SSAFA Forces Help, a British-based charitable organisation set up to help former and serving members of the British Armed Forces and their families and dependents. His 2003 Arctic expedition detailed in the book \"Facing the Frozen Ocean\" was in aid of The Prince's Trust. His 2005 attempt to para-motor over the Angel Falls was in aid of the charity Hope and Homes for Children.\n\nIn August 2010, Grylls continued his fund-raising work for Global Angels by undertaking an expedition through the Northwest Passage in a rigid inflatable boat.

I have never been a good quitter and I am so proud of the UK and our values: tolerance, kindness, respect, courage and resilience. This is why I want us to stay together and Remain in Europe.\" In January 2020, he announced that he had asserted his right to Irish citizenship and had obtained an Irish passport.\n\nGrylls was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to young people, the media and charity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179403", "title": "Undie 500", "text": "Undie 500\n\nThe Undie 500, originally named the Under 500, was an annual student-run car rally between Christchurch and Dunedin, New Zealand with multiple stops at drinking establishments along the way. The name comes from the original rule that a vehicle is purchased for less than NZ$500, and optionally decorated.\n\nThe event has run since the early 1980s and is organised by the University of Canterbury Engineering Society Inc. (ENSOC). The premise of the event is for student members of ENSOC to purchase and decorate a vehicle before rallying the cars to Dunedin. The vehicles are individually themed and occupants pub crawl over the entire day of driving. This event is characterised by the high level of work performed on the entrants' cars; transforming them from normal motor vehicles into something unique.\n\nThe event was originally to coincide with the weekend of the annual Canterbury University Engineers v Otago Surveyors rugby match. At this time and well into the 1990s it was known as the \"Under 500\". Somewhere along the way it has been transformed into the \"Undie 500\", presumably to establish a similar-sounding name to the more famous Indy 500.\n\nSince 2003, the number of vehicles was limited to 150. The event used to attract more than 1,000 participants and thousands of spectators. The event was widely reported, attracting national TV news coverage, newspaper, radio and has even featured in \"Ralph\" magazine. The New Zealand Police accompany the convoy throughout the trip to ensure both the safety of participants and other road users.\n\nSince 2006, when others driving cars not associated with the event began traveling to Dunedin concurrently and rioting, the event has also received much negative publicity due to rioting students and others associated with the event. Some have been charged with offenses including offensive language and breaching the liquor ban the Dunedin City Council had placed.\n\nAfter the 2009 event, the head of the University of Canterbury Students' Association (UCSA) noted that they could not \"exert authority on those hangers-on or those other students and young people that head to Dunedin to use this as an excuse for violence or anti-social behaviour.\", and that it was no longer in the interest of students to be associated with those who were causing trouble after the event. Consequently, the 2009 head of the UCSA predicted ENSOC could not run a further event to Dunedin in light of the trouble that would be caused by those non-students who would use it as an excuse for violence and other anti-social behaviour, but appeared not to rule out a similar event heading to a different destination.\n\nMany in Dunedin see the event as having been sensationalised by the media, with one local noting the \"local newspaper will start printing stories a week in advance, and will continue for a week after the event, even if it runs smoothly.\"\n\nCars were expected to meet the following requirements:\n\nIn previous years it was also a requirement to have a vehicle under the price of $500, hence the name UNDIE 500. However, due to rising prices and stricter regulations this rule was later overlooked.\n\nBefore embarking for Dunedin, cash prizes were awarded for outstanding entries including:\n\nThe winner of best dressed vehicle in 1994 was a 1964 HD Holden Special station wagon cleverly transformed into Thomas The Tank Engine. It featured in an article on the Under 500 in The Timaru Herald newspaper. That year there was a bad snow storm on The Kilmog hill, just north of Dunedin. The local police stopped many of the cars on their way up the hill due to the icy conditions. This vehicle was allowed through as it was explained to the officer, \"This is a train, not a car\".\n\nThe 2006 event was marred by drunken rioting in the Castle St area of Dunedin; resulting in 30 arrests and a liquor ban subsequently imposed on the main student area over the events weekend. After the incident ENSOC worked with the various local authorities in Ashburton, Timaru, Oamaru and Dunedin to minimise any possible disruption caused to local residents, including paying the Dunedin City Council to tow away any abandoned vehicles.\n\nIn 2007 the event saw further drunken rioting in which 69 people were arrested, on a night which one student involved described it as \"a usual Dunedin Saturday night\", while Dunedin emergency service workers said it was the city's worst trouble for many years. Crowd estimates were 1,000 – 2,000 at the height of the riots. Couches, a mattress and at least two Undie 500 cars were torched on Castle, Dundas, Hyde, Grange, and Leith streets, and police and fire-fighters were pelted with bottles. 9 of the 24 University of Canterbury students arrested were officially registered on the Undie 500, along with 30 Dunedin students and 15 non-students. Subsequently, there have been calls for an end to the event, with the Mayor of Dunedin Peter Chin calling the event 'history'.\n\nIn response to the rioting, police upgraded charges from disorderly behaviour to the more serious crime of rioting for 21 of the 69 arrested people, which could have resulted in up to 2 years in prison. These charges were later dropped by the police, with ten offenders pleading guilty and six pleading not guilty to lesser offences, resulting in at least one conviction for fifteen people. Furthermore, University of Otago students involved in the rioting also risked being expelled from the university. 31 people were charged at the Dunedin District Court, 22 being convicted (9 on two charges), and 5 receiving diversion. One charge of disorderly likely to cause violence was upheld on appeal to the High Court. The people convicted were forced to pay fines, reparations, donations and court costs exceeding $16,500 (up to $2,000 for some individuals), and received 250 hours community service, in addition to lawyers fees estimated at up to $1,000 to $5,000 each.\n\nChin later said he expected the event would go ahead for 2008, though he soon pulled out of meetings with ENSOC and emergency services. ENSOC had submitted a management plan with bonds and behavioural guarantees for participants, and had planned for a concert for the Saturday night after the official event, which has been the scene of the rioting in recent years. Meetings had been held with concert promoters with the aim of organizing a large event with a budget of over $100,000. Without approval, ENSOC are refusing to condone the 'underground' Undie 500 that they expect to occur.\n\nIn 2008 the official event was cancelled, but around 100 students from the University of Canterbury travelled to Dunedin in about 40 cars and vans. More than 100 police were rostered on for the event, and had placed checkpoints on the outskirts of Rolleston and the entrance to Dunedin city. The media once again reported the event sparked violence, with police in full riot gear three times charging a group of around 500 students throwing rocks and bottles, before dispersing the crowd in the early hours of 24 August 2008. While police Inspector Dave Campbell noted that the event was not a catalyst for the trouble, with most of those arrested from Otago University or non-students, he also said that to those persons \"It's quite clear that it [the Undie 500] is seen as a magnet.\" Around 30 arrests were made, in addition to 3 University of Canterbury and 2 University of Otago students from the previous night.\n\nAn official ENSOC charity event ran in 2009, after Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin refused to negotiate with the University of Canterbury Students Association and ENSOC to organise events after the main Undie rally to minimise disorder afterwards. About 600 students from Canterbury participated, bringing more than 1000 cans of food for Dunedin food banks. The \"Undie Charity Drive\" has been criticised by Chin as \"no matter how it is dressed up it is just a pub crawl.\" While the rally featured decorated cars, costumes and alcohol, new measures such as a good behaviour bond were introduced to address previous concerns. These measures, could, however, only be used to control behaviour by Canterbury University students, not Otago University students or the unemployed.\n\nOamaru, through which the event passes, was \"proactive\" (according to their community constable), and organised to deal with any increased littering or other anti-social behaviour as a result of the event. The town experienced no major problems, with only two arrests.\n\nThe event ran successfully, with partying afterwards becoming chaotic as police in riot gear moved in to be pelted with bottles, bricks and bicycle parts. Over two nights 80 arrests were made – around 80% University of Otago students, 10% University of Canterbury students, and 10% not students. In response to the disorder, Chin blamed Christchurch students. Police charged 67 people with a range of offences including breaching the temporary liquor ban, disorderly behaviour, obstruction and burning couches. Prime Minister John Key described the incident as \"madness\" and pointed out some students would consequently graduate with criminal convictions.\n\nIn the aftermath, OUSA president Edwin Darlow pointed out that as there was no way to stop the event, the council should consider alternative events over the weekend to reduce disorder after it finishes, though Chin has consistently refused to consider options ENSOC has proposed. Bystanders complained of being pepper sprayed by police in their own doorways. An 18-year-old Telford Rural Polytechnic student who travelled from Balclutha, specifically to be part of the \"Undie 500 weekend\", fell onto a burning couch while trying to jump over it. He was taken to Dunedin Public Hospital suffering burns, and required surgery.\n\nIn response to the event police minister Judith Collins said on 3 News the rioters were \"spoilt little rich kids, who think that they are going to be the future leaders of our country, and frankly if they are, God help us\".\n\nCharges against two of those arrested were withdrawn because police lacked valid evidence. On 14 September, the first three of those arrested appeared in court; one a Dunedin student, and two unemployed and employed persons respectively from Dunedin. The day after, a mill-hand and a process worker were convicted of breaching the liquor ban. Of those facing charges, 43 are tertiary students. The largest group was of 27 Otago University students, followed by 18 who are not tertiary students, six of whom were unemployed. On the 18th, one Otago student was convicted of theft for grabbing a police officers hat, valued at $80, for which he would later apologise to the officer. He was fined $500 with court costs of $130. Also convicted were two unemployed men and a shearer.\n\nThe harshest penalty imposed has been on a 41-year-old unemployed Dunedin man for breaching the City Council liquor ban. Eight people have had charges against them dropped for lack of evidence against them, and two discharged without conviction. One Dunedin student was suspended from the University for swearing at Dunedin University security staff, outside the University property, outside his flat.\n\nIn the year 2010 the Undie 500 Charity Drive was denied a liquor licence for an event that included a concert in Seddon. This was a blow to the event as it eventually led to the charity drive being cancelled in 2010. The committee ended up spending funds set asides on helping relief efforts for the Canterbury earthquake.\n\nAfter several meetings between event organisers ENSOC, the Dunedin police, Christchurch and the Dunedin city council the event was organised as a pub crawl that left from the university and returned to Christchurch. The event was kept off Facebook and the ENSOC website in an effort to keep it out of the media's attention, removing the negative publicity that is normally associated with the event.\n\nThe event consisted of leaving from the university arts car park, as in previous years, then heading out to the first pub in Yarldhurst. Both the participants and police were well behaved. Following that the event continued further out on to the Canterbury plains, finally ending back at a pub in Templeton, just out of Christchurch.\n\nThe name Undie 500 was revitalised in 2017 by former University of Otago student Ryan Hellyer, who created the new annual Undie 500 event as a special event for the Undiecar Championship, a sim racing series run on the iRacing platform. The most recent event in 2018 attracted 33 competitors.\n\n\n"}

Topographical Poem]\n\nA different translation is \"Finne's weir\".\n\nThe town is sometimes spelled \"Corrofin\". Corofin also styles itself as \"The Gateway to the Burren\" or \"The Angler's Paradise\".\n\nThe village is north of the county town of Ennis, at the crossroads of the R460 and R476 regional roads. It is on the southern edge of the upland limestone region of The Burren. Corofin is in the civil parish of Kilnaboy in the Barony of Inchiquin.\n\nIt lies in the Kilnaboy parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The parish has three churches, St Brigid's in Corofin, St Joseph's in Kilnaboy and St Mary's in Rath.\n\nCorofin is the childhood home of painter Frederick William Burton.\n\nOn Church Street is the former Church of Ireland, \"St. Catherine's Church\", built between 1715 and 1720 by Catherine Kneightly. It was renovated c. 1820 and by 1829 the steeple had been added. The building is now in use by the Clare Heritage and Genealogical Research Centre.\n\nAn Irish National Monument, the Cross Inneenboy, also known as Roughan Hill Tau Cross, is a stone tau cross which has been moved into the centre for safe keeping.\n\nInchiquin Castle is located on the north side of Lake Inchiquin (in the parish of Kilnaboy). It was possibly begun by Teige-an-Chomhaid O'Brien (d. 1466). In 1542, it belonged to Turlough, son of Murrough, first Baron of Inchiquin. Murrough O'Brien, the fourth Baron, was in possession in 1580. His descendants, the Marquesses of Thomond, derived their title of Earl of Inchiquin from this estate. During the Nine Years' War, Hugh Roe O'Donnell raided Clare and Inchiquin Castle was attacked by one of his lieutenants, Maguire of Fermanagh. During the Confederate Wars Christopher O'Brien, Murrough the Burner's brother, lived here. Murrough's son, Colonel John O'Brien, abandoned Inchiquin towards the end of the 17th century. By then it had deteriorated into a ruin. Today the castle remains a ruin surrounded by pastures. Part of the older castle tower is still extant as is a good portion of the later 17th-century banquet hall.\n\nCorofin is twinned with Tonquédec in France.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179413", "title": "Cray Plaza", "text": "Cray Plaza\n\nCray Plaza (formerly Galtier Plaza), located in the Lowertown neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, provides space for working, living, eating, and recreating on one square city block opened in 1986.\n\nFeatures include 365 apartments, 121 luxury condominiums, 16 townhomes, a YMCA facility, of retail and restaurant space, of office space, and a 5-level underground parking garage for 829 cars.\n\nAt that time the Lowertown Redevelopment Corporation, a non-profit coordinator of development in St. Paul's historic warehouse district, had sought to fill Block 40 for some three years. The site on Mears Park just east of the downtown business district represented the keystone in Lowertown's revitalization, and Lowertown Redevelopment Corporation's executive director Weiming Lu had persuaded developers with the concept of a mixed-use development and one tenant, the downtown YMCA.\n\nEfforts to put together a project reusing existing properties on the block had fallen through, as had a modest proposal for housing and service retail by the Carley Capital Group of Madison, Wisconsin. The city had already secured an Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) from the federal government for the Carley development, and called for new developers with a three-month deadline looming. Boisclair and Omni Venture, Ltd. the developers of Minneapolis' International Market Square, responded. Robert Boisclair took on the development.\n\nMiller, Hanson, Westerbeck & Bell were selected as architects for the project. They had done studies of Block 40 for the Lowertown Corporation and had a history of designing housing for Boisclair which included Lakepoint Tower and the Falls and Pinnacle at Riverplace. Galtier Plaza was named after Father Lucien Galtier, a Roman Catholic priest who has historical involvement with the founding of the city of St. Paul.\n\nThe location and form of the architectural elements was the subject of negotiation between the developer, the city and Lowertown Corporation. In addition, the financial partnerships involved in the project had to be expressed architecturally so that ownership of the complex space could be divided by multiple tenants.\n\nThe six-story base along the street front was needed to maintain the cornice of the surrounding six-story buildings was dictated by historic and design considerations. The decision to fill out the block to the maximum met economic goals. The housing, proposed as one corner tower cascading to the base, was instead split between two towers. The taller one, the Jackson Tower, falls just under Federal Aviation Administration limits at . The lower one, the Sibley Tower, is located back of the Mears Park facade.\n\nThe atrium beginning at the building line, became instead a gabled roof extruded beyond the building facade and stepping back to its seven-story peak. The developer wanted it to be wide but it was narrowed to 90 feet. The skyway linking Galtier Plaza and the Farm Credit Bank toward downtown was proposed as a \"festive\" design with gabled peaks, lots of glass, and cream and red aluminum trim to match Galtier's. Lowertown's Weiming Lu and the city planning staff stood fast for the standard Vierendeel truss and bronze aluminum. Galtier Plaza opened in 1986.\n\nThe project cost at least $140 million to build, not including the YMCA and other portions. Various parts of the project were funded separately. The rental apartments were funded by bonds sold through the Port Authority to private institutional investors; the YMCA was on a separate parcel; and much of the other private funding came from investors as equity and from Chemical Bank as a loan. There were issues with construction, cost overruns, inadequate financial resources, high interest rates, delays, and strategic errors made in market analysis and design.\n\nAs the project was delayed, it found difficulty attracting tenants. Eventually, private investors are said to have lost about $42 to $45 million in equity and Chemical Bank is said to have lost about $90 million on their loan. The Port Authority took over the rental apartments after the default on that part of the project—for which they had loaned $32 million and which would have cost about $36 million.\n\nExcluding the YMCA, rental housing, and the energy plant, the balance of the project (retail, offices, condos, and the parking garage) was sold in 1989 to a Canadian investor in the range of $10 to $12 million.\n\nHenry Zaidan's thought to market the condos, and to reposition the retail space from the regional high end target and toward services for the neighborhood and downtown. He relocated the food court to the ground level. After filling the vacant retail and office space during the recession, Zaidan left the Galtier Plaza project in 1992, and in 1996 the holder of the mortgage obtained title through foreclosure, changed the management company and made some nominal improvements before selling Galtier in 1999 to an investor group managed by Wasmer, Schroeder & Company.\n\nThe Wasmer group invested in an extensive remodeling project, including conversion of much of the vacant retail space into office space. The residential towers at Galtier were sold to Bigos Investments, owned by Ted Bigos, in 2003, and the Wasmer group sold the commercial and parking facilities in 2006 to a group based in California. The commercial portion of Galtier now contains several restaurants, a convenience store, a conference facility, and a credit union, Unity One Credit Union. Retail and office space are about 85% occupied.\n\nOver the years, the building has seen erratic success, first as a shopping mall, then as an entertainment center, and currently is most notably occupied by a private preparatory academy, various technology companies, an event and presentation facility (carved out of the old movie theaters), a restaurant, and a food court.\n\nIn the summer of 2009 it was announced that the naming rights to Galtier Plaza had been purchased, and the building would become known as Cray Plaza, as the building's new \"anchor\" tenant was Cray Inc. The complex won the award for the first place design award excellence from Development Design Group, First Place from National Mall Monitor Center's of Excellence, and Signs of the Times award for electric sign graphics.\n\n\n\n"}

The force's headquarters were in Fettes Avenue, Edinburgh.\n\nLothian and Borders Police was formed on 16 May 1975 by an amalgamation of Berwick, Roxburgh and Selkirk Constabulary, Edinburgh City Police and The Lothians and Peebles Constabulary.\n\nThe force had 2,905 officers and 1,384 support staff as of March 2008. The force's last Chief Constable was David Strang who replaced Paddy Tomkins on 29 March 2007.\n\nAn Act of the Scottish Parliament, the \"Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012\", created a single Police Service of Scotland—known as Police Scotland—with effect from 1 April 2013. This merged the eight former regional police forces in Scotland (including Lothian & Borders Police), together with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, into a single service covering the whole of Scotland. Police Scotland has its headquarters at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan in Fife.\n\nThe Lothian and Borders Police area stretched from Blackridge in the west to Newcastleton in the south. It was split into four territorial divisions, and several other non-territorial divisions for specialist and administrative roles.\n\nA Division covered the City of Edinburgh, and was created in 2002 following the amalgamation of the City of Edinburgh's three previous divisions. It was the largest territorial division in terms of manpower and population. Its headquarters were St Leonards Police Station.\n\nE Division covered East Lothian and Midlothian, stretching from the Edinburgh City Bypass to Dunbar in the east. Its headquarters were in Dalkeith.\n\nF Division covered West Lothian with its headquarters in Livingston. The division's officers were sometimes referred to as \"F Troop\", although this was regarded as offensive as \"F Troop\" was originally a comedy set in the old west of America (first shown 14 September 1965) that followed a group of misfit cavalrymen in the U.S. Army.\n\nG Division was the largest territorial division in Lothian and Borders Police and covered the Scottish Borders. It was approximately twice the size of all the other divisions combined, bordering England in the south. It covered a predominantly rural area featuring rolling country side and isolated population areas. Its headquarters were in Hawick.\n\nC Division (Corporate Services) comprised such departments as Corporate Communications, Safer Communities, Complaints and Conduct and Business Improvement.\n\nH Division was concerned with Personnel and Human Resources functions.\n\nJ Division was concerned with Secondments.\n\nN Division was styled the \"Criminal Justice Administration Department\".\n\nO Division (Operations) provided specialist operations support to the force. It was predominantly made up of the Roads Policing Units (traffic) which were based at the headquarters of each division. They also provided specialist Firearms and Public Order (Riot Police) support to all divisions. Also within O Division were the forces Dog Handlers. O Division also included The Force Communications Centre (FCC).\n\nP Division was responsible for training and career development. Training of probationary constables was carried out jointly by the Scottish Police College based at Tulliallan Castle, \"on the job\" in the force area. Officers transferring from other Scottish forces were not required to attend the college, unlike those transferring from the rest of the United Kingdom, who were required to attend a conversion course to allow for adjustment to Scots law.\n\nS Division was responsible for the financial management of the force.\n\nX Division provided investigative support to the entire force. While detectives may have been allocated to assist other divisions as their main role as detectives, they could be pooled to provide assistance whether their specialist skills are required.

Supersecondary structures can act as nucleations in the process of protein folding.\n\nA helix hairpin, also known as an alpha-alpha hairpin, is composed of two antiparallel alpha helices connected by a loop of two or more residues. True to its name, it resembles a hairpin. A longer loop has a greater number of possible conformations. If short strands connect the helices, then the individual helices will pack together through their hydrophobic residues. The function of a helix hairpin is unknown; however, a four helix bundle is composed of two helix hairpins, which have important ligand binding sites.\n\nA helix corner, also called an alpha-alpha corner, has two alpha helices almost at right angles to each other connected by a short 'loop'. This loop is formed from a hydrophobic residue. The function of a helix corner is unknown.\n\nThe helix-loop-helix structure has two helices connected by a 'loop'. These are fairly common and usually bind ligands. For example, calcium binds with the carboxyl groups of the side chains within the loop region between the helices.\n\nThe helix-turn-helix motif is important for DNA binding and is therefore in many DNA binding proteins.\n\nA beta hairpin is a common supersecondary motif composed of two anti-parallel beta strands connected by a loop. The structure resembles a hairpin and is often found in globular proteins. \n\nThe loop between the beta strands can range anywhere from 2 to 16 residues. However, most loops contain less than seven residues. Residues in beta hairpins with loops of 2, 3, or 4 residues have distinct conformations. However, a wide range of conformations can be seen in longer loops, which are sometimes referred to as 'random coils'. A beta-meander consists of \"consecutive\" antiparallel-beta strands linked by hairpins.\n\nTwo residue loops are called beta turns or reverse turns. Type I' and Type II' reverse turns occur most frequently because they have less steric hindrance than Type I and Type II turns. The function of beta hairpins is unknown.\n\nA beta hairpin has two antiparallel beta strands that are at about a 90 degree angle to each other. It is formed by a beta hairpin changing direction with one strand having a glycine residue and the other strand having a beta bulge. Beta corners have no known function.\n\nA Greek key motif has four features:\n\n\nThe Greek key motif has its name because the structure looks like the pattern seen on Greek urns. This motif has no known function.\n\nβ-sheets (composed of multiple hydrogen-bonded individual β-strands) are sometimes considered a secondary or supersecondary structure.\n\nA beta-alpha-beta motif is composed of two beta strands joined by an alpha helix through connecting loops. The beta strands are parallel, and the helix is also almost parallel to the strands. This structure can be seen in almost all proteins with parallel strands. The loops connecting the beta strands and alpha helix can vary in length and often binds ligands.\n\nBeta-alpha-beta helices can be either left-handed or right-handed. When viewed from the N-terminal side of the beta strandes, so that one strand is on top of the other, a left-handed beta-alpha-beta motif has the alpha helix on the left side of the beta strands. The more common right-handed motif would have an alpha helix on the right side of the plane containing the beta strands.\nRossman folds, named after Michael Rossman, consist of 3 beta strands and 2 helices in an alternating fashion: beta strand, helix, beta strand, helix, beta strand. This motif tends to reverse the direction of the chain within a protein. Rossman folds have an important biological function in binding nucleotides such as NAD within most dehydrogenases.\n\n"}

The aircraft has distinct wing and body structures, which are smoothly blended together with no clear dividing line. This contrasts with a flying wing, which has no distinct fuselage. A BWB design may or may not be tailless.\n\nThe main advantage of the BWB is to reduce wetted area and the accompanying form drag associated with a conventional wing-body junction. It may also be given a wide airfoil-shaped body, allowing the entire craft to generate lift and thus reducing the size and drag of the wings.\n\nThe BWB configuration is used for both aircraft and underwater gliders.\n\nIn the early 1920s Nicolas Woyevodsky developed a theory of the BWB and, following wind tunnel tests the Westland Dreadnought was built. It stalled on its first flight in 1924, severely injuring the pilot, and the project was cancelled. The idea was proposed again in the early 1940s for a Miles M.26 airliner project and the Miles M.30 \"X Minor\" research prototype was built to investigate it. The McDonnell XP-67 prototype interceptor also flew in 1944 but did not meet expectations.\n\nNASA returned to the concept in the 1990s with an artificially stabilized model (6% scale) called BWB-17, built by Stanford University, which was flown in 1997 and showed good handling qualities. From 2000 NASA went on to develop a remotely controlled research model with a wingspan.\n\nNASA has also jointly explored BWB designs for the Boeing X-48 unmanned aerial vehicle. Studies suggested that a BWB airliner carrying from 450 to 800 passengers could achieve fuel savings of over 20 percent.\n\nAirbus is studying a BWB design as a possible replacement for the A320neo family. A sub-scale model flew for the first time in June 2019 as part of the MAVERIC (Model Aircraft for Validation and Experimentation of Robust Innovative Controls) programme, which Airbus hopes will help it reduce CO emissions by up to 50% relative to 2005 levels.\n\nThe BWB form minimises the total wetted area - the surface area of the aircraft skin, thus reducing skin drag to a minimum. It also creates a thickening of the wing root area, allowing a more efficient structure and reduced weight compared to a conventional craft. NASA also plans to integrate Ultra High Bypass (UHB) ratio jet engines with the hybrid wing body.\n\nThe wide interior spaces created by the blending pose novel structural challenges. NASA has been studying foam-clad stitched-fabric carbon fiber composite skinning to create uninterrupted cabin space.\n\nA conventional tubular fuselage carries 12-13% of the total lift compared to 31-43% carried by the centerbody in a BWB, where an intermediate lifting-fuselage configuration better suited to narrowbody sized airliners would carry 25-32% for a 6.1% - 8.2% increase in fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nAt an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics meeting on March 28, 2018 at the University of Washington in Seattle, Boeing's VP of Product Development and Future Airplane Development Mike Sinnett noted that as the center wingbox is also the passenger cabin, it needs to be tall enough to stand upright, translating into a large transport minimum span for multiple hundreds of passengers. For the same payload, a cargo BWB has more wingspan but is heavier empty and it is not worth it for short missions of around four or fewer hours, while long haul routes would see a benefit. However, the larger wing span may conflict with airport compatibility and containers quick loading: changing the infrastructure would need an economical improvement of more than 20% over current designs, except maybe for a military cargo aircraft. A tube-and-wing design is easier to stretch or shrink for several sub-types sharing the large development costs while a BWB can hardly be modified by its most expensive non-constant section in a non-constant way.\n\nA concept photo of a blended wing body commercial aircraft appeared in the November 2003 issue of \"Popular Science\" magazine. Artists Neill Blomkamp and Simon van de Lagemaat from The Embassy Visual Effects created the photo for the magazine using computer graphics software to depict the future of aviation and air travel. In 2006 the image was used in an email hoax claiming that Boeing had developed a 1000-passenger jetliner (the \"Boeing 797\") with a \"radical Blended Wing design\" and Boeing refuted the claim.\n\n\n"}

He is primarily known for his work on Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Thysanoptera, but worked on all insect orders and on many aspects of entomology.\n\nHaliday was born in Holywood, County Down, Ireland. A boyhood friend of Robert Templeton, he divided his time between Ireland and Lucca, where he co-founded the Italian Entomological Society with Camillo Rondani and Adolfo Targioni Tozzetti. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Belfast Natural History Society, the Microscopical Society of London, and the Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science, as well as a fellow of the (now Royal) Entomological Society of London.\n\nAlexander Haliday was among the greatest dipterists of the 19th century and one of the most renowned British entomologists. His achievements were in four main fields: description, higher taxonomy, synonymy, and biology. He erected many major taxa including the order Thysanoptera and the families Mymaridae and Ichneumonidae.\n\nAlexander Henry Haliday was born in Clifden, Holywood, a small seaside town in County Down, Ireland on November 21, 1806. He was the eldest child of Dr William Haliday (1763-1836) and Marion Webster. Haliday had a brother named William Robert and a sister named Hortense. His father was the nephew and heir of Dr Alexander Henry Haliday, one of Belfast's best known physicians and political activists. The Haliday family was Protestant, though not religious, and clearly well-placed, holding of farmland in County Antrim valued at £3,054.00 in 1820 (£246,763.20 in 2017). The family also owned properties in Holywood and Dublin and had a cloth merchant business and shipping interests. The Haliday family was related to the wealthy Luccan Pisani family, whom Haliday visited often throughout his life.\n\nHaliday began his education at the Belfast Academical Institution, a school that had strong leanings towards natural history. Haliday studied Classics when he was twelve, Arithmetic when he was fourteen, and Mathematics when he was sixteen. He learned several other subjects, including natural history from George Crawford Hyndman. Haliday left the Belfast Academical Institution and the family home in nearby Holywood at fifteen, moving to Dublin where he entered Trinity College in 1822. He graduated in 1827, and was awarded a gold medal in classics. Haliday then went to Paris, where he stayed for almost a year.\n\nFrom 1825 to 1840, Haliday spent most of his time in Dublin. He returned frequently to Clifden however, and spent much of his time in London and sometimes visited Lucca, where he stayed with the Pisani family. Haliday also spent much of his time collecting insects across England, most often with Francis Walker and John Curtis at the Darent river and Southgate. In 1835, he joined William Thompson on a tour of England and Wales which began in London at the British Museum and the Zoological Gardens and included visits to Matlock, the Lake District (Vale of Newlands), Crummock Water, Llangollen, and Snowdon. From 1841 and 1848, Haliday spent most, if not all, of his time away from Ireland, mainly at the Pisani family home in Lucca. In 1842, he was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim and lived in the townland of Ballyhowne in the parish of Carnmoney.\n\nFrom 1854 to 1860, after having moved back to Dublin, Haliday was employed as an Invertebrate Zoology lecturer at the University of Dublin. During these years, he also edited parts of the Natural History Review, became a founding member of the Dublin University Geological Society, gave lectures at meetings of the Dublin University Zoological Association (Trinity College), and curated the insect collections at the same University. He also made regular visits to London, usually staying with Henry Tibbats Stainton. These visits often coincided with meetings of the Entomological Society of London.\n\nIn February 1862, Haliday moved to Lucca. Following a trip to Sicily, he moved into Villa Pisani with his cousin, Mme. Pisani, and her family. Expeditions and meetings with entomologists became much more frequent. From 1862 until his death, Haliday traveled across Italy collecting insects, mainly in the North (Emilia-Romagna, Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Aosta Valley, and Tuscany), although he made two trips to Sicily. Various trips to Switzerland, France, and Bavaria followed, and in 1865, with Edward Perceval Wright, he made an entomological expedition to Portugal. In 1868 and 1870, he toured Sicily with Wright. Haliday died in Bagni di Lucca in 1870 and is buried there in the English Cemetery.\n\nHaliday was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Microscopical Society of London, the Entomological Society of London, the Linnean Society of London, the Dublin University Zoological Association, the Dublin University Geological Society, the Italian Entomological Society, the Entomological Society of Stettin, and the Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science.\n\nHaliday worked mainly with very small insects. Study of the tiny parts required dissection, glass slide mounting, and a very high quality microscope. He acquired his equipment from the London microscopist Andrew Pritchard. Whole specimens were mounted on card using gum, the card being transfixed by an entomological pin of German manufacture.\n\nSince the descriptions were necessarily based on more than one specimen are sometimes ambiguous (based on more than one species). Collecting and general methodology followed the instructions given by George Samouelle in \"The entomologist's useful compendium; or, An introduction to the knowledge of British insects, comprising the best means of obtaining and preserving them, and a description of the apparatus generally used\" and Abel Ingpen's manual \"Instructions for collecting, rearing, and preserving British & foreign insects: also for collecting and preserving crustacea and shells\". On collecting trips he used a Coddington lens.\n\nHaliday's collection comprising 78 boxes was presented by Trinity of Ireland College to the Museum of Science and Art (now the National Museum of Ireland) in 1882, twelve years after Haliday's death. The dating of the parts of the collection is confusing but the bulk of it was put together before 1860. Although the collection was damaged, and substantial portions of it have been lost, it remains a very large insect collection. The bulk of the material collected by Haliday himself is in the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera. The undamaged Hymenoptera material is laid out in numbered blocks of systematised taxa, usually disparate groups (representing species) disposed below the appropriate generic name. Most of Haliday's specimens are from Ireland, however several of them are from England, Scotland, and Italy. In addition to the specialist collections of Hymenoptera and Diptera, there is Haliday's own general collection (mainly Coleoptera), and a large body of material added to the collection by other entomologists. The largest single source of donations to the collection was Francis Walker, the London entomologist with whom Haliday had a career-long association. The Walker addition was made up mostly of Hymenoptera and Diptera insects, however it contained insects of most other orders, especially Coleoptera and Thysanoptera. Other collectors represented are John Curtis, James Charles Dale, Jean Antoine Dours, Arnold Förster or Foerster, Hermann Loew, Fernandino Maria Piccioli, G.T.Rudd, William Wilson Saunders, JamesFrancis Stephens, and Thomas Vernon Wollaston. The collection also includes a considerable amount of material taken by Charles Darwin on the Beagle Voyage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on Hagen Hagen, H.A., 1862-1863 and\n\nMissing Literature\n\"Hymenopterorum Synopsis and Methodum Fallenii ut plurimum accommodata\" (Belfast) 4pg. s.titulo.was privately printed in Belfast and dated only by contemporary reference (1839).

It was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment of the\nBritish Indian Army in 1947 and has taken part in various battles and wars since, winning numerous honours for the same.\n\nPrior to independence and partition there were a number of \"Punjab Regiments\" in the British Indian Army. These were amalgamated to form six regiments: the 1st Punjab Regiment, the 2nd Punjab Regiment, the 8th Punjab Regiment, the 14th Punjab Regiment, the 15th Punjab Regiment and the 16th Punjab Regiment. At the onset of independence in 1947, the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments went over to the newly raised Pakistan Army, while the 2nd Punjab Regiment was retained in the Indian Army. Troops were transferred between regiments based on whether the soldiers would be a part of Pakistan or India.\n\nThe Punjab Regiment is one of the oldest in the Indian Army. The first battalion which today constitutes this regiment was raised in 1805, by the then Maharaja of Patiala. The first four British-raised battalions of what later became the 2nd Punjab Regiment and finally the Punjab Regiment, were raised during the hostilities in the Carnatic in South India between 1761 and 1776. The first and second battalions have been moved to other regiments and the fourth battalion was disbanded. The third battalion still continues as part of the regiment. The numbers and titles of the battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army, the British Indian Army and the Indian Army during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The names changed from Coast Sepoys to Carnatic Infantry, Madras Native Infantry, Punjabis and finally to the Punjab Regiment. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British applied the martial races theory and north Indian troops replaced the south Indians, the regiment eventually being renamed as the Punjab Regiment.\n\nThe 1st battalion of the 2nd Punjab Regiment initially formed part of the 44th Airborne Division in an airborne role on the disbandment of the Parachute Regiment in 1946 and was called 1st battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment (Para). The unit retained most of the Punjab Regiment's uniform, but donned the maroon beret, qualification wings and allied insignias of airborne forces. In 1952, when the Parachute Regiment was re-raised and a Regimental Centre formed, the 1st battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment (Para) became the first battalion of the Parachute Regiment and was renamed as the 1st battalion, Parachute Regiment (Punjab). The uniform changed to the Parachute Regiment's, but the battalion retained the Punjab Regiment's hackle on its headgear.\n\nIn 1951, four experienced battalions of the former princely states of Punjab joined the Regiment. These were a battalion each from the Jind and Nabha State Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were designated as the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the Punjab Regiment. Additional battalions have been raised since 1963.\n\n15 Punjab (formerly First Patiala) completed 300 years of service on 13 April 2005. The battalion was raised on the auspicious Baisakhi day in 1705 by Baba Alla Singh, the founder of Patiala State. It was the first battalion of the state forces of the Maharaja of Patiala. Apart from being the oldest infantry battalion in the Indian Army, 15 Punjab also has the proud distinction of being the second highest decorated battalion of the Army, with 22 Battle Honours, one Theatre Honour (Punjab) and numerous gallantry awards. The battalion took part in numerous campaigns in India and abroad, carving a mark for itself in every operation. In May 1900, the battalion was re-designated as First Patiala Imperial Service Infantry (Rajindra Sikh). During World War I, it took part in operations in the Middle East under the British Expeditionary Force. In 1932, the battalion was re-designated as First Patiala Rajindra Sikh Infantry. During World War II, the battalion participated in the Burma Campaign. It successfully cut off the Japanese lines of communication, thus halting their advance towards India. Thereafter, the battalion sailed to Port Dickson for action in Malaya and Batavia (now Java).\n\n2 Punjab (now 1st battalion, Brigade of the Guards) was raised in 1762 as the tenth battalion of the Coastal Sepoys and has been redesignated eighteen times since then. The troop composition of the unit was changed to a North Zone Battalion in 1902 and the unit was redesignated as 69 Punjab. In 1922, the unit was redesignated as 2nd battalion, 2 Punjab Regiment. The battalion, by virtue of its seniority and efficiency, was handpicked by the then Chief of the Army Staff, Gen. (later Field Marshal) K. M. Cariappa to be redesignated as 1st battalion, Brigade of the Guards, in April 1951. Lt. Col. (later Brigadier) Shivinder Singh was the first commanding officer of the battalion. Since then, 22 commanding officers have commanded the battalion. Of them, Lt. Col. M.C.S Menon, Lt. Col. Sehdev Sahgal and Lt. Col. P.P Singh retired as Generals.\n\nIn recent years, the Punjab Regiment has contributed towards UN peacekeeping missions by sending six of its battalions overseas: 3 Punjab to Gaza, 14 Punjab to Angola, 15 and 26 Punjab to Lebanon and 16 and 24 Punjab to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe Regimental Centre was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut in 1929 and its present location in Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand, in 1976.\n\nOthers:\n\nThe regiment has an affiliation with , a heavy destroyer of the Indian Navy.\n\nThe original battalions of the regiment that were transferred to India after 1947 were composed primarily of Jatt Sikh and Dogra soldiers who belonged to the districts of Punjab that were given to Pakistan. However the second and third generations for the regiment were recruited both among this refugee community but recruitment was opened up to all castes and communities of Punjab, Jammu and Himachal Pradesh in the late 1960s. The regiment currently consists of Dogras and Sikhs primarily drawn from north Indian regions of Jammu, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. However, as an exception, two regular battalions (19 and 27 Punjab) have troops from other Indian castes as well.\n\nDuring the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, A Company (reinforced) of the 23rd battalion, Punjab Regiment, consisting of about 120 soldiers under the command of Major (later Brigadier) Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, fought off an assault by a brigade of the Pakistan Army. The battle was fought at the desert border post of Longewala, Rajasthan. The unit fought during the last five hours of the night of 5 December 1971 unsupported as the Indian Air Force aircraft at the time did not have night attack capabilities. For his leadership during the battle, Maj. Chandpuri was decorated with the Maha Vir Chakra, the second highest gallantry award in India.\n\nThe regiment is perhaps the only infantry regiment with naval galley as an insignia, anywhere. It was awarded to 69th Punjabis (later 2nd Punjab) in recognition of the readiness to serve overseas, after the battalion had fought in eight overseas campaigns by 1824.\n\nSholinghur, Carnatic, Mysore, Mehidpore, Ava, China, Pegu, Lucknow, Burma, Afghanistan, Laos, Flanders, Hellis, Krithia, Gallipoli, Suez, Egypt, Sharon, Nablus, Palestine, Aden, Kut-al-Amara, Baghdad, Mesopotamia, North Western Frontier, Mersa Metruh, Buthidaung, Ngakyedauk Pass, Imphal, Kangla Tongbi, Tonzang, Kennedy Peak, Meiktila, pyinmana, Malaya, Ipoh, Singapore, Kern and Casa Bettini.\n\nZoji La, Ichhogil, Dograi, Barki, Kalidhar, Bedori, Nangi Tekri, Brachil Pass, Laungewala, Garibpur, Chak Amaru and Jessore\n\n"}
{"id": "2179446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179446", "title": "Ewloe Castle", "text": "Ewloe Castle\n\nEwloe Castle () is a native Welsh castle built by the Kingdom of Gwynedd near the town of Ewloe in Flintshire, Wales. The castle, which was one of the last fortifications to be built by the native Princes of Wales, was abandoned at the beginning of the invasion of Wales by Edward I in 1277. Its construction, using locally quarried sandstone, appears to have continued piecemeal over many years and may have not been completed. On taking the castle, the English Crown gave it little military value and allowed it to fall into ruin.\n\nEwloe was sited on high ground within Tegeingl, a cantref in the lands of North East Wales (Welsh \"Perfeddwlad\"). Standing near the Chester road, it maintained a strategic position near the Wales–England border. The castle is located on a steeply-sloped promontory within a forested valley. It overlooks the junction of two streams with higher ground to the south. \n\nEwloe Castle combines features from both motte-and-bailey and enclosure castles. An asymmetrical curtain wall – with parapets – encloses two courtyards. A rock-cut neck ditch defends the southern side of the castle. In the upper triangular inner ward is a D-shaped tower known as the \"Welsh keep\". This stands on a stone outcrop that forms the motte; it has a stone revetment around its base (a basic Chemise). The lower outer ward is enclosed by two separate sections of wall that meet at a circular fortified tower, which stands upon a rocky knoll. As the curtain walls are not joined together, ladders would have had to be used to reach their parapets.\n\nNo gateways connected the inner ward to the outer courtyard. Access into Ewloe Castle was entirely via wooden ramps. The outer ward had several wooden buildings. An external defensive rampart occupies the higher ground to the south of the castle above the neck ditch.\n\nWithin the inner ward is a D-shaped (or horseshoe-shaped) tower known as the \"Welsh Keep\". Although a flight of stairs lead up to a first floor gateway – a similarity shared with contemporary military architecture, the shape of the tower does not conform with keeps of the later Plantagenet period. D-shaped towers usually projected out from a wall or gatehouse but at Ewloe the castle builders placed the tower/keep on a motte in the upper ward surrounded by its own curtain wall. This feature has precedence in Welsh military architecture. Llywelyn the Great built a similar D-shaped tower at Castell y Bere at Llanfihangel-y-pennant in Gwynedd in the 1220s.\n\nThe tower's outer walls – which are at their base – rose to about . They were higher than the upper storey to protect its pitched roof from projectiles. A parapet ran around the top of the tower. Spaces in the stonework show where storage slots were placed in the upper roof spaces. The tower had a single first floor hall that stood above a lower ground floor chamber. Defensive arrowslits were placed on the curved sides of the tower. The flat side, which overlooks the outer ward, has a Romanesque window.\n\nEwloe Castle, which was built around 1257, is a relic of a brief triumph that the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had over the English Crown and the Anglo-Norman Marcher Lords in the mid 13th century. Until then, this part of north east Wales had been the starting point for repeated Norman invasions of Gwynedd for more than 150 years.\n\nBut beginning in the early 1230s, the Princes of Gwynedd had started to gain the upper hand against the Anglo-Normans and Plantagenets who had taken territory in North Wales. Eventually by the late 1250s, the Welsh had reached Ewloe retaking lands up to the England–Wales border. A fortification had existed on or near the site since the Battle of Ewloe () in 1157, when the Welsh successfully ambushed an English force under the command of Henry II (as they marched to Twthill at Rhuddlan). The English king only narrowly avoiding being killed himself having been rescued by Roger, Earl of Hertford.\n\nIn 1257 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had work begin on the castle. The fortification incorporated previous work undertaken by both Owain Gwynedd and Llywelyn the Great. It was built from locally quarried sandstone. There are no records to say when construction ended, however, its design – such as the D-shaped Welsh Keep – suggest it was conceived and built entirely by a Welsh workforce. Debate varies on whether Ewloe was intended to be an actual defensive fortification or a hunting lodge for Welsh nobility.\n\nIn July 1277, Edward I began the first Welsh War by marching his forces out of the castle at Chester and up the west coast of the Dee Estuary. After an advanced base was established at Flint (a day's travel from Chester), building work immediately began on Flint Castle. Ewloe Castle is not mentioned in chronicles of the 1277 invasion suggesting the Welsh had abandoned the area; retreating to stronger defensive positions along the Clwydian Hills further to the west.\n\nAs Edward I's castles at Flint and Rhuddlan could be provisioned by sea, Ewloe was never used by the English military.\n\nThe only contemporary reference to the Ewloe Castle is in the Chester \"Plea Rolls\" that mentions a report sent to Edward II in 1311. The Justice of Chester wrote to the King regarding the history of the manor at Ewloe from the middle of the 12th century. The rolls record that by 1257 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had regained Ewloe from the English and built a castle in the wood; noting in 1311 that much of the castle was still standing.\n\nBy the late medieval period, the site was in ruins. Much of the castle's dressed stone work from its curtain walls and Keep were removed for construction material around Mold and Connah's Quay.\n\nEwloe Castle, which is a Grade I listed building, is incorporated within Wepre Park; a country park managed by Flintshire County Council. The castle is under the care of Cadw – the national heritage agency for Wales. It can be reached by footpaths through Wepre Woods. Public access is free.\n\nIn November 2009, the castle was among five lots of farmland and woodland put up for sale by Flintshire County Council. The local authority stressed Ewloe and the site it occupies were protected from any development. It was sold at auction to an anonymous farmer along with of surrounding land for £122,000.\n\n"}

An Alpine cheese, it is produced in Beaufortain, Tarentaise valley and Maurienne, which are located in the Savoie region of the French Alps.\n\nThere are three varieties of Beaufort:\n\n\nBeaufort was first certified as an appellation d'origine contrôlée in 1968.\n\nBeaufort is produced in the Beaufortain, Tarentaise and Maurienne valleys, as well as parts of the Val d'Arly valley, all located on 450,000 hectares of the Savoie region.\n\nThe cheese is prepared using of milk for every of cheese desired. The milk used in one variety comes from the Tarine or Abondance cows that graze in the Alps.\n\nTo make Beaufort, the milk is first heated and then cast into a beechwood hoop or mold which gives the cheese its distinctive concave shape. It is pressed for 24 hours, taken out of the hoops and then cooled for another 24 hours. Once cooled, it is soaked in brine and then stored on spruce shelves for one to two months. During this part of the process, one side of the cheese is hand-salted each morning, then turned over and massaged each afternoon. Once the cheese rind has reached a level of maturity, the cheese is smear-ripened with a mixture called morge which produces its strong flavour and pale yellow rind. The prepared cheese must then age for 6–12 months, or even longer, in a cool mountain cellar.\n\nBeaufort cheese is pale yellow, with a smooth and creamy texture and lacks holes like other Gruyère-style cheeses, Comté, Vacherin Fribourgeois or Emmental. Beaufort also has a very distinct aroma, sometime described as strong or mildly pungent and reminiscent of the pastures on which the Tarentaise and Abondance cows graze to provide the milk used for the cheese.\n\nBeaufort is commonly used to make cheese fondue because it melts easily. One of the many cheeses that go well with white wine, Beaufort is often enjoyed with fish, especially salmon.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179482", "title": "Dodo bird verdict", "text": "Dodo bird verdict\n\nThe Dodo bird verdict (or Dodo bird conjecture) is a controversial topic in psychotherapy, referring to the claim that all empirically validated psychotherapies, regardless of their specific components, produce equivalent outcomes. It is named after The Dodo character of Alice in Wonderland. The conjecture was introduced by Saul Rosenzweig in 1936, drawing on imagery from Lewis Carroll's novel \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", but only came into prominence with the emergence of new research evidence in the 1970s.\n\nThe importance of the continuing debate surrounding the Dodo bird verdict stems from its implications for professionals involved in the field of psychotherapy and the psychotherapies made available to clients.\n\nThe \"Dodo bird verdict\" terminology was coined by Saul Rosenzweig in 1936 to illustrate the notion that all therapies are equally effective. Rosenzweig borrowed the phrase from Lewis Carroll's 1865 book, \"Alice in Wonderland\", wherein a number of characters become wet and, in order to dry themselves, the Dodo Bird decided to issue a competition: everyone was to run around the lake until they were dry. Nobody cared to measure how far each person had run, nor how long. When they asked the Dodo who had won, he thought long and hard and then said, \"Everybody has won and all must have prizes.\" In the case of psychotherapies, Rosenzweig argued that common factors were more important than specific technical differences, so that (on the Dodo bird conjecture) all therapies are winners; they all produce equally effective outcomes.\n\nThe Dodo bird debate only took flight in 1975 when Lester Luborsky, Barton Singer and Lise Luborsky reported the results of one of the first comparative studies demonstrating few significant differences in the outcomes among different psychotherapies. This study spurred a plethora of new studies in both opposition to and support of the Dodo bird verdict.\n\nThe Dodo bird debate, in brief, is focused on whether or not the specific components of different treatments lead some treatments to outperform other treatments for specific disorders. Supporters of the Dodo bird verdict contend that all psychotherapies are equivalent because of \"common factors\" that are shared in all treatments (i.e., having a relationship with a therapist who is warm, respectful, and has high expectations for client success). In contrast, critics of the Dodo bird verdict would argue that the specific techniques used in different therapies are important, and all therapies do not produce equivalent outcomes for specific disorders.\n\nCommon factors theory states that if certain therapies in psychology are equally effective, it is because of the common factors they share. The most important causal agents in treatment are the common factors; the specific techniques that are unique to treatment strategies have only minor importance.\n\nThere is research to support common factors theory. One common factor is the client–therapist interaction, also known as the therapeutic alliance. A 1992 paper by Lambert showed that nearly 40 percent of the improvement in psychotherapy is from these client–therapist variables. Other researchers have further analyzed the importance of client–therapist variables in treatment. They found that improvement in the patient was due to extra-therapeutic factors, for example patients' thought processes. Data shows that patients with more positive attitudes will have a better chance of experiencing clinical improvement, regardless of the therapist's actions. Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of many studies of psychotherapy, Wampold \"et al.\" 2002, found that 7% of the variability in treatment outcome was due to the therapeutic alliance whereas 1% of the variability was due to a specific treatment. The therapist's attitude is also a very important causal agent in positive patient change. Najavits and Strupp (1994) demonstrated that a positive, warm, caring, and genuine therapist generated statistically significant differences in patient outcome. Wampold \"et al.\" 2002, also found that nearly 70% of the variability in treatment outcome was due to the therapist's attitude toward the efficacy of the treatment. Specific components of therapy are concluded to be relatively frivolous when compared with the more profound and directly patient affecting common factors.\n\nResearchers have studied common factors in detail. Grencavage and Norcross (1990) identified 35 common factors in published sources. The identified common factors were categorized into five main groups: client characteristics, therapist qualities, change processes, treatment structures and relationship elements. Examples of some of the common factors included within these broad categories are persuasion, a healing setting, engagement, the use of rituals and techniques, suggestion, and emotional learning. Tracey \"et al.\" 2003, examined deeper relationships among the categories and common factors. They concluded that there are two dimensions of therapy: feeling and thinking. Within each of the two dimensions are three clusters: bond, information, and role.\n\nData provide evidence for the Dodo bird verdict. Generally speaking, common factors are responsible for patient improvement instead of any component of a specific treatment. Researchers such as Wampold and Luborsky continue to support this claim in recent articles published in \"the Behavioral Therapist\". Wampold \"et al.\" 2010 refutes claims made by Siev \"et al.\" 2009 that Wampold 2009 made errors in research. Wampold \"et al.\" 2009, suggests that people need to \"accept the importance of the alliance and therapists and remain committed to developing and improving treatments.\" Wampold continues by saying that techniques could be beneficial in psychotherapy because they are the easiest variables to manipulate. These variables can act to change alliance and other common factors. Common factors can then be closely monitored and carefully distributed to patients via the therapist.\n\nSome researchers have pointed out that there are many reasons to study common factors among different psychotherapies, and some of those reasons may have nothing to do with the Dodo bird verdict. Regardless of whether or not certain psychotherapies are roughly equally effective, studying the commonalities among treatments can lead to a better understanding of why the treatments are effective.\n\nIn opposition to the Dodo bird verdict, there are a growing number of studies demonstrating that some treatments produce better outcomes for particular disorders when compared to other treatments. Here, in contrast to the common factor theory, specific components of the therapy have shown predictive power. The most compelling evidence against the Dodo bird verdict is illustrated by the research done on anxiety disorders. Many studies have found specific treatment modalities to be beneficial when treating anxiety disorders, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Albeit, other studies do not show evidence for cognitive-behavioural and focus on different topics. CBT uses techniques from both cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy to modify maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. One challenge to the opposition, however, is that some studies were conducted with waiting lists or against medication and criticism can arise as the therapeutic relationship is known to be a factor which influences outcomes. This means the control group may not experience the human condition, whereby the experimental group have an advantage when analysing differences. In addition, comparator trials with other modalities have been known to have unfair training standards between therapies, with some counsellors being given brief workshops over several days to evaluate the efficacy of an approach during trials. Humanistic therapies are also notably difficult to examine due to having less measurable factors that do not fare well under randomised controlled trials. Many of the more extensive studies using different research methodologies with larger sample sizes are overlooked for the perceived gold standard in research. Cognitive-behavioural therapy has indeed been the most examined counselling method; however, to visualise this, you may wish to see them as the big fish in a small pond. Numerous meta-analyses have shown that CBT yields significantly superior results in the treatment of psychological disorders, most notably, anxiety disorders. However, CBT also plays a positive role in treating depression, eating disorders, substance abuse disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In meta-analytic reviews, there is generally a larger effect size when CBT is used to treat anxiety disorders. Recent studies show that when treating generalized anxiety disorder, CBT generated an effect size of 0.51, which indicates a medium effect. That is a much larger effect compared to supportive therapy and other treatments. Similarly, when treating social anxiety disorder, CBT produced an effect size of 0.62, which again supports the evidence that CBT does in fact yield significantly better results than other therapies. Those supporting the Dodo bird verdict often use meta-analyses to compare multiple treatments in order to illustrate that these treatments have no really significant differences. Some critics claim that if comparisons are made between treatments that already have empirical support (empirically supported treatments, or ESTs) then this will tend to reduce estimates of variability. Nonetheless, Wampold's criteria for including treatments in meta analyses of treatment variability do not require prior empirical support; rather, they must be \"intended to be therapeutic\". \n\nResearch supporting differences among different treatments for specific disorders is now reflected in the latest EST guidelines. ESTs are developed from multiple control trial tests to evaluate which therapies yield the best results for specific disorders. These disorders include, but are not limited to, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and OCD. According to the Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association (APA), psychologists and therapists have an obligation to avoid harming their clients in any way. ESTs are a major component in this movement. By using specific therapies clinically proven to improve certain disorders, therapists are avoiding further damage to their patients. However, supporting the idea of ESTs inevitably implies that some therapies are in fact more efficacious than others for particular disorders.\n\nThere is also research suggesting that some treatments might be harmful. Indeed, \"if psychotherapy is powerful enough to do good, it may be powerful enough to do harm\". Some psychotherapies can be labeled as unhelpful, meaning they give no assistance, while others fall under the category of harmful, meaning they are actually damaging or dangerous to the patient. When identifying a \"harmful\" treatment it is important to note the distinction between \"harm that can be caused by a disorder and harm that can be caused by the application of a treatment\". The negative outcomes of some psychotherapies are becoming an alarming reality in the field of clinical psychology. Studies have shown that individuals exhibited negative responses to treatment in some substance abuse work, some types of grief therapy, and certain therapeutic techniques with trauma and PTSD patients. While those studies that support the Dodo bird verdict focus on the importance of building a client–therapist relationship, some studies have \"identified a number of other relationship factors that may interfere with or negatively impact therapeutic change\". The emerging evidence to the effect that there are possibly harmful psychotherapies is not only contradictory to the \"all therapies are equal\" stance of the Dodo bird verdict, but may also point out problems implicating the APA's Code of Ethics. Many meta-analyses show that there are treatments that do yield more positive outcomes for specific disorders. However, proof that some treatments actually harm patients instead of helping them further erodes support for the Dodo bird verdict.\n\nA considerable amount of the controversy about the Dodo bird verdict relates to the meta-analytic methods used in research. These generate a lack of clear psychotherapeutic evidence for the support of either side in the debate. Meta-analytic studies have compared the effect sizes of different treatments, but have not been reliable in finding a consistent effect size. This could be because of several confounding variables. For example, many researchers are said to \"have an agenda\" when conducting meta-analyses, cherry-picking experiments they want to use in their study in order to produce the results they want. This pre-determined skewing results in unfair representations of the research. \"Agenda\"-based meta-analyses are confounded with the researcher's political, social, and economical opinions. Since psychologists are given the power to choose which studies are used in a meta-analysis, personal biases are involved, and the meta-analysis will produce biased results if the researcher is not careful in controlling for his or her own opinions.\n\nResearchers opposing the Dodo bird verdict have found Dodo bird supporters' meta-analyses to be \"agenda\"-based and highly subjective. Arguments have proposed that meta-analyses could possibly produce misleading results because of the type of studies combined in the comparison. In Paul Crits-Christoph's review of Wampold et al.'s (1997) comparative study, a work that supported the Dodo bird verdict, he concluded that out of the 114 articles used in the study, 79 of them involve similar comparative tests. Some meta-analyses constructed are not sensitive to the subtle distinctions between treatment effects, especially among comparative studies of highly similar treatments.\n\nDodo bird supporting researchers have found anti-Dodo bird supporters' research to also be \"agenda\"-based. For example, Wampold (2009) found Siev et al.'s (2007) study whose research for significance of CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) versus RT (Rational Therapy) was resting on one experiment with an uncharacteristically large effect size (1.02) by Clark et al. (1994). Wampold found this effect size to be invalid because of the internal biases of the study. When this flawed experiment was removed from the analysis, the effect size was not statistically significant for the use of CBT over RT in panic disorder therapy. Against this research, in support of the anti-Dodo bird verdict, Chambless (2002) stated that \"errors in data analysis, exclusion of research on many types of clients, faulty generalization to comparisons between therapies that have never been made, and erroneous sorts of treatments for all sorts of problems can be assumed to represent the difference between any two types of treatment for a given problem.\"\n\nClearly, if meta-analyses are to be taken seriously, they need to be conducted carefully and objectively. In support of the anti-Dodo bird side, Hunsley (2007) says that when \"measurement quality is controlled for and when treatments are appropriately categorized, there is consistent evidence in both treatment outcome and comparative treatment research that cognitive and behavioral treatments are superior to other treatments for a wide range of conditions, in both adult and child samples.\" This suggests that if and when variables are controlled, there is appreciable evidence for the superiority of cognitive and behavioral treatments.\n\nThe outcome of the Dodo bird debate has extremely important implications for the future of clinical psychology. For one, policymakers have to know how effective each existing psychotherapy is in order to be able to decide which therapies should be supported. This controversy may also lead governmental officials to cut funding for psychological treatments and other public health measures.\n\nPerhaps the greatest illustration of the current state of the Dodo bird verdict is seen in the meta-analyses of Wampold and Barlow and the responses to it. In these meta-analyses, researchers on both sides point out the weaknesses and inconsistencies in their opponents' positions. Although both sides are trying to improve psychology in their respective ways, the disagreement about and lack of consistent evidence for the Dodo bird verdict may in fact be the cause of increased public doubt about the field. The conclusion of the debate could nationally dictate which therapists and which procedures will remain financially supported. For example, if the Dodo bird verdict is thought to be true regarding different psychotherapies, then many clinicians would feel free to use any therapy they see fit to employ. However, if the Dodo bird verdict is proven to be false, then clinicians would likely have to use empirically supported therapies when treating their clients.\n\nFuelling the debate have been alternative visions or paradigms of mental illness. Those believing in a medical model of mental illness and cure see the Dodo bird verdict as necessarily untrue – even absurd – whatever the evidence supporting it. Those who see therapy as context-based – as relying on a shared frame of reference or context between client and therapist for optimum results – will almost equally automatically welcome the Dodo bird verdict.\n"}

{"id": "2179487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179487", "title": "Plum pox", "text": "Plum pox\n\nPlum pox, also known as sharka, is the most devastating viral disease of stone fruit from the genus \"Prunus\". The disease is caused by the plum pox virus (PPV), and the different strains may infect a variety of stone fruit species including peaches, apricots, plums, nectarine, almonds, and sweet and tart cherries. Wild and ornamental species of \"Prunus\" may also become infected by some strains of the virus.\n\nThe virus is transmitted by aphids and by the transfer of infected plant material to new locations. Plum pox poses no danger to consumers, but it can ruin the marketability of stone fruit by causing acidity and deformities. The only way to manage the disease is to destroy all infected trees, which can cause significant economic losses.\n\nThe disease symptoms were first seen in Bulgaria around 1916-1917, thus the name of \"sharka\" - from Bulgarian \"шарка\", meaning \"pox\". In 1933, the virus origin was described by Dimitar Atanasov. The disease developed and spread in several European countries, and may have largely wiped out the ancient landrace variously called Pozegaca, Quetsche or German prune.\n\nThe plum pox virus is a linear single stranded RNA virus. There are nine strains of plum pox virus: PPV-D, PPV-M, PPV-EA, PPV-C, PPV-Rec (Recombinant), PPV-W, PPV-T, PPV-CR, and PPV-An. PPV-M isolates are more aggressive in peach, are aphid vectored more efficiently, and spread more rapidly in an orchard. PPV-M has been reported to be seed transmitted, the other PPV strains are known not be transmitted through seeds. Both PPV strains M and D infest peach, plum, and apricot. PPV-C infects sweet and tart cherry naturally and is the only strain known to do so, it has infected other \"Prunus\" hosts experimentally.\n\nSeveral species of aphid transmit the virus including the plum-thistle aphid (\"Brachycaudus cardui\"), the plum leaf curl aphid (\"Brachycaudus helichrysi\") and the green peach aphid (\"Myzus persicae\"). Winged aphids can transmit plum pox within an orchard, and over short distances (200–300 meters) to trees in nearby orchards. Unlike some other viruses, like barley yellow dwarf virus, PPV is not persistent in the aphid and is transferred from the mouthparts of the aphid between plants. Long distance spread usually occurs as a result of the movement of infected nursery stock or propagative materials. Once a plant is infected the virus is systemic and occurs in the cytoplasm of cells from all parts of the plant.\n\nWhen a host tree is infected by plum pox, the infection eventually results in severely reduced fruit production, and the fruit that is produced is often misshapen and blemished. The presence of plum pox can also enhance the effects of other endemic viruses infecting various species of the genus \"Prunus\", such as prune dwarf virus, Prunus necrotic (browning) ringspot virus, and apple chlorotic (yellowing) leaf spot virus, resulting in still greater economic losses.\n\nIn peach, infected trees may exhibit color-breaking symptoms in the blossoms. This appears as darker pink stripes on the flower petals and can be useful for early season surveys. Symptoms can be present in young leaves in the spring and /or on developing fruit. Some trees show no symptoms on leaves or fruit.\n\nNot all infection in \"Prunus\" are characterized by a ring symptom on leaves. Several cultivars show yellowing line patterns and blotches, or necrotic ring symptoms on expanded leaves. Leaf distortion has also been observed. Infected fruit can develop yellow rings or blotches, or brown rings, and some plum and apricot fruit can be severely deformed and bumpy. The seed of many infected apricots and some plums show rings.\n\nMany non-\"Prunus\" species, in at least nine plant families, have been infected artificially with one or more strains of the plum pox virus, and in some cases found naturally infected in the field. The maintenance of the virus in non-\"Prunus\" species complicates disease management.\n\nNo cure or treatment is known for the disease once a tree becomes infected. Infected trees must be destroyed. Once the disease becomes established, control and prevention measures for plum pox include field surveys, use of certified nursery materials, control of aphids, and elimination of infected trees in nurseries and orchards.\n\nSources of resistance exist in \"Prunus\", but are not common. A team of scientists from the United States and France has genetically engineered a plum pox-resistant plum called C5, and the resistance can be transferred through hybridization to other plum trees. The transgenic plum expresses a plum pox virus coat protein, the plant produces the coat protein mRNA and it is processed by a system called post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), which functions like the plants' immune system and is mechanistically similar to RNAi. C5 provides a unique source of germplasm for future breeding programs worldwide. Similar success has not yet occurred in attempt to genetically modify other \"Prunus\" species, although these efforts are ongoing.\n\nIn the fall of 1999, plum pox strain PPV-D was detected in an Adams County, Pennsylvania orchard. This was the first time that plum pox had been found in North America. The infected areas in Pennsylvania have been quarantined to prevent the spread of the disease, and infected trees have been destroyed.\n\nSince this time, as a result of random surveying done in 2000, detection has also occurred in Nova Scotia and in Southern Ontario, particularly in the Niagara Region. Like the United States infection, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has put into effect quarantine zones throughout Southern Ontario in a bid to prevent the spread of PPV. The virus has yet to be found in other areas of Canada which contain susceptible trees despite intense surveying. The Canadian plum pox eradication initiative has involved large numbers of samples tested for the plum pox virus. Samples are tested through a technology known as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The University of Guelph - Laboratory Services Division has performed over 4,000,000 tests in the past 7 years in support of this initiative.\n\nHost preference of the major strains of Plum pox virus—Opinions based on regional and world-wide sequence data\nN Sihelská\nJournal of Integrative Agriculture 16(3):510\nElsevier 2017\n2095-3119\n\n"}

With writer Arnold Drake, he co-created that company's superhero team the Doom Patrol.\n\nThe son of a Slovenian Imperial Railway employee and an Italian mother, Bruno Premiani was born in Trieste, in what was then Austria-Hungary. It became part of Italy by the time Premiami studied at the city's arts and crafts high school from 1921 to 1925. He became a political cartoonist in his maturity, and was expelled from the country for his anti-Benito Mussolini work. He emigrated to Argentina in 1930, but where he worked for the Agencia Wisner advertising agency and the daily newspaper \"Crítica\", for which he did the 1932-1940 educational comic section \"Seen and Heard\". Italy's Fascist government during this time kept track of Premiani's \"Critica\" work, and decreed he would be arrested if he returned to Italy. Premiani did return to attend his mother's funeral in 1950, years after the Fascist regime had toppled.\n\nThrough the 1940s, Premiani drew for such Argentine publications as \"Léoplan\" and the children's magazine \"Billiken\". In 1947, he began illustrating \"Patoruzito Classics\" comics-adaptations of literary works for comics artist Dante Quinterno's 1945 \"Patoruzito\" comic book. However, as he had with Mussolini, Premiani similarly ran afoul of Juan Perón.\n\nMoving to the United States, where he lived from 1948 to 1952, Premiani found work with DC Comics, beginning as penciler-inker of the four-page Gantry Daniels biography \"The Sun-Born Mountain Man\" in \"World's Finest Comics\" #42 (cover-dated Oct. 1949). Comic book creators were not routinely given credits during this era, and historians have tentatively identified Premiani art in a number of Prize Comics titles, starting with the eight-page \"Love-Sick Weakling\" in \"Western Love\" #2 (Oct. 1949).\n\nFor DC, Premiani penciled and generally also inked his own work for such features as \"Johnny Peril\" in \"All-Star Comics\" #52 (May 1950), and \"Pow-Wow Smith, Indian Lawman\" in \"Detective Comics\" #163 (Sept. 1950). He then became regular artist for the American Revolution-era frontiersman hero Tomahawk after that character's feature in \"Star-Spangled Comics\" was awarded its own title, beginning with \"Tomahawk\" #1 (Oct. 1950). Premiani published two more stories in Prize Comics' horror title \"Black Magic\" before devoting himself almost exclusively to \"Tomahawk\", drawing the hero's six- to eight-page stories in all but two issues (#27, #30) in a run through issue #36 (Nov. 1955). He also drew Tomahawk stories in \"World's Finest Comics\" #73-75 & 79 (Dec. 1954 - April 1955 & Dec. 1955).\n\nAs well this decade, Premiani was the author of the illustrated book \"El Caballo\", published in 1957, a source of information about the anatomy and history of the horse for artists.\n\nWith writer France Herron, Premiani co-created Cave Carson, a spelunker/geologist adventurer, in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #31 (Sept. 1960).\n\nPremiani most notably drew the original incarnations of the Doom Patrol in 1963 and the Teen Titans in 1964, both series being cult favorites that have survived in one form or another, if sporadically, since their original creation for the DC Comics universe. In the case of the former superhero team, editor Murray Boltinoff had asked writer Arnold Drake to develop a feature to run in the anthology series \"My Greatest Adventure\". Given the assignment on a Friday with a script due that Tuesday, Drake conceived what would become the Doom Patrol, and turned to another DC writer, Bob Haney, to co-plot and co-script the first adventure. Premiani designed the characters. Drake would subsequently script every Doom Patrol story, with Premiani drawing virtually all, from the team's debut in \"My Greatest Adventure\" #80 (June 1963) through the series retitling to \"The Doom Patrol\" with issue #86 (March 1964), to the final issue of its initial run, #121 (Oct. 1968). Premiani and Boltinoff appeared as themselves in that final story, discussing the impending demise of the team.\n\nIn 2001, Drake wrote of the search for a \"Doom Patrol\" illustrator, saying that Boltinoff's regular artists\nPremiani drew proto-teamings of the as-yet-unnamed Teen Titans beginning with the Kid Flash-Aqualad-Robin adventure \"The Thousand-and-One Dooms of Mr. Twister\" in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #54 (July 1964).\n\nAdditionally, in the early 1960s, Premiani freelanced for the Gilberton Company's \"Classics Illustrated\", \"Classics Illustrated Special Issue\", and \"World Around Us\" series. His major project was the painted cover and complete interior art for \"Classics Illustrated\" No. 156, \"The Conquest of Mexico\" (May 1960), based on Bernal Diaz del Castillo's eyewitness account of the fall of the Aztec empire. In addition, he contributed sections to two \"Special Issues\", \"The Atomic Age\" (June 1960) and \"The United Nations\" (1964). Most of Premiani's work for Gilberton was for the educational \"World Around Us\" line, for which he provided chapters in \"The Crusades\" (December 1959), \"Festivals\" (January 1960), \"Great Scientists\" (February 1960), \"Communications\" (April 1960), \"Whaling\" (December 1960), and \"The Vikings\" (January 1961).\n\nPremiani's last known original comics story was the three-and-a-half-page \"Please Let Me Die\", written by Dave Wood, in \"The Unexpected\" #126 (Aug. 1971).\n\nPremiani died in Argentina, on August 17, 1984.\n"}

It was written by Krishna Das Kaviraja (b. 1496), primarily in the Bengali language, but also including a great number of Sanskrit verses within its devotional, poetic construction, including \"Siksastakam\". Intertwined with the stories of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's life are philosophical conversations detailing the process of Bhakti yoga, with special attention given to congregational chanting of Krishna's names and the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra.\n\nThe Chaitanya Caritamrta is divided into three sections: the Adi-lila, Madhya-lila and Antya-lila. Each section refers to a particular phase in Shri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's life:\n\nThe Adi-lila explains Caitanya's unique theological identity as an Avatar of Krishna in the mood of Radharani (a combined avatar of both personalities), his personal lineage, his closest childhood companions and their paramparas (disciplic succession), and the characters of his devotional associates. This section ends with a brief summary of Caitanya's life up to his acceptance of sannyasa (the renounced order of life).\n\nIn the conversation with Chand Kazi the word 'hindu' is used repeatedly for inhabitants of Nabadwip who were not Muslims.\n\nThe Madhya-lila details Caitanya Mahaprabhu's sannyasa pastimes; the life of Madhavendra Puri; a philosophical conversation with the Advaitin scholar Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya (wherein the supremacy of bhakti is promoted by Mahaprabhu against the arguments of impersonal advaita); Caitanya’s pilgrimage to South India; examples of the daily and annual activities of Caitanya and his devotees during the Ratha-yatra festival of Jagannatha near the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha; their observance of other festivities; and his detailed instructions on the process of Bhakti Yoga to both Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami.\n\nAlthough the author, Krishna Dasa Kaviraja, never met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu personally, his guru Raghunatha dasa Goswami (1494–1586 CE) was an associate of Chaitanya and was close to others who were intimates of his. In composing his work, Krishna Dasa Kaviraja also referred to the \"shrIkr^ShNachaitanyacharaNAmr^ta\" of Murari Gupta and also the works of Svarupa Damodara, both of whom knew Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nKrishna Dasa Kaviraja composed the Chaitanya Charitamrita in his old age after being requested by the Vaishnavas of Vrindavana to write a hagiography about the life of Chaitanya. Although there was already a biography written by Vrindavana Dasa, called the Chaitanya Bhagavata, the later years of Chaitanya’s life were not detailed in that work. Krishna Dasa’s Chaitanya Charitamrita covers Chaitanya’s later years and also explains in detail the rasa philosophy that Chaitanya and his followers expounded. The Chaitanya Charitamrita also serves as a compendium of Gaudiya Vaishnava practices and outlines the Gaudiya theology developed by the Goswamis in metaphysics, ontology and aesthetics.\n\nThe Chaitanya Charitamrita was frequently copied and widely circulated amongst the Vaishnava communities of Bengal and Odisha during the early 17th Century. Its popularity during this period can be attributed to the propagation of three Vaishnava preachers called Narottama Dasa, Shyamananda and Srinivasa who were trained by Jiva Goswami and Krishna Dasa Kaviraja himself.\n\nIn the 1970s Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati’s disciple A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder acharya of ISKCON (also known as the Hare Krishna movement), popularised the Caitanya Caritamrta in the West. He published a deluxe 17-volume English edition of the work through his Bhaktivedanta Book Trust with his own commentary based upon the Amrita Pravaha and Anubhasya commentaries of Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. This edition has been distributed in mass quantities worldwide and is the best-known and most influential English-language edition of Caitanya Caritamrta today.\n\n\n"}

The film was directed by Nancy Meckler and written by Wendy Kesselman, based on her own play, \"My Sister in This House.\" Both the play and the subsequent film deal with societal repression and its victims.\n\nThe film is based on a true incident in Le Mans, France in 1933 called the Papin murder case, where two sisters brutally murdered their employer and her daughter. The murder shocked the country, and there was much speculation about the sisters, including allegations that they were having an incestous lesbian affair.\n\nIn 1933 France, Christine (Richardson) is the maid of a well-to-do middle-aged widow (Julie Walters) and her teenage daughter (Sophie Thursfield). Her younger sister, Lea (May) is hired on the recommendation of Christine. The two sisters become increasingly alienated from their employer, separated by barriers between the classes.

{"id": "2179508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179508", "title": "Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)", "text": "Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)\n\nThe Battle of Cape St. Vincent was a naval encounter off Cape St. Vincent between a Liberal fleet under the command of British naval officer Charles Napier against a Miguelite fleet under the command of Portugese naval officer Manuel Marreiros, which was fought on 5 July 1833 during the Liberal Wars and resulted in a decisive victory for the Liberal fleet. Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any ships of the line compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, board their ships and engage in hand-to-hand combat. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former Royal Navy personnel that had been discharged and sought service under Pedro I of Brazil. The battle resulted in four Miguelite ships of the line, one frigate and one corvette being captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreating from the engagement. The action took place in context of the Liberal Wars, a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a pretender named Don Miguel, whose supporters were called Miguelites. The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St. Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the Battle of the Tagus on 11 July 1831 against a French fleet led by Albin Roussin. The Miguelite-held Lisbon, deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.\n\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the Azores, Napier had become acquainted with some exiled Portuguese liberals, who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some East Indiamen purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain George Rose Sartorius, who was already serving as Admiral of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in English, was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the Napoleonic Wars when he captured the French-held island of Ponza in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the Douro River off Oporto.\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in Oporto by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as Vice Admiral, Major General of the Portuguese Navy and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the frigate \"Rainha de Portugal\", commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson Charles Elers Napier as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the Duke of Terceira and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the Algarve so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture Lisbon. After successfully disembarking this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off Cape St. Vincent on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.\n\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier’s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a corvette, a brig and a schooner, mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as tugs, but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the Miguelite fleet which consisted four ships of the line, a frigate, a xebec, three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to board and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his flagship leading the manoeuvre, the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British veterans from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to Don Pedro. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or Madeira. Napier’s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of \"Rainha de Portugal\" and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel António Marreiros. \n\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by cholera outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira’s army advancing from the south at the Battle of Almada, a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the peerage of Portugal. Napier visited Rear-Admiral Sir William Parker who happened to be in the vicinity of the Tagus, and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Royal Navy List at the insistence of the French, he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews, was viewed in the United Kingdom as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the apogee of its success during the preceding Napoleonic Wars. \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833. For these services he was made Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword, and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite \"The Lord of the Isles\" steamer at Sao Martinho and in 1836 defended his prize in the Court of Common Pleas. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the Minho region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the Battle of Asseiceira, fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars. The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at Evoramonte, a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which Dom Miguel formally renounced all claims to the throne of Portugal, was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. Dom Pedro restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Glória resumed her interrupted reign as Maria II of Portugal, until she finally passed away in 1853.\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the restored Portuguese parliament. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth parliamentary seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2179520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179520", "title": "Dimapur", "text": "Dimapur\n\nDimapur is a city in Nagaland, India. It is the most populous city in Nagaland and also the most densely populated city in the state with an estimated population of about 250,000. The city is the main gateway and commercial centre of Nagaland. \n\nLocated near the border with Assam along the banks of the Dhansiri River, Dimapur is the only plains tract of hilly Nagaland and also has the only railway station and airport in the state for connectivity and economic activity.\n\nThe name Dimapur is derived from the Kachari language; \"Di\" means \"water\", \"ma\" means \"large\" and \"pur\" (sanskritised word) means \"city\", translating to \"Big-river-city\", associated with the meaning of \"Kachari\" which is \"people of the river valley\" and after the river which flows through it (Dhansiri).\n\nThere are two accounts of the way in which Dimapur got its name : many writers are of the opinion that the name 'Dimapur' was derived from Dimasa Kachari words Di-meaning water, Ma-meaning big and Pur-meaning city or township in the Dimasa dialect; while others contend that Dimapur is a corruption of Hidimbapur, meaning the city of Hidimbi (of Mahabharata fame) - the rakshasi-turned-woman whose marriage to the Pandava prince Bhima led to the birth of Ghatotkacha, believed to be the progenitor of the Kacharis. According to the second theory, the name Hidimbapur is conjectured to have been abbreviated to Dimbapur and subsequently to have lost a consonant to become Dimapur. In some accounts preserved in Dimasa Kachari folklore Dimapur is called Dimabang Halali, possibly an earlier name of the city, later Sanskritised. In the Ahom Chronicles, Dimapur Is referred to sometimes as ‘Che-din-chi-pen’ (town-earth-burn-make) meaning ‘brick town’ and at others as 'Che-Dima’ meaning 'town of the Dimasa'.\n\nSituated on the banks of the Dhansiri (originally known as Dong-siri meaning a ravine of peaceful habitation), Dimapur, often described as the ‘Brick City’ by European scholars and also by the Ahoms, was the ancient capital of the Dimasa Kachari community and an independent nation of the Dimasa, who were once a powerful and predominant race in the entire North-East India region (Brahmaputra/Dilao Valley).\n\nAccording to popular belief, the city's formation in Nagaland is separate from that of Assam. In the Middle Ages, it was the capital of the Kachari Kingdom. In the heart of the town there is an old relic of the Kachari Kingdom which speaks about the once prosperous era. \n\nThe seat of capital of Dimapur Kingdom was originally enclosed by a brick wall four feet wide and sixteen feet high, surrounded by an outer ditch sixteen feet in width and twelve feet in depth, except on the southern side where the River Dhansiri formed a natural moat. On the eastern side, there was a fine solid gateway with brick masonry of pointed double arches. The gate was secured by heavy double doors, the hinges of which were seated in holes pierced in solid stone blocks. At both ends of the battlement there were turrets of half quadrant shape and in between the archway and the turrets were niches resembling ornamental windows. High up, on either side of the arch, were carvings of sunflowers, which were originally faced with brass so as to present a dazzling spectacle when seen sparkling in the sun from afar. Edward Albert Gait said of the brick structures of Dimapur that they showed the Kacharis' civilization to be further advanced than that shown by the timber and mud plaster constructions of the Ahoms. Dimapur marked a progressive point in the history of the lineage of the Mech/Mechha Dynasty (un-sanskritised heritage of the Kacharis).\n\nInside the fortified city, there were seventeen ornamental stone pillars. These funerary monuments were decorated with carvings of foliage, flowers, familiar animals \nand birds. These monoliths are believed to be lineal monuments of the ruling kings of Dimapur. The largest of them was seventeen feet high and twenty-four feet in circumference and was said to be the memorial of Makardhwaj, greatest of the rulers of Dimapur (to be equated probably with Khungkradoa Raja, in whose time the Dimasa Kachari Kingdom reached its apogee. It was during this golden age that the conquests of Manipur and Burma took place under the leadership of Sengyah (Veer) Demalu Kemprai, the greatest warlord of the Kacharis. Also during this period, heroes like Rangadao (after whom Ranga Pathar, the southern part of Dimapur, was named), Degadao and mystic heroines like Wairingma and Waibangma won renown in war and the pursuit of mystical attainment. Other V-shaped stone monuments, seventeen in number, symbolised the seventeen royal clans of the 'Dimasa Kachari Aristocracy’ a term coined by Dr. Francis Hamilton, a renowned scholar of the Dimasa Kachari Royal Clan.\n\nShri SK. Barpujari in his book \"History of the Dimasa\" and some other writers opined that the Dimasa Kachari Kings to commemorate their Victory over other tribesmen, erected monoliths of different shapes indicating the different traditions of the vanquished tribes. This tradition of carving victory memorials is part of the culture of the hill tribes and may have been adopted by the Dimasa Kachari Kings in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of their rule. Dr H. Bareh in the \"Gazetteer of India\" writes that the oblong V-Shaped stone pillars closely correspond to the similarly V-Shaped post protruding from the roof of the house of wealthy Angamis, who are said to have adopted the practice.\n\nThe tallest and largest megalith, which lies isolated from others and has a unique Sultanate style, is believed to have been erected by the founder king of Dimapur, who after vanquishing the tribes all around made his triumphal tower to commemorate his victory and this became a tradition setter. In and around this old city, large number of tanks over 50 in number existed, although most of them have since either dried up or have been destroyed by reckless human encroachment without an iota of respect for the history. These tanks are believed to be dug by the kings for providing water supply to their people. Most of large tanks are rectangular and have a hardwood seasoned poles planted deep at the centre of the tanks, which have lasted for hundreds of years. Others are of irregular shapes without any such wooden poles. Inference in that, the former ones might have been dug by the kings for water supply and the later were habitation as 'Digjo Dijua' meaning 'cut off from main river or stream’ and this tradition is still in vogue, and this area covers Dimapur and Dimasa Kachari inhabited areas of Karbi Anglong District of Assam in the Dhansiri Valley. The present Dimapur is the commercial capital of Nagaland and is one of the fastest growing townships in the entire North-east region. But irony is, in the name of the modernity and development, this ancient city of Dimapur, whose historical relics finds a place in the World.\n\nDuring World War II, Dimapur was the centre of action between British India and Imperial Japan. It was the staging post for the Allied offensive. The Japanese could reach Kohima where a siege was laid. Allied reinforcement came through Dimapur by rail and road for the push against the Japanese. An airport at Dimapur was also in use for supplies to the allied forces in Burma. The battle for Kohima about 77 km from Dimapur is considered the turning point for the Japanese retreat from South East Asia.\n\nThe Jains were amongst the earliest non-Naga settlers of Nagaland. A few Jain families came to Kohima in the 1880s and settled there. They later moved to Dimapur in 1944 due to Japanese invasion during World War II. Prominent among them were Phulchand Sethi, Udayram Chabra, Mangilal Chabra, Phulchand Binaykia, Jethmal Sethi, Ramchandra Sethi, Bhajanlal Sethi, Kanhaiyal Sethi, Nathmal Sethi etc. Phulchand Sethi, Bhajanlal Sethi and other Sethi and Chabra brethren set up the SD Jain Temple, SD Jain School, SD Jain Charitable Hospital. Kanhaiyalal Sethi, Phulchand Sethi, and his brothers also built the Durga Mandir in Old Daily Market.\n\nPresent-day Dimapur has far outgrown its old town area (up to the old Dhansiri bridge, under reconstruction in 2017). It is one contiguous urban sprawl from the Assam border at Dilai gate and newfield checkgate up to the foothills of Chümoukedima, the designated district headquarters of Dimapur district.\n\nAfter the statehood was given a new interim body was set up whereby the Kacharis were given representation in the form of membership in the government body. The Kacharis were asked to nominate their member a qualified person could be found and hence they brought in a person from the Bodo (Mech), sub-tribe of the Great Kachari Family, late Shri Deblal Mech (a Bodo Kachari), to represent the people. The Kacharis are mostly in the Dimapur III constituency of the state, where total voters would be around 20,000; these consist of Dimasa Kachari, Bodo/Mech Kachari, Garo, Kuki and others, including Naga tribes like Angamis, Kyong (Lotha), Chakhesangs, Sumis, etc. Dimasas Kacharis or Kacharis honestly enrolled in the electoral roll the exact eligible voters whereas many other communities inflated their numbers very largely. At present, Dimasa Kacharis' live alongside other Kachari sub-tribes and the Naga community in Dimapur, and the Kachari community as a whole is considered as one of the indigenous community of Nagaland. The Kacharis are mostly found in the Dhansiripar Subdivision, Kachari Gaon, Diphupar, Ranga Pathar, etc.\n\nDimapur is located in the southeast of Nagaland. The vast majority of this area is flat with the Dhansiri River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River flowing east of the city. \n\nDimapur is hot and humid in summers and moderately cold in winters.\n\n the census of 2011 the city-population of the old Town Committee area (up to the old dhansiri bridge) at 122,834. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Dimapur has an average literacy rate of 86% male literacy is 88% and, female literacy is 84%. In Dimapur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\nUnlike other places in the state, this city has a heterogeneous mix of people from all over India, and for which it is also known as \"mini India.\" \n\nBesides the dominant Naga tribes who comprise about 50% of the city's population, other prominent groups include Bengalis, Assamese, Oriyas, Nepalese, Biharis, Meiteis, Kacharis, Kukis, Marwaris, Punjabis and also Tamils and Keralites. In the last two decades Tibetan traders have also settled in the city.\n\nChristianity is the most popular religion in Dimapur, making up 45% of the city population and Hinduism nearly as popular at 41% of the population. Islam is followed by 11%, and Jainism by 1.7%.\n\n\nAlthough is left in ruins after centuries of abandonment, after facing conflict with the Ahom King in 18th century and with the settlement of township occupying almost half of its former glorious fortress, is still a national heritage site. It signifies great historical importance for the region of North-East. It also gives great value to the state of Nagaland.\n\n\nThe Dimapur Jain Temple was built in 1947. The temple has some intricate glass work. The temple is considered very auspicious by the people of Dimapur. The temple was built by the tireless effort of Shri Subhkaran Sethi, Shri Phulchand Sethi, Shri Jethmal Sethi, Shri Udayram Chabra, Shri Chunnilal Kishanlal Sethi, Shri Kanhaiyal Sethi, and other Jain families present in Dimapur at that time.\n\nDimapur has several places where tourist can visit such as Green Park, Aqua Mellow park, Zoological Garden, Science Center, Stone Park, Hazi Park, Agri Expo site, Rangapahar Forest, Triple Falls, Shiv Mandir, Loinloom Festival and Kali Temple.\n\n\nDimapur is served by the Dimapur Airport which is located at 3rd mile (AH-1). It is the only civil airport in the state and operates routes to Kolkata,\nGuwahati, Imphal, and Dibrugarh. \n\nThere are plans for expansion of the airport to meet international norms by buying land at Aoyimti village.\n\nDimapur is the only city in Nagaland that is connected by both rail and air. There are direct train services to cities like Guwahati, Kolkata, New Delhi, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Dibrugarh and Chennai from the Dimapur railway station. The station is categorised as an A category railway station which lies on the Lumding-Dibrugarh section under the Lumding railway division of Northeast Frontier Railway.\n\nAlthough Dimapur accounts for only about 9% of the state, it is the commercial centre of Nagaland.\n\nA number of shopping centers and markets have sprung up in Dimapur, with the Hong Kong Market, Central Plaza, New Market, Bank colony (Super Market Area) and Circular and NL roads serving as the main commercial areas in the city. The Complexes and shopping centres have sprung up to Nuton Bosti. \n\nThe stretch from Purana Bazar to Chümoukedima along the AH-1 is also rapidly developing into commercial areas.\n\nThe city's Hong Kong Market is well known for imported goods from Thailand, China, and Burma and is the main Shopping Attraction for Tourists visiting Nagaland. The wholesale foodgrain items are available at KL Sethi Market Complex, Jasokie Market etc. at G S Road, Dimapur.\n\nThe Nagaland Industrial Growth Centre is situated at Ganeshnagar of Dhansiripar Sub-Division, where most of the Dimasa Kacharis lived — an area consisting of seven Dimasa Villages (Dhansiripar, Disaguphu, Amaluma, Doyapur, Ganeshnagar, Hazadisa, and Manglumukh).\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first Christie novel to be given a different title for the US market.

The spirit tells them that Captain Trevelyan is dead. The roads being impassible to vehicles, Major Burnaby announces his intention to go to the village on foot to check on his friend, where he appears to find the prediction has come true. Emily Trefusis, engaged to Trevelyan's nephew, uncovers the mystery along with the police.\n\nThe novel was well-received, with praise for the character Miss Emily Trefusis. The references to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, no longer alive when the book was published, and the elements of the setting that hearken to \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (published in 1902) were also noted and appreciated.\n\nSittaford is a tiny village on the fringe of Dartmoor. Mrs Willett and her daughter Violet are the newly installed tenants of Sittaford House, a residence owned by Trevelyan, a retired Navy captain. They invite four people to tea on Friday afternoon: Captain Trevelyan's long-standing friend, Major Burnaby, Mr Rycroft, Mr Ronnie Garfield, and Mr Duke. At the suggestion of Mr Garfield, the six of them decide to play a game of table-turning. During this séance, at 5.25 pm, a spirit announces that Captain Trevelyan has just been murdered. Concerned for the Captain's safety in Exhampton, Major Burnaby says that he intends to walk the six miles there. There is a thick layer of snow on the ground and further heavy snowfall is forecast for later that evening. There is no telephone in Sittaford, and cars cannot manoeuvre in these conditions.\n\nTwo and a half hours later, just before 8 pm, in the middle of a blizzard, Major Burnaby is trudging up the path to the front door of Hazelmoor, the house in Exhampton where Captain Trevelyan now lives. When nobody answers the door, he fetches the local police and a doctor. They enter the house through the open study window at the back, and find Captain Trevelyan's dead body on the floor. Dr Warren estimates the time of death at between 5 and 6 pm. A fracture of the base of the skull is the cause of death. The weapon was a green baize tube full of sand.\n\nCaptain Trevelyan's will states that, apart from £100 for his servant Evans, his property is to be equally divided among four people: his sister Jennifer Gardner, his nephew James Pearson, his niece Sylvia Dering, and his nephew Brian Pearson (the three children of his other, deceased sister). Each of these four will inherit approximately £20,000. James Pearson is arrested for murder because he was in Exhampton at the time of the murder, trying unsuccessfully to get a loan from Captain Trevelyan.\n\nWhile the official investigation is led by Inspector Narracott, James Pearson's fiancée Emily Trefusis starts sleuthing herself. She is assisted by Charles Enderby, a \"Daily Wire\" journalist who, after the murder, presented a cheque for £5,000 to Major Burnaby for winning the newspaper's football competition in Exhampton. Emily and Charles stay with Mr and Mrs Curtis in Sittaford, searching for clues. Mr Dacres, James Pearson's solicitor, tells Emily that things look much worse than they already imagined. James has \"borrowed\" money from his firm to speculate in stocks without the knowledge of the firm.\n\nThere are several red herrings. Brian Pearson came under suspicion when Enderby discovered him making a late-night rendezvous with Violet Willett; he is Violet's fiancé. He was not in Australia but had returned to England on the same boat with the Willetts. The Willetts' motive for moving into the isolated Sittaford house had no connection with Captain Trevelyan. They wanted to live close to Dartmoor Prison, where Violet's father was imprisoned. His escape from the prison three days after the murder was engineered by Brian Pearson. He and Brian would live with the Willetts as their manservants until the danger was past, but the prisoner was recaptured. Martin Dering created a false alibi because his wife Sylvia was watching him for divorce proceedings. Sylvia is Mr Rycroft's niece; Jennifer Gardner is Mr Garfield's godmother; and Mr Duke is an ex-Chief-Inspector of Scotland Yard.\n\nEmily solves the mystery in Hazelmoor after finding Captain Trevelyan's ski boots hidden in the chimney, and two pairs of skis in different sizes. Major Burnaby is the killer. He engineered the table movements during the séance to make the spirit convey the message that Captain Trevelyan had been murdered. Instead of walking the six miles in two and a half hours after the séance, he went to his own house to put on skis, and skied the distance in about 10 minutes. He killed Captain Trevelyan at about a quarter to six. Then he cleaned his skis and put them in the cupboard. He hid Trevelyan's ski boots in the chimney to prevent the police seeing them, and thus possibly realising how quickly a person on skis could have travelled between Sittaford and Exhampton. Major Burnaby hoped that the second pair of skis, of a different size, would pass unnoticed.\n\nMr Rycroft, who is a member of the Psychical Research Society, reassembles five of the six original participants for a second séance at Sittaford House, the absent Mr Duke being replaced by Brian Pearson. The séance has scarcely begun, when Inspector Narracott steps in, in the company of Emily and Mr Duke, and charges Major Burnaby with the murder of Captain Trevelyan. Emily explains that Burnaby had lost a lot of money by buying rotten shares; his motive for the murder was to keep the cheque for £5,000. He had received the letter notifying him of the win on the morning of the day of the murder, contrary to what he told Enderby. Captain Trevelyan had won the competition but used Burnaby's name to send in competition solutions. In the final chapter Emily turns down a marriage proposal by Enderby – who has fallen in love with her during the investigation – because she still loves her fiancé James.\n\n\n\n\n\"The Sittaford Mystery\" was the first Christie book not to be reviewed by the \"Times Literary Supplement\".\n\n\"The New York Times Book Review\"'s issue of 16 August 1931 posited that \"Mrs. Agatha Christie's latest is up to her usual high standard and compares favourably with \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\", one of the best she ever did.\" They went on to comment that, \"Miss Trefusis is one of the sharpest and most likeable detectives of recent moons.\" Finally they summarised, \"An excellent book to take away for week-end reading.\"\n\nIn a short review of 23 October 1931, the \"Daily Mirror\" said that, \"A pair of snow shoes and a prize competition offer clues to the villain, who is well concealed.\"\n\nRobert Barnard: \"Mayhem Parva, sharpened by Dartmoor setting and snow. Many of the usual elements are here, but also escaped convict (out of \"Baskervilles\"), séances, newspaper competitions and amateur investigator – young woman torn (as in \"Blue Train\") between handsome weakling and hardworking, upright, born-to-success type. Highly entertaining, with adroit clueing.\"\n\nCharles Osborne: \"... strongly plotted, and the solution to its puzzles are not likely to be arrived at by deduction on the reader's part. It is also one of Mrs. Christie's most entertaining crime novels, and her use of the Dartmoor background is masterly.\"\n\n\"The Sittaford Mystery\" contains several references to \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" by Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\n'Exhampton' is readily recognisable as Okehampton. There is a Sittaford Tor on Dartmoor, which gave Christie the name. The physical location of her fictional settlement of Sittaford closely matches that of Belstone, but its description also evokes Throwleigh where Christie owned a house.\n\n\nIn the US the novel was serialised in \"Good Housekeeping\" magazine in six instalments from March (Volume XCII, Number 3) to August 1931 (Volume XCIII, Number 2) under the title \"The Murder at Hazelmoor\" with illustrations by W. Smithson Broadhead.\n\nThe book's dedication reads: \"To M.E.M. With whom I discussed the plot of this book to the alarm of those around us.\" The subject of this dedication is Christie's second husband, Max Mallowan (1904–1978) and is one of four books dedicated to him, either singly or jointly, the others being \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1934), \"Come Tell Me How You Live (1946)\" and Christie's final written work, \"Postern of Fate\" (1973).\n\nIn 1928, Christie had been planning a holiday to the West Indies when a chance conversation at a dinner party with a Commander Howe of the Royal Navy and his wife, who had just returned from his being stationed in the Persian Gulf, awakened an interest in her in visiting Baghdad, especially when the Howes pointed out that a part of the journey could be made by the famed Orient Express. The Howes also mentioned that not far from Baghdad, an archaeological expedition was uncovering the remains of the ancient city of Ur, about which Christie had been reading with avid interest in \"The Illustrated London News\". Entranced by the thought of such a journey, she changed her tickets at Thomas Cook's and set off for the orient.\n\nOn the journey, she found herself in the company of a tedious Englishwoman who was determined to take Christie \"under her wing\", although that was the last thing she wanted. Desperate to escape she travelled to Ur and made the acquaintance of the archaeological expedition's leader, Leonard Woolley (1880–1960) and his wife, Katharine (1888–1945). Visitors to the dig were usually discouraged but Katharine Woolley was a great admirer of \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" and, being an imperious and difficult woman who always got her way in things large and small (Gertrude Bell described Katherine as \"dangerous\"), Christie was treated as an honoured guest. In 1929, Christie gave the Woolleys the temporary use of her then residence in Cresswell Place in London and they, in turn, invited her back to the dig at the end of the season.\n\nArriving back there in February 1930, she met Max Mallowan, who had been away ill with appendicitis. Katharine 'ordered' him to take Christie on a tour of the local sights. They visited Nippur, Diwaniyah, Nejeif, Ukhaidir, and Kerbela and on a journey back to Baghdad, their car got stuck in the sand. Mallowan was impressed by the way in which Christie, rather than succumbing to panic in the heat and dust, just lay down in the car's shadow to sleep while a Bedouin went off for help. After being reunited with the Woolleys, most of the party made its way by stages to Greece where Christie received telegrams informing her that her daughter Rosalind (who was in the care of her sister at Abney Hall), was seriously ill with pneumonia. Christie set off for home by a four-day train journey with Max accompanying her. Getting to know her on the journey, he made up his mind to propose marriage and, after a few more meetings, that is what he did to Christie's great shock.\n\nChristie accepted and in doing so was warned to be cautious by her brother-in-law James Watts (1878?–1957) and vehemently opposed in her plans by his wife (Christie's sister) Madge (1879–1950). Their son, Jack Watts (1903–1961) who had been at New College, Oxford with Max was also opposed, supposedly due to mistrust of his new 'uncle'. As \"The Sittaford Mystery\" was written during this period, it is probable that this opposition is what the dedication refers to.\n\nThe blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads:\n\nIt was a typical Dickens Christmas; deep snow everywhere, and down in the little village of Sittaford on the fringe of Dartmoor, probably deeper than anywhere. Mrs Willett, the winter tenant in Captain Trevelyan's country house, was, with her daughter Violet, giving a party. Finally they decided to do a little table rapping and after the usual number of inconsequential messages from the 'other side', suddenly the table announced that Captain Trevelyan was dead. His oldest friend, Captain Burnaby, was disturbed. He quickly left the house and tramped six miles of snowy roads to Exhampton. There was no sign of life in Trevelyan's house. A back window was broken in and the light was burning – and there, on the floor, was the body of Trevelyan. Inspector Narracott took the case in hand, and after wandering through a maze of false clues and suspects, he ultimately discovered the murderer of Captain Trevelyan. Mrs. Christie has never formulated a more ingenious or enthralling plot and her characterisation is of the vivid type which marked \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" and \"The Murder at the Vicarage\".\n\nThe novel was adapted by Granada Television as a Miss Marple mystery as part of the \"Agatha Christie's Marple\" series (set in 1952). It featured Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple and guest-starred Timothy Dalton as Trevelyan, Patricia Hodge as Mrs Evadne Willett, Carey Mulligan as Violet Willett, Laurence Fox as Jim Pearson, Zoe Telford as Emily Trefusis, James Murray as Charles Burnaby, Mel Smith as John Enderby and Rita Tushingham as Elizabeth Percehouse. It aired in the UK on 30 April 2006. However, apart from the names of some of the characters and locations, the plot bears little resemblance to the original story. Also, Miss Marple is added in the story though the book is not about her.\n\nA five-part radio adaptation was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1990 featuring Melinda Walker as Emily Trefusis, Stephen Tompkinson as Charles Enderby, John Moffatt as Mr Rycroft and Geoffrey Whitehead as Inspector Narracott.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179540", "title": "Starblazer", "text": "Starblazer\n\nStarblazer - Space Fiction Adventure in Pictures was a British small-format comics anthology in black and white published by D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd.\n\nThe comic book magazine was launched in response to the popularity of science fiction in the 1970s at the cinema and on television. A science fiction comic had first been considered by Ian Chisholm and Jack Smith, editors at DC Thomson, in 1976. A decision was made to launch the comic in September 1978. Smith was the first editor. His successors in the role were Bill Graham and Bill McLoughlin.\n\n\"Starblazer\" reached 281 issues, running from April 1979, to 1 January 1991. The front cover was printed in colour while the back page featured an ongoing subject that was relevant to space. This included pictures of astronauts, brief details of the missions they were on, artificial satellites and the planets and planetoids of the solar system. The first three issues were published monthly, changing to two issues a month from issue four until the last issue in 1991.\n\nPartway through its run, from issue 168 onwards, the anthology changed format. Instead of a single front cover and a black and white subject on the back, a new all-colour 'wrap around' cover was instituted, most of the time showing a collage of subjects from that issue's storyline. The subject matters also appeared to have a more adult emphasis and there was a heavier focus on fantasy storylines. The cover title also changed format slightly to Starblazer - Fantasy Fiction in Pictures; despite the title change, there were still a considerable number of science fiction storylines up till the final issue.\n\nPrior to the new format, there had been several issues that had been classed as interactive fiction, with the title Starblazer - Space (or Fantasy) roleplaying game in pictures similar in idea to the then popular Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf gamebooks, but this idea was quietly dropped after a few issues when it proved unpopular.\nThe \"Starblazer\" issues suffered from poor distribution, being rare in parts of Scotland and almost unknown in the rest of the United Kingdom. Due to a downturn in the general comic market, many newsagents never stocked them, or later would only take subscriptions. This contrasts sharply with the Commando comics from the same publisher that have enjoyed countrywide widespread distribution since their origin in the 1960s. Also, a slump in the science fiction genre affected the sales.\n\nIn May 2007 Cubicle 7 Entertainment announced that they were producing a licensed Starblazer role-playing game using the FATE 3.0 system. The game was released by Cubicle 7 in August 2008, at Gen Con Indianapolis, followed by a hard-cover edition in June 2009. In July 2009 it was nominated for three Ennies.\n\nAn exhibition was held in Dundee in 2009 to mark the 30th anniversary of the title and attracted comics creators like Alan Grant and Warren Ellis.\n\nBritish comics creators to have worked on \"Starblazer \"include Grant Morrison, Walter Cyril Henry Reed, John Smith, Mike Chinn, Mike McMahon, Colin MacNeil, Cam Kennedy, John Radford and John Ridgway. There were also a number of European and South American artists who did other work in British comics, such as Enrique Alcatena. Also Mike Knowles. Before the comic was launched he was one of a group of writers selected by D. C. Thomson to come up with stories for the comic.\n\nAlthough each issue was intended to be a 'one-off' storyline, a number of characters made reappearances in subsequent issues. The first of these was Matt Crane, who appeared in issue number 5, title \"The Shipeater\". He subsequently reappeared in issue 26, \"Alien Contact\".\n\nOther recurring characters include:\n\nHerne the Cosmic Outlaw. A mysterious warrior who is said to appear seemingly from nowhere to settle disputes in the 28th century. Herne was created by Grant Morrison.\n\nThe Suicide Squad. Not to be confused with the DC Comics group of the same name, this series of stories, by W. C. H. Reed, follows the team of Lieutenant Steve Martin and his squad of misfits. Martin himself apparently was disgraced and his active military career was finished. The remainder of his crew, Gunner Gee, Vidop (Computer operator) Bello, and Navigator Henry also had issues. The first appearance was in issue 49, titled \"Rigel Express\". Steve Martin was called Steven \"Terry\" in that issue. The Terry surname was also used in a couple of early pages in issue 75 (\"Doomrock\") but it changed by the end of that issue. Later issues used the Martin surname and no explanation was ever given for the change. As the issues went on, Martin became increasingly sickened by war, especially the human cost. Issue number 31, \"Starstrike\", featured a character called Steve Martin, though he is not the same character.\n\n\nThe Planet Tamer. Formerly known as Jubal McKay, a member of the United Planets Security Service who was rebuilt by cyberneticist Dr. Hans Verringer. The whole side of his body was practically destroyed by a bomb that had been planted by a criminal by the name of Trent. The resulting damage left him effectively unable to live a normal life. Verringer rebuilt his body, integrating weapons and computer systems into his suit. Completely self-sufficient in space, he had a sled built at a ship engineers that he can control remotely. Armed with a wide variety of weapons the Planet Tamer operates outside the normal jurisdiction of the law.\n\n\nMatt Tallis. One of the more irregular and short lived of the reused characters, Matt Tallis is an investigator/agent for the Galactic Security Service. He is stronger than the Earth normal, because his home world is a heavier gravity world. Tallis has his own ship, the Taurus, complete with a robot named Isak which can remotely control ship functions. Due to an implant that Tallis has, he can establish a telepathic style link with Isak.\n\n\nHadron Halley. A member of the Fi-Sci (Fighting Scientists), a part of Earths Galac Squad. The Fighting Scientists are a small group of scientists who are extremely intelligent, but also enter combat areas, having been fully trained in combat and survival techniques. Hadron Halley first appeared in issue number 50, \"Moonsplitter\", which also saw the first appearance of General Larz Pluto who would later become Halley's commanding officer and friend. Issue appearances are as follows.\n\n\nMikal R Kayn. A former police officer who was invalided out of the force after an explosion burned out his eyes. Without the aid of special glasses he can only see in the infrared spectrum. He eventually meets Cinnibar, a female warrior from the planet of Babalon, who helps him in a case to the abandoned research city of Valhalla Nova on the ice planet of Thrymheim. Kayns first appearance in issue 45 (\"Operation Overkill\") makes no mention of his accident, or his disability, only that he is a former law enforcement officer. However, it is the same character. Kayn was created by Grant Morrison.\n\n\nCinnibar. A fierce female warrior from the frontier planet of Babalon. Her character started in the Kayn stories, and she was also created by Morrison. She had three spin off stories involving herself and her brother Rulf who also had made his first appearance in a Kayn story. Cinnibar is a tall, statuesque, but slender woman who looks human. Her most distinctive features are the extremely long hair, and three striped marks on her face which could be tribal style tattoos. She favours combat with traditional style weapons like swords, although she is not averse to using ranged weapons like laser blasters. As Kayn once remarked, he remembered that \"Babalonians had found methods to kill practically anything that moves\". She has a cousin, Vivanna, who also became a semi-recurring character in two of the Cinnibar issues.\n\n\nGrok and Zero. One of the earlier series with a lighter tone to it. While some of the stories themselves are serious in nature, they do have a touch of humour to them. Grok is a humanoid alien, an experienced Space Policeman. His partner is injured in the first appearance and he gets assigned a new partner by the name of Smith, who he dubs 'Zero' which is derived from his service number. In this universe, Earth is not the origin of the human race, it is in fact a planet called Cappella VI, Earth having been the location of a crash of a colony ship some centuries before, from which the present population has descended, although it has regressed somewhat.\n\n\nFrank Carter. More commonly referred to as just 'Carter', he is a mandroid: part robotic, but not quite enough to be called a cyborg. His background is revealed in a later issue. Frank Carter was a perfectly normal police officer until he received a gun blast to the head. The severe head wound meant that pioneering cybernetic surgery was tried. He was given enhanced strength and reactions, but the part of his brain that contained emotions had been destroyed. His basic no-nonsense attitude to lawbreakers, and some would say overly brutal methods are constantly bringing him into conflict with his superiors. This character was created by Mike Knowles, who based him on Robocop.\n\n\nStarhawk. An intergalactic freelance troubleshooter, his real name is Sol Rynn. He answers distress calls from those in need who use a special card which slots into a computer interface. Starhawk was one of the flagship stories in the short-lived DC Thomson comic \"The Crunch\". Starhawk also made a number of brief appearances in DC Thomsons Hotspur annual. His companion is a robot simply named Droid. He has a starship that he can remotely summon. The setting is the crumbling Earth Empire which has been ravaged by years of raiding from the alien Krell. Strangely enough, little background is given to the Krell themselves and the backstory of conflict between the Krell and that of Earth is never elaborated on. The result is that much of the galaxy is in a state of lawlessness.\n\n\nSkald. The Skald series of stories initially is set in the region of a castle where the population are enslaved by powerful 'warlocks'. The warlocks use energy weapons to dispense their own brand of justice and keep the population enslaved by fear. When Skald, a young herder, finds out that he is to receive the 'collar of manhood', basically a life sentence in the mines performing hard labour, he rebels. Lashing out in anger, he kills one of the warlocks and flees the area. Later he meets with Linx, an Amazonian warrioress member of the matriarchal Yaba-Kel tribe. Many elements of the Skald stories centre around the fact that an Earth colony ship crash landed on the planet and advanced technology found its way into the hands of a select few people, and the constant struggle for this technology.\n\n\nThe Anglerre Series. This series of issues, set in the fantasy kingdom of Anglerre, follows the royal family and their conflict against various aggressors. The first appearance of Prince Veyne, in issue 200, was followed by a later issue which was a prequel showing Veyne's father, King Iagon. King Iagon had been vaguely referred to in #200, both by saying that Veyne had just ascended to the throne on the death of his father, and a ship named the 'Royal Iagon'. Much of the storyline of the Royal House of Anglerre is entwined with the god Vishena and the Demon Sword, Cerastes, who will make its user invincible, but will also kill its wielder after an unspecified period of time. The nature of Anglerre's opponents seems to make heavy use of Demons. A recurring character within this series is that of Myrdan, a seemingly immortal figure of unspecified power. In the issue \"Demon Sword\", Myrdan at one point seems to merge with Vishena, which hints that he could be an avatar of the god.\n\n\nSolo. This series charts the adventures of Solo, the sole human survivor of a cryogenic sleeper ship. The charter of his vessel, the Telurian Quest, grants him ownership of a planet. However, he finds that his planet is already inhabited as faster than light capable ships were launched some years after the Telurian ships. Solo was reared by an onboard android who educated him with tales of chivalry. Therefore, Solo has a rather archaic way of looking at things and is also naive.\n\n\nThe Robot Kid. One of the more humorous series of stories appeared in \"Starblazer\". The initial Robot Kid story was set on a frontier planet under attack from bandits. The whole story had a quasi-western feel to it. The initial story had the townsfolk try to buy a Kelso Deathmek, a war robot, to protect them. What they got was a reprogrammed cinema usher. It is computerised mind had been loaded with all sorts of clichés and popular saying from Western films. Indeed, there were homages throughout the issue with a character by the name of Angel Eyes, and another character who bore a resemblance to Lee Van Cleef in the film \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". With its body destroyed at the end of the story, the replacement body was manufactured by the Japanese arm of the company and was a parody of the many martial arts movies. The third and final appearance was a parody of the Rambo-style movies.\n\n\nCubicle 7 released a licensed tabletop role-playing game called \"Starblazer Adventures\" using the Fate system in 2008, with multiple supplements coming out through to 2013. It was shortlisted for multiple awards both at the Indie RPG Awards and the ENnies. Followup games included Legends of Anglerre, which concentrated on the fantasy elements of the later issues.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179545", "title": "Guy III of Spoleto", "text": "Guy III of Spoleto\n\nGuy III of Spoleto (, ; died 12 December 894) was the margrave of Camerino from 880 and then duke of Spoleto and Camerino from 883. He was crowned king of Italy in 889 and emperor in 891. He died in 894 while fighting for control of the Italian Peninsula.\n\nGuy was married to Ageltrude, daughter of Adelchis of Benevento, who bore him a son named Lambert.\n\nGuy was the second son of Guy I of Spoleto and Itta, daughter of Sico of Benevento. Guy I was the son of Lambert I of Nantes and his second wife, Adelaide of Lombardy, who was a daughter of Charlemagne's second eldest son, Pepin of Italy. In 842, the former Duchy of Spoleto, which had been donated to the Papacy by Charlemagne, was resurrected by the Franks to be held against Byzantine catapans to the south, as a Frankish border territory by a dependent margrave.\n\nConsequently, Guy’s family had been important players in Italian politics since the early ninth century. Although in 876 Guy and his elder brother, Lambert, Duke of Spoleto, had been commissioned by Charles the Bald to accompany Pope John VIII to Naples to break up the alliances that many of the southern Lombard states had made with the Saracens, the family’s interests were generally hostile to the papacy, a policy that Guy initially followed. \n\nWith Lambert’s death in 880, he bequeathed to Guy the march of Camerino, and in 882 Guy supported his nephew’s (Guy II of Spoleto) invasion of the Papal States. This brought him into conflict with the Emperor Charles the Fat, and in 882, at an assembly at Verona, the emperor dispossessed him of his fiefs, together with a significant number of other important, but minor, Italian nobles. Rising up in rebellion, Guy allied himself with the neighbouring Saracens and began acquiring further territory. At this point, at a diet at Ravenna, the emperor declared him guilty of high treason, and Berengar of Friuli was commanded to strip him of his fief by force. \n\nIn 883, Guy inherited his nephew's title of Spoleto and reunited the dukedom, henceforth as the \"Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino\" bearing the title of \"dux et marchio\", and by the end of 884, Emperor Charles III was forced to make peace with Guy, where he formally recovered his titles. Then in 885, he fought his occasional allies, the Saracens of the Garigliano.\n\nAfter the deposition of Charles the Fat in 887, by virtue of being a relative of Archbishop Fulk of Rheims, he had hopes of being crowned king of West Francia, and in fact travelled as far as Langres, where the bishop crowned him as such. But because of Odo's coronation that year (888), he turned and went back with designs on the crown of Italy and the emperorship.\n\nGuy of Spoleto was opposed by Berengar of Friuli for the Iron Crown of Lombardy. Although Berengar had the advantage of being allied with the Carolingian family, and of having been crowned as king of Italy in 887, from 888 Guy was closer to Rome, and had already allied himself with Pope Stephen V, who had described Guy “as his only son”. Fighting between the rival contenders began, and it was Guy who had himself proclaimed king of Italy in a diet held at Pavia at the end of the year 888. He was formally crowned King of Italy by Pope Stephen V in 889, and this was followed by his coronation as Roman Emperor on 21 February 891, together with the crowning of his son Lambert II as King of Italy.\n\nThe situation in Italy began to deteriorate with the election of a new pope, Formosus, in 891. Distrustful of Guy, he began to look elsewhere for support against the emperor, as Guy found it increasingly difficult to end the threat of Berengar who still held out in his Duchy of Friuli. To bolster his overall position, at Ravenna on 30 April 892, Guy forced Pope Formosus to crown Lambert as co-emperor. \n\nThe pope therefore took the next opportunity to oppose Guy by supporting Arnulf of Carinthia for the Italian and imperial titles. In 893, Formosus invited Arnulf to come to Trento to overthrow Guy and be crowned himself. Arnulf instead sent his son Zwentibold with an army to join Berengar, the deposed king, and march on Trento. Their joint army surrounded Trento, but Guy probably bribed them to leave him unmolested. The following year, they defeated Guy at Bergamo and took Trento and Milan. Berengar was recognised as king and a vassal of Arnulf. Zwentibold returned to Germany, as fever had wreaked havoc on the German armies. Guy retreated in order to regroup at a fortified place on the Taro and died there suddenly in late autumn, leaving his son under the tutelage of his wife. Both would contest the throne with Berengar and Arnulf.\n\nGuy's power never extended over much beyond his hereditary lands, which offered stark illustration of the fact that the imperial title, with its pretensions of universal rule, had by the end of the ninth century become merely a token of the pope's favour, to be fought over by various Italian nobles. He did not even firmly control the north of Italy, battling other claimants over the throne for much of his reign. He did try to maintain the Carolingian tradition and issue capitularies as former emperors had. In 891, he demanded the traditional service in the army of all \"arimanni\", whether they owned land or not.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179548", "title": "GWR 1000 Class", "text": "GWR 1000 Class\n\nThe Great Western Railway 1000 Class or County Class was a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotive. Thirty examples were built between 1945 and 1947, but all were withdrawn and scrapped in the early 1960s. No examples were preserved but a replica locomotive is under construction.\n\nThese locomotives were the final and most powerful development of the two-cylinder Saint Class introduced in 1901 and included several features that had already been used on the successful Modified Hall class..\n\nThe Chief Mechanical Engineer of the GWR Frederick W. Hawksworth had hoped to design a new 4-6-2 (Pacific) express locomotive for post war traffic, when he took up office in 1941 but had been prevented by the war from doing so. This scheme was not entirely dead in 1945 when he was given the authority to build another batch of mixed traffic 4-6-0s. Rather than build more examples of existing designs, Hawksworth introduced the County Class as a testbed for a number of the ideas he hoped to incorporate into the Pacific at a later date. Hawksworth was not subsequently allowed to build his Pacific, as there was no need for further express passenger locomotives.\n\nIn addition to the innovations already adopted for the Modified Hall class, the new class contained several further changes from usual Great Western practice including the use of double chimneys on certain members and a high boiler pressure of 280psi (although this was later lowered in an attempt to reduce maintenance costs). The boiler was a development that used the tooling for the LMS Stanier Class 8F boiler, Hawksworth being able to study this design closely when 8Fs were being built at Swindon as part of the war effort. The class initially had a tractive effort of , which was = greater than a Castle Class locomotive, although the tractive effort was reduced to when the boiler pressure was lowered.\nThe class had continuous splashers over the driving wheels and, when named, straight nameplates, making them immediately recognisable from other 4-6-0 classes. They were also fitted with Hawksworth’s slab-sided tenders, but the County tenders had a water tank six inches wider than the tenders built for the Modified Halls and retro-fitted to many earlier designs.\n\nSome of the early design studies for what became the County included outside Walschaerts valve gear which would have been a major break from traditional GWR designs. In the event the standard inside Stephenson link motion of the Churchward and Collett two cylinder classes was used. The GWR 1500 Class, also designed by Hawksworth, used outside Walschaerts as did the steam railcar units designed under Churchward and the narrow gauge Vale of Rheidol 2-6-2T.\n\nThe first batch of twenty were built at Swindon Works and delivered between August 1945 and March 1946 (Lot No. 354). They were originally unnamed and were planned to be numbered in the 9900 series, but this was changed to 1000-1019 before introduction. A second batch of ten further locomotives (1020-1029) were built between April 1946 and April 1947 (Swindon Lot 358). The second batch were given names English and Welsh Counties previously used on the GWR 3800 Class of 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were part of George Jackson Churchward's locomotive standardisation programme in the early days of the 20th century.\n\nThe Counties had a mixed reception: some traditionalists regarded them as ‘non-standard, expensive and unnecessary,’ others considered them a successful, free steaming design, well suited to express or freight work and a fitting finale to GW two-cylinder 4-6-0 development. According to O.S. Nock ‘their best and really brilliant work was done north of Wolverhampton where they ran very heavy trains with conspicuous success.’\nAfter the nationalisation of Britain's railways in 1948 all 30 Counties continued to do useful work throughout the Western Region of British Railways, working with Castles on expresses to and from Paddington as well as more menial freight and parcels tasks. BR gave the Counties the power classification 6MT. Speedometers were fitted to the class from 1950 and modified double from 1956.\n\nWithdrawals of the class took place between September 1962 and November 1964 and all were scrapped.\n\nHowever a replica is being built at the Didcot Railway Centre, home of the Great Western Society. When completed it will take the name and number of No. 1014 \"County of Glamorgan\" in recognition of the late Dai Woodham's Barry Scrapyard in Glamorganshire from which many withdrawn steam locomotives were saved for preservation. Also Glamorganshire County Council donated the frames and boiler for the project. \nThe replica is based around the frames from Modified Hall Class 7927 \"Willington Hall\" and the boiler from LMS Stanier 8F 48518. The boiler from the Hall will be used in the replica Grange project at the Llangollen Railway. It will also have a number of smaller original parts off scrapped County locomotives including the chimney from 1006 \"County of Cornwall\".\n\nHornby Railways manufacture a model of the 10xx in OO gauge.\n"}

These are collectively known as Shan States.\nThree ranks of chiefs were recognized by the King of Burma and later by the British administration. These ranks were:\n\nThe distinction in the titles dates from the days of the Burmese monarchy although the same states have not continued to hold the same titles for their chiefs during the centuries -- changes took place according to royal favour, results of battles and later, the decisions of the British authorities. The privileges and titles were so much a matter of royal ordinance that every one of a Sawbwa's symbols of power was laid down in a special book of dispensations granted by the higher court. His regalia and clothes, the guilding and jewel decoration of betel boxes, spittoons, fly-whisks and such articles of use, the dress of ministers, the umbrellas, spears and horses in procession, the caparisoning of the royal elephant, the instruments for processional music, the gateways and the style of residence, all were rigidly prescribed to ensure that the dignity kept up accordance with the status of a royal chieftain, yet did not encroach on the special privileges reserved for the court of Ava itself. The British, whose success in administration was largely bound up with observance, of precedence in a hierarchy, listed states also as Sawbaships, Myosaships and Ngwegunhmuships.\n\nThe following lists the Sawbwas in order of the precedence, at the time of the British annexation of the Shan States.\n\nLast Sawbwa – Sao Hkun Aung\n\nRulers (title Ngwegunhmu)\n\n\nRulers (title Myoza)\n\n\n\nFounded before 1700 and under a Myosa, its known rulers were:\nLast – Sao Htun Aye aka.

{"id": "2179593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179593", "title": "Geography of Korea", "text": "Geography of Korea\n\nKorea is located on the Korean Peninsula in Northeast Asia. To the northwest, the Amnok River (Yalu River) separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River (Tumen River) separates Korea from China and Russia. The Yellow Sea is to the west, the East China Sea and Korea Strait is to the south, and the Sea of Japan (East Sea) is to the east. Notable islands include Jeju Island (Jejudo), Ulleung Island (Ulleungdo), and Liancourt Rocks.\n\nThe southern and western parts of the peninsula have well-developed plains, while the eastern and northern parts are mountainous. The highest mountain in Korea is Mount Paektu or Paektusan (), through which runs the border with China. The southern extension of Mount Paektu is a highland called Gaema Heights. This highland was mainly raised during the Cenozoic orogeny and partly covered by volcanic matter. To the south of Gaema Gowon, successive high mountains are located along the eastern coast of the peninsula. This mountain range is named Baekdudaegan. Some significant mountains include Mount Sobaek or Sobaeksan (), Mount Kumgang or Kumgangsan (), Mount Seorak or Seoraksan (), Mount Taebaek or Taebaeksan (), and Mount Jiri or Jirisan (). There are several lower, secondary mountain ranges whose direction is almost perpendicular to that of Baekdudaegan. They are developed along the tectonic line of Mesozoic orogeny and their directions are basically northwest.\n\nUnlike most ancient mountains on the mainland, many important islands in Korea were formed by volcanic activity in the Cenozoic orogeny. Jeju Island, situated off the southern coast, is a large volcanic island whose main mountain Mount Halla or Hallasan () is the highest in South Korea. Ulleung Island is a volcanic island in the Sea of Japan, whose composition is more felsic than Jeju-do. The volcanic islands tend to be younger, the more westward.\n\nBecause the mountainous region is mostly on the eastern part of the peninsula, the main rivers tend to flow westwards. Two exceptions are the southward-flowing Nakdong River (Nakdonggang) and Seomjin River (Seomjingang). Important rivers running westward include the Amnok River, the Chongchon River (Chongchongang), the Taedong River (Taedonggang), the Han River (Hangang), the Geum River (Geumgang), and the Yeongsan River (Yeongsangang). These rivers have vast flood plains and provide an ideal environment for wet-rice cultivation.\n\nThe southern and southwestern coastlines of Korea form a well-developed ria coastline, known as \"Dadohae-jin\" in Korean. Its convoluted coastline provides mild seas, and the resulting calm environment allows for safe navigation, fishing, and seaweed farming. In addition to the complex coastline, the western coast of the Korean Peninsula has an extremely high tidal amplitude (at Incheon, around the middle of the western coast. It can get as high as ). Vast tidal flats have been developing on the south and west coastlines.\n\nMountains cover 70 percent of Korea and arable plains are generally small and fall between the successive mountain ranges. The peninsula becomes more mountainous towards the north and the east, with the highest mountains (including Baekdu Mountain which stands at ) found in the north.\n\nThe peninsula has of coastline, and the south and west coasts are particularly irregular. Most of the 3,579 islands off the peninsula are found along the south and the west coasts.\n\nThe climate of Korea differs dramatically from north to south. The southern regions experience a relatively warm and wet climate similar to that of Japan, affected by warm ocean waters including the East Korea Warm Current. The northern regions experience a colder and to some extent more inland climate, in common with Manchuria. For example, the annual precipitation of the Yalu River valley () is less than half of that on the south coast (). Likewise, there is a difference in January temperature between the peninsula's southern and northern tips.\n\nThe entire peninsula, however, is affected by similar climactic patterns, including the East Asian monsoon in midsummer and frequent typhoons in autumn. The majority of rainfall takes place during the summer months, with nearly half during the monsoon alone. Winters are cold, with January temperatures typically below freezing outside of Jeju Island. Winter precipitation is minimal, with little snow accumulation outside of mountainous areas.\n\nSurveys of Korean flora have identified more than 3,000 species on the peninsula, of which more than 500 are endemic. The peninsula's floristic provinces are commonly divided between warm-temperate, temperate, and cold-temperate zones. The warm-temperate zone prevails over the southern coast and islands, including Jeju-do. It is largely typified by broad-leaved evergreens.\n\nThe temperate zone covers the great majority of the peninsula, away from the southern coast and high mountains. It is dominated by the Korean pine and various broad-leaved deciduous trees. Cold-temperate vegetation is found along the peninsula's northern fringe and in the high mountains, including the upper reaches of Hallasan on Jeju. Evergreens in this area include larch and juniper. Much of this vegetation is shared with Manchuria.\n\nAccording to the World Wide Fund for Nature, Korea consists of several ecoregions. The Southern Korea evergreen forests occupy the southernmost portion of the peninsula, as well as the island of Jeju. The Central Korea deciduous forests occupy the more temperate central portion of the peninsula. Manchurian mixed forests occupy the northern lowlands and low hills of the peninsula, and extend north into Manchuria as far as the Amur River on the Russia-China border. The Changbai Mountains mixed forests include the higher elevation mountain region along the North Korea-China border, where forests are dominated by conifers, with alpine meadows and rock slopes on the highest peaks.\n\nThe terrain of Korea is rumpled, covered with low mountains. Most rocks are of Precambrian origin, although isolated pockets of Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic rock can also be found.\n\nThere are no active volcanoes on the peninsula. However, Baekdu Mountain in the north and Hallasan in the south have crater lakes, indicating that they were active not long ago. Furthermore, hot springs indicative of low-level volcanic activity are widespread throughout the peninsula. Roughly two earthquakes are recorded per year, but few have any major impact.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179597", "title": "London Stadium", "text": "London Stadium\n\nLondon Stadium (formerly and also known as Olympic Stadium and The Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park) is a multi-purpose outdoor stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in the Stratford district of London. It was constructed for the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics—serving as the track and field venue, and as the site of their opening and closing ceremonies. Following the Games, the stadium was subsequently renovated as a multi-purpose stadium and now serves primarily as the home of West Ham United of the Premier League.\n\nLand preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008. The stadium held its first public event in March 2012, serving as the finish line for a celebrity run organised by the National Lottery. Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics, the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with 66,000 seats, but with capacity for football limited to 60,000 under the terms of the lease. The decision to make West Ham United the main tenants was controversial, with the initial tenancy process having to be rerun.\n\nThe stadium hosted several 2015 Rugby World Cup matches, two England rugby league Test matches, and the 2017 IAAF World Championships and 2017 World Para Athletics Championships (the first time both events had been held in the same location in the same year). The stadium can also hold concerts with up to 80,000 spectators, and, due to its oval shape and relocatable seating, was deemed to have the potential to host for other sports such as baseball and cricket. In June 2019 the stadium hosted the first regular season US Major League Baseball game in Europe, in which the Boston Red Sox played a two-game series against the New York Yankees.\n\nDuring London's bid for the games, promotional materials featured a main stadium with a roof \"designed to wrap itself around the venue like muscles supporting the body\", however at that time there had been no formal design brief agreed. While the bidding process was ongoing West Ham had talks with the ODA about contributing to the development of a multi-purpose stadium, should London win the bid. The government preferred to produce a brief for an athletics only stadium which would be largely disassembled after the games with the lower tier remaining in place as a permanent athletics facility to replace the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. With the original Olympic design finalised and being built, the government had a change of heart and a bidding process for a multi-sport post-Olympic legacy was launched.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games confirmed that it had selected Sir Robert McAlpine and Populous to start exclusive negotiations with, to fulfil the eventual design and build contract of the new Olympic Stadium after no other organisations met the bidding criteria. The stadium design was launched on 7 November 2007.\n\nThe construction of the stadium commenced three months early in May 2008 after the bowl of the stadium had been dug out and the area cleared. The building of the stadium was completed in March 2011 reportedly on time and under budget, with the athletics track laid in October 2011.\nThe stadium's track and field arena is excavated out of the soft clay found on the site, around which is permanent seating for 25,000, built using concrete \"rakers\". The natural slope of the land is incorporated into the design, with warm-up and changing areas dug into a semi-basement position at the lower end. Spectators enter the stadium via a podium level, which is level with the top of the permanent seating bowl. A demountable lightweight steel and pre-cast concrete upper tier was built up from this \"bowl\" to accommodate a further 55,000 spectators.\nThe stadium is made up of different tiers; during the Games the stadium was able to hold 80,000 spectators. The base tier, which allows for 25,000 seats, is a sunken elliptical bowl that is made up of low-carbon-dioxide concrete; this contains 40 percent less embodied carbon than conventional concrete. The foundation of the base level is 5,000 piles reaching up to deep. From there, there is a mixture of driven cast \"in situ\" piles, continuous flight auger piles, and vibro concrete columns. The second tier, which holds 55,000 seats, is long, wide, and high. The stadium contains just under a quarter of the steel as the Olympic Stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Summer Olympics, approximately . In addition to the minimal use of steel, which makes it 75 percent lighter, the stadium also uses high-yield large diameter pipes which were surplus on completion of North Sea gas pipeline projects in its compression truss, recycled granite, and many of the building products were transported using trains and barges rather than by lorry.\nA wrap, funded by Dow Chemical Company in return for being able to advertise on the wrap until 26 June 2012, covered the exterior during the Olympics. The wrap was made from polyester and polyethylene, and printed using UV curable inks. The wrap was made of pieces of material that covered high and in length. The final design for the wrap consisted of fabric panels, twisted at 90-degree angles to allow entry to the stadium at the bottom of the structure, and held in place with tensioned cables.\n\nTo allow for fast on-site assembly, compression truss and roof column connections were bolted; this enabled easy disassembling of the roof structure after the closing ceremonies. The cable-supported roof structure covers approximately two-thirds of the stadium's seating. Reaching above the field of play, the stadium roof held 14 lighting towers, or paddles, that collectively contained a total of 532 individual 2 kW floodlight lamps. The lights were first officially switched on in December 2010 by Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson. During the games, the towers were fitted with additional ceremony lighting, and 4 of the 14 towers held large temporary video screens.\n\nThe stadium was equipped with a nine lane Mondo athletics track. The turf in the stadium was grown in Scunthorpe and was a mix of perennial ryegrass, smooth stalk meadow grass and fescue grass seeds. It took 360 rolls of grass to cover the infield and was laid in March 2011. The track was designed by Italian company Mondo, and was their latest version of the Mondotrack FTX.\n\nThe stadium's 80,000 seats had a black and white 'fragment' theme that matched the overall branding design used by LOCOG for London 2012. The lines all centred on the finish line in the stadium. The seats were made in Luton and were fitted between May and December 2010. During the Games, the Stadium's grandstands contained a lighting system developed by Tait Technologies that allowed them to function as a giant video screen. Individual \"paddles\" containing nine LED pixels each were installed between each seat of the stadium, which were controlled via a central system to display video content wrapped around the stadium. The system was primarily intended for use during the ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nThe red Mondo 400-metre athletics track used for the London 2012 games was laid in August 2011, possessed nine lanes, and was thick. It used two vulcanised rubber layers, one of which was a cushioning underside with elongated diamond-shaped cells, which allowed them to flex in any direction. During the four London 2012 ceremonies, the track was protected via synthetic covering. For the stadium's transformation, the track was protected from construction work for the 2015 events by covering it with a plastic sheet layer and burying it under of soil. The Mondotrack surface was removed in early 2016 and a new surface, using 17,000 sqm of the improved Mondotrack/WS, was laid that May. Some of the original running track from (mainly) the home straight was kept so that it could be sold and auctioned to the public, thereby raising money to reinvest into operating the stadium and its neighbouring community track. The grass playing field was lengthened by several metres at either end for the 2015 rugby matches to fit a suitably-sized rugby/football pitch, and was reseeded with a Desso GrassMaster artificial-natural hybrid pitch approved for Premier league matches of , ready for West Ham United, complete with undersoil heating. In football/pitch mode, the pitch is surrounded by artificial turf and carpeting that covers the exposed sections of the running track.\n\nInitially, the stadium design received a mixed response from the media, with reviews ranging from \"magnificent\" to the derisory \"bowl of blancmange\". The design was promoted as example of \"sustainable development\", but some architecture critics have questioned both its aesthetic value and suitability as a national icon – especially when compared with Beijing National Stadium. For example, Ellis Woodman, \"Building Design\"s architecture critic, said of the design: \"The principle of it being dismountable is most welcome... it demonstrates an obvious interest in establishing an economy of means and as such is the antithesis of the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing. But while that's an achievement, it's not an architectural achievement. In design terms what we're looking at is pretty underwhelming.\" He went on to criticise the procurement and design processes – stating of the latter that it should have been subject to an architectural competition. This view was echoed by Tom Dyckhoff, \"The Times\"'s architecture critic, who described the design as \"tragically underwhelming\" and commented that the \"architecture of the 2008 and 2012 Olympics will, in years to come, be seen by historians as a \"cunning indicator of the decline of the West and the rise of the East\".\nDespite the criticism the Olympic Stadium was nominated for the 2012 Stirling Prize in architecture losing out to the Sainsbury Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAmanda Baillieu writing in \"Building Design\" challenged the designer's claims that the stadium is environmentally sustainable and good value for money. Instead, it is asserted that the reality will be the opposite. In particular, she claimed that:\n\nThe stadium site is on former industrial land between the River Lea (which rejoins the Navigation below Old Ford Lock), the City Mill River, and the Old Pudding Mill River; parts of the Bow Back Rivers. Another branch of this system, St Thomas' Creek, to the south, completes an \"island\" surrounded by water. to the east is the Waterworks River; with the London Aquatics Centre on its eastern bank. This \"island\" site for the stadium lies at the southern end of the Olympic Park. To make room for the stadium, the already partially obstructed Pudding Mill River, a short channel of the Lea which ran from the west side of the stadium south-eastwards across the stadium site, was filled in.\n\nDennis Hone, chief executive of the LLDC, revealed in November 2012 that the stadium would not meet its reopening deadline of 2014. Instead the stadium would reopen in August 2015 with the stadium retaining a capacity of around 50,000 for athletics. Following the granting, in March 2013, of a 99-year tenancy to West Ham United, the \"E20 LLP\", a joint organisation by the London Legacy Development Corporation and Newham Council were specifically set-up to oversee redevelopment of the stadium into a UEFA Category 4 venue seating 66,000 spectators. The reconfiguration saw work on a new roof, corporate areas, toilets, concessions and retractable seating. West Ham contributed £15 million and Newham Council £40 million for the work to be carried out with the LLDC and the British Government making up the rest. Approval was granted for the installation of retractable seating on all sides of the stadium and an transparent roof.\n\nBalfour Beatty were initially contracted to construct the new roof for £41 million; in January 2014 they were awarded a £154 million tender, which includes the earlier contract for the roof, to complete the stadium's transformation works. Imtech G&H were awarded a £25 million contract to carry out electrical and plumbing work. Paul Kelso, working for Sky News, discovered in September 2014 that the cost of the conversion of the stadium may rise by £15 million, due to additional work to strengthen the structure, to allow it to support the new roof. It was revealed neither West Ham United nor the taxpayer would have to meet the additional cost as Balfour Beatty would contribute with the remainder funded from the existing LLDC transformation budget of the Olympic Park. In October 2014, the LLDC contributed a further £35.9 million towards the project with the funding coming from reserves and income generated by other means.\n\nWork commenced on 13 August 2013 with the removal of 25,000 seats and the grass from the field of play. The athletics track was covered with a layer of recycled concrete to protect it during the heavy lifting. In November 2013 work commenced to remove the fourteen floodlight panels as part of the £200 million conversion of the stadium. In March 2015 work began on installing the new floodlights. Each floodlight panel is tall and weighs , and will sit above the stadium's floor, suspended from the roof rather than sitting on top; in total there are 14 panels. As the floodlight work began, work on a steel halo structure that encircles the stadium, containing 96 turnstiles, catering and toilet facilities, concluded.\nThe black and white seating design from the Olympics, was replaced with a white, blue and claret design. The new design includes West Ham's name on the East Kop Stand and symbolic crossed hammers on all lower tier stands, and the retention of the 2012 shard design on the upper tier, albeit in new colouring to match the Stadium's anchor tenant. Work continued through 2016 to transform the stadium into a home for West Ham, with the club's colours and giant model West Ham shirts added to the stadium concourse. A West Ham store and coffee shop was opened on 23 June. In February 2019, it was announced that the East Stand would be renamed in honour of Billy Bonds. In an attempt to make the London Stadium more like their home ground, in April 2019 a £250,000 claret-coloured pitch surround was announced and installed. In February 2020, West Ham announced planned alterations to the stadium introducing two new lower tier stands moving supporters closer to the pitch, many by more than four metres. In March 2020, West Ham, opened a Sensory room at the stadium for fans.\n\nFollowing the demolition of the 2012 warm up track and to comply with IAAF rules requiring a warm up track at Construction Category 1 facilities, a new 6 lane community track (8 lanes on the straights) has been created immediately adjacent to the south of the stadium. The track is home to Newham and Essex Beagles Athletic Club from 2017 and opened for around 250 days of the year. The construction of the track was funded by a grant from the London Marathon Trust.\n\n The Olympic Stadium hosted its first public event on 31 March 2012, serving as the finish line for the \"National Lottery Olympic Park Run\". Five thousand participants (including celebrities, British athletes and members of the public who won a draw organised by the National Lottery) took part in a five-mile run around Olympic Park, entering Olympic Stadium to the theme from \"Chariots of Fire\" to run the final 300 metres on its track. The stadium hosted two warm-up events for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games as part of the London Prepares series. The venue hosted the British Universities Athletics Championships and the London Disability Grand Prix in May 2012. On 6 May around 40,000 people attended an event entitled \"2,012 hours to go: an evening of athletics and entertainment\". The evening was hosted by Gabby Logan and Vernon Kay, and Jon Culshaw, Mel C, Hugh Bonneville, Chipmunk and Jack Whitehall appeared. Niamh Clarke-Willis, a nine-year-old, was chosen to open the stadium ceremonially. During the London Disability Grand Prix, Paul Blake (T36, 1500 metres), Hannah Cockroft (T34, 100 metres), Michael McKillop (T37, 1500 metres) and Richard Whitehead (T42, 200 metres) all set new world records. The stadium also hosted the athletics events of the British school games.\n\nThe stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2012 Olympic Games. During the Athletics events of the Olympic Games David Rudisha broke his own world record for the 800 metres to become the first man to run the distance in under 1 minute 41 seconds. In the 4 × 100 metres relay the team from Jamaica also broke their own world record from the 2011 World Championships by two-tenths of a second. The United States women's 4 by 100 metres team beat the previous best set by East Germany in 1985, recording a time of 40.82 seconds to set a new world record. Olympic records were set by Usain Bolt, who ran the second fastest 100 metres, Renaud Lavillenie in the Pole vault by 1 cm, Sally Pearson recorded a record time in the 100 metres hurdles and Tatyana Lysenko set a new mark in the Hammer.\n\nThe stadium also hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Paralympic Games.

Multiple records were set in the field by Dong Xia, Birgit Kober, Na Mi, Yang Liwan, and Wang Zhiming.\n\nThe decision on how to use the stadium after the Olympics went through two rounds of bidding: the first was rejected on 11 October 2011, after concerns had emerged about European Union competition law and particularly the risk of illegal state aid.\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) set five criteria: that the new tenant should produce a viable long-term solution that provided value for money, secured a partner with the expertise to operate a legacy solution, reopened the stadium as quickly as possible, made the stadium a distinctive physical symbol that supported regeneration, and allowed flexible usage. After receiving and pre-screening over 100 expressions of interest, the formal bidding process of selecting the post-Olympics user of the stadium opened on 18 August 2010. It ran until 30 September, after which the OPLC drew up a shortlist, with a view to selecting a tenant by the end of the financial year (31 March 2011).\n\nOn 12 November 2010, it was announced that two bids had been shortlisted for the stadium post-Olympics. They were a joint bid from Tottenham Hotspur and Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), and a second bid from West Ham United and Newham Council.\n\nThe legacy plan for the stadium had involved converting it into a 25,000- to 30,000-seat athletics stadium with a sports training, science and medicine centre after the 2012 Paralympics. Media reports, however, suggested that several potential tenants were interested in moving to the stadium after the games. Media speculation and expressions of interest which did not result in bids included: the England and Wales Cricket Board and Kent County Cricket Club; Middlesex County Cricket Club, Essex County Cricket Club: Wasps RFC; Saracens R.F.C.; London Skolars R.L.F.C.; Major League Baseball; the National Football League, which had been looking at the potential of a franchise in London; and Leyton Orient F.C..\n\nThese joint bidders had each separately expressed interest in the venue, but submitted a joint bid. AEG is the company that redeveloped the loss-making Millennium Dome exhibition venue in South East London into the profitable music venue The O. On 26 July 2010, it was rumoured that Tottenham might be interested in taking over the stadium after the Games. The club had plans to build a new stadium adjacent to their then current stadium as part of the Northumberland Development Project (which eventually came to fruition in 2019), but the planning application and the funding for that development were proving difficult for the club, making the Olympic Stadium a viable option.\n\nAfter the acquisition of West Ham United in 2010 by David Gold and David Sullivan, the new owners expressed their desire to make the stadium the club's new home. With Mayor Boris Johnson expressing his desire for a football club to take over the stadium after the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, this seemed the most likely option. At the opening of the formal bid process, West Ham United were considered favourites once they withdrew their initial opposition to keeping the running track in place, as well as planning a £100 million conversion to create a 66,000 capacity venue, which would also host international football, international athletics, as well as Essex County Cricket Club, international Twenty20 cricket matches, NFL games, and Live Nation events.\n\nOn 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) unanimously selected West Ham United and Newham Council as the preferred bidders to take over the stadium after the 2012 Games. But Leyton Orient, a lower league team who are geographically the nearest professional football club to the London Stadium, complained that as the stadium was so close to their own ground, West Ham's occupancy of it would breach F.A. rules and could even force them into bankruptcy. On 3 March 2011, West Ham United's proposed move to the stadium was approved by the British Government and London Mayor Boris Johnson.\n\nTottenham Hotspur F.C. and Leyton Orient F.C. applied for a judicial review to overturn the Olympic Park Legacy Company's (OPLC) decision; however, this appeal was rejected in June 2011. Tottenham Hotspur appealed the decision not to have a review on 29 June 2011. The OPLC announced on 5 July 2011 that an independent review into the awarding of the Olympic Park Stadium to West Ham United was to be carried out following the discovery on 30 June 2011 that an employee, Dionne Knight had been engaged by West Ham United to carry out consultancy work relating to the stadium without permission of the OPLC. Knight had already declared to the OPLC that she was in a personal relationship with a director of West Ham United, and was suspended whilst a possible conflict of interest was investigated. On 22 August 2011, the independent investigation ruled that the process was not compromised and thus the bid process will not be reopened. On 23 August, the day before Tottenham Hotspur were due in court, they staged \"intense negotiations\" with the office of the Mayor of London, and looked set to drop all claims for a review and be offered funding for their own stadium. However, the next day Tottenham did attend court despite being close to striking a deal about their own stadium. Tottenham and Leyton Orient won a review of the decision, being told that they had an arguable case. The review was scheduled to take place on 18 October 2011. Even if Tottenham abandoned the review, due to being granted a new stadium as part of their Northumberland Development Project, Orient were expected to continue, with its owner Barry Hearn calling the decision to grant a review \"a great day for the little man\". However, the bid was later cancelled before the review was completed, due to a series of concerns regarding EU laws.\n\nOnce the original deal collapsed a new process to select a tenant was begun. The athletics legacy clause was clarified to ensure that a track remained in the stadium. West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium. On 17 October 2011, a day before they were due in court for the judicial review to start into the original bidding process, Tottenham Hotspur ended their legal challenge about the original decision to award the stadium to West Ham United. This marked Spurs' end to their interest in the stadium. On 18 October, Leyton Orient submitted an application to the English Football League for permission for a move to the stadium. Chairman Barry Hearn said, \"We are asking for a 25,000-seater stadium and we want to see if we can get around the athletics track. It has to stay, we know that. But can we build up, if not down, and see if it's possible to get it covered while we play?\".\n\nIn February 2012, 16 parties were interested in the stadium. In July 2012, four bidders were announced:\n\nIn April 2012, the Olympic Park Legacy Company was dismantled and responsibilities transferred to the newly constituted London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC). Daniel Moylan, chairman of the LLDC, was removed by Mayor Boris Johnson on 12 September 2012, after having made changes to the leadership of the organisation that annoyed some Board members. Johnson took on the chairmanship of the corporation himself.\n\nIn December 2012, West Ham were named as the preferred bidder for the stadium with a separate operator co-ordinating community and sporting use, as well as concerts and events. Leyton Orient's bid was rejected due to its commercial viability and the bid from Intelligent Transport Services, in conjunction with Formula One, was rejected for having too much speculation and uncertainty in their business plan. However, with so much public money going into the stadium and its redevelopment, the BBC learned that David Gold and David Sullivan must share any profits they make if they sell the club. West Ham were given three months to improve the terms of their deal or lose the stadium; with Johnson going with plan B without football. The two parties seemed to find common ground in February 2013, with West Ham, reportedly, agreeing to paying £2.5 million in rent per year. They additionally promised to pay back any extra cost for the roof and seats within ten years. Gold stated at the beginning of March that a deal could be complete by the middle of the month. On 22 March 2013, West Ham United secured a 99-year lease deal, with the stadium planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016–2017 season. In July 2013, UK Athletics received a 50-year deal for the use of the stadium. UK Athletics will have access to the stadium every year from the last Friday in June until the end of July.\n\nOn 6 March, Barry Hearn of Leyton Orient stated that he would mount another legal challenge as he believed the rules set out by the LLDC had not been followed. Hearn also said he felt Leyton Orient's proposed ground share had been ignored and not properly explored. In April 2013, he was informed that his call for a judicial review had been rejected. An oral application was submitted in June 2013. On 19 September 2013, Leyton Orient lost their bid to win a judicial review into the decision to grant West Ham the tenancy of the Olympic Stadium. At the High Court, Mr Justice Lewis said the LLDC was entitled to make the decision which was not \"irrational\". In November 2013 it was the House of Lords' opinion that Leyton Orient should be allowed occasional use of the stadium, with Lord Harris telling Orient and West Ham to \"stop squabbling like children.\" Dennis Hone stated that he was in talks with Barry Hearn over occasional usage, but that it would not mean a permanent groundshare. In early December, the LLDC said that there was nothing to stop Orient from negotiating a rental agreement with whichever firm ends up running the stadium. Orient, however, would not be able to negotiate a 99-year deal like West Ham and would only have usage of the stadium when the Hammers are not playing. On 1 July 2014, Leyton Orient brought an end to their dispute with the Premier League regarding the future use of the stadium, after a confidential agreement between the two parties was reached.\n\nSupporters of various rival clubs pressed for an inquiry into the LLDC's granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement. However, in September 2015 the government rejected holding such an inquiry. In October 2015, the LLDC released a 207-page document with redacted sections. West Ham's annual rent was not revealed as this was seen to be commercially sensitive information. On 14 April 2016 it was revealed that West Ham will pay £2.5 million per year during a 99-year lease of the stadium but will not have to fund police, stewarding, heating, pitch maintenance, or corner flags. Barry Hearn described the deal as one his dog could have bettered.\n\nIn September 2018, Lyn Garner, chief executive of the London Lecacy Development Corporation, revealed that the £2.5m paid per year by West Ham did not even cover the cost of staging matches leading to increased debts in running the stadium for the 97-year remainder of their tenancy agreement. The LLDC had established a commercial subsidiary, E20, as landlords for the Stadium; and E20 - through their appointment of a stadium operator - provide for all matchday stewarding, catering, cleaning, fabric and maintenance services - albeit that they profited through the bulk of franchise fees from catering concessions and bars. E20 and West Ham became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute in the High Court as to which elements of service were included in the annual payments under the 99-year lease, and which elements might be expected to involve an additional regular facility fee (with particular reference to West Ham wishing to replace the covering to the athletics track with one in club colours); and E20 refused to open discussions on allowing the usable capacity of the stadium to increase to its full potential of seats unless these disputes were resolved to their satisfaction. However, in November 2018, both parties agreed to an out-of-court settlement, under which the annual lease payment would be uplifted as the usable capacity increased towards 66,000.\n\nIn October 2014 \"The Evening Standard\" reported that French company Vinci SA were favourites to be given a contract to run the stadium for ten years. The company which already operates several other stadiums, including the Stade de France in Paris, had reportedly beaten off competition from other companies including Anschutz Entertainment Group who run The O. In February 2015, Vinci Stadium, a subsidiary of Vinci Concessions, were appointed to manage the stadium starting in April 2015 for a 25-year period. The company will also be responsible for the London Marathon Charitable Trust Community Track and events on the south park lawn. This is the first stadium outside France to be managed by Vinci. Vinci set up a subsidiary company called London Stadium 185 (LS185), with the 185 signifying how many medals were won by British athletes at the London Olympic and Paralympic Games. In January 2019 the London Legacy Development Corporation brought LS185 from Vinci and kept all the existing staff in place; after concerns were raised in regards to costs at the venue as it turned in a £3.5 million loss the previous year.\n\nAlthough West Ham United are the primary tenants, the stadium operators arrange many other events for the stadium.\n\nOn 24 January 2013, it was confirmed that the London Athletics Grand Prix, a Diamond League event, would be switched to the stadium. In February 2013, it was announced that after the stadium would also hold a Paralympic athletics event on 28 July. In April Sainsbury's were announced as sponsors and the event was renamed the \"Anniversary Games\". At the event David Weir set a world record for the T54 mile.\n\nThe London Grand Prix was scheduled to move permanently to the stadium in 2016. However, due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup taking place in the stadium, using the original seating configuration, the opportunity came to move the Grand Prix to the stadium a year early, again under the name of the Anniversary Games. During the 2015 events national records were set by Dafne Schippers (100 m), Dina Asher-Smith (100 m), Shara Proctor(long jump), while Georgina Hermitage (400 m T37) and Sophie Hahn (100 m T38) set world records.\n\nThe Muller Anniversary Games, the fourth anniversary event, took place in the stadium on 22–23 July 2016. The IPC Grand Prix events were incorporated alongside Diamond League events on the second day of the meet. At the event Kendra Harrison broke the women's 100m hurdles world record, a time which has existed for 28 years.\n\nThe 2017 Muller Anniversary Games was shortened to a one-day event on Sunday 9 July 2017. Its move to an earlier time of the month was due to the 2017 World Athletics Championships\n\nThe 2018 edition returned to a two-day event on its typical weekend of 21–22 July. Tom Bosworth set a world record in the 3000 metres walk event. Kare Adenegan and Sophie Hahn set world record times in the T34 100m and T38 200m events. While Sifan Hassan set a Diamond League Record in the women's mile.\n\nLondon had bid to host the 2015 World Athletics Championships using the Olympic Stadium. It went up against Beijing's Olympic Stadium and the Polish city of Chorzów. However, the stadium had to withdraw their bid due to uncertainties arising out of the timing of the announcement of who would operate the stadium after the Olympics, thus gifting Beijing the championships. With issues resolved over the stadium's future, London again used the stadium to bid for the 2017 World Athletics Championships. The bid was made official in August with Lord Coe personally submitting the bid a few weeks later at the 2011 World Athletic Championships in Daegu which was supported by London's Mayor Boris Johnson and the British Government. On 11 November 2011, the IAAF officially awarded the 2017 World Championships to London. The World Para Athletics Championships (formerly the IPC Athletics World Championships) were planned to take place a month before the able-bodied event and were formally confirmed for the stadium in December 2012. The 2017 able-bodied athletics event was the final track championship for Mo Farah and Usain Bolt.\n\nThe World Para Athletics Championships were held between 14–23 July 2017, with 800,000 tickets available across 16 sessions. The IAAF World Championships followed between 4–13 August 2017 with 700,000 tickets available. 3,300 athletes from 200 countries competed for 690 medals across 245 events.\n\nIn February 2018, London Stadium was announced as the venue for the inaugural Athletics World Cup. The event was held on 14 and 15 July.\n\nWest Ham United play at this stadium, having moved from their former Boleyn Ground in August 2016. West Ham sold out the 50,000 season ticket allocation for the stadium by May 2016 for the 2016–17 season.\n\nThe opening game for West Ham was a Europa League match against NK Domžale on 4 August 2016, which West Ham won 3–0 with the stadium sold out, albeit with a reduced capacity of 54,000 as conversion works were still being finished. The official opening match was a friendly with Juventus on 7 August with a 2–3 defeat. West Ham's first Premier League match at the stadium was against Bournemouth with an attendance of 56,977. Watford were the first Premier League side to beat West Ham at the London Stadium, overcoming a two-goal deficit to beat West Ham 4–2.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2016–17 season, West Ham's games were marred by instances of crowd trouble. Against Bournemouth on 21 August some fans arrived with tickets for seats that did not exist. Fighting also occurred between rival supporters outside the stadium. On 26 August during a Europa League game against FC Astra Giurgiu fighting broke out in the stadium with a supporter being arrested on suspicion of causing ABH. Against Watford, rival fans fought following poor crowd segregation. On 1 October 2016, against Middlesbrough three people were arrested as violent clashes occurred. On 22 October 2016, against Sunderland rival fans confronted each other as Sunderland fans returned to transport taking them home. By 25 October 2016, 23 banning orders had been issued to fans with nine arrests. There was further crowd trouble on 26 October 2016 during West Ham's EFL Cup fourth-round game against London rivals, Chelsea. Seven people were arrested as police introduced a ban on the sale of alcohol. Plastic bottles, seats and coins were thrown during West Ham's 2–1 victory. Hundreds of supporters clashed and riot police entered the concourse. West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said any supporter identified as having taken part in the violence would receive a lifetime ban. MP Mark Field called for West Ham to play behind closed doors should any further violence occur. In October 2016, football stadium design expert, Paul Fletcher said that the stadium should be pulled down and rebuilt as in its current design it was not right for football fans as they were too far from the pitch. In December 2016, a cameraman working for Arsenal TV was punched in the face by a West Ham supporter towards the end of West Ham's 1–5 defeat by Arsenal.\n\nIn March 2018, there were protests against West Ham United owner, David Sullivan at the stadium during a 3–0 home defeat to Burnley. There were four pitch invasions and Sullivan was escorted from his seat before the end of the match. Sullivan was also hit on the head by a coin thrown by one of the supporters. Karren Brady called the events \"one of the most painful days\" in the club's history. Following the crowd trouble, West Ham banned five supporters for life for invading the pitch. Several people who had thrown coins and other objects were also given lifetime bans. Calling the scenes at the stadium a \"disgrace\", London mayor, Sadiq Khan said that the crowd trouble had been organised and co-ordinated. Investigation had revealed that over a dozen fights had broken out in the ground between West Ham supporters and that 26 people had attempted to invade the pitch with twenty-two being stopped by stewards. There were 150 separate incidents, including 50 public order offences and 40 assaults. CCTV footage shows a co-ordinated move by a known group of individuals towards the directors' box. Measures including increased security presence and preventing fans approaching the area holding members of the West Ham board were announced in late March. Entirely funded by the UK taxpayer and costed at £60,000, the provisions were planned for the next game, against Southampton. In June 2018, West Ham were charged by the FA with offences relating to crowd disturbances at the game against Burnley in March. In January 2019, West Ham were fined £100,000 for the disturbances. The Football Association investigation of the incidents was heavily critical of stadium operators, London Stadium 185 (LS185), and found that they had left sections which were damaging to the company out of their report. As LS185 were in control of the stadium's operations and were blamed for their actions in the disturbances (including cutting the number of stewards, poor training and unsatisfactory response to pitch invasions), West Ham sought to split the fine with the company. On 31 October 2018, during West Ham's EFL Cup game against Tottenham Hotspur, further pitch invasions took place with one invader wearing a Scream mask.\n\nIn May 2014 it was announced that the Essex Eagles had agreed a deal in principle to play Twenty20 cricket matches at the stadium. The venue was also touted as a possible venue for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. However, the venue was not included in the final fixtures list. The stadium was not chosen due to the existing facilities running east to west which would have made the game difficult to watch, due to the setting sun, as at most cricket venues the pitch runs north to south. After investigation it was discovered that the stadium's capacity would decrease by 30,000 after they turned the facilities to a north–south alignment. The International Cricket Council additionally had concerns over potential serious injuries to players caused by the raised sand based outfield.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, Major League Baseball announced a two-year deal to host a series of baseball games at London Stadium in 2019 and 2020. The Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees (a major rivalry in the American League) played a two-game series at London Stadium from 29 to 30 June 2019, branded as the 2019 MLB London Series. In its baseball configuration, the stadium had a capacity of 66,000; plans were prepared to adjust the stadium's seating to emulate the \"intimate\" experience and amenities of American baseball stadiums, as well as constructing larger locker rooms akin to the clubhouses of U.S. parks. A new playing surface was overlaid on top of the stadium's existing grass.\n\nPrior to the 2019 games, it was announced that the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals would play games at London Stadium in 2020.\n\nIn November 2015 the stadium hosted the 2015 Race of Champions event. It was the first occasion since 2008 that Great Britain hosted the event, with Wembley Stadium last staging the contest in 2008. The English team of Andy Priaulx and Jason Plato won the nations cup whilst Sebastian Vettel took the Champion of Champions crown.\n\nThe first rugby league match at the stadium was played between England and New Zealand on 7 November 2015, it was the second test of a three-test series between the sides. The venue also hosted the match between England and Australia as part of the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations. In June 2016, it was announced that the Stadium will form part of England's bid to host the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.\n\nIn July 2012 the Olympic Park Legacy Company submitted a bid to England Rugby 2015 to host some matches of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. On 2 May 2013, it was officially announced that the Olympic Stadium was due to host four Pool matches during the World Cup and the Bronze final. The first rugby union match at the stadium took place on 29 August 2015 as part of a testing programme ahead of the World Cup. The match featured the first ever game between the invitational Barbarians side and Samoa. The Barbarians won 27–24, with Samoa having Kane Thompson sent off for punching. The game was delayed when pitch sprinklers came on during the first half.\n\nAt fixture launch on 7 July 2017, it was announced that Saracens would host their annual \"Derby Day\" clash against Harlequins at the London Stadium on 24 March 2018. This was the first time since 2010 that this fixture did not take place at Wembley. The match ended in a 24–11 win for Saracens in front of a crowd of 55,329 and was the first ever Premiership Rugby match at the stadium. The match was repeated in 2019 which ended as a 27–20 win for Saracens in front of a crowd of 42,717.\n\nThe stadium is located in the south of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Stratford and Stratford International railway stations are the main stations nearest to the Olympic Park, and are roughly a 20-minute walk to the stadium. Stratford International is served by Southeastern trains on High Speed 1 offering four trains per hour to St Pancras International, as well as other services to Kent, while Stratford station has London Overground services to North, West and South London, and is on the Great Eastern Main Line to London Liverpool Street and East Anglia. Stratford is on London Underground's Jubilee and Central lines to Central London and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). The DLR offers a direct service to London City Airport. In addition, Hackney Wick (London Overground) and Pudding Mill Lane (DLR) serve the stadium, but may be closed during bigger events due to capacity limitations. From 2019 the stadium will be served by Crossrail.\n\nStations nearby:\n\nTravellers by car are advised to use the public car parks at Westfield Stratford City, Stratford International station and the Stratford Centre. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park also has several docking stations for the London Cycle Hire scheme.\n\nThe following routes serve the London Stadium directly:\n\nA further 17 services use Stratford bus station and Stratford City bus station, which offer a network of services across East London. In addition, route 25 from City Thameslink serves Central London.\n\nNational Express coach services to Stratford bus station provide a direct connection to Stansted Airport and several other routes to Essex and East Anglia.\n\n"}

{"id": "2179609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179609", "title": "Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock", "text": "Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock\n\nRob Base and DJ E-Z Rock were an American hip hop duo from Harlem, New York. They were best known for the 1988 hit \"It Takes Two\", a single that was a top 40 hit and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. That song was a part of the duo's album of the same name, which also has been certified platinum. They are also known for being pioneers of the crossover success that rap music would have in the popular music mainstream. The duo consisted of Rob Base (Robert Ginyard, born May 18, 1967) and DJ E-Z Rock (Rodney \"Skip\" Bryce, born 1967; died April 27, 2014).\n\nThe duo's first U.S. single and release was \"DJ Interview,\" appearing on World to World, which later got them a recording contract with Profile Records in 1987. The duo was assisted by a long time friend from New Jersey, producer David Wynn. David Wynn produced three songs on their debut album and five songs on their sophomore album.\n\nThe first Profile release was \"It Takes Two\". It uses multiple samples from the James Brown and Lyn Collins 1972 song \"Think (About It).\" The track first became a regional hit and then slowly climbed the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, picking up a multi-platinum single certification. The song also peaked at #3 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nAn album, also called \"It Takes Two\", was quickly put together and it produced a significant follow-up hit, \"Joy and Pain\", which sampled a song of the same name by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, as well as \"Put The Music Where Your Mouth Is\" by The Olympic Runners. It also hit the top 10 on the dance chart and climbed to #58 on the Hot 100. \"Get On the Dance Floor,\" produced by David Wynn (DJ Wynn), a track released to clubs in between the two singles, hit #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. Boosted by those singles the \"It Takes Two\" album went platinum seven times over. However, vicious rumors started to circulate that Rob Base had legal problems for using samples from Maze's Frankie Beverly for the hit \"Joy and Pain\", and he had his own personal problems. DJ E-Z Rock also was forced to leave the group due to his own personal issues, so Rob Base was left to be a solo artist.\n\nHe responded in 1989 with \"The Incredible Base\", his debut solo album. It did not sell as well as \"It Takes Two\". One song from the album hit the dance chart in late 1989: \"Turn It Out (Go Base)\", credited only to Rob Base.\n\nIn 2008, their song \"It Takes Two\" was ranked number 37 on VH1's 100 greatest songs of hip hop.\n\nRob Base, born Robert Ginyard on May 18,1967, was born and raised in Harlem (NY). He attended Harlem public schools and loved music. Influenced by rap, Rob began his journey and performed at many talent shows and any open mic, or hip-hop events that he could. Rob’s first child, De'Jené Ginyard, was born in 1989 to his then girlfriend Rhonda Dunbar, with whom he was in a relationship from 1986-90. In 1991, Rob met April and had a son, Robert Ginyard, Jr., in 1992, Later together, they took guardianship custody of April's cousin Dysell. Rob and April were then later married and remained together until her death in September 2013.\n\nDJ E-Z Rock died on April 27, 2014 after suffering a diabetic seizure at the age of 46.\n\n"}

They are compared to bands like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Missing Persons and The Sounds, although they are more electronic.\n\nAlice in Videoland describe themselves as a combination of minimal 80's synth pop music with an upbeat electronic body music (ebm) assault and a bitchy disco punk female singer.\n\nAlice in Videoland was formed in 2002 by singer Toril Lindqvist and former band member Carl Lundgren. The band gained a massive response on their very first demo with the original idea, which they still try to adhere to, of combining edgy synth-basses, ebm and electro with punk rock, and placing the edgy voice and melodies of Toril on top to create a unique style.\n\nAfter six months of being on the ‘demo market’ the band were signed to the National label and recruited Anders Alexander (drums and synths) and Johan Dahlbom (bass). The recording of their debut album \"Maiden Voyage\" (2003) began. At the same time the band took the local club scene by storm with their energetic live shows.\n\nTheir second album \"Outrageous!\" was released in 2005 and by that time the band had gained an underground worldwide fan base. The single \"Cut The Crap\" opened up the US market for the band and a contract was signed with US label Storming The Base. Before the release of \"Outrageous!\" Carl Lundgren left the band and was replaced by Dominique who later also left the band due to his own projects. The guitarist Martin Kenzo plays now in their place.\n\nMore recently Alice in Videoland has returned to release their third album \"She’s A Machine!\" in 2008, which the band described as harder and edgier than their previous works.\n\nIn 2010 Alice In Videoland released their latest single \"Spaceship\" which became the band's first radio hit in Sweden and on November 2 the same year, they released their fourth album \"A Million Thoughts And They´re All About You\". The band also made their first video ( \"In A Band\") in 5 years.\n\nIn April 2015, after a nearly four-year hiatus, the band announced that their new single \"Let Go\" would be released in May, and their would-be fifth album \"Forever\" would be released sometime later in 2015. The album never materialized, but a second single, \"Stand\", was released later that year.\n\nIn November of 2018, the band announced on their facebook page that they would be disbanding after playing a few final gigs in 2019, and that they would be releasing a limited edition \"Best of Alice in Videoland\" compilation on vinyl featuring two new songs. A new single \"Souls on Fire\" with b-side \"Shocker\" was released digitally on December 24, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The OpenEmbedded framework is developed by the OpenEmbedded community, which was formally established in 2003. OpenEmbedded is the recommended build system of the Yocto Project, which is a Linux Foundation workgroup that assists commercial companies in the development of Linux-based systems for embedded products.\n\nThe build system is based on BitBake \"recipes\", which specify how a particular package is built, but also includes lists of dependencies and source code locations, as well as instructions on how to install and remove a compiled package. OpenEmbedded tools use these recipes to fetch and patch source code, compile and link binaries, produce binary packages (ipk, deb, rpm), and create bootable images.\n\nHistorically, OpenEmbedded's collection of recipes were stored in a single repository, and the metadata was structured in a form now called \"OpenEmbedded-Classic\". By 2010, it had become increasingly difficult to manage the ever-growing number of recipes. To resolve this, recipe metadata was split into multiple layers. The lowest layer, which includes platform-independent and distribution-independent metadata is called \"OpenEmbedded-Core\". Architecture-specific, application-specific and distribution-dependent instructions are applied in appropriate target support layers that can override or complement the instructions from lower layers. Additionally, changes to the recipes at the core layer are now managed with a pull model: instead of committing their changes directly to the repository (as was previously the case), developers now send their patches to the mailing list. The patches, if approved, are then merged (pulled) by a maintainer. \n\nThe OpenEmbedded framework can be installed and automatically updated via Git.\n\nThe \"OpenEmbedded Project\" (\"OE\" for short) was created by Chris Larson, Michael Lauer, and Holger Schurig, merging the achievements of OpenZaurus with contributions from projects like Familiar Linux and OpenSIMpad into a common codebase. OpenEmbedded superseded these projects and was used to build any of them from the same code base. Stable maintenance builds exist for the old OpenEmbedded-Classic, although most development is, or will be, based on the new OpenEmbedded-Core in the future.\n\nThe \"OpenEmbedded-Core\" Project (\"OE-Core\" for short) resulted from the merge of the Yocto Project with OpenEmbedded. This is the most recent version of OpenEmbedded and many of the OE-dev recipes are available in OE-Core. Newer versions of package recipes may only get ported for OpenEmbedded-Core.\n\nOpenEmbedded-Core has adapted this layered structure in the merge with Yocto and new layer entries were added over time. The Layers represent a structure which is only of declarative nature. The specific entries are stricter in the scope of deciding which entry provides which packages. Overview of layers is available in: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn OpenEmbedded-Classic, the configurations from Base- to the UI-Layer can be supplemented by various Linux distributions.

The Engine division and Sukhoi division of the aircraft manufacturing company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a public sector undertaking (PSU) of Ministry of Defence is in Sunabeda.\n\nOther major establishments of this town are Naval Armament Depot (NAD), State government offices, Sports Authority of India hostel, Central University of Orissa (CUO) and Battalion headquarter of Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA).\n\nCreated around 1965, mainly to accommodate HAL employees, Sunabeda is a planned and organized township. It is situated around 1,000 meters above sea level. Prior to its creation, this place was known as Old Sunabeda which was occupied by native tribal community. About a thousand tribals in and around Chikapar village were displaced and rendered homeless to give way for the HAL factory. Even though the factory was made with Russian collaboration, the township and factory buildings were executed by state engineers of Odisha. The project was named Aero Engine Factory (AEF) Project. The residential colony is called AEF Colony with a Chief Engineer responsible towards it.\n\nAfter the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War a shelter camp for the Bangladeshi refugees was constructed which became Sunabeda–3, which today predominantly comprises Bengali Hindu people. The Odisha Small Industries Corporation established the Odisha Timber and Engineering Works adjacent to NH-43. Most Bengali people joined here as carpenters. When the Kolab dam was constructed a catchment formed around Sunabeda in the form of a big lake. Some of the Bengali people took to fishing and today Sunabeda is a centre for making fishing boats and nets for which fishermen from as far as Malkangiri come to buy their provisions.\nThere was little growth in Sunabeda and on the other hand the hustle and bustle gradually started dwindling as the AEF project closed after commencement of production in HAL. Similarly fresh recruitment in HAL stopped after a while and people started retiring and the post remained vacant as the Mikoyan (MIG) series of aircraft was losing out to new series of aircraft.\n\nIn the late 1980s the setting up of the NAD and the National Aluminium Company (NALCO) in Damanjodi kept the overall situation alive in Sunabeda and Semiliguda. Things started looking brighter after the Sukhoi Su-30 production meant a new division in HAL. The arrival of the Battalion Headquarters of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA), as well as the Central University and the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) are hoped to provide some growth to the area.\n\nSunabeda is located 20 km east of Koraput. There are frequent buses and taxis from Koraput. Though the closest railway station is at Dumuriput, Damanjodi and Koraput, a majority of the people prefer alighting at Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh. The National Highway 26 (previously NH-43) running over the mountains and forest make the journey to Sunabeda an unforgettable experience.\n\nThere are basically three areas in Sunabeda defined as Sunabeda - I, II, III, these being AEF Colony, the H A L township and the N A C (notified area council) respectively. They are so called because of the last digit in the PINCODE.\n\nWith lush green flora all around the hills and hillocks it is a place worth seeing. The HAL Nursery while open to the public is worth a visit. There is also a deer park adjoining the nursery. A museum on the outskirts of the township is to house the developmental history of the place as well as the factory.\n\nSunabeda is a well planned and beautiful township with adjoining areas like PHED Colony, AEF Colony, Shantinagar, NAC, Semliguda, D.P. Camp, Jadaguda, Malliguda, Jersey Farm, Timber, and Damanjodi. Moreover, many of hill stations and water falls surrounded near by. The HAL factory is located in the center of the town, employees around six thousand people, and provides residential quarters for the employees and staff of the company. The entire township is divided into sectors which are further divided into zones starting from A to Y, the 'R' zone being the largest. There are other zones listed as RA, QA, LA, NG, UA, JA, IB, KG,GG etc.\n\n India census, Sunabeda had a population of 58,647. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Sunabeda has an average literacy rate of 62%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 69%, and female literacy is 54%. In Sunabeda, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nThe oldest school but relatively less known is the Government High School at Sunabeda-1 which has one alumni Sri Jayaram Pangi as a Member of Parliament. Most educated people in the old parts of the town are likely to be products of this elite school belonging to the T&R Department.\n\nIn order to provide continual and quality education to transferable central government employees comprising serving Officers and sailors of Indian Navy, Navy civilians and counterparts from Army and Airforce of Sunabeda along with retired authorised personnel and few local populace, NAD KV Sunabeda has been established in the year 1989 (from class -1 to class-V) and to presently class-12 has been functioning satisfactorily under the aegis of KV Sangathan with students hailing from far off places like Koraput, Damanjodi etc.\n\nFor employees of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) factory, Aeronautics Education Society (AES) established a co-educational English medium School in year 1968, Vyomayana Samstha Vidyalaya(VSV) formerly called the DAV English Medium School with classes from LKG - Std XII. It's located at the edge of township near the Utkal Cinema hall. It has 3 buildings - Primary which has LKG to Std 5 students, Secondary for class 6 to 8 students and the main building for 9th to class 12th. All board exams 10th and 12th are held on premises and is affiliated to board of Secondary education with CBSE course studies.\nThe only missionary school, Jeevan Jyothi convent school is situated at Semiliguda 5 km from Sunabeda. There is also the Sunabeda Public School (ICSE)in the A.E.F. Colony. The Sunabeda Public School founded in 1965 is the oldest English-medium school in the erstwhile undivided Koraput district . It is a co-educational residential school having classes from LKG to Class XII. The other schools are A.G.H. School, and A.D.A.V. School. The primary schools are: A Zone School, D Zone School, R Zone School, U Zone School and I Zone School.\n\nFor the development of women's education in Sunabeda there is women's college named as Sunabeda Women's College. Aurobindo Integral School, and Saraswati Vidya Mandir (founded in 1985) were also established for the development of education in the NAC area. Saaraswati Vidya Mandir is an Oriya medium school, affiliated to board of secondary education, Bhubaneswar.\n\nSunabeda is situated on NH 26 which connects Raipur and Bargarh. The nearest railway stations are:\n\nThe nearest airport is in Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh (188 km).\n\nSunabeda is well connected with rest of Odisha as well as nearby districts of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with huge number of buses. Recently Jeypore - Koraput - Sunabeda City Bus Service has been started and it caters well to the transportation needs of Sunabedians.\n\n\nThere is big stadium in middle of the Township. Many Divisional events are observed in this stadium. Independence Day and Republic Days are celebrated in a grand way. Hockey, Football, Cricket and other athletic meets are held in this stadium. National level football tournament are organised in this ground in every two years. Teams from different parts of our Country are participating in this tournament.\n\nThere is also Sports club at HAL Township. Apart from it, Sunabeda has a Sports training center which is run by HAL in collaboration with Sports Authority of India. The training center primarily trains students of age group 13–15 years old, in archery and football for three years and is managed by a sports officer Mr. Ramesh Thakur, who happens to be a HAL employee. Candidates are selected from adjourning districts of Koraput. Trainees of this centre have participated at National level championship in Archery and brought laurels for the State.\n\nSunabeda has a very old Jagannath Temple, older than Koraput Jagannath temple which holds Annual Rath Yatra that ends at HAL Open Air Pandal. This event is an important annual event in Sunabeda. Maa Banadurga temple at Shantinagar is the oldest temple of the Region, where the tribals celebrate their annual \"Chaita Parba\", the oldest annual event of the entire Sunabeda region.\n\nThe major cultural events in Sunabeda are the Rath Yatra, the Viswakarma Puja, Dussehra and other festivals. There is a Jagannath temple in AEF Colony and L zone in HAL Township. Maha Sivaratri which is celebrated at the temple of Shiva atop a hillock just close to the AEF Colony bus stop, There is a Hanuman Temple in IB zone. There is also a Jagannath Temple at L-Zone named as Swarnakhetra, Tarini Temple at B-Zone, Mangala Temple at R-Zone and K-Zone, Gayatri Temple at G-zone, Santosimaa Temple at E-Zone, Satyasai Temple at F-zone and many more temple at HAL Township for the spiritual development of the people of the township. In the boundary of Jagannath Temple there is a Siva Temple where Baba Biswanath worshiped. Besides Siva and Jagannath there is also Ganesh Mandir and Laxmi Mandir. Arnapurna Mandap and Laxmi Mandap also constructed in the boundary of Jagannath Temple for social functions of the Township. At an extreme of the township, there exists a hill called Chikkappara. On the hill top is the oldest temple - \" Lord Siva Temple\" and Parvathi Temple at the bottom of the hill. By the side of the temple Lord Ayyaappa Temple is there, which was consecrated on 15 February 1989. There are a lot of stories related to this temple. On the time of consecration, an Eagle, which is rare in Sunabeda, revolved around the temple, like the eagle coming to Sabarimala temple. Every year on \"Mandala Puja\" day, water flows from the hill just behind the temple. This was predicted before the construction of the temple and it is happening every year since 1998. Only on that day the water flows and that also for about an hour during the Abhishekam time.\n\nEvery Year on the occasion of Ratha Yatra a colourful magazine is published called Swarnakhetra. Utkal Sanskrutika Parishad of Sunabeda is one of the oldest cultural Organization of Odisha in the township which is continuously playing a vital Role for the Development of the Odia Culture, Literature and Customs since 1966. The organization observes the Jayanti of Kabisamrat Upendrabhanja, Fakirmohan, Gangadhar, Madhusudan, Bijupatnaik, Nanda Kishore Bal. The organization also publishes an annual magazine called \"Smaranika\". The Banaphula Sahitya Parishad and The Banaprabha Sahitya Sansad are two other organizations that are continuously working for the development of Odia literature.\n"}

{"id": "2179639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179639", "title": "Obstruction theory", "text": "Obstruction theory\n\nIn mathematics, obstruction theory is a name given to two different mathematical theories, both of which yield cohomological invariants.\n\nIn the original work of Stiefel and Whitney, characteristic classes were defined as obstructions to the existence of certain fields of linear independent vectors. Obstruction theory turns out to be an application of cohomology theory to the problem of constructing a cross-section of a bundle.\n\nThe older meaning for obstruction theory in homotopy theory relates to the procedure, inductive with respect to dimension, for extending a continuous mapping defined on a simplicial complex, or CW complex. It is traditionally called \"Eilenberg obstruction theory\", after Samuel Eilenberg. It involves cohomology groups with coefficients in homotopy groups to define obstructions to extensions. For example, with a mapping from a simplicial complex \"X\" to another, \"Y\", defined initially on the 0-skeleton of \"X\" (the vertices of \"X\"), an extension to the 1-skeleton will be possible whenever the image of the 0-skeleton will belong to the same path-connected component of \"Y\". Extending from the 1-skeleton to the 2-skeleton means defining the mapping on each solid triangle from \"X\", given the mapping already defined on its boundary edges. Likewise, then extending the mapping to the 3-skeleton involves extending the mapping to each solid 3-simplex of \"X\", given the mapping already defined on its boundary. \n\nAt some point, say extending the mapping from the (n-1)-skeleton of \"X\" to the n-skeleton of \"X\", this procedure might be impossible. In that case, one can assign to each n-simplex the homotopy class of the mapping already defined on its boundary, (at least one of which will be non-zero). These assignments define an n-cochain with coefficients in . Amazingly, this cochain turns out to be a cocycle and so defines a cohomology class in the nth cohomology group of \"X\" with coefficients in . When this cohomology class is equal to 0, it turns out that the mapping may be modified within its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton of \"X\" so that the mapping may be extended to the n-skeleton of \"X\". If the class is not equal to zero, it is called the obstruction to extending the mapping over the n-skeleton, given its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton.\n\nSuppose that is a simply connected simplicial complex and that is a fibration with fiber . Furthermore, assume that we have a partially defined section on the -skeleton of .\n\nFor every -simplex in , can be restricted to its boundary (which is a topological -sphere). Because send each of these back to each , we have a map from an -sphere to . Because fibrations satisfy the homotopy lifting property, and is contractible; is homotopy equivalent to . So this partially defined section assigns an element of to every -simplex. This is precisely the data of a -valued simplicial cochain of degree on , i.e. an element of . This cochain is called the obstruction cochain because it being the zero means that all of these elements of are trivial, which means that our partially defined section can be extended to the -skeleton by using the homotopy between (the partially defined section on the boundary of each ) and the constant map.\n\nThe fact that this cochain came from a partially defined section (as opposed to an arbitrary collection of maps from all the boundaries of all the -simplices) can be used to prove that this cochain is a cocycle. If one started with a different partially defined section that agreed with the original on the -skeleton, then one can also prove that the resulting cocycle would differ from the first by a coboundary. Therefore we have a well-defined element of the cohomology group such that if a partially defined section on the -skeleton exists that agrees with the given choice on the -skeleton, then this cohomology class must be trivial.\n\nThe converse is also true if one allows such things as \"homotopy sections\", i.e. a map such that is homotopic (as opposed to equal) to the identity map on . Thus it provides a complete invariant of the existence of sections up to homotopy on the -skeleton.\n\n\nIn geometric topology, obstruction theory is concerned with when a topological manifold has a piecewise linear structure, and when a piecewise linear manifold has a differential structure.\n\nIn dimension at most 2 (Rado), and 3 (Morse), the notions of topological manifolds and piecewise linear manifolds coincide. In dimension 4 they are not the same.\n\nIn dimensions at most 6 the notions of piecewise linear manifolds and differentiable manifolds coincide.\n\nThe two basic questions of surgery theory are whether a topological space with \"n\"-dimensional Poincaré duality is homotopy equivalent to an \"n\"-dimensional manifold, and also whether a homotopy equivalence of \"n\"-dimensional manifolds is homotopic to a diffeomorphism. In both cases there are two obstructions for \"n>9\", a primary topological K-theory obstruction to the existence of a vector bundle: if this vanishes there exists a normal map, allowing the definition of the secondary surgery obstruction in algebraic L-theory to performing surgery on the normal map to obtain a homotopy equivalence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179648", "title": "Boris Kustodiev", "text": "Boris Kustodiev\n\nBoris Mikhaylovich Kustodiev (; – 28 May 1927) was a Russian and Soviet painter and stage designer.\n\nBoris Kustodiev was born in Astrakhan into the family of a professor of philosophy, history of literature, and logic at the local theological seminary. His father died young, and all financial and material burdens fell on his mother's shoulders. The Kustodiev family rented a small wing in a rich merchant's house. It was there that the boy's first impressions were formed of the way of life of the provincial merchant class. The artist later wrote, \"The whole tenor of the rich and plentiful merchant way of life was there right under my nose... It was like something out of an Ostrovsky play.\" The artist retained these childhood observations for years, recreating them later in oils and water-colours.\n\nBetween 1893 and 1896, Kustodiev studied in theological seminary and took private art lessons in Astrakhan from Pavel Vlasov, a pupil of Vasily Perov. Subsequently, from 1896 to 1903, he attended Ilya Repin’s studio at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. Concurrently, he took classes in sculpture under Dmitry Stelletsky and in etching under Vasiliy Mate. He first exhibited in 1896.\n\n\"I have great hopes for Kustodiev,\" wrote Repin. \"He is a talented artist and a thoughtful and serious man with a deep love of art; he is making a careful study of nature...\" When Repin was commissioned to paint a , he invited Kustodiev to be his assistant. The painting was extremely complex and involved a great deal of hard work. Together with his teacher, the young artist made portrait studies for the painting, and then executed the right-hand side of the final work. Also at this time, Kustodiev made a series of portraits of contemporaries whom he felt to be his spiritual comrades. These included the artist Ivan Bilibin (1901, Russian Museum), Moldovtsev (1901, Krasnodar Regional Art Museum), and the engraver Mate (1902, Russian Museum). Working on these portraits considerably helped the artist, forcing him to make a close study of his model and to penetrate the complex world of the human soul.\n\nIn 1903, he married Julia Proshinskaya (1880–1942).\n\nHe visited France and Spain on a grant from the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1904. Also in 1904, he attended the private studio of René Ménard in Paris. After that he traveled to Spain, then, in 1907, to Italy, and in 1909 he visited Austria and Germany, and again France and Italy. During these years he painted many portraits and genre pieces. However, no matter where Kustodiev happened to be – in sunny Seville or in the park at Versailles – he felt the irresistible pull of his\nmotherland. After five months in France he returned to Russia, writing with evident joy to his friend Mate that he was back once more \"in our blessed Russian land\".\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1905, which shook the foundations of society, evoked a vivid response in the artist's soul. He contributed to the satirical journals \"Zhupel\" (Bugbear) and \"Adskaya Pochta\" (Hell’s Mail). At that time, he first met the artists of \"Mir Iskusstva\" (World of Art), the group of innovative Russian artists. He joined their association in 1910 and subsequently took part in all their exhibitions.\n\nIn 1905, Kustodiev first turned to book illustrating, a genre in which he worked throughout his entire life. He illustrated many works of classical Russian literature, including Nikolai Gogol's \"Dead Souls\", \"The Carriage\", and \"The Overcoat\"; Mikhail Lermontov's \"The Lay of Tsar Ivan Vasilyevich, His Young Oprichnik and the Stouthearted Merchant Kalashnikov\"; and Leo Tolstoy's \"How the Devil Stole the Peasants Hunk of Bread\" and \"The Candle\".\n\nIn 1909, he was elected into Imperial Academy of Arts. He continued to work intensively, but a grave illness—tuberculosis of the spine—required urgent attention. On the advice of his doctors he went to Switzerland, where he spent a year undergoing treatment in a private clinic. He pined for his distant homeland, and Russian themes continued to provide the basic material for the works he painted during that year. In 1918, he painted \"The Merchant's Wife\", which became the most famous of his paintings.\n\nIn 1916, he became paraplegic. \"Now my whole world is my room\", he wrote. His ability to remain joyful and lively despite his paralysis amazed others. His colourful paintings and joyful genre pieces do not reveal his physical suffering, and on the contrary give the impression of a carefree and cheerful life.\n\nHis \"Pancake Tuesday/Maslenitsa\" (1916) and \"Fontanka\" (1916) are all painted from his memories. He meticulously restores his own childhood in the busy city on the Volga banks.\n\nIn the first years after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the artist worked with great inspiration in various fields. Contemporary themes became the basis for his work, being embodied in drawings for calendars and book covers, and in illustrations and sketches of street decorations, as well as some portraits (\"Portrait of Countess Grabowska\"). \n\nHis covers for the journals \"The Red Cornfield\" and \"Red Panorama\" attracted attention because of their vividness and the sharpness of their subject matter. Kustodiev also worked in lithography, illustrating works by Nekrasov. His illustrations for Leskov's stories \"The Darner\" and \"Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District\" were landmarks in the history of Russian book designing, so well did they correspond to the literary images.\n\nThe artist was also interested in designing stage scenery. He first started work in the theatre in 1911, when he designed the sets for Alexander Ostrovsky's \"An Ardent Heart\". Such was his success that further orders came pouring in. In 1913, he designed the sets and costumes for \"The Death of Pazukhin\" at the Moscow Art Theatre.\n\nHis talent in this sphere was especially apparent in his work for Ostrovsky's plays; \"It's a Family Affair\", \"A Stroke of Luck\", \"Wolves and Sheep\", and \"The Storm\". The milieu of Ostrovsky's plays—provincial life and the world of the merchant class—was close to Kustodiev's own genre paintings, and he worked easily and quickly on the stage sets.\n\nIn 1923, Kustodiev joined the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia. He continued to paint, make engravings, illustrate books, and design for the theater up until his death of tuberculosis on 28 May 1927, in Leningrad.\n\n\n"}

Calculations suggested that such a system enhanced the cross section by many orders of magnitude. It is a particular implementation of the larger beam-target fusion concept.\n\nThe idea was first reported by researchers at Brookhaven in 1989. Intrigued by recent reports of cold fusion, they attempted to study potential causes for the effect by accelerating tiny droplets of heavy water, about 25 to 1300 D2O molecules each, into a target at about 220 eV. To their surprise they immediately saw fusion effects, at a rate that was many times what any of them could explain via conventional theory.\n\nThe experiment was fairly simple in concept but required an appropriate accelerator, so it was some time before other labs were able to repeat the experiments. One of the first was the University of Washington, who reported a null result in 1991. Further experiments and a review from MIT in 1992 solved the mystery: the fusion products were the results of contamination, which could be eliminated by filtering with a magnet. The Brookhaven experimenters tried this and the effect disappeared. Cluster fusion references end abruptly at that point.\n\n\n Estimates of cluster-impact fusion yields\n\n"}

It was built in 1975 to a height of , making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. The 55-story building is cylindrical, with an open centre allowing additional light into the apartments. The centre space is known as \"the core\" and rises above an uneven rock floor. When built, Ponte City was seen as an extremely desirable address due to its views over all of Johannesburg and its surroundings. The neon sign on top of the building is the largest sign in the southern hemisphere and advertised for the Coca-Cola Company prior to 2000. It currently advertises the South African mobile phone company Vodacom. \n\nThe principal designer of Ponte was Mannie Feldman, working in a team together with Manfred Hermer and Rodney Grosskopff. Grosskopff recalled the decision to make the building circular, the first cylindrical skyscraper in Africa. At the time, Johannesburg bylaws required kitchens and bathrooms to have a window, so Grosskopff designed the building with a hollow interior, allowing light to enter the apartments from both sides. At the bottom of the immense building were retail stores and initial plans were to include an indoor ski slope on the inner core floor. The building was so tall because developers wanted a large number of units but had a limited land to build on. The building is located 35 minutes from the OR Tambo International Airport and almost within walking distance of the inner city with theatres like the Market and the Civic within .\n\nDuring the late 1980s, gang activity had caused the crime rate to soar at the tower and the surrounding neighbourhood. By the 1990s, many gangs moved into the building and it became extremely unsafe. Ponte City became symbolic of the crime and urban decay gripping the once cosmopolitan Berea neighbourhood. The core filled with debris five stories high as the owners left the building to decay. There were even proposals in the mid-1990s to turn the building into a highrise prison. In 2001 Trafalgar Properties took over management of the building and began making numerous improvements.\n\nIn May 2007 Ponte changed ownership and a re-development project \"New Ponte\" was put in motion. David Selvan and Nour Addine Ayyoub under Ayyoub's company, Investagain, planned to revitalise the building completely. The planned development would have contained 467 residential units, retail and leisure-time areas. Over the next few years, the Johannesburg Development Agency planned to invest about R900 million in the areas around Ponte City such as the Ellis Park Precinct project as well as an upgrade of Hillbrow and Berea partly in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe subprime mortgage crisis caused the banks not to provide the funding required to finish the revitalisation and so the project was cancelled and ownership was given back to the Kempston Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Following the 1893 death of his brother Tieba Traoré, Babemba assumed the Kénédougou throne. The capital, Sikasso, was beset at this time by both the Mandinka forces of Samory Touré and by the rapidly advancing French colonial army. The neighboring Toucouleur Empire's capital at Ségou had fallen to the French the previous year, leaving the French free to focus on subduing the Kénédougou.\n\nIn April 1898, the French began a major artillery barrage against Sikasso's walls; the city itself fell on May 1, 1898. Rather than surrender to the French, Babemba ordered his guards to kill him, an action still celebrated in Mali today. Samory Touré was captured in September of the same year, marking the effective end of West African resistance to French rule.\n\nMansa Douala, Traoré was the father of Tieba Traore, Babemba (Bangaly Traore), and Sillatequi Traore and others. Tieba Traore was the youngest brother of Babemba Traore and Sillatequi(spelling) Traore, and after the war, and calm returned to Kenedougou the two elder brothers set out on a new journey in two different directions, for farming, the now Guinea direction and the now Burkina Faso direction, leaving Tieba Traore the youngest home with his mother, the youngest of the wives. Tieba Traore was left in charge of the family home with his mother, but realizing that his mother was not happy in Duru (spelling), he took off to his mother's home, Sikasso, Mali where he was warmly welcomed by his uncles and maternal family. Because of the status of the family, he was received as the head of the Traore, and the town Sikasso became the new headquarter of the Traore. He became a fearless warrior defending his people. He built a strong force in Sikasso and later the Tata (the wall) when it was heard that Samori Toure and his men were passing through Sikasso. Samori and his men arrived in Sikasso en route for an all out assault, he requested that the people of Sikasso give him 43 men and 43 women to take his war material and food to the battle ground, which Tieba Traore and his men refused, because they were ready to fight Samori Toure. Samori Toure and men could not enter the Tata (the wall) because it was fortified and any attempt by Toure and men could have resulted in a blood bath. Toure decided to take a chance by waiting at the Mamelon with his men where they survived on fruit's seeds. The seeds became trees and are a part of Sikasso's history. Samori Toure could not penetrate the town of Sikasso because of the wall. The people had already made sacrifice, making sure that they maintained control of the city of Sikasso. In the end, no war took place between Samouri Toure and Tieba Traore.\n\nWhen the French were about to extend their rule onto Sikasso, they called a meeting with Tieba Traore in Segou. After the meeting, the commander of the French forces decided to escort Tieba Traore back to Sikasso. Tieba Traore decided that leaving the commander to return was not in his best interest at that time. The force in Sikasso killed the French commander which led to the first all out confrontation between Tieba Traore and the French. The French forces were defeated during the first attack, and some were killed; their graves can be found in Sikasso. The French decided to regroup to attack Sikasso for the second time, and it was during the second attack that Tieba Traore didn't survive, but there are no details on his death.\n\nHis brother Babemba was on the side now called Guinea when he learned about the war and his brother's death. He secretly left his family without any detail as to where he was going. During Babemba's stay in Sikasso, the French decided to make the final push to take complete control over the town of Sikasso, and it was during this time that Bambemba and the force of Tieba had to defend the town. But with heavy cannons, the French were able to blast the Tata (the wall) to enter the town of Sikasso and it became a blood bath. Babemba(Bangaly Traore) told his men that he would not going to be captured and treated the way Samori Toure was. He told one of his men to shoot him when he realized that there was no way out. Even though he was there to sympathize with his brother's family, he was also dissatisfied with the manner in which his sister was used as the sacrifice of the town of Sikasso. He could not hold his brother responsible for the fact that she was sacrificed in his absence, and that she volunteered to be the sacrificial lamb for the town to keep the town safe from Samori Toure and any attack. After Samori's departure from Sikasso, it was not too long that the French captured Samori Toure and he was sent to Gabon to serve time, and died there.\n\nThe stadium of Sikasso, Stade Babemba Traoré, today bears his name.\n\n"}

These measures included the construction of the Atlantic wall, along with reorganization of the Luftwaffe for air defense. This use of the term \"Fortress Europe\" was subsequently adopted by correspondents and historians in the English language to describe the military efforts of the Axis powers at defending the continent from the Allies.\n\nCurrently, within Europe, the term is used either to describe dumping effect of external borders in commercial matters, or as a pejorative description of the state of immigration into the European Union. This can be in reference either to attitudes toward immigration, to border fortification policies pursued for instance in the Spanish North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla or to the system of border patrols and detention centers that are used to help prevent illegal immigration into the European Union. \n\nFor conservative parties such as the Freedom Party of Austria, 'Fortress Europe' is a positive term. They mostly claim that such a fortress does not really exist yet, and that illegal immigrants can enter Europe far too easily. They often charge the southern states with insufficient border control, claiming that the latter are acting on the knowledge that immigrants tend to be more attracted to western/northern states with more generous welfare systems (Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden etc.). Conservatives all over Europe want to end the Schengen Agreement and to re-install border controls because they say it leads to mass migration of illegals and also free traffic of criminals.

For his activities, he received the title of \"Savior of the Fatherland\" and was one of the contenders for the royal throne at the Zemsky Sobor of 1613.\n\nTrubetskoy was first mentioned on April 11, 1607.

It was first described by Oldfield Thomas in 1888, after he identified that a museum specimen labelled as an eastern pygmy possum in fact represented a species then unknown to science. The holotype resides in the British Museum of Natural History.\n\nAlthough it is a marsupial, the Tasmanian pygmy possum superficially resembles a dormouse, and it is the smallest of all the known species of possum. Adults range from in head-body length, with a tail, and weigh just . Their fur is soft and thick, and is fawn in colour over most of the body, fading to a pale grey on the underparts.\n\nThe snout is short with long whiskers, and the eyes are directed forwards and surrounded by slightly darker fur, although without the conspicuous black rings seen on other pygmy possums. The ears are mobile and largely hairless. The tail is prehensile, and thickly furred at the base, which may be widened by fat stores beneath the skin. The remainder of the tail is relatively narrow and cylindrical, with only sparse hair between numerous tiny scales.\n\nThe Tasmanian pygmy possum is found throughout Tasmania, but was at one time thought to be extinct elsewhere. In 1964, a living animal was discovered on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, and further populations have since been discovered in the Murray-Darling basin in South Australia and Victoria. There are no formally recognised subspecies, although it has been proposed, based on genetic information, that the mainland and Tasmanian populations may be subspecies, or even entirely separate species. They inhabit sclerophyll forest, mallee, and open heathland vegetation.\n\nThe oldest fossils for this species date from the late Pleistocene, and were found on the mainland, with the oldest known Tasmanian fossils being much younger. Fossils have been found as far afield as eastern Victoria and New South Wales, suggesting that the species was once much more widespread than it is today.\n\nThe Tasmanian pygmy possum is nocturnal and arboreal. It lives primarily in shrubland or forest undergrowth, and, although a good climber, rarely ventures into the higher branches of trees, presumably because this would make it more vulnerable to avian predators. Pygmy possums use strips of bark to construct dome-like nests in tree cavities or rotten wood, but are solitary animals that do not share their nests with other individuals except for their own young.\n\nTasmanian pygmy possums are omnivorous, feeding on insects, spiders, small lizards, nectar, and pollen, the latter two primarily coming from \"Banksia\" and eucalypts. Their preference for eating pollen without destroying the host flower may mean that they help to pollinate some species of plant. Known predators include Tasmanian devils, quolls, kookaburra, masked owls, and tiger snakes.\n\nDuring cold weather, especially below about 6 °C (43 °F), Tasmanian pygmy possums have the ability to enter torpor. While in this state, body temperature drops, and oxygen consumption falls to just 1% of normal.\n\nBreeding occurs throughout the year, although it may be more common in spring and summer. The female has a well-developed pouch containing four teats, which therefore limits the maximum size of a litter to this number. The young leave the pouch at around 42 days, although they may cling to the mother's fur and be carried about after this age. They leave the nest to fend for themselves at around 90 days of age.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179740", "title": "History of religion in the Netherlands", "text": "History of religion in the Netherlands\n\nThe history of religion in the Netherlands has been characterized by considerable diversity of religious thought and practice. From 1600 until the second half of the 20th century, the north and west were Calvinist and the southeast was in majority Catholic, with Muslims and other religions concentrated in ethnic neighborhoods in the cities. Since the 1960s the Netherlands has become one of the most non-religious countries in the western world. In a December 2014 survey by the VU Amsterdam was concluded that for the first time there are more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands. The majority of the population being agnostic (31%) or ietsist (27%).\n\nBefore the advent of Christianity, the Netherlands were populated by Celtic tribes in the South, which adhered to Celtic polytheism, and Germanic tribes in the North, which adhered to Germanic paganism. After the Roman Empire occupied the later southern Netherlands, Roman mythology became important there, as well as religions from the Middle East, including relics from Egyptian mythology, Judaism, Mithraism and later Christianity.\n\nThe oldest data on the profession of religion by the inhabitants of the regions that are now the \"Netherlands\" were passed down by the Romans. Contrary to what ancient sources seem to suggest, the Rhine, which clearly formed the boundary of the Roman Empire, did certainly not form the boundary between residential areas of Celts and Germans. There were Germans south of it (Germani Cisrhenani) and many place names and archaeological finds indicate the presence of Celts north of the Rhine. Between these \"Celtic - Germanic peoples\" and later the Roman conquerors (romanization) a cultural exchange took place. An adaptation of polytheistic religions and other myths took place among the various tribes, coming from both the Germanic, Celtic and later Roman mythology. Gods as Nehalennia, Hludana and Sandraudiga are of indigenous (Celtic) origin, the Germanic people had gods like Wodan, Donar and Frigg/Freya from Scandinavia. For example, Jupiter, Minerva and Venus were introduced by the Romans. Tacitus also described the creation myth of Mannus, a primitive man from which all Germanic tribes would have emerged. The Celts and Germans in the Low Countries were also most likely to have had tree shrines, following the example of the Old Norse Yggdrasil and the Saxon Irminsul and Donar's oak. Temples were probably only build during and after the romanization, and have been preserved for example in Empel and Elst.\n\nFrom the 4th to the 6th century AD, the Great Migration took place, in which the small Celtic-Germanic-Roman tribes in the Low Countries were gradually supplanted by three major Germanic tribes: the Franks, the Frisians and Saxons. Around 500 the Franks, initially residing between the Rhine and the Somme, adopted Christianity, forced by their king Chlodovech. A large part of the area south of the Meuse belonged from the early Middle Ages to 1559 to Archdeacon Kempenland, which was part of the Diocese of Tongeren-Maastricht-Liège. From the center of the diocese, successively the cities of Tongeren, Maastricht and Liège, this part of the Netherlands was probably Christianized. According to tradition, the first Bishop of Maastricht, Servatius was buried in this city in 384, though only Bishop Domitianus (c. 535) is established to have resided in Maastricht. \nAt the start of the 6th century, the first (Hiberno-Scottish) missionaries arrived. They were later replaced by Anglo-Saxon missionaries, who eventually succeeded in converting most of the inhabitants of the southern Netherlands by the 8th century.\n\nFrom the late 7th century, missionaries coming from England and Ireland, such as Boniface, Lebuinus, Ludger, Plechelm, Willehad and especially Willibrord, sought to convert the inhabitants of the areas north of the Meuse and Rhine to Christianity with varying degrees of success, as evidenced by the (not always reliable) descriptions of their lives that have been written about them. Later, in addition to successful sermons, there were failures like the refusal of the Frisian king Radboud to be baptized by Wulfram. Because he would get to heaven by repenting, Radboud chose an afterlife with his ancestors who according to Wulfram were in hell. After the Frisian–Frankish wars (c. 600-793) and the Saxon Wars (772-804), the Low Countries all fell under the rule of the Christian Frankish kings, who wanted their people to subject both politically and religiously. A major source of that time is the Old Saxon Baptismal Vow, which describes how one must renounce his old gods (described as \"devils\") and subdue to the Christian trinity.\nIn the 8th century, Anglo-Saxon missionaries like Boniface attempted to Christianize the land inhabited by the Frisians. The Frisians resisted: Boniface was killed in 754 near Dokkum by the Frisians for the gold they thought he carried. The missionaries gradually succeeded in the conversion of the North in the 8th century. By the beginning of the 9th century, the Saxon-controlled northeastern regions were also subjugated and Christianized by Lebuinus, Plechelmus and Ludgerus.\nHowever, it would take at least until AD 1000 before all pagan people were actually Christianized and the Frisian and Saxon religions became extinct, although elements were incorporated into the Christian religion. The following centuries, Catholic Christianity was the only mainstream religion in the Netherlands.\n\nReligious life was ubiquitous in medieval society. Important abbeys such Rolduc, Susteren, Sint Odiliënberg and Egmond had a huge impact on the countryside. In the Christian centers of Utrecht and Maastricht powerful chapters were established. From the 13th century monastic and knightly orders settled in many cities, such as Franciscans, Dominicans and knights of the Teutonic Order. They took part in many of the 12th- and 13th-century crusades to the Holy Land (see Frisian participation in the Crusades). \nWhere justice until the 12th century existed by Kangaroo courts, which often meant Trial by ordeal to establish a person's guilt or innocence, the ecclesiastical and secular powers started in the course of the 12th century to control the justice system. The church rules (in particular by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215) and the monarchs maintained the order. At the end of the Middle Ages, the Devotio Moderna (among others Geert Groote and Thomas à Kempis) created a spiritual innovation. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the first calls were heard for religious reform, although inside the Catholic Church. Geert Groote established the Brethren of the Common Life, an influential mystical order, but only under the influence of humanism (among others Erasmus and Dirck Coornhert) changed the Dutch world fundamentally, and started to shift from a theocentric to an anthropocentric worldview.\n\nCatholicism dominated Dutch religion until the early 16th century, when the Protestant Reformation began to form. Early Protestantism in the form of Lutheranism did not gain much support among the Dutch, but Calvinism, introduced two decades later, did. It began its spread in the Westhoek and the County of Flanders, where secret sermons were held outdoors, called \"hagenpreken\" (\"hedgerow orations\") in Dutch. Gradually discontent among the Dutch grew, and erupted in 1566 with the so-called \"Beeldenstorm\", a surge of iconoclasm, which quickly spread among all Dutch regions and finally resulted in what would become the Dutch revolt. During the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation an independent Dutch religious tradition began to take shape in the northern parts of the independent Netherlands.\n\nThe most prominent Dutch theologian was the humanist Desiderius Erasmus. He was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform, but he kept his distance from Martin Luther and Philip Melancthon. He continued to recognise the authority of the pope. Erasmus emphasized a middle way, with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, and rejected Luther's emphasis on faith alone. Erasmus therefore remained a Catholic all his life. In relation to clerical abuses in the Church, Erasmus remained committed to reforming the Church from within. He also held to Catholic doctrines such as that of free will, which some Reformers rejected in favour of the doctrine of predestination. His middle road approach disappointed and even angered scholars in both camps.\n\nThe 16th and 17th century were characterized by the Protestant Reformation, which greatly influenced the history of the Netherlands, especially in western and northern areas of the country. The first wave of Reformation, initiated by Luther, did not come to the Netherlands. The second wave of the Protestant Reformation, Anabaptism, became very popular in the counties of Holland and Friesland. Anabaptists were very radical and believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live the old way, and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch Anabaptist was Menno Simons, who initiated the Mennonite church. Another Anabaptist, Jantje van Leyden became the ruler of a newly founded city, New Jerusalem. Anabaptists survived throughout the centuries and they were recognized by the States-General of the Netherlands in 1578. Institutionalized Dutch Baptism was a model for both English and American Baptists.\n\nThe third wave of the Reformation, Calvinism, arrived in the Netherlands in the 1540s, converting both parts of the elite and the common population, mostly in Flanders. The Spanish government, under Philip II started harsh persecution campaigns, supported by the Inquisition. In reaction to this persecution, the Calvinists rebelled. First there was the Beeldenstorm in 1566, which involved the destruction of religious depictions in churches. Also in 1566 William the Silent, Prince of Orange, a convert to Calvinism, started the Eighty Years' War to liberate the Calvinist Dutch from the Catholic Spaniards. The counties of Holland and Zeeland were conquered by Calvinists in 1572. A considerable number of people were Calvinist in Holland and Zeeland at that time already, while the other states remained almost entirely Catholic. The estates of Holland, led by Paulus Buys, decided to support William the Silent. All churches in the Calvinist territories became Calvinist and most of the population in these territories converted to or were forced to convert to Calvinism. Because the Netherlands had ceded from Spain over both political and religious issues, it practiced certain forms of tolerance towards people of certain other religions and opened its borders for religious dissenters (Protestants and Jews) from elsewhere, while maintaining its persecution and later discrimination against native Catholics. For instance, René Descartes lived in the Netherlands for most of his adult life.\n\nPhilip II of Spain was the hereditary ruler of the Netherlands. As a devout Catholic, Philip felt it was his duty to fight Protestantism. After the \"Beeldenstorm\", he sent troops to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands. The Spanish conquered the southern Netherlands (Flanders and Brabant). Protestants in this area, many of them prosperous merchants, fled \"en masse\" to Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. An extreme example was the city of Hondschoote, which dropped from 18,000 to a mere 385 inhabitants. Antwerp, formerly the most powerful city in the Low Countries, lost more than half its citizens to this exodus.\n\nIn the Calvinist-controlled northern counties, many of the remaining Catholics were tending towards converting to Protestantism for temporal gain, In the early 17th century, the Roman Catholic Jesuits launched large campaigns in order to rekindle faith among Catholics. In those areas where the Jesuits could operate, the Dutch Catholics were supported in their faith and some Calvinists reverted to Catholicism. However, the number of Catholics dwindled due to the lack of priests, especially in rural areas of Gelre, Overijssel, Groningen, and Friesland. At the same time, the larger western cities received an influx of Protestant immigrants from Germany, Flanders, and France and developed a Protestant character. Strict Calvinists converted a belt of land from the south west (the province of Zeeland), via the Veluwe, to the north of the Netherlands (to the city of Staphorst) during the 17th and even as late as the 18th centuries. This remains strict Calvinist until this day. During the Twelve Years' Truce (between 1609 and 1621) in the Eighty Years' War, the Netherlands saw a civil war along religious lines. The Synod of Dort tried to bring an end to an internal theological conflict within the Calvinist church between two tendencies of Calvinism: the liberal Arminians or Remonstrants and the strict Gomarists or Contra-Remonstrants. Civil war broke out in the 1610s between strict and liberal Calvinists. The liberal States of Holland left the Republic. The strict Calvinist side won (Prince Maurice of Orange and the other provinces) and the official head of state of the County of Holland, Johan van Oldebarnevelt, was executed. Calvinism became the de facto state religion and political offices could only be occupied by Calvinists (and in some cases, Jews). Other Christian religions were mostly tolerated, although discriminated against, and were not permitted to practice their religion in public. Judaism was allowed in public, Lutheranism only in larger cities on the condition of maintaining Calvinist church interior styles, without crucifixes as known in Scandinavian cathedrals.\n\nIn 1648, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire recognized the independence of the Netherlands in the Treaty of Westphalia. The Netherlands included the \"Seven Provinces\" of the Dutch Republic, which were Protestant, but also a Roman Catholic area. This \"Generaliteitsland\" was governed by the States-General; it roughly included the current provinces of North Brabant and Limburg. The Netherlands became known among Anglicans, many Protestants and Jews for its relative religious tolerance and became a refuge for the persecuted and a home for many of these migrants. The proportion of first-generation immigrants from outside the Netherlands among the population of Amsterdam was nearly 50% in the 17th and 18th centuries. Many Jews, especially from Antwerp, migrated to Amsterdam. Jews had their own laws and formed a separate society. The Netherlands also hosted religious refugees, including Huguenots from France and Puritans from England (the most famous of the latter being the Pilgrims).\n\nThe 19th century witnessed a rising conflict between Catholics, liberal Calvinists and orthodox Calvinists, and a Dutch solution, pillarization, which lasted until the 1960s.\n\nInvading forces of Revolutionary France in 1795, which established the Batavian Republic, brought equal rights for all religions in the Netherlands. In 1813, the Calvinist Republic united with the Catholic Southern Netherlands to form the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The union split in 1830 after the Belgian Revolution, which was partially motivated by religious differences between Protestants and Catholics, as well as by Orangists (royalists) and Liberals (mainly from Brussels and Ghent). The position of Catholics of the Kingdom of the Netherlands became worse again. The Catholic hierarchy became forbidden and Catholics were forbidden to hold religious processions in all provinces except for Noord Brabant and Limburg.\n\nThe Netherlands was ruled by a liberal Calvinist elite, which dominated the bureaucracy and the Dutch Reformed Church, leading to splits. In 1834, led by Rev. Hendrik de Cock, a group seceded from the Dutch Reformed Church in what was known as the \"Afscheiding\". Roughly fifty years later, in 1886, another group of orthodox Calvinists, led by Abraham Kuyper, split from the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1892, they founded the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, one of the major neo-Calvinist denominations. Kuyper also organized a whole range of religiously inspired organizations, he was inspired by his conception of the separation of Church and State, sphere sovereignty. He founded an orthodox Calvinist newspaper, labour union, schools, a university and a political party. During this period Catholics began to do the same. The Netherlands became separated between three religious pillars, an orthodox Calvinist, a Catholic and a neutral one. These were subcultures which did not interfere with each other. During the 20th century, a separate socialist pillar would also develop. This phenomenon is called pillarization. There was considerable religious tolerance between these subcultures and they cooperated with each other at the level of government.\n\nThe social distance grew. People read different newspapers; by the 1930s they listened to different radio programs. Catholic and Protestant children did not play together. Adults did not socialize across religious lines. Marriage across religious lines grew rare.\n\nJews had become fully integrated into Dutch society after 1795. Most Jews would later on become aligned within the socialist pillar; many of them became highly secularized and westernized in appearance. They formed a considerable minority: one-eighth of the population of Amsterdam was Jewish.\n\nIn 1940, the Netherlands was occupied by Nazi Germany. Most of the Dutch Jewish community was exterminated by the Nazis during this occupation.\n\nIn February 1941, there was a general strike in Amsterdam and the surrounding areas against the first razzia. This was the largest act of resistance against the persecution of Jews during the Second World War in the Netherlands. The main resistance groups were composed from conservative Calvinists, Communists and Catholics, while liberals and others were underrepresented. An important action of the resistance movement was hiding Jews from Nazis. There were 140,000 Jews in the Netherlands in 1940. 20,000 of them were free from persecution, because they were married to Aryan non-Jews, or because some of their parents and grandparents were non-Jews. Another 20,000 Jews hid from the Germans. From the 101,000 Jews that were deported, only 1,000 returned after the war. The percentage of Dutch Jews that were exterminated was much higher than in other countries, including Germany.\n\nReligion in the Netherlands was predominantly Christianity until late into the 20th century. Although religious diversity remains, there has been a decline of religious adherence. In 2006, 34 percent of the Dutch population were church members. In 2015, almost 25 percent of the population adhered to one of the Christian churches (11.7% Roman Catholic, 8.6% PKN, 4.2% other small Protestant denominations), 5 percent is Muslim and 2 percent adheres to Hinduism or Buddhism, based on independent in-depth interviewing by Radboud University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Approximately 67.8% of the population in 2015 have no religious affiliation, up from 61% in 2006, 53% in 1996, 43% 1979 and 33% in 1966. The Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau (Social and Cultural Planning Agency, SCP) expects the number of non-affiliated Dutch to be at 72% in 2020.\n\nSecularization, or the decline in religious adherence and practice, first became noticeable after 1960 in the Protestant rural towns of Friesland and Groningen. Then, it spread to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the other large cities in the west. Finally the Catholic south showed religious declines. A countervailing trend is produced by a religious revival in the Protestant Bible Belt, and the growth of Hindu and Muslim communities resulting from immigration and higher birth rates.\n\nAfter the Second World War the major religions began to decline, while a new religion, Islam, began to increase in numbers. During the 1960s and 1970s, pillarization began to weaken and the population became less religious. In 1971, 39% of the Dutch population were members of the Roman Catholic Church; by 2014, their share of the population had dropped to 23.3% (church-provided KASKI data). The proportion of adherents of mainline Protestantism declined in the same period from 31% to 10% (church-provided KASKI data). \nKASKI (Katholiek Sociaal-Kerkelijk Insituut / Catholic Social-Ecclesiastical Institute) is based on selfreported information by the Catholic and Protestant churches, which show a significantly higher number of church members than the numbers found by independent in-depth interviewing by Radboud University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. According tot KASKI, the total number of members of Christian groups in the Netherlands has decreased from approximately 7,013,163 (43.22% overall population) in 2003 to 5,730,852 (34.15% overall population) in 2013.\nAn additional 4.2% of the population adhere to other Protestant churches. With only 32.2% of the Dutch currently adhering to a religion, among which 25% adhere to Christianity and 5% to Islam, the Netherlands is one of the least religious countries of Europe.\n\nDuring the late 20th century, the Dutch policy on abortion, drug use, euthanasia, homosexuality and prostitution became very liberal. As a result of the declining religious adherence, the two major strands of Calvinism, the Dutch Reformed Church and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, together with a small Lutheran group began to cooperate, first as the \"Samen op weg Kerken\" (\"Together on the road churches\") and since 2004 as the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, a united Protestant church.\n\nDuring the same period, Islam increased from 0% to 5%. The main Islamic immigrants came from Surinam and Indonesia, as a result of decolonization, Turkey and Morocco, as migrant workers, and Iraq, Iran, Bosnia and Afghanistan as refugees. In the early 21st century, religious tensions between native Dutch people and migrant Muslims is increasing, mainly due to Islamophobia exploited by extreme Dutch politicians. After the rise of the popular politician Pim Fortuyn, who sought to defend the Dutch liberal culture against what he saw as a \"backward religion\", stricter immigration laws were enacted. Religious tensions heightened after Theo van Gogh was killed in 2004 by Mohammed Bouyeri.\n\nA December 2014 survey by the VU University Amsterdam concluded that for the first time, there were more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands. The majority of the population being agnostic (31%) or ietsistic (27%).\n\nIn the 21st century, a large majority of the Dutch population believes that religion should not play a decisive role in politics and education. Religion is also decreasingly seen as a social binder. Religion in the Netherlands is generally considered a personal matter, which is not supposed to be propagated in public.\n\nAtheism, ietsism, agnosticism, and Christian atheism keep rising; the first three being widely accepted and the last being more or less considered to be non-controversial. Among those who adhere to Christianity there are high percentages of atheists, agnostics and ietsists, since affiliation with a Christian denomination is also used in a way of cultural identification in the different parts (especially the south) of the Netherlands. \nThe expected rise of spirituality has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006, 40 percent of respondents considered themselves spiritual. In 2015, this had dropped to 31 percent.\n\n\n\n"}

Their debut album, \"Club Classics Vol. One\" (1989), which established them as a global success worldwide, earned two Grammy Awards and featured the UK and Billboard number-one singles \"Keep on Movin'\" and \"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\".\n\nFollowing the exit from the group in 1990, she released her debut solo album, \"UK Blak\" (1990), which contained hits \"Livin' in the Light\", \"UK Blak\", and \"Don't Quit\". She continued her solo career with the release of her second album, \"Beach of the War Goddess\" (1993). Wheeler reunited with Soul II Soul in 1994, but left in 1995 due to creative differences. Throughout her career, she has performed on and off with Soul II Soul but officially rejoined them in 2013.\n\nDescribed as a pioneer of the British soul scene, her musical repertoire is often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and empowerment, as well as black history. Her dynamic on-stage performances have led many critics to consider her one of the most effective singers in popular music. Throughout a career spanning 40 years, she has sold over 6 million records collectively as a solo artist and as a member of Soul II Soul. In June 2012, Wheeler was honored with the Heritage Award from Performing Right Society along with the members of Soul II Soul.\n\nWheeler was born in England to Jamaican parents, and raised briefly in Jamaica. When Caron was in high school, she and childhood friend Pauline Catlin began performing together for fun. Inspired by female groups The Shirelles and The Ronettes whom they hoped to emulate, they began performing together professionally. In 1976, Wheeler and Catlin eventually entered and won a singing competition at the Bali Hai nightclub in London. Catlin and Wheeler later added Carol Simms and the women began performing as Brown Sugar.\n\nIn 1977, Brown Sugar released their major label debut song \"I'm in Love with a Dreadlocks\". The song was a massive hit with sound system owners and reggae lovers and went on to reach the top spot in the British reggae charts. Their self-titled album was scheduled to be released in 1977, but was shelved after the group disbanded due to the mistreatment by their recording label, Lover's Rock. In 1978, Caron reunited with Brown Sugar and embarked on a tour with Dennis Brown. Following the tour, the group released a series of singles: \"Our Reggae Music\", \"Confession Hurts\", \"Dreaming of Zion\", and \"I am So Proud\" in 1979. After releasing their final single \"Go On Now\" in 1983, the group disbanded to further pursue solo careers.\n\nIn 1982, Wheeler met Claudia Fontaine, an English backing vocalist from Bethnal Green, London, England. They formed a duo known as Afrodiziak. The duo would only perform as session vocalists for other singers, most notably for Elvis Costello on his album \"Punch the Clock\" in 1983. Afrodiziak later toured as backing vocalists for Elvis Costello during his UK tour in 1983. After the tour, they became a group by adding singer Naomi Thompson. The group would go on to contribute background vocals for many artists including Heaven 17, Special AKA, Howard Jones, Japan, Aswad, Sam Brown, and Julia Fordham. Wheeler would later withdraw from the group, in 1988.\n\nIn 1988, Wheeler met Jazzie B who asked her to become one of the founding members of Soul II Soul. At the time, the group consisted of Jazzie B, Caron Wheeler, Rose Windross, Doreen Waddell, Jazzie Q, Aitch Bee, and Nellee Hooper. The group began recording their first album in 1988. The following year, the group released their debut album, Club Classics Vol. One. The album spawned the major hits \"Keep on Movin'\" and \"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\", which featured Wheeler as lead vocalist and sold over one million copies worldwide each. The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with huge sales and winning the group a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Urban Contemporary Album, Group, Band, or Duo, and two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Instrumental Performance for \"African Dance\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\".\n\nIn 1988, she sang backing vocals in the Erasure's song \"Chains of Love\".\n\nIn March 1989, Caron performed \"Keep on Movin'\" with Soul II Soul on \"Top of the Pops\". She continued to tour with the group throughout the year but left Soul II Soul to begin recording her solo album.\n\nIn early 1990, Wheeler secured a recording contract with EMI. Her first solo album \"UK Blak\" was released on May 15, 1990. The album sold 60,000 copies in the UK, debuted at number 14 the UK Albums chart, and has since sold 100 thousand copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \"Livin' in the Light\", became Caron's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US. The album also featured the singles \"UK Blak\", \"Blue (Is the Colour of Pain)\", and \"Don't Quit\", which also charted on UK Singles chart.\n\nIn 1992, Wheeler returned to the studio and began recording her second album. She also recorded her lead vocals on a song entitled \"Take Me Higher\", which was featured on Soul II Soul's album \"Volume III Just Right\". In October 1992, the album's lead single \"I Adore You\" was released with moderate success. The song was also featured on the soundtrack to the movie \"Mo' Money\" in July 1992. In February 1993, she released her second album \"Beach of the War Goddess\". Wheeler's second album also spawn the singles: \"In Our Love\", \"Soul Street\", and \"Beach of the War Goddess\".\n\nIn 1994, Wheeler was asked to rejoin Soul II Soul, for the recording of their fourth studio album \"Volume V: Believe\". The lineup now consisted of Jazzie B, Charlotte Kelly, and Penny Ford. During the recording sessions, Wheeler and Jazzie B struggled with creative differences. Wheeler felt the group should have been producing more contemporary songs and not just replicating the old sound. However, the band retained the songs she had co-written but with other vocalists recording over her lead vocals. Wheeler was supposed to appear as the lead vocalist on the album's lead single \"Love Enuff\", but she opted not to finish the song. Fellow Soul II Soul member Penny Ford sang lead vocals with Wheeler only performing background vocals on the song. Wheeler ultimately left the group before the release of the album, but her lead vocals were still present on the songs \"Ride On\" and \"Sunday\".\n\nIn 1995, Wheeler recorded \"Just the Two of Us\" as a duet with Japanese singer Toshinobu Kubota for his album \"Sunshine, Moonlight\". The song peaked at number 30 on Japan's Oricon Singles Chart. In 1996, a remix of \"Keep On Movin'\" was released and charted at number 31 on the UK Singles chart.\n\nIn 1997, Wheeler provided guest vocals on the song \"You're Mine\" for Eric Gadd's album \"The Right Way\". In 1999, Wheeler released a single \"Star\", which peaked at number 82 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs' chart. In 2001, Wheeler recorded the song \"Open\" with Pete Rock on the American hip hop production team Da Beatminerz's album \"Brace 4 Impak\". In 2002, Wheeler was featured on Meshell Ndegeocello's \"\".\n\nIn 2003, she performed the track \"Another Star\" to the Stevie Wonder tribute album \"Conception - An Interpretation of Stevie Wonder's Songs\". She was featured on the song \"Lonely\" for Richard X's album, \"Richard X Presents His X-Factor Vol. 1\".\n\nIn 2006, Wheeler released her live album \"Live at Duo Music Exchange\". The album was recorded in Japan and features live performances of her songs as well as songs Wheeler recorded during her time with Soul II Soul.\n\nIn 2007, Wheeler reunited with Soul II Soul, at the time consisting of Jazzie B, Aitch Bee, and MC Chickaboo. The group began performing at local nightclubs and music festivals. In February 2009, Wheeler toured with the group in Australia where they performed at the Playground Weekender Festival. In July 2009, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lovers Rock Gala Awards.\n\nIn 2010, Soul II Soul reunited for a reunion tour with the lineup consisting of: Jazzie B, Caron Wheeler, Rose Windross, Kym Mazelle, Charlotte Kelly, Aitch B, and MC Chickaboo. Following the conclusion of tour, Wheeler briefly departed from the group. In June 2012, Wheeler was present with the members of Soul II Soul when they received the honorary from PRS Heritage Plaque Award. She also performed with the group during the ceremony.\n\nIn 2013, Wheeler officially returned to Soul II Soul and began touring again with the group as the lead vocalist. During her interview with Jools Holland, Wheeler stated that she will be recording new music with Soul II Soul.\n\nIn 2016, Soul II Soul released a single \"A New Day\", featuring Louie Vega, which is credited to Caron Wheeler and Jazzie B. In November 2016, the group released a live album titled \"Origins: The Roots of Soul II Soul\". In 2017, Wheeler made an appearance on her former Soul II Soul colleague Simon Law's album \"Look to the Sky\" on the lead single \"Morning Love\".\n\nIn 2004, Wheeler gave birth to her daughter Asha Star.\n\n\n|rowspan=\"2\"| \n|rowspan=\"1\"|1990\n\n|rowspan=\"2\"| \n\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1991\n\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1990 \n\n\n\n"}

It is the fifth verse of the Sermon on the Mount, and also the fifth of what are known as the Beatitudes.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible, the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub: Matthew 5:7.\n\nLike this verse has no parallel in Luke's Sermon on the Plain. New Testament scholar Robert H. Gundry therefore suggests that this fairly straightforward construction was probably thus a creation by the author of Matthew's Gospel. The theme is an obvious one for Matthew to choose: Eduard Schweizer notes that \"mercy is the focal point of Matthew's message\".\n\nThe form – \"blessed\" (Greek: ') + subject + \"that\" (') + cause – can be found in (also in Tobit 13:16), whereas the eschatological orientation is similar to (also 1 Enoch 58:2–3). Other ancient literature can attest the grouping together of several beautitudes (cf. 4Q525 2; 2 Enoch 52:1–14) and the use of third person plural address (cf. Pss. Sol. 17:44; Tobit 13:14). The Greek word \"makarios\" cannot adequately be rendered as \"blessed\" nor \"happy\", as it is rather 'a term of congratulation and recommendation' which can also mean \"satisfied\" (as in ).\n\nThe Greek phrase , \" \", \"the merciful\" or \"the compassionate\" (; Homer, Odyssey, Book 5, line 191) does not merely refer to the 'negative quality' (\"not dealing harshly, not inflicting punishment when due, sparing an animal or a fellow-man some unnecessary labor\"), but also 'active kindness to the destitute and to any who are in trouble' (cf. ; ; ; ).\n\nThis verse, according to Gundry, marks the beginning of the second quartet of Beatitudes. The first four are all about private attitudes and conditions, the second four are about relations between people. Gundry feels the first four reflect the persecuted conditions of the disciples and the second four show the righteous behaviour that led to this persecution.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179764", "title": "West Coast, Tasmania", "text": "West Coast, Tasmania\n\nThe West Coast of Tasmania is mainly isolated rough country, associated with wilderness, mining and tourism. It served as the location of an early convict settlement in the early history of Van Diemen's Land, and contrasts sharply with the more developed and populous northern and eastern parts of the island state.\n\nThe west coast has a much cooler and wetter climate when compared to the east coast. Frequent low pressure systems hit the west coast causing heavy rain, snow, and ice. The West Coast Range blocks these systems from impacting the east, therefore making the West Coast a rain catchment with some areas receiving over of rain a year. In winter temperatures at sea level hover around , and when not raining, morning frost is common. The temperatures are much lower inland from the coast with maximums in winter often failing to surpass . Typically, the snow line in winter is around 900 metres (3000 ft), however sea level snow falls several times each winter as well. Summer is mild with maximum temperatures averaging between and , though some days still fail to reach . Despite snowfall usually occurring in winter, it has been known to fall in the middle of summer.\n\nMany outsiders have had difficulty understanding the isolation of the west coast, and the small communities, and the historical context to that isolation. Initially the only way in and out was by sea, and no serviceable roads to either the north or east existed until the 1930s (east) or the 1960s (north). Railways were the main land connection from the 1920s to the 1960s - though that connection was with the north coast, rather than the more populous southeast.\n\nThe treacherous conditions at Hell's Gates at the mouth of Macquarie Harbour, and ocean travel along the exposed western side of Tasmania have made marine travel a dangerous pastime even to the current day, despite modern technology. Memorial plaques to recent lost sailors on the wall at the northern edge of the Strahan wharf illustrate this.\n\nThe current airstrip is at Strahan, with the airstrip at Queenstown no longer a current registered landing ground. In the 1970s a regular service to the east coast was run by Airlines of Tasmania.\n\nAll transport services to the west coast are subject to interruption by severe weather. In addition to closures of air and marine service, the roads to the west coast may be blocked for days at a time by ice and snow during severe winter conditions.\nThe consequence of the isolation, and the ways that the communities coped with the difficulties, were little examined prior to the 1990s, except for parts of Tim Bowden's 1979 Radio Documentary \"\"The West Coasters\"\", and various references in Geoffrey Blainey's \"\"The Peaks of Lyell\"\" book and the important works of C.J. Binks and Kerry Pink.\n\nSince the rise of tourism on the west coast, the Franklin Dam issue and the creation of the world heritage wilderness area, a steady number of small publications concerning the history and features of the region have been produced.\n\nFor a brief time in the early 20th century the west coast had population and political power on a parity with Hobart and Launceston. Following the demise of most of the Zeehan mines, the west coast population has either remained static, or declined relative to other parts of the island.\n\nThe environment is described with particular historical understanding by C.J. Binks in \"\"Explorers of Western Tasmania\"\" Chapter 2 - \"A Sketch of the Western Country\". See also West Coast Range\n\nThe convict era is introduced in articles about Macquarie Harbour Penal Station, Convicts on the West Coast of Tasmania, and Hell's Gates.\n\nThe reliance on the railways can be found in the separate article West Coast Tasmania Railways.\n\nThe mining history was captured first in Charles Whitham's Western Tasmania book - and Geoffrey Blainey's Peaks of Lyell and the books that have followed. See also the list at West Coast Tasmania Mines for a list that includes historical names and locations - many now long abandoned.\n\nThe vast tracts of forest (Huon Pine, among others) in the west coast region have been subject to fire, and exploitation - as well as significant areas now under conservation. The history of the West Coast Piners who utilised the Franklin River and Gordon River and their tributaries is a vital part of west coast history.\n\nThe legacy of the Hydro Electric Commission (The Hydro) on the west coast is a complex one, due to its sense in the 1940s to 1980s considering the west and south west regions as its 'last frontier' for the remaining catchments for its power development schemes.\n\nAs most of the European activity on the west coast (after the convict era) lies within the invention and use of the camera, most aspects of west coast history have been captured on film.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, and the State Library of Tasmania in Hobart are the main holdings of the record, while the late Eric Thomas's collection in the 'Galley Museum' in Queenstown is on a par with both.\n\nSome examples of collections: -\n\nDue to the rise of tourism in the 1990s - a considerable number of DVDs and videos are commercially available of the region - going into areas which had been inaccessible as recently as 30 or 40 years ago. Also tourists and hikers have gathered a considerable record of the region which regularly appears in either their own or generally accessible websites on the internet.\n\nThe Tasmanian West bioregion comprises the West Coast region and the South West region.\n\n\n\n"}

She occasionally writes under the pen name 'Hu Meili' (). Lung's poignant and critical essays contributed to the democratization of Taiwan and as the only Taiwanese writer with a column in major mainland Chinese newspapers, she is an influential writer in Mainland China. She has written 17 books.\n\nLung Ying-tai has held two positions within Taiwan's government as Taipei's first Cultural Bureau Chief (1999–2003) and as Taiwan's first Culture Minister (2012–2014).\n\nLung's father, Lung Huai-sheng (), a Kuomintang military police officer, moved his family to Taiwan after the KMT lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949. She is her parents' second child and has four brothers. The first character of Lung's given name, \"ying\" (), is her mother's family name ( Ying Mei-jun), and the second character, \"tai\" (), is to signify that she is the first child in the family to be born in Taiwan.\n\nAfter attending National Tainan Girls' Senior High School, Lung received her bachelor's degree in Foreign Language and Literature from the National Cheng Kung University and a PhD from Kansas State University in English and American Literature.\n\nAfter returning to Taiwan, she began writing an op-ed column in \"China Times\" on the various conditions in Taiwan. Her essays were published together in 1985 in a book of social-political criticism, \"The Wild Fire,\" (\"Ye Huo Ji\" ) when Taiwan was still under the Kuomintang's one-party rule, which cemented her role as an intellectual in Taiwan. She moved to Germany in 1987, partly due to the response to her work that included death threats. Her translated essays had appeared in European newspapers such as the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\". Her work has appeared in mainland Chinese newspapers since the early 1990s. Her essays include \"Children Take Your Time,\" \"Silver Cactus\", \"Rise of thinking,\" and in 2006, \"Please Use Civilization to Convince Me\", an open letter to Hu Jintao following the temporary closure of \"Freezing Point\". She criticised Singaporean minister Lee Kuan Yew and the government's restrictions on personal freedom in 1994 in an article titled, \"Thank God I Am Not Singaporean\".\n\nShe returned to Taiwan to become the first Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau of Taipei in September 1999, and her policies increased the visibility of the arts in Taipei during her four-year term. She resigned in March 2003 to return to writing, noting that \"being an official is suffocating. I could hardly breathe.\"\n\nShe joined the Journalism and Media Studies Centre of the University of Hong Kong in August 2004. In July 2005, she established the Lung Ying-tai Cultural Foundation and used the foundation as a platform to sponsor literary and artistic endeavours as well as academic lectures. In 2007, Lung was offered a position on the seat on the Control Yuan which she refused. Since 2008 Lung Ying-tai has undertaken the position of Hung Leung Hao Ling Distinguished Fellow in Humanities of University of Hong Kong and Chair Professor of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. She received the 2009 K.T. Li Chair Professor Award from NCKU.\n\nHer 2009 book \"Da Jiang Da Hai 1949\" (\"Big River, Big Sea\") is about the 1949 civil war and the escape to Taiwan of supporters of the Kuomintang. It sold over 100,000 copies in Taiwan and 10,000 in Hong Kong in its first month of release, but discussion of her work was banned in mainland China following the book launch.\n\nIn 2009, her book \"Watching You Go\" (\"Musong 目送\") was published, becoming popular across Asia. The book is a collection of 74 works of prose narrating hardships and obstacles Lung has encountered, particularly in relation to her family.\n\nUpon the creation of the Ministry of Culture in May 2012 she became the first Minister of Culture of Taiwan.\n\nLung was inaugurated as Minister of Culture on 21 May 2012, stating a desire that the ministry be independent of political influence. During her 2-year, 7-month tenure, she made statements or announced initiatives on reading, TV culture, and cross-strait exchanges. On 1 December 2014, Lung tendered her resignation from the ministerial post citing her aging mother as the main reason, with political and media hostility as contributing factors.\n\nAfter moving to Germany in the late 1980s, she married a German man with whom she has two sons. She was also known as Ying-tai Walther. They were eventually divorced. One of Lung's books, \"Dear Andreas\" (), is a collection of letters and e-mails between her and her older son.\n\n"}

It is located at the corner of 5 Simmonds Street and 78 Fox Street in the Central Business District of the city. Construction of the building started in 1968 and was completed in 1968. It is tall. It was also home to Standard Bank, until the company moved to other site in 1990.\n\nThe building was built from the top-down, meaning that after the central core was built, the floors were suspended from cantilevered arms with the top floors added first, followed by each lower floor.\n\nThe challenge for the designers - the German architect Helmut Hentrich (1905-2001) and the Austrian architect Hubert Petschnigg (1913-1997), who planned the skyscraper in collaboration with the British-Danish-Norwegian engineer Ove Arup (1895-1988) - was to find a spacious square in the crowded Johannesburg CBD to anchor an office building. To keep space used to a minimum, they adopted the \"hanging\" design.\n\nApart from the concrete core tower, the Standard Bank Centre was built by Concor of precast reinforced concrete slabs, glass, and steel. The plastic molds in which the concrete slabs were cast gave them a distinctive shape. The steel girders used for the balustrades are 1.5 m high and 24.6 m long. A special slewing crane was designed for the project to lift and mount a quarter of each floor level. Concrete was delivered by night to the construction site to minimize traffic obstruction.\n\nThe office building stretches to 39 stories, of which five are underground. The lower two stories house the computer center, including the evaluation center with a staff of 300. The bank room offers access to the safe tower stretching through all the lower floors, with delivery access through the lower parking lot. The windows use tinted glass with laminated double glazing for sunlight protection. No special arrangements need to be made for window cleaning, since the 60-cm balustrades make cleaning the outer pane easy. Air vents are located in the corners of the facade. The office is 9.7 m wide. The hanging design eliminates the need for pillars.\n"}
{"id": "2179779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179779", "title": "Memorialism", "text": "Memorialism\n\nMemorialism is the belief held by some Christian denominations that the elements of bread and wine (or juice) in the Eucharist (more often referred to as The Lord's Supper by memorialists) are purely symbolic representations of the body and blood of Jesus, the feast being established only or primarily as a commemorative ceremony. The term comes from : \"This do in memory of me\" and the attendant interpretation that the Lord's Supper's chief purpose is to help the participant \"remember\" Jesus and his sacrifice on the Cross.\n\nThis viewpoint is commonly held by General Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, segments of the Restoration Movement (such as Jehovah's Witnesses), and some non-denominational Churches, as well as those identifying with liberal Christianity; it is rejected by other branches of Christianity, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Church of the East, the Methodist Churches, the Independent Catholic Churches, and the Reformed Churches (inclusive of the Continental Reformed, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist traditions), all of which variously affirm the doctrine of the real presence.\n\nThe theology of Huldrych Zwingli, a Protestant Reformer of Switzerland, is commonly associated with memorialism. Zwingli, who was a former Roman Catholic priest, affirmed that Christ is truly (though not naturally) present to the believer in the sacrament or amid a Christian congregation that remembers with strong intensity the events of the Last Supper through the power of God. However, the sacrament - for Zwingli - is not used instrumentally to communicate with Christ, as John Calvin taught. \n\nZwingli argued that the Eucharist is more about the presence of Christ in the minds of people instead of his presence in the elements. This indicates that, although its liturgies remain an important aspect of being a Christian, its potential benefits are not found in any metaphysical interpretation related to the bread and wine used in the ritual. \n\nIn addition, unlike the Lutheran theory, Zwingli maintained that the Scripture and the creeds support the idea that Christ sits at the right hand of the Father in heaven.\n"}

It was the only film to be shot in the widescreen Cinemiracle process, which came with a seven-track stereophonic soundtrack.\n\nThe \"Christian Radich\" and its Norwegian crew were filmed while sailing from Oslo, via the island of Madeira, across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, to New York City, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and then back home to Bergen in Norway.\n\nThe film features a score by Morton Gould, with additional musical performances by cellist Pablo Casals and Arthur Fiedler conducting the Boston Pops Orchestra.\n\nA musical highlight through the film is the Piano Concerto of Edvard Grieg, which accompanies the voyage narrative about one of the sea-cadets who is a piano-student preparing to play the concerto in Boston.\n\nThe film also features a meeting with the German ship \"Pamir\", which sank in a hurricane in September 1957.\n\nThe world premiere was at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Hollywood on April 8, 1958 where the movie ran for 36 weeks. The East Coast premiere took place at New York's Roxy Theatre on April 9 where it was shown for 22 weeks on a special curved screen 100 by in size. The film was also exhibited at specially equipped cinemas in America, Canada, and Europe. Later it was shown in wide release in Cinerama theaters worldwide. It was particularly popular in the Scandinavian nations and in its 29-week run in Oslo had more paid admissions (401,320) than the city's population at the time (375,000).\n\nThe film begins in non-widescreen format (1.33: 1 aspect ratio) as the crew prepares for the voyage. When the ship finally sets out (about fifteen minutes into the picture), the screen expands to Cinemiracle dimensions, virtually the same as those of Cinerama.\n\n\n\n"}

He was brought up by his grandfather and studied at St. Hippolyte. His uncle and guardian, the Marquis of Florian, who had married a niece of Voltaire, introduced him at the château de Ferney and in 1768 he became page at Anet in the household of the Duc de Penthièvre, who remained his friend throughout his life. Having studied for some time at the artillery school at Bapaume he obtained from his patron a captain's commission in the dragoon regiment of Penthièvre.\n\nHe left the army soon after and began to write comedies, and was elected to the Académie française in 1788. On the outbreak of the French Revolution he retired to Sceaux, but he was soon discovered and imprisoned; and though Robespierre's death spared him, he died a few months later still in prison. The cause of death was tuberculosis.\n\nTo modern readers, Florian is chiefly known as the author of pretty fables well suited as reading for the young, but his contemporaries praised him also for his poetical and pastoral novels. Florian was very fond of Spain and its literature, doubtless owing to the influence of his Castilian mother, and both abridged and imitated the works of Cervantes.\n\nFlorian's first literary efforts were comedies; his verse epistle \"Voltaire et le serf du Mont Jura\" and an eclogue \"Ruth\" were crowned by the Académie française in 1782 and 1784 respectively. In 1782 also he produced a one-act prose comedy, \"Le Bon Ménage\", and in the next year \"Galatie\", a romantic tale in imitation of the \"Galatea\" of Cervantes. Other short tales and comedies followed, and in 1786 appeared \"Numa Pompilius\", an undisguised imitation of Fénelon's \"Telémaque\".\n\nIn 1788 he became a member of the Académie française, and published \"Estelle\", a pastoral of the same class as \"Galatie\". Another romance, \"Gonzalve de Cordoue\", preceded by an historical notice of the Moors, appeared in 1791, and his famous collection of \"Fables\" in 1802. Among his posthumous works are \"La Jeunesse de Florian, ou Mémoires d'un Jeune Espagnol\" (1807), and an abridgment (1809) of \"Don Quixote\", which, though far from being a correct representation of the original, had great and merited success.\n\nFlorian imitated Salomon Gessner, the Swiss idyllist, and his style has all the artificial delicacy and sentimentality of the Gessnerian school. Perhaps the nearest example of the class in English literature is afforded by John Wilson's \"Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life\" (written as Christopher North). Among the best of his fables are reckoned \"The Monkey showing the Magic Lantern\", \"The Blind Man and the Paralytic\", and \"The Monkeys and the Leopard\".\n\n\nFlorian wrote a collection of fables. From these fables several expressions have passed into colloquial French:\n\nThe expression \"éclairer la lanterne\" (\"light the lantern\") is also drawn from Florian's fables.\n\nHis most famous verse is Plaisir d'amour, a poem he put in his story Celestine. The verse became a song which has survived to the 21st century.\n\nBlason: Or an eagle sable on a chief azure a sun or (the coat of arms of his birthplace of Florian) to which the eagle looks (for difference).\n\n\n\n"}

His mother Rosalind was a cousin of the Conservative politician Robert Boothby, later Lord Boothby. He had two younger sisters, Morar and Katherine. Morar married the playwright Royce Ryton in 1954. Katherine married Major Ion Calvocoressi in 1947.\n\nHe was schooled at Eton College (where he played in a jazz band with Humphrey Lyttelton), and \nstudied for a year at Christ Church, Oxford, until the outbreak of war. While at Oxford he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club.\n\nKennedy's father, by then a 60-year-old retired captain, returned to the navy and was given command of HMS \"Rawalpindi\", a hastily militarised P&O steamship, known as an Armed Merchant Cruiser. On 23 November 1939, while on patrol southeast of Iceland the \"Rawalpindi\" encountered two of the most powerful German warships, the small battleships (or battlecruisers) and trying to break out through the GIUK gap into the Atlantic. The \"Rawalpindi\" was able to signal the German ships' location back to base. Despite being hopelessly outgunned, Captain Edward Coverley Kennedy of the \"Rawalpindi\" decided to fight, rather than surrender as demanded by the Germans. \"Scharnhorst\" sank \"Rawalpindi\"; of her 312 crew 275 (including her captain) were killed. Captain Kennedy was posthumously mentioned in dispatches and his decision to fight against overwhelming odds entered the folklore of the Royal Navy. His son Ludovic was 20 years old.\n\nLudovic Kennedy followed his father into the Royal Navy; he served as an officer on destroyers, mostly in the same northern seas. His ship, HMS \"Tartar\", was one of those that pursued the battleship \"Bismarck\" following the Battle of the Denmark Strait. He witnessed the final battle, until \"Bismarck\" was ablaze and its crew began to abandon ship, but shortage of fuel forced \"Tartar\" to depart for home before \"Bismarck\" sank. Kennedy later wrote about this in his 1974 book \"Pursuit\", his chronicle of the chase and sinking of the \"Bismarck\".\n\nHaving studied for one year at Christ Church, Oxford, before the war, he returned to complete his studies in 1945. At Oxford he helped found the Writers' Club and then sought a means of support while he completed a book on Nelson's captains. After leaving Oxford he began a career as an investigative journalist.\n\nA campaigning, investigative reporter, Kennedy wrote for a number of publications, including \"Newsweek\". From 1953, he edited and introduced the \"First Reading\" radio series on the BBC Third Programme, presenting young writers such as Kingsley Amis and Philip Larkin. Later he became a television journalist and a newsreader on ITV's Independent Television News alongside Robin Day and Chris Chataway. He presented the BBC's flagship current affairs programme \"Panorama\" for several years. Kennedy was interested in miscarriages of justice, and he wrote and broadcast on numerous cases.\n\nA major interest of Kennedy's was naval warfare. He wrote and presented a substantial number of television documentaries for the BBC on maritime history in the Second World War, beginning with Scapa Flow, followed by the dramatic narrative of the sinking of the Bismarck in which he was personally involved. Other subjects included the U-Boat war, the story of HMS Belfast, and the raids on Dieppe and St. Nazaire. \"The Life and Death of the Scharnhorst\" (1971) brought him into contact with survivors of the battlecruiser that had sunk his father's ship . The series included \"Target Tirpitz\" (1973), a history of the extraordinary attempts to sink the feared German battleship. Two of these films led to subsequent books.\n\nIn 1980 he presented an episode of the BBC television series Great Railway Journeys of the World, in which he crossed the United States.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1988 he presented the television review programme \"Did You See...?\" He interviewed Peter Cook's character Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling in \"A Life in Pieces\" in 1990. He appeared as himself in several episodes on the political comedy series \"Yes Minister\". Kennedy was the subject of an episode of \"That Reminds Me\" (2002: season 4, episode 1).\nKennedy also expressed to another journalist that there are too many Blacks on television.\n\n\"Private Eye\" magazine sometimes referred to him as 'Ludicrous Kennedy'. In the long-running BBC sitcom \"Till Death Us Do Part\", Alf Garnett – while attacking BBC personalities – spoke of him as a \"Russian Mick\" (\"\"Mick\"\" being an offensive term for an Irishman), meaning \"that \"Ludovich Kennedy!\"\"\n\nKennedy's book \"Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the \"Bismarck\"\" () detailed the career of the \"Bismarck\", her sinking of British battlecruiser \"Hood\", and her destruction by the Royal Navy.\n\nHe wrote several books that questioned convictions in a number of notable cases in British criminal history. One of the first miscarriages of justice he investigated was the conviction and hanging of Timothy Evans in his 1961 book \"Ten Rillington Place\" (). Evans was found to have murdered his baby daughter in 1950, but Kennedy contended that he was innocent, and that the murders of his wife and baby had been committed by the serial killer John Christie. Christie was hanged three years after the hanging of Evans, following the discovery of six more bodies at 10 Rillington Place, none of which could be ascribed to Evans. Indeed, two of the skeletons found at the house dated back to the war – long before Evans and his family had moved in. After a long campaign, Evans was pardoned in 1966. The scandal helped in the abolition of the death penalty in the UK. Kennedy's book was filmed in 1970 as \"10 Rillington Place\", starring John Hurt as Evans and Richard Attenborough as Christie.\n\nIn 1985, Kennedy published \"The Airman and the Carpenter\" (), in which he argued that Richard Hauptmann did not kidnap and murder Charles Lindbergh's baby, a crime for which he was executed in 1936. The book was made into a 1996 HBO film \"Crime of the Century\", starring Stephen Rea and Isabella Rossellini.\n\nIn 1990, Kennedy became the advisory committee chairman of \"Just Television\", a television production company dedicated to exposing miscarriages of justice.\n\nIn 2003, he wrote \"36 Murders and 2 Immoral Earnings\" (), in which he analysed a number of noted cases, including the Evans case and those of Derek Bentley and the Birmingham Six, a number of which were affected by claims of police failure, police misconduct or perjury. In it he concluded that the adversarial system of justice in the UK and the United States \"is an invitation to the police to commit perjury, which they frequently do\", and said that he preferred the inquisitorial system.\n\nKennedy also wrote:\n\nIn 1958, Kennedy stood for election to Parliament as the Liberal candidate in the Rochdale by-election called after the death of the sitting Conservative MP, Wentworth Schofield in December 1957. He lost to the Labour candidate, Jack McCann, but achieved an increase in the Liberal vote, pushing the Conservatives into third place. The Rochdale contest was the first British by-election to receive live television coverage (locally, by Granada Television).\n\nHe stood for Rochdale at the 1959 general election, with a vote share increased from the by-election, but again came second to Labour.\n\nIn addition to his writing and campaigning on miscarriages of justice, Kennedy campaigned on a number of other issues.\n\nA lifelong atheist, he published \"All in the Mind: A Farewell To God\" in 1999, in which he discussed his philosophical objections to religion, and the ills he felt had come from Christianity. He was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association, he contributed to \"New Humanist\" magazine, he was an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of the Humanist Society Scotland.\n\nHe was also an advocate of the legalisation of assisted suicide, and was a co-founder and former chair of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. His book, \"Euthanasia: The Case for the Good Death\", was published in 1990.\n\nKennedy resigned from the Liberal Democrats in 2001, citing the incompatibility of his pro-voluntary euthanasia views with those of the then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy (no relation), who was a Roman Catholic.\n\nHe then stood as an independent on a platform of legalising voluntary euthanasia in the 2001 general election for the Wiltshire constituency of Devizes. He won 2 per cent of the vote and subsequently rejoined the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn February 1950 he married the dancer and actress Moira Shearer in the Chapel Royal, Hampton Court Palace. He later remembered their meeting in 1949, when he was reluctantly persuaded by a friend to accept a complimentary ticket to a fancy dress ball held at the Lyceum ballroom in London. Shearer – who had recently become famous for her role in \"The Red Shoes\" – was presenting the prizes at the occasion, and Kennedy later recalled that \"I felt a tremor run through me when I caught sight of her. She looked even lovelier than in the film.\"\n\nSummoning up his courage, he approached the 23-year-old dancer and asked her to dance. She would be delighted, she told him, only \"I don't dance very well.\" She was not, Kennedy revealed, a competent ballroom dancer. The couple had one son and three daughters (Alastair, Ailsa, Rachel and Fiona) from a 56-year marriage that ended with her death on 31 January 2006 at the age of 80.\n\nHe received an honorary doctorate from the University of Strathclyde in 1985.\n\nHe was knighted in 1994 for services to journalism, on the recommendation of John Major's government. Major's predecessor Margaret Thatcher had vetoed Kennedy's knighthood.\n\nKennedy died of pneumonia in a nursing home in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 18 October 2009, aged 89.\n\n"}

In 1987, Eddie came out with other house tracks such as \"The Whop\", based on the dance of the same name. Eddie then left WGCI for WBMX for a short time and then quit his radio DJ gigs to concentrate on producing. In 1988, Eddie scored one of his biggest hits with \"Acid Thunder\" on the DJ International label. However, it was the track \"Hip House\" that really established his career as a producer.

The name \"An t-Aodann Bàn\" is said to be taken from the white bog cotton plants that can be found on the hill sides. The village is based around the crofts with a small primary school and pottery. Notable buildings in Edinbane village are the former Gesto Hospital (c. 1870), the Edinbane Inn (c. 1900) and Edinbane Lodge, a stone-built hunting lodge built in 1543.\n\nThere has been a settlement here since before 1600, but it was Kenneth MacLeod of Greshornish (1 December 1809, died unmarried in 1869) who founded the village.\n\nKenneth McLeod's family had farmed land in the Gesto area of Skye for over 500 years. At the age of 15 he went to India, with his fare paid out and one golden guinea in his pocket, given him by Mrs MacDonald of Waternish. After a year's work, he took the river boat down to Calcutta. On the way he went ashore and visited a place where an auction of the contents of a sugar factory was in progress. With his precious Guinea, he bought a copper boiler, which he sold in Calcutta for £30. He now returned to the derelict sugar factory and bought it for very little. This set him on the ladder to making a fortune in India planting indigo. \n\nReturning to Skye, he endeavoured to buy the tack of Gesto but MacLeod of MacLeod was not prepared to sell. Kenneth then bought Orbost, Isle of Skye, Edinbane, Skirinish, Greshornishy, Tote and Skeabost and much of Portree. He ensured that the village had a tradesman from each of the important crafts. He set up the first hospital on Skye in Edinbane, aptly named Gesto. It is now boarded up.\n\nEdinbane Lodge is the oldest coaching inn on the Isle of Skye, dating from 1543. Originally known as Tigh A Linne it operated as one of three change houses for travellers on their way between Portree and Dunvegan. It was purchased by Kenneth MacLeod of Greshornish in the 1860s and converted into a hunting lodge. In 1920 the Lodge was purchased by Edward Langdale Hilleary, a wealthy London businessman, and his wife Edith (née Robertson), niece of Kenneth MacLeod. In 1927 Edward Langdale Hilleary constructed a small hydro plant on the Abhainn Coishletter just behind the Lodge. The scheme supplied electricity to the nearby Gesto hospital and also powered the Lodge. Among other uses, Edinbane Lodge has served as the land court for the surrounding area, where people were tried for various offences including sheep rustling and more serious crimes.

It is the sixth verse of the Sermon on the Mount, and also sixth of what are known as the Beatitudes.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:8.\n\nThis verse is generally believed to have been taken from either by Jesus or the author of Matthew who was adding this verse that is not found in Luke. A number of scholars have been certain that there were originally seven Beatitudes, as seven was a holy number. Since this verse is so similar to the Psalm some believe it was the one incorrectly integrated into the Sermon on the Mount. Hill speculates that the verse could actually be a mistranslation of , and should have read \"only the contrite will see God.\"\n\nThe form – \"blessed\" (Greek: ') + subject + \"that\" (') + cause – can be found in (also in Tobit 13:16), whereas the eschatological orientation is similar to (also 1 Enoch 58:2–3). Other ancient literature can attest the grouping together of several beautitudes (cf. 4Q525 2; 2 Enoch 52:1–14) and the use of third person plural address (cf. Pss. Sol. 17:44; Tobit 13:14). The Greek word \"makarios\" cannot adequately be rendered as \"blessed\" nor \"happy\", as it is rather 'a term of congratulation and recommendation', that can also mean \"satisfied\" (as in ).\n\nThe word purity is not believed to refer to one who was ritually cleansed, but rather to internal spiritual purity as noted by the \"in heart\" addition. At the time the heart was literally seen as the seat of emotion and the soul, though today the verse is read metaphorically. Davies and Allison read a pure heart as being one that is simple and undivided in allegiance.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1858, he was adopted by Emperor Ninkō as a potential heir to the throne. As he was born when the country was still under rule by the Tokugawa Bakufu, he was sent into the Buddhist priesthood, and assigned to serve at the \"monzeki\" temple of Ninna-ji in Kyoto, where he adopted the title \"Ninnaji-no-miya Yoshiaki\" (仁和寺宮嘉彰). \nHe returned to secular life in 1867 during the Meiji Restoration, and led imperial forces to Osaka, Yamato, Shikoku and Aizu during the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate.\n\nPrince Yoshiaki married Arima Yoriko (June 18, 1852 – June 26, 1914), daughter of Arima Yorishige, the former \"daimyō\" of Kurume Domain, on November 6, 1869. In 1870, Emperor Meiji assigned him the title of Higashifushimi-no-miya.\n\nPrince Yoshiaki studied military tactics in England for two years from 1870-1872.\n\nConsidered a brilliant military tactician, he helped subdue many of the \"samurai\" rebellions in the early years of the Meiji period, including the Saga Rebellion of 1874, and the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. The emperor granted him the rank of lieutenant general in the newly created Imperial Japanese Army and awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class).\n\nIn 1882, he changed the name of his house to Komatsu-no-miya and his personal name from \"Yoshiaki\" to \"Akihito\", and became therefore known as \"Prince Komatsu-no-miya Akihito\".\n\nPrince Komatsu rose to the rank of general and received command of the First Imperial Guard Division in 1890. He was nominal commander of the Japanese expeditionary forces in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and became a member of the Supreme Military Council. Following the death of his uncle, Prince Arisugawa Taruhito in 1895, Prince Komatsu Akihito became the chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, and received the honorary rank of field marshal.\n\nPrince Komatsu Akihito also served the Meiji government in a diplomatic capacity. In 1886, he went to England, France, Germany and Russia on behalf of Emperor Meiji.\n\nHe was sent to Istanbul in 1887 to mark the inaugural step in relations between Ottoman Empire and the Empire of Japan. Prince Komatsu was received in an audience by the Ottoman Emperor ‘Abdu’l-Hamid II.\n\nIn June 1902, Prince Komatsu Akihito returned to the United Kingdom to represent Emperor Meiji at the coronation ceremonies for King Edward VII, and also visited France, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Russia.\n\nIn his latter years, Prince Komatsu was a patron of the Japanese Red Cross Society and the \"Dai Nippon Butoku Kai\", along with other charity institutions. As Prince Komatsu died without heirs, the title of Komatsu-no-miya reverted to his younger brother, Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito. However, to preserve the Komatsu family name, in 1910 the fourth son of Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa was renamed Teruhisa Komatsu, with the peerage title of marquis (\"koshaku\").\n\n\n"}

The Park lends its name to the Grange Park neighbourhood in the vicinity of the park. Historically, the park was the backyard of The Grange, a manor that eventually was expanded and became the Art Gallery of Ontario.\n\nAfter a major renovation completed by July 2017, the park includes the following features:\n\nThere are a few prominently visible buildings along the borders of the park that act as a backdrop. These include:\n\nGrange Park was originally the front lawn and garden of the Grange, a manor house built in 1820 by the Boulton family, an influential family in 19th century Toronto. In 1910, Harriet Boulton (also known as Mrs. Goldwin Smith) bequeathed her estate to the Art Museum of Toronto (later the Art Gallery of Ontario) which included the Grange, and the surrounding property. On January 20, 1911, the Art Museum of Toronto reached an agreement with the City of Toronto, where the city would maintain the grounds south of The Grange as a municipal public park. The agreement continues to be in force, with the art museum remaining as the property's owner, and the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division maintains the grounds as a municipal park.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Grange Park was expanded to its present-day size by closing portions of two streets: Grange Road from Beverley Street to John Street, and John Street between Grange Road to Stephanie Street.\n\nIn 2008, the Grange Park Advisory Committee (GPAC) was formed to join local residents, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the City of Toronto, and neighbouring organizations to start the Grange Park Revitalization Project with the goal of renovating Grange Park and restoring it to its natural beauty. By 2009, GPAC produced a design brief. GPAC is a 15-person Committee whose role is to advise on the restoration and revitalization of Grange Park and on an oversight structure for the ongoing maintenance and program for Grange Park. By that time, Grange Park had deteriorated because of restrictions in City funding resulting in uneven pathways, dilapidated benches and playground equipment, many areas of bare ground and poorly maintained trees.\n\nOn July 10, 2017, after a cost of $15 million and 15 months of construction, a renovated Grange Park officially reopened with many improvements such as expansion of the children's play area, 80 news trees, expanded lawn area, an off-leash dog area, new public washrooms, new water features and new seating areas. As part of the renovation, the Henry Moore sculpture \"Large Two Formspark\" was moved from the corner of Dundas and McCaul streets to become the centrepiece of the park. The park was designed by PFS Studio with Thinc Design as executive architects. The AGO, the City of Toronto, the Weston Family, and various community groups jointly fininanced the renovation. There is also an endowment fund to support the park's long-term maintenance.\n\nIn February 2017, the Grange Community Association requested that the portion of John Street from Queen street West to Stephanie Street be given the ceremonial name of \"Harriet Boulton Smith Way\" in honour of the person who bequeathed the Grange estate to become Grange Park and the Art Gallery of Ontario. That portion of John Street was once part of the Grange estate.\n\n"}

Plate spinning relies on the gyroscopic effect, in the same way a top stays upright while spinning. Spinning plates are sometimes gimmicked, to help keep the plates on the poles. \n\nMany Chinese acrobatics troupes feature plate spinning, usually in combination with contortion or acrobatic skills. These usually feature performers holding several plates in each hand spinning on sticks. \n\nWestern plate spinning performers usually present comedy acts and typically feature one performer with an assistant, spinning multiple plates on sticks held vertically in stands.\n\nOther forms of plate manipulation include plate waltzing, where plates are spun on their edges on a table top, and plate juggling, where plates are manipulated and thrown by the performers. Some performers have combined several of these elements into restaurant or kitchen-themed acts.\nThe Guinness World Record for spinning multiple plates is held by David Spathaky, assisted by Debbie Woolley, who spun 108 plates simultaneously in Bangkok, Thailand, on television in 1996. He had previously held and broken his own record four times since 1986.\n\nThe tune \"Sabre Dance\" is often played in the background. This was a popular act on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" (by Erich Brenn) and other American variety and talent shows during the early years of American television. Tom Griswold, co-host of \"The Bob & Tom Show\", a syndicated American comedy radio program, occasionally says he wishes he could see a plate spinner on TV again and wants to book one for his staff's annual Christmas party, which Chick McGee cites as further evidence that Griswold is out of touch with contemporary entertainment. In an episode of the \"Simpsons\", at the Springfield Retirement Castle talent show, one participant does a similar act, but uses the dentures of several of the residents. Plate spinning was often seen in HBO's prison drama \"Oz\", where an unnamed prisoner would often be seen spinning a book on the tip of a pen.\n\nThe popular game show \"The Generation Game\" would regularly feature a plate spinner demonstrating his skills, then inviting the contestants to have a go - with smashing results. During the 1960s & 1970s German Performer Wolfgang Bartschelly popularised plate spinning and regularly appeared on television. From the 1980s onward, the mantle was passed to British plate spinner, young Andrew Van Buren who regularly appeared and still can be seen presenting this format of plate spinning on game shows, on television and performing around the world.\n\n\n"}

Her father so much wanted the new baby to be a girl that the doctor presiding over the labour thought fit to protest that \"whoever sees those lovely Princes above stairs must be glad to have another.\" The King was so upset by this view he replied that \"whoever sees that lovely child the Princess Royal above stairs must not wish to have the fellow to her.\" To the King's delight, and the Queen's relief, the baby was a small and pretty girl.\n\nThe young princess was christened on 6 December 1768, by Frederick Cornwallis, The Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Great Council Chamber at St. James's Palace. Her godparents were Prince Charles of Mecklenburg (her maternal uncle, who was visiting England), The Queen-consort of Denmark (her paternal aunt, for whom The Duchess of Ancaster and Kesteven, Mistress of the Robes to The Queen, stood proxy) and The Hereditary Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg (her paternal aunt, for whom The Duchess of Northumberland, Lady of the Bedchamber to The Queen, stood proxy). Lady Mary Coke declared the month-old Augusta \"the most beautiful infant I ever saw\".\n\nPrincess Augusta was the middle of the elder trio of princesses that consisted of her, her older sister Charlotte (born 1766) and her younger sister Elizabeth (born 1770). In 1771, the two elder Princesses started travelling to Kew to take lessons under the supervision of Lady Charlotte Finch and Miss Frederica Planta. The Princesses, who had formerly been very close to their brothers now saw little of them, except when their paths crossed on daily walks. In 1774, Martha Goldsworthy, or \"Gouly\" became the new head of their educations. The Princesses learned typically feminine pursuits, such as deportment, music, dancing, and arts, but their mother also ensured that they learned English, French, German, Geography, and had well-educated governesses. \n\nThe young Augusta was a great favourite with Miss Planta, who called her \"the handsomest of all the Princesses\" though compared to her older sister, she was \"childish\". However, the princess was painfully shy, and stammered when in front of people she didn't know. From an early age Augusta was fixed on being good and was often upset when she did not succeed. Her behaviour veered in between troublesome and well-mannered. She sometimes threw tantrums and hit her governesses, though she also often had a calm disposition and family-minded ways. She strongly disliked the political tensions that by 1780 had sprung up between her elder brothers and their parents, and preferred to occupy herself with her coin collection. As all her sisters were, Augusta was sheltered from the outside world so much that her only friends were her attendants, with whom she kept up a frequent correspondence.\n\nIn 1782, Augusta had her debut into society at the King's birthday celebrations. As she was still terrified of crowds, her mother did not tell her daughter about her debut until two days before it happened. Later that year, the Princess's youngest brother, Alfred, died, followed eight months later by her next youngest brother, Octavius. When the Princesses went to see the summer exhibition in 1783 at the Royal Academy, they were so distraught by the portraits of their two youngest brothers that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. In August 1783 came the birth of Augusta's youngest sibling, Amelia. She stood as a godmother, along with Charlotte and George. Although the birth of her sister did not erase the pain she felt at losing her brothers, Augusta did not dwell on their deaths as her father did.\n\nBy the time they reached their teens, the three eldest Princesses were spending a great deal of time with their parents. They accompanied them to the theatre, to the Opera, and to Court, and their once academic lessons began to wind down, with music and the arts becoming the new focus. They heard famous actresses such as Sarah Siddons read, and along with Charlotte and their parents, Augusta met John Adams when he was presented to the Queen. The three girls were always dressed alike at public functions, the only difference ever in their dresses being colour. Though so often displayed in public, Augusta still was happiest at home, where she adored her younger brothers Ernest, Augustus, and Adolphus. She was also extremely close to her sister Elizabeth, as Charlotte was often haughty and overly conscious of her position as Princess Royal.\n\nSince they were quickly approaching a marriageable age, Augusta and the Princess Royal were given their first lady-in-waiting in July 1783. Augusta frequently wrote to her elder brother William, who was in Hanover for military training. She was a good correspondent, telling him family news and encouraging him to tell her what was happening in his life. She revelled in his attention and in the little gifts he sent her, even though the Queen tried to discourage William from taking up his sister's valuable time. Though their academic lessons were nearly over, the Queen was loath to have her daughters waste time, and made sure that the Princesses spent hours studying music or art, learning many types of specialty work from different masters.\n\nThe princesses did not \"dress\" until dinner, wearing morning gowns nearly all day. Even when \"dressed\", the Royal family often wore plain clothes, far removed from the ornate splendour of other courts. As there were six princesses, the Queen's expenses even for these clothes were enormous, and she tried to keep costs down and within the allowance she was given. Moving into this new phase of life meant that the amount of money the Queen was spending on her three eldest daughters was rapidly increasing. The Princesses constantly needed dresses, hats, trimmings, fans, and other items. The quarterly expense for their clothes was estimated to be £2000, and the expense of all their servants and tutors added to that. Yet it all paid off in one way: the Princesses were quickly becoming a familiar sight to the public. When their group portrait was exhibited to the people, it was marvelled at for the porcelain impersonal beauty they displayed. They were dressed the same, and only their accessories hinted at the very different personalities that lay underneath the painted masks.\n\nBy 1785, Augusta and Charlotte were reaching an age where they could be considered as potential brides for foreign princes. In that year the Crown Prince of Denmark (later King Frederick VI) indicated to King George III that he would break off every other discussed proposal for the hand in marriage of a British princess. He was also supposed to prefer Augusta to her older sister. However, the King declared that after the horrible treatment of his younger sister by the Crown Prince's father, King Christian VII, he would never send one of his daughters to the Danish court. As their friends and ladies of the court began to get married, the princesses wondered when their turn would come. In 1797, she received a proposal from Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden, a proposal given without the approval of the Swedish royal house. A British princess, especially from so fertile a mother, was a prize, but Augusta's father seemed increasingly unwilling to allow his daughters to marry.\n\nLargely denied access to personal relationships with men of their own rank, several of the daughters of George III embarked on such romances with gentleman at court. Augusta Sophia first met Sir Brent Spencer, a senior Anglo-Irish officer in the British Army, around 1800. As she wrote to her brother, the future King George IV, then Prince Regent, in 1812, the two had entered into an understanding around 1803, while Spencer was stationed in England. In 1805 he was appointed as an equerry to the king. The couple conducted their romance with the utmost privacy, and Augusta asked the Prince Regent in 1812 to consent to her marrying Spencer, promising further discretion in their behaviour.\n\nWhile no record of a marriage between the two exists, it was noted at the court of Hesse-Homburg at the time of her sister Elizabeth's marriage in 1818 that Augusta was \"privately married.\" It was Spencer who informed Augusta of her mother's death later that year, and Spencer was said to be holding a locket with Augusta's picture when he died in 1828.\n\nAccording to a flyer held by the V&A Archives, Princess Augusta was a patron of L. Bertolotto's flea circus.\n\nIn 1828 Augusta was heard to remark to a friend: “I was ashamed to hear myself called Princess Augusta, and never could persuade myself that I was so, as long as any of the Stuart family were alive; but after the death of Cardinal York [in 1807], I felt myself to be really Princess Augusta”.\n\nShe died on 22 September 1840 at Clarence House, St. James, London, and was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor on 2 October, after lying in state at Frogmore.\n\n\nAs of 1789, as a daughter of the sovereign, Augusta Sophia had use of the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a \"label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a rose gules, the outer points ermine\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2179915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179915", "title": "Villa Farnesina", "text": "Villa Farnesina\n\nThe Villa Farnesina is a Renaissance suburban villa in the Via della Lungara, in the district of Trastevere in Rome, central Italy.\n\nThe villa was built for Agostino Chigi, a rich Sienese banker and the treasurer of Pope Julius II. Between 1506–1510, the Sienese artist and pupil of Bramante, Baldassare Peruzzi, aided perhaps by Giuliano da Sangallo, designed and erected the villa. The novelty of this suburban villa design can be discerned from its differences from that of a typical urban palazzo (palace). Renaissance palaces typically faced onto a street and were decorated versions of defensive castles: rectangular blocks with rusticated ground floors and enclosing a courtyard. This villa, intended to be an airy summer pavilion, presented a side towards the street and was given a U-shaped plan with a five-bay loggia between the arms. In the original arrangement, the main entrance was through the north facing loggia which was open. Today, visitors enter on the south side and the loggia is glazed.\n\nChigi also commissioned the fresco decoration of the villa by artists such as Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo, Giulio Romano, and Il Sodoma. The themes were inspired by the \"Stanze\" of the poet Angelo Poliziano, a key member of the circle of Lorenzo de Medici. Best known are Raphael's frescoes on the ground floor; in the loggia depicting the classical and secular myths of Cupid and Psyche, and \"The Triumph of Galatea\". This, one of his few purely secular paintings, shows the near-naked nymph on a shell-shaped chariot amid frolicking attendants and is reminiscent of Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\". This same \"Galatea\" loggia has a horoscope vault that displays the positions of the planets around the zodiac on the patron's birth date, 29 November 1466. The two main ceiling panels of the vault give his precise time of birth, 9:30 pm on that date.\n\nAt first floor level, Peruzzi painted the main \"salone\" with \"trompe-l'œil\" frescoes of a grand open loggia with an illusory city and countryside view beyond. The perspective of the painted balcony and colonnade is very accurate from a fixed point in the room. In the adjoining bedroom, Sodoma painted scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, the marriage of Alexander and Roxana, and Alexander receives the family of Darius.\n\nThe villa became the property of the Farnese family in 1577 (hence the name of Farnesina). Also in the 16th century, Michelangelo proposed linking the Palazzo Farnese on the other side of the River Tiber, where he was working, to the Villa Farnesina with a private bridge. This was initiated, remnants of a few arches are in fact still visible in the back of Palazzo Farnese towards via Giulia on the other side of the Tiber, but was never completed.\n\nLater the villa belonged to the Bourbons of Naples and in 1861 to the Spanish Ambassador in Rome, Bermudez de Castro, Duke of Ripalta.

On one level, has been made a general restoration of the ancient settlement, respecting the original materials and building techniques (the restoration plan was developed by architect Giancarlo De Carlo); on another level, the village has been provided with a sophisticated technological infrastructure (the telematization project was conceived by Valerio Saggini and planned by Valerio Saggini and Stefania Belloni) which has enabled new inhabitants to benefit from the widest possible range of telecommunications resources. In this way, they are able to enjoy the peace and isolation offered by the village while staying in touch with the work environment and, more generally, with the information resources available all over the world. Thus it is possible for people to have the chance to \"telecommute\", to spend long periods in Colletta; periods which do not necessarily have to coincide with official holidays, or even decide to move their primary residence to Colletta.\n\nIn 2005, the village had its first olive harvest in 30 years and is now producing small quantities of high-grade olive oil from the local taggiasca olives.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179922", "title": "Epic of Sundiata", "text": "Epic of Sundiata\n\nThe Sundiata Keita or Epic of Sundiata (also referred to as the Sundiata Epic or Sunjata Epic) is an epic poem of the Malinke people that tells the story of the hero Sundiata Keita (died 1255), the founder of the Mali Empire. The epic is an instance of oral tradition, going back to the 13th century and narrated by generations of griot poets or \"jeliw\" (\"djeli\"). There is no single or authoritative version. Material pertaining to the epic first began to be collected during the early 20th century in French Sudan, notably by the French elite school École William Ponty, resulting in the \"modern\" version of the tale as considered standard today, as published in \"novelistic\" form in French translation by Djibril Tamsir Niane in 1960 (English translation 1965).\n\nThe amount of historicity of the events portrayed in the epic is open to debate. There are some limited 14th-century Arabic historiographic sources available on the early history and of the Mali Empire, notably the records of Ibn Khaldun. Therefore, the evidence of oral tradition may be critical in reconstructing the historical events of the period. Oral tradition necessarily undergoes significant changes over the course of several centuries, but scholars have nevertheless attempted to pinpoint elements in the epic that might reflect historical events.\n\nWritten summaries of the epic existed in Arabic before 1890. During the 1890s, versions of the epic were collected by French officials and published in French and German translation beginning in 1898. Western-educated West Africans began to produce literary versions of the tale beginning in the 1930s. This was notably the case at the French elite school, École William Ponty, which staged a drama based on the story in 1937. This period represents the first interaction of the oral tradition with literacy and modernity, and the transformations undergone by the narrative in the context of the 1937 presentation ... eventually resulted in the form of the epic which became most influential in the 1940s and 1950s, before the first \"novelistic\" treatment by Niane (1960). The first line-by-line transcription of the epic as told by a griot was made in 1967.\n\nAs an oral historical epic, Sundiata conveys information not only about the history of the Mali Empire, but also about the culture of the Mande ethnic group. Mande family structures had two elements—constructive (\"badenya\") or destructive (\"fadenya\"). \"Fadenya\", or \"father-child-ness,\" is the rivalry between half-siblings, and is represented in the epic of Sundiata by the animosity between Sundiata, son of Sogolon, and Dankaran Touman, son of Sassouma (king Nare Marghan's first wife). The destructive forces of fadenya eventually cause Sundiata and his mother to be exiled from Mali, in the fear that Sassouma would hurt Sogolon's family. \"Badenya\", or \"mother-child-ness,\" is the affection between children of the same mother. This is represented in the epic by the support of Sundiata's sister, Kolonkan, in watching over him against Sassouma's attempts at witchcraft, and by his siblings' later support of him in his battle to reclaim Mali. Maternal support is also important for Sundiata to overcome his physical impairment and begin to walk in response to his mother's pleading. The importance of the mother is underscored by the narrator, who says \"the child is worth no more than the mother is worth.\" Significantly, Sundiata needed both the opposing forces of \"fadenya\" and \"badenya\" to fulfill his destiny, indicating that both elements are necessary to Mande culture .\n\nThe epic of Sundiata is still an integral part of Mande traditional culture and the story continues to be retold by griots and through masked ritual performances. Today the epic of Sundiata has also become part of the official national mythology of the republics of Mali, Gambia, Senegal and Guinea and is studied in history lessons in primary school curricula.\n\nIn the \"Epic of Sundiata\" (also spelled Son-Jara or Sundjata) Naré Maghann Konaté (also called Maghan Kon Fatta or Maghan the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a soothsaying hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konaté married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king. Naré Maghann Konaté was already married to Sassouma Bereté and had a son by her, Dankaran Toumani Keïta. However, when two Traoré hunters from the Do kingdom presented him an ugly, hunchbacked woman named Sogolon, he remembered the prophecy and married her. She soon gave birth to a son, Sundiata Keita, who was unable to walk throughout his childhood. Sassouma was jealous of the child and mother and would make fun of Sundiata for his inability to walk and the ugliness he inherited from his mother. Despite his physical weakness, the king still granted Sundiata his own griot at young age; this was in order to have them grow together and provide constant consultation as was custom.\n\nWith the death of Naré Maghann Konaté (c. 1224), his first son, Dankaran Tuman, assumed the throne despite Konaté's wishes that the prophecy be respected. Sundiata and his mother, who now had given birth to two daughters and adopted a second son from Konaté's third wife Namandjé, suffered the scorn of the new king and his mother. After an insult against Sogolon, Sundiata requested an iron rod from the blacksmith Nounfari, which broke when he tried to use it in order to pull himself upright and walk. Only when he used a branch of S'ra (African baobab or Adansonian tree) was he able to walk. In one version of the epic, Sundiata is able to walk after his father dies and his mother orders him to do so. He then becomes a great hunter. Nonetheless, the hatred of Sassouma Bereté and Dankaran Toumani Keita soon drove Sundiata, his mother, and his two sisters into exile in the Mema kingdom. In one version of the epic, Sundiata and his mother are not exiled. Sogolon feels that she and her son are in danger because of Sassouma's jealousy and left to keep them safe. Neighboring kingdoms are unwilling to harbor Sundiata and Sogolon in fear of what Sassouma and her son would do, but the Mema people take them in.\n\nWhile living in the Mema kingdom, Sundiata began to grow \"as strong as a lion\", and he fought with the greatest general of the Mema people, Moussa Tounkara. Sundiata became such a great warrior to the degree that he was made heir to the Mema throne. However, Sogolon encouraged him to \"fulfill his destiny\" and return to Mali to become king.\n\nMeanwhile, Soumaoro Kanté, cruel sorcerer king of Sosso, attacked the Mandinka kingdom, causing Dankaran Toumani to take flight in fear. Before reaching Mali, Soumaoro had conquered nine kingdoms in the Ghana Empire. He was a notoriously cruel leader. The oppressed Mandinka people then sent for the exiled Sundiata. Forging a coalition of neighboring small kingdoms, Sundiata waged a war against the Sosso, finally Sundiata was later crowned with the title \"Mansa,\" or \"king of kings\", as the first ruler of the Mali Empire. He soon set about organizing the nucleus of the empire, presenting the Gbara of nobles and notables at his coronation with an oral constitution known as the Kouroukan Fouga. His model for government would guide the empire into greatness. His exploits have even been compared to those of Alexander the Great by some griots.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2179947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179947", "title": "Sally–Anne test", "text": "Sally–Anne test\n\nThe Sally–Anne test is a psychological test, used in developmental psychology to measure a person's social cognitive ability to attribute false beliefs to others. The flagship implementation of the Sally–Anne test was by Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan M. Leslie, and Uta Frith (1985); in 1988, Leslie and Frith repeated the experiment with human actors (rather than dolls) and found similar results.\n\nTo develop an efficacious test, Baron-Cohen \"et al.\" modified the puppet play paradigm of Wimmer and (1983), in which puppets represent tangible characters in a story, rather than hypothetical characters of pure storytelling. In the Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith study of theory of mind in autism, 61 children—20 of whom were diagnosed autistic under established criteria, 14 with Down syndrome and 27 of whom were determined as clinically unimpaired—were tested with \"Sally\" and \"Anne\".\n\nIn the test process, after introducing the dolls, the child is asked the control question of recalling their names (the \"Naming Question\"). A short skit is then enacted; Sally takes a marble and hides it in her basket. She then \"leaves\" the room and goes for a walk. While she is away, Anne takes the marble out of Sally's basket and puts it in her own box. Sally is then reintroduced and the child is asked the key question, the \"Belief Question\": \"Where will Sally look for her marble?\"\n\nFor a participant to pass this test, they must answer the \"Belief Question\" correctly by indicating that Sally believes that the marble is in her own basket. This answer is continuous with Sally's perspective, but not with the participant's own. If the participant cannot take an alternative perspective, they will indicate that Sally has cause to believe, as the participant does, that the marble has moved. Passing the test is thus seen as the manifestation of a participant understanding that Sally has her own beliefs that may not correlate with reality; this is the core requirement of theory of mind.\n\nIn the Baron-Cohen \"et al.\" (1985) study, 23 of the 27 clinically unimpaired children (85%) and 12 of the 14 Down syndrome children (86%) answered the \"Belief Question\" correctly. However, only four of the 20 autistic children (20%) answered correctly. Overall, children under the age of four, along with most autistic children (of older ages), answered the \"Belief Question\" with \"Anne's box\", seemingly unaware that Sally does not know her marble has been moved.\n\nThe test is by no means fully conclusive; however, its application is telling about social development trends in autism.\n\nWhile Baron-Cohen et al.'s data have been purported to indicate a lack of theory of mind in autistic children, there are other possible factors affecting them. For instance, individuals with autism may pass the cognitively simpler recall task, but language issues in both autistic children and deaf controls tend to confound results.\n\nRuffman, Garnham, and Rideout (2001) further investigated links between the Sally–Anne test and autism in terms of eye gaze as a social communicative function. They added a third possible location for the marble: the pocket of the investigator. When autistic children and children with moderate learning disabilities were tested in this format, they found that both groups answered the Belief Question equally well; however, participants with moderate learning disabilities reliably looked at the correct location of the marble, while autistic participants did not, \"even if\" the autistic participant answered the question correctly. These results may be an expression of the social deficits relevant to autism.\n\nTager-Flusberg (2007) states that in spite of the empirical findings with the Sally-Anne task, there is a growing uncertainty among scientists about the importance of the underlying theory-of-mind hypothesis of autism. In all studies that have been done, some children with autism pass false-belief tasks such as Sally-Anne.\n\nEye tracking of chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans suggests that all three anticipate the false beliefs of a subject in a King Kong suit, and pass the Sally–Anne test.\n"}

His father, Juan Esteban Espoz y Mina, and his mother, Maria Teresa Hundain y Ardaiz, belonged to the class of yeomen, rural smallholders. Mina worked on the small family farm until 1808. When Napoleon endeavoured to seize Spain in that year he enlisted in the Doyle regiment, and then entered the guerrilla group commanded by his nephew Francisco Javier Mina. When Javier was captured by the French on 21 March 1810, seven men of the group chose to follow Francisco, and on 1 April 1810 the Junta of Aragon gave him the command of the guerrilleros of Navarre. \n\nHis first act was to arrest and shoot at Estella a certain Echevarria, who, under pretence of being a guerrillero, was in fact a brigand. The national government in Cadiz gave him rank, and by 7 September 1812 he had been promoted to the rank of commander-in-chief in Upper Aragon, on the left bank of the Ebro. In the interval he claimed that he had fought 143 actions big and little, had been repeatedly wounded with bullet, sword and lance, had taken 13 fortified posts, and 14,000 prisoners, and had never been surprised by the French. \n\nThough some maintain that he was not at his best as a leader in battle, as a strategist Espoz y Mina was very successful and displayed great organizing capacity. The French authorities were compelled to allow him to levy customs dues on all goods imported into Spain, except contraband of war, which he would not allow to pass without fighting. The money thus obtained was used to pay his bands a regular salary. He was able to avoid levying excessive contributions on the country and to maintain discipline among his men, whom he had brought to a respectable state of efficiency in 1812. Espoz y Mina claimed that he immobilized 26,000 French troops which would but for him have served with Marshal Marmont in the Salamanca campaign. In the campaign of 1813 and 1814 he served with distinction under the Duke of Wellington. \n\nAfter the restoration of Ferdinand VII he fell into disfavour. On 25/26 September he attempted to bring about an uprising at Pamplona in favor of the Liberal party, but failed, and went into exile. His political opinions were democratic and radical, and as a yeoman he disliked the \"hidalgos\" (low-ranking nobles). The Revolution of 1820 brought him back, and he served the Liberal party during the Trienio Liberal in Galicia, Leon and Catalonia. In this last district he made the only vigorous resistance to the French intervention in favor of Ferdinand VII. On 1 November 1823 he was compelled to capitulate, and the French allowed him to escape to England by sea. In 1830 he took part in an unsuccessful rising against Ferdinand. \n\nOn the death of the king he was recalled to Spain, and the government of the regent Christina gave him the command against the Carlists in 1835, though they feared his Radicalism. By this time, years, exposure and wounds had undermined his health. He was also opposed to Tomás de Zumalacárregui, an old officer of his in the War of Independence, and an even greater master of irregular mountain warfare. His health compelled him to resign in April 1835, and his later command in Catalonia was only memorable for the part he took in forcing the regent to grant a constitution in August 1836. He died at Barcelona on 24 December 1836. \n\nIn 1825 Espoz y Mina published \"A Short Extract from the Life of General Mina\", in Spanish and English, in London. Mention is made of him in all histories of the affairs of Spain during the first third of the 19th century. His full \"Memoirs\" were published by his widow at Madrid in 1851–52. The Plaza de Mina in Cadiz, Spain is named after him.\n\n"}

{"id": "2179965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179965", "title": "Deinotheriidae", "text": "Deinotheriidae\n\nDeinotheriidae (\"terrible beasts\") is a family of prehistoric elephant-like proboscideans that lived during the Cenozoic era, first appearing in Africa, then spreading across southern Asia (Indo-Pakistan) and Europe. During that time, they changed very little, apart from growing much larger in size; by the late Miocene, they had become the largest land animals of their time. Their most distinctive features were the downward-curving tusks on the lower jaw.\n\nDeinotheres were not very diverse; the only three known genera are \"Chilgatherium\", \"Prodeinotherium\", and \"Deinotherium\". These form an evolutionary succession, with each new genus replacing the preceding one. Unlike the various mammoth and mastodont lineages, the deinotheres died out in the early Pleistocene, rather than continuing through the ice age.\n\nThe body shape and proportions of deinotheres were very much like those of modern elephants. The legs were long, like modern elephants, but the skull was rather flatter than that of true elephants. The upper jaw lacked incisor and canine teeth, but possessed five low-crowned molars on each side, with the same number in the lower jaw. Deinotheres used their front teeth for crushing their food, and the back teeth for shearing (slicing) the plant material. The front part of the lower jaw was turned downwards, and bore the two tusk-like incisors. These curved downwards and backwards in a sort of huge hook, and constituted the most distinct feature of the deinotheres. The tusks were used to strip vegetation rather than for digging.\n\nDeinotheres were \"shearing browsers\" adapted for feeding on plants above ground level. The way they chewed their food was probably similar to that of modern tapirs, with the front teeth being used to crush the food, while the second and third molars have a strong vertical shearing action, with little lateral (side-to-side) movement. This chewing action differs from both that of gomphotheres (lateral grinding) and elephants (horizontal shearing). Deinothere molars show little wear, indicating a diet of soft, nongritty, forest vegetation, with the down-turned lower tusks being used for stripping bark or other vegetation.\n\n\"Deinotherium giganteum\" has a more elongated lower fore limb than early and middle Miocene \"Prodeinotherium\", indicating a more efficient stride as an adaptation to the spread of savannas in Europe during the late Miocene. Deinotheres probably migrated from forest to forest, traversing the wide and (to them) useless grasslands.\n\nThe ancestry and evolutionary relationships of the deinotheres remain obscure. They are thought to be related to the barytheres, due to similarities in the structure of the teeth. They clearly diverged from the rest of the proboscideans at a very early date. In the 1970s, several researchers placed them in a separate order to the Proboscidea, but this view is not followed nowadays.\n\nThe oldest known deinothere is \"Chilgatherium harrisi\" from the late Oligocene. Its fossil remains have been found in the district of Chilga in Ethiopia (hence the name). This indicates that, like other proboscideans, deinotheres evolved in Africa. \"Chilgatherium\" was quite small, about midway between a large pig and a small hippopotamus in size.\n\nBy the early Miocene, deinotheres had grown to the size of a small elephant, and had migrated to Eurasia. Several species are known, all belonging to the genus \"Prodeinotherium\".\n\nDuring the late middle Miocene, these modest-seized proboscideans were replaced by much larger forms across Eurasia. In Europe, \"Prodeinotherium bavaricum\" appeared in the early Miocene mammal faunal zone MN 4, but was soon replaced by \"Deinotherium giganteum\" in the middle Miocene. Likewise in Asia, \"Prodeinotherium\" is known from the early Miocene strata in the Bugti Hills, and continued into the middle Miocene Chinji Formation, where it was replaced by \"D. indicum\".\n\nWhile these Miocene deinotheres were dispersed widely and evolved to huge elephant size, they were not as common as the contemporary (but smaller) Euelephantoidea. Fossil remains of this age are known from the France, Germany, Greece, Malta, and northern India and Pakistan. These consist chiefly of teeth and the bones of the skull.\n\nAfter the extinction of the indricotheres at the end of the early Miocene, the deinotheres were (and remained) the largest animals walking the Earth.\n\nThe late Miocene was the heyday of the giant deinotheres. \"D. giganteum\" was common from Vallesian and Turolian localities in Europe. \"Prodeinotherium\", which was reasonably well represented in the early Miocene of Africa, was succeeded by \"D. bozasi\" at the beginning of the late Miocene. And in Asia, \"D. indicum\" was most common in the late-Miocene Dhok Pathan Formation.\n\nFossil teeth of \"D. giganteum\", from the late-Miocene Sinap Formation at the Turkish site of Kayadibi are larger than those from older localities, such as Eppelsheim, Wissberg, and Montredon, indicating a tendency for increasing size of members of the species over time. These were the biggest animals of their day, protected from both predators and rival herbivores by virtue of their huge bulk. The largest mammoths did not approach them in size until the Pleistocene.\n\nWith the end of the Miocene, deinothere fortunes declined. \"D. indicum\" died out about 7 million years ago, possibly driven to extinction by the same process of climate change that had previously eliminated the even more enormous \"Indricotherium\". While in Europe, \"D. giganteum\" continued, albeit with dwindling numbers, until the middle Pliocene; the most recent specimen is from Romania.\n\nIn its original African homeland, \"Deinotherium\" continued to flourish throughout the Pliocene, and fossils have been uncovered at several of the African sites where remains of hominids have also been found.\n\nThe last deinothere species to become extinct was \"D. bozasi\". The youngest known specimens are from the Kanjera Formation, Kenya, about 1 million years ago (early Pleistocene). The causes of the extinction of such a successful and long-lived animal are not known, although a small number of other species of African megafauna also died out at this time.\n\n"}

Neill\n\nJames Clinton Neill (c. 17881848) was a 19th-century American soldier and politician, most noted for his role in the Texas Revolution and the early defense of the Alamo. He was born in North Carolina.\n\nJames Clinton Neill was born in 1788 in Rowan County, North Carolina, the third child (and third son) of James Neill and Hannah Clayton Neill. William Clinton Neill (James Clinton's grandfather), was a captain in the American Revolution, who along with five of his sons, including James Clinton's father James, fought in the War for Independence. James Clinton's uncle, Lieutenant William Neill, was killed at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill. The Clinton middle name comes from both his paternal grandfather and grandmother, Captain William Clinton Neill and his wife Mary \"Polly\" Clinton Neill. \n\nBy at least 1807, some members of the James Neill family had moved to south-central Tennessee, in and around Bedford and Marshall counties. In this vicinity, James Clinton married Margaret Harriett Ferguson in 1807. It is likely that James Clinton Neill was acquainted with a near-neighbor around those parts at the same time, David Crockett, another Tennessean who would become a Texas Revolution hero. Like Crockett, J.C. Neill fought in the Creek Indian War, enlisting with the West Tennessee Militia (protecting present day Alabama). He enlisted on October 1, 1813 and was discharged on March 15, 1815. He participated in the latter part of the War of 1812, during the Creek War. Although wounded, he fought in the decisive battle against the Red Sticks, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.\n\nNeill served as a captain under Major William Woodfolk. The battalion was designated as \"Separate Battalion of West Tennessee Militia\". This battalion was based at Fort Jackson most of the time from late November 1814 to early 1815. Some of the men were stationed at Fort Decatur, where the remnants of the defeated Creek Nation came to surrender, seeking food and supplies (surrendering Creeks also went to Fort Jackson). One company, under Captain Abner Pearce, was stationed at Fort Montgomery. Woodfolk was a wealthy land speculator who owned a large plantation in Jackson County. In addition to potentially sharing time with Davy Crockett, during this military service James Clinton Neill may well have also met his future Texas Revolution commander, Sam Houston.\n\nBy at least 1820, J.C. Neill had moved his family to Greene County, Alabama. He served in the Alabama state legislature and was also a justice of the peace in Jackson County. He lived in Tennessee (present day Alabama) with his wife Margaret Harriett, who bore him three childrenGeorge Jefferson Neill (b. 1808), Samuel Clinton Neill (b. 1815) and Harriett (b. 1820).\n\nThe family moved to Texas in 1831 with Stephen F. Austin's third colony where he received a league of land (4,428) acres. They settled in (Viesca District) which is now Milam County. Neill served as a district representative in the Convention of 1833.\n\nDue to his previous experience in battle, Neill had some knowledge of artillery. In 1834 Neill and his family moved to Mina, modern day Bastrop. On September 28, 1835, when armed conflict with Antonio López de Santa Anna's Mexican troops seemed inevitable, he joined the Texian militia as a captain of artillery. On October 2, 1835, he saw action at the conflict at Gonzales. Texian John Holland Jenkins recorded that Neill actually fired the famed Gonzales \"Come and Take It\" cannon, crediting him with firing \"the first shot of the Texas Revolution.\"\n\nAfter Gonzales, James would move onwards to the Alamo and join with Stephen F. Austin's forces in the Siege of Bexar. From December 5–10, Neill's battery provided covering fire for the assault on San Antonio de Béxar. He had gained an additional artillery piece from the Battle of Concepción and two more from the New Orleans Grays. They would be placed in the Texian post, just west of the Alamo, confronting the town, however their fire could not shake Cos from Bexar. Then, Neill and his command formed a plan. They took a cannon across the San Antonio River and fired upon the Alamo as a diversionary tactic. The plan worked and the Texians were able to enter into Bexar. House to house fighting would eventually push the Mexicans back and into the Alamo. On December 8, the Mexican Army made a counterattack, Neill and his crew were there to answer back with canister. The flying hailstorm would quickly end the advance, ultimately resulting in the surrender of the Mexican forces on December 9.\n\nOn December 7, the Texas General Council had commissioned Neill lieutenant colonel of artillery in the regular Texian army. Having received several captured Mexican field pieces to augment his firepower, he now commanded over twenty artillery pieces, the largest amount west of the Mississippi River and north of the Rio Grande.\nNeill had been recommended for the commission by one of his neighbors, D. C. Barrett, who wrote to Texian Army commander Sam Houston that \"age and experience with his militia rank & title, would seem to justify his first commission as a field officer\".\n\nOn December 21, 1835, Houston requested that Neill, now a lieutenant colonel of an artillery company, take command of the Texian and Tejano garrison stationed at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Bexar. The orders also specified that Neill should make a report to Houston detailing the current state of the defenses in the city and what improvements were needed.\n\nThe Texian garrison was woefully undermanned and underprovisioned, with fewer than 100 soldiers remaining by January 6, 1836. Neill wrote to the provisional government: \"If there has ever been a dollar here I have no knowledge of it\". Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing that the garrison was likely unable to withstand a siege greater than four days. The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance. Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army; on January 14 Neill approached Houston for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition.\n\nOn January 17, 1836, James Bowie arrived to evaluate the situation, with the suggestion from Sam Houston to remove the artillery and blow up the Alamo. Houston had written the Provisional Government asking for approval of his orders. Houston sent Bowie to San Antonio because he trusted Bowie's opinion. Instead of leaving the Alamo and falling back to Gonzales or Copano Bay, Bowie and Neill became committed to its defense. Bowie, impressed with Neill's leadership, wrote, \"\"No other man in the army could have kept men at this post, under the neglect they have experienced\".\" Despite Houston's orders to have the Alamo destroyed as indefensible, Neill and Bowie vowed \"\"... we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy.\"\" However, Neill was soon badly in need of supplies, as well as soldiers.\n\nOn February 11, Neill left the Alamo, to care for his family, overcome with a serious illness. He transitioned command to William Barret Travis, the highest-ranking regular army officer in the garrison. Due to a rift in the command of the Alamo between Bowie and Travis, Neill returned to the Alamo on February 14 and settled the dispute. A resolution was reached; Bowie and Travis would hold joint command of the Alamo. Neill would leave San Antonio just before the siege of the Alamo. On the day of the final Alamo battle, Neill was in Gonzales steadily working to increase the roster of the Alamo relief forces. In Gonzales, he signed a personal voucher on March 6, for ninety dollars to buy medicine for the Alamo garrison. Neill was intent on heading back to the Alamo where unknown to him, the fort had already fallen to Mexican troops on March 6, during the Battle of the Alamo. On March 7, Neill with Burleson gathered 50 men and headed for the Alamo.\nThey came close to the Alamo but were repulsed by Mexican cavalry. Neill returned to Gonzales on March 10 after leaving a small party of scouts to observe, who also returned to Gonzales the next day.\n\nFrom late February until Houston's arrival on March 11, Neill had been in command of the relief troops gathering at Gonzales. Two days later, on March 13, word was received that the Alamo had fallen. Thus, Neill once again relinquished his command and joined the withdrawal of Sam Houston's army to Groce's Retreat on the Brazos River. Unable to transport their cannons, Houston ordered them dumped into the Guadalupe River before abandoning Gonzales. That changed on April 11 when the \"Twin Sisters\" —two matched six-pounders— reached the Texian camp. The brass cannons were a gift from the people of Cincinnati, Ohio. Since Neill was a ranking artillery officer, Houston named him to command the revived artillery corps. On April 20, Neill commanded the Twin Sisters during the Battle of San Jacinto. During this fight, his artillery corps repulsed an enemy probe of the woods in which the main Texian Army was concealed. Neill was seriously wounded when a fragment of a Mexican grapeshot caught him in the hip. The final Battle of San Jacinto was fought on April 21.\n\n1838: received a league of land (including a parcel in Henderson County along the confluence of Walnut Creek and the Trinity River) for his services during the revolution.\n\n1839: ran for the position of major general of militia, losing to newcomer Felix Huston.\n\n1842: led a ranging expedition along the upper Trinity River, to control hostile Indians.\n\n1844: appointed as an Indian agent, responsible for vast areas of Texas.\n\n1845: granted a lifetime pension of $200 a year, as compensation for San Jacinto injuries.\n\nIn 1848, he died at his home on Spring Creek in Navarro County, Texas and was buried next to his wife, who had died near Seguin, Texas in February 1836.\n\nOn land owned with two partners, David Reed Mitchell and Thomas I. Smith, one hundred acres was donated on which the town of Corsicana, Texas would be founded in 1848.\n\nIn 1936 a Texas centennial marker was placed in Guadalupe County, Seguin, Texas in his honor.\n\nIn 1986 a Texas sesquicentennial marker was placed in Navarro County, Corsicana, Texas in his honor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179973", "title": "Stephen Flemmi", "text": "Stephen Flemmi\n\nStephen Joseph Flemmi (born June 9, 1934) is an Italian-American gangster and close associate of Winter Hill Gang boss Whitey Bulger. Beginning in 1975, Flemmi was a top echelon informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nDespite delivering a great deal of intelligence about the inner workings of the Patriarca crime family, Flemmi's own criminal activities proved a public relations nightmare for the FBI. He was ultimately brought up on charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and pleaded guilty in return for a sentence of life in prison.\n\nStephen Joseph Flemmi was the eldest of two or three sons (one brother was Vincent Flemmi) born to Italian immigrants Giovanni and Mary Irene Flemmi in Boston, Massachusetts. He was raised in the Orchard Park tenement located at 25 Ambrose Street in Roxbury, Massachusetts. His father was a bricklayer and veteran of the Royal Italian Army during World War I, and his mother was a full-time homemaker.\n\nFlemmi enlisted in the Army in 1951 at the age of 17 and served two tours of duty in Korea with the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. He was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star Medal decorations for valor.\n\nIn 1965, James J. \"Whitey\" Bulger was released from Federal prison after serving a nine-year sentence for robbing banks. After a few years of working as a janitor, he became an enforcer for South Boston mob boss Donald Killeen. After Killeen was murdered by an enforcer for the Mullen Gang, Winter Hill Gang boss Howie Winter mediated the dispute between Bulger and the remaining Killeens and the Mullens, who were led by Patrick Nee. Winter soon chose Bulger as his man in South Boston. Shortly afterward, Bulger became partners with Flemmi.\n\nAt this time, the Boston FBI office tried to convince Bulger to become an informant, but he refused.\n\nBulger allegedly told Flemmi that he knew his secret. Flemmi has insisted that he did not know at the time that Bulger was also an informant. Kevin Weeks, however, insists that Flemmi's story is untrue. He considers it too much of a coincidence that Bulger became an informant a year after becoming Flemmi's partner. He has written off his belief that Flemmi had probably helped to build a Federal case against him. Weeks has said that Bulger was likely forced to choose between supplying information to the FBI or returning to prison.\n\nIn the 1950s, Flemmi was married to an Irish-American woman named Jeanette, from whom he later became estranged. By 1980, he planned to divorce Jeanette to marry his longtime mistress, Marilyn DeSilva, but it is unknown whether he ever followed through with the legal actions. Throughout his life, Flemmi was engaged in clandestine affairs with several other women, including sisters Debra Davis and Michelle Davis, and Deborah Hussey.\nFlemmi met Debra Davis at a jewelry store, and the couple dated for more than seven years. In 1981, Bulger is said to have killed Davis because she knew that Flemmi was an informant.\n\nFour years after killing Davis, in 1985, Flemmi and Bulger killed Deborah Hussey, who was also Flemmi's stepdaughter (born to his common-law wife, Marion A. Hussey). Deborah was first sexually molested by Flemmi in her teens—she informed her mother that Flemmi had molested her for years—and had been his girlfriend since. In the days prior to her murder, Hussey was close to breaking up with Flemmi and telling her mother about their relationship, which is thought to have been the motive for her murder. \n\nIt is thought that Flemmi, Bulger, and Weeks lured her to the house at 799 East Third Street in South Boston and garrotted her. Her body was then buried in the basement. According to Kevin Weeks, \n\nRico first recruited Flemmi as an informant in 1965.\n\nIn 1997, shortly after \"The Boston Globe\" disclosed that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, former Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks met with John Connolly, who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, \"The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them.\" According to Weeks, \n\nIn December 1994, Connolly informed Bulger and Flemmi that several imprisoned Jewish-American bookmakers had agreed to testify to paying them protection money. As a result, sealed indictments had come from the Department of Justice and the FBI was due to make arrests during the Christmas season. In response, Bulger fled Boston on December 23, 1994, accompanied by his common law wife, Catherine Greig.\n\nAccording to Kevin Weeks, Flemmi, however, chose to remain in Boston and was swiftly taken into custody and incarcerated at the Plymouth County House of Correction.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, two of Flemmi's co-defendants, Boston mafiosi Frank Salemme and Bobby DeLuca, were listening to tape from a roving bug, which is normally authorized when the FBI has no advance knowledge of where criminal activity will take place. They overheard two of the agents who were listening in on the bug mention that they should have told one of their informants to give \"a list of questions\" to the other wiseguys. When their lawyer, Tony Cardinale, learned about this, he realized that the FBI had lied about the basis for a roving bug in order to protect an informant. Suspecting that this was not the only occasion that this happened, Cardinale sought to force prosecutors to reveal the identities of any informants used in connection with the case.\n\nEventually, both Bulger and Flemmi were revealed to be FBI informants. Flemmi believed that as a result, he had protection from the FBI, but not immunity. He initially planned to prove through his own testimony and that of others that he was being prosecuted for crimes that were effectively authorized by the FBI. He believed that as a result, Judge Mark L. Wolf would have no choice but to throw out the entire indictment. Flemmi's problem was that he couldn't really come clean. Without immunity, he couldn't admit to killings he hadn't been charged with. By the time Flemmi took the stand, in August 1998, John Martorano had pleaded guilty and started outlining the details of almost twenty murders he'd committed. Many of his murders had been done at the direction of Bulger and Flemmi, who had paid him more than $1 million during his years as a wanted fugitive between 1978 and 1995. To many questions about the murders Flemmi was involved in, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment.\n\nHowever, by 2000, it was obvious this gambit had failed. Out of desperation, he ordered Weeks to get in touch with retired state police lieutenant Richard J. Schneiderhan, a lifelong friend who had been on Winter Hill's payroll for virtually his entire career, to leak information about several wiretaps investigators were monitoring in hopes of tracking down Bulger. However, when Weeks reached a plea bargain a year later, he admitted Schneiderhan's role in the leak. Schneiderhan was ultimately convicted of obstructing justice and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. In 2000, Flemmi's brother Michael, then a retired Boston Police Department officer, was arrested for moving an arsenal of more than 70 weapons from their mother's shed after learning that it was to be the target of a search warrant. He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. A year later, he pleaded guilty to selling a load of Flemmi's stolen jewelry for $40,000.\n\nBy 2003, Flemmi realized he was at the end of his tether. Salemme and several others had joined Weeks in turning informer, and had disclosed enough information to ensure Flemmi would die in prison. He also potentially faced the death penalty for murders in Florida and Oklahoma. In October, Flemmi pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Boston to 10 counts of murder and accepted a sentence of life in prison without parole. He made the decision as a part of a deal to reduce the sentence for his brother, Michael Flemmi.\n\nFlemmi testified against Connolly at the latter's trial for the murder of John Callahan, the former president of World Jai Alai. Callahan had been killed in 1981 after he was implicated in the murder of his successor as president, Roger Wheeler. According to Flemmi, Connolly told him and Bulger that Callahan could potentially turn state's evidence and implicate them in Wheeler's murder. He also testified against Bulger in the latter's 2013 trial for murder and racketeering, at which Bulger was sentenced to life plus five years.\n\nIn the Whitey Bulger biopic \"Black Mass\" (2015), Flemmi is portrayed by Rory Cochrane.\n\nIn the movie \"The Departed\" (2006), Flemmi was the inspiration for the character Mr. French, portrayed by Ray Winstone.\n\nStephen Flemmi and Whitey Bulger are alleged to have committed statutory rape against numerous underage girls, some as young as 13, during the 1970s and 80s, deliberately getting them hooked on heroin and then sexually exploiting them for years.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2179974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179974", "title": "Albenga", "text": "Albenga\n\nAlbenga (; ) is a city and \"comune\" situated on the Gulf of Genoa on the Italian Riviera in the Province of Savona in Liguria, northern Italy. Albenga has the nickname of \"city of a hundred spires\". The economy is mostly based on tourism, local commerce and agriculture. Albenga has six hamlets: San Fedele, Lusignano, Campochiesa, Leca, Bastia, Salea.\nA settlement of pre-Roman origins on the west side of the Ligurian coast, it was founded around the 4th century BC on the slopes of the coastal hills, becoming the capital of the Ingauni Ligures tribe, who dedicated themselves to marine activities and controlled a large territory between Finale and Sanremo.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War the city allied itself with the Carthaginians, but was defeated by the Romans under proconsul Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus in 181 BC. The following year the Romans and the Ingauni signed a \"foedus\" (alliance agreement) which began the total Romanization of the whole region. Put under Latin rights in 89 BC, \"Albingaunum\" was granted Roman citizenship in 45 BC under Julius Caesar, starting to enjoy, with the beginning of the Empire, a period of prosperity. A further boost for the city came from the building of the Via Julia Augusta (13 BC), connecting it to southern France and Spain. In the meantime the intense exploitation of the flat land around the city continued; an inscription records the restoration of the walls, forum, and harbor, by Constantius in A.D. 354.\n\nDuring the 5th century, the city suffered from raids by the Visigoths, who partly destroyed and sacked it. The old Municipium, which now in a disastrous conditions, was rebuilt through the intervention of emperor Constantius III who gave the city stability and a defensive structure that allowed it to survive through the following centuries. Albenga established itself as a commune in 1098; in that same year it took part in the First Crusade with vessels, men and money, receiving rights of free trade by the King of Jerusalem. From that time on, the Golden Red Cross coat of arms was displayed on its ships and on its towers.\n\nLater, after the invasion of northern Italy by emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the city supported him thanks to its Ghibelline allegiance, which was never abandoned during the following centuries. In 1159 it received imperial investiture for all its territory.\n\nIn 1798 Albenga was declared capital of the Centa Jurisdiction, as part of the short living constitution of the Ligurian Republic. In 1815 the city, together with the whole of Liguria, was assigned to the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia, becoming the capital of a province including Andora and Finale Ligure.\n\nIn 1863, after the unification of Italy, the province was reduced to a district, and was abolished completely in 1927. At the time Albenga had been reduced to an agricultural village, overtaken by other coastal towns in both economic and demographic development, owing to their superior touristic appeal.\n\nThe name of Albenga comes from the Latin \"Albíngaunum\" that comes from \"Album Ingaunum\", that is means the capital city + genitive plural in -um. The ethnonym Ingauni ing consists of Indo-European origin, and a name of Gaulish-ligurian land. \"Album\" comes from \"alb\" o \"alp\" an ancient pre-Indo-European (rock, hill), often erroneously assocciata to \"album\" a Latin word meaning white or clear. The first name was Album Ingaunum, but when it was conquered by the Romans, the name became \"Albingaunum\"; after the Roman Empire the name became \"Albinauno\" and near the 1000 became \"Albingano\". Only in the 14th century did the name become \"Albenga\".\n\nAlbenga is located in the west Riviera. It has a homonymous plain at the mouth of the river Centa, which over the centuries has been the architect of the Albenga's plain, remodeling the ground several times and forcing the Albenganesi to adopt embankments and bridges since its foundation. Until the 17th century, it based its economy on maritime trade, as the city was built on the delta of the Centa and was surrounded by walls and bridges. With the closure of other roads estuary delta, which occurred first at the hands of the Genoese and later as the work of nature, now the river runs along the center flowing to the estuary. Even the memory of the old bridges was deleting itself.\nIt is the main center of the district \"Albenganese\", which extends from Finale to Andora and its hinterland.\nIt includes the nature reserve of island Gallinara, where apparently lived St. Martin of Tours. Just dedicated to this saint was a monastery on the island. After 1064 it became the possession of the abbey of Abbadia Alpina.\n\nThe climate is mild along the coast, with mild winters and both hot and cold summers, rarely mitigated by the sea breeze. The inner part of the plain has more continental characteristics, which create a greater temperature range, with harsher winters and summers.\n\nBuilt on the ancient orthogonal structure that had the current \"Via Medaglie d'oro\" and \"Via Enrico d'Aste\" respectively as the Roman camp main road axes (cardo and decumanus), the town has its planimetric hub in the historical San Michele Square. Around it some palaces were built, which were historically the seats of political and religious authorities.\n\nBuilt on the basic structures of the early Christian basilica put up by orders of Constantius III between the 4th and 5th century, it has a façade with traces of the transformation from Romanesque to Gothic. From this same period are the two lateral portals of the main facade and a third one the left side of the church, that hosts a restored Lombard bas-relief; the central portal dates from 1669.\n\nThe current design is the result of further elevations. The restoration works between 1964 and 1967 brought back the cathedral design to its original medieval aspect. The nearby steeple was attached to the church in the 13th century, built over the ruins of the old bell tower between the years 1391 and 1395. This construction is one of the last local examples of the use of bare bricks, progressively replaced by plastering.\n\nThe baptistery is located to the side of the Cathedral, as it was typical of the early Christian structures, and can be visited from the Loggia of the old City Hall Palace. It has an octagonal interior dating to the 5th century. The current appearance dates from a late 19th-century restoration work, carried on by Alfredo D'Andrade. During those works, the original basin vaulted roof, built with the Byzantine-Ravennate technique of the \"tubi fittili\" (terracotta tubes), was completely destroyed. The mosaic decorations of the vault of the presbytery go back to the 5th and 6th centuries.\n\nDating back to the early 14th century, it has undergone several renovations over the years before receiving its present appearance.\n\nIt housed the Council Hall (the big bell still calls the citizens when the council committee meets in the new town hall) and the jail. The lower floor dates from the 14th century, while the upper one was reconstructed in 1387–1391. The façade towards the baptistery has Ghibelline-style merlons with two large staircases. Since 1933, it houses the Ingauni Museum. The latter, established in 1933 by Nino Lamboglia, collects objects and medieval Roman (sculptures, inscriptions, sarcophagi and 15th-century frescoes), archaeological and epigraphic collections.\n\nLocated near the baptistery, it dates from the 11th century, with a 13th-century portal. It is the seat of the local bishop and houses the Holy Art Museum. The wing leading to the baptistery show several construction phases from the 13th and 14th centuries. The decoration with black and white stripes was added in 1463 under bishop Napoleone Fieschi. The heraldic fresco is by Giovanni Canavesio (1477).\n\nThe Diocesan Museum of Albenga occupies a series of rooms decorated with frescoes, it houses works of art and findings from the excavation of the cathedral. Among the paintings stand out a \"St. John \"attributed to Caravaggio and \"The Martyrdom of Saint Catherine\" by Guido Reni.\n\nRestructured by Emperor Augustus in 13 BC, the Via Julia Augusta was the most important communication link in the Riviera up until the construction of the Napoleonic road closer to the sea, the current site of the Via Aurelia. Its path, with plenty of Roman buildings destined to funerary celebrations, makes an archaeological walk beautiful also from a panoramic an naturalistic point of view.\n\nAlbenga is also home to the remains of a Roman amphitheatre dating from the 3rd century BC. It represents the only example of theatrical construction known on the entire Western Riviera.

The debut single, \"Die Walküre\", was based on a vocal from Freeez's \"I.O.U.\" (although the woman in the video is Josy Gil Persia) and reached #20 on the French Singles Chart. It was followed by \"Shadows\" one year later. After this, the group recruited Dawn Mitchell to front the act. \"Touch Me\" was partially based on an Aretha Franklin sample (\"Rock-a-Lott\"), whilst its chorus line was taken from Alysha Warren's song, \"Touch Me\". \"Don't You Love Me\" featured a vocal sample from Jody Watley's hit \"Don't You Want Me\" and peaked at number 78 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Other borrowed phrases and hooks are dispersed throughout the accompanying album. It was revealed that Mitchell was Lip-syncing the vocals on \"Touch Me\". She then provided vocals on five other songs from that album.\n\"Touch Me\" became a number 3 hit in the UK Singles Chart in January 1990, whilst \"Don't You Love Me\" peaked at number 12 and the single \"Girl to Girl\" peaked at number 31 in that same listing.\n\nA remix album and the stand-alone single \"Believe In Me\" (which Mitchell co-wrote and sang) was released in 1991. Soon afterwards, Mitchell left the act and was replaced by Ann-Marie Smith. The second album, \"Playing With My Heart\", was released in 1992. The album spawned five singles, \"Move Your Feet\", \"Got to Be Free\", \"The Message\", \"Everything\" and \"Keep Your Love\".\n\nThe single \"Rockin' My Body\" reached number 31 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 1987 he became the first South Asian to earn the Grandmaster title.\n\nMurshed was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to Manzur Murshed and Najma Ahmed. He picked up the game from his older brother. His neighbor was Jamilur Rahman, who later became a national champion himself. These favorable conditions may have contributed to the young Murshed's devotion to chess. Murshed passed his SSC exam in 1983 from St. Joseph High School and HSC exam in 1985 from Dhaka College.. There is also another famous Bangladeshi named Neaz Murshed (Da Nefarius) who resides in Qatar and works in Honeywell, and is associated with other greats like Maaz Intezam bhai and Arjun Vs BD. He is not affiliated with the chess champion, Niaz Murshed.\n\nAs a nine-year-old, Murshed entered the preliminary rounds of the national chess championship. Although he failed to qualify, he left a lasting impression on all present. By the age of 12, he was considered one of the top players in Bangladesh. In 1978, he finished first in the national championship with two others, but ultimately placed third on a tie-breaker. He went on to win the next four national championships in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982. \n\nHe became the national champion again after 30 years in 2012. \n\nIn 1979, Murshed played in his first international competition at Kolkata, India. In 1981, placed second in the zonal tournament, held in Sharjah, UAE the same year, earning his International Master Title in the process. Later that year, he tied for first in the Asian Junior Championship, held in Dhaka, but was counted second on tiebreak since he had fewer wins (and losses) than Ricardo de Guzman (Philippines) who was awarded the title and automatic IM. Murshed participated in the 1982 World Junior Chess Championship, and although he failed to replicate his recent success, his game against Lars Schandorff of Denmark (later a grandmaster) was selected as the best game of the tournament. \n\nMurshed earned his first Grandmaster norm in 1984 due to his success in Bela Crkva Open, Yugoslavia (1983), Oakham School Youth Tournament (ahead of Nigel Short and Maxim Dlugy), Novag Commonwealth Chess Tournament 1984, Hong Kong 1984. He earned his second grandmaster norm in 1986, thanks to his solid performance in Capstain International Tournament, Dhaka (1985) and Calcutta Grandmasters Tournament, Calcutta (1986). In 1987, FIDE awarded him the Grandmaster title, making him the first GM in South Asia. \n\nUpon earning his bachelor's degree in economics, Murshed returned to chess. However, his playing declined when he found it hard to adapt to the new generation of information driven chess. Nonetheless, he still found success from time to time in the international scene: first in the Goodrich, India (1991), second in the GM Tournament, Cebu, Philippines (1992), third in the Doha Chess Festival, Qatar (1993), T-1st place with two other contestants in the zonal tournament (1993), and finally, T-2nd place in the Commonwealth Chess Championship in 2004.\n\nIn November 2009 he tied for 3rd–8th with Anton Filippov, Elshan Moradiabadi, Merab Gagunashvili, Alexander Shabalov and Vadim Malakhatko in the Ravana Challenge Tournament in Colombo\n\nHe played for Bangladesh in the Chess Olympiads of 1984, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2014.\n\nAfter earning his Grand Master title, Murshed went to the University of Pennsylvania to study economics. He played in only a handful chess tournaments during this time, but earned his bachelor's degree. \n\nMurshed plays primarily positional chess. He builds up small advantages, ultimately leading to a victory.\n\n"}

Wright Mills, in which Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the military, corporate, and political elements of society and suggests that the ordinary citizen is a relatively powerless subject of manipulation by those entities.\n\nThe book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, \"\", which examines the then-growing role of middle managers in American society. A main inspiration for the book was Franz Leopold Neumann's book \"\" in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like Germany. \"Behemoth\" had a major impact on Mills and he claimed that Behemoth had given him the \"tools to grasp and analyse the entire total structure and as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalist democracy\".\n\nAccording to Mills, the eponymous \"power elite\" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, \"the underlying populations of the world.\" The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) \"two or three hundred giant corporations\" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from \"a decentralized set of several dozen states\" and \"now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure,\" and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of \"distrust fed by state militia,\" but now an entity with \"all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain.\"\nortantly, and in distinction from modern American conspiracy theory, Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that \"often they are uncertain about their roles\" and \"without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Onecide.\" Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at eastern establishment universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. But, Mills notes, \"Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but which Harvard?\" Mills identifies two classes of Ivy League alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon fraternity or final club, such as Porcellian and Fly Club, and those who are not. Those so initiated, Mills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first established in elite private preparatory academies, where they are enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the mantle of the elite generally passes through families. \n\nThe resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: \n\nMills formulated a very short summary of his book: \"Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite.\"\n\nCommenting on \"The Power Elite\", Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. derisively said, \"I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again.\"\n\nAdolf Berle noted the book contained \"an uncomfortable degree of truth\", but Mills presented \"an angry cartoon, not a serious picture\". Dennis Wrong described \"The Power Elite\" as \"an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and moral indignation\".\n\nA review of the book in the \"Louisiana Law Review\" bemoaned that the \"practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current situation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial assertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable research\".\n\nNonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable over time. In 2006, G. William Domhoff wrote, \"Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago\". Mills' biographer, John Summers, admitted that \"The Power Elite\" was \"vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering\" but declared that its historical value \"seems assured\". In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his proposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi (2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The Causes of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars.\n\nIn 2017, episode 5 of the Netflix TV series \"Mindhunter\" contains a scene in which one of the main characters, a sociology PhD student Deborah \"Debbie\" Mitford, writes a paper on \"The Power Elite\".\n\nIn the Noah Baumbach film \"While We're Young\", the protagonist Josh Schrebnick is a documentarian who cites Mills, and frequently cites the expertise of the subject of his documentary, Ira Mandelstam's views as they relate to \"The Power Elite\".\n\n"}

His father, Israel Minor, was a merchant who made a large fortune in the pharmaceutical business. As a young man, Robert Minor worked as a bookkeeper in New York City but decided to study art in his early thirties. After studying in New York with painter Alfred Cornelius Howland, Minor went abroad in 1871 to continue his artistic education. He visited various galleries in England before traveling to Barbizon, France, where he studied under Diaz. He later studied in Antwerp under Joseph Van Luppen and Hippolyte Boulenger. In 1874, he was vice president of the Société artistique et littéraire of Antwerp.\n\nOn his return to the United States in 1874, he opened a studio in New York. He painted for many years out of his studio in the Old University Building of New York University. Painting in the Adirondack Mountains and later in Waterford, Connecticut, Minor soon became known for his landscapes resembling the Barbizon School. Under the influence of George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant, he also began to paint in a Tonalist style. His painting \"Great Silas at Night\" (1897) displays his adoption of the Tonalist style while his lingering Barbizon style can be seen in \"A Hillside Pasture\". From the 1890s until his death, Minor exhibited frequently with the Tonalists in New York. In 1897, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Design, New York. In 1900, Minor achieved the height of his success at the historic William T. Evans sale in 1900, where his painting \"The Close of Day\" (private collection) fetched $3,050, the highest price for a landscape by a living American painter at that auction.\n\nOver the course of his lifetime, Minor was a member of the Society of American Artists and the Salmagundi Club. He exhibited in New York, Brooklyn, Chicago, and elsewhere in the United States, as well as in the Royal Academy of London and the salons of Paris and Antwerp. Minor was plagued with bad health during the last decade of his life, decreasing the quantity and likely the quality of his works. He died at his home in Waterford, Connecticut, on 4 August 1904. His paintings are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Mead Art Museum, the Lyman Allyn Museum, the Florence Griswold Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Newark Museum, the Robert Hull Fleming Museum, the Haggin Museum, the Salmagundi Club, the Memorial Art Gallery, and the University of Arizona Museum of Art.\nHis paintings are characteristic of the Barbizon school and Tonalism, and he was particularly happy in his sunset and twilight effects; but it was only within a few years of his death that he began to have a vogue among collectors.

Emphasis is laid on efficient support for array processing via data parallelism. Efficiency concerns are essentially twofold. On the one hand, efficiency in program development is to be improved by the opportunity to specify array operations on a high level of abstraction. On the other hand, efficiency in program execution, i.e. the runtime performance of programs, in time and memory consumption, is still to be achieved by sophisticated compilation schemes. Only as far as the latter succeeds, the high-level style of specifications can actually be called useful.\n\nTo facilitate compiling to efficiently executable code, certain functional language features which are not considered essential for numerical applications, e.g. higher-order functions, polymorphism, or lazy evaluation, are not (yet) supported by SAC.

It is the seventh verse of the Sermon on the Mount, and also seventh of what are known as the Beatitudes.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe New International Version translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:9.\n\nThe word \"peacemakers\" does not imply pacifism, unlike later sections of the sermon. It does not refer to those who do not fight, but those who actively bring conflict to an end. Hill notes that \"peacemakers\" is a rarely used word in the period, and that it was most commonly used to refer to Roman Emperors who had brought peace. As such this verse formed the heart of St. Augustine's argument in favour of just war, arguing that a war that brought about greater peace was justified. Clark notes that the first century was in the middle of the Pax Romana and actual wars were rare and that the verse may have referred to disputes within the community, rather than actual wars. Hare agrees that this verse isn't praise of the Pax Romana, but rather a reflection that the Roman forces had not brought harmony or cooperation and that such things were impossible to impose by force.\n\nWhat precisely the author of Matthew was advocating in this verse is unclear. Davies and Allison note that it can be read as supporting those who are at peace with God, but they state that most scholars believe it more likely refers to those who are reconciled with other people, a theme which recurs in Matthew. Boring believes this verse is a rejection of the proto-Zealots and a defence of why the Christian community did not participate in the Great Jewish Revolt.\n\nMartin Luther and other early Protestant translators of the Bible preferred the translation \"children of God,\" because they wanted to avoid any confusion as to whether Jesus was the only Son of God. \"Sons of God\" is, however, the more accurate translation and is used by most modern Bible translations. In several places the Gospel makes clear that the population in general can be called sons of God and Jesus frequently refers to God as \"our Father\" or \"your Father.\"\n\nOther than \"blessed are the meek\" in this is perhaps the most famous of the Beatitudes. It was the personal motto of James I of England, and has been used by a number of other groups and organizations. In \"The Canterbury Tales\" \"The Tale of Melibee\" this verse is one of the main themes. The Beatitude is quoted three times by Shakespeare, but each time ironically. It appears a 2.1.25 of \"Henry VI, part 2\", 2.1.50-3 of \"Richard III\", and 5.3.138-40 of \"Coriolanus\". The verse also plays an important role in Herman Melville's \"Billy Budd\". The verse appears on John Marston's grave in the video game Red Dead Redemption. This verse was famously misprinted in the second edition of the Geneva Bible as \"blessed are the placemakers.\" This was parodied in Monty Python's \"Life of Brian\" where the crowd listening to the sermon mishears it as \"blessed are the cheesemakers\" and then begin to debate the meaning of the phrase.\n"}

This experience may be responsible for much of the skill Mohr later showed in devising instruments and methods of chemical analysis.

Visiting employees of the Japanese postal insurance division brought samples of the exercises from the US back to Japan. The exercises were widely used to improve the health of Japanese soldiers both at home and abroad during the 1930s and 1940s.

The first recorded observations of them are thought to have been telescopic observations by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Although the extreme crescent phase of Venus has since been observed with the naked eye, there are no indisputable historical pre-telescopic records of it being described or known.\n\nThe orbit of Venus is 224.7 Earth days. The phases of Venus result from the planet's orbit around the Sun inside the Earth's orbit giving the telescopic observer a sequence of progressive lighting similar in appearance to the Moon's phases. It presents a \"full\" image when it is on the opposite side of the Sun. It shows a \"quarter phase\" when it is at its maximum elongation from the Sun. Venus presents a \"thin crescent\" in telescopic views as it comes around to the near side between the Earth and the Sun and presents its \"new phase\" when it is between the Earth and the Sun. Since the planet has an atmosphere it can be seen at \"new\" in a telescope by the halo of light refracted around the planet. The full cycle from \"new\" to \"full\" to \"new\" again takes 584 days (the time it takes Venus to overtake the Earth in its orbit). The planet also changes in apparent size from 9.9 arc seconds at \"full\" (superior conjunction) up to a maximum of 68 arc seconds at \"new\" (inferior conjunction). Venus reaches its greatest magnitude of −4.5 when it is an intermediate crescent shape at the point in its orbit, when it is 68 million km away from the Earth (a combination of its closeness and the fact that it is 28% illuminated).\n\nThe official first observations of the full planetary phases of Venus were by Galileo at the end of 1610 (though not published until 1613 in the \"Letters on Sunspots\"). Using a telescope, Galileo was able to observe Venus going through a full set of phases, something prohibited by the Ptolemaic system. (The Ptolemaic system would never allow Venus to be fully lit from the perspective of the Earth, as this would require it to be on the far side of the Sun, which is impossible if Venus's orbit in its entirety is between the Earth and the Sun, as the Ptolemaic system requires). This observation essentially ruled out the Ptolemaic system, and was compatible only with the Copernican system and the Tychonic system and other heliocentric models such as the Capellan and Riccioli's extended Capellan model.\n\nThere is some controversy about Galileo's claim to first observing the phases of Venus: In December of 1610, Galileo received a letter from fellow scientist Benedetto Castelli, asking if the phases of Venus were observable through Galileo's new telescope. Days later, Galileo wrote in a letter to Johannes Kepler saying that he had observed Venus going through phases, but took complete credit for himself. It is unclear, lacking copies of any earlier correspondence, whether Castelli was telling Galileo of it for the first time, or responding to Galileo having previously informed him of it.\n\nCuriously, Galileo's letter to Kepler was encrypted so that Kepler could not scoop Galileo before he had made more exhaustive observations: Galileo took a sentence stating that Venus went through phases:\n\nAnd scrambled the letters into a strange anagram:\n\nCynthia was a popular epithet for the moon, the mother of love of course being Venus. He sent the anagram to Kepler, then a few months later sent the decoded version. This way he had proof of having made the observation, without Kepler being able to publish it earlier. This technique of hiding encoded announcements in letters was not uncommon at the time.\n\nThe extreme crescent phase of Venus can be seen without a telescope by those with exceptionally acute eyesight, at the limit of human perception. The angular resolution of the naked eye is about 1 minute of arc. The apparent disk of Venus' extreme crescent measures between 60.2 and 66 seconds of arc, depending on the distance from Earth. \n\nMesopotamian priest-astronomers described Ishtar (Venus) in cuneiform text as \"having horns\" which has been interpreted as indicating observation of a crescent. However, other Mesopotamian deities were depicted with horns, so the phrase could have been simply a symbol of divinity.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"municipi\" collectively comprise the comune of Rome, which is itself one of the constituent parts of the wider metropolitan city of Rome Capital.\n\nOn 31 March 1966, for administrative purposes and to increase decentralization, the territory of the \"comune\" of Rome was divided into 12 administrative areas, called \"circoscrizioni\" (singular: \"circoscrizione\"). On 11 February 1972 those areas were increased to 20.\n\nOn 6 March 1992, after the referendum that ratified the separation of the then \"Circoscrizione XIV\" from Rome and the birth of the new independent \"comune\" of Fiumicino, the number of administrative areas of Rome decreased to 19.\n\nOn 19 January 2001, \"circoscrizioni\" which were renamed \"municipi\" and the direct election of a President to head each \"municipio\" wa established.\n\nOn 11 March 2013, Rome City Council decided to merge some of the \"municipi\", reducing their number to 15 and giving them a new numeration.\n\nFor the current legislature (2016–2021), presidents of Rome's \"municipi\" are:\nThe \"comune\" of Rome is also composed of 155 urban zones (\"zone urbanistiche\"), conceived as a subdivision of the \"municipi\", which were established in 1977 for statistical and city planning purposes on the basis of urban homogeneity criteria.

In the Renaissance, under Pope Sixtus V, they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under Pope Benedict XIV in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under Napoleon was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870 when Rome became the capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the Aurelian Walls. In 1874 a fifteenth rione, Esquilino, was created on the newly urbanised zone of Monti. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati – the only one outside the Walls of Pope Urban VIII – in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the \"historical city\" (\"Centro Storico\").\n\nThere are currently 6 \"suburbi\" with a discontinuous numbering, since some of the original suburbs were established as \"quartieri\" in 1961, following to the urban development of the city.\n"}

The game follows on from both the events of \"Heroes of Might and Magic III\" (a prequel to \"Blood and Honor\"), and those of \"\". Players form a party of four characters who win a castle in a scavenger hunt and soon become embroiled in political events on the continent of Antagarich, in the world of Enroth, before eventually choosing one of two paths and working alongside a number of characters, whose storyline continues on from the events of \"\". The game, \"\" is a sequel to \"Blood and Honor\".\nWhile much of the gameplay remains the same as it was in \"Mandate of Heaven\", a few improvements and changes were made to a number of prominent parts of the game. Character creation in \"Blood and Honor\" received an update from its predecessor by now allowing players to choose a race for each character out of the following four - Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Goblins - while also adding in three new classes to choose from alongside the pre-existing ones - Thief, Monk and Ranger. The skill system also received a major change, with the inclusion of new skills and a new level of expertise - Grandmaster - but also becoming more restrictive than that of the previous title; a character's class not only determines what skills they can learn but now also puts a cap on the level of expertise it can be trained to, meaning that while a Thief could become a Master of the Sword Skill, a Knight can train the skill up to Grandmaster. The change to the skill system, also affects the Magic system of the game, in that while some spells have been removed and new ones included, a character's level of expertise in a school of magic determines what spells can be learned, with weaker spells gaining more bonuses upon training to higher levels of expertise; an example of this new system comes with the \"Fly\" spell, which only Masters of Air magic can learn, but who can gain the benefit of not draining magic points upon attaining Grandmaster of Air. Along with these changes, the game includes an update to the graphical appearances of enemy sprites, character models and items.\n\nBeside the changes, the game features new additions. The first is the inclusion of making two notable choices, in regards to the political conflict between the elves and humans within the story. While one choice encountered is entirely optional but can determine the fate of their party's realm if completed within a set time limit, the other has a more profound impact on the story and is mandatory; the player has to make a decision on this choice in order to progress in the game's story. This ultimate choice, in regards to finding a successor to Harmondale's Arbiter (the game's version of the Seer from the previous title), defines which path - Light or Dark - the party takes for the rest of the game, affecting certain aspects. Along with a minor but permanent change of colour on the game display (white for Light, black for Dark), a number of additional quests become available for their chosen alignment, while the city of that respective path is friendly to the party and their rival is not; if Light is chosen, guards in all Darkness-aligned towns become hostile towards the player and vice versa. One major noticeable effect of this choice comes down to the Promotion quest system; while characters can earn a promotion to a more advanced tier of their chosen class without taking a path, proceeding to the second and final tier does requires such a choice, effectively leaving such promotions unavailable until later in the game, while determining what sort of quest they get in order to earn it and the title they receive as a result. For example, a Paladin who becomes a Crusader can later become either a Hero if they choose the Light path or a Villain if they chose the Dark path.\n\nThe other major addition to the game is the minigame of Arcomage, which is tied into two side-quests, in which players have to obtain a set of Arcomage cards and then play the game in all of the taverns in Antagarich. When playing the minigame, both sides having their towers pre-set to a certain height, are given a wall, and then achieve one of two specific victory conditions set out by each tavern: either get a tower to a certain height, or destroy your opponent's tower. Players take turns to either play a card, or discard it, until one side achieves victory via one of the conditions set out.\n\nThe game takes place in the world of Enroth, across the continent of Antagarich. The continent is divided up into several regions, including the elven lands of Avlee and Tularean Forest, the barrens of Deyja which house the necromancer stronghold of The Pit, the swamps and snow-capped mountains of Tatalia, the Bracada desert and the cloud city of Celeste, Mount Nighon, the islands of Emerald Isle and Evernmorn, the dwarven lands of the Barrow Downs, the human kingdom of Erathia, and the realm of Harmondale. By the time the game starts, the aftermath of the war in Heroes of Might and Magic III has led the elves of Avlee and the humans of Erathia in a political dispute on the boundaries of Harmondale, with tensions slowly increasing.\n\nFollowing the events of , the eight heroes of Terra - Sir Caneghem, Crag Hack, Maximus, Resurrectra, Dark Shade, Kastore, Robert the Wise and Tolberti - attempted to pilot a seedship known as the \"Lincoln\" in pursuit of the Guardians, Corak and Sheltem, who were en route for the world of Xeen. However, an unknown problem occurred that caused the Terrans to drift off-course and eventually crash-land in the seas near Antagarich, on Enroth. At around the same time, two war parties, one of elves and the other of goblins, break off fighting each other when the eight heroes emerge from the sea in strange outfits. Both sides witness the heroes arguing over their mission before eventually splitting up into two separate parties and departing. While elves report what they saw to their leader, Gavin Magnus, the Immortal King of Celeste, the goblins report the same thing to Archibald Ironfist, the brother of King Roland and leader of the Necromancers of Deyja after forging an alliance with them shortly after fleeing from Enroth, when the adventurers of , taking residence in Antagarich to plan his next move. Intrigued with what they hear, the pair order a search for the strange beings.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Emerald Isles, the wealthy Lord Markham organises a scavenger hunt, with first prize being the deeds to the Castle of Harmondale and its surrounding lands. A new party of four player characters takes up the challenge and wins the competition, becoming the new Lords of Harmondale, only to discover upon arriving to their new home that the castle fell into a dreadful state of dilapidation. After clearing out some unwelcome guests, and getting help from Hothfarr IX, king of the dwarves of Stone City, to repair their castle, the new Lords soon return to their restored castle only to find diplomats waiting for them, each representing either the human kingdom of Erathia or the elven kingdom of Avlee and asking the party to meet each kingdom's leader: King Eldrich Parson, leader of the elves of Avlee, and Queen Catherine Ironfist, leader of the humans of Erathia. Through them, the party learn why Markham was offering Harmondale as a prize; unbeknown to them, their new home lay in disputed territory that both Avlee and Erathia had laid a claim on, and has now resulted in both battles between both kingdoms, despite the efforts of an Arbiter in the matter, Judge Grey.\n\nHaving noticed that Castle Harmondale had been restored by the party, both Catherine and Eldrich each asks them to help in their dispute against the other by performing a feat of espionage that can gain them an advantage. The party find themselves either doing so within a period of a month, or letting their rival know of what they were asked to do. Eventually a major fight between the two kingdoms erupts in the Tularen Forest over who gets to take an important artifact - Gryphonheart's Trumpet. In managing to get it before the conflict ends (if the player arrives in time to learn of the battle), the party face the decision of handing it over to one of the leaders, granting that kingdom victory in the conflict, or pass it on to Grey, thus granting Harmondale independence from both kingdoms. A few months after the war began, Judge Grey passes away from natural causes, leaving the party to find a suitable candidate. Faced to decide between either Judge Fairweather, a representative of the wizards of Bracada, or Judge Sleen, a representative of the necromancers of Deyja, the party's choice eventually decides on the outcome of the war. If Judge Sleen is chosen, the war worsens and the necromancers use the corpses of the fallen to make an undead army, but if Judge Fairweather is chosen, the humans and elves come to a peaceful agreement and thus end their war over Harmondale. Following this, the party go the city of their chosen \"path\" and meet with that city's leader, finding themselves undertaking a trial before meeting with their four advisers. Upon completing the trial, they soon find themselves working on a series of tasks for the advisers, who eventually reveal themselves as off-worlders and the Terrans that arrived on Enroth.\n\nWhat was witnessed by the war parties of elves and goblins was not the full story - when the Terrans emerged from the sea, they soon fell into disagreement over their mission. While Resurrectra, Robert the Wise, Crag Hack and Sir Caneghem, wanted to build a forgotten Gate created by the Ancients, capable of allowing them to reach the two warring Guardians and perhaps even the enigmatic Ancients themselves, the others, Kastore, Tolberti, Dark Shade and Maximus, wanted to revive the Ancients' broken Heavenly Forge, capable of creating futuristic weaponry beyond compare, and use it to conquer Enroth. Eventually, the two groups separated into two parties - one \"good\" and one \"evil\" - and began exploring Antagarich, but not before each party set up a trap on the \"Lincoln\" to prevent the other side from gaining control over it. While Kastore led the \"evil\" party and eventually secured places in Deyja beside Archibald in order to continue to research a way to revive the Forge, Resurrectra led the \"good\" party and formed an alliance with Gavin in order to complete the Gate, with both finding that needed champions to get control of the seedship and recover an important device known as Oscillation Overthruster, to complete their instrument of victory.\n\nBefore the party can retrieve the device needed by Resurrectra/Kastore, they first find themselves having do battle against the diabolical Kreegans (the devil-like race that featured in ) and eliminate their monarch, Xenofex. Travelling the Land of the Giants, the party soon receive a message from Archibald upon arrival, informing them that (regardless of their alignment) Kastore deposed him and took control of the Necromancers. Having become weary and guilt-ridden for his past crimes, he asks the players to enter the Kreegan's fortress and rescue Roland, in the hopes it will lift a death sentence put on him by Catherine. Rescuing Roland and defeating Xenofex, the party watch as the Ironfists reunite, before Archibald renounces his claim to Enroth's throne and departs in peace (which leads on into ).\n\nWith the Kreegan dealt a blow, the party soon receive wetsuits from Resurrectra/Kastore, and venture into the \"Lincoln\" battling droids and finally retrieving the Osciliation Overthruster. The story ends depending on the party's chosen alignment. If Light, Resurrectra's party uses the Overthruster to complete the Gate, thus being transported to a neighbouring space station where the party meets Corak (that is, a second C.O.R.A.K. module Guardian - another appeared throughout Might and Magic -) who reveals the nature of the Ancients' war. If dark, Kastore's party uses it to revive the Heavenly Forge, thus producing an endless supply of futuristic weaponry capable of dominating the world.

Unlike the previous two games, however, \"Might and Magic VIII\" introduces a new party management system that allows all but one of the five possible player characters to be hired, dismissed or re-hired at any time during gameplay. The character class system used in the previous two games has similarly been overhauled, with only the cleric and knight classes remaining.

Throughout the course of the storyline, the player is given opportunities to side with either dragons or dragon hunters, and either sun priests or necromancers. This choice is permanent and affects several quests, NPC reactions and available recruitable characters. However, unlike its prequel, the game's ending sequence is not affected by the outcome of these choices.\n\n\"Might and Magic VIII\" takes place on the fictional world of Enroth, upon the continent of Jadame, and acts as a sequel to \"\" and \"\". Over a thousand years ago, the interstellar war between the Ancients and the Kreegan drove both races off of one of the Ancients' many colony worlds. During the millennium since, the original colonists and natives of that world built their own society and culture from the ruin, the stories of the Ancients and the Kreegan having long since passed into legend. Ten years ago, as depicted in \"\", the Kreegan invaded the world. The heroes of \"Might and Magic VI\" destroyed the Kreegan Queen, and the last of the Kreegan were wiped out over the course of \"Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia\", \"\" and \"Heroes III: Armageddon's Blade\". The Ancients, however, anticipating disaster should the Kreegan manage to gain a foothold on the world, had already enacted a scorched earth plan: rather than let the world fall into the hands of their ancient enemies, they would see it destroyed outright.\n\nA servant of the Ancients, the planeswalker Escaton, arrives in the village of Ravenshore on the continent of Jadame. Approaching the center of town, he summons a giant crystal which unleashes an elemental storm across the continent. There is widespread destruction and the boundaries to the four Elemental Planes are breached. Now elementals and monsters from beyond the boundaries are threatening to invade, fulfilling Escaton's plan to draw the powers of the elements toward the crystal and destroy the world, and the player must assemble a party of heroes to prevent this.\n\nThe game features several recurring characters from previous titles in the series, including the Elemental Lords from , the Ironfists from Heroes of Might and Magic, and the necromancers Sandro and Thant from Heroes of Might and Magic III.\n\nThe continent of Jadame is first introduced in this game, previously unmentioned in the series. The four elemental gateways appear in the four corners of Jadame: the Gateway of Earth on one of the Dagger Wound Islands (southeast), the Gateway of Water in Ravage Roaming (southwest), the Gateway of Air in the Murmurwoods (northwest), and the Gateway of Fire in the Ironsand Desert (northeast). In each case they cause an environmental disaster: a volcano in the Dagger Wound Island chain erupts and the tremors destroy the bridges that link the islands, the minotaur undercity in Ravage Roaming is flooded, the trees in a large area of the Murmurwoods are uprooted by the winds, and much of the troll settlement in Ironsand is destroyed by an explosion of fire. Escaton raised an enormous crystal in the centre of the city of Ravenshore, which acts as the portal to the Plane Between Planes, where the Destroyer resides.\n\nThe first character created by the player remains with the party for the entire game and is referred to as the \"Acknowledged Champion of Jadame\". This character leads the party through the adventures in the game.\n\n\n\"Might and Magic VIII\" was released to a generally average reception, and was regarded by many critics as surprisingly inferior to previous titles in the series, though still a passable game. \"IGN\" praised the game's rendered cutscenes, storyline, setting and background along with its overall consistency and expansion on the \"Might and Magic\" universe, noting these as particularly strong points, but was disappointed with in-game graphics and the reused engine's low modern capabilities, citing these as pitiful compared to other, more modern RPGs.\n\nThis was echoed by \"GameSpot\" reviewer, who, though intrigued by the series' addictive charm, was displeased with \"Might and Magic VIII\"'s tedious interface and pointed out the imbalance of the dragon character class. Game Revolution's reviewer was dissatisfied with the plot, particularly in comparison to earlier titles, and felt the game was identical to both its prequels.\n\nKevin Rice reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"This isn't the bottom of the barrel in RPG gaming, but you can see the bottom from here.\"\n\nIn Japan, the game was ported by Imagineer for the PlayStation 2 under the title . The game has just a few minor changes. Before this port, the last game in the main series to appear on a console was , almost ten years previously.\n\n"}

Development started in September 1942 in response to United States Army Air Forces requirement for a fighter possessing an extremely high rate of climb, using the most powerful liquid-cooled engine then available, the Allison V-3420. The program was cancelled after only a small number of prototypes and production aircraft had been completed, as it was no longer required in its original role, could not be quickly deployed, and possessed no significant advantages over aircraft already in production.\n\nIn October 1942, the contract for two prototypes, designated \"XP-75\", was signed with the Fisher Body Division of GM. The design concept was to use the outer wing panels from the North American P-51 Mustang, the tail assembly from the Douglas A-24 (SBD), and the undercarriage from the Vought F4U Corsair in a general layout much as in the Bell P-39 Airacobra with the engine located with the contra-rotating propellers driven through extension shafts. At an early design stage, however, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk outer wing panels were substituted for the P-51 panels.\n\nIn mid-1943, the need for long-range escort fighters became more urgent than fast climbing interceptors so a decision was made to order six more XP-75 airplanes modified for the long-range role. At this time, an order for 2,500 production aircraft was also let, but with the stipulation that if the first P-75A was not satisfactory the complete order might be canceled.\n\nAt the time, General Motors was busy in several projects towards the war effort, including the mass production of several different aircraft types, among them the Grumman TBF Avenger. Some sources claim that the P-75 was the result of a scheme to get General Motors out of being forced to build Boeing B-29 Superfortresses; the P-75 project being a \"high-priority\" project to help GM avoid the added strain of Superfortress production. Bearing the name, \"P-75 Eagle\" was significant as the designation harkened back to the French 75 gun in World War I, considered a symbol of defeating the Germans. The \"Eagle\" was given extensive media coverage prior to its first flight, being trumpeted as a \"wonder plane\".\n\nPowered by a V-3420-19 24-cylinder engine rated at 2,600 hp driving co-axial contra-rotating propellers, the XP-75 flew for the first time on 17 November 1943. The second XP-75 flew shortly thereafter, with all six long-range XP-75s entering the test program by the spring 1944. The test program brought up numerous teething problems, including miscalculation of the fighter's center of mass, failure of the engine to produce its expected power, inadequate engine cooling, high aileron forces at high speed, and poor spin characteristics. Redesigns were introduced into the long-range XP-75s including a modified tail assembly, new \"bubble\" canopy, and a V-3420-23 engine that corrected most of the deficiencies by the time the first P-75A Eagles entered flight testing in September 1944.\n\nBy this time, the Army Air Forces had decided to limit the number of combat aircraft types in production and not enter into large-scale production of new types that might not be available before the war ended. As the twin-engine Lockheed P-38 Lightning and North American P-51 Mustang demonstrated excellent long-range capabilities, the production run of the P-75A Eagle was subsequently terminated on 6 October 1944. It was decided to use the six completed production aircraft for experimental work and development of the V-3420 engine. As a result of those events, the P-75A did not complete formal performance trials due to termination of the production contract. Ultimately, only eight XP-75s and six P-75As were built.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2180069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180069", "title": "Halton-with-Aughton", "text": "Halton-with-Aughton\n\nHalton-with-Aughton is a civil parish and electoral ward located east of Lancaster, England, on the north bank of the River Lune. The main settlement is the village of Halton, or Halton-on-Lune, in the west, and the parish stretches to the hamlet of Aughton in the east. It lies in the City of Lancaster district of Lancashire, and has a population of 2,227, down from 2,360 in 2001.\n\nHalton consists primarily of modern housing, amongst which can be found a number of 17th- and 18th-century buildings. It has a primary school and there is a post office and other local amenities including a very successful community centre. The village is on the edge of the new Heysham to M6 Link Road.\n\nHalton railway station was on the opposite bank of the river from the village, linked by a narrow toll bridge. The station closed in 1966, but the station building and part of one platform survive beside the cycle path along the disused \"little\" North Western Railway.\n\nHalton was the centre of important Anglo-Saxon manor held by Earl Tostig, the brother of King Harold before the Norman Conquest. Count Roger of Poitou who held the fee after the regime change, and his successors, preferred Lancaster.\n\nThe 19th-century textile mills once harnessed the power of the Lune. Earthworks on Castle Hill show evidence of an 11th-century Norman motte and bailey castle. In the churchyard of St Wilfrid's Church stands the Halton Cross believed to have been carved by Norsemen over 1,000 years ago.\n\nHalton Castle was situated within the village of Halton. It is likely that a motte and bailey castle was constructed on the site in the late 11th century. However Halton's prominence was lost in the 12th century when favour shifted to Lancaster, and Halton Castle was abandoned. Only earthworks now remain and it is privately owned with no public right of way.\nHalton Hall was part of the Manor of Halton and stood for several centuries on the banks of the River Lune before being demolished in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1752 a charcoal blast furnace was erected on the Cote Beck, where the M6 motorway crosses Foundry Lane, and by 1755 the Halton Furnace Company ran it with those at Leighton and Caton Forge. The furnaces produced pig iron. The chamber was charged with charcoal, limestone, and ore and a blast of air was blown into the base using water driven bellows. The molten iron (1530 C) ran down the furnace and was intermittently released in to the 'pig bed' of sand. It could produce 20 tons of pig iron a week- working for several weeks at a time. The 3-5% carbon pig iron was then decarburised in forges and purified in a finery forge to remove carbon and silicon in a process that used a trip hammer. In the chafery the metal was reheated and shaped with a trip hammer into an malleable iron bar. There were two forges on the river in Halton- the upper forge had six water-wheels, two fineries and two chaferies, the lower forge had a tilt and lift hammer. Coke furnaces had displaced most charcoal furnaces by 1800, though Halton hung on until 1845 servicing local need. Nothing remains to be seen.\n\nThere was intensive industrial activity on the river bank in the 18th century with the forges and the construction of two water powered cotton mills: Forse Bank mill (1744) and Low Mill. Little to nothing now remain. Forse Bank mill whose name morphed into Forge Bank Mill was upstream. Water was taken from above the weir and two parallel leets powered all the buildings. The mills have separate origins but eventually merged. Forse bank started spinning flax, in 1821 it was spinning cotton but in 1826 it was flax. Other buildings, including a forge were acquired and converted. After the Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1861, the spinning stopped - but in 1862 it was producing oilcloth, thus weaving. Eventually it was purchased by Williamson, who moved linoleum and oilcloth manufacture to Lancaster. Cotton weaving stopped in 1941. Part of the site has been developed with rural town houses, which are not universally popular. Further development is currently stopped.\n\nIn 1849, the \"little\" North Western Railway built Halton station on the other bank of the Lune, primarily to serve the forge. During construction it was linked to Halton village by a ferry. Eight lives were lost when this capsized. In December 1849, the railway company built a toll bridge. It was washed away replaced in 1869 and replaced for the second time in 1913. When the railway closed in 1966, the bridge fell into disrepair, it has been restored and is now free and open to small cars, pedestrians and cycles. The original timber station was destroyed by fire on 3 April 1907. A spark from the engine of a passing Heysham– boat train set fire to a wagon of oil drums by the goods shed. The fire brigade were unable to cross the narrow bridge and it was left to a special trainload of railway workers from Lancaster to pass buckets of water from the river. The station was rebuilt in brick and timber and the building survives to this day, used as storage by Lancaster University Rowing Club, with a public car park occupying the former track bed. The bridge is on National Cycle Network Route 90, and the trackbed on Route 69.\n\nAughton () was known as 'Actun' in the 1086 Domesday Book, meaning a place where oak trees grow. A riverside hamlet by the River Lune, Aughton consists mainly of stone cottages and St Saviour's Church, which is located on Aughton Road to the north of the hamlet. The church was built in 1864 and designed by architect E. G. Paley. Aughton lies within the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\n\nEvery 21 years the gigantic Aughton Pudding is baked over a celebratory weekend. The pudding made in 1992 was entered into the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as the largest, but the festival itself was run at a loss. The festival in 2013 was a great success. No world record was attempted but the attendance was over 5000 and the profit made divided between good causes, St Saviour's and the Recreation Rooms. This money was later loaned to Broadband 4 Rural North to bring broadband to the village on 14 August 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2180073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180073", "title": "Smalls Lighthouse", "text": "Smalls Lighthouse\n\nSmalls Lighthouse stands on the largest of a group of wave-washed basalt and dolerite rocks known as The Smalls approximately west of Marloes Peninsula in Pembrokeshire, Wales, and west of Grassholm. It was erected in 1861 by engineer James Douglass to replace a previous lighthouse which had been erected in 1776 on the same rock. It is the most remote lighthouse operated by Trinity House.\n\nThe original Smalls Lighthouse was erected between 1775 and 1776, to the plans of Liverpool musical-instrument maker Henry Whiteside. It stood on nine oak pillars, allowing the sea to pass through beneath. Although it suffered from some rocking, it stood for 80 years. During its life a significant number of extra struts were added beyond the original nine. The pillar-based design has since been used successfully in many maritime structures.\n\nWhen Whiteside visited the lighthouse in 1777, he was stranded for a month by gales which showed no sign of abating so that supplies were almost exhausted. He wrote a message to a friend in St. David's placed in a bottle inside a casket with a note to the finder \"We doubt not but that whoever takes this up will be so merciful as to cause it to be sent to Thomas Williams, Esq, Trelithin, near St. David's, Wales\". Two days later it arrived almost outside the door of the addressee to whom it was duly delivered.\n\nThe old lighthouse brought about a change in lighthouse policy in 1801 after a gruesome episode, sometimes called the Smalls Lighthouse Tragedy. Thomas Howell and Thomas Griffith, the two-person team that managed the lighthouse, were publicly known to quarrel. When Griffith died in a freak accident, Howell feared that if he discarded the body into the sea, authorities might accuse him of murder. As Griffith's body began to decompose, Howell built a makeshift coffin for the corpse and lashed it to an outside shelf. Stiff winds blew the box apart, and the body's arm fell within view of the hut's window. As the winds would blow, gusts would catch the arm and move it in a way that made the appendage appear to beckon. In spite of his former partner's decaying corpse and working the lighthouse alone, Howell was able to keep the house's lamp lit. When Howell was finally relieved of duty, the impact of the situation was so emotionally taxing that his friends did not recognize him. As a result, the governing body changed the lighthouse policy to make lighthouse teams rosters of three people, which continued until the automation of British lighthouses in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1831 the tower was assaulted by a wave of such proportions that the floor of the keepers' room was torn up and slammed against the ceiling, injuring all the keepers, one so severely that he died. However the damage was repaired and the lighthouse survived another thirty years before it was replaced.\n\nIn 2011 the Smalls Lighthouse Tragedy was the subject of a B.B.C. radio play called \"The Lighthouse\", written by Alan Harris. The 2016 film \"The Lighthouse\", directed by Chris Crow, is also loosely based on the incident. Francis Lynch composed a chamber opera based on the incident, \"For Those in Peril\", which premiered on 9 February 2018 at St Matthew's Church in Evanston, Illinois. The 2019 film \"The Lighthouse\" by Robert Eggers was partly inspired by the tragedy.\n\nThe first stone of the new lighthouse tower was laid on 26 June 1857, Trinity House having bought out the previous leaseholders in 1836. The tower was completed in 1861.\n\nIn 1978 a helideck was erected above the lantern and in 1987 the lighthouse was automated. It is the first wind- and Solar-powered lighthouse in the U.K. Although it has only a 35-watt bulb, with the aid of lenses, this can be seen up to away. It was the first lighthouse in the country to have a flushing toilet installed.\n\nThe lighthouse's story was presented in the 2006 BBC Television programme \"Coast\", Series 1, episode \"Bristol to Cardigan Bay\". \n\nSmalls Lighthouse is important in the history of navigation. In 1837 the American Captain Thomas Hubbard Sumner discovered the concept of celestial position lines, the circle of equal altitude, as he was approaching Smalls Lighthouse in thick weather; they form the basis of nearly all modern celestial navigation and were sometimes called Sumner Lines.\n\n\n"}

All of this has inspired her to become a police officer, like her father who was slain in the line of duty years ago. Mary's ambition to this end amuses her siblings John and Vicky, as well as their widowed mother Celia.\n\nMary gets wind of a case involving the serial killer of several teenage girls, including a handful of her classmates. She launches her own investigation, which gets her in trouble with her late dad's partner, Detective Jerry Guinn (Bill Nunn). Guinn wants Mary as far away from the field as possible...ostensibly because she just doesn't have what it takes to be a cop, but also out of concern for her well-being. Undaunted, Mary enlists the aid of police cadet Tony Campbell (Kevin Dillon) to sniff out the murderer; gradually, the two fall in love. \n\nUltimately, the name \"Tony Campbell\" is revealed to be an alias; his real name is Daniel Henry Moffat, and he proves to be the killer both Mary and Guinn are looking for.

Reasons for the discount can range from the closure of a production company to a steep decline in an item's popularity in the aftermath of a fad or scandal. Another reason for the discount can be the particular product line being discontinued. The origin of the term comes from the fact such items would be found in an isolated bin rather than on store shelves. \n\nThe phrase \"bargain basement\" is now a synonym. \"Bargain basement\" used to be a literal basement in downtown department stores. Clearance merchandise would be placed there regardless of which section of the store it originally came from. \"Hutzler's Downstairs\", an outlet for discounted merchandise opened in the basement of Hutzler's Baltimore department store in September 1929, was an early example of bargain basements. During the Civil War, Hutzler's operated the country's first bargain counter at its Baltimore location. \"Bargain Basement\" was also used figuratively to describe the purchase of professional footballers from clubs in lower divisions by richer clubs for a low fee.\n\nIn more recent years, both terms have taken on a figurative meaning - most notably as a synonym for 'low-quality' or 'unimpressive'. The most common implication of an item's presence in a bargain bin is its low quality. \"Knock-offs\", for example, are associated with the term.\n\nThe term \"bargain bin\" is used in New Zealand, Australia, and some other countries to refer to a retailer whose primary function is to sell cheap goods (i.e., a variety store).\n\n"}

In the course of his career, South has wrestled for professional wrestling promotions such as Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nSouth began wrestling in 1984, having his first match on December 26, 1984 in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Teaming with Mike Allen at a CWF TV taping, the rookie lost to the Pretty Young Things (Koko B Ware and Norvell Austin). South next appeared in Mid South Wrestling, teaming with Rocky King to take on Kamala in a two on one match on January 2, 1985 in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nSouth next appeared in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). South made his debut on the April 6, 1985 edition of \"World Championship Wrestling\", the inaugural broadcast of the show after Jim Crockett acquired the TBS time slot. That night a young South teamed with Greg Stone to face Ivan Koloff & Krusher Kruschev (Barry Darsow). A week later he had his first singles match, losing to Magnum TA on the Saturday night program. On June 1, 1985 he received his first ever match (non-title) with then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair. He would become Ric Flair's favorite journeyman to wrestle as Flair considered him a great worker. South was used as enhancement talent but he always got in some offense and was very good at getting heel heat with the fans. He did however gain his first victory September 14, 1985 when he defeated Mack Jeffers in Columbus, Georgia. \n\nWhile still frequently wrestling in for Crockett, South also wrestled in Georgia Championship Wrestling and captured his NWA Georgia Junior Heavyweight Championship in 1986 in between stops for JCP. South also made appearances in NWA affiliate Central States Wrestling in the fall of 1986. In his first match there, he defeated Colt Steel on October 26 in Kansas City, Missouri, followed up by a win two days later against Mark Fleming. After a loss to Steel on November 21, 1986, South ended his run in CSW with another win over him on November 27, 1986 in Kansas City, Kansas. He then returned to Mid Atlantic Wrestling, where he began to frequently team with Gary Royal in the masked jobber tag teams the \"Cruel Connection\", \"Mexican Twin Devils\" and the \"Gladiators\". As the Gladiators, South and Royal jobbed for Bill and Randy Mulkey giving the perennial jobber tag team their only televised win on \"World Championship Wrestling\".\n\nIn the first round of the 1987 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup, South teamed with Steve Keirn and wrestled Mike Graham and Nelson Royal to a draw. Throughout the year he continued to team with Royal - usually as the Gladiators - and gained occasional victories in singles competition. In 1988 they were redubbed The Cruel Connection, and on April 22 entered the 1988 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup but lost to The Sheepherders in the first round.\n\nWhile still wrestling for Jim Crockett Promotions, South made his first World Wrestling Federation appearance on August 2, 1988 at a TV taping for \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\". He wrestled The Honky Tonk Man in a non-title match. On the August 24, 1988 taping of Challenge, South wrestled The Blue Blazer, the match being the masked Owen Hart's first televised WWF match. South would have matches with a wide area of WWF performers, including Brutus Beefcake, Jimmy Snuka, The British Bulldogs, Sam Houston, The Rockers, Rhythm & Blues, and The Ultimate Warrior. On August 2, 1989 he was defeated by Al Perez in the latter's debut match. His final appearance came on the January 20, 1990 episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\" where he teamed with Alan Martin to face Demolition.\n\nDuring the fall of 1988 Jim Crockett promotions was acquired by Ted Turner and ultimately rebranded World Championship Wrestling; during this time South continued as a regular. On April 1, 1989 South would lose to The Great Muta's WCW debut, and then enter a house show series with him that month. \n\nTwo months later he became part of wrestling history on Clash of the Champions VII. Teaming with Cougar Jay, he faced off against The Ding Dongs on June 14, 1989 in a match held in a sweltering Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Although new WCW Vice President Jim Herd was expecting a strong reaction for his new tag-team, the crowd turned virulently against them. While each Ding Dong took turns ringing a giant bell at ringside while the other wrestled, the crowd booed and announcer Jim Ross was noticeably embarrassed. South's opponents are now regarded as having one of the worst gimmicks of all time. \n\nGary Royal would depart WCW after 1989, leaving South to soldier on in singles matches wrestling under his own name or as \"Cruel Connection #1\". He faced a wave of incoming new talent, including Johnny B. Badd, Van Hammer, and Marcus Bagwell as the new decade progressed. After 1992 his appearances became infrequent. In August 20, 1993 when he teamed with The Italian Stallion to face The Cole Twins at a house show in Bluefield, West Virginia in what would be his only match of the year. In 1994 he returned for \"WCW Saturday Night\" matches against Alex Wright, Jim Duggan, and Dave Sullivan. In 1995 he would team with various opponents in matches against Stars & Stripes and The Nasty Boys. On May 27, 1995, just over ten years after joining the promotion he would have his last match when he teamed with Mike McKeefer in a \"WCW Saturday Night\" match that saw them defeated by The Nasty Boys.\n\nSouth returned for one match at a television taping on March 7, 1993 and faced Tatanka Fayetteville, North Carolina. However in 1994 he would make numerous appearances, starting on January 17 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\" where he was defeated by Tatanka in Richmond, Virginia. On February 5, 1994 episode of \"WWF Superstars\" he wrestled Doink the Clown, and in April faced Lex Luger in a losing effort. As the year progressed he would have matches with Sparky Plugg (Bob Holly and The Bushwhackers.\n\nGeorge South made one more WWF appearance in 1996, wrestling Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts on the June 1st edition of WWF Superstars. \n\nWhile still making appearances in WCW, South joined the Pro Wrestling Federation, a new promotion that was promoted by The Italian Stallion, who promoted the company with some help from South. On June 15, 1991 he captured the PWF Junior Heavyweight Championship. He would hold this title for 460 days before finally losing it to Flaming Youth on September 17, 1992. South would become the top heel in the PWF, winning the Junior Heavyweight title on multiple occassions. He also reformed his Cruel Connection team with Gary Royal when his former partner joined the promotion.\n\nSouth feuded with Flaming Youth and The Southern Rocker throughout 1993. On June 18, 1994 he teamed with the Italian Stallion and won the PWF Tag-Team Championship, defeating Austin Steele & Terry Austin. He would go on to win that title several times, but his greatest PWF achievement came on September 14, 1995 when he beat Star Ryder (Ray Hudson) to win the PWF Heavyweight Championship at an event in Charlotte, North Carolina. South would eventually have to vacate the title, and lost a tournament finale to crown a new champion October 21, 1995 to The Italian Stallion.\n\nIn 1996 he regained the PWF Heavyweight Championship and continued feud with the Stallion, as well as Carolina Dreamer. Stallion and South would trade the championship during 1996 and 1997.\n\nAs South continued his reign as a top heel wrestler in the PWF, he also made a foray into Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion in 1994. He made his debut on their October 15, 1994 television program, facing Tracy Smothers, then would wrestle Boo Bradley and Bruiser Bedlam later in the year. On January 2, 1995 he received a title shot against SMW TV Champion Buddy Landell in a \"Beat The Champ\" challenge but was unsuccessful. Later in the year he would face Al Snow, Unabom, and Bobby Blaze before leaving the promotion in April 1995.\n\nSouth is a born-again Christian and says one of his biggest thrills was passing a Christian tract to Hulk Hogan in WCW who told him he needed it. In 1999 three full-color cartoon tracts were produced for South entitled \"The Greatest Match Ever\", \"Who is Your Tag-Team Partner?\", and \"Who Are You Wrestling Against?\", illustrated by comics artist Steven Butler, packaged by The Nate Butler Studio, and published by PowerMark Productions.\n\nWhen the PWF closed in 1999, South opened his own promotion called the Exodus Wrestling Alliance. He still runs shows as of 2005 in the Mid-Atlantic area and participates in Christianity/wrestling shows with Nikita Koloff and Ted DiBiase.\n\nOne of his gimmicks is the fact that he gets heel heat from the fans by sticking his tongue out at them and taunting them about how he is manhandling their hero in the ring. He is proud of the fact that he does not have to get crude, use profanity, or become vulgar to get heel heat.\n\nAn important part of South's modern day matches are moves and performances intended to pay tribute to the great wrestling stars of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including Wahoo McDaniel, Blackjack Mulligan, Brute Bernard, Two Ton Harris, Paul Jones, Ricky Steamboat, Tully Blanchard, the Anderson Brothers, and others.\n\nSouth's most significant recent match was against Brad Armstrong in Spartanburg, South Carolina, at the Wrestling Night of Legends II. In 2013, South participated in the Brad Armstrong Memorial Event, in a tag-team match alongside Bob Orton Jr. against Tim Horner and Tom Prichard. During the match, Orton and South didn't get along too well to the point South tried to sucker-punch Orton, Orton would later enter the ring and superplex South, letting Horner pin South while Orton was walking down the ramp.\n\nIn 2018 he teamed with Zane Dawson at the NCWA's 10th Annual Ivan Koloff Tag Team Tournament and captured the NCWA Tag-Team Championship when his team defeated Chet Sterling and Dave Dawson. Later that year South joined the America's Most Liked Wrestling promotion, and on November 25, 1998 he defeated Caleb Konley to win the AMLW Title. South made several successful title defenses in 2019, including beating Konley in a loser leaves AML match on January 27 and defeating Fallah Bahh. CW Anderson finally ended South's title reign on July 28, 2019 at an event in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. However on December 1, 2019 he regained the title from Anderson and remains AML Champion as of March 2020.\n\nOver thirty years after the NWA Jim Crockett Promotion was purchased by Turner Broadcasting, George South made his first appearance back in the National Wrestling Alliance when he wrestled Colby Corino in dark match at \"NWA Powerrr\" on December 15, 2019.\n\nSouth trains up and comers at the Rings wrestling training facility in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesdays. His son, George South Jr., is also now a wrestler.\n\n\nAML World Champion (2 times)\n\n"}

At the time Robert Clivillés and David Cole frequently used this studio. Clivillés and Cole heard and liked Williams' baritone timbre and rhythmic flow and they recruited Williams to rap on \"Gonna Make You Sweat.\" Williams' rapping can be prominently heard on many of C+C's songs from their debut album, including \"Billboard\" Hot 100 No. 1 \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),\" as well as other major hits \"Here We Go (Let's Rock & Roll)\" and \"Things That Make You Go Hmmm...\" All three of those songs hit No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. According to C+C Music Factory founder Clivillés he and Cole had asked him in 1994 to work on new C+C Music Factory material but Williams refused.\n\nWilliams' solo debut, \"Freedom\" was released on June 1, 1993 on Columbia Records.

It is largely innervated by the greater petrosal nerve (a branch of the facial nerve); and its axons project to the lacrimal glands and nasal mucosa. The flow of blood to the nasal mucosa, in particular the venous plexus of the conchae, is regulated by the pterygopalatine ganglion and heats or cools the air in the nose. It is one of four parasympathetic ganglia of the head and neck, the others being the submandibular ganglion, otic ganglion, and ciliary ganglion.\n\nThe pterygopalatine ganglion (of Meckel), the largest of the parasympathetic ganglia associated with the branches of the maxillary nerve, is deeply placed in the pterygopalatine fossa, close to the sphenopalatine foramen. It is triangular or heart-shaped, of a reddish-gray color, and is situated just below the maxillary nerve as it crosses the fossa.\n\nThe pterygopalatine ganglion supplies the lacrimal gland, paranasal sinuses, glands of the mucosa of the nasal cavity and pharynx, the gingiva, and the mucous membrane and glands of the hard palate. It communicates anteriorly with the nasopalatine nerve.\n\nIt receives a sensory, a parasympathetic, and a sympathetic root.\n\nIts sensory root is derived from two sphenopalatine branches of the maxillary nerve; their fibers, for the most part, pass directly into the palatine nerves; a few, however, enter the ganglion, constituting its sensory root.\n\nIts parasympathetic root is derived from the nervus intermedius (a part of the facial nerve) through the greater petrosal nerve.\n\nIn the pterygopalatine ganglion, the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the greater petrosal branch of the facial nerve synapse with neurons whose postganglionic axons, vasodilator, and secretory fibers are distributed with the deep branches of the trigeminal nerve to the mucous membrane of the nose, soft palate, tonsils, uvula, roof of the mouth, upper lip and gums, and upper part of the pharynx. It also sends postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal nerve (a branch of the Ophthalmic nerve, also part of the trigeminal nerve) via the zygomatic nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve (from the trigeminal nerve), which then arrives at the lacrimal gland.\n\nThe nasal glands are innervated with secretomotor fibers from the nasal branches. Likewise, the palatine glands are innervated by the nasopalatine, greater palatine nerve and lesser palatine nerves. The pharyngeal nerve innervates pharyngeal glands. These are all branches of maxillary nerve.\n\nThe ganglion also consists of sympathetic efferent (postganglionic) fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. These fibers, from the superior cervical ganglion, travel through the carotid plexus, and then through the deep petrosal nerve. The deep petrosal nerve (carrying postganglionic sympathetics) joins with the greater petrosal nerve (carrying preganglionic parasympathetics) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal, which passes through the pterygoid canal before entering the ganglion. The Stellate Ganglion is at the bottom of the Cervical Sympathetic Chain. Fibers from the Stellate Ganglion (SG) pass up the chain to the Supeior Cervical Sympathetic Ganglion and into / through the Sphenopalatine Ganglion.\n\n\nBlockade of the ganglion with local anesthetic, clinically referred to as a ‘sphenopalatine ganglion block’ (SPG) may be performed transcutaneously with a small needle, or topically via the nose with local anesthetic soaked swabs. The topical SPG is used for treatment of persistent migraines and cluster headaches, demonstrating relief within 10-20 minutes. Increasingly the SPG is also used to treat post-dural-puncture headache (PDPH), and may be as effective as an epidural blood patch when used for PDPH.\n\nSelf-Administration of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Blocks with Cotton-Tipped Catheters with continual capillary feed is the most cost-effective method of treatment and has benefit of allowing patients to avoid visits to physicians and Emergeny Departments. After initial visit Self-Administered SPG Blocks (SASPGB) are less than $1.00 per application. Frequent repeated administration of SPG Blocks seem to increase effectiveness initially after which decreased frequency is required. Self-Administered SPG Blocks can be used to treat acute pain symptoms and prophylactically to reduce the onset of painful conditions and anxiety. SASPGB are extremely helpful for treatment of Migraines, Chronic Daily Headaches, Anxiety and TMJ Disorders. Sphenopalatine Ganglion Blocks and SASPGB are also effective for about 1/3 of cases of essential hypertension. \n\nThe Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block has been called \"The Miracle Block\" after publication of Albert Bengamin Gerber's book \"Miracles on Park Avenue\" the story of octogenerian ENT Dr. Milton Reder whose entire medical practice was based on SPG Blocks.\n\nThere are multiple new devices utilized for Neuromodulation of the Sphenopalatine Ganglion. There is one non-invasive device, a Myomonitor, an Ultra Low Frequency TENS (ULF-TENS) that has been utilized safely for over 50 years by neuromuscular dentists in the diagnosis and treatment of TMJ disorders and orofacial pain conditions. Spenopalatine Ganglion Neuromodulation (possible vagal nerve) is a fortunate secondary effect making it extremely effective for TMD. \n\n"}

He was related to the famous fabulist, Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695); and, belonging to a theatrical family, he was involved with the theatre from an early age. He died in Geneva, Switzerland on 13 August 1892.\n\nAt 5'9\" (175 cm) he was neither short nor tall, his dark hair was brushed forward, his countenance \"rather austere, perhaps thoughtful\", and his beard was \"prodigious\". Given the English fashion of the day for a clean-shaven face, Lafontaine’s beard was a subject of some considerable notoriety when he arrived in England — Spencer Timothy Hall's description of Lafontaine at a \"conversazione\" in 1841 is typical:\nRichard Harte, former journalist with the \"New York Telegram\", one-time member of the Theosophical Society Adyar (1877-1893), a former editor and regular contributor (often under the \"nom de guerre\" \"D.C.K.\") to \"The Theosophist\", and author of \"The New Psychology\", observed that,\nHe was introduced to mesmerism in Brussels, in 1831, by the Belgian lithographer, inventor, and scholar Jean Baptiste Ambroise Marcelin Jobard (1792-1861), who later become the director of the Royal Museum of Industry at Brussels. He then went on to study the works of Marquis de Puységur (1751-1825) and Joseph-Philippe-François Deleuze (1753-1835) and, abandoning the theatre altogether, he began touring parts of Europe.\n\nA detailed description of Lafontaine's magnetization technique, translated directly from the text of the fifth (1886) edition of his \"L'art de magnétiser\", is presented at Hart (1903), pp.66-69.\n\nHe decided to come to England in June 1841, and soon began to lecture in London. According to Goldsmith (1934, p.225), Lafontaine \"attracted considerable attention by mesmerizing a lion in the London Zoo\".\n\nLafontaine had almost no English at all, and had to use interpreters; also, he traveled with young assistants, one of whom was identified as ‘Eugene’ (or M. Eugéne), a French youth approximately 18, and a number of young (English) women who assisted him from time to time. On leaving London, he conducted “a lengthy tour of the provinces, visiting Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester, Liverpool, Ireland and Scotland” (Gauld, 1992, p.204). Although, from time to time, Lafontaine ‘treated’ individuals, he was principally what Gauld (1992, p.203) describes as a “magnetic demonstrator”; and, on most of the occasions in which he had provided ‘treatment’, the events were intended to be demonstrations, rather than the expression of the activities of a professional therapist.\n\nManchester surgeon, James Braid's first direct observation of the operation, and associated phenomena, of animal magnetism was at Lafontaine's third Manchester \"conversazione\" on 13 November 1841. Braid always maintained that he had gone to Lafontaine's demonstration as an open-minded sceptic — eager to examine the evidence and, then, form a considered opinion of Lafontaine's work. He was neither a closed-minded cynic intent on destroying Lafontaine, nor a deluded and naïvely credulous believer seeking authorization of his already formed belief.\n\nBraid was amongst the medical men who were invited onto the platform by Lafontaine. Braid examined the physical condition of Lafontaine's magnetised subjects (especially their eyes and their eyelids) and concluded that they were, indeed, in quite a different physical state. Braid always stressed the significance of his attending Lafontaine’s \"conversazione\" in the development of the theories, techniques, and practices of hypnotism. In \"Neurypnology\" (1843, pp.34-35) he states that he had earlier been totally convinced by a four-part investigation of Animal Magnetism published in \"The London Medical Gazette\" (i.e., Anon, 1838) that there was no evidence of any magnetic agency at all. The concluding paragraph of the final article read: \n\nAnd, as well as the strong impression made upon Braid by the \"Medical Gazette's\" article, there was also the more recent impressions made by Thomas Wakley’s exposure of the comprehensive fraud of John Elliotson’s subjects, the Okey sisters,\n\nBraid attended two more of Lafontaine's \"conversazione\" (his fourth and fifth). By the fifth (on Saturday 20 November 1841), Braid was convinced of the veracity of some of Lafontaine's effects and phenomena; and, in particular, whilst Braid was convinced that a transformation from, so to speak, condition to condition, and back to condition had really taken place, he was convinced that no \"magnetic agency\" of any sort (as Lafontaine claimed) was responsible for these veridical events. He also rejected outright the assertion that the transformation in question had \"proceeded from, or [had been] excited into action by another [person]\" (\"Neurypnology\", p.32).\n\nOn returning home on the evening of Saturday 20 November 1841, Braid performed his \"experimentum crucis\"; and, operating on the principle of Occam's Razor (that 'entities ought not to be multiplied beyond necessity'), and recognizing that he could diminish, rather than multiply entities, Braid made an extraordinary decision to perform a role-reversal and treat the operator-subject interaction as subject-internal, operator-guided procedure; rather than, as Lafontaine supposed, an operator-centred, subject-external procedure. Braid emphatically proved his point by his self-experimentation with his \"upwards and inwards squint\". In other words, rather than it being due, as Lafontaine supposed, to the charismatic influence of the operator's downward gaze, compounding the transfer of magnetic fluid that was supposedly being transferred, via the operator, through the subject's thumbs which were being tightly held by the operator, it was a simple biophysiological reflex produced by the subject's upward gaze.\n\nAnd, further, Braid's use of 'self-' or 'auto-hypnotism' (rather than 'hetero-hypnotism'), entirely by himself, on himself, and within his own home, clearly demonstrated that it had nothing whatsoever to do with the 'gaze', 'charisma', or 'magnetism' of the operator — all it needed was a subject's 'fixity of vision' on an 'object of concentration' at such a height and such a distance from the bridge of their nose that the desired 'upwards and inwards squint' was achieved. And, at the same time, by using himself as a subject, Braid also conclusively proved that none of Lafontaine's phenomena were due to magnetic agency. Braid conducted a number of experiments with self-hypnotization upon himself, and, by now convinced that he had discovered the natural psycho-physiological mechanism underlying these quite genuine effects, he performed his first act of hetero-hypnotization at his own residence, before several witnesses, including Captain Thomas Brown (1785–1862) on Monday 22 November 1841 – his first hypnotic subject was Mr. J. A. Walker. (see \"Neurypnology\", pp.16–20.)\n\nThe following Saturday (27 November 1841), Braid delivered his first public lecture at the Manchester Athenæum, in which, among other things, he was able to demonstrate that he could replicate the effects produced by Lafontaine, without the need for any sort of physical contact between the operator and the subject.\n\nOn the evening of Sunday, 10 April 1842, the controversial Liverpool cleric Hugh M‘Neile preached against \"Mesmerism\" for more than ninety minutes to a capacity congregation. He began, speaking of \"latter days\" — following which, Christ would return to Earth, and peace would reign for 1,000 years — and how, as the second advent neared, \"satanic agency amongst men\" would become ever more obvious; and, then, moving into a confusing admixture of philippic (against both Lafontaine and Braid, as, among other things, \"necromancers\"), and polemic (against animal magnetism), where he concluded that all mesmeric phenomena were due to \"satanic agency\".\n\nThe sermon was reported on at some length in the \"Liverpool Standard\", two days later; with all other newspaper reports being derived from the Liverpool Standard reporter's account. M‘Neile allowed the entire text of his original sermon, as transcribed by a stenographer (more than 7,500 words), to be published on Wednesday, 4 May 1842. M‘Neile's publication forced Braid to publish his own response as a pamphlet; which he did on Saturday, 4 June 1842. There is no contemporary record of any response by Lafontaine, either in print, or verbally in his lectures.\n\nIn 1866, a long way from 1842 Liverpool, Lafontaine presented a story — which it is not reported in any of the contemporary newspaper accounts — in which he claimed that, \"to Mac Neil’s great mortification\", (a) the Liverpool public (in particular women) flocked in droves to his 12 April lecture; (b) that (his interpreter) Nottingham was extremely caustic in his ridicule of the credulity, superstition and ignorance displayed by M‘Neile; and (c) \"to the audience’s delight\", Nottingham had loudly demanded M‘Neile’s presence, along with official church documents attesting that Lafontaine’s magnetic practices were damnable (1866, I, p.342).\n\nIn another of Lafontaine's (unsubstantiated from any other source) accounts in his \"memoirs\", he claims that, at some unspecified time several years later, he was dining in Paris with \"baronet sir Richard Dennis\" [sic], who introduced him to M‘Neile. M‘Neile, who was, initially, \"outraged by [Lafontaine’s] presence\", allegedly calmed down a little when \"Dennis\" explained that Lafontaine was \"the rescuer of the baronet’s two nieces\". Lafontaine conducted several experiments on a somnambulist (whom he had 'conveniently' brought along with him); and the success of his experiments, according to Lafontaine, \"removed the blindfold from poor Mr. Mac Neil\", and, at last, allowed him to see the truth of animal magnetism.\n\nOverall, Lafontaine's tour of the United Kingdom was a financial disaster; and, perhaps, largely due to the impact of M‘Neile's sermon, Lafontaine’s subsequent lecture tour of the north was a complete financial failure, and just before he returned to France, and he was forced to send a letter to a supporter in Leeds, subsequently published in the \"Leeds Mercury\" of 17 September 1842, requesting funds. \n\nWriting in 1843, John Elliotson observed that it seemed clear that Lafontaine came to England for \"pecuniary\" reasons, and left because he eventually \"found the affair unsuccessful\". Despite Elliotson's view that Lafontaine was \"a less educated man\" than Jules du Potet de Sennevoy (who had visited England four years earlier), he felt that Lafontaine’s visit had done \"great good\", and \"more ostensible good\" than had that of du Potet de Sennevoy \"because [Lafontaine] came at a period when the conviction of the truth [of mesmerism] had become much more diffused, and persons were more disposed to attend to the subject\".\n\nHe returned to France in late 1842, and subsequently travelled widely around Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\nAccording to his own account, Lafontaine visited Naples in 1849 and — having restored sight and hearing to some — was accused of blasphemously replicating the miracles of Christ. This placed him in controversial circumstances, and he was fortunate that the French Consul intervened on his behalf at the King’s Ministerial Council; and, according to Lafontaine, due to the Consul’s representations, King Ferdinand II (1810-1859) eventually made a royal decree: \"I consent to M. Lafontaine remaining in Naples, on the condition that will he not restore sight to the blind, or hearing to the deaf\". \n\nSoon after leaving Naples, he was granted an audience with Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti (1792-1878), or Pope Pius IX, in Rome on 14 November 1849. At the beginning of their discussion, having agreed that such things as ‘electricity’ and ‘magnetism’ were natural, and having read King Ferdinand’s decree, the Pope raised the issue of the possible dangers of ‘animal magnetism’. After some discussion with Lafontaine (in which Lafontaine claimed to have cured many ‘incurable’ diseases, including paralysis, epilepsy, and restored the faculties to the permanently deaf, mute, and blind) and some extensive demonstrations involving both the physical methods of intervention and the consequent manifestations (Lafontaine remarks that the time spent was far longer the usual four to five minutes allocated to such audiences) the Pope is said to have remarked: \"Well! Mr. Lafontaine, let us wish and hope that, for the good of humanity, animal-magnetism may soon be generally employed\". \n\nHe returned to France in January 1850; and, soon after, moved to Switzerland, where he remained until his death.\n\nHe published the journal \"Le Magnétiseur: Journal du Magnétisme Animal in Geneva\" from 1859 to 1872.\n\nIn April 1868, an 18 years old, Amélie Patonier, died as a consequence of incompetent treatment that had been delivered by the Swiss physician François-Auguste Ladé (1841-1866). A lethal over-dose of morphine had been administered to the young woman within a mixture that had been prepared by Louis Ladé, a trained pharmacist, and father of the physician in question.\n\nThe girl’s death was investigated in a very unsatisfactory fashion and, despite much evidence pointing to the incompetence and malpractice of both Ladés, neither was put on trial. The girl’s father, Jean-Pierre Patonier, published a pamphlet, giving precise details of the evidence that had been provided to the coroner, denouncing the failure of the justice system.\n\nLafontaine reprinted the text of Patonier's pamphlet, with some additional supportive editorial commentary in the September 1868 edition of \"Le Magnétiseur\", under the title \"Un Scandale medical\"; Lafontaine was sued for slander; he lost the case, and made a reparation/damages payment of 2,000 francs.\n\nLafontaine died in Geneva, Switzerland on 13 August 1892, a comparatively wealthy man.\n\n"}

He thus felt that this one was not actually a separate one, but rather a rephrasing of the first Beatitude at . To Augustine this eighth Beatitude symbolized Christ rising on the eighth day, which was also the first day. As with 5:3 this verse cites the Kingdom of Heaven as the reward, also like that first verse the reward is in the present tense, the other six have it in the future. Kodjak believes that this parallelism with the first verse is to emphasize that this one is the conclusion of the Beatitudes and - should not be considered part of the group. Davies and Allison also agree that the verse \"looks like it has been pieced together from other Beatitudes.\"\n\nGundry feels the word translated as \"persecuted\" should perhaps best be read as \"hounded\". Hill notes that \"persecuted\" is a participle in the perfect tense which indicates that Jesus' followers had already been persecuted for their righteousness.\n\nThis verse has often been cited as an argument for Christian toleration and acceptance. John Locke prominently cited it in his \"A Letter Concerning Toleration\". This argument was rebutted by inquisitors and others who pointed out that only those persecuted for \"righteousness' sake\" were to be blessed, something they did not think applied to the enemies of the church.\n"}

It is on the right bank of Syr Darya River and borders with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Tashkent Region, Fergana Region, and Andijan Region. It covers an area of 7,900 km. The population is estimated to be around 2,530,000, with over 62% of the population living in rural areas. The great river Syrdarya, the main waterway in Central Asia, starts in the territory of Namangan. Syrdarya is formed from inflows of the rivers Naryn and Kara Darya. The Namangan region is very rich in various natural resources. In particular, the region extracts oil in Mingbulak District and big gold and diamond deposits have been discovered in Kasansay and Pap Districts. There are also large deposits of uranium, silver, aluminum, tungsten, iron, copper, granite, and marble, among others. There are two big mountain tunnels connecting the Fergana valley with the inner city area and other regions of the country, located in the territory of Namangan.\n\nNamangan Region is divided into 11 administrative districts.\n\nThe climate is a typically continental climate with extreme differences between winter and summer temperatures.\n\nNatural resources include deposits of petroleum, natural gas, gold, lead, copper, quartz and antimony. Main agriculture includes cotton, horticulture and sericulture, animal husbandry, including breeding of Angora goats for their valuable down hair.\n\nIndustry is primarily based on textiles, with two large silk production complexes, a non-woven fabric manufacturing plant, cotton yarn processing, and numerous smaller textile, leather and footwear plants. The area is also a center for the production of traditional Uzbek handicrafts, especially knives.\n\nBy the first half of 2014, gross regional product of Namangan region has comprised UZS 2,214 billion, which is a 9.8% increase comparing to the same period in 2013.

He was a son of farmer James Magan and his wife Elizabeth Foley, of Kilmore, Dunshaughlin, County Meath. \n\nMagan was interned in the Curragh during the Irish Emergency (during the Second World War). In March 1946, he was arrested along with a number of other IRA men in the Ardee Bar, Dublin. Jailed, he was released in December 1946 along with Micksie Conway. Both men resumed their attempts to reorganise the IRA. \n\nA lifelong bachelor and County Meath farmer, Magan sold his farm and devoted all his time and money to the IRA. He was appointed IRA chief of staff by the IRA Army Executive at its convention in September 1948. The IRA had almost been destroyed in the 1940s and Magan immediately set out to reorganise the political and military wings of the Republican Movement, namely the IRA and Sinn Féin, along with Michael Traynor, Paddy McLogan, and Tomás Mac Curtain.\n\nMagan was not a popular choice for the position and several members of his previous IRA Army Council were not impressed by him but did not oppose his nomination outright. Magan drew support chiefly from Dublin delegates, who felt that \"the Army needed a steel core and that Magan could supply it\".\n\nMagan was a determined physical force traditionalist. According to J. Bowyer Bell, he \"wanted to create a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade\", with \"no shadow of a gangster gunman, no taint of communism, but a band of volunteers solely dedicated to reuniting Ireland by physical force\". Tim Pat Coogan describes him as \"priest-like - who had given all his money, time and thought to the IRA, a deeply religious man of the old-guard school of Irish Catholicism [and] when he was again interned in the Curragh during the 1950s Border Campaign he organised a flourishing branch of the Legion of Mary\".\n\nAt the 1950 Sinn Féin Ardfheis, Magan was elected honorary joint secretary of the party. Coogan recounts that Magan's Sinn Féin submitted key political and economic policies for review by friendly clergy, \"to ensure that they contained nothing contrary to Catholic teaching\". In May 1951, the IRA leadership established a Military Council to draft an overall plan for the Republican Movement as a whole. Its members were Magan (as Chief of Staff), Tomás Mac Curtáin (as chairman of the Army Council), Pádraig Mac Lógáin (as president of Sinn Féin and chairman of the IRA Army Executive), a former British army officer with World War II experience service who was an expert on guerrilla warfare, and one other person. \n\nIn 1953, Magan played a role in organising and carrying out the Felstead arms raid.

The group velocity or \"intramodal\" dispersion which dominates in single-mode fibers includes both material and waveguide dispersion. Waveguide dispersion can be made more negative by changing the index profile and thus be used to offset the fixed material dispersion, shifting or flattening the overall intramodal dispersion. This is advantageous because it allows a communication system to possess both low dispersion and low attenuation. However, when used in wavelength division multiplexing systems, dispersion-shifted fibers can suffer from four-wave mixing which causes intermodulation of the independent signals. As a result, nonzero dispersion shifted fiber is often used.\n\nDispersion-shifted fiber is specified in ITU-T G.653.\n\n"}

It is native to East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East). It is commonly known as balloon flower (referring to the balloon-shaped flower buds), Chinese bellflower, or platycodon.\n\nGrowing to tall by wide, it is an herbaceous perennial with dark green leaves and blue flowers in late summer. A notable feature of the plant is the flower bud, which swells like a balloon before fully opening. The five petals are fused together into a bell shape at the base, like its relatives, the campanulas. \n\nPlatycodon grandiflorus is a perennial plant which is commonly grown in mountains and fields. It is 40 to 100 centimeters high and has thick roots, and white juice comes out when the stem is cut. Leaves are 5 to 12 centimeters long, with narrow ends and teeth on the edges.\n\nFlowers bloom purple or white in July and August, with one or several running upward at the end of the circle. The flower crown is divided into five branches in the shape of an open bell.\n\nIt lives throughout Japan, China, and eastern Siberia, including the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThis plant is hardy down to , and can therefore be cultivated in all temperate zones. It dies down completely in winter, reappearing in late spring and flowering in summer. However, plants are widely available from nurseries in full flower from April onwards.\n\nThough the species has blue flowers, there are varieties with white, pink, and purple blooms. In Korea, white flowers are more common. This plant, together with its cultivars 'Apoyama group' and 'Mariesii', have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nIn Korea, the plant as well as its root are referred to as (). The root, fresh or dried, is one of the most common vegetables. It is also one of the most frequent ingredients in bibimbap. Sometimes, rice is cooked with balloon flower root to make . Preparation of the root always involves soaking and washing (usually rubbing it with coarse sea salt and rinsing it multiple times), which gets rid of the bitter taste.\n\nThe root is also used to make desserts, such as . Syrup made from the root, called (balloon flower root honey), can be used to make (balloon flower root tea). The root can be used to infuse liquor called , typically using distilled soju or other unflavored hard alcohol that has an ABV higher than 30% as a base.\nIn addition, other ingredients include calcium, fiber, iron, minerals, proteins and vitamins. Bottlenose is a good product for its thick roots, faithful interior, and strong taste. It is used as an anti-inflammatory, Jinhae, analgesic, sedative, and fever agent. It is also effective in reducing cholesterol, which can be effective in blood related diseases and high blood pressure. Doraji is good for young children and elderly people who have weak immune systems that are vulnerable to respiratory diseases, as well as for asthma, which can be called respiratory illness.\n\nThe extracts and purified platycoside compounds (saponins) from the roots of \"Platycodon grandiflorum\" may exhibit neuroprotective, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-allergy, improved insulin resistance, and cholesterol-lowering properties. Evidence for these potential effects was mainly observed in vitro, with the exception of cholesterol lowering effects documented in vitro and in rats. The lack of efficacy and limited safety data in humans, however, necessitate further research.\n\nThe Chinese bellflower (called in Chinese) is also used in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nIn China, they are used as a cough suppressant and expectorant for common colds, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, and chest congestion.\n\nIn Korea, the roots are commonly used for treating bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, diabetes, and other inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe bellflower is called () in Japanese. Traditionally, it is one of the Seven Autumn Flowers.

The traditional territory of the Attawapiskat First Nation extends beyond their reserve up the coast to Hudson Bay and hundreds of kilometres inland along river tributaries. The community is connected to other towns along the shore of James Bay by the seasonal ice road/winter road constructed each December, linking it to the towns of Kashechewan First Nation, Fort Albany, and Moosonee (Minkin 2008:1) Attawapiskat, Fort Albany, and Kashechewan operate and manage the James Bay Winter Road through a jointly owned corporation named after the Cree word for \"our road\" \"kimesskanemenow\", the Kimesskanemenow Corporation. Attawapiskat is the most remote northerly link on the road to Moosonee. They control the reserves at Attawapiskat 91 and Attawapiskat 91A.\n\nAttawapiskat (, unpointed: ) means \"people of the parting of the rocks\" from the Swampy Cree language (). The Attawapiskat River carved out several clusters of spectacular high limestone islands less than from its mouth that are unique to the region. These formations (and therefore the river and community) are called in Swampy Cree.\n\n\"[A]ncestors of today's Attawapiskat band occupied all the territory from the Kapiskau River in the south, to Hudson Bay (Cape Henrietta Maria) in the north, and from Akimiski Island in the east to Lake Mississa (150 miles inland) to the west. This has been contended by the present day chief and council [oral history], is supported by documentation in the archives of the HBC [Hudson's Bay Company], and was documented by Honigmann [1948].\"\n\nA land use study was carried out \"jointly by the Research Program for Technology Assessment in Subarctic Ontario (TASO), the Mushkegowuk Council, its constituent First Nations, and the Omushkegowuk Harvesters Association. The overall purpose of the project was to help the regional Council and its associations develop a strategy for natural resource co-management, self-government, and sustainable regional development. In 1990 Dr. Fikret Berkes, Distinguished Professor and Canada Research Chair at the University of Manitoba, and a team of academics interviewed 925 aboriginal hunters from eight communities (Attawapiskat, Moose Factory, Moosonee, New Post, Fort Albany, Kashechewan, Peawanuck and Fort Severn) of the Mushkegowuk region, Hudson and James Bay Lowland. Their results published in 1995, showed \"that geographically extensive land use for hunting and fishing persists in the Mushkegowuk region, some . However, the activity pattern of Omushkego (West Main) Cree harvesters has changed much over the decades; contemporary harvesting involves numerous short trips of a few days' duration instead of the traditional long trips. Although the First Nations control only (0.36% of the region) as Indian reserve land, they continue to use large parts of their traditional territory (Berkes et al. 1995:81).\"\n\nIn her Masters thesis (1998) Jacqueline Hookimaw-Witt, a Muskego-Cree, interviewed elders from Attawapiskat who described in great detail ways in which they continued to harvest, fish and hunt for food, clothing, crafts and subsistence to complement store-bought items. Hookimaw-Witt was the first Muskego-Cree to earn a doctorate.\n\nAttawapiskat is a coastal community in the western Hudson Bay Lowland, a vast wetland located between the Canadian Shield and James Bay and Hudson Bay. The town or hamlet of Attawapiskat now covers of land and is located along the Attawapiskat River, inland from the James Bay coastline. It is in the James Bay drainage basin. It is in the Kenora District which is in the extreme north of Ontario. Timmins, the nearest urban center, is located approximately south. Moosonee is south of Attawapiskat. It is located 52°55′ north and 82°26′ west.\n\nThe vegetation is typically subarctic with a mostly coniferous forest (stunted black spruce and tamarack) in the muskeg. Wildlife includes geese, ducks, caribou, moose, beaver, bear, wolves, wolverine, marten, rabbit, muskrat, otter, and other species.\n\nWinter roads constructed each December link Attawapiskat First Nation with Fort Albany First Nation, Kashechewan, Moosonee and Moose Factory to the south. (Minkin 2008:1)\n\nThe fertile soil (0.8 meters deep) is underlain by clay and silt. It is normal for the river to rise . The community has experienced partial and complete flooding.\n\nThe Attawapiskat kimberlite field is a field of kimberlite pipes in the Canadian Shield located astride the Attawapiskat River on Attawapiskat First Nation land. It is thought to have formed about 180 million years ago in the Jurassic period when the North American Plate moved westward over a centre of upwelling magma called the New England hotspot, also referred to as the Great Meteor hotspot.\n\nThe area is composed of 18 kimberlite pipes of the Attawapiskat kimberlite field, 16 of which are diamondiferous; the Victor Mine sits on top of the Victor pipe and mines from Victor Main and Victor Southwest which have appeared close enough to the surface to be used in an open-pit mine. The Victor Kimberlite is a composition of pyroclastic crater facies and hypabyssal facies, and is considered to have a highly variable diamond grade.\n\nSince June 26, 2008, the De Beers open pit Victor Diamond Mine has been in operation mining two pipes in the field at , about west of the community of Attawapiskat. The mine expected to produce of diamonds a year.\n\nThere are over 2,800 members of Attawapiskat First Nation, but the local on-reserve population was 1,549 according to the 2011 census. More than a third of the members of the Attawapiskat First Nation who still live on their home reserve are under the age of 19 and three-quarters are under the age of 35 (2010-12-03). Altogether, 5% of the community, 101 people, have attempted suicide over the seven months from September 2015 to April 2016.\n\nAlmost all of the Aboriginal population of Attawapiskat speak the Swampy Cree language, one of the varieties of the Cree language, as their first language. Many elders understand very little English; they speak Cree and other Aboriginal languages. Some of these elders, such as Shano Fireman, self-identify as Inninew (person, part of the people Cree).\n\nAttawapiskat is home to the Mushkego, Omushkego James Bay Cree also known as Mushkegowuk Cree Omushkegowuk Cree, western James Bay, west-coast, Swampy, Omushkego, and Hudson Bay Lowland Cree)(General 2012:2). The location of the town has been a gathering place for local Native people for centuries but their land use and occupation covered a vast area. Originally it was a seasonal camp that was visited only in the spring and summer to take advantage of the prime fishing on one of the main drainage rivers of James Bay. Historically, in the wintertime, families left the location to live in other trapping, hunting and gathering sites along the coast, inland or on Akimiski Island (General 2012:iii). also known as \"Agamiski and Atimiski Island, and less commonly as Agumiski, Akamiski, Kamanski, Viner's Island, and Oubaskou.\"(General 2012:5).\n\nAttawapiskat was entered into treaty with Canada relatively late, in 1930 (Treaty 9 adhesion), and the majority of the First Nation members moved to the community as late as the mid-1960s. Traditional structures, thinking and interpretation of life were maintained in a deeper fashion than for many less isolated First Nations communities. Some elders lead a traditional life on the land, moving into the community only over Christmas season. Some families, although having their home base in the community, use the land extensively as their economic and social basis. The vast majority of community members are involved in the yearly goose hunts in fall and spring. Therefore, there is an awareness of traditional way of life among most of the Attawapiskat First Nation members.\n\nAttawapiskat has grown from a settlement of temporary dwellings, such as tents and teepees, in the 1950s to a community with permanent buildings, which were constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Traditional harvesters from Attawapiskat First Nation continue to regularly hunt caribou, goose, and fish along the Attawapiskat River, while tending trap lines throughout the region (Berkes et al., 1994; Whiteman, 2004). This goes beyond subsistence hunting and fishing. It comprises an important part of local culture and identity (Inf. #2, 4).\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company introduced the commercial fur trapping economy first by establishing a post in Fort Albany in the late 17th century. The post in Attawapiskat was established toward the end of the 19th century (Honigmann 1953:816).\n\nAttawapiskat was also once an outpost of Revillon Frères.\n\nAttawapiskat was officially recognized by the Government of Canada under the Treaty 9 document. Although the original document was signed in the years 1905 and 1906, it only included the communities south of the Albany River in northern Ontario. Attawapiskat was included when adhesions were made to the treaty to include the communities north of the Albany River. Attawapiskat was numbered as Attawapiskat Indian Reserve 91 as part of Treaty 9. The treaty set aside reserve lands on the Ekwan River, a parallel river north of the Attawapiskat River that drains into James Bay, totalling 27040.10 hectares. In time, it was decided by local leaders to establish the community in its present location on the Attawapiskat River instead. This was due to an existing trading post and better access to James Bay shipping routes from this location. The new reserve, which contains 235.8 hectares, was then numbered Attawapiskat Indian Reserve 91A.\n\nLocal leadership is an elected government of a chief, a deputy chief and twelve councillors who serve three-year terms. The current chief (2016) is Ignace Gull. The band council was under Third Party Intervention for part of 2011–2012. While the federal government had preemptively removed the third-party manager, a Federal Court decision later deemed the Third Party Management arrangement 'unreasonable'.\n\nAttawapiskat First Nation is part of the regional Mushkegowuk Council, an Aboriginal political group representing the James Bay Mushkego or Omushkego Cree. The community and the Council are together represented under the Political Territorial Organization, Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN), which represents 50 First Nations in Northern Ontario. NAN is the representative political body for the First Nations that are part of Treaty 9. The current Grand Chief of Nishnabwe-Aski Nation is Harvey Yesno. The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) is the national representative organization of the 630 First Nation's communities in Canada.\n\nThe reserve is within the federal riding of Timmins—James Bay, and the provincial riding of Mushkegowuk—James Bay. , the current provincial Member of Parliament (MPP) is Guy Bourgouin (NDP) and federal member of parliament is Charlie Angus (NDP).\n\nGrand Chief Stan Louttit of Mushkegowuk Council observed that \"At the height of the Attawapiskat housing crisis over a year ago, the Attawapiskat First Nation made it very clear to the government that they would welcome a forensic audit to be carried out. The government chose not to conduct such an audit only to settle for a limited audit by the firm of Deloitte. The \"Audit of the AANDC and Attawapiskat First Nation (AFN) Management Control Framework\" by Deloitte and Touche LLP was completed on September 28, 2012. Chief Teresa Spence took office in 2010 but the audit's investigation covers the period between April 1, 2005, and November 30, 2011. Attawapiskat First Nation (AFN) voluntarily agreed to the audit. The federal government had commissioned the audit in December 2011 in response to a declaration of a state of emergency regarding a long-standing and continual crisis of housing. According to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, \"only 46 of Attawapiskat's 316 housing units are considered adequate, while another 146 need major work and 122 are placement.\"\n\nA CBC radio report noted that insensitive timing of the announcement to CBC and the online publication of the audit just before a controversial, highly publicized and much anticipated meeting on January 11, between Prime Minister Stephen Harper and First Nations leadership. For Grand Chief Stan Louttit of Mushkegowuk Council, the meeting was to be \"an important and critical opportunity for dialogue and to work towards some key deliverables into the future.\" For others was a \"hopeful sign of a new beginning in building nation to nation respectful relationships\" and \"the beginning of implementing the 1996 Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.\" The timing did \"not reflect too well on the government.\" CBC correspondent Terry Milewski reported that the auditors did \"not allege fraud\" but raised \"questions about bookkeeping\" on the part of the federal government and the Band.\n\nThe audit \"shows an unacceptable level of expenditures for which proper documentation was not provided.\" Aboriginal and Northern Affairs representative revealed that of the 316 homes, 85% are \"unfit for human habitation\".(CBC 2013-01-07). The total amount of all AANDC funding to Attawapiskat First Nation which includes health, education, infrastructure, housing and administration, [notes 2] etc. was approximately $104M over that time (Deloitte and Touche 2012-09-28 p. 6). The area under scrutiny by the audit, was the c. $8.3M for \"housing-related activities through the Capital Facilities and Maintenance (CFM) program, which included $6.85M for housing maintenance; $1M for immediate housing needs; and, $450K for housing renovations under Canada's Economic Action Plan.\" One of the positive outcomes was the observation that AANDC, CMHC, and Attawapiskat First Nation, \"worked in partnership at the regional level to determine allocations of housing funds for the Attawapiskat First Nation.\"\n\nIt was revealed in the audit that Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) only conducted one physical condition review of Attawapiskat First Nation housing units during the period from April 1, 2005, to November 2011. The April 2009 review was conducted on a very small sample in a single 27-unit housing project built in 1990 and 1994. These units had \"poor indoor air quality, high water table and overcrowding.\" CMHC did not share this report with Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development (Indian Affairs and Northern Development). Recommendations included changes regarding loan eligibility, improvements in reporting, book-keeping, for example, CMHC Physical Condition Reviews must be shared with AANDC. It was noted that there is a chronic problem with collection of rent in arrears which impedes loan payments to CMHC and the challenges of evicting tenants [54] in this impoverished, remote northern community already plagued by overcrowding. In it the auditors found \"an average of 81 per cent of files did not have adequate supporting documents and over 60 per cent had no documentation of the reason for payment.\" Additionally, the letter delivered to Chief Spence stated the audit revealed \"no evidence of due diligence on the part of Attawapiskat of funding provided by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada for housing projects and Health Canada for health-related projects.\"\n\nA state of emergency was declared after eleven people attempted suicide on April 9, 2016. A document signed by Chief Bruce Shisheesh and eight councillors reflects that there were twenty-eight suicide attempts during March 2016. More than one hundred people attempted suicide between September 2015 and April 2016 and one person has died. Reasons cited for the many suicide attempts are: overcrowding with 14 to 15 people living in one home; bullying at school; residential schools; and physical, sexual and drug abuse. Health Canada provided $340,860 for mental health and wellness programs and $9,750 for the National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, which the reserve claims is inadequate and they are overwhelmed. Local hospitals which are in already poor condition have also been overrun by the amount of suicide attempts and previously ill patients.\n\nEconomic and employment opportunities are limited to work within the community, mainly in the service sector or for the local band council. There are only a handful of businesses in the town.\n\n\nFrom 1927 to 1960, the Catholic Church's Oblate Mission operated a sawmill.\n\nIn 1901 the Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post and store in town. The Northern Store took over the operations from HBC in the 1980s.\n\nDe Beers Canada officially opened De Beers Victor Diamond Mine, Ontario's first ever diamond mine on July 26, 2008. De Beers has spent approximately $1 billion on construction of the mine. It is an open-pit mine located west of the settlement of Attawapiskat on Attawapiskat First Nation traditional land.\n\n\"Traditional harvesters from Attawapiskat First Nation regularly hunt caribou, goose, and fish along the Attawapiskat River, while tending trap lines throughout the region (Berkes et al., 1994; Whiteman, 2004). Like many other northern Cree communities, these traditional activities are more than subsistence, comprising an important part of local culture and identity (Inf. #2, 4). Therefore, the community leadership was very concerned with the proposed development of the Victor mine, and, at De Beers` invitation, sought to ensure that any environmental impacts of the mine would be effectively mitigated.\"\n\nAn Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) was signed with community leaders in 2005 with Danny Metatawabin, acting as coordinator for the Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) between De Beers and Attawapiskat. Community members later protested the agreement through demonstrations and roadblocks, claiming that the community's share of the \"bounty from the mine isn't getting back to the community.\" De Beers has negotiated a lease area. Although it is acknowledged that the mine is on Attawapiskat traditional land, the royalties from Victor Mine flow to the Province of Ontario, not Attawapiskat First Nation. They have 500 full-time employees, with 100 from Attawapiskat First Nation. De Beers also employs Attawapiskat First Nation in winter road construction. The \"mine employ[s] 100 people from Attawapiskat at any one time. It generates about $400 million in annual revenue for the company. \" Sub-contractors from Attawapiskat First Nation also work for the mine.\n\nThe company has transferred about $10.5 million to a trust fund held by Attawapiskat as of January 2011. The Attawapiskat Trust, established January 1, 2007, receives payments made by De Beers Canada and Attawapiskat Limited Partnership (ALP) as part of the Victor Diamond Project Impact and Benefits Agreement (November 3, 2005-11-03) (Financial Statements Attawapiskat Trust 2012 p. 4). The beneficiary of the trust includes \"all members of Attawapiskat on a collective and undivided basis (Financial Statements Attawapiskat Trust 2012 p. 4).\"\n\nVictor was forecast to have a \"17-year cradle-to-grave life. That includes construction, an estimated 12 years of operation and then winding down to closure and rehabilitation of the site (Grech 2011-06-22).\" In an interview with CBC reporter Megan Thomas in Sudbury, Ontario (CBC 2013-02-06), De Beers' Victor Mine spokesperson explained that Victor Mine could be exhausted by 2018 as was originally anticipated. It would take several years to close the mine completely. It is not economically viable with present-day technology to mine the deeper remaining 40 meters of diamond-bearing layers. However, the mine had produced at a high level of performance leading to \"[f]urther exploration of the site\" with the \"hope that De Beers will uncover another source of diamonds within close proximity of the existing operation.\" Tom Ormsby, claimed that \"The high quality of the Victor diamonds and the vastness of the Canadian shield points to great potential for another diamond mine being developed in northeastern Ontario.\" The \"Canadian Shield has great potential to host diamonds\" Canada's potential in Canada \"appears to be at least twice as good as what southern Africa has held for potential for diamonds (Grech 2011-06-22).\"\n\n\"A federal review of the relationship between De Beers' Victor mine and Attawapiskat showed that government support for training and capacity did not start soon enough to deal with the huge lack of skills in the First Nation.\"\n\nTravel to Attawapiskat is accessible through Attawapiskat Airport year-round. The airport was opened in 1974, but air service in the community began in 1957. The airport is equipped with a gravel runway that was constructed in the 1970s.\n\nCirca 2007, Thunder Airlines supplanted Air Creebec, as supplier of postal services and for shipping goods. Heavier goods are shipped into the community via a seasonal barge from Moosonee.\n\nFrom Moosonee the Ontario Northland Railway runs south to Cochrane, with bus connections further south to Toronto and Southern Ontario.\n\nDuring the winter months, a \"Winter Road\" is constructed that connects the community to other coastal towns on the James Bay coast. The first roads were built by the province in 1956. Winter roads are temporary routes of transportation that are constructed mostly in January, February, March and even April throughout remote parts of Northern Ontario. The seasonal James Bay winter road connects the communities of Attawapiskat, Kashechewan, Fort Albany, Moosonee and Moose Factory. James Bay Winter Road is operated or managed by Kimesskanemenow Corporation. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation has an office and representative in the town.\n\nResidents of several remote coastal communities often take advantage of the winter road to purchase goods and perishables, by making long trips to Moosonee. Residents drive cars, vans and small trucks (SUV or pickups), while some may use ATVs or bikes and snowmobiles in winter months. When the winter road is in good condition, the trip can take five hours to Kashechewan, one way. During the period when the winter road is open, certain community band members offer taxi services, shuttling between the communities. James Bay Winter Road is available in the winter months barring bad weather such as blizzards and heavy snowfalls, at which point access will be closed until the road is inspected and snow is plowed away.\n\nRoads in town are not paved, and are either dirt or gravel. Beyond the winter roads, none of the gravel roads connect beyond Attawapiskat.\n\nFeasibility studies have been undertaken on the construction of a permanent all-season road to the communities. The project, if undertaken, will entail a \"coastal road\" connecting the four communities with each other, as well as a road to link the coastal road to the provincial highway system at Fraserdale, Kapuskasing or Hearst.\n\nRoads are generally unnamed (Airport Road, River Road, Meenish Road, 1A Street and 2nd Street are the few named streets) and most places in town use post office boxes for identification.\n\nAttawapiskat is policed by the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Aboriginal-based service that replaced the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP). This change took place in the early 1990s in most remote northern communities in Ontario. The community is served by the Attawapiskat detachment in the Northeast Region.\n\nBasic health services are provided by nursing staff at the 15 bed Attawapiskat Hospital of Weeneebayko Area Health Authority (main wing in Moosonee, Ontario), a provincial hospital which provides sixteen beds for pediatric, medical/surgical and chronic care. The hospital replaced St. Mary's Hospital, established by the Catholic Church in 1951, in 1969. Health services are provided by a nursing staff. However, like other remote communities on the James Bay coast, there is no doctor in the community. A physician from Weeneebayko General Hospital in Moose Factory visits Attawapiskat, as well as other communities along the coast on a regular basis during each month. Patients with serious injuries, or those requiring surgery, must be transported to a larger centre for treatment. These emergency patients are transported by air ambulance airplane or helicopter to medical centres in Moose Factory, Timmins, Sudbury or Kingston, depending on their condition.\n\nJames Bay General Hospital was merged with federally operated Weeneebayko General Hospital to improve health care services in the region.\n\nAttawapiskat Health Clinic provides additional outpatient health care services to the community and is located across the street from Weenebayko General Hospital Attawapiskat Wing.\n\nOn May 1, 2013, officials announced that the hospital was closed and evacuated because of flooding in the area.\n\nAttawapiskat Fire Rescue consists of a fire department of nine (one fire chief, one lieutenant and seven firefighters) at one station with one pumper.\n\nPre-hospital medical care is provided by James Bay Ambulance Service, a service run by Weeneebayko Area Health Authority funded by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The community is served by one EMS base (#02) with two ambulances (one primary and one reserve) for the entire community. There are eight primary care paramedics stationed at this base which operates 24/7/365.\n\nMaytawaywin Authority provides recreational services at Reg Louttit Sportsplex, a community centre and sportsplex:\n\n\nA healing lodge, the Jules Mattinas Healing Lodge, is located northwest of Attawapiskat and connected by a road. The building's entrance is shaped as a teepee.\n\nSt. Ignatius Catholic Church, built in 1935, was the only place of \"westernized\" worship in Attawapiskat for many years and also maintains the local cemetery. St. Ignatius is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Keewatin–Le Pas. A second large burial grounds, St. Mary Cemetery, is located in the west end of town.\n\nOther places of \"westernized\" worship are two Pentecostal places of worship.\n\nAttawapiskat Canadian Ranger Patrol is a Canadian Ranger unit attached to the 3rd Canadian Ranger patrol group (based at CFB Borden) and was formed in 1994.\n\nElders now living in Attawapiskat reported that in the 1930s and 1940s they sent their children to Saint Anne's Residential School in Fort Albany (1936–1964) because there was no school in Attawapiskat. The same group of elders described the first school in Attawapiskat, built by the missionaries, which operated as a summer school that was only open in July and August so it would not interfere with traditional life. Attawapiskat School, designed by one of the first Canadian women architects in 1951 Lennox Grafton opened in 1953.\n\nPrimary school students attended J.R. Nakogee School, which was constructed in the 1970s and opened in 1976. J.R. Nakogee School was closed on May 11, 2000, because of site contamination and possible health problems that were attributed to a massive diesel leak at the site that occurred in 1979. The students and staff have since been in portables. Secondary school students attend Vezina Secondary School, which was established in the early 1990s with additions built in following years. The secondary school was founded by John B. Nakogee in 1991 and it was named after Father Rodigue Vezina, a local Catholic priest who has served the community since 1975. Before the high school was opened in 1991, high school students had to go to Timmins, North Bay, or Ottawa for their studies.\n\nIn May 2000, the First Nation was forced to close its elementary school and the community's students received their elementary education in a series of portables. Money that had been allocated for the renovation of the deteriorating physical condition of the 25-year-old frame construction school was used to fund the construction of eight double and three single portable classrooms. The facilities were basic, with none of the supplementary resources available to schools in other parts of the province. A new school was promised by the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs in the summer of 2000, but no action was taken for several years. The Education Authority's Chairman summed up the community's plight by saying: \"We just want what any other parent would want for their children - a safe school.\" A study by B. H. Martin indicates that the total area available for instruction is only about 50% of the space allocated in Indian Affairs' School Space Accommodation Standards.\n\nBeginning in 2007, local teenager Shannen Koostachin launched \"Education Is a Human Right\", an activist campaign to publicize the lack of educational opportunities for First Nations youth. Koostachin was killed in a car accident near New Liskeard, where she was attending high school, in 2010; the campaign was subsequently renamed Shannen's Dream in her memory, and continues to operate. The campaign was the subject of Alanis Obomsawin's award-winning 2013 documentary film \"Hi-Ho Mistahey!\"\n\nAttawapiskat First Nation marked the ground breaking for a new elementary school on June 22, 2012. Assembly of First Nations National Chief Shawn Atleo congratulated the community of Attawapiskat as they celebrated the ground breaking. On September 8, 2014, the new Kattawapiskak Elementary School was officially opened.\n\nOn May 1, 2013, officials announced the closure of all schools in the community because of flooding.\n\n\nNote: Many channels from TV shows public to community and up to 48 TV channels\n\nLocal television cable service is provided by Attawapiskat Development Corporation.\n\nTelecommunications in the community is received from a tower located next to the hospital.\n\nFive Nations Energy Inc was created in 2001–2003 to distribute electricity from Hydro One from the Moosonee Substation. Prior to 2000 power was supplied by diesel generators located in Fort Albany.\n\nThe cost of living in Attawapiskat is quite high, because of the expense of shipping goods to the community.\n\nLocal stores include the Northern Store and M. Koostachin & Sons (1976). Prior to January 2013, more than a third of the residents occasionally placed orders for perishables and other goods (except alcohol) which were shipped in via aircraft from Timmins, and for which the residents made prepayments with money orders. When their orders arrived, the residents had to pick them up at the local airport. For example, six apples and four small bottles of juice cost $23.50 (2011-12-01).\n\nThe price of gasoline is considerably higher than the provincial average. When the fuel is shipped via winter road, the prices of gasoline and propane tend to drop slightly.\n\nIt costs $250,000 to build a house in Attawapiskat. The cost of renovating one condemned house is $50,000–100,000.\nA majority of the community members have updated their heating needs, while many households still use dry firewood. Firewood in Attawapiskat costs $150 and $200 a cord, and a cord will heat a winter-bound tent for only a week, or at most 10 days.\n\nPrior to the 1970s clean potable water from the Attawapiskat River and Monument Channel was obtained using buckets and pails. There was no running water.\n\nWhen in 1976, AANDC recommended that the community water supply should come not from the river but from an inland lake (slough) just northeast of the hamlet, community members using traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) were aware that the water intake site proposed was too high in organics. They were right and no filtration system since then has proven adequate to control the quantities of organics without over-compensation with chemicals. Two consecutive treatment plants have failed, causing health problems. According to GENIVAR senior engineer, Rod Peters (2012), \"The real problem is that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level is just too high to start. When you chlorinate the filtered water, trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acid (HAA5s) are formed within five minutes of contact.\" As well there's bromide in the raw water from the slough which reacts with the ozonate bromide used in the filtration process, turning to \"bromate, which is a carcinogen.\"\n\n\"Not only, then, did the original design not work properly, but it presented potential health hazards. Technically, the filtration system in Attawapiskat right now will not be able to bring water to compliance with the recommended drinking water quality guidelines for Health Canada\", Peters confirms.\n\nAttawapiskat has been plagued with water \"supply, treatment, and distribution challenges\" since at least 1992, according to Peters. In c. 2009 GENIVAR was asked by the community and Aboriginal and Northern Affairs Canada (AANDC, then INAC) \"to identify a suitable water intake site on the Attawapiskat River\" (Freek 2012).\n\nIn March 2012 there was a Health Canada advisory warning residents to \"minimize their exposure to household tap water\". This means bottled water for most residents. Boiling water does not make it safe to drink because it does not remove the THMs. Exposure to tap water has to be limited and filters only help in some cases.\n\nHomes are mainly pre-fabricated wooded structures with newer trailer units arriving after the 2011 floods.\n\nOn October 28, 2011, the Attawapiskat First Nations leadership declared a state of emergency in response to dropping temperatures, and the resulting health and safety concerns due to inadequate housing. Many residents were still living in tents, trailers and temporary shelters, and many residences and public buildings lacked running water and electricity. In one case, children, the elderly, and the ill were sleeping in rooms just a few feet away from a 2009 raw sewage spill that had not been adequately cleaned.\n\nAttawapiskat residents were evacuated during flood conditions in May 2009. The sole elementary school building, a state-of-the-art construction in 1976, was closed in 2000 because of toxic fumes from a 1979 diesel spill.\n\nAlong with 300 houses, there are five tents and 17 sheds used for housing. Trailers that house 90 people cost $100,000 a year to maintain.\n\nAboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan claimed that officials in his department were unaware of Attawapiskat's housing problems until October 28, 2011, despite having visited the community many times that year.\n\nIn November, 2011, a spokesperson for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs stated that the reserve had received a commitment of $500,000 to renovate five vacant housing units, and that it had already received \"a significant boost from Canada's Economic Action Plan and funding dedicated to a new subdivision, of which 44 houses have been completed\". The Prime Minister stated that the Attawapiskat First Nation had received $90 million in transfer payments since the federal Conservative Party was elected in 2006. On December 30, 2012, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development stated that $131 million will have been spent on Attawapiskat from 2006 to the end of fiscal year 2012–13, which includes 60 houses that have been renovated or newly constructed; a new school is also under construction.\n\nThe $90 million in transfer payments referred to by the Prime Minister is an aggregate figure, encompassing more than just housing. This amount includes all federal funding for Attawapiskat over 5 years, which includes education, health care, social services, housing and many other necessities. All of these programs require infrastructure and human resources that are also included in the total. It is estimated that $84 million is needed for housing alone in Attawapiskat.\n\nThe crisis is the subject of a 2012 documentary by First Nations filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin, \"The People of the Kattawapiskak River\", and the 2015 documentary \"After the Last River\" by Victoria Lean. Obomsawin was present in the community in 2011, working on another film for the National Film Board of Canada, when the housing issue came to national attention. The Attawapiskat band received a total estimated revenue of $34 million in 2011: $17.6 million from the federal government, $4.4 million from the provincial government, and income derived from non-governmental sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2180274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180274", "title": "Chaining", "text": "Chaining\n\nChaining is a type of intervention that aims to create associations between behaviors in a behavior chain. A behavior chain is a sequence of behaviors that happen in a particular order where the outcome of the previous step in the chain serves as a signal to begin the next step in the chain. In terms of behavior analysis, a behavior chain is begun with a discriminative stimulus (SD) which sets the occasion for a behavior, the outcome of that behavior serves as a reinforcer for completing the previous step and as another SD to complete the next step. This sequence repeats itself until the last step in the chain is completed and a terminal reinforcer (the outcome of a behavior chain, i.e. with brushing your teeth the terminal reinforcer is having clean teeth) is achieved. For example, the chain in brushing your teeth starts with seeing the toothbrush, this sets the occasion to get toothpaste, which then leads to putting it on your brush, brushing the sides and front of mouth, spitting out the toothpaste, rinsing your mouth, and finally putting away your toothbrush. To outline behavior chains, as done in the example, we use a task analysis.\n\nChaining is used to teach complex behaviors made of behavior chains that the current learner does not have in their repertoire. Various steps of the chain can be in the learner’s repertoire, but the steps the learner doesn’t know how to do have to be in the category of can’t do instead of won’t do (issue with knowing the skill not an issue of compliance). There are three different types of chaining which can be used and they are forward chaining, backward chaining, and total task chaining (not to be confused with a task analysis).\n\nIn order to implement a behavior chain procedure, first you must recognize all the steps in the chain you wish to teach. To do so, you conduct a task analysis which can be done in one of three ways. The first way is for you to ask someone who is an expert on the task what all the steps involved are. The second is to watch someone do the chain who is competent enough to complete it and list all the steps you see. The last, and most common way it is done, is to complete the behavior chain yourself and outline the steps that you did. Task analysis can be as detailed as necessary depending on the ability of the learner.\n\nFor example, a task analysis of hanging up a shirt for a typically developing 10-year-old may be to first grab a hanger, grab a shirt, put the hanger in the hole for the head, then hang it in the closet. For an atypically developing 10-year-old, it may be get a hanger, grab a shirt, hold the hanger by the hook, put one side of the hanger in the head hole, put the other side of the hanger in the head hole, then hang up the shirt in the closet.\n\nTypically, the task analysis will have three parts outlined for each step, the SD associated, the behavior, and the outcome which serves as the reinforcer for the previous step and SD for the next step. Using the hanging up a shirt example again, the SD for putting the hanger in the head hole is holding a shirt and a hanger, the behavior is putting the hanger in the hole, and the reinforcer/SD for the next step is holding the hanger with the shirt held on it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are three different chaining procedures: forward chaining, backward chaining, and total task chaining. Although the research has not concluded which procedure is best, the procedure that you use will be determined by the skillset of the learner as well as the what works best for the learner. The whole point of using chaining is to teach a complex behavior by breaking it into multiple, easier steps that when done in order create the complex behavior. For example, washing hands is a complex behavior that can be broken down into 7 easy steps: turn on water, get hands wet, get soap, scrub hands, rinse hands, turn off water, dry hands.\n\nForward chaining is a procedure where the learner completes the first step in the chain and then is prompted through the remaining steps in the chain. Once the learner is consistently completing the first step, you have them complete the first and second step then prompt the remaining steps and so on until the learner is able to complete the entire chain independently. Reinforcement is delivered for completion of the step, although they do not attain the terminal reinforcer (outcome of the behavior chain) until they are prompted through the remaining steps.\n\nBackward chaining is just like forward chaining but starting with the last step. The tutor will prompt the learner through all the steps in the chain except the last one. The learner will complete the last step in the behavior chain independently and once they are doing so consistently, you can begin to have them do the second to last step and the last step and so on until they complete all the steps in the chain independently. The biggest benefit of using a backwards chain is that the learner receives the terminal reinforcer (the outcome of the behavior chain) naturally. Backward chaining is the preferred method when teaching skills to individuals with severe delays because they complete the last step and see the direct outcome of the chain immediately rather than having to be prompted through the remaining steps to receive that reinforcement.\n\nTotal task chaining is a procedure where you allow the learner to try to independently complete each step in the chain and if they don’t complete the step correctly, then the tutor will prompt the learner through that step then, again, allow them to independently complete the next step. Total task chaining can be used for individuals who know how to complete all the steps in a chain but don’t know how to do them in the correct order. Typically, it is used with individuals who do not have severe impairments and when the chain is not very long.\n\nWhen an error occurs at any point in the behavior chain, there is a procedure which should typically be followed. Of course, this is a case by case situation, but typically at the point of error, you will want to take one step back and complete the step before the error occurred and then prompt the following step that the error happened at. Ideally, you would then be able to go back to the step before the error occurred and have them do that step and the following step independently. For example, if with washing hands the learner makes an error when rubbing their hands, you will have them get soap again and then prompt them to scrub their hands. After, again depending on the client and person who is in charge of the program, you will want to have them get soap again and see if they independently scrub their hands.\n\nThe reason you go one step back instead of just prompting the step that was wrong is because you want to create the associations with that previous step and performing the next step correctly. You want the learner to know that, for example with washing hands and getting the scrubbing step wrong, seeing the soap in their hands means that they need to scrub their hands together. If you just prompt them to scrub their hands without them getting the soap first, then you may run into the issue of them not knowing that they need to scrub with soap. Additionally, you run the risk of adding incorrect steps into your chain if you prompt without completing the previous step. Using the same example, if the learner gets soap then rinses it off and you regularly prompt them to rub their hands together without getting soap, they may add the step of rinsing the soap off their hands before scrubbing to the chain.\n\n"}

It is probably the oldest surviving multi-level fully cast-iron framed building in the world, being three years earlier than the Menier Chocolate Factory in Noisiel, France, which are both amongst the few ever built. Named after its original owner, John Watson, the cast and wrought iron structure of the building was prefabricated in England, and it was constructed between 1867–69.\n\nThe hotel was leased on 26 August 1867 for the terms of 999 years at yearly rent of Rupees 92 and 12 annas to Abdul Haq. It was closed in the 1960s and was later subdivided and partitioned into smaller cubicles that were let out on rent as homes and offices. Neglect of the building has resulted in decay and, despite its listing as a Grade II–A heritage structure, the building is now in a dilapidated state. A documentary film about the building was made in 2019 called \"The Watson's Hotel\".\n\nWatson's Hotel was designed by the civil engineer Rowland Mason Ordish, who had worked on the Crystal Palace in London in 1850, and went on to design a number of cast and wrought-iron structures such as bridges and market halls, notably the Albert Bridge in London the St Pancras Station station roof (co-designer). The building's cast iron and wrought-iron components were prefabricated in England, and assembled on site. The iron frame is composed of relatively large-scale pieces, heavier than that used on the Crystal Palace, able to support the five levels, timber and tile floors, and the infill brick walling. \n\nThe design responded to the tropical environment by placing the access on external cantilevered walkways that surround the main facades, and incorporating a large lightwell behind.\n\nThe Menier Chocolate Factory in Noisiel, France, designed by architect Jules Saulnier, is often credited as the first multi-story building with a structure entirely composed of cast-iron, but it was built three years later, completed in 1872.\n\nJohn Hudson Watson was born in 1818 in Castle Carrock, England to a farming family. He ran a successful drapery business in Bombay. His original plan for the building was to use it as additional office and showroom for his thriving drapery and tailoring businesses nearby. started to begin to ship prefabricated cast iron components from England as early as October 1865. The hotel was built between 1867 and 1869. The original design, as displayed on the painting in the Watson Institute, included plans for traditional European mansard roof, however it was never built.\n\nJohn Watson opened the hotel as an exclusive Europeans-only hotel, and it was one of the most renowned hotels in the city in those days. Then it was handed over to Hannah Maria Watson, by then the Secretary of State for India, wherein she entered into a lease deed with Sardar Abdul Haq, Diler ul Mulk, Diler ul Daula, for a term of nine hundred and ninety nine years on 26 August 1867.\nLater on, another indenture was made on the date 22-12-1885, between the trustees of Port Trust of Bombay and Sardar Diler ul Mulk in which land on the Wellington Reclamation Estate in island of Bombay admeasurement of 8129 sq.yards. was leased by the Sardar Abdul Haq for a term of fifty years from 01-01-1880.\nThe five-storied structure housed 130 guest rooms, as well as a lobby, restaurant and a bar at the ground level. The hotel also had a atrium, originally used as a ballroom, with a glass skylight. At its peak, Watson's hotel employed English waitresses in its restaurant and ballroom, inspiring a common joke at the time: \"If only Watson had imported the English weather as well.\"\n\nBy 1920, Watson's ceased to be a hotel and had been renamed Mahendra Mansion. It 1944, it was renamed Esplanade Mansion. In 1960 it was converted into housing and offices accommodating.\n\nAfter Watson's death, the hotel lost its popularity to the rival Taj Hotel. In the 1960s the hotel was closed. Sometime after this, it was subdivided and partitioned into small cubicles with independent access and let out on rent. Over the years, apathy toward the building by the residents has resulted the building decaying, and it is now in a dilapidated state. The atrium was subsequently used as a dumping ground and has several illegal constructions. , building had 53 families and 97 commercial establishments. Most of the commercial establishments are chambers of lawyers attached to the adjacent Bombay Civil & Session Courts and the nearby Bombay High Court.\n\nSadik Ali, current owner of Esplanade Mansion, came to be the proprietor in early 80s after the building's then owners, the Tatas, sold it to him. He plans to redevelop the building in partnership with the tenants (it is virtually impossible for long term tenants to be removed in India).\n\nAmong the hotel's notable guests was Mark Twain, who wrote about the city's crows he saw outside his balcony in \"Following the Equator\". It was also the first place in India to screen the Lumière Brothers' Cinematographe invention in 1896.\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah used to play pool in the hotel, to make a little extra money for himself.\n\nA popular myth surround the hotel was that the staff at Watson's Hotel denied Indian industrialist Jamsetji Tata access to the hotel. In retaliation he built the Taj Hotel, a hotel that stands near the Gateway of India, in 1903. However many historians, notably author Sharada Dwivedi, dispute this legend on the basis of a lack of evidence to prove that \"Tata was a man of vengeance\".\n\nThe building's poor structural condition has been commonly remarked, and efforts by heritage activists to persuade its present owner to invest in restoration have been unsuccessful. One of the possible reasons proffered for apathy is the fact that the rent collected is low, as it has been frozen by government legislation. The current state of the building was publicized by Italian architect Renzo Piano, and as a result of his efforts, the building was listed in June 2005 on the list of \"100 World Endangered Monuments\" by the World Monuments Fund, a New York-based NGO. Just a few days after its nomination, part of the building's western façade, originally balconies developed into small offices, collapsed, killing one person and crushing several cars and motorcycles parked in the street below. The building is listed as a Grade II–A heritage structure. On 13 June 2010, the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) gave its approval for the 130-year-old structure to be restored. The restoration work will be carried out by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA).\n\nIn further development the condition of the structure was studied by a panel from IIT, wherein they observed \"Repairs will be dangerous as many structural elements of the building are not rigidly connected to each other.. it will be prudent to demolish Esplanade Mansion\". Bombay high court and subsequently Supreme court took note of this finding and recommendation of IIT Panel and have given orders to vacate the building for demolition.\n\n"}

Three years later, in 2019, the company announced plans to relocate its headquarters back to Atlanta. \n\nThe Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods.\n\nIn 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than any other manufacturer.\n\nThe F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze–plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, New York.\n\nThe company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Illinois in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.\n\nDuring World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy \"E\" award for excellence in wartime production.\n\nDaniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965, and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.\n\nThe Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974, they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.\n\nIn 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Illinois.\n\nIn 1983, the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.\n\nIn 1992, they acquired Sanford, a manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men's grooming accessories.\n\nIn 1997, the company acquired Kirsch, a company involved with drapery hardware and custom window coverings.\n\nIn 1998, the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, a cookware maker operating in South America.\n\nIn 2016, Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nNewell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen (relocating them to Nantes, France, and China) as well as toolmakers Berol, Record and Marples.\n\nNewell Sistema products has been criticized for requiring workers in their Auckland, New Zealand factory to work in unsafe conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak and lock down without adequate distances between workers and proper personal protective equipment. After a WorkSafe NZ visit workers were told they would not have to go to work and would be on full pay for the 4 week lock down.\n\nIn 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. \n\nAccording to the November 10, 2004 \"Frontline\" documentary series' \"Is Wal-Mart Good for America?\" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products, shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality.\n\nDespite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart, citing its strict commitment to its \"everyday low price\" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.\n\nHowever, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the \"merger from hell\" by \"Businessweek\" magazine. Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.\n\nIn 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.\n\nIn 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.\n\nIn 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools, and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.\n\nIn 2005, the company acquired DYMO, designing, manufacturing, and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage company Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO. The company added the slogan of \"Brands That Matter\" to their logo to emphasize the change.\n\nIn February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats, and other children's products and Technical Concepts, in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof. In July 2011, Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO.\n\nOn July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.\n\nOn October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.\n\nOn December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.\n\nIn 2014 Newell Rubbermaid sold Ashland Hardware Systems, Bulldog and Shurline.\n\nIn 2017, Newell sold K2 Sports, Völkl, Diamond Match Company, Levolor and Kirsch.\n\nIn January 2018, Newell announced that it would sell off several businesses, mostly former Jarden units, as part of a refocusing effort. In May 2018, Newell sold Waddington to Novolex. In June 2018, Newell sold Rawlings to Seidler Equity Partners. In August 2018, Newell sold Goody to ACON Investments. In November 2018, Newell sold its Pure Fishing line of business to Sycamore Partners for $1.3 billion and Jostens to Platinum Equity for $1.3 billion.\n\nIn June 2019, Newell Brands announced the sale of the United States Playing Card Company to Belgian card manufacturer Cartamundi Group.\n\nNewell's brands include the following.\n"}

Due to his difficult childhood, Benkovski had to drop out of school after finishing third grade in order to be trained as a tailor by his mother and make a living. Discontent with his job, he became a frieze dealer and left for Asia Minor together with a friend to sell their products, with little success. For some ten years Benkovski lived in various cities of the Orient, including Istanbul (Tsarigrad), İzmir (Smyrna) and Alexandria, engaging in various professions. His later stories describe his work as a bodyguard of the Persian consul, claiming his uniform was so beautiful people thought he was the consul himself. During his travels, Benkovski learned seven foreign languages to the level of basic competency: Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, Greek, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Persian.\n\nBenkovski became involved in the revolutionary activities of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee after meeting Stoyan Zaimov in Bucharest, Romania; he was also introduced to Vasil Levski and Hristo Botev's revolutionary and democratic ideas. In the summer of 1875, he joined a group of revolutionaries intending to set Constantinople on fire and assassinate sultan Abdülaziz.\n\nHe was given the French passport of a Polish \"émigré\", Anton Benkowski, whose family name he adopted as a pseudonym; he later changed his first name to Georgi. The Pole was an anti-Russian revolutionary who had attempted to assassinate the Russian governor of Warsaw and had to serve a life sentence on Sakhalin. Anton Benkowski managed to flee to Japan, where he acquired a passport and from where he fled to the Ottoman Empire. In Diyarbakır, the Pole met Zaimov and traded his French passport for five Turkish liras and the assistance to acquire an Ottoman passport.\n\nBenkovski was initially selected as Panayot Volov's assistant in the organization of the 4th Revolutionary District of the April Uprising, but due to his fervour and leadership qualities Volov conceded the position of head apostle to Benkovski voluntarily. Thanks to Benkovski's work, the insurrectional preparations developed best in this district.\n\nWhen the April Uprising broke out prematurely in Koprivshtitsa on , Benkovski was in nearby Panagyurishte along with most other apostles. Upon hearing that fighting has broken out in Koprivshtitsa, Benkovski formed an over-200-strong detachment and went to assist the insurrectionists. His detachment was known as \"The Flying Band\" (Хвърковата чета, \"Hvarkovata cheta\") because it toured the entire region tirelessly, mobilizing many insurgents and playing an important part in the fighting. The band was even joined by six Croats from Dalmatia and the German Albrecht, all workers at the Belovo railway station. One of the Croats, Stephen the Dalmatian, went to become the band's final standard-bearer. One woman also joined the band: Maria Ivanova-Sutić, the Bulgarian wife of a Croatian railway worker.\n\nIn the wake of the uprising's suppression, Benkovski and the surviving members of the band (Stephen the Dalmatian, Zahari Stoyanov and Father Kiril) headed to the Teteven Balkan Mountains. On , the band's location was betrayed by a local shepherd and the revolutionaries were ambushed by an Ottoman search party. Benkovski was shot dead in the Kostina area near Ribaritsa while crossing a river bridge. He was subsequently beheaded; his head was sent to Botevgrad and then to Sofia. The events were documented by Zahari Stoyanov and published in his \"Memoirs of the Bulgarian Uprisings\"; the author was the only one of the four who managed to escape.\n\nBenkovski Nunatak in Breznik Heights on Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Georgi Benkovski, as are six villages in Bulgaria and a neighbourhood of Sofia (the former villages of Birimirtsi and Obradovtsi). The Georgi Benkovski Stadium in Pazardzhik, the football club FC Benkovski Byala and the Bulgarian Air Force academy also bear his name.\n\n"}

Like the station's other broadcasters, Ruggiu incited violence against Tutsi and moderate Hutu over the air. Ruggiu eventually pleaded guilty to charges of incitement to commit genocide and in 2000 was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. An Italian-Belgian who became involved in Rwandan politics two years before the genocide, Ruggiu was the only non-Rwandan charged with involvement in the genocide.\n\nRuggiu's mother was a Belgian teacher, his father an Italian fireman. Until the age of 35 he lived at home and worked in Verviers, first as \"a counsellor for young drug addicts and then as a teacher for mentally handicapped children\". In 1992 he moved to the city of Liège, commuting to Brussels to work in a social security office. In Liège he \"befriended a Rwandan Hutu, was drawn into the Rwandan expatriate community and was soon seen in the company of Rwandan diplomats and officials of President Juvénal Habyarimana's party, the MRND\". He began visiting Rwanda and moved there in 1993.\n\nFrom January to July 1994, prior to and during the genocide, Ruggiu worked in Kigali, Rwanda, as a journalist and producer for Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM). Ruggiu had no experience in journalism and did not speak Kinyarwanda. RTLM was one of the chief sources of extremist Hutu propaganda, broadcasting twenty-four hours a day and openly exhorting its audience to kill Tutsis and \"disloyal\" Hutus. Ruggiu personally wrote and broadcast much content of this nature, relentlessly egging on his listeners that the \"graves were waiting to be filled\". Ruggiu personally broadcast programs inciting Hutus to commit murder or serious attacks against Tutsi rebels, whom he called \"cockroaches\". He also encouraged persecution of these Tutsi, and moderate Hutu and Belgian citizens in the area. Airtime filled by Ruggiu accounted for approximately 8% of RTLM's broadcasts.\n\nAlthough some of his defenders have suggested that Ruggiu did not know exactly what was going on around him in Rwanda, this opinion is sharply disputed by Rwandan Genocide scholar Alison Des Forges: \"It is beyond belief that Ruggiu did not know [what was going on] ... The tone of Mille Collines became more and more violent and witnesses say Ruggiu was living at the army barracks in Kigali and eating in the mess. He was hanging out with those that did the killing.\"\n\nAfter the genocide Ruggiu fled to refugee camps in Zaire and Tanzania and then to Kenya, where he converted to Islam and adopted the name Omar. He \"joined a Somali Muslim community in Mombasa\" and was \"on the verge of fleeing to Iraq\" when he was arrested by Kenyan police in 1997.\n\nOn July 23, 1997, Ruggiu was arrested in Mombasa at the request of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and moved to the site of the tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania. Ruggiu was charged with \"direct and public incitement to commit genocide\" and \"crimes against humanity (persecution)\". During his three-year-long trial, Ruggiu expressed regret for his part in events, saying, \"I admit that it was indeed a genocide and that unfortunately I took part in it.\" Ruggiu acknowledged his role in the genocide, admitting that he:\n\nHe accepted responsibility for his actions, stating \"certain people were killed in Rwanda in 1994 and that I was responsible and culpable\". Ruggiu detailed the inner workings of Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, stating the radio station was used to convey \"the ideology and plans of Hutu extremists in Rwanda\".\n\nOn May 15, 2000, Ruggiu pleaded guilty to both charges of indictment, and was sentenced to twelve years in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for incitement to commit genocide. He received a relatively short sentence, after agreeing to testify against three suspects who allegedly used the media, most notably RTLM, to fuel the genocide in Rwanda. Rwanda protested the sentence as inadequate.\n\nIn February 2008, Ruggiu was flown to Italy to serve out the rest of his 12-year sentence in his country of citizenship.\nOn 21 April 2009, Ruggiu was granted early release by the Italian authorities, a violation of the ICTR Statute.\n\n"}

The F2G was intended as a low-altitude interceptor and was equipped with a 28-cylinder, four-row Pratt & Whitney R-4360 air-cooled radial engine.\n\nSuch a fighter was first conceived in 1939, when Pratt & Whitney first proposed the immense, 3,000 hp (2,200 kW) R-4360, and design work began in early 1944, despite an oft-cited anecdote that the F2G was intended to intercept kamikazes (a tactic that was not widely used until late 1944).\n\nUsing experience gained building the F4U-1 under license – a variant known as the FG-1 – in early 1944, Goodyear modified a standard Corsair airframe to take advantage of the 50% increase in take-off power provided by the R-4360 engine. Known as the XF2G-1, the aircraft also featured a new all-round vision bubble-type canopy.\n\nA land-based variant, with manually-folding wings, was to be known as the F2G-1, while a carrier version with hydraulically-folding wings and arrestor hook was to be called the F2G-2. In March 1944, Goodyear was awarded a contract to deliver 418 F2G-1 and 10 F2G-2 aircraft.\n\nArmament was to include four or six wing-mounted 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and eight 5-inch (127 mm) rockets or two 1,000 or 1,600 lb (450 or 725 kg) bombs. The internal fuel capacity of the F2G was increased greatly over that of the F4U, and provisions were also made for two droptanks.\n\nHowever, post-production testing revealed deficiencies in lateral control and insufficient speed, which were bars to further development of the design. In addition, Grumman F8F Bearcat – a rival design that had also entered production – had performance comparable to the F2G, even though it was powered with the same engine as the original F4U. By the end of the war in August 1945, when only 10 aircraft (five examples of each variant) had been completed, further production of the F2G was canceled.\n\nXF2G-1: prototype. One converted from a standard FG-1 Corsair.\n\nF2G-1: land-based variant, 418 ordered, five built, order cancelled.\n\nF2G-2: carrier-based variant, 10 ordered, five built, order cancelled.\n\n\nOnly two \"Super Corsairs\" still remain, after the others crashed, and only one of them is in flying condition.\n\n\n"}

Sybil then became the founder and first National Coordinator of the National League of Families, a nonprofit organization that worked on behalf of American Vietnam-era Missing in Action and Prisoner of War Families. In her capacity as national coordinator for the League, she also served as its liaison to the White House and the Department of Defense.\n\nStockdale is credited with helping to better publicize the mistreatment of US prisoners by North Vietnam and for helping to improve American policies concerning the treatment and handling of POW families. Stockdale is the recipient of the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, the highest award given by the Department of the Navy to a citizen not employed by the Department. She is the only wife of an active-duty officer ever to have been so honored.\n\nStockdale was also the co-author, along with her husband, of the book \"In Love and War: the Story of a Family's Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam War\".\n\nHer husband, James Bond Stockdale, was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for bravery in war, and after his release at the end of the war, was eventually promoted to vice admiral and by the time of his death in 2005 was one of the United States' most honored and decorated military veterans in the post-World War II era. He was present at the August 4, 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Incident, spent 7 years under torture as a POW in North Vietnam, later became President of The Citadel, and eventually ran for Vice-President of the United States with Ross Perot heading the ticket.\n\nWhen Sybil Stockdale's husband James was shot down in 1965 over North Vietnam, the US government had a \"keep-quiet\" policy, asking relatives of POWs to not raise a fuss about mistreatment of prisoners. The official reason was not that the prisoners were not being tortured, but bad publicity might result in worse treatment.\n\nAfter a year of abiding by the government \"keep-quiet\" policy, Sybil found herself more and more disenchanted with the pretense that prisoners like her husband were treated fairly; James had been tortured, had inflicted serious wounds on himself to convince his captors they could not break or use him, and had spent years in solitary confinement.\n\nIn the summer of 1966, Sybil along with other members of a San Diego POW / MIA support group decided to go national, and formed the National League of Families of American Prisoners Missing in Southeast Asia. Sybil was the first national coordinator. Other support groups from east coast military communities later became part of the National League. \n\nWithin a year she was sitting in the office of the Secretary Of Defense Melvin Laird discussing policy.

Estimates of the number of Poles living in Germany vary from 2 million to about 3 million people living that might be of Polish descent. According to the latest census, there are approximately 2,006,410 Poles in Germany. The main Polonia organisations in Germany are the Union of Poles in Germany and Congress of Polonia in Germany. Polish surnames are relatively common in Germany, especially in the Ruhr area (Ruhr Poles).\n\nSince the Partitions of Poland in 1772, 1793 and 1795 and Poland's partial incorporation into Prussia, a large Polish ethnic group existed inside Prussia's borders, especially in the new provinces of Posen and West Prussia. Poles also settled in present-day Germany during the 18th century e.g. in Dresden and Leipzig. Dresden was named Royal-Polish Residential City after Augustus II the Strong became King of Poland in 1697.\n\nDuring the late 19th century rapid industrialisation in the Ruhr region attracted about 300,000 Poles, especially from East Prussia, West Prussia, Poznań, and Silesia. They comprised about 30% of the Ruhr area population by 1910. Kashubians and Masurians also came. Participants in this migration are called the Ruhr Poles.\n\nAfter 1870, the Poles were under an increasing pressure of Germanisation, and the Kulturkampf attacked their Catholic Church. Most Catholic bishops were imprisoned or exiled. The teaching language which had previously been Polish in the predominantly Polish-speaking areas in Prussia was replaced by German as teaching language, even in religious education where Polish priests were replaced by German teachers. However, these Germanisation policies were not at all successful. In contrast, it led to the political awakening of many Poles and to the establishment of a wealth of Polish economic, political and cultural associations which were aimed at preserving Polish culture and Polish interests, especially in the Province of Posen and in the Ruhr area. The policy of forced cultural Germanisation alienated large parts of the Polish-speaking population against the German authorities and produced nationalistic sentiments on both sides.\n\nAfter the First World War, the predominantly Polish provinces had to be ceded to the newly created Polish Republic. Polish-speaking minorities remained especially in Upper Silesia and parts of East Prussia. During the 1922 to 1937 term of the German-Polish Accord on Upper Silesia (Geneva Agreement), signed in Geneva on 15 May 1922, German nationals of Polish ethnicity in Upper Silesia had judicial status as a national minority under the auspices of the League of Nations (likewise the Poles of German ethnicity in the Polish Silesian Voivodeship). After the rise of the Nazis, all Polish activities were systematically constrained, since mid-1937 also in Upper Silesia. However, in August 1939, the leadership of the Polish community was arrested and interned in the Nazi concentration camps of Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald. On 7 September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, the Nazi government of the 3rd Reich stripped the Polish community in Germany of its minority status. This was formally confirmed by Hermann Göring's decree of 27 February 1940.\n\nToday the German government does not recognise German nationals of Polish ethnicity as a national minority. Polish agencies claim, that this way Germany is not recognising the right of self-determination for the group. After Poland joined the European Union, several organisations of Poles in Germany attempted to restore the pre-war official minority status, particularly claiming that the Nazi decree is void. While the initial memorandum to the Bundestag remained unanswered, in December 2009 the Minority Commission of the Council of Europe obliged the German government to formally respond to the demands within four months.\n\nThe position of the German government is, that after the German territorial losses after World War II, the current Polish minority has no century old roots in the remaining German territory, because Germany lost all the territories where people of German and Polish ethnicity overlapped. Since they are therefore only recent immigrants, they do not fulfill the requirements of a national minority according to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Treaty of Good Neighbourship. Being German citizens, they still retain all civil and political rights every German citizen possesses, and therefore can voice their will in the political system.\n\nAbout 10,000 Polish citizens have recently moved to German localities along the Polish-German border, depopulated after the unification of Germany.\n\nData of 2015:\n\n\n\n"}

In it, a judge who lacks compassion is repeatedly approached by a poor widow, seeking justice. Initially rejecting her demands, he eventually honors her request so he will not be worn out by her persistence.\n\nOne interpretation of this parable is that it demonstrates the importance of persistence in prayer, never giving up. It is found immediately prior to the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (also on prayer) and is similar to the Parable of the Friend at Night. Other scholars note that the content of the parable makes no reference to prayer and that the introduction of prayer as a theme is generally inspired by the Lucan construction in verses 6–8 and by the fact that Luke placed the parable of the Pharisee and Publican influentially after this one. Whatever approach is taken, it is noteworthy that the judge in the parable does not act on the basis of justice.\n\nLuke reports the parable as follows:\n\nThe framing material of the parable demonstrates the need to always pray like that persistent widow, for if even an unjust judge will eventually listen, God is much quicker to do so. The parable of the Friend at Night has a similar meaning.\n\nJoel B. Green sees in this parable an injunction not to lose heart, in the light of the eschatological tone of , and also an echo of Sirach 35: \"For he is a God of justice, who knows no favorites. ... The prayer of the lowly pierces the clouds; it does not rest till it reaches its goal, nor will it withdraw till the Most High responds, judges justly and affirms the right.\"\n\nWilliam Barclay says that the point of the parable is less about persistent prayer, but rather the contrast between God and men in the phrase \"how much more.\" In prayer one is speaking to a Father ready to give.\n\nDonald Parry and Jay A. Parry suggests that \"this parable applies to each of us who has adversaries that are harmful to our spiritual life, whether the adversaries are other mortals, evil beings, or particular sins that continue to plague us. We, like the importunate widow, must pray always for help against these adversaries. As we do, our Heavenly Father will hear our prayers and bring us deliverance.\" (Parry, Parry, Understanding the Parables of Jesus Christ, 2006) As Christ suggested in this parable the deliverance that is sought for may not be offered until after \"the Son of man cometh.\" () Christ will avenge his elect, those in whom have kept the faith until his return at the second coming ().\n\n"}

{"id": "2180348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180348", "title": "Milady de Winter", "text": "Milady de Winter\n\nMilady de Winter, often referred to as simply Milady, is a fictional character in the novel \"The Three Musketeers\" (1844) by Alexandre Dumas, père, set in 1625 France. She is a spy for Cardinal Richelieu and is one of the dominant antagonists of the story. Her role in the first part of the book is to seduce the English prime minister, the duke of Buckingham, who is also the secret lover of Queen Anne of France. Hoping to blackmail the queen, Richelieu orders Milady to steal two diamonds from a set of matched studs given to Buckingham by the queen, which were a gift to her from her husband, King Louis XIII. Thwarted by d'Artagnan and the other musketeers, Milady's conflict with d'Artagnan carries much of the second half of the novel.\n\nDescribed as being 22, tall, fair-haired and uncommonly beautiful, with brilliant blue eyes and black lashes and brows, Milady possesses a voice that can seduce and bewitch. \n\nA capable and intelligent French spy who effortlessly can pass as a native Englishwoman, Milady's beautiful exterior hides a diabolically cunning, ruthless and cruel interior; she is remorseless and unrepentant for her countless \"misdeeds\" and often described as appearing demonic and frighteningly ugly in the instant when she is thwarted in her aims. She is a classic example of a femme fatale.\n\nMilady later is revealed to be the wife of Athos, originally the Comte de la Fère, one of the three musketeers of the novel's title.\n\nLike Athos, who sheds his true identity as the Comte de la Fère when he joins the musketeers, Milady goes by numerous aliases, so that her identity is concealed for a good part of the novel. Athos first knows her as an adolescent Anne de Breuil, but because she already was concealing a scandalous and criminal past at that time, it was probably not her real name.\n\nAs a young Benedictine nun of 16, she seduced the convent's trusting priest. Urging him to steal the church's sacred vessels to finance a new life in another part of the country, they fled together and quickly were apprehended. Milady then seduced the jailer's son and escaped, leaving behind her first lover to be branded for theft. The executioner who had to brand the priest happened to be his brother, and blaming Milady for leading his brother astray, tracked her down on his own and branded her on the shoulder with the same fleur-de-lis symbol, marking her as a convicted criminal. The priest in turn escaped, and the lovers fled to a small town, where they posed as a country curate and his sister.\n\nThe village where they lived was part of Athos's lands, and he became captivated both by her beauty and her intellect. As seigneur of the county, he could have seduced her or taken her by force, but despite the opposition of his family and her obscure origins, he married her, giving her his wealth and title, and raising her to the nobility. While the pair were hunting in the forest one day, Milady fell from her horse and fainted. Cutting away her clothes so she could breathe, Athos discovered the convict brand on her shoulder. Dishonored, and having the right to dispense justice on his estates, Athos immediately hanged her from a tree. His wife's \"brother\", who had married the pair, fled before any retribution could be taken; Athos believes he only pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married in a secure position. For most of the novel, Athos assumes his deceitful wife is dead by his own hand, not knowing she survived the hanging and that she and Milady are the same person. Because the Comte de la Fère effectively ceases to exist when he becomes Athos, Milady makes the same mistake in presuming her first husband is dead.\n\nWhen d'Artagnan first spies Milady in Paris, she has married into English nobility some time previously by wedding Baron Sheffield, the younger brother of Lord de Winter. After she was made her husband's heir, he died violently and mysteriously within a matter of hours, leaving her a widow with a young child, who is Lord de Winter's only heir. Discovering that Milady is infatuated with Comte des Wardes, an equally infatuated d'Artagnan forges the count's reply to a love letter from Milady and arranges a nighttime rendezvous, where he impersonates des Wardes. During the assignation, Milady gives him, as des Wardes, a sapphire and diamond ring and swears to have d'Artagnan killed because he wounded the real des Wardes in a duel. She also reveals that she detests d'Artagnan for having spared her brother-in-law's life in another duel which lost her the income from her son's potential inheritance.\n\nWhen d'Artagnan later reveals to Milady that the tryst has been with him, not des Wardes, she attempts to kill him. In the struggle, her nightgown is torn, revealing the fleur-de-lis brand. Knowing that her terrible secret has been revealed to her enemy, Milady becomes resolved that d'Artagnan must die. Her attempts to secure his assassination lead to her eventual downfall. D'Artagnan escapes and immediately reports to Athos that Milady has a brand on her shoulder identical to one he discovered on his wife's body. When Athos hears this and identifies the ring Milady gave to d'Artagnan as his mother's, the former Comte de la Fère realizes that his wife is not dead after all.\n\nMilady tries many methods to murder d'Artagnan; while eavesdropping on a meeting between Richelieu and Milady, the musketeers hear that, in exchange for her assassination of Buckingham, Richelieu will undertake the task. Milady bargains with the cardinal and obtains a pardon that absolves her of future (unnamed) actions. It is not until Athos confronts her and forces her at pistol to relinquish the pardon that a horrified Milady realizes that the musketeer Athos is her first husband, the Comte de la Fère. Athos refrains from killing her, instead leaving her with no choice but to be escorted to England on her murderous mission, but without the cardinal's pardon.\n\nThe musketeers then warn Lord de Winter that not only has his sister-in-law made previous attempts on his life, but that her first husband is still alive, invalidating her marriage to his late brother. They also attempt to foil Milady's plot against Buckingham by having de Winter warn him. Upon arriving in England, Milady is arrested and imprisoned in a house by de Winter, who has suspected that she poisoned his younger brother. He chooses for her jailer a man he thinks will be impervious to her charms, the straitlaced Puritan John Felton. However, Milady persuades Felton that she is actually a Puritan as well, and that Buckingham is persecuting her because she refused his advances. Felton has his own grievances against Buckingham, whom he blames for his lack of promotion in the army, and succumbs to her will. He then proceeds to murder the duke (an actual historical event), but then is aghast to see Milady's ship sailing away without him. He later is hanged for the crime.\n\nReturning to France, Milady murders d'Artagnan's lover, then flees. The musketeers and Lord de Winter hunt Milady and track her to Lille, where they try her among themselves for her numerous crimes, including the poisoning of de Winter's brother. Athos finally charges her with deceiving him, hiding the fact that she was a convicted criminal when he married her. Milady defies anyone to produce any proof that she ever was sentenced for a crime. To her horror, the executioner of Lille steps forward to reveal himself as the man who branded her.\n\nWhen his priest brother escaped from jail to follow Milady, the executioner was condemned to serve his brother's sentence for him. On learning this later, the disgraced priest returned and surrendered himself, only to hang himself in his cell that same night. The executioner reveals that, rather than having schemed to marry her to a count, his brother was abandoned when Milady left him to marry Athos. (This seems to be at odds with Athos' earlier assertion that her \"brother\" married the pair.)\n\nThis final evidence condemns Milady to death, and she is beheaded by the executioner.\n\nAs the true identity of the Comte de la Fère is concealed by the name Athos, Milady's true identity is hidden by various names throughout the novel:\n\nIn the sequel \"Twenty Years After\", Milady's son Mordaunt, now 23, takes her role as one of the chief antagonists. As twisted and as deceitful as his mother, he sets about avenging her death, posing as a monk and murdering the executioner of Lille while taking his confession. He also murders Lord de Winter, Milady's brother-in-law, who raised him after the death of his mother.\n\nMordaunt later becomes involved in the English Civil War and commits regicide, executing King Charles I, in spite of the efforts of d'Artagnan and the three former musketeers to prevent it. D'Artagnan and his friends later confront Mordaunt at Cromwell's London residence, but in the course of a duel, he escapes through a secret passage.\n\nThe musketeers and their menservants leave England by ship, but Mordaunt sneaks aboard and blows it up. As the survivors escape in a rowboat, Mordaunt pleads for them to help him aboard, accusing them of killing him as they killed his mother. With the exception of Athos, they contemptuously reject his appeals. Athos insists on saving him, but as he helps him into the boat, Mordaunt deliberately drags him back into the water where they struggle, and Mordaunt is killed.\n\nThe character of Milady previously appeared in the \"Mémoires de M. d'Artagnan\" (1700), a historical novel by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras, which Dumas discovered during his research for his history of Louis XIV. In Courtilz's novel (one of the literary sources for the more famous novel by Dumas), Milady is one of the exiled English Queen Henrietta Maria's ladies-in-waiting. Dumas changed Milady's background significantly; from another Courtilz novel (\"Mémoires de M. le Comte de Rochforte\", 1687) Dumas partly derived the idea of the branded woman, which he applied to his version of Milady.\n\nThere appears to be a possible historical precedent for the character of Milady: The memoirs of François de La Rochefoucauld and Hubert de Brienne, Comte de Conflans as well as Volume I of \"Chroniques de l'Œil de Bœuf\" by Touchard-Lafosse describe Milady's antagonistic role in the diamond studs plot which Dumas reworked in \"The Three Musketeers.\" In La Rochefoucauld's volume, Milady is the Countess of Carlisle, in de Brienne's version she is Lady Clarick de Winter, and in Touchard-Lafosse's history she is Lady de Clarick. Milady - or rather, her historical/literary precursors - play relatively minor roles in Courtilz's novel and the other memoirs and pseudo-memoirs. While her theft of the diamond studs and other activities in the first half of \"The Three Musketeers\" are accounted for in the earlier works that Dumas borrowed, her machinations in the second half of the book are largely Dumas' invention.\n\nIn the introduction to his 1952 English translation of \"The Three Musketeers\", Lord Sudley posits the following:\n\nSudley goes on to suggest that Dumas might have found inspiration for Milady from the Chevalier d'Éon, a transgender spy who acted as Louis XV's secret envoy to Russia and England. D'Éon spent half of his life as a man and half as a woman, and was accused of actual physical hermaphroditism during their lifetime. One of Dumas' collaborators, F. Gaillardet, wrote the \"Mémoires sur la Chevaliére d'Éon\", of which Dumas is known to have owned a copy. However, Sudley concedes that the idea of d'Éon being an inspiration for Milady de Winter \"is, of course, pure conjecture, impossible to prove or disprove.\"\n\nActresses who have played Milady on screen include:\n\n\nIn the cartoon version \"Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds\", Milady is a female cat while most of the characters are dogs. With the exception of her real name (Countess de Winter), her origins never were revealed. It was hinted that 'only one man' knows of her past.\n\nIn the movie \"The Return of the Musketeers\", Kim Cattrall plays Milady's daughter Justine de Winter as a female version of Mordaunt.\n"}

After wrestling in Mid-Atlantic throughout the rest of 1977 and in early 1978, Irwin debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation on March 14, 1978 as one half of The Yukon Lumberjacks, where he was given the ring name \"Lumberjack Eric\" and his tag team partner, Zarinoff Lebeouf, was given the ring name \"Lumberjack Pierre\". Soon after debuting, The Lumberjacks wrestled against Dino Bravo and Dominic DeNucci for the WWF Tag Team Championship on June 2, but the match ended in a double disqualification. The Lumberjacks continued their feud with Bravo and DeNucci, and after several unsuccessful title rematches, the Lumberjacks finally defeated them for the title on June 26.\n\nThe Lumberjacks continued their success by retaining their title in several matches over the next several months against the likes of Bravo and DeNucci, Gorilla Monsoon and S.D. Jones and Haystacks Calhoun and Tony Garea. On November 21, The Lumberjacks lost their title Garea and Larry Zbyszko. After the title loss, Pierre retired from wrestling and Eric left the WWWF.\n\nAfter leaving the WWWF, Irwin debuted in Championship Wrestling from Florida in December 1978 as \"Thor the Viking\", with Oliver Humperdink as his manager. While in FCW, Irwin found championship success and wrestled his final match as Thor on October 14, 1979, with a victory over Steve Keirn. The following month, Irwin returned to the CWF as the masked \"Super Destroyer\", and went on to win a tag team match with Stan Lane against Keirn and Mike Graham.\n\nIrwin continued to use the Super Destroyer character in the CWF throughout the rest of 1979 before debuting in Mid-South Wrestling on November 27, 1980, in a losing effort to Ted DiBiase. Irwin, as the Super Destroyer, returned to Mid-South on April 18, 1981, and won the tag team championship with the Grappler after defeating Dick Murdoch and the Junkyard Dog in the finals of a tournament to claim the vacant title. However, the Destroyer and the Grappler lost the tag team title days later to Murdoch and JYD, on April 27. Soon after the title loss, Destroyer rebounded by winning the Louisiana Heavyweight Championship on May 1. He held the title for over two months before losing it to Bob Roop on July 22. Irwin continued to perform as the Super Destroyer upon joining the Continental Wrestling Association, and soon formed a successful tag team with the Masked Superstar.\n\nThe team soon jumped ship to Georgia Championship Wrestling, and continued their success by winning the NWA National Tag Team Championship on January 22, 1982 from The Armstrongs (Bob and Brad). Beginning in March, the Superstar gave his half of the title to Big John Studd. On July 2, Super Destroyer and Studd lost the title to The Fabulous Freebirds. After the title loss, Super Destroyer returned to singles competition before he formed The Super Destroyers tag team with his real-life brother Bill Irwin. Bill became Super Destroyer No. 1 while Scott became Super Destroyer No. 2, and the brothers won their first NWA American Tag Team Championship from Bulldog Brower and Roddy Piper in October 1983. Soon after debuting, they acquired Skandor Akbar as a manager. The Destroyers lost the title to Brian Adias and Iceman King Parsons on December 25 before regaining it on January 30, 1984. The Destroyers held the title for four months before losing it to Rock 'n' Soul (Parsons and Buck Zomhofe). The Destroyers quickly rebounded and won the title back thirteen days later, but after the match, Rock 'n' Soul unmasked them.\n\nAfter being unmasked, the brothers dropped the Destroyers aspect of their team and instead began wrestling under their real names while their tag team was renamed to the \"Long Riders\". The Riders continued their feud with Rock 'n' Soul and lost the title to them again, on August 4, after Parsons defeated Bill in a singles match. The Riders won the American Tag Team Title for the fourth and final time on September 28 after defeating Rock 'n' Soul. The brothers soon lost the title to the Fantastics (Tommy Rogers and Bobby Fulton) on October 22.\n\nOn November 18, Irwin returned to Georgia Championship Wrestling and, with his brother, defeated Brad Armstrong and Jacques Rougeau in the finals of a one-night tournament to win the NWA National Tag Team Championship. The next night, the Long Riders retained their newly won title against Armstrong and Tommy Rich. On January 11, 1985, the Riders lost the title to Ole Anderson and Thunderbolt Patterson. After the Riders lost a rematch for the title the following night, Scott faced Anderson and Patterson in two subsequent rematches with Kareem Muhammad and then Doug Somers as his partners, due to Bill leaving GCW, but was unable to win either rematch. Irwin wrestled a few more matches in GCW before leaving the promotion.\n\nThe Long Riders soon sprang up in the American Wrestling Association later in mid-1985, where they lost their debut match to the Road Warriors for the Warriors' tag team championship on July 14. On September 28, the Riders and Harley Race lost to Genichiro Tenryu, Giant Baba and Jumbo Tsuruta in a six-man tag team match at SuperClash. The Riders continued in the AWA until April 20, 1986, where they lost a tag team title match to Curt Hennig and Scott Hall at WrestleRock.\n\nOn September 5, 1987, Irwin died from a brain tumor. He was 35 years old.\n\n\n"}

The centre provides lodges, chalets and campsites covering 17 hectares of land. It is open to Scouts year round, as well as to non-Scouts for most of the year. More than 11,000 young people from over 50 different countries visit the centre every year\n\nKISC is the World Organization of the Scout Movement's (WOSM) World Scout Centre.\n\nIn 1921 the Chief Scout of Switzerland, Walther von Bonstetten, visited Kandersteg on holiday and found an old empty chalet. It was built in 1908 to house the construction workers for the Lötschberg Tunnel. In 1913, when the tunnel was finished, the chalet was left unused by the railway company. Von Bonstetten felt that this location could be the permanent international meeting place that Robert Baden-Powell had in mind where Scouts from all over the world could meet. Von Bonstetten wrote to him to let him know what he had found. The response was positive and on 12 February 1923 the Scouts International Home Association was set up; on 12 April 1923 the chalet and adjacent land were bought for CHF 15,100, and the International Scout Centre came into existence. In 1930 Baden-Powell visited the site himself.\n\nUp to current times, the site has continuously been augmented, with the first national room, 'the Dutch room' in 1927, and the purchase of additional land in 1929. During World War II, the centre was used to house French soldiers interned for the war. In the 1950s more property was purchased, including the woods by the river Kander, and the centre began to open also in the wintertime. The centre was renamed Kandersteg International Scout Centre in 1977. In the 1980s, new campsites were created, together with extra toilet facilities, although the centre went through a difficult time financially. In 1994, the \"International Scout Centre Foundation, Kandersteg\" was established, and work started on the chalet extension project which opened on 1 June 1996. On December 2002, the top floor of the New Chalet was finished, completing the chalet extension, followed by new bathroom renovations two years later. In 2009, the centre opened a new accommodation building named Kander-Lodge, purchased the neighbouring building, Sunneblick, and fully renovated the ground floor of the Old Chalet.\n\nThe small, traditional Swiss village of Kandersteg (inhabitants approximately 1,200) is situated at 1,200 metres above sea level, 65 kilometres south of Bern, in the canton of Bern, near the Lötschenpass and the Gemmipass. The village is known for sightseeing and exploring the Swiss Alps. Kandersteg can be reached by road and rail: it is situated on the main railway line from the north to Italy, and the station is served by fast trains.\n\nThe Scout Centre is at the southern end of the village. During high season, a regular bus runs from the local railway station.\n\nThe central part of the centre is the chalet, which consists of two parts, the Old Chalet and the New Chalet. This building houses the centre reception and offices, as well as facilities for guests. The completion of the extension in 1996 greatly increased its size, and it has full central heating, modern sanitary facilities with constant hot water, a souvenir shop, meeting rooms, postal service, public telephones, a coffee bar, a laundry, a first aid room and internet facilities. There are five fully equipped electric kitchens available for use.\n\nThe Chalet is open all year round and is run along much the same lines as most Youth Hostels, with an emphasis on community life and cooperation. Guests help to look after and clean the building. The Chalet is decorated with scarves and plaques from guests, as well as photos, posters and badges showing the worldwide family of Scouting.\n\nThe \"Old Chalet\" provides accommodation for 172 people in 23 rooms, each with between 3 and 22 beds. Most rooms have tables and chairs, providing a living area. The rooms are named after National Scout Organizations or Scout Regions that have helped with renovating and decorating the room. The \"New Chalet\" provides new staff accommodation, meeting rooms and upgraded accommodation for 27 people in nine triple -bedded bedrooms available outside the summer season.\n\nThe campsite can accommodate up to 1,400 persons on more than 60 different sites. On average during the summer, the site has around 750 guests at a time. While close to other groups, each group can be sure of their own campsite, ensuring both an international atmosphere and privacy. The sites have running water nearby and there are toilets and showers with hot water close at hand, which the visiting groups help to look after during their stay. There is a shop open on the campsite during the summer and a campsite office that is open most of the time. There is also a drying room and multiple picnic and barbecue facilities.\n\nThe campsite was originally wasteland from the construction of the tunnel, so several sites are rocky. The railway runs close to some of the sites, so it can be noisy at times.\n\nThe \"Tower\" was originally the power station when the railway was built and now has two parts: the tower itself and the \"Lötschberghaus\" (sleeping building). In total there is accommodation for 57 people - four rooms with 12 beds in the Lötschberghaus and a newly renovated room with nine beds in the tower. Facilities include full toilet and shower facilities for boys and girls, a fully equipped electric kitchen and a big living room with an open fireplace and balcony.\n\nOn the other side of the river Kander is the \"Kander Lodge\", facing the Chalet. It has eighteen simple 2-bed rooms with shared bathrooms. The building has a kitchen, dining room, living room and meeting room. The building was originally erected in the nearby village of Mitholz, and in recent decades used as office and exhibition space for the Lötschberg Base Tunnel. In 2008, after the tunnel was opened, the lodge was moved from Mitholz to its current site in Kandersteg.\n\nPurchased in 2009, the \"Sunneblick\" is an old chalet with the same history as the Old Chalet and the Kander-Lodge. Originally it was an accommodation building for workers on the train tunnel in Frutigen. In the first quarter of the 20th century, it was moved from Frutigen to Kandersteg, to be the direct neighbour of the Old Chalet. The Sunneblick has 47 beds, a dining/play/meeting room, a fully equipped kitchen and a sitting room. It is available for use by a single group or can be rented as individual rooms.\n\nThe \"Ueschinen Hut\" is situated in the Ueschinen Valley, at a height of 1,890 metres, and about two to three hours' walk away from the centre. It is usually open from May to October. During the summer it is used mainly as a base for climbing and hiking activities, but it may be used by groups at any time if weather allows. The hut is actually half of a cowshed, so sometimes it is a bit noisy at night. It can sleep up to 30 people and has a fully equipped kitchen with wood stove, a general living and eating room and a special toilet – there is no electricity and no shower.\n\nThe site has a history of camps, starting with the 50th Gilwell Scout course, organized in 1926, and the 1st World Scout Moot with 2,500 Rover Scouts from 23 countries in 1931. After the war, in 1953, the 5th World Scout Moot was back in Kandersteg with 4,000 Rovers from 22 countries, and in 1992 again the 9th World Scout Moot saw nearly 2,500 people from over 50 countries.\n\nIn 1979, the site hosted Camp Kristall, with 1,700 Scouts from 42 countries. The camp was one of those that replaced the cancelled 15th World Scout Jamboree that year. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Transatlantic Council of the Boy Scouts of America used Kandersteg for annual and even more frequent camps. In 2007, the centre played host to KanderJam, 'The Alpine Link to the 21st World Scout Jamboree', which brought over 2,000 people from all over the world in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Scouting. The year after that, in 2008, the centre ran the first ever World Scout Winter Games.\n\nThe activity programme offered by the Centre is based on three themes of International Friendship, High Adventure and Eco Adventure, designed to help guests learn, develop and have lots of fun. In the summer they offer, within the three themes, a fixed weekly in-camp programme including International Campfire, Pioneering Competition and BBQ, as well as a wide range of daily activities such as trails, nature workshops, hiking, rock climbing, crafts, mountain biking, paragliding, river rafting and trips to various parts of Switzerland. In the winter, the programme offers a range of alpine snow activities such as downhill or cross country skiing and snowboarding. There are also a variety of other activities in and around Kandersteg, like sledding, curling, ice skating, ice climbing and snow shoeing.\n\nThroughout the year, Kandersteg offers programme activities for groups. Options vary with season and exact time of the visit. By participating in the programme, guests can work towards the award that exists for each of the themes. These are designed to bring together guests of all ages, nationalities and cultures, while encouraging them to experience, learn about and appreciate the alpine environment.\n\nIn 1973, Kurt Metz was appointed as the first full-time director, thanks to the support of Kenneth Macintosh and the US Foundation for International Scouting. Since then the staff team has grown and operates throughout the year with the directors being assisted by deputy directors and an international team of volunteer staff staying from three months to several years. Volunteer staff are recruited in various numbers according to the time of year to assist with the running of the centre's facilities and the programme offered. The following is a list of KISC Directors (their country) and the year they took up the role.\n\nStaff uniform colour used to change each year but from 1989 red became pink and never changed again. From then on the staff members were known as \"pinkies\". As well as their pink T-shirts and sweatshirt, they also wear a neckerchief to represent their Scouting background. Staff must meet three conditions: a minimum age of 18 on the day of starting work, ability to communicate in English, and membership in World Organization of the Scout Movement or World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.\n\nNotable staff include Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards who worked as staff and trained in Kandersteg.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2180372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180372", "title": "Antebellum South", "text": "Antebellum South\n\nThe Antebellum South (also known as the antebellum era or plantation era) was a period in the history of the Southern United States from the late 18th century until the start of the American Civil War in 1861. This period in the South's history was marked by the economic growth of the region, largely due to its heavy reliance on slavery, and of its political influence on the U.S. federal government. It was also characterized by the rise of abolition and the gradual polarization of the country between abolitionists and supporters of slavery.\n\nSlavery was introduced to the South early in its history during colonial rule due to the demand for cheap labor for the harvesting of crops. It would persist through the 17th and 18th centuries but it was not until the invention of the Cotton Gin by Eli Whitney that slavery grew very profitable and that the large plantation system developed. In the decade and half between the invention of the Gin and the passage of the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, a enormous increase in the slave trade occurred, furthering the slave system in the United States. \n\nThe antebellum South saw large expansions in agriculture while manufacturing growth remained relatively slow. The southern economy was characterized by a low level of capital accumulation (largely labor-based) and a shortage of liquid capital, which, when aggravated by the need to concentrate on a few staples, the pervasive anti-industrial, and anti-urban ideology, and the reduction of southern banking, led to a South dependent on export trade. In contrast to the economies of the North and West, which relied primarily on their own domestic markets, because the southern domestic market consisted primarily of plantations, southern states imported sustenance commodities from the West and manufactured goods from the North.\n\nThe plantation system can be seen as the factory system applied to agriculture, with a concentration of labor under skilled management. But while the industrial manufacturing-based labor economy of the North was driven by growing demand, maintenance of the plantation economic system depended upon usage of slave labor that was both abundant and cheap.\n\nThe five major commodities of the southern agricultural economy were cotton, grain, tobacco, sugar, and rice, with the production of the leading cash crop, cotton, concentrated in the Deep South (Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana).\nThe leading historian of the era was Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, who studied slavery not so much as a political issue between North and South but as a social and economic system. He focused on the large plantations that dominated the South.\n\nPhillips addressed the unprofitability of slave labor and slavery's ill effects on the southern economy. An example of pioneering comparative work was \"A Jamaica Slave Plantation\" (1914). His methods inspired the \"Phillips school\" of slavery studies between 1900 and 1950.\n\nPhillips argued that large-scale plantation slavery was efficient and progressive. It had reached its geographical limits by 1860 or so, and therefore eventually had to fade away (as happened in Brazil). In 1910, he argued in \"The Decadence of the Plantation System\" that slavery was an unprofitable relic that persisted because it produced social status, honor, and political power. \"Most farmers in the South had small- to medium-sized farms with few slaves, but the large plantation owner’s wealth, often reflected in the number of slaves they owned, afforded them considerable prestige and political power.\"\n\nPhillips contended that masters treated slaves relatively well; his views on that issue were later sharply rejected by Kenneth M. Stampp. His conclusions about the economic decline of slavery were challenged in 1958 by Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer in a landmark study published in the \"Journal of Political Economy\". Their arguments were further developed by Robert Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman, who argued in their 1974 book, \"Time on the Cross,\" that slavery was both efficient and profitable, as long as the price of cotton was high enough. In turn, Fogel and Engerman came under attack from other historians of slavery.\n\nAs slavery began to displace indentured servitude as the principal supply of labor in the plantation systems of the South, the economic nature of the institution of slavery aided in the increased inequality of wealth seen in the antebellum South. The demand for slave labor and the U.S. ban on importing more slaves from Africa drove up prices for slaves, making it profitable for smaller farmers in older settled areas such as Virginia to sell their slaves further south and west. The actuarial risk, or the potential loss in investment of owning slaves from death, disability, etc. was much greater for small plantation owners. Accentuated by the rise in price of slaves seen just prior to the Civil War, the overall costs associated with owning slaves to the individual plantation owner led to the concentration of slave ownership seen at the eve of the Civil War.\n\nMuch of the antebellum South was rural and, in line with the plantation system, largely agricultural. With the exception of New Orleans and Baltimore, the slave states had no large cities, and the urban population of the South could not compare to that of the Northeast or even that of the agrarian West. This led to a sharp division in class in the southern states between the landowning, \"master\" class, poor whites, and slaves, while in the northern and western states, much of the social spectrum was dominated by a wide range of different laboring classes.\n\nThe conclusion that, while both the North and the South were characterized by a high degree of inequality during the plantation era, the wealth distribution was much more unequal in the South than in the North arises from studies concerned with the equality of land, slave, and wealth distribution. For example, in certain states and counties, due to the concentration of landholding and slave holding, which were highly correlated, six percent of landowners ended up commanding one-third of the gross income and an even higher portion of the net income. The majority of landowners, who had smaller scale plantations, saw a disproportionately small portion in revenues generated by the slavery-driven plantation system.\n\nWhile the two largest classes in the South included land- and slave-owners and slaves, various strata of social classes existed within and between the two. In examining class relations and the banking system in the South, the economic exploitation of slave labor can be seen to arise from a need to maintain certain conditions for the existence of slavery and from a need for each of the remaining social strata to remain in status quo. In order to meet conditions where slavery may continue to exist, members of the master class (e.g. white, landowning, slave-owning) had to compete with other members of the master class to maximize the surplus labor extracted from slaves. Likewise, in order to remain within the same class, members of the master class (and each subsumed class below) must expand their claim on revenues derived from the slave labor surplus.\n\nBritish mercantilist ideology largely explains the rise of the plantation system in the United States. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries under mercantilism, rulers of nations believed that the accumulation of wealth through a favorable balance of trade was the best way to ensure power. As a result, Britain began to colonize territories across the Atlantic to take advantage of their rich natural resources and encourage exports.\n\nOne example of Britain utilizing the colonies for economic gain was tobacco. When tobacco was first discovered as a recreational substance, there was a widespread social backlash in mainland England, spearheaded by King James himself. By the middle of the 17th century, however, the British government had realized the revenue potential of tobacco and quickly changed its official moral stance towards its use. As a result, tobacco plantations sprung up across the American South in large numbers to support European demand. Britain benefitted from the immense volume of tobacco that colonial plantations could produce. By 1670, more than half of all tobacco shipped to England was being re-exported to other countries throughout Europe at a premium. In similar ways Britain was able to profit from other American staple crops, such as cotton, rice, and indigo. As Russell Menard puts it, Britain's capitalizing on increased European demand for these crops \"fueled the expansion of the American plantation colonies, transformed the Atlantic into an English inland sea, and led to the creation of the first British Empire.\"\n\nMany claim that being a part of the British mercantilist system was in the best economic interest of the colonies as well, as they would not have been able to survive as independent economic entities. Robert Haywood, in his article \"Mercantilism and South Carolina Agriculture, 1700-1763\", argues that \"it was unthinkable that any trade could prosper in the straight-jacket of regimented and restricted international trade, without the guiding hand of a powerful protecting government.\"\n\nThe plantation era, while it was in large part the source of the South's initial economic prosperity, was also the reason why the South lagged in productivity starting in the early- to mid-19th century. Because the plantation system mainly required a large volume of unskilled labor, the South did not have the human capital to succeed when the plantation era was over. Ulrich Bonnell Phillips contends that the plantation \"sadly restricted the opportunity of such men as were of better industrial quality than was required for the field gangs.\" Essentially, men who would have been otherwise capable of performing other skilled jobs were nonetheless relegated to field work because of the nature of the system.\n\nAccording to the Goldin–Sokoloff hypothesis, in the South, the relative productivity of women and children was higher than in the North, since the relative abilities of a man, woman, or child to pick cotton or harvest tobacco are nearly the same. In the North, however, since the relative productivity of women and children was much lower, factory jobs became attractive, and there arose an abundant supply of labor to fuel the industrial boom. As a result of the misallocation of labor in the South, the system \"hindered all diversification in southern industry, and kept the whole community in a state of commercial dependence upon the North.\"\n\n"}

Both weapons were designed by Hungarian engineer Pál Király, who came to the Dominican Republic as an expatriate in 1948. The gun's name is a reference to the San Cristóbal Province, which is the birthplace of the late Dominican dictator, Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo. The Dominican Republic's military was the main user of this weapon although it was also exported to Cuba prior to the Cuban Revolution.\n\nThe Cristóbal had a wooden stock, 30-round bottom-mounted box magazine, and tubular receiver with a fixed cocking handle on the right-hand side. It used lever-delayed blowback for its operation. The original version was produced in 9×19mm Parabellum. The most typical version of the Cristóbal was made in .30 Carbine.\n\nOver 200,000 Cristóbals were made by the Armeria San Cristóbal from 1950 to 1966. After Trujillo’s assassination on May 31, 1961, the Dominican government decided not to maintain a local military industry and production was slowly wound down. By 1990, the Cristóbal was no longer a standard Dominican firearm, but continues to be used for basic training in the Dominican Republic's military schools.\n\nThis carbine was used by Che Guevara during the Cuban Revolution.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2180385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180385", "title": "Oechsle scale", "text": "Oechsle scale\n\nThe Oechsle scale is a hydrometer scale measuring the density of grape must, which is an indication of grape ripeness and sugar content used in wine-making. It is named for Ferdinand Oechsle (1774–1852) and it is widely used in the German, Swiss and Luxembourgish wine-making industries. On the Oechsle scale, one degree Oechsle (° Oe) corresponds to one gram of the difference between the mass of one litre of must at 20 °C and 1 kg (the mass of 1 litre of water). For example, must with a specific mass of 1084 grams per litre has 84° Oe.\n\nThe mass difference between equivalent volumes of must and water is almost entirely due to the dissolved sugar in the must. Since the alcohol in wine is produced by fermentation of the sugar, the Oechsle scale is used to predict the maximal possible alcohol content of the finished wine. This measure is commonly used to select when to harvest grapes. In the vineyard, the must density is usually measured by using a refractometer by crushing a few grapes between the fingers and letting the must drip onto the glass prism of the refractometer. In countries using the Oechsle scale, the refractometer will be calibrated in Oechsle degrees, but this is an indirect reading, as the refractometer actually measures the refractive index of the grape must, and translates it into Oechsle or different wine must scales, based on their correlation to refractive index.\n\nThe Oechsle scale forms the basis of most of the German wine classification. In the highest quality category, Prädikatswein (formerly known as \"Qualitätswein mit Prädikat\", QmP), the wine is assigned a \"Prädikat\" based on the Oechsle reading of the must. The regulations set out minimum Oechsle readings for each Prädikat, which depend on wine-growing regions and grape variety:\n\nThe sugar content indicated by the Oechsle scale only refers to the unfermented grape must, never to the finished wine.\n\nIn Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (KMW) scale is used. The scale is divided into Klosterneuburger Zuckergrade (°KMW), and very similar to the Oechsle scale (1° KMW =~ 5° Oe). However, the KMW measures the exact sugar content of the must.\n\nThe Baumé scale is occasionally used in France and by U.S. brewers, and in the New World the Brix scale is used to describe the readings of a refractometer when measuring the sugar content of a given sample. \n\nSince a refractometer actually measures the refractive index of the grape must, it can be translated to many different scales (both related and unrelated to wine) based on their correlation to refractive index. Thus, all of these methods are similar and the differences are more cultural than significant, but all are equally valid ways to measure the density of grape must and other sugar-based liquids.\n\nThe Normalizovaný Moštomer (°NM) measures kg of sugar in 100 l of must and is used in Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\n"}

{"id": "2180403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180403", "title": "Battle of Bloody Marsh", "text": "Battle of Bloody Marsh\n\nThe Battle of Bloody Marsh was a battle that took place on July 7, 1742, between Spanish and British forces on St. Simons Island, part of the Province of Georgia, resulting in a victory for the British. Part of a much larger conflict, the War of Jenkins' Ear, the battle was for the British fortifications of Fort Frederica and Fort St. Simons, with the strategic goal the sea routes and inland waters they controlled. With the victory, the Province of Georgia established undisputed claim to the island. It is now part of the U.S. state of Georgia. The British also won the Battle of Gully Hole Creek, which took place on the island the same day.\n\nJames Oglethorpe led the colonization of Georgia for Great Britain, and had chosen Savannah as the principal port for the new colony. In the 1730s, Spain and Great Britain were disputing control of the border between Georgia and \"La Florida,\" where the Spanish had several settlements and forts.\n\nGiven a heightened threat of Spanish invasion, Oglethorpe sought to increase his southern defenses. Accompanied by rangers and two Native American guides, Oglethorpe picked St. Simons Island as the site for a new town and fort. In 1734, Oglethorpe convinced the Parliament and the colonial trustees to pay for a military garrison at the fort.\n\nThe trustees also recruited a large group of colonists to settle St. Simons Island. The ships bearing the settlers and supplies arrived at Tybee Island early in 1736. From there, some went to the mainland while others traveled via \"periaguas\" (also known as \"pirogues\") to St. Simons Island to found Frederica. The town and its fort were built on the elbow of the Frederica River to control approaches from both directions.\n\nIn 1737, Oglethorpe returned to England to acquire more funding and permission to raise a regiment of soldiers; he gained Parliamentary approval for both. He was appointed commander-in-chief of all British forces (limited as they were) in the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia. Oglethorpe subsequently recruited a company of Scots from Inverness, to migrate with their families to settle at Darien (briefly named \"New Inverness\") on the mainland, at the mouth of the Altamaha River. The men formed a military unit known locally as the Highland Independent Company. Official British records list it as Oglethorpe's Regiment of Foot. It was ranked as 42nd Regiment of Foot (old) in 1747, and disbanded 29 May 1749 in Georgia.\n\nTwo forts had been constructed about five miles apart on St. Simons Island. Between the two ran a road the width of one wagon, named Military Road. This served to supply the garrison at Fort Frederica and settlers in the nearby village from Fort St. Simons.\n\nThe battles took place after a Spanish invasion of the island. They were part of the larger conflict known as the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739 to 1748). It derived its name from an incident in 1731. A Spanish boarding party had gone aboard a British brig \"Rebecca\", off the Florida coast, and found that its captain Robert Jenkins was smuggling. The Spanish officer cut off one of Jenkins' ears for piracy. Parliament used the nearly forgotten incident to rally public opinion to their side in 1739, but the war was due to trade and territorial competition between Britain and Spain. On October 30, 1739, Great Britain declared war on Spain.\n\nSpanish governor Don Manuel de Montiano commanded the invasion force, which by some estimates totaled between 4,500 and 5,000 men. Of that number, roughly 1,900 to 2,000 were ground assault troops. Oglethorpe's forces, consisting of regulars, militia, and native Indians, numbered fewer than 1,000. The garrison at Fort St. Simons resisted the invasion with cannonade, but could not prevent the landing.\n\nOn the 5 July 1742, Montiano landed nearly 1,900 men from 36 ships near Gascoigne Bluff, close to the Frederica River. Faced with a superior force, Oglethorpe decided to withdraw from Fort St. Simons before the Spanish could mount an assault. He ordered the small garrison to spike the guns and slight the fort (doing what damage they could), to deny the Spanish full use of the military asset. The Spanish took over the remains of the fort the following day, establishing it as their base on the island.\n\nAfter landing troops and supplies, and consolidating their position at Fort St. Simons, the Spanish began to reconnoiter beyond their perimeter. They found the road between Fort St. Simons and Fort Frederica, but assumed the narrow track was just a farm road. On the 7 July the Spanish undertook a reconnaissance in force along the road with approximately 115 men under the command of Captain Sebastian Sanchez. One and a half miles from Fort Frederica, Sanchez' column made contact with Oglethorpe's soldiers, under command of Noble Jones. The ensuing skirmish became known as the Battle of Gully Hole Creek. The British routed the Spanish, killing or capturing nearly a third of their soldiers. Oglethorpe's forces advanced along Military Road toward Fort St. Simons in pursuit of the retreating Spanish. When Spanish prisoners revealed that a larger Spanish force was advancing from the opposite direction toward Frederica, Oglethorpe left to gather reinforcements.\n\nThe British advance party, in pursuit of the defeated Spanish force, engaged in a skirmish, then fell back in face of advancing Spanish reinforcements. When the British reached a bend in the road, Lieutenants Southerland and Macoy ordered the column to stop. They took cover in a semi-circle shaped area around a clearing behind trees and palmettos, waiting for the advancing Spanish having taken cover in the dense forest. They watched as the Spanish broke rank, stacked arms and, taking out their kettles, prepared to cook dinner. The Spanish thought they were protected because they had the marsh on one side of them and the forest on the other. The British forces opened fire from behind the cover of trees and bushes, catching the Spanish off-guard. They fired multiple volleys from behind the protection of dense forest. \n\nThe attack killed roughly 200 Spaniards. The ferocity of the fighting at Bloody Marsh was dramatic, and the battle took its name from the tradition that the marsh ran red with the blood of dead Spanish soldiers. The floor of the forest was strewn with the bodies of the dead and dying. A few Spanish officers attempted in vain to reform their ranks, but the Spanish soldiers and their allies fled, panic stricken, in multiple directions as they were hit with volley after volley of musket fire from behind the foliage. Barba himself was captured after being mortally wounded. The \"Battle of Bloody Marsh\" blunted the Spanish advance, and ultimately proved decisive. Oglethorpe was credited with the victory, though he arrived at the scene after the fighting had ceased.\n\nOglethorpe continued to press the Spanish, trying to dislodge them from the island. A few days later, approaching a Spanish settlement on the south side, he learned of a French man who had deserted the British and gone to the Spanish. Worried that the deserter might report how small the British force was, Oglethorpe spread out his drummers, to make them sound as if they were accompanying a larger force. He wrote to the deserter, addressing him as if he were a spy for the British, saying that the man just needed to continue his stories until Britain could send more men. The prisoner who was carrying the letter took it to the Spanish officers, as Oglethorpe had hoped and the Spanish promptly executed the Frenchmen. The timely arrival of British ships reinforced a misconception among the Spanish that British reinforcements were arriving. The Spanish left St. Simons on 25 July, ending their last invasion of colonial Georgia.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Oglethorpe considered counter-attacks against Florida, but circumstances were not favourable. The focus of the war had shifted from the Americas to Europe; arms, supplies and troops were not readily available. The region settled into an uneasy peace, occasionally punctuated by minor skirmishes. Oglethorpe was later appointed brigadier general. About 1744 he left Georgia for Britain, where he married an heiress; he lived in Britain the rest of his life. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war in 1748 and recognised the status of Georgia as a British colony, formally ratified by Spain in the subsequent Treaty of Madrid. Its position was further secured in 1763 when Spain ceded Florida to Britain in an exchange of territory under the Treaty of Paris ending the Seven Years' War.\n\nWormsloe Plantation in Savannah, Georgia annually commemorates the War of Jenkins' Ear.\n\n\n"}

He was a slave trader, planter, Whig politician, and attorney in Natchez, Mississippi. Receiving news of the Texas Revolution, he raised and equipped troops (often at his own expense) and money throughout Mississippi and Kentucky.\n\nHe left Natchez on May 5, 1836, with 500 to 700 volunteers to join the Texian army, but arrived well after the Battle of San Jacinto in which Mexican President General Santa Anna ceded defeat and, in effect, granted Texas her independence.\n\nOn June 25, Texas President David G. Burnet appointed Major General Mirabeau B. Lamar as secretary of war, to succeed the resigning Thomas J. Rusk. Texas received word that Mexico had rejected the Treaty of Velasco and had sent General José de Urrea to attack Goliad, Rusk immediately rescinded his resignation. Huston and Thomas Jefferson Green teamed up to get the army to oppose Lamar, and Rusk resumed command. However, the Mexican attack failed to materialize, and Rusk retired. The Texan army picked Huston to replace him. Discontent continued and army officers openly defied the government and threatened to impose a military dictatorship.\n\nOn December 20, 1836, Sam Houston commissioned Huston as a brigadier general in the 2,000-man army and temporary commander-in-chief. His men referred to him as \"Old Long Shanks\" or \"Old Leather Breeches\", and Huston attracted adventurers and men of little discipline to his \"Camp Independence\" in Jackson County. He feared San Antonio could not be defended in the event of another Mexican invasion, and ordered the town and the nearby Alamo to be burned.\n\nHowever, Juan Seguín intervened, and the town and historic mission were spared from destruction. Later in the year, Sam Houston appointed Albert Sidney Johnston as the senior brigadier general and permanent commander of the Texan army. Huston felt slighted, and challenged Johnston to a duel on February 5, 1837, wounding him in the right hip.\n\nIn November 1839, Huston was elected as major general of the militia, defeating James C. Neill and other candidates. He developed an aggressive scheme to capture Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in 1840, believing that Texas should expand its borders southward beyond the Rio Grande. However, his desires were thwarted by moderates.\nIn August, war chief Little Buffalo Hump and 500 Comanche Indians attacked Victoria, Texas, and other nearby towns, stealing horses and livestock and killing dozens of white settlers. Huston led 200 Texans and Chief Placido and his Tonkawa scouts against the raiders at Plum Creek near Lockhart on the evening of August 11, killing 80 Comanches while only losing one man.\n\nIn May 1837, President Sam Houston furloughed much of the Texas army, leaving Huston a general without troops to command. Shortly after the Battle of Plum Creek, Huston left Texas and co-founded a law firm in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1844, he supported a movement to annex the republic to the United States. However, by the late 1850s, Huston had become an ardent secessionist. In 1851, he spoke at a rally in New Orleans supporting Cuban independence from Spain.\n\nIn 1857, he died in Natchez, Mississippi.\n\n"}

Ngeze was a founding member and leadership figure in the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), a Rwandan Hutu Power political party that is known for helping to incite the genocide.\n\nNgeze is best known for publishing the \"Hutu Ten Commandments\" in the December edition of \"Kangura\" in 1990, which were essential in creating and spreading the anti-Tutsi feeling among Rwandan Hutus that led to the Rwandan genocide.\n\nNgeze was born in Rubavu commune, Gisenyi prefecture, in Rwanda. He is a Muslim, of Hutu ethnicity. In addition to working as a journalist in 1978, Ngeze allegedly also earned money as a bus driver.\n\nNgeze was the Editor-in-Chief of the bimonthly \"Kangura\" magazine, which was initially intended as a counterweight to the popular anti-government newspaper \"Kanguka\", and was financed by high-level members in the ruling MRND party of Hutu dictator Juvénal Habyarimana. Ngeze and his magazine had extensive links to the Akazu, the network of officials surrounding the President and his wife; this group included supporters of Hutu Power and the architects of the Rwandan genocide.\n\nIn December 1990, Ngeze published the \"Hutu Ten Commandments\" (sometimes called the \"Ten Commandments of the Bahutu\") in \"Kangura\", which made disparaging remarks about Tutsis in general and Tutsi women in particular. With the \"Hutu Ten Commandments\", Ngeze revived, revised, and reconciled the Hamitic myth (Tutsis were considered by the Europeans to be a \"Hamitic race\" superior to the \"Negroid\" populations of Sub-Saharan Africa based on their having more Caucasoid facial features; that is, the idea that the Tutsis were foreign invaders and thus should not be part of the Hutu-majority country) and the rhetoric of the Hutu revolution to promote a doctrine of militant Hutu purity. The \"Hutu Ten Commandments\" were essential in creating and spreading the anti-Tutsi feeling among Rwandan Hutus that led to the Rwandan genocide.\n\nIn 1993, Ngeze became a shareholder and correspondent for the newly founded Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), which was largely a radio equivalent of \"Kangura\". He was interviewed approximately eight times on RTLM.\n\nDuring the Rwandan genocide, Ngeze provided RTLM with names of people to be killed in his prefecture, which were broadcast on air. He was interviewed by RTLM and Radio Rwanda several times between April and June 1994, and in these broadcasts called for the extermination of the Tutsis and Hutus in opposition to the government.\n\nAt the same time, \"Kangura\" published lists of people to be eliminated by the military and the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militias during the genocide.\n\nNgeze is alleged to have personally supervised and taken part in torture, mass rape, and killings in his native Gisenyi Prefecture.

The band started in 2001 as a trio, composed of Marco Visconti, Marko Resurreccion, and singer Paul Toohill.\n\nThe group self-released an album, \"Forgive\" on MP3.com. When they signed to the Polish label Black Flames Records, their album was released as \"Forgive[n]\" in May 2004. An EP of new material, \"RE_Productions\", was released five months later. In 2005, the band released their second album, \"Hrs:Min:Sec\", on the German label Infacted Recordings.\n\nToohill left the band in 2007, to work on his solo project, Generator. He is also the main singer for a Nitzer Ebb tribute band called \"Muscle And Hate\".\n\nTheir third album, \"The Art of Revenge\", was released in January 2008 on Infacted. It was also licensed to Sigsaly Transmissions for North America and Gravitator Records for Russia the same year. A music video, the band's first, was produced for the album's title track.\n\nOver the years, the band played all over Europe, from their native Italy to Russia, as well as performing at festivals like Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Germany. In 2008, XP8 also reached US shores for the first time with their live show, supporting System Syn on a one-month promotional tour.\n\nThe following year they played at the Kinetik Festival in Canada, and begun working on their fourth studio album \"Drop The Mask\", which was released in early 2010 once again by Infacted Recordings, with the digital-only \"Want It\" coming up just a few months before.\nStraying away from a pure dancefloor sound, the band experimented also with different approaches to electronica, and the album immediately received good praises by the press, consecrating it as the most mature XP8 release to date.\nSoon afterwards the album was licensed to Metropolis Records for a North American released and peaked at number 1 on the label's mailorder a week before its street date, while a limited digipack edition with a bonus CD was released in Japan by Deathwatch Asia.\n\nXP8 is also well known for their remixes, having reworked tracks of several other bands, including Steve Aoki, Attrition, Mortiis, and Icon of Coil, and countless others.\n\nIn 2013, XP8 released the crowd-funded concept album \"Adrenochrome\", which they described as their best effort to date, without any record label support.\nEverything came to a grinding halt in 2014 when the band decided to disband, quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run for almost two decades but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that \"“[...] no one wants to be the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn’t want to get the fuck out of MY clubs a decade ago, and the last thing I wanted to become was one of them.”\" - clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again.\n\nBefore disbanding, XP8 released a series of 3 EPs over a period of 9 months, each released tied to one of the phases of the Alchemical process: the three releases went on to be praised as the band's best material by critics and fans alike, proving how the Italian duo left a mark on the industrial scene for years and years to come. Steven Gullotta at Brutal Resonance stated that \"\"XP8 may be dead, but their music will forever hold a place within my soul\"\", giving the band a good send off.\n\n\n\n"}
