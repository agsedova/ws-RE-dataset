It was founded in 2002 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by former WWE writer Court Bauer before the promotion moved their bases to New York City and later to Orlando, Florida. The promotion ran several live events and tapings for a television show named \"Underground TV\" which aired on the Sunshine Network. Founder Court Bauer described MLW's product as \"the most violent, hard-hitting action mixed with cutting edge storylines\", also described as \"Hybrid Wrestling\" a mix of wrestling styles; however, MLW closed in 2004 due to shortage of money after a few sponsorship exits.\n\nBauer resumed promoting events in July 2017, with a new weekly television show named \"MLW Fusion\" premiering on BeIN Sports in April 2018. Around the same time, MLW started a working relationship with Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide. In April 2019, MLW moved its operations into a corporate office building in New Rochelle, New York.\n\nFollowing the closures and acquisitions of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as the WWE) in 2001, Major League Wrestling (MLW) was founded on June 16, 2002; shortly after, the promotion took three months of hiatus to move their headquarters from Philadelphia to New York. MLW styled itself as an alternative to sports entertainment, with founder Court Bauer describing MLW's product as \"the most violent, hard-hitting action mixed with cutting edge storylines\", following in the tradition of ECW.\n\nIn 2003, MLW moved their base of operations to Florida and negotiated a deal with the Sunshine Network to air their television series \"Underground TV\", which ran between April 7, 2003 and February 14, 2004. These shows were hosted by Joey Styles and consisted of pre-taped matches from prior events. During this time, MLW promoted many former ECW wrestlers such as Sabu, Terry Funk, Shane Douglas, and Steve Corino, leading some fans to criticize the promotion as a mere imitation of ECW and that company's other prominent successor Ring of Honor. MLW ceased operations in March 2004.\n\nIn 2017, MLW announced it would once again be promoting wrestling events, the first one was named \"One-Shot\" with tickets going on sale July 21, 2017. In the same year, MLW announced it would run more shows in Orlando in 2018. Given the success of their independent outings, MLW was able to secure a television deal with beIN Sports for a new program, \"MLW Fusion\", which debuted on April 20, 2018. Their first episode featured Pentagon Jr. against Fenix as the main event.\n\nIn July 2018, MLW continued its expansion by presenting their first two-hour special on beIN Sports, \"Battle Riot\". Their first Battle Riot was won by Tom Lawlor, who would go to cash it in to win the MLW World Heavyweight Championship. Additionally, Major League Wrestling began introducing contracts as part of their growth strategy. In August, MLW started a working agreement with Mexican-based promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA). On September 19, it was announced that MLW signed another deal with beIN Sports to air \"MLW Fusion\" in Spanish.\n\nOn October 13, MLW announced their second two-hour special on beIN Sports, \"Halloween Special\". On October 18, it was announced the signings of PCO and Richard Holliday as full-time members of the promotion. It was also reported that Court Bauer and several MLW executives would travel to Monaco for Sportel, with intensions of making a big push internationally. Also announced was a project between MLW and Spiff TV.\n\nOn November 8, MLW held a \"Fusion\" television taping, named \"Fightland\", in Chicago at Cicero Stadium. Owner Court Bauer claimed that this was the highest attendance in MLW history, shattering the previous attendance record of 1,536 people for the June 20, 2003 event \"Hybrid Hell\" in Florida. On November 29, Bauer announced that \"Fusion\" would be broadcast live on beIN Sports on December 14, an announcement which had previously been teased on November 22. This coincided with their two-day television tapings in Miami: \"Never Say Never\" and \"Zero Hour\". The live episode was an hour of \"Zero Hour\"'s events.\n\nMLW held live specials on BeIN Sports for their first two events of 2019, \"SuperFight\" in February and \"Intimidation Games\" in March. The company brought former manager Jim Cornette on as a color commentator starting March 2, 2019. He continued to work for the company for \"Rise of the Renegades\", \"Battle Riot II\", and \"Fury Road 2019\". He also worked unofficially in an agent-like role for the company. This includes coaching younger talent on their television presentation and promos.\n\nIn the beginning of 2019, their first four events, \"SuperFight\", \"Intimidation Games\", \"Rise of the Renegades\" and \"Battle Riot II\" were all revealed to have sold out. In April 2019, they moved their operations into a corporate office building in New Rochelle, New York. On April 18, 2019, MLW announced the creation of a new title: the MLW National Openweight Championship, with the inaugural champion to be crowned during the promotion's \"Fury Road 2019\" show in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Tony Schiavone returned to commentary in July 2019. On July 5, it was announced that MLW would hold its first pay-per-view event named Saturday Night SuperFight, which would be held on November 2. On July 26, MLW announced a working agreement with Japanese-based promotion Pro Wrestling Noah, which would include a talent-exchange agreement and content collaboration between the two promotions. On August 8, MLW announced that they had reached a deal with FITE TV to produce content for their streaming network, with the first MLW event produced for FITE TV being Saturday Night SuperFight on November 2. Four days later, MLW announced a working relationship with Mexican-based promotion The Crash Lucha Libre termed as a \"strategic alliance\". On August 23, MLW and The Crash announced they would co-promote their first event on October 5 at the Auditorio Fausto Gutierrez in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nOn February 1, 2020, MLW announced a working relationship with Japanese promotion Dragon Gate (DG), which would include a talent-exchange between the two promotions.\n\nIn the beginning, MLW would hold one show a month, originally from the Viking Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the end of 2002, MLW began running two shows a month and, in 2003, multiple shows in a weekend were held in New York. The first time MLW left New York was December 20, 2002, for \"King Of Kings\" from the War Memorial Auditorium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The promotion primarily held events in Florida prior to closing its doors in 2004.\n\nSince their return in 2017, MLW was running shows back in Florida, but also returned to New York in 2018 as a result of their successful deal with BeIN Sports. MLW's touring pattern changed drastically. Instead of running regular shows in cities where the company had a following, MLW began focusing more on cities that carry its television show. On September 18, MLW announced their debut in Chicago. On October 19, MLW announced that they would return to Florida to make their Miami debut.\n\nMLW returned with a changed business model in 2011, initially focusing exclusively on producing broadcast and digital content within the professional wrestling category. MLW Radio Network has grown to consistently have 5-6 podcasts in the top iTunes 100 in the sports category on the average day. Many prominent professional wrestling figures have appeared on the network, including former WWE and WCW wrestlers Kevin Sullivan, Jim Duggan and MVP, current WWE executive Bruce Prichard, former WCW commentator Tony Schiavone and former WCW President / current WWE executive Eric Bischoff.\n\nIn 2018, after the promotion was revived, MLW signed some talent to exclusive contracts. It also gave MLW power over the performers' dates. Their wrestlers are allowed to perform for other promotions but have to prioritize MLW events. As a result, MLW's roster mainly consists of independent contractors who also appear in other promotions (Namely Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide and Impact Wrestling).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2030045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030045", "title": "Specific energy", "text": "Specific energy\n\nSpecific energy or massic energy is energy per unit mass. It is also sometimes called gravimetric energy density, or just though energy density more precisely means energy per unit volume. It is used to quantify, for example, stored heat and other thermodynamic properties of substances such as specific internal energy, specific enthalpy, specific Gibbs free energy, and specific Helmholtz free energy. It may also be used for the kinetic energy or potential energy of a body. Specific energy is an intensive property, whereas energy and mass are extensive properties.\n\nThe SI unit for specific energy is the joule per kilogram (J/kg). Other units still in use in some contexts are the kilocalorie per gram (Cal/g or kcal/g), mostly in food-related topics, watt hours per kilogram in the field of batteries, and the Imperial unit BTU per pound (Btu/lb), in some engineering and applied technical fields.\n\nThe concept of specific energy is related to but distinct from the chemical notion of \"molar\" energy, that is energy per mole of a substance, which uses units of energy per mole, such as J/mol, kJ/mol, or the older (but still widely used) kcal/mol.\n\nThe following table shows the factors for conversion to J/kg of some non-SI units. :\nFor a table giving the specific energy of many different fuels as well as batteries, see the article Energy density.\n\nFor ionising radiation, the gray is the SI unit of specific energy absorbed by matter known as absorbed dose, from which the SI unit the sievert is calculated for the stochastic health effect on tissues, known as dose equivalent. The International Committee for Weights and Measures states: \"In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose \"D\" and the dose equivalent \"H\", the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose \"D\" and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent \"H\".\"\n\nEnergy density is the amount of energy per mass or volume of food. The energy density of a food can be determined from the label by dividing the energy per serving (usually in kilojoules or food calories) by the serving size (usually in grams, milliliters or fluid ounces). Energy density is thus expressed in cal/g, kcal/g, J/g, kJ/g, cal/mL, kcal/mL, J/mL, or kJ/mL. The \"calorie\" commonly used in nutritional contexts is the kilocalorie (abbreviated \"Cal\" and sometimes called the \"dietary calorie\", \"food calorie\" or \"Calorie\" with a capital \"C\"). This is equivalent to a thousand calories (abbreviated \"cal\") or one kilocalorie (kcal). Because food energy is commonly measured in Calories, the energy density of food is commonly called \"caloric density\".\n\nEnergy density measures the energy released when the food is metabolized by a healthy organism when it ingests the food (see food energy for calculation) and the food is metabolized with oxygen, into waste products such as carbon dioxide and water. Besides alcohol the only sources of food energy are carbohydrates, fats and proteins, which make up ninety percent of the dry weight of food. Therefore, water content is the most important factor in energy density. Carbohydrates provide four calories per gram (17 kJ/g), and proteins offer slightly less at 16kJ/g whereas fat provides nine calories per gram (38 kJ/g), times as much energy. Fats contain more carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds than carbohydrates or proteins and are therefore richer in energy. Foods that derive most of their energy from fat have a much higher energy density than those that derive most of their energy from carbohydrates or proteins, even if the water content is the same. Nutrients with a lower absorption, such as fiber or sugar alcohols, lower the energy density of foods as well. A moderate energy density would be 1.6 to 3 calories per gram (7–13 kJ/g); salmon, lean meat, and bread would fall in this category. High-energy foods would have more than three calories per gram and include crackers, cheese, dark chocolate, and peanuts.\n\nEnergy density is sometimes useful for comparing fuels. For example, liquid hydrogen fuel has a higher specific energy (energy per unit mass) than gasoline does, but a much lower volumetric energy density.\n\nSpecific mechanical energy, rather than simply energy, is often used in astrodynamics, because gravity changes the kinetic and potential specific energies of a vehicle in ways that are independent of the mass of the vehicle, consistent with the conservation of energy in a Newtonian gravitational system.\n\nThe specific energy of an object such as a meteoroid falling on the earth from outside the earth's gravitational well is at least one half the square of the escape velocity of 11.2 km/s. This comes to 63 MJ/kg (15 kcal/g, or 15 tonnes TNT equivalent per tonne). Comets have even more energy, typically moving with respect to the sun, when in our vicinity, at about the square root of two times the speed of the earth. This comes to 42 km/s, or a specific energy of 882 MJ/kg. The speed relative to the earth may be more or less, depending on direction. Since the speed of the earth around the sun is about 30 km/s, a comet's speed relative to the earth can range from 12 to 72 km/s, the latter corresponding to 2592 MJ/kg. If a comet with this speed fell to the earth it would gain another 63 MJ/kg, yielding a total of 2655 MJ/kg with a speed of 72.9 km/s. Since the equator is moving at about 0.5 km/s, the impact speed has an upper limit of 73.4 km/s, giving an upper limit for the specific energy of a comet hitting the earth of about 2690 MJ/kg.\n\nIf the Hale-Bopp comet (50 km in diameter) had hit the earth, it would have vaporized the oceans and sterilized the surface of the earth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2030047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030047", "title": "A&amp;P (short story)", "text": "A&amp;P (short story)\n\n\"A&P\" is a short story written by John Updike in 1961. M. Gilbert Porter called the titular A & P in Updike's story \"the common denominator of middle-class suburbia, an appropriate symbol for [the] mass ethic of a consumer-conditioned society.\" According to Porter, when the main character chooses to rebel against the A & P he also rebels against this consumer-conditioned society, and in so doing he \"has chosen to live honestly and meaningfully.\" William Peden, on the other hand, called the story \"deftly narrated nonsense... which contains nothing more significant than a checking clerk's interest in three girls in bathing suits.\"\n\n\"A & P\", first introduced in \"The New Yorker\" on July 22, 1961, also later appeared in the collection \"Pigeon Feathers\".\n\nSammy, a teenage clerk in an A & P grocery, is working the cash register on a hot summer day when three young women about his age enter barefoot and clad only in swimsuits, to purchase herring snacks.\n\nAlthough they are dressed for the beach, Sammy allows the girls to continue shopping while he appraises them sexually. He imagines details about the girls based on their appearance alone, impressions that, to his surprise, are shaken when the leader of the trio, a gorgeous, classy-looking beauty he has dubbed \"Queenie\", speaks in a voice unlike that which he had created in his mind. Lengel, the old and prudish manager, feels the girls are not clothed appropriately for a grocery store, and admonishes them, telling them they must have their shoulders covered next time, which Sammy believes embarrasses them.\n\nOffended by the manager's disregard for the three customers' dignity, Sammy ceremoniously removes his store apron and bow tie and resigns on the spot, despite the mention by the manager of the pain this would cause his parents. Sammy then leaves the store, seemingly in expectation of some display of affection or appreciation from the young women involved, only to find that they've already left, apparently oblivious to his presence.\n\nManager of the local A & P, Lengel is a man who spends most of his days behind the door marked \"Manager\". Entering the story near the end, he represents the system: management, policy, decency, and the way things are. But he is not a one-dimensional character. He has known Sammy's parents for a long time, and he tells Sammy that he should, at least for his parents' sake, not quit his job in such a dramatic, knee-jerk way. He seems truly concerned even while he feels the need to enforce store policy.\n\n\"Queenie\" is the name Sammy gives to the gorgeous girl who leads her two friends through the grocery store in their bathing suits. He has never seen her before but immediately becomes infatuated with her. He comments on her regal and tantalizing appearance. She is objectified by 19-year-old Sammy, who notes the shapely contours of her figure and the seductiveness of the straps that have slipped off her shoulders. He also, however, clearly admires how her inappropriate attire defies convention. When Lengel chastises the girls for their attire, Queenie, whom Sammy imagines lives in an upper-middle-class world of backyard swimming pools and fancy appetizers, becomes \"sore now that she remembers her place, a place from which the crowd that runs the A & P must look pretty crummy.\" Sammy becomes indignant at Lengel's treatment of the girls and tries to help them save face by quitting his job. But Queenie appears not to notice and leaves the store promptly, diminishing the impact of Sammy's impulsive gesture.\n\nThese are the nicknames Sammy gives Queenie's friends, who are somewhat uneasier about their attire. Plaid is a plump, pretty girl in a plaid two-piece bathing suit; Big Tall Goony Goony is cynically observed by Sammy to have the sort of striking features other girls pretend to admire because they know she's no real competition to them (although he concedes that she's not bad-looking on the whole).\n\nReaders don't learn Sammy's name until the end of the story, even though he is the first-person narrator of the story. He is a checkout clerk at an A & P supermarket. His language indicates that, at age 19, he is both cynical and romantic. He notes, for instance, that there are \"about twenty-seven old freeloaders\" working on a sewer main up the street, and he wonders what the \"bum\" in \"baggy gray pants\" could possibly do with \"four giant cans of pineapple juice\". Yet when Queenie approaches him at the checkout, Sammy notes that \"with a prim look she lifts a folded dollar bill out of the hollow at the center of her nubbled pink top. ... Really, I thought that was so cute.\" He vacillates back and forth between these extremes of opinion during the story, calling some of his customers \"houseslaves in pin curlers\", yet he is sensitive enough that when Lengel makes Queenie blush, he feels \"scrunchy inside\". At the end of the story, he quits his job in an effort to be a hero to the girls and as a way of rebelling against a strict society. In a sudden moment of insight—an epiphany—he realizes \"how hard the world was going to be to [him] hereafter\" if he refuses to follow conventional paths.\n\nStokesie is a 22-year-old white man who is married with two children. He works with Sammy at the A & P checkout, and is the only other store checker mentioned. He is a minor character in the story but does show a sign of ritualism; Stokesie often jokes with Sammy that he will not get promoted unless there is a Soviet takeover of the United States within 20 years, but does his job faithfully each day, providing for his wife and kids. Like Sammy, he also observes the girls in the store with interest. He is a glimpse of what Sammy's future might be like; Stokesie's family \"is the only difference\" between them, Sammy comments.\n\nIn 1996, a short film directed by Bruce Schwartz was made based on the short story. It starred Sean Hayes as Sammy and Amy Smart as Queenie in their first official movie roles.\n\n\n"}

(1945–1969)\n\nManchester United Football Club is an English professional football club, based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, that plays in the Premier League. Founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, and changed its name to Manchester United in 1902.\n\nUnited had been league champions in 1908 and 1911, as well as winning the FA Cup in 1909, but the interwar years were less successful as financial problems blighted the club, who spent the 1920s, and 1930s bouncing between the First and Second Divisions. The club's Old Trafford stadium was then severely damaged in a German air raid in March 1941, and the club did not return there until the stadium's rebuilding was completed in 1949, until which time their home games were played at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City.\n\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions. Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948 - the club's first major trophy for 37 years. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.\n\nWith an average age of 22, the media labelled the back-to-back title winning side of 1956 and 1957 \"the Busby Babes\", a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players who had gradually replaced the older players of the team which had enjoyed success in the late 1940s, and early 1950s. In 1956–57, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from the Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season. En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.\n\nThe following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – and injured several more. Two other players were injured to such an extent that they never played again.\n\nReserve team manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup Final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958–59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified. In the two years that followed the tragedy, Busby built a new team around Munich survivors like Bobby Charlton, Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes by making signings including Albert Quixall, Noel Cantwell and Maurice Setters.\n\nBusby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963, which was the club's first major trophy since the Munich tragedy. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final, with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best. Matt Busby resigned as manager in 1969 and was replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.\n\nIn February 1945, with the Second World War in its final few months, Matt Busby met club president James Gibson in Manchester, where he was offered a three-year contract to become manager of Manchester United. At Busby's insistence, this was lengthened to five years; he was appointed manager aged only 36, having just finished his playing career which had seen him turn out for Manchester City and Liverpool as well as the Scottish national side. Busby's appointment was notable for his insistence that he had the authority to appoint his own staff and overall control of all matters related to the playing of the game, responsibilities usually held by club directors or chairmen. Busby did not assume managerial command until October 1945, after the start of the season, and his first act was to appoint Jimmy Murphy as Reserve Team coach.\n\nLeague football resumed for the 1946–47 season and United finished second with a side featuring the likes of Jack Rowley, Charlie Mitten and John Aston. The club captain was now Johnny Carey, an Irishman whose normal position was right-back but who during his United career playing in every position except on the right wing.\n\nThey would repeat this twice, and though disappointed by this failure, they did deliver the FA Cup in 1948, beating Blackpool 4–2 to claim their first major trophy for 37 years. It was the first of many trophies to come. United's stadium Old Trafford had been largely destroyed by German bombs in the Second World War, so they played their home fixtures at Manchester City's ground Maine Road between 1945 and 1949, when they returned to a rebuilt Old Trafford.\n\nAfter a 41-year wait, league title success finally came in 1952, with United, led by Johnny Carey, demolishing second-placed Arsenal 6–1 on the final day of the season to finish four points ahead of Arsenal and Tottenham. However, the side captained by Johnny Carey was beginning to show its age and a new set of players had to be found. Busby had already made an important signing the previous year by paying Birmingham City £25,000 for winger Johnny Berry, and as long ago as 1949 had signed young goalkeeper Ray Wood from Darlington, while a young Roger Byrne had excelled on the left wing in the title run-in, but many other positions were in need of changes.\n\nDuring the Second World War association football was effectively frozen, and James Gibson set about establishing the Manchester United Junior Athletic Club in 1938 with the aim of developing the ability of some of the country's most talented young players; it became a \"hotbed of young talent that would sustain the club for years to come\". When Busby took over in 1945 he overhauled the team; seven players were transfer listed, several changed positions and signed Jimmy Delaney from Celtic. These changes resulted in the club finishing the 1946–47 season as runners up in the First Division, and in 1948 the club won the FA Cup, beating Blackpool 4–2 in the final. At the start of the following season, Busby began selling some of the older players and replacing them with players from the Youth and Reserve teams. The term the 'Busby Babes' was coined in November 1951, after 18-year-old Jackie Blanchflower and 22-year-old Roger Byrne made their debuts against Liverpool at Anfield; Tom Jackson of the \"Manchester Evening News\" described them in a match report as 'United's Babes'.\nThe 1952–53 season saw the retirement of Johnny Carey, yet it also saw the introduction of the Busby Babes as the Championship team began to lose steam. David Pegg, Dennis Viollet, Duncan Edwards, and Bill Foulkes, aged between 16 and 21, all made their first appearances in the 1952–53 season. Many of the players at this time were a tribute to the scouting skills of Chief Scout Joe Armstrong (assigned the duty of finding talent in the North of England), Bob Bishop (Belfast), Billy Behan (Dublin) and Bob Harper, underpinned by United's innovative youth policy under Matt Busby. United finished eighth in 1954 and fifth in 1955 before winning the league by an 11-point margin in 1955–56 with Tommy Taylor and Dennis Viollet leading the line for a side which had an average age of only 22. Only two players in the 1956 team, Roger Byrne and Johnny Berry, had collected medals in both the 1952 and 1956 title winning campaigns. Against the Football League's wishes, they became England's first representatives in the European Cup.\n\nOne of the stars of the team was Duncan Edwards, who set the record as the youngest player ever to be capped for England when he played against Scotland at the age of 17 and 8 months. The record stood for more than 40 years before being broken in 1998 by Michael Owen, who would play for United more than a decade later. His legendary status is demonstrated by the fact that he placed sixth in a 1999 poll of Manchester United fans, asking them to name the top 50 United players of all time - despite his playing career lasting just five years and up to the age of 21.\n\nThe Championship was defended successfully in 1957, with Tommy Taylor scoring 22 goals, Liam Whelan getting 26 and a young Bobby Charlton grabbing 10 goals. United reached the FA Cup Final that year, but played without their goalkeeper Ray Wood for much of the game, eventually losing 2–1 to Aston Villa.\n\nUnited's first European match was a 2–0 win away to the Belgian champions Anderlecht. The return leg was played at Maine Road as Old Trafford did not have any floodlights, and United won 10–0. This is still their record victory in a European match.\n\nUnited then knocked out Borussia Dortmund and Athletic Bilbao having come back from two goals behind against Bilbao, before losing to Real Madrid in the semi-final.\n\nOn 5 February 1958, United played Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia, in the second leg of the European Cup quarter finals. The match ended in a 3–3 draw, but as United had already won the home leg 2–1, they won the tie 5–4 on aggregate and reached the semi finals for the second year in succession.\nThe team's chartered plane, an Airspeed Ambassador owned by British European Airways, left Belgrade on 6 February and stopped at Munich to refuel. Takeoff had to be aborted twice because of boost surging, a common problem in the \"Elizabethan\". The problem was caused by the fuel mixture being too rich, which caused the engines to over-accelerate: this problem was exacerbated by the altitude of the Munich airport.\n\nThe pilots were able to control the surging on the third takeoff attempt, but as they reached the V1 \"decision speed\" (after which it is unsafe to abort takeoff), the airspeed suddenly dropped. The aircraft left the runway, crashed through a fence and into a house. The left wing and the tail were ripped off, while the starboard side of the fuselage hit a fuel tank and exploded. Officially, the cause of the accident was build-up of slush on the runway, which caused the aircraft to lose speed, preventing it from achieving takeoff.\n\nMark Jones, David Pegg, Roger Byrne (United's captain since 1953), Geoff Bent, Eddie Colman, Liam Whelan, and Tommy Taylor were killed outright, in addition to club secretary Walter Crickmer, and coaches Tom Curry and Bert Whalley. Duncan Edwards, Matt Busby, and Johnny Berry were critically injured; Edwards died fifteen days later. Berry and Jackie Blanchflower survived but never played again. Byrne, Taylor and Edwards were all regular members of the England team, with 70 caps and 21 goals between them, while Pegg, Whelan, Berry and Blanchflower had all received full international recognition for England, the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.\n\nA total of 23 people died as a result of their injuries; among them were four other passengers and two of the crew, as were eight sportswriters including former Manchester City and England goalkeeper Frank Swift. Among the survivors were goalkeeper Harry Gregg, who had only just joined the club from Doncaster Rovers, full-back Bill Foulkes and forward Bobby Charlton.\n\nJackie Blanchflower and Johnny Berry were injured to such an extent that their playing careers were over, and Kenny Morgans was never the same player he had been before the crash. Matt Busby himself was in hospital for two months recovering from multiple injuries. Initially his chances of surviving were thought to be no better than 50-50.\n\nWhile Busby recovered in hospital, his assistant Jimmy Murphy took temporary charge of team affairs (Murphy had not gone to Yugoslavia with the team, as he was managing the Welsh national side in a World Cup qualifier against Israel). United struggled in the League after Munich, winning only one of their last 14 matches and finishing in ninth place. However, they performed well in the FA Cup matches and made it to the final, but lost to Bolton 2–0. At the end of the season, UEFA offered The FA the opportunity to submit both United and the eventual champions Wolves for the 1958–59 European Cup, an unprecedented move, as a tribute to the victims, but the FA declined.\n\nA period of rebuilding followed with several significant signings, including Albert Quixall, Maurice Setters, Denis Law, Pat Crerand, and Noel Cantwell between 1958 and 1962. Although they were sound long-term investments, the arrival of fresh blood failed to give the club an immediate leg-up in the league. Munich survivors Harry Gregg, Bill Foulkes and Bobby Charlton were all with the club for many years afterwards, while Ray Wood, Albert Scanlon and Kenny Morgans had all been transferred by 1961 and Dennis Viollet was sold to Stoke City in 1962.\n\nThe team's form was inconsistent, but despite a poor 19th place in the 1962–63 season, United managed to beat Leicester City 3–1 at Wembley to win the FA Cup.\n\nAfter the crash, Busby's Babes seemed inappropriate so a new name was sought. English rugby club Salford had toured France in the 1930s wearing red shirts and became known as \"The Red Devils\". Busby liked the sound of it, thinking a devil was more intimidating to opponents than angelic babes - and also had to reflect the fact the side would now feature more experienced players. He declared Manchester United should also be known as \"The Red Devils\" and soon the club began incorporating the devil logo into match programmes and scarves. In 1970, the club badge was redesigned, but now with a devil in the centre holding a pitch-fork.\n\nSeptember 1963 saw the debut of 17-year-old forward George Best, completing the \"holy trinity\" of Charlton, Law and Best that would help United to their successes of the 1960s. In 1963–64 Law scored 46 goals in all competitions. United finished second that season, then won the League in 1964–65 by goal average over a newly promoted Leeds United, who would go on to be one of the dominant sides in English football over the next decade. That season saw United go on a run of 13 wins in 15 games from September–December 1964. The rebuilding was complete: Bobby Charlton and Bill Foulkes were the only Munich survivors in that team, although Harry Gregg was still on the club's payroll despite a serious shoulder injuries, not leaving until the 1966–67 season.\n\nThat season was significant in other ways, too, as England were hosting the 1966 World Cup and Old Trafford was among the stadia to be upgraded at the government's expense, with the North Stand being rebuilt into a cantilevered structure. United's players Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles played for England in the Final, beating West Germany 4–2. Winger John Connelly was also in England's World Cup squad but was not selected in the team for the final.\n\nUnited won another league title in 1966–67, going unbeaten in their last 20 games and making sure of top spot by winning 6–1 over West Ham, qualifying them for the European Cup the next season and laying the groundwork for the climactic triumph of that era. They were knocked out of the League Cup at the Second Round stage by Blackpool, who won the Bloomfield Road tie 5–1.\n\nThe run to the European Cup began easily enough, and the Reds cruised past the Maltese team Hibernians for a 4–0 win on aggregate. A tough, physical series against Sarajevo was next, followed by Górnik Zabrze from Poland. United won 2–1 on aggregate and then came the semi-final - two matches against the mighty Real Madrid. Real played a defensive game in the first leg at Old Trafford, stifling the attacking magic of the Reds. United managed a 1–0 victory, but it was a very small advantage to take into the Bernabéu.\n\nDenis Law was suffering from a knee injury, so Busby decided instead to call up the 36-year-old defender Bill Foulkes, who now played most of his games in the centre of defence rather that on the right. The game started badly for United as Real Madrid ran circles around them, leading 3–1 at half-time, 3–2 on aggregate. United came back strongly after the break and pounded the Real defence to no avail for half an hour until David Sadler levelled the aggregate score. Then Bill Foulkes played the hero as he buried a pass from George Best into the goal. It was the only goal he ever scored in European competition and the last of only nine he would score in nearly 700 appearances for the club.\n\nUnited were through to the final and faced Benfica at Wembley. In many ways it was an emotional day, Matt Busby's journey finally coming full circle after the tragically aborted promise of the Busby Babes a decade earlier. It was also a testament to Busby's skill in judging talent, as the club had only paid transfer fees for two of that day's players.\n\nBobby Charlton opened the scoring for United, then Jaime Graça equalised. Benfica piled on the pressure in the dying minutes and it took a brilliant save from Alex Stepney to deny Eusébio the winning goal. United managed to hold out until extra time, then George Best finally broke free of the stifling marking of the Benfica defence and scored. Benfica were reeling and Brian Kidd, celebrating his 19th birthday, scored a header. Bobby Charlton finished off Benfica with a high shot for a 4–1 victory and United became the first English team to win the European Cup.\n\nMatt Busby would later be knighted for his accomplishments, as well as being awarded the Freedom of Manchester.\n\nAs the European champions, Manchester United faced off against Estudiantes de La Plata, the South American champions, in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup. Estudiantes won the series after a 1–0 win in Buenos Aires's \"La Bombonera\" and a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford. This became the first, and so far only, time Manchester United failed to win a title contested at their home ground. In the European Cup, United lost to Milan in the semi finals, after a Law goal that clearly crossed the line was disallowed in the second leg at Old Trafford, leaving United 1–0 winners on the night but 1–2 losers on aggregate. The season ended with Busby moving on to become General Manager. He had announced his intention to resign as team manager on 14 January 1969, and trainer Wilf McGuinness agreed to take over control of the first team.\n\nBy May 1969, the United squad was rather aged. Foulkes, whose appearances were now limited and who would retire the following season, was now 37. Shay Brennan and Bobby Charlton were now in their early thirties and Denis Law was just months short of his 30th birthday, although the squad did include some impressive younger players including 20-year-old forward Brian Kidd and new signing Willie Morgan, an acquisition from Burnley just after the European Cup victory. Alex Stepney, 26, was now United's regular goalkeeper, having been signed from Chelsea three years earlier to replace Harry Gregg.\n\n\n"}

Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it was recorded in August 1978 at Super Bear Studios in Berre-les-Alpes (Alpes-Maritimes), France, and is the twelfth track on the album.\n\nMusically, the song builds on Mercury's piano playing, with John Deacon and Roger Taylor providing a bass guitar and drums backing track. The song also provides an example of Queen's trademark style of multitrack harmony vocals for the chorus lines.\n\nThe song also appears in the band's 1981 compilation album \"Greatest Hits\", and in June 2011, as part of Queen's 40th anniversary celebrations, an old take of the song containing more guitar parts was included on the bonus EP of the re-released and remastered \"Jazz\" album. Featuring in films, commercials, and television shows, the song has grown in popularity in the four decades since its release. Bobby Olivier of \"Billboard\" attributes its initial rebirth to its appearance in the 2004 cult classic zombie apocalypse film \"Shaun of the Dead\". In 2014, \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted it their third favourite song by Queen.\n\nThe single reached number 9 in the UK charts but only number 86 in the US; as the album was a top-10 hit, the song got some airplay on U.S. album-oriented rock stations despite its low chart ranking as a single. Despite this the song has grown in stature with time and has been popularised not only by consistent airplay, but by its use in advertisements, television programmes and films, and through cover versions. It has subsequently become one of Queen's most popular songs. The song was voted as the third best Queen song by readers of \"Rolling Stone\", who noted that \"time has also been very kind to it and it's widely seen now as one of the group's best works.\" The single also has reached Platinum status in the United Kingdom. In a March 2019 \"Billboard\" magazine article titled, “The Evolution of Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now': How a Minor Hit Became One of The Band's Most Beloved (And Inescapable) Songs”, Bobby Olivier writes,\n\nAlexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" wrote that the \"astonishing\" song \"may be Queen’s greatest song of all.\" He felt it was \"a direct product of [Mercury's] hedonism and promiscuity: an unrepentant, joyous, utterly irresistible paean to gay pleasure-seeking. You find yourself wondering if its title might not have been aimed at his censorious bandmates.\" Mike Orme of \"Stylus Magazine\" ranked it the 7th greatest penultimate track on an album, calling it Queen's \"most flamboyant and energetic single\" and commenting: \"Essentially three and a half minutes of Freddie Mercury jacking the mike from the rest of the world, the song offers him a chance to let us know just how much fun he’s having in the spotlight.\"\n\nDespite its popularity, Brian May was not a fan of the song as he felt it was celebrating the hedonistic and risky lifestyle of Mercury. He added that he struggled with the lyrics at the time, because it was about a difficult period in Freddie's life when the singer was \"taking lots of drugs and having sex with lots of men.\"\n\nThe video for the song was directed by J. Kliebenstein and filmed at the Forest National, Brussels, Belgium on 26 January 1979.\n\nViewed at the time of release as one of the lesser songs in the Queen canon, it was only performed live during 1979, with the last performance in the Crazy Tour. On the studio version, Brian May's only guitar playing is in his guitar solo, but on live versions performed on the band's 1979 Jazz and Crazy tours, May would also play rhythm guitar throughout the rest of the song to give more of a rock feel. A live version of the song features in the band's 1979 album \"Live Killers\".\n\n\nQueen:\n\nNotable cover versions include:\n"}
{"id": "2030080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030080", "title": "Henri Bertini", "text": "Henri Bertini\n\nHenri Jérôme Bertini (28 October 1798 – 30 September 1876) was a French classical composer and pianist. He was born into a family of musicians and attracted the attention of François-Joseph Fétis when he toured Europe as a child prodigy. As an adult he was admired both as a soloist and as a chamber musician; it was said that he played with Johann Nepomuk Hummel's simplicity and elegance without sacrificing the brilliance of the instrument. As a composer he had an original style which was rich in musical ideas, attractive melodies, and effortless harmonies. In 1848 he retired from the musical scene and settled in the Dauphiné in south-east France.\n\nHenri Jérôme Bertini was born in London on 28 October 1798 but his family returned to Paris six months later. He received his early musical education from his father and his brother, a pupil of Muzio Clementi. He was considered a child prodigy and at the age of 12 his father took him on a tour of England, Holland, Flanders, and Germany where he was enthusiastically received. After studies in composition in England and Scotland he was appointed professor of music in Brussels but returned to Paris in 1821. It is known that Bertini gave a concert with Franz Liszt in the Salons Pape on 20 April 1828. The program included a transcription by Bertini of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A major for eight hands (the other pianists were Sowinsky and Schunke.) He was also admired as a chamber music performer, giving concerts with his friends Antoine Fontaine (violin) and Auguste Franchomme (cello). He remained active in and around Paris until around 1848 when he retired from the musical scene. In 1859 he moved to Meylan (near Grenoble) where he died on 30 September 1876.\n\nBertini concertized widely but was not as celebrated a virtuoso as either Friedrich Kalkbrenner or Henri Herz. One of his contemporaries described his playing as having Clementi's evenness and clarity in rapid passages as well as the quality of sound, the manner of phrasing, and the ability to make the instrument sing characteristic of the school of Hummel and Moschelès. Thomas Tapper wrote:\nHe was in his time a shining example of the most admirable qualities of an artist. Living in an age of garish virtuosity, and hailed as a brilliant executant himself, he maintained nevertheless the most rigorous standards of musicianship in his playing, in his compositions, and in the music which he appeared before the public to interpret. This is the more remarkable when one considers that his manhood was reached during the luxuriant period of French romanticism and that the extravagances of the literary outburst were reflected in the musical movements of the time. Virtuosity was subjected to sore temptations and many succumbed. Bertini stood for the sounder qualities of the artist and gradually acquired an extended and remunerative prestige. His life was singularly devoid of incident and official distinction, but the legacy of pedagogic works which he has left to us and his honorable activity give it every right to be called a success.\nBertini was celebrated as a teacher. Antoine Marmontel, who devoted the second chapter of his work on celebrated pianists to Bertini, wrote\nHe was unsurpassed as a teacher, giving his lessons with scrupulous care and the keenest interest in his pupils' progress. After he had given up teaching, a number of his pupils continued with me, and I recognized the soundness of the principles drawn from his instruction.\n\nIt is above all in the special class of studies and caprices, that Bertini's immense popularity is founded. It is here that he occupied a unique position and opened the path over which the next generation of composers was to rush after him. In each of his numerous collections of studies, embracing every degree of difficulty, he has insistently given to every piece, easy or difficult, brief or extended, a character of salient melody. The technical problem to be overcome presents itself as a song; even where the study is devoted to the problem of velocity the general contour falls into a melodic curve, and this is the first and transcendent cause of the universal success of these pieces, which are, furthermore, natural in respect to rhythm and carefully thought out harmonically.\nRobert Schumann, in a review of one of Bertini's piano trios in the \"Gesammelte Schriften\", comments that Bertini writes easily flowing harmony but that the movements are too long. He continues: \"With the best will in the world, we find it difficult to be angry with Bertini, yet he drives us to distraction with his perfumed Parisian phrases; all his music is as smooth as silk and satin.\" German sentimentality has never appreciated French elegance.\n\nBertini is best remembered today for his piano method \"Le Rudiment du pianiste\", and his 20 books of approximately 500 studies.\n\nThe Nonetto opus 107 for flute, oboe, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, viola, cello, double bass, and piano, composed in 1835, is one of Bertini's major works. Berlioz wrote a review in Maurice Schlesinger's widely distributed and very influential \"La Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris\" of a performance at a music evening given by the Tilmant brothers on 6 May 1838:\nThat same evening a Nonetto by Bertini for piano, viola, cello, oboe, flute, horn, bassoon, trumpet and bass, was performed. It is a great and beautiful composition in which each instrument contributes to the whole according to its importance and idiomatic qualities, without trying to stand out individually. The piano itself is only entrusted those parts which contribute to the musical sense of the moment, and makes no effort toward brilliance for brilliance's sake. Beethoven himself followed this philosophy in his immortal trios. Amongst other movements, this Nonetto includes an adagio entitled La Melancolie which provides more than its title might indicate; it is so grandiose, at times so majestically sombre, that the sentiment of melancholy one expects is overshadowed by ideas of a much higher and rare order. In no way do I mean to quibble with the title, God forbid; all I wish to say is that this admirable work is not only melancholic, but also much more. In the Scherzo and Finale one finds details of graceful melancholy as well as vivacious charm, but the Adagio rises up in the centre of the work like the Mont Blanc among its neighbouring peaks; it dominates all; it is a sublime and profound meditation which provides an almost painful impression that cannot be forgotten.\nBerlioz later made further comments about this evening in the July 6 edition of \"Le Journal des débats\":\nThe Nonetto by Bertini... is the work of a great musician with a lively and ardent imagination, who will grow stronger and more powerful if he refrains from his attempts to encourage applause as he occasionally sought to do in the first movement. His peroration was all too obvious and he is seen to be too preoccupied with achieving success and producing effects. This detracts from the free flowing of his thoughts. This fault does not exist in the other parts of the Nonetto. In composing these the author, fully involved in his subject, undoubtedly forgot that he was actually writing for his public, and concerned himself only with the task at hand and the ultimate unity of the work. Which of these last three movements is our favourite? The Adagio, above all, is without question a noble and magnificent inspiration whose sombre poetry reminds us of the sublime greatness of Beethoven's Sonatas. This is admirable.\nThe Nonetto was reduced to a quintet (flute or violin, violin, viola, cello and piano) by Charles Schwencke, a pianist and composer from Hamburg who was living in Paris. This appears to have been done for amateur musicians: the flute part, which can be replaced by a violin, contains frequent octave transpositions to make it easier to play.\n\nBertini wrote approximately 500 études, ranging from easy studies for young students whose hands cannot span an octave to concert études. They were published in sets of 25 studies each. Roughly in order of difficulty they are:\n\n\n\nVocal Music\n\nLe jaloux dupé. Opéra comique en 1 acte\n\n\nStudies\n\nMiscellaneous piano pieces\n\nDuos for piano and violin by Bertini and Antoine Fontaine\n\nDuo for piano and violin by Bertini and Auguste Franchomme\n\nDuo for piano and flute by Bertini and Joseph Guillou\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2030085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030085", "title": "St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide", "text": "St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide\n\nSt Peter's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in the South Australian capital of Adelaide. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Adelaide and Metropolitan of the Province of South Australia. The cathedral, a significant Adelaide landmark, is situated on approximately of land at the corner of Pennington Terrace and King William Road in the suburb of North Adelaide.\n\nThe south front has similar features to the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the Church of St Jean-Baptiste de Belleville in Paris, including an ornate rose window above the main entrance which depicts stories of South Australia and the Bible.\n\nThe See of Adelaide was constituted in June 1847. As there was no cathedral, Trinity Church on North Terrace was denoted as the \"pro tempore\" cathedral church. Augustus Short, the first Bishop of Adelaide, held the first ordinations there on 29 June 1848 (St Peter's feast day). When Adelaide was surveyed by Colonel William Light over a decade before, land in Victoria Square had been set aside for public use. Bishop Short obtained a land grant in the square from Governor Robe in March 1848; the grant was registered on 23 April 1851. By late 1849 a subscription was bringing in funds for construction of a cathedral on the now cleared site. Around this time the legality of the land grant began to be publicly questioned. It was argued that the area was a public reserve and the governor had no power to issue such grants. To resolve matters Bishop Short, supported by the Synod, took the matter to the Supreme Court. The judgment in June 1855 confirmed that the grant was invalid and construction could not proceed.\n\nBishop Short purchased just over an acre of land, on Pennington Terrace in North Adelaide, on 8 August 1862. He reported in 1868 that the funds gathered were sufficient and announced to the diocese's synod of his decision to begin construction of a cathedral. Bishop Short had William Butterfield design the cathedral, but the long communication gap between England and Adelaide contributed to delays and disagreement. Butterfield's plans were purchased and given to Edward John Woods, of Adelaide architectural firm Wright, Woods and Hamilton, for completion. Woods changed some of the plans' materials and design, while keeping the general details as Butterfield had proposed. Woods was noted by his colleague Walter Bagot as strongly influenced by French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, and had imbued a French Gothic character in many elements of its design. Bishop Short laid the foundation stone, a block from Glen Ewin Quarry, on St Peter's Day 1869 in front of over a thousand people. Brown and Thompson contracted for the building work, which progressed slowly. The first service was held on St Peter's Day 1876, though the building was incomplete. Synod meetings and regular services began in May 1877.\n\nThe women of the diocese had raised £1,200 to purchase an organ which was installed in 1877. The first part of the cathedral was consecrated on 1 January 1878. By the time Bishop Short retired in late 1881, £18,000 received from many donors had been spent. Much of the furnishing was also donated including stained glass windows, a marble font, the chancel's tessellated pavement and an altar. Work began again in 1890 during the tenure of Bishop George Wyndham Kennion. Governor the Earl of Kintore laid a foundation stone, of Monarto South granite, on 27 September. The ceremony included Masonic Honors as the Governor was Grand Master of the South Australian Freemasons. The congregation raised funds and Woods was again contracted as architect. Over £10,000 was spent beginning the two towers and the western part of the nave, and completing the northern porch. Building work ceased in 1894 when funds were exhausted and did not resume for some years.\n\nA £4,000 bequest came from Sir Thomas Elder in 1897. This and other smaller amounts from offerings and gifts were added to the building fund. A tender was awarded in 1899 to complete the nave and bring the towers to roof height. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge donated £1,000, conditional on completion of work by 1902, and in 1900 Robert Barr Smith donated £10,000 to enable completion of the towers, spires and creation of an apse at the chancel end. The Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary) were present when the nave was consecrated and a Boer War memorial unveiled on 14 July 1901. A dedication ceremony for the towers and spires was held on 7 December 1902, and the last scaffolding removed two months later. The south porch and some temporary vestries were subsequently built, in addition to a crypt under the Lady chapel. A consecration ceremony was held on 7 April 1904; this marked completion of the cathedral's external structure. Records show that the work from the 1890s to date had cost somewhat over £25,000.\n\nThe cathedral's interior is long of which the Lady chapel occupies ? and the nave and chancel the remainder. The nave is wide and, at the top of the spire's crosses, the cathedral rises from ground level. Hammer dressed Tea Tree Gully sandstone—from what is now Anstey Hill Recreation Park— was used in the sanctuary, choir, transepts and part of the nave. Stone used for the quoins is lighter in colour and came from the same area as that used in the Adelaide Town Hall. The building's base and some of the interior uses stone from Glen Osmond in the Adelaide Hills. Other parts of the cathedral use stone from New Zealand, Pyrmont, New South Wales and Murray Bridge.\n\nA reredos—a decorative structure behind the altar—was installed in 1904. It was finished considerably later and dedicated on 6 March 1910 by Bishop Arthur Nutter Thomas. The reredos, containing 23 coloured and gilded panels plus carved figures, is high. This structure was built at St Sidwells Art Works, Tiverton, England to a design by T. H. Lyon. The reredos features Christ in the centre panel, with saints filling the surrounding niches. Four coloured panels below the figure of Christ depict events in the life of St Peter, the patron saint of the cathedral. The cathedral has significant fine-quality stained glass windows. James Powell and Sons made three that were unveiled in the Lady chapel in November 1900. The southern transept window is the largest stained glass window in the cathedral and was dedicated in August 1926. A window representing Saint Cecilia, patron saint of church music, was unveiled in 1876 in the pulpit side of the chancel, though by 1969 it was ironically concealed by the organ. Windows elsewhere were funded and influenced by bequests. Amongst these Charles Beaumont Howard's memory is commemorated by a window in the chancel, Sir Anthony Musgrave's daughter Joyce Harriet by one in the sacristy and churchman Richard Bowen Colley by another window in the chancel. The remains of the English biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher are interred within the cathedral.\n\nThe stalls for the canons and choir, along with the original bishop's throne (now used as the dean's stall) and pulpit canopy, were a gift to the cathedral from Sir John Langdon Bonython in memory of his wife. Made in Adelaide in 1926, carvings can be seen on the capitals at each end of the stalls and also around the upper work in the canopies above.\n\nIn the western tower is the cathedral's ring of eight bells, hung for change ringing. Their purchase was funded by a bequest from cathedral warden Frederick Allen Wakeman. They were cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough England in 1946 and were dedicated by Bishop Robin on 29 June 1947. With the tenor (largest) bell weighing just over they are the heaviest ring of eight bells in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second heaviest ring of eight in the world after Sherborne Abbey in England. The bells are rung by members of The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers who also operate the Adelaide Ringing Centre of 8 dumb-bells for training which opened in 2012.\n\nSt Peter's Cathedral has a long and distinguished musical reputation in Adelaide. St Peter's Cathedral Choir has been singing services in the cathedral for over 130 years. It is the only choir of children and adults of its type in Adelaide. Currently, the choir sings three choral services per week (Solemn Eucharist and Evensong every Sunday, plus Evensong on Wednesdays during school terms) in addition to regular concert performances and other special services. In 2006/7 and 2010/11, the choir toured internationally to the UK and Italy. In 2014/15, the choir undertook their third international tour to the UK and France.\n\nHistorically, the Master of the Choristers was also the Cathedral Organist. In 1994, role was split, creating the positions of Director of Music and Organist.\n\n\nThe cathedral's original organ was built by the London firm of Bishop & Son. It was installed in 1877 and dedicated on 1 January 1878. Located in what is now the sacristy, it was used for over fifty years before relocation in 1930 to St Augustine's Church in Unley, South Australia. The current organ was built by William Hill & Son and Norman & Beard of Melbourne and London and was dedicated on 29 July 1929. Until 2017, it remained largely unaltered, featuring electro-pneumatic action, four manuals and fifty speaking stops, featuring 26 couplers. Two additions were made, the addition of a Mixture V stop on the Great (1986) and the 32' Contra Trombone to the pedal division (1989). The lowest 12 pipes of this rank are located on a wall above the sacristy, opposite the main organ case. In 1963, a carved wooden case for the organ, designed by Walter Bagot, was only partly installed. In 2017/18, the instrument underwent major restoration and overhaul by Harrison & Harrison Ltd of Durham, UK. New mixtures were added to both the great and swell divisions, plus the addition of 8' and 4' principal stops in the pedal division. Some tonal irregularities dating from the 1980s were reversed, ensuring the instrument once again speaks and sounds to the original Hill, Norman and Beard specification. The console was also upgraded to include a capture system and modern playing aides, and the casework was completed, drawing inspiration from the original Bagot design. This work was completed at a cost of approx AU$1.5 million and the \"First Chords\" played on Advent Sunday 2 December 2018.\n\nThe bishop of Adelaide was the formal rector of the cathedral until 1986. The cathedral was governed by the bishop with assistance from a dean (the dean of Adelaide) and chapter. The dean and chapter operated as an independent body, meaning they were not required to report to the synod of the Diocese of Adelaide. In 1986, the administrative functions of the dean and chapter were transferred to the cathedral council. Since 1986, the cathedral has been administrated as a parish with the dean (known as the dean of the cathedral) as rector. The dean of the cathedral is not synonymous with the dean of Adelaide (which has been vacant since 1997).\n\n\n\n"}

He is the founder and former owner of the promotion Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW).\n\nCorson was born in Sewell, New Jersey. Before he was a professional wrestler, Corson was an explosives and demolition expert.\n\nCorson began training as a wrestler in 1994 and adopted the ring name John Zandig in 1999. Shortly after debuting, Zandig opened a professional wrestling school, in New Jersey in order to hone his skills. The school eventually evolved into a professional wrestling promotion, Combat Zone Wrestling, and relocated to Philadelphia in late 2001. From its early stages, CZW was oriented towards hardcore wrestling; Zandig himself has been involved in many ultraviolent matches since the company's inception, involving such objects as thumbtacks, fluorescent light tubes, barbed wire, and a weed wacker. On one occasion, he was hung from meat hooks.\n\nZandig wrestled in Japan as the leader of CZW to compete for Big Japan Pro Wrestling. In the early 2000s, Zandig appeared in a Japanese television commercial alongside the Japanese actress Ai Kato for a soft drink product named C1000 (by Takeda Food.Co), where he was knocked out by Ai's lariat. At Cage of Death 8, Zandig lost to Nick Gage in a four-way Cage of Death match that included Lobo and LuFisto. Due to a prematch stipulation, Zandig was forced to retire as a result of losing. On March 10, 2007, Zandig teamed with Toby Klein to face and defeat DJ Hyde and Mitch Ryder in a no rope barbed wire match. Zandig was filling in for Necro Butcher, who couldn't make it to the show. After the match, Zandig stated that his return was for one night only.\n\nZandig once again came out of retirement at Tournament of Death 6 to face the Necro Butcher in a no-rope barbwired match when Necro Butchers original opponent, Mitch Ryder, could not make the show due to travel issues. He came out of retirement for the third time at Cage of Death X, defeating Danny Havoc, Brain Damage, Drake Younger, Sami Callihan and Devon Moore in the 10,000 dollar Cage of Death match. That same night he inducted himself into the New Alhambra Hardcore Hall of Fame simply because he could book himself to do that.\n\nOn August 8, 2009, John Zandig held a CZW Hall of Fame induction for Jon Dahmer, Hardcore Nick Gage, and Wifebeater; and recognition plaques for Mike Pancoast, Shawn and Sabine Kernaghan, WHACKS, and Maven Bentley. After announcing the Hall of Fame and special recognition plaques, Zandig announced that he was stepping down from CZW due to financial reasons and being too injured and tired to assume the duties that come with being the owner. Zandig announced that he had sold CZW, not for the price he wanted, but due to the economy it was enough to get him to sell. The new owner announced was CZW wrestler, DJ Hyde. On October 25, 2009, Nick Gage defeated Zandig in his retirement match.\n\nOn May 8, 2010, Zandig once again returned to the ring at CZW's Fist Fight and defeated Brain Damage in a Tournament of Death 9 qualifying match. Following his victory, Zandig was attacked by MASADA, setting up their first round meeting in June 2010's Tournament of Death 9 which Zandig no-showed due to injury. Zandig participated in the last CZW event held at the ECW Arena when he fought new CZW owner D.J. Hyde on January 14, 2012. This was the follow up from a surprise run-in at COD 13 when he attacked Hyde during his match with Greg Excellent.\n\nHe returned to the ring once again on the 5th of June 2016 in another deathmatch tournament organised by him, called Tournament of Survival. He was not originally scheduled in the tournament and was to go one on one with Joey Janela, but when wrestler Scott SUmmers could not compete anymore, he took the helm and got to the finals (but dropped out) as well as defeating Janela, hitting another rooftop Mother F'n Bomb onto Janela through a burning plytube board with light tubes on top of a truck. The tournament was later won by Danny Havoc.\n\nZandig returned to CZW on June 11, 2016 for the annual Tournament of Death. During a non-tournament match between Josh Crane and current owner, DJ Hyde, Zandig returned to the ring alongside Ruckus and Robbie Mireno and beat down DJ Hyde until he would give up his ownership. However, DJ Hyde would not, so along with the help of Josh Crane, Zandig, Mireno and Ruckus buried DJ Hyde alive until he gave up ownership of CZW.\n\nHe appeared in the video game \"\", and made a cameo in the wrestling drama \"The Wrestler\".\n\n\n"}

There have also been instances where an actor has acquired a signature song by giving a popular vocal performance in a film. Signature songs can be the result of spontaneous public identification, or a marketing tool developed by the music industry to promote artists, sell their recordings, and develop a fan base.

{"id": "2030098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030098", "title": "Raise the Titanic!", "text": "Raise the Titanic!\n\nRaise the Titanic! is a 1976 adventure novel by Clive Cussler, published in the United States by the Viking Press. It tells the story of efforts to bring the remains of the ill-fated ocean liner RMS \"Titanic\" to the surface of the Atlantic Ocean in order to recover a stockpile of an exotic mineral that was being carried aboard.\n\n\"Raise the Titanic!\" was the third published book to feature the author's protagonist, Dirk Pitt. It was the first of Cussler's novels with a prologue set long before the main story, describing an incident with consequences resolved in the present day.\n\nThe book was adapted into a 1980 feature film, \"Raise the Titanic\", directed by Jerry Jameson. The film was produced by Lord Grade's ITC Entertainment. Although it starred respected and popular actors and boasted a big budget, the movie was a box office bomb and received little critical or popular praise and was also disliked by Cussler.\n\nIn 1987, Dr. Gene Seagram leads the top-secret Pentagon program Meta Section, which secretly attempts to leapfrog current technology by 20 to 30 years. One result: the Sicilian Project, which uses sound waves to stop incoming ballistic missiles. The immense power needs of the Sicilian Project can be met only by an extremely rare mineral called Byzanium. After satellite data pinpoints the most likely source of byzanium, Meta Section sends Sid Koplin to Novaya Zemlya, an island off the northern coast of the Soviet Union. There he discovers that the byzanium ore has already been mined. While making his way back to his hidden boat Koplin is shot and captured by a Soviet guard but is rescued by the story's protagonist, Dirk Pitt.\n\nUsing clues found by Koplin, Seagram determines that the byzanium — a chunk worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars in 1912 figures — was mined in the early part of the 20th century by a group of Coloradan miners, including Joshua Hayes Brewster. The group was originally hired by the French government, but persuaded by the U.S. government to steal the mineral for the United States. Brewster and his men engage in a running battle with French assassins as they crisscross Europe trying to get their stolen goods home. Only Brewster reaches Southampton alive, and he books passage on the maiden voyage of the great White Star Line ship \"Titanic\".\n\nRealizing that the only supply of byzanium sufficient to power the Sicilian Project now lies at the bottom of the North Atlantic, Dr. Seagram approaches Dirk Pitt and the National Underwater and Marine Agency and gives them the near impossible task of raising the \"Titanic\". Using data from drop tank experiments Pitt is able to narrow down the search area and begin searching with deep sea submersibles. After finding a presentation model cornet that they can link positively to a member of the \"Titanic\"'s band, Pitt and his colleagues know they are searching in the right place. After discovering that the \"Titanic\" is intact they set out on audacious plan to patch all of the holes and then raise the wreck using compressed air.\n\nMeanwhile the Central Intelligence Agency convinces the President of the United States to leak information on both the Sicilian Project and the \"Titanic\" mission to the Soviet Union in the hopes of setting a trap to capture one of the Soviets' best intelligence officers in the KGB. When Soviet leaders realize that the development of the Sicilian Project would throw off the balance of power in the world and leave their nuclear arsenal impotent, they do just as the CIA hopes and launch an operation to sabotage the mission and steal the byzanium for themselves.\n\nOnce the \"Titanic\" is secured for the trip to the United States, a massive hurricane strikes the salvage area, allowing the Soviets to covertly board the ship and take the crew hostage. Pitt, who was previously believed dead after being last seen on board a crashed helicopter, reemerges to expose the Soviet spies within the salvage crew. With the help of Navy SEALs who boarded from a hidden U.S. Navy submarine, the crew regain control of the \"Titanic\". The ship is eventually towed to New York Harbor and laid up in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. When the ship's vault is opened, all are shocked to discover the byzanium was never actually aboard the ship. This revelation, coupled with deep troubles with his marriage and the President's agreement to leaking word of the Sicilian Project to the Soviets, eventually cause Dr. Seagram to have a nervous breakdown from which he never recovers. It is eventually revealed that Joshua Hayes Brewster, fearful that he would not make it onto the ship with the mineral, buried the byzanium in the grave of Vernon Hall, the last of the group to fall to the French assassins, located in the tiny English village of Southby. The novel ends with a successful test of the Sicilian Project in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\nAn adaptation of the novel was serialized as the first story in the short-lived comic strip \"Best Sellers Showcase\". The adaptation ran from August 15 to October 9 in 1977. And depending on the newspaper, the Sunday color strip appeared in two versions. One version had a title box followed by two frames of story resulting in a three row episode. The other version did not have the title box nor the following two frames thereby resulting in a two row episode.\n\n\n"}

In his second season in the Superleague he played 27 games (two goals) as the latter club finished in sixth position, thus qualifying to the UEFA Cup.\n\nAfter two years, Morris joined fellow league side Panathinaikos FC. He made his UEFA Champions League debut on 1 October 2003 in a 1–1 group stage home draw against Rangers.

He has been described as \"Iran's preeminent political dissident\", and a \"wildly popular pro-democracy journalist\" who has crossed press censorship \"red lines\" regularly. A supporter of the Islamic revolution as a youth, he became disenchanted in the mid-1990s and served time in Tehran's Evin Prison from 2001 to 2006 after publishing a series of stories on the murder of dissident authors known as the Chain Murders of Iran. While in prison he issued a manifesto which established him as the first \"prominent dissident, believing Muslim and former revolutionary\" to call for a replacement of Iran's with \"a democracy\".\n\nHaving been named honorary citizen of many European cities and awarded distinctions for his writing and civil, Ganji has won several international awards for his work, including the World Association of Newspapers' Golden Pen of Freedom Award, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression's International Press Freedom Award, the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, the Cato Institute Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty and the John Humphrey Freedom Award.\n\nGanji grew up in a devout and impoverished family in Tehran. Active in the Islamist anti-Shah forces at a \"relatively early age\", he served in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps during the Iran–Iraq War. He holds a master's degree in communications.\n\nIn 1994–5 Ganji became disenchanted with the government. \"I saw a fascism and political tyranny emerging in Iran. Anyone who asked questions was branded 'anti-revolutionary' and 'against Iran'.\" Ganji quit the Guard to become an investigative journalist. Shortly thereafter he gained fame and ran afoul of the authorities by \"exposing the role of high officials in sanctioning the murder of liberal dissidents\".\n\nGanji has written extensively as a journalist in a series of reformist newspapers, many of which were shut down by the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Possibly Ganji's most famous work was a series of articles in Saeed Hajjarian's \"Sobh Emrouz\" daily about the 1998 murders of dissident authors known as the Chain Murders of Iran. Akbar Ganji referred to the perpetrators of the killings with code names such as \"Excellency Red Garmented\" and their \"Excellencies Gray\" and the \"Master Key\".\n\nIn December 2000, after his arrest (see below), Akbar Ganji announced the \"Master Key\" to the chain murders was former Intelligence Minister Hojjatoleslam Ali Fallahian. He \"also denounced by name some senior clerics, including Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi for having encouraged or issued fatwas, or religious orders for the assassinations\". Conservatives have attacked Ganji and denied his claim.\n\nCollections of his articles appeared in books, notably, \"The Dungeon of Ghosts\" and \"The Red Eminence And The Grey Eminences\" (\"Alijenob Sorkhpoosh va Alijenob-e Khakestari\" (2000)) focusing on the involvement of the former President of Iran, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and his Minister of Intelligence, Ali Fallahian, in the chain murders. \"The Red Eminence and the Grey Eminences\" has been described by the \"Washington Post\" newspaper in the US as \"the Iranian equivalent of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago\". The one volume of his writings to appear in English translation is \"The Road to Democracy in Iran\" (MIT Press, April 2008).\n\nGanji took part in a conference in Berlin held by the Heinrich Boell Foundation under the title \"Iran after the elections\" held in the wake of the Majlis elections of February 2000 which resulted in a huge victory by reformist candidates. The gathering was termed \"anti-Islamic\" and \"anti-revolutionary\" by Iranian state TV, IRIB, which broadcast part of the conference on 18 April 2000. Returning to Iran from the conference he was arrested on 22 April 2000, accused of having \"damaged national security.\" Found guilty, in January 2001 he was sentenced to ten years followed by five years internal exile, which meant he would be kept in a specific city other than Tehran and could not leave the country. On 15 May 2001 an appeal court reduced his 10-year sentence to six months and overturned his additional sentence of five years' internal exile. However, the Tehran prosecutor, challenged the appeal court decision and brought new charges against him in connection with newspaper articles he had written prior to April 2000, and his possession of photocopies of foreign newspapers. On 16 July 2001 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment on charges of \"collecting confidential information harmful to national security and spreading propaganda against the Islamic system\".\n\nLike other political prisoners before him, Ganji took to writing from his prison cell. His political manifestos and open letters were smuggled out of jail and published on the internet, – two letters \"to the free people of the world\":.\n\nIn his last year in prison Ganji went on a hunger strike for more than 80 days from 19 May 2005 until early August 2005 except for a 12-day period of leave he was granted on 30 May 2005 ahead of the ninth presidential elections on 17 June 2005. His hunger strike ended after 50 days when \"doctors warned he would sustain irreparable brain damage, and he relented.\" Many Iranians had not heard of the hunger strike due to press censorship and heavy security and information quarantine in Milad Hospital in Tehran. His hunger strike mobilized the international human rights community, \"including eight former Nobel Peace laureates. Thousands of intellectuals and human rights activists around the world spoke out on his behalf. It is generally believed that the global support generated for Ganji during this period spared his life.\"\n\nHe was represented by a group of lawyers, including Dr. Yousef Molaei, Abdolfattah Soltani (who was arrested and put in solitary confinement in 2005 on unknown charges), and the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Shirin Ebadi.\n\nIn his recent leave in June 2005, Ganji participated in interviews with several news agencies, criticizing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, and asking for his office to be put to public vote. This led to a ruling by Saeed Mortazavi, the general prosecutor of Tehran, to arrest him again because of \"illegal interviews\". He returned to prison voluntarily on 11 June 2005 and started another hunger strike.\n\nGanji was released from prison in poor health on 18 March 2006, after serving the full term of his six-year sentence, according to his family and various count-downs set up on many Iranian weblogs. At the same time, the deputy prosecutor of Tehran, Mahmoud Salarkia, claimed that 10 days remained from his sentence due to unaccounted days of absence, and that he had been granted a leave for the Persian New Year. The claim has apparently been dropped since.\n\nIn June 2006 Ganji left Iran. Since then he has been writing and giving talks in Europe and North America, speaking out for the movement for democracy in Iran, and against any U.S. military attack on his country.\n\nGanji's writings in prison were smuggled out and widely distributed, especially on the web. Most notably he wrote a \"Republican Manifesto\" in six chapters in March 2002, laying out the basis of his proposal for a fully-fledged democratic republic for Iran. In particular he argued that all elections in the Islamic Republic of Iran must be boycotted. He later wrote a second book of his Republican Manifesto in May 2005, ahead of the ninth Presidential elections in Iran, specifically arguing for a complete boycott of the presidential elections.\n\nIn April 2008, Ganji's first book in English appeared from Boston Review Books/MIT Press: \"The Road to Democracy in Iran\", with an introduction by Joshua Cohen and Abbas Milani.\n\nGanji opposed the United States 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation.\n\nIn 2006, Akbar Ganji started a tour to visit world leading philosophers, theorists, human rights activists. His goal has been said to be introducing Iranian intellectual movements and democratic circles to world leading thinkers. He met many famous figures as Richard Rorty, Noam Chomsky, Anthony Giddens, David Held and Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt.\n\nDespite repeated invitations he refused to meet with any member of the administration of US president George W. Bush, on the principle that the struggle for democracy in Iran must be waged from within the country, without foreign governmental support. to meet with White House officials, citing his belief that current US policies were not helping promote democracy in Iran. He was quoted as saying, \"You cannot bring democracy to a country by attacking it\". He also added that the war in Iraq was promoting Islamic fundamentalism and hurting movements towards democracy in the region.\n\nGanji declared that his role was as a dissident and journalist, rather than the official voice for a specific opposition party or faction within Iran, which he explained was one reason for his refusal to meet with US political leaders and officeholders.\n\nDuring his visit he criticized the Iraq War, asserting that rather than undermining the current Iranian regime it had instead bolstered its capacity to repress and terrorize its population.\nWe do not want the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, this is our problem. Any intervention by any foreign power would bring charges of conspiracy against us. ... What has happened in Iraq did not support our movement in any significant way.\n\nGanji has strongly supported the 2009 Iranian election protests. He staged a hunger strike outside of the United Nations headquarters in order to highlight the plight of Iranian political prisoners, and to bring international attention to the oppressive conditions felt within Iran.\n\n\n\n"}

Both volumes were illustrated by Harry Furniss.\n\nThe novel has two main plots: one set in the real world at the time the book was published (the Victorian era), the other in the fantasy world of Fairyland. While the latter plot is a fairy tale with many nonsense elements and poems, similar to Carroll's \"Alice\" books, the story set in Victorian Britain is a social novel, with its characters discussing various concepts and aspects of religion, society, philosophy and morality.\n\nTwo short pieces, \"Fairy Sylvie\" and \"Bruno's Revenge\", originally appeared in \"Aunt Judy's Magazine\" in 1867. Some years later, in 1873 or 1874, Carroll had the idea to use these as the core for a longer story. Much of the rest of the novel he compiled from notes of ideas and dialogue which he had collected over the years (and which he called \"\"litter\"ature\" in the introduction to the first volume).\n\nCarroll initially intended for the novel to be published in one volume. However, due to its length, it was divided into two volumes, published in 1889 and 1893.\n\nThe novel is not nearly as well known as the \"Alice\" books. It was very poorly received and did not have many reprintings; modern commentators note that it lacks much of Carroll's characteristic humour. The poem \"The Mad Gardener's Song\", widely reprinted elsewhere, is the best-known part of the book.\n\nThe introductory poem contains a double acrostic on the name \"Isa Bowman\", one of Carroll's child friends.\n\nThere are two strands to the plot: the conspiracy against the Warden of Outland, instigated by the Sub-Warden and Chancellor, and the love of a young doctor, Arthur, for Lady Muriel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For V6, the group is split into 20th Century and Coming Century, which consists of the three oldest members and three youngest members respectively. The band sold more than 13.5 million albums and singles.\n\nIn an interview on \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ\", the group stated that the \"V\" in V6 also stood for \"Versus\" (20th Century versus Coming Century) at first. However, then-president Johnny Kitagawa informed the group that the \"V\" had multiple meanings, such as \"Volleyball\", \"Vegetable\" (as Sakamoto's parents own a green grocers), \"Bicycle\" (\"V\" and \"B\" are indistinguishable in Japanese; Nagano's parents own a cycling store) and \"Veteran\".\n\nFrom 1997 to 2008, V6 hosted their own variety show and is hosting \"Viva Viva V6\" since 2001 on Fuji TV.

They also had a rare \"Handshake Session\" with hundreds of thousands of fans in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka.\n\nAs separate bands, both of them performed the opening song for the anime, \"Eyeshield 21\". Coming Century performed \"Breakthrough\", the first opening theme song and 20th Century performed \"Innocence\", the second opening theme song.

{"id": "2030193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030193", "title": "Welsh people", "text": "Welsh people\n\nThe Welsh () are a Celtic nation and ethnic group native to Wales. The term \"Welsh people\" applies to people from Wales () and people of Welsh ancestry perceiving themselves or being perceived as sharing a cultural heritage and shared ancestral origins. Wales is one of the four countries of the United Kingdom. The majority of people living in Wales are British citizens.\n\nThe Welsh language is taught in schools and protected in law. It remains the predominant language in parts of Wales, particularly in North Wales and parts of West Wales. English is the predominant language in South Wales and many Welsh people do not speak the language, although even in predominately English-speaking areas of Wales, many are fluent or semi-fluent in Welsh or, to varying degrees, capable of speaking or understanding Welsh at limited or conversational proficiency levels. Although the Welsh language and its ancestors have been spoken in what is now Wales since well before the Roman incursions into Britain, historian John Davies argues that the origin of the \"Welsh nation\" can be traced to the late 4th and early 5th centuries, following the end of Roman rule in Britain.\n\nIn 2016, an analysis of the geography of Welsh surnames commissioned by the Welsh Government found that 718,000 people (nearly 35% of the Welsh population) have a family name of Welsh origin, compared with 5.3% in the rest of the United Kingdom, 4.7% in New Zealand, 4.1% in Australia, and 3.8% in the United States, with an estimated 16.3 million people in the countries studied having at least partial Welsh ancestry. Over 300,000 Welsh people live in London.\n\nThe names \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" are modern descendants of the Anglo-Saxon word \"wealh\", a descendant of the Proto-Germanic word \"Walhaz\", which was derived from the name of the Gaulish people known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire. The Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular. As the Britons' territories shrank, the term came ultimately to be applied to a smaller group of people, and the plural form of Wealh, , evolved into the name for the territory that best maintained cultural continuity with pre-Anglo-Saxon Britain: Wales. The modern names for various Romance-speaking people in Continental Europe (e.g. Wallonia, Wallachia, , Vlachs, and , the Polish name for Italy) have a similar etymology. \n\nThe modern Welsh name for themselves (plural) is \"Cymry\" (singular: \"Cymro\" [m] and \"Cymraes\" [f]), and \"Cymru\" is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced ) are descended from the Brythonic word \"combrogi\", meaning \"fellow-countrymen\". Thus, they carry a sense of \"land of fellow-countrymen\", \"our country\", and notions of fraternity. The use of the word \"Cymry\" as a self-designation derives from the post-Roman Era relationship of the Welsh with the Brythonic-speaking peoples of northern England and southern Scotland, the peoples of \"Yr Hen Ogledd\" (). The word came into use as a self-description probably before the 7th century.\nIt is attested in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan (\"Moliant Cadwallon\", by Afan Ferddig) .\n\nIn Welsh literature, the word \"Cymry\" was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe the Welsh, though the older, more generic term \"Brythoniaid\" continued to be used to describe any of the Britonnic peoples, including the Welsh, and was the more common literary term until . Thereafter \"Cymry\" prevailed as a reference to the Welsh. Until the word was spelt \"Kymry\" or \"Cymry\", regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland.\n\nDuring their time in Britain, the ancient Romans encountered tribes in present-day Wales that they called the Ordovices, the Demetae, the Silures and the Deceangli. The people of what is now Wales were not distinguished from the rest of the peoples of southern Britain; all were called Britons and spoke the common British language, a Brythonic Celtic tongue. Celtic language and culture seems to have arrived in Britain during the Iron Age, though some archaeologists argue that there is no evidence for large-scale Iron Age migrations into Great Britain. The claim has also been made that Indo-European languages may have been introduced to the British Isles as early as the early Neolithic (or even earlier), with Goidelic and Brythonic languages developing indigenously. Others hold that the close similarity between the Goidelic and Brythonic branches, and their sharing of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age terminology with their continental relatives, point to a more recent introduction of Indo-European languages (or close communication), with Proto-Celtic itself unlikely to have existed before the end of the 2nd millennium BC at the earliest. The genetic evidence, in this case, would show that the change to Celtic languages in Britain may have occurred as a cultural shift rather than through migration as was previously supposed.\n\nSome current genetic research supports the idea that people living in the British Isles are likely mainly descended from the indigenous European Paleolithic (Old Stone Age hunter gatherers) population (about 80%), with a smaller Neolithic (New Stone Age farmers) input (about 20%). Paleolithic Europeans seem to have been a homogeneous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and expanded into Europe during the Mesolithic. The assumed genetic imprint of Neolithic incomers is seen as a cline, with stronger Neolithic representation in the east of Europe and stronger Paleolithic representation in the west of Europe. Most in Wales today regard themselves as modern Celts, claiming a heritage back to the Iron Age tribes, which themselves, based on modern genetic analysis, would appear to have had a predominantly Paleolithic and Neolithic indigenous ancestry. When the Roman legions departed Britain around 400, a Romano-British culture remained in the areas the Romans had settled, and the pre-Roman cultures in others.\n\nIn two recently published books, \"Blood of the Isles\", by Brian Sykes and \"The Origins of the British\", by Stephen Oppenheimer, both authors state that according to genetic evidence, most Welsh people, like most Britons, descend from the Iberian Peninsula in Southwest Europe, as a result of different migrations that took place during the Mesolithic and the Neolithic eras, and which laid the foundations for the present-day populations in the British Isles, indicating an ancient relationship among the populations of Atlantic Europe. According to Stephen Oppenheimer 96% of lineages in Llangefni in north Wales derive from Iberia. Genetic research on the Y-chromosome has shown that the Welsh, like the Irish, share a large proportion of their ancestry with the Basques of Northern Spain and South Western France, although the Welsh have a greater presumed Neolithic input than both the Irish and the Basques. Genetic marker R1b averages from 83–89% amongst the Welsh.\n\nDNA research conducted by CymruDNA Wales has shown that a percentage of Welshmen living today are descended from ancient Kings and Princes of Wales, the quintessential DNA signature R-L371 aka S300 snp downstream from R1b-L21 (S145) is believed to have originated in North Wales around 1000 AD. Recent DNA evidence suggests that Welsh people descended specifically from middle eastern DNA carriers, an idea previously proposed at least as early as the 19th century, in \"History of the Welsh Baptist\" by Jonathan Davis.\n\nThe people in what is now Wales continued to speak Brythonic languages with additions from Latin, as did some other Celts in areas of Great Britain. The surviving poem \"Y Gododdin\" is in early Welsh and refers to the Brythonic kingdom of Gododdin with a capital at Din Eidyn (Edinburgh) and extending from the area of Stirling to the Tyne. Offa's Dyke was erected in the mid-8th century, forming a barrier between Wales and Mercia.\n\nGene scientists at University College London (UCL) claimed in 2001 that the Welsh are the \"true\" Britons and are remnants of the Celts that were pushed out by nearby Anglo-Saxon invaders after the Roman withdrawal in the fifth century. The genetic tests suggested that between 50% and 100% of the indigenous population of what was to become England was wiped out. Research for a BBC programme on the Vikings suggested a possible strong link between the Celts and Basques, dating back tens of thousands of years. The UCL research suggested a migration on a huge scale during the Anglo-Saxon period. Dr Mark Thomas, of the Centre for Genetic Anthropology at UCL said, \"It appears England is made up of an ethnic cleansing event from people coming across from the continent after the Romans left. Our findings completely overturn the modern view of the origins of the English.\"\n\nThe process whereby the indigenous population of Wales came to think of themselves as Welsh is not clear. There is plenty of evidence of the use of the term \"Brythoniaid\" (Britons); by contrast, the earliest use of the word \"Kymry\" (referring not to the people but to the land—and possibly to northern Britain in addition to Wales) is found in a poem . The name of the region in northern England now known as Cumbria is derived from the same root. Only gradually did Cymru (the land) and Cymry (the people) come to supplant Brython. Although the Welsh language was certainly used at the time, Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke, the people to its west saw themselves as Roman, citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century. However, it is unclear whether such inscriptions reveal a general or normative use of Latin as a marker of identity or its selective use by the early Christian Church.\n\nThere was immigration to Wales after the Norman Conquest, several Normans encouraged immigration to their new lands; the Landsker Line dividing the Pembrokeshire \"Englishry\" and \"Welshry\" is still detectable today. The terms Englishry and Welshry are used similarly about Gower.\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts; especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also a large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish; and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, including Italians migrated to South Wales. Wales received other immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities immigrated particularly to urban Wales.\n\nIt is uncertain how many people in Wales consider themselves to be of Welsh ethnicity, because the 2001 UK census did not offer 'Welsh' as an option; respondents had to use a box marked \"Other\". Ninety-six per cent of the population of Wales thus described themselves as being White British. Controversy surrounding the method of determining ethnicity began as early as 2000, when it was revealed that respondents in Scotland and Northern Ireland would be able to tick a box describing themselves as of Scottish or of Irish ethnicity, an option not available for Welsh or English respondents. Prior to the census, Plaid Cymru backed a petition calling for the inclusion of a Welsh tick-box and for the National Assembly to have primary law-making powers and its own National Statistics Office.\n\nIn the absence of a Welsh tick-box, the only tick-boxes available were 'white-British,' 'Irish', or 'other'. The Scottish parliament insisted that a Scottish ethnicity tick-box be included in the census in Scotland, and with this inclusion as many as 88.11% claimed Scottish ethnicity. Critics argued that a higher proportion of respondents would have described themselves as of Welsh ethnicity had a Welsh tick-box been made available. Additional criticism was levelled at the timing of the census, which was taken in the middle of the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis. Organisers said that this had not affected the results. The foot-and-mouth crisis delayed the 2001 United Kingdom general election; the first time since the Second World War that any event had postponed an election.\n\nIn the census, as many as 14% of the population took the 'extra step' to write in that they were of Welsh ethnicity. The highest percentage of those identifying as of Welsh ethnicity was recorded in Gwynedd (at 27%), followed by Carmarthenshire (23%), Ceredigion (22%) and the Isle of Anglesey (19%). Among respondents between 16 and 74 years of age, those claiming Welsh ethnicity were predominantly in professional and managerial occupations.\n\nIn advance of the 2011 UK Census, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) launched a census consultation exercise. They received replies from 28 different Welsh organisations and a large proportion of these referred to Welsh ethnicity, language or identity.\n\nFor the first time ever in British census history the 2011 Census gave the opportunity for people to describe their identity as Welsh or English. A 'dress rehearsal' of the Census was carried out on the Welsh island of Anglesey because of its rural nature \"and\" its high numbers of Welsh speakers.\n\nThe Census, taken on 27 March 2011, asked a number of questions relating to nationality and national identity, including \"What is your country of birth?\" ('Wales' was one of the options), \"How would you describe your national identity?\" (for the first time 'Welsh' and 'English' were included as options), \"What is your ethnic group?\" ('White Welsh/English/Scottish/Northern Irish/British' was an option) and \"Can you understand, speak, read or write Welsh?\".\n\nAs of the 2011 census in Wales, 66 per cent (2.0 million) of residents reported a Welsh national identity (either on its own or combined with other identities). Most residents of Wales (96 per cent, 2.9 million) reported at least one national identity of English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, or British. Of the 66 per cent (2.0 million) of Welsh residents who considered themselves to have a Welsh national identity in Wales in 2011, 218,000 responded that they had Welsh and British national identity. Just under 17 per cent (519,000) of people in Wales considered themselves to have a British national identity only.\n\nA survey published in 2001, by the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends at Oxford University (sample size 1161), found that 14.6 per cent of respondents described themselves as British, not Welsh; 8.3 per cent saw themselves as more British than Welsh; 39.0 per cent described themselves as equally Welsh and British; 20.2 per cent saw themselves as more Welsh than British; and 17.9 per cent described themselves as Welsh, not British.\n\nMost Welsh people of faith are affiliated with the Church in Wales or other Christian denominations such as the Presbyterian Church of Wales, Catholicism, and Russian Orthodox Christianity. Wales has a long tradition of nonconformism and Methodism. Some Welsh people are affiliated with other religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Sikhism.\n\nThe 2001 Census showed that slightly fewer than 10% of the Welsh population are regular church or chapel goers (a slightly smaller proportion than in England or Scotland), although about 70% of the population see themselves as Christian in some form. Judaism has quite a long history in Wales, with a Jewish community recorded in Swansea from around 1730. In August 1911, during a period of public order and industrial disputes, Jewish shops across the South Wales coalfield were damaged by mobs. Since that time the Jewish population of that area, which reached a peak of 4,000–5,000 in 1913, has declined; only Cardiff has retained a sizeable Jewish population, of about 2000 in the 2001 Census. The largest non-Christian faith in Wales is Islam, with about 22,000 members in 2001 served by about 40 mosques, following the first mosque established in Cardiff. A college for training clerics has been established at Llanybydder in West Wales. Islam arrived in Wales in the mid 19th century, and it is thought that Cardiff's Yemeni community is Britain's oldest Muslim community, established when the city was one of the world's largest coal exporting ports. Hinduism and Buddhism each have about 5,000 adherents in Wales, with the rural county of Ceredigion being the centre of Welsh Buddhism. Govinda's temple and restaurant, run by the Hare Krishnas in Swansea, is a focal point for many Welsh Hindus. There are about 2,000 Sikhs in Wales, with the first purpose-built gurdwara opened in the Riverside area of Cardiff in 1989. In 2001 some 7,000 people classified themselves as following \"other religions\", including a reconstructed form of Druidism, which was the pre-Christian religion of Wales (not to be confused with the Druids of the Gorsedd at the National Eisteddfod of Wales). Approximately one-sixth of the population, some 500,000 people, profess no religious faith whatsoever.\n\nThe Sabbatarian temperance movement was also historically strong among the Welsh; the sale of alcohol was prohibited on Sundays in Wales by the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881 – the first legislation specifically issued for Wales since the Middle Ages. From the early 1960s, local council areas were permitted to hold referendums every seven years to determine whether they should be \"wet\" or \"dry\" on Sundays: most of the industrialised areas in the east and south went \"wet\" immediately, and by the 1980s the last district, Dwyfor in the northwest, went wet; since then there have been no more Sunday-closing referendums.\n\nThe Welsh language is in the Insular Celtic family; historically spoken throughout Wales, with its predecessor Common Brittonic once spoken throughout most of the island of Great Britain. Prior to the 20th century, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh, with little or no fluent knowledge of English. Welsh remains the predominant language in parts of Wales, particularly in North Wales and parts of West Wales. \n\nAccording to the 2001 census the number of Welsh speakers in Wales increased for the first time in 100 years, with 20.5% of a population of over 2.9 million claiming fluency in Welsh. In addition, 28% of the population of Wales claimed to understand Welsh. The census revealed that the increase was most significant in urban areas, such as Cardiff with an increase from 6.6% in 1991 to 10.9% in 2001, and Rhondda Cynon Taf with an increase from 9% in 1991 to 12.3% in 2001. However, the proportion of Welsh speakers declined in Gwynedd from 72.1% in 1991 to 68.7% in 2001, and in Ceredigion from 59.1% in 1991 to 51.8% in 2001. The greatest fluctuation was in Ceredigion, with a 19.5% influx of new residents since 1991.\n\nThe decline in Welsh speakers in much of rural Wales is attributable to non-Welsh-speaking residents moving to North Wales, driving up property prices above what locals may afford, according to former Gwynedd county councillor Seimon Glyn of Plaid Cymru, whose controversial comments in 2001 focused attention on the issue. As many as a third of all properties in Gwynedd are bought by people from outside Wales. The issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.\n\nA Plaid Cymru taskforce headed by Dafydd Wigley recommended land should be allocated for affordable local housing, called for grants for locals to buy houses, and recommended that council tax on holiday homes should double.\n\nHowever, the same census shows that 25% of residents were born outside Wales. The number of Welsh speakers in other places in Britain is uncertain, but there are significant numbers in the main cities, and there are speakers along the Welsh-English border.\n\nEven among Welsh speakers, very few people speak only Welsh, with nearly all being bilingual in English. However, a large number of Welsh speakers are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English. Some prefer to speak English in South Wales or the urbanised areas and Welsh in the North or in rural areas. A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain (known in linguistics as code-switching).\n\nDue to an increase in Welsh-language nursery education, recent census data reveals a reversal of decades of linguistic decline: there are now more Welsh speakers under five years of age than over 60. For many young people in Wales, the acquisition of Welsh is a gateway to better careers, according to research from the Welsh Language Board and Careers Wales. The Welsh Government identified media as one of six areas likely to experience greater demand for Welsh speakers: the sector is Wales's third-largest revenue earner.\n\nAlthough Welsh is a minority language, and thus threatened by the dominance of English, support for the language grew during the second half of the 20th century, along with the rise of Welsh nationalism in the form of groups such as the political party Plaid Cymru and Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society). The language is used in the bilingual Welsh Assembly and entered on its records, with English translation. The high cost of translation from English to Welsh has proved controversial. In the past the rules of the British Parliament forbade the use of Welsh in any proceedings. Only English was allowed as the only language all members were assumed to speak. In 2017, the UK government agreed to support the use of Welsh in the Welsh Grand Committee, although not in parliamentary debate in the house outside of this committee. In 2018 Welsh was used in the grand committee for the first time.\n\nWelsh as a first language is largely concentrated in the less urban north and west of Wales, principally Gwynedd, inland Denbighshire, northern and south-western Powys, the Isle of Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, North Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, and parts of western Glamorgan, although first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales. However, Cardiff is now home to an urban Welsh-speaking population (both from other parts of Wales and from the growing Welsh-medium schools of Cardiff itself) due to the centralisation and concentration of national resources and organisations in the capital.\n\nFor some, speaking Welsh is an important part of their Welsh identity. Parts of the culture are strongly connected to the language — notably the Eisteddfod tradition, poetry and aspects of folk music and dance. Wales also has a strong tradition of poetry in the English language.\n\nPatagonian Welsh (Cymraeg y Wladfa) is a dialect of the Welsh language which is spoken in Y Wladfa in the Argentine region, Patagonia.\n\n\nThere has been migration from Wales to the rest of Britain throughout its history. During the Industrial Revolution thousands of Welsh people migrated, for example, to Liverpool and Ashton-in-Makerfield. As a result, some people from England, Scotland and Ireland have Welsh surnames.\n\nWelsh settlers moved to other parts of Europe, concentrated in certain areas. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a small wave of contract miners from Wales arrived in Northern France; the centres of Welsh-French population are in coal mining towns, and particularly the French department of Pas-de-Calais along with miners from many other countries. They tended to cluster in communities around their churches.\n\nSettlers from Wales (and later Patagonian Welsh) arrived in Newfoundland in the early 19th century, and founded towns in Labrador's coast region; in 1819, the ship \"Albion\" left Cardigan for New Brunswick, carrying Welsh settlers to Canada; on board were 27 Cardigan families, many of whom were farmers. In 1852, Thomas Benbow Phillips of Tregaron established a settlement of about 100 Welsh people in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil.\n\nInternationally Welsh people have emigrated, in relatively small numbers (in proportion to population, Irish emigration to the USA may have been 26 times greater than Welsh emigration), to many countries, including the USA (in particular, Pennsylvania), Canada and Y Wladfa in Patagonia, Argentina. Jackson County, Ohio was sometimes referred to as \"Little Wales\", and one of several communities where Welsh was widely spoken. There was a Welsh language press but by the late 1940s, the last Welsh language newspaper, \"y Drych\" began to publish in English. Malad City in Idaho, which began as a Welsh Mormon settlement, lays claim to a greater proportion of inhabitants of Welsh descent than anywhere outside Wales itself. Malad's local High School is known as the \"Malad Dragons\", and flies the Welsh Flag as its school colours. Welsh people have also settled in New Zealand and Australia.\n\nAround 1.75 million Americans report themselves to have Welsh ancestry, as did 458,705 Canadians in Canada's 2011 census. This compares with 2.9 million people living in Wales (as of the 2001 census).\n\nThere is no known evidence which would objectively support the legend that the Mandan, a Native American tribe of the central United States, are Welsh emigrants who reached North America under Prince Madog in 1170.\n\nThe Ukrainian city of Donetsk was founded in 1869 by a Welsh businessman, John Hughes (an engineer from Merthyr Tydfil) who constructed a steel plant and several coal mines in the region; the town was thus named \"Yuzovka\" (Юзовка) in recognition of his role in its founding (\"Yuz\" being a Russian or Ukrainian approximation of Hughes).\n\nFormer Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was born in Barry, Wales. After she suffered from bronchopneumonia as a child, her parents were advised that it would aid her recovery to live in a warmer climate. This led the family to migrate to Australia in 1966, settling in Adelaide.\n\n\n\n"}

For a century it was the body responsible for re-distributing farmland in most of Ireland.\n\nWith the Ashbourne Act 1885, the Commission developed into a tenant-purchasing commission and assisted in the agreed transfer of freehold farmland from landlord to tenant. This was a response to the turbulent Land War that had started in 1879. It was rapidly enacted by the government of Lord Salisbury, was funded initially with £5,000,000, and was designed to avert support for the Irish Parliamentary Party, given the larger number of voters allowed by the Reform Act 1884, before the IPP entered its alliance with William Ewart Gladstone in 1886.\nThe Commission eventually transferred 13.5 million acres (55,000 km²) by 1920. Following the Land Conference of December 1902 arranged by George Wyndham (a conservative minister and Chief Secretary for Ireland, but also descended from Lord Edward FitzGerald), the revolutionary Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903 was orchestrated through Parliament by William O'Brien, MP, which provided government finance to buy out freeholds, with the former tenant farmers paying back the capital over 68 years. This was managed by the Land Commission, along with ancillary work such as compiling statistics. Valuations were reckoned on a \"years purchase\" (Y.P.) basis, the price being a multiple of (perhaps 16 times) the annual rent, instead of the discounted cash flow method used today. The Commission had to supervise the haggling process and find the fairest multiple for every transfer. The loans issued by government were resold in the capital markets as \"Land Bonds\".\n\nBy 1908 the emerging problem was whether the new owners would be economically viable on their small farms. Michael McDonnell commented that - \"The breaking up of the grazing lands, which in many instances the landlords are keeping back from the market, has not met with much success under the Act, and it is difficult to see how compulsion is to be avoided if the country is to be saved from the economically disastrous position of having established in it a number of occupying owners on tenancies which are not large enough to secure to them a living wage.\"\n\nIt was realised by now that existing rural poverty arose from small farm sizes, yet the Acts' procedures and limits also tended to keep farm sizes down. The aim had been to create \"peasant proprietors\" owning what were usually small farms. By definition the activists in the 1880s Land War period had been poorer and more desperate, and few came from larger prosperous farms. This remained a matter of policy debate for the rest of the Commission's existence; generally it continued to create new small units by breaking up larger units that had more commercial potential. Larger commercial farmers were characterised as \"landlords\" or \"grazers\" simply because they had more land than the average.\n\nA further Land Act, the \"Land Purchase (Ireland) Act (1909), fostered by the liberal Chief Secretary for Ireland Augustine Birrell, allowed for tenanted land purchase where the owner was unwilling to sell, to be bought by the Commission by compulsory purchase. \n\nIn 1915 Birrell confirmed in Parliament that all Irish land transfers from 1885 to the end of 1914 had cost the British Government £91,768,450, and the tenants had invested a further £1,584,516.\n\nAfter the 1921 Partition of Ireland, the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922, abolished many all-island offices, including the Land Commissioners, effective from the creation of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. The Land Commission files for Northern Ireland were separated, allowing for the Land Commission to be re-established in and for the Free State in 1923 as if it had never been abolished.\n\nDuring the Irish War of Independence some farms were seized, and in June 1920 the Dáil debated a motion proposed by Arthur Griffith as Minister for Home Affairs, and approved a decree stating that all claims to land should not be adjudicated on until after the end of the war.\n\nThe Land Acts were varied in Northern Ireland in 1925, and the activities of the Land Commission were finally abolished in 1935. Some remaining tenants who had chosen not to exercise their right to buy their farms formed the Unbought Tenants' Association.\n\nThe Commission was reconstituted in the Irish Free State by section 2 of the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923, backdated to the state's creation. The Act also dissolved the Congested Districts Board (the CDB). Provision was made for compulsory purchase of land owned by a non-Irish citizen. Untenanted land could now be compulsorily purchased and divided out to local families; this was applied unevenly across the State, with some large estates surviving if the owners could show that their land was being actively farmed.\n\nFrom 1923, the amounts outstanding were paid to the British Government as \"land annuities\", accruing in a Land Purchase Fund. This was fixed at £250,000 annually in 1925. In December 1925 W. T. Cosgrave lamented that there were already: \"250,000 occupiers of uneconomic holdings, the holdings of such a valuation as did not permit of a decent livelihood for the owners\". Despite this, his government continued to subdivide larger landholdings, primarily to gain electoral support.\n\nThe Land Act 1933, passed on a vote of 70-39, allowed the Minister for Finance to divert the annuities for local government projects. This was a factor that caused the \"Economic war\" in 1933-38, and was mutually resolved by a one-off payment of £10m. to Britain in 1938. From 1932 the government argued strongly that Irish farmers should no longer be obliged for historic reasons to pay Britain for Irish land, but when Britain had passed out of the payment system it illogically still required farmers to continue to pay their annuities to it as before.\n\nIn 1983, the Commission ceased acquiring land; this signified the start of the end of the Commission's reform of Irish land ownership, though freehold transfers of farmland still had to be signed off by the Commission into the 1990s. The commission was dissolved on 31 March 1999 by the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992 and most of the remaining liabilities and assets were transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Many relevant historical records are held by the National Archives of Ireland.\n\nThe Commission, whilst often regarded as the champion of land ownership for those who used it, and social justice, was not without controversy. In particular its subdivision of land into uneconomic units has had a lasting effect, as well as the destruction of fine landlords' residences such as Monellan Castle and Shanbally Castle with Government approval. As farming became more mechanized from the 1930s, foreign investment in commercial farms was discouraged, reducing overall farm output. Often the buyers found it hard to earn enough to live a good life, as found in the poems of Patrick Kavanagh. The Dáil reports from the 1920s to the 1960s frequently include questions about the division of former estates, and the acquisition of land with public finance on favourable terms for constituents via the Land Commission was understood as a way for politicians to gain electoral support.\n\nFrom 1940 a minority in Fianna Fáil and Coalition cabinets consistently argued for larger farms to be encouraged, instead of sponsoring new small farmers that often had too little capital, skills or enthusiasm. This was successfully opposed for social and political reasons by Éamon de Valera, and in Coalition governments by Joseph Blowick, the leader of Clann na Talmhan.\n\nUnder the 1923 Act, busier farmers had to rent extra land under an 11-month or seasonal \"conacre\" system, as longer arrangements could cause an owner to lose his farm by compulsory purchase by the Land Commission. While there were now some 300,000 Irish landowners compared to several thousand in the 1800s, the basic term for the use of land had reverted to the norm of the 1860s, with no rights to renew a lease and no incentive to improve rented land. By 1980 some were rented annually under conacre, suggesting a new imbalance between mere ownership and the more active farmers. The cost of agricultural machinery requires larger farm sizes to generate economies of scale.\n\nThe Lands Act 1965 was passed to restrict new foreign investment in agriculture, some of which was speculatively based upon the Republic of Ireland's imminent entry into the European Economic Community that eventually occurred in 1973. The EEC's \"Four Freedoms\" allowed for unlimited investment anywhere in the EEC by any citizen of an EEC member state. This naturally undermined the ethos of the Land Commission, which had processed a further since 1923. By the early 1970s, half of open market land purchases were by non-farmers, and half of those were to buy small sites, typically for building bungalows.\n\nBy the 1980s, just before its reform, the Land Commission came under the Department of Lands, which was in turn a part of the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Lands was seen as an overgrown entity, employing 750 people in 1983; its budget of IR£15m included IR£8m for administration costs and only IR£7m for actual land purchase or division. Further purchases were suspended that year by Paul Connaughton. Civil servants working for the Land Commission were reassigned to work on related matters. An act to formally dissolve the commission was passed by the Oireachtas in 1992, \"to give statutory effect to the position which [had] obtained since 1983\". Minister Michael O'Kennedy explained the act's provisions: \nThe act came into force in 1999.\n\n"}

Householders would provide these platforms to appease witches and avoid their ill favour.\n\nTraditional vernacular architecture in Jersey is in granite and such witches' stones can be seen protruding from many older houses. The real origin of this architectural feature is to protect thatched roofs from seeping water running down the sides of the chimney stack. Thatched roofs being thicker than tiled roofs, the jutting stones would sit snugly on the thatch – as can be seen on the few remaining thatched roofs in Jersey. When thatch began to be generally replaced by pantiles in the 18th century, and later by slates, the witches' stones were left protruding prominently from the chimney stack. This either gave rise to the belief in witches' resting places, or reinforced an existing belief (fear of witches was widespread in country areas well into the 20th century in Jersey).\n\nThe force of tradition can be seen in a number of newly constructed houses in vernacular style that sport witches' stones despite never having had a thatched roof.\n\nAlthough not common in England, witch stones or witch seats can be found in the villages of Feizor, near Settle, and at Wharfe both in North Yorkshire.\n\n\n"}

(1750 – February 6, 1825), was an Irish-born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. A Dominican friar, he served as the second Bishop of New York from 1814 until his death in 1825.\n\nJohn Connolly was born in County Meath, Ireland; according to various sources, he was born in either Slane or Drogheda. Dominican historian Victor O'Daniel reports that Connolly's family had a tenant farm on the Hill of Slane. After receiving his early education in his native country, he continued his studies in Belgium, and entered the Order of Friars Preachers, more commonly known as the Dominican friars, at an early age. He was subsequently sent to Rome, where he was ordained to the priesthood on September 24, 1774. Among the various capacities he filled in Rome, Connolly served as a professor at the Dominican convent of St. Clement, of which institution he later became prior. He was also an agent of the Irish bishops, and saved the English and Irish colleges—as well as his own convent, church, and library—from being plundered by the French invaders.\n\nOn October 4, 1814, Connolly was appointed the second Bishop of New York in the United States by Pope Pius VII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 6 from Cardinal Cesare Brancadoro, with Archbishops Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri and Giovanni Marchetti serving as co-consecrators, in Rome. \n\nConnolly set sail from Italy and stopped in Ireland on the way. At St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny, he attempted to recruit priests for his new diocese. He did not reach New York until November 24, 1815. He arrived on board the \"Sally\" from a transatlantic trip that took all of sixty-seven days, and Connolly had been presumed lost at sea.\n\nSince the first Bishop of New York, R. Luke Concanen, O.P., had been impeded from sailing for New York due to the embargo of Europe then in place, Connolly was the first bishop of the diocese to minister personally to his flock. He is described as having been a \"small-sized man\" and a person of more than ordinary mildness and gentleness of character, who would travel the city on foot to attend to the poor and sick.\n\nAccording to historian Peter Guilday, \"It may well be doubted if, in the entire history of the Catholic Church in the United States, any other bishop began his episcopal life under such disheartening conditions.\" At the time of Connolly's arrival, the diocese covered all of New York and part of New Jersey, with four priests, three churches, and approximately 15,000 Catholics, most of them Irish, along with some English, French and Germans. There were three churches: St. Peter's on Barclay Street, St. Patrick's on Mulberry St., and St. Mary's in Albany. During his tenure, he erected churches in Utica and Rochester, founded an orphanage, and introduced the Sisters of Charity. He traveled over 1,000 miles on horseback, preaching and bringing the sacraments to half-starved immigrants, largely from Ireland, who were building the Erie Canal. \n\nConnolly died on February 6, 1825 at age 74. He is interred at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral He body was later displaced to a vault by the trustees to make way for that of an influential layman. It was not rediscovered until the building was renovated in 1976. Terence Cardinal Cooke had it reinterred in St. Patrick's Old Cathedral. \n"}

(also known as What Ever Happened to Baby Jane...?) is a 1991 American made-for-television thriller film directed by David Greene and adapted for the small screen by Brian Taggert. It is based on the novel \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" by Henry Farrell and the 1962 theatrical film of the same name. It stars real-life sisters Lynn Redgrave as Baby Jane Hudson and Vanessa Redgrave as Blanche Hudson, in the roles previously played by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the 1962 adaptation.\n\nThe film was adapted to contemporary times, with Blanche's film success taking place in the 1960s instead of the 1930s. Her films were being rediscovered on home video instead of television reruns. Jane had been a child film star (replacing the original's vaudeville success), though her films were unavailable, leading to her jealousy.\n\nIn the 1940s, Baby Jane Hudson is a world-famous child star. Jane dominates her shy sister Blanche, who, as Jane's understudy and stunt double, longs to have an acting career separate from Jane. It is implied that Jane tends to become jealous when their father shows affection to Blanche. By the 1960s, Blanche has become a serious and celebrated actress, while Jane's career fades into obscurity after childhood. She appears in smaller roles in Blanche's films where her scenes usually get edited out. Blanche's career was cut short by a car accident that paralyzed her from the waist down, after which Jane was committed to a psychiatric hospital. The tabloids suggested that a jealous Jane had run down her more talented sister with the car and then gone insane with guilt.\n\nIn the present day, the sisters live together in a crumbling Brentwood mansion, where a somewhat unstable Jane, who still dresses herself like a 10-year-old, tends the paraplegic Blanche. Blanche's films have recently become available on video and television, launching her into a modest comeback. Jane resents both her sister's enduring popularity and her own role as caretaker, and takes out her resentment on Blanche with vicious, childlike pranks such as putting worms in Blanche's food and cutting all of Blanche's hair. Jane also intercepts all mail addressed to her sister, including fan mail. She reminds Blanche that it was her success that helped her start her career by paying for everything, including her acting classes. Blanche and her physical therapist, Dominick, worry that Jane's old mental problems are returning, and that her pranks might turn violent if she finds out Blanche is selling the house.\n\nHoping that she can also stage a comeback, Jane goes to a video store to see which of her old films are available. Billy Korn, the store's owner, recognizes her as Baby Jane, much to her delight. Believing that the Hudson sisters must be extremely wealthy, Billy recommends himself as her manager and promises to arrange a spot in a talent show for $1,000. Jane is thrilled by his attention and agrees.\n\nBack at home, Blanche makes her way to a telephone and tries to call for help from the sisters' psychiatrist, only to have Jane overhear the conversation and then physically attack her. As Jane impersonates her on the telephone talking to the doctor, Blanche realizes that her sister has become completely insane. She tries to escape, but Jane locks her in a room upstairs with no means of communication. After being starved for days, Blanche rummages through drawers for food and finds checks with her forged signature, rendering her unnecessary for Jane to access her money. Dominick arrives for his weekly appointment and has to force his way around Jane and into Blanche's room, where he finds her bound and gagged. Before he can help, Jane stabs Dominick to death with a pair of scissors and hides his body in the basement screening room, then leaves for the performance Billy has arranged for her.\n\nJane arrives at the show, only to discover that the \"talent show\" is actually a drag revue and that Billy is dressed as Blanche for their duet. The audience ridicules Jane's appearance and performance, leading her to suffer a mental breakdown and run offstage. Still dressed as Blanche, Billy follows, arriving back at the mansion ahead of Jane. While searching the house for money, he finds Blanche, but leaves without helping her, instead going to Jane for his money. Jane, still in shock, mistakes him for an escaped Blanche and stabs him to death.\n\nFinally coming to her senses, Jane puts Blanche into her car and drives to the beach, where her fondest memories with the family took place during their childhood. Severely dehydrated and weak from starvation, Blanche admits she had been driving the car on the night of the accident, but had allowed Jane, who had been too incapacitated with drugs and alcohol to remember, to take the blame. She apologizes for never telling Jane the truth, and they are momentarily happy together. The police arrive to find Blanche unconscious and near death. As they radio for help for Blanche, Jane realizes what is happening and walks into the sea, seemingly to kill herself, but is dragged out by a police officer. At first she resists, but then she wraps her arms around him and calls him \"Papa\". The last shot is of Jane's smiling face as she goes willingly with the police.\n\n\n\"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" is an American suspense novel by Henry Farrell published in 1960 by Rinehart & Company. The novel has earned a cult following.\n\nBeing set during the 1990s as opposed to the 1960s in the original story, the film takes a modern overtone including Baby Jane being a film actress instead of a vaudevillian, and Blanche's use of the stairlift and cassette tape. Characters Elvira Stitt the cleaning lady and Edwin Flagg are replaced with Dominick the physical therapist and Billy Korn. The film also features scenes depicting the 1990s downtown district of Hollywood.\n\n"}

{"id": "2030277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030277", "title": "Sankt Goar", "text": "Sankt Goar\n\nSankt Goar is a town on the west bank of the Middle Rhine in the Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis (district) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" Hunsrück-Mittelrhein, whose seat is in Emmelshausen.\n\nSankt Goar is well known for its central location in the Rhine Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since July 2002. Above the town stand the ruins of Burg Rheinfels, one of the castles for which the Middle Rhine is famous, and across the river lies the sister town of Sankt Goarshausen with its own castles, Katz and Maus (“Cat” and “Mouse”). The famous Lorelei rock is close-by, slightly upstream on the opposite bank.\n\nSankt Goar lies in the Rhine Gorge and the narrow canal on the Rhine that flows through the Rhein Massive. This part of the gorge on the left bank borders on the edge of the Rhein - Hunsrück, on the right bank it Borders on the Banks of the Taunus. The characteristic narrow-valley form came into use through downcutting in a massive that was undergoing an uplift.\n\nThe nearest major Towns are the city of Koblenz, some 24 km to the north, and the town of Bingen am Rhein, some 25 km to the southeast, in both cases as the crow flies. Sankt Goar is linked by the Loreley Ferry with its sister town of Sankt Goarshausen directly across the Rhine. The Rhine's width here is roughly 250 m.\n\nIn Sankt Goar and the Gründelbach, Rainwater flows from the Hunsrück and empties into the Rhine.\n\nThe town is made up of several parts that belong to St. Goar, The main centre on the Rhine, also called Sankt Goar, two centres up on the heights, Biebernheim and Werlau, and two further centres on the Rhine, Fellen to the north and “An der Loreley” to the south.\n\nThe area around what is now the town of Sankt Goar was already settled in Roman times. The name in the Early Middle Ages was \"Wochara\", after a short brook emptying into the Rhine here.\n\nThe name by which the town goes today is from Goar of Aquitaine, who came to live on the site where the town now stands during Frankish, Merovingian King Childebert I’s reign (511-538). Goar came as a young clergyman (actually, a monk) from Aquitaine in the southwest of France and at first lived as a hermit in a cave on the Rhine. With leave from the Bishop of Trier, he worked as a missionary to the local people. He was well known for his great hospitality, particularly towards the Rhine boatmen. Later, he built on the site where the town now stands a hospice and a chapel. Many legends gathered about him. After his death, about 575, Goar’s grave became a pilgrimage site and the place was named after him. Frankish King Pepin the Younger transferred the hospice and chapel in 765 to the Abbot of the Benedictine Prüm Abbey as a personal benefice. From this grew the Sankt Goar Canonical Foundation, witnessed as early as the late 11th century.\n\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" notes that “a small church” was dedicated to Goar of Aquitaine in 1768 “in the little town on the banks of the Rhine which bears his name (St. Goar).” It is also reported that Charlemagne built a church over the site of Goar's hermitage. It is around this church that the town of Sankt Goar grew on the left bank of the Rhine between Wesel and Boppard.\n\nBeginning in 1190, the town was under military protection and the jurisdiction of the Counts of Katzenelnbogen, the monastery \"Vögte\", who had taken ownership. In 1245, Count Diether V of Katzenelnbogen built the castle, Burg Rheinfels. When the last of the Counts of Katzenelnbogen died in 1479, Sankt Goar passed to the Landgraviate of Hesse. On 1 November 1527, Adam Krafft, who would later be a professor of theology, began to introduce the Reformation on a mission from Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. In 1567, upon Philip's death, the Landgraviate of Hesse was divided among his four sons. His youngest son, Philip II, Landgrave of Hesse-Rheinfels, was awarded the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen, and thereby the castle and the town. In 1580, 175 people in Sankt Goar fell victim to the Plague; only 18 years later, in 1598, it claimed another 142. In 1635, in the midst of the Thirty Years' War, more than 200 people died in another outbreak. In 1598, Franz Schmoll built the \"Rheinfels-Apotheke\" in Sankt Goar, only the third apothecary in Hesse, after the ones in Kassel and Marburg.\n\nAs a result of a longstanding dispute between Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt over the partitioning of the Landgraviate of Hesse, the latter had Burg Rheinfels and Sankt Goar besieged for several weeks in the summer of 1626 with help from Imperial troops. which eventually led to the town's capitulation and its attendant plundering by Spanish troops. Between 1626 and 1647, Sankt Goar belonged to Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1647, troops of Landgravine Amalie Elisabeth of Hesse-Kassel conquered the castle and the town. On 14 April 1648, George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt ceded the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen along with Sankt Goar “in perpetuity” to Hesse-Kassel.\n\nWhile Hesse-Kassel was under Imperial law the rightful landholder, lordship over the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen passed to Landgrave Ernst I, who on 30 March 1649 made his entrance into Sankt Goar and founded the Hesse-Rheinfels(-Rotenburg) line. Landgrave Ernst ruled until his death in 1693 at Burg Rheinfels, his comital residence, as one who was tolerant in matters of religion, and one who took great interest in his office, contributing considerably to Sankt Goar's economic growth, something the town sorely needed after the ravages that it had sustained in the Thirty Years' War. In the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the \"Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg\", or War of the Palatine Succession), however, the town and the castle lay under siege yet again, this time by 28,000 French troops. Despite attempts at storming the town, they could not penetrate its defences. In 1711, after a dispute over inheritance, Landgrave William of Hesse-Wanfried was awarded the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rheinfels; he then called himself William of Hesse-Rheinfels. The Emperor transferred the castle to him in 1718. In 1731, Christian of Hessen-Wanfried (known since 1711 as Hessen-Eschwege) inherited the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rheinfels along with the castle. The castle was ceded to Hesse-Kassel for good in 1735. In 1755, after Christian's death, the Landgraviate passed to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rotenburg. In 1794, the castle was given up to French Revolutionary troops without a fight, and in 1796 and 1797, great parts of it were blown up. French rule lasted until 1813.\n\nIn 1815, the castle passed into Prussian hands and Sankt Goar became a district seat. After the First World War, the town was for a while once again occupied by the French. The Second World War, too, came to Sankt Goar. In mid March 1945, American troops reached the town and occupied it, although occupational authority was transferred, once again, to the French in early July. Since 1946, Sankt Goar has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, the district of Sankt Goar, whose seat the town had been, was dissolved in 1969 and the town was grouped into the Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis, whose seat was in Simmern. In 1972, the town also became part of the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Sankt Goar-Oberwesel.\n\nIn the course of administrative restructuring, the new \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Sankt Goar-Oberwesel was formed on 22 April 1972 out of the towns of Sankt Goar and Oberwesel, with its seat in the latter town.\n\nOn 7 June 1969, the formerly self-administering municipalities of Biebernheim and Werlau were amalgamated with Sankt Goar.\n\nThe table shows population figures for selected years since the early 17th century.\n\nThe council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:\nThe voter turnout for this latest municipal election was 61.0%. This contrasts with 67.5% in 2004 and 70.4% in 1999.\n\nSankt Goar's mayor is Horst Vogt (CDU), and his deputies are Gerhard Rolinger, Elisabeth Hein and Walter Mallman.\n\nThe German blazon reads: \"Im geteilten Schild oben in Gold ein blaubewehrter roter Löwe (heraldisch Leopard), unten hinter einem goldenen Gitter goldene Lilien auf blauen Feld.\"\n\nThe town's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess Or a demilion guardant gules armed, langued and crowned azure, and azure trellised with each space charged with a fleur-de-lis of the first.\n\nThe charge in the upper part of the escutcheon is the heraldic emblem formerly borne by the Counts of Katzenelnbogen, who ruled Sankt Goar from the 13th century. Sankt Goar was the centre of the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen. The lilies in the lower part of the escutcheon refer to Saint Mary's patronage of Darmstadt, the centre of the Upper County of Katzenelnbogen.\n\nThe town colours are red and white.\n\nSankt Goar fosters partnerships with the following places:\n\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate’s Directory of Cultural Monuments:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe castle, Burg Rheinfels, stands – or rather lies in ruins – above Sankt Goar and was founded in 1245 by Count Diether of Katzenelnbogen. After it had been expanded into a fort, it was the biggest defensive complex in the Rhine Gorge and set the standard for castle building throughout the Empire. In the late 18th century, French Revolutionary troops destroyed the fort, after which the complex was used as a stone quarry for other building work. In 1843, Prince William of Prussia, later Kaiser Wilhelm I, acquired the ruin, thus preventing further destruction. Since 1925, the town of Sankt Goar has owned the castle. Today the complex houses a hotel operation and an inn. Also, it houses the town's local history museum.\n\nThe Evangelical Collegiate Church, consecrated to Saint Goar, in the centre of Sankt Goar is a church with Romanesque and Gothic features. The three-vaulted Romanesque crypt comes from the late 11th century. In the three-naved church up above are wall paintings from the latter half of the 15th century.\n\nThe \"Katholische Pfarrkirche zum Hl. Goar\" (Catholic Parish Church) was built in the late 19th century in the Gothic Revival style. Worth seeing are Saint Goar's Late Gothic tomb slab and a retable from 1480, which is among the most valuable works of Middle-Rhine painting.\n\nThe \"Deutsches Puppen- und Bärenmuseum\" (“German Doll and Bear Museum”) on Sonnengasse (lane) in Sankt Goar has since 1985 been giving visitors a review of the dolls, teddy bears and other toys from various generations. In an area of 600 m², more than 3,000 pieces from various collectors are exhibited. Moreover, the museum provides knowledge about dollmaking, doll tailoring and the work done in the museum's own doll and bear clinic.\n\nThe \"Wahrschauer- und Lotsenmuseum\" in Sankt Goar, dedicated to boat signalling and pilotage on the Middle Rhine, is found at a former pilotage and signalling station at the \"Bankeck\" at river kilometre 555.43. The museum collects and keeps extensive information about the history of shipping on the Rhine. Just outside the museum is an outdoor area where exhibits from the pilots’ and signalmen's daily life may be viewed. The museum is open from May to September.\n\nAt the local history museum at Burg Rheinfels are exhibits from the town's and the castle's history.\n\n\nThe town's main industry is tourism. Other industries are winegrowing and agriculture.\n\nIn 1240 the Counts of Katzenelnbogen owned a vineyard called Amererberge.\n\nSankt Goar's vineyards lie in the winemaking subregion of \"Rheinburgengau\" within the Middle Rhine wine region. The local winemaking appellation – \"Großlage\" – that belongs to this subregion comprises four smaller operations – \"Einzellagen\" – around Sankt Goar. Three of them, \"Rosenberg\", \"Frohwingert\" and \"Ameisenberg\", lie on the Gründelbach valley's steep slopes, while the fourth, \"Kuhstall\", lies on the slope on the side of the Rhine Gorge opposite the Loreley. The vineyards are all steeply terraced and are planted mainly with Riesling.\n\nIn German linguistics, the Sankt Goar Line is an isogloss separating dialects to the north from those to the south. See High German consonant shift.\n\nRunning through Sankt Goar (main centre) and the outlying centre of Fellen is \"Bundesstraße\" 9. Sankt Goar is linked to the Autobahn A 61 (Ludwigshafen-Mönchengladbach) by \"Landesstraße\" (State Road) 213, which leads to the Emmelshausen interchange (no. 42) 14 km away. For some years, planning has been under way for a Middle Rhine bridge between Sankt Goar and Sankt Goarshausen. It would be the first bridge across the Middle Rhine on the roughly 100-kilometre-long stretch between Koblenz and Wiesbaden.\n\nThe Sankt Goar railway station lies on the West Rhine Railway (Frankfurt – Mainz – Bingen – Koblenz – Cologne; DB route book no. 471) and is no longer staffed. Tickets can now only be bought from vending machines.\nSankt Goar has landing stages on the Rhine for various companies that run ships on the river, among them the Köln-Düsseldorfer line. The pedestrian and car ferry \"Loreley VI\" links Sankt Goar on the Rhine's left bank with its sister town Sankt Goarshausen over on the right bank. The town's harbour, “Rheinfelshafen”, lies right below the Burg Rheinfels ruin. Since 1994, the harbour has offered a marina for leisure craft of up to 15 m. Another harbour, for yachts, called “Hunt”, is found farther north in the outlying centre of Fellen.\n\nLocated in Sankt Goar is a court of first instance that has within its responsibilities the functions of \"Rheinschifffahrtsgericht\" (a court pertaining to matters involving shipping on the Rhine) and \"Moselschifffahrtsgericht\" (the same again, for the Moselle). In this capacity, the court is directly subordinate to the \"Rheinschifffahrtsobergericht Köln\" or \"Moselschifffahrtsobergericht Köln\", as the case may be. These are both administered through the \"Oberlandesgericht Köln\" (Cologne). Sankt Goar is the seat of a \"Wasserschutzpolizei\" station, which is responsible for the stretch of river between Bacharach and Osterspai (river kilometres 544–575). Furthermore, there is a Sankt Goarshausen–Sankt Goar branch location of the financial office.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1907 and 1915, he served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1918, he was a journalist in Moscow. Later, he worked as a dramaturge or manager of the national theaters in Ljubljana (1920–46, with a two-year break), Osijek, and Belgrade. He died in Ljubljana.\n\nGolia wrote his first collection of poems, titled \"Alkohol\" (\"Alcohol\"), in 1908. It was published only in 1914. He wrote poems for about 40 years. According to the literary historian Igor Grdina, Golia was an intimate poet who wrote about alcoholism, prostitution, and deviant people. Emotions in his poetry are not serious. He was influenced by Oton Župančič, but developed his own form, sometimes closer to artistry.\n\nGolia has been praised for his plays, particularly the ones written for children. He published his first play \"Peterčkove poslednje sanje: božična povest v štirih slikah s prologom\" (\"Peter's Final Dreams: A Christmas Play in Four Images with a Prologue\") in 1923. His most known children plays are \"Princeska in pastirček\" (\"A Princess and a Shepherd Boy\"), \"Jurček\" (\"Little George\"), \"Srce igrač\" (\"The Heart of Toys\"), \"Uboga Ančka\" (\"Poor Little Annie\"), and \"Sneguljčica\" (\"Snow White\"). The expert in Slovenian youth literature Igor Saksida placed him among the best Slovenian children's playwrights.\n\nThe Municipality of Trebnje celebrates 10 April as Pavel Golia Memorial Day.

Since 1975, he has specialised in the subjects of intelligence and security services, defence, policing, civil liberties and, latterly, computer forensics. He was a staff writer at the \"New Statesman\" from 1978–1991 and associate editor (Investigations) from 1988–1991. He was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act in the ABC trial in 1978 and made the controversial series \"Secret Society\" for the BBC in 1987 (see Zircon affair). In 1988, he revealed the existence of the ECHELON surveillance program.\n\nBorn in Glasgow in 1952, Campbell was brought up and educated in Dundee. His mother was a mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park under Alan Turing. As a pupil at the High School of Dundee, an independent school, he first trained in computer programming aged 16, taught computer languages, and undertook programming in scientific computers languages. He gained three 'S' levels (equivalent to 'A' levels) in physics, chemistry, and maths, and then an open scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating in 1973 with a First Class Honours degree in physics. The following year, Campbell completed a one-year MSc in Operational Research at the University of Sussex; the course included psychology, economics, accountancy, and model building. He later told \"The Independent\": \"It was extremely useful. It was not difficult to make the grades, though they'll hate me for saying so\".\n\nAfter leaving Sussex University, Campbell became a journalist on \"Brighton Voice\". Founded in March 1973 by Roy Carr-Hill and George Wilson, the paper's content followed broadly anarcho-socialist principles, with emphasis on reports on housing, the police, gay rights, civil liberties, the environment, unemployment, anti-racism, fascism, and women's rights.\n\nHe was also a regular contributor to \"New Scientist\" and \"Time Out\" magazines, which during the early 1970s had a much more radical editorial remit than they did in later years. In 1976, Campbell wrote a seminal story for \"Time Out\", co-authored with Mark Hosenball, called \"The Eavesdroppers\". It was the first time the British news media printed the acronym GCHQ, which stood for Government Communications Headquarters, a highly secretive arm of the British secret services, responsible for communications interception.\n\nThe article led to the forcible deportation of its American co-author, Hosenball. Campbell, who could not be deported, was instead placed under MI5 surveillance, which included the tapping of his phones. The following year, Campbell agreed to talk with ex-signals intelligence operator, John Berry, at Berry's home. He was accompanied by fellow \"Time Out\" reporter, Crispin Aubrey. After a three-hour conversation, Special Branch arrested the three under the Official Secrets Act 1911, in what became known as the ABC trial.\n\nIn 1982, Campbell published \"War Plan UK — the Truth about Civil Defence in Britain\", which revealed and discussed — often for the first time — the inadequacy and futility of the British government's preparations in the event of nuclear war.\n\nIn 1980, his article revealing the existence of the secret Standing Committee on Pressure Groups (SCOPG) in Hong Kong led to the revelation that most pressure groups and individual members of the Opposition were under surveillance by the colonial government. Campbell's article asserts that Hong Kong under then governor Sir Murray MacLehose had become a dictatorship. In his words: \"Hong Kong is a dictatorship; and scarcely a benevolent one.\"\n\nThe \"Secret Society\" series caused a political furore, known as the Zircon affair, in 1987. The production team behind the series was threatened with prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Campbell's front door was kicked down and his home searched, and Strathclyde Police raided the corporation's Scottish headquarters in Glasgow and seized the tapes from the offices of BBC Scotland, where the series had been made. The tapes were later returned and the series broadcast on the BBC except for episode one. The BBC decided that the first episode, about secret cabinet committees, was too sensitive to show before the 1987 general election. Labour MP Alistair Darling believed that the Thatcher government leaned on the BBC to prevent its damaging allegations from being made public.\n\n\nCampbell revealed in 1988, in an article titled \"Somebody's listening\" and published in \"New Statesman\", the existence of the ECHELON surveillance program.\n\nIn 1999, he wrote a report on communications intelligence entitled \"Interception Capabilities 2000\" for the European Parliament.\n\nIn 2005 and 2007, Campbell investigated and wrote criticisms of the Operation Ore child pornography prosecutions in the UK, which exposed police errors. Additionally, he \"revealed how computer evidence used against 7,272 people in the UK accused of being paedophiles had been founded on falsehoods.\" These articles, \"Operation Ore Exposed\" and \"Sex, Lies and the Missing Videotape\", were both published in \"PC Pro\" magazine.\n\nThe Who's Pete Townshend and Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja were both cleared of charges that they accessed child abuse images through the Landslide site by the investigation detailed by Campbell in \"PC Pro\" magazine. When their credit card charges and IP addresses were traced, both men were found to have accessed sites which had nothing to do with child abuse images.\n\nCampbell is gay, and came out in 1987, and has investigated LGBT issues, including \"bogus Aids and HIV medicines, quack doctors\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2030304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030304", "title": "Nail gun", "text": "Nail gun\n\nA nail gun, nailgun or nailer is a type of tool used to drive nails into wood or some other kind of material. It is usually driven by compressed air (pneumatic), electromagnetism, highly flammable gases such as butane or propane, or, for powder-actuated tools, a small explosive charge. Nail guns have in many ways replaced hammers as tools of choice among builders.\n\nThe nail gun was designed by Morris Pynoos, a civil engineer by training, for his work on Howard Hughes' Hughes H-4 Hercules (known as the Spruce Goose). The wooden fuselage was nailed together and glued, and then the nails were removed.\n\nThe first nail gun used air pressure and was introduced to the market in 1950 to speed the construction of housing floor sheathing and sub-floors. With the original nail gun, the operator used it while standing and could nail 40-60 nails a minute. It had a capacity of 400-600 nails.\n\nNail guns use fasteners mounted in long clips (similar to a stick of staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending on the design of the nailgun. Some full head nail guns, especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped head so the nails can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip head nails are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full Round Head nails and ring shank nails provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation, to be used with nail guns with a drum magazine; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. Nail guns vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.\nThe smallest size of fasteners are normally 23 gauge (0.025 inches in diameter), commonly called \"pin nailers\" and generally having no head. They are used for attaching everything from beadings, mouldings and so forth to furniture all the way up to medium-sized (7 to 8 inch) baseboard, crown molding and casing. Lengths are normally in the range ⅜ to 1¼ in. (10 to 32 mm), although some industrial tool manufacturers supply up to 2 in. (50 mm). The 23 gauge micro pin is rapidly gaining ground as users find that it leaves a much smaller hole than brad nails, thereby eliminating the time normally taken to fill holes and presenting a far better looking finished product.\n\nThe next size up is the 18 gauge (1.02 mm diameter) fixing, often referred to as a \"brad nail\". These fastenings are also used to fix mouldings but can be used in the same way as the smaller 22 to 24 gauge fastenings. Their greater strength leads to their use in trim carpentry on hardwoods where some hole filling is acceptable. Most 18 gauge brads have heads, but some manufacturers offer headless fastenings. Lengths range from ⅝ in to 2 in. (16 mm to 50 mm)\n\nThe next sizes are 16 and 15 gauge (1.63 and 1.83 mm diameter). These are generally referred to as \"finish nails\". They come in lengths between ⅝ and 2½ in. (16 to 64 mm) and are used in the general fixing of much softwood and MDF trim work (such as baseboard/skirtings, architraves, etc.) where the holes will be filled and the work painted afterwards.\n\nThe largest sizes of conventional collated fastenings are the clipped head and full head nails which are used in framing, fencing and other forms of structural and exterior work. These nails generally have a shank diameter of 0.11 to 0.13 in. (2.9 to 3.1 mm) although some manufacturers offer smaller diameter nails as well. General lengths are in the range 2 in to in (50 to 90 mm). Shank styles include plain, ring annular, twisted, etc. and a variety of materials and finishes are offered including plain steel, galvanized steel, sherardised steel, stainless steel, etc. depending on the pull-out resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. required for the given application. These sizes of fastenings are available in stick collated form (often 20° to 21° for full head, 28° to 34° for clipped head) or coil form (for use in pallet/roofing nailers) depending on the application. Full-head nails have greater pull-out resistance than clipped head nails and are mandated by code in many hurricane zones for structural framing.\n\nAnother type of fastening commonly found in construction is the strap fastening which is roughly analogous to the large head clout nail. These are used in conjunction with a strap shot nailer (or positive placement nailer \"UK\") to fix metalwork such as joist hangers, corner plates, strengthening straps, etc. to timber structures. They differ from conventional nailers in that the point of the fastening is not sheathed so it can be exactly positioned before firing the nail gun.\n\nOther specialist nailers are also available which can drive spikes up to 6¼ inches long, fix wood to steel, etc.\n\nA variation on the nail gun is the palm nailer, which is a lightweight handheld pneumatic nailer that straps to the hand. It is convenient for working in tight spaces where a conventional nailer will not fit and is flexible enough to drive either short nails into metal straps or six inch nails into timber. By repeated hammer action (of around 40 hits per second) the fastener is driven into the material by a more constant palm pressure (as opposed to a conventional nailgun which drives the nail against the inertia of the nailgun).\n\nIn the United States, about 42,000 people every year go to emergency rooms with injuries from nail guns, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Forty percent of those injuries occur to consumers. Nail gun injuries tripled between 1991 and 2005. Foot and hand injuries are among the most common. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that treating nail gun wounds costs at least $338 million per year nationally in emergency medical care, rehabilitation, and workers' compensation. Often personnel selling the tools know little about the dangers associated with their use or safety features that can prevent injuries.\n\nInjuries to the fingers, hands, and feet are among the three most common, but there are also injuries that involve other body areas such as arms and legs as well as internal organs. Some of these injuries are serious and some have resulted in death.\n\nAll kinds of nail guns can be dangerous, so safety precautions similar to those for a firearm are usually recommended for their use. For safety, nail guns are designed to be used with the muzzle contacting the target. Unless specifically modified for the purpose, they are not effective as a projectile weapon.\n\nThe most common firing mechanism is the dual-action contact-trip trigger, which requires that the manual trigger and nose contact element both be depressed for a nail to be discharged. The sequential-trip trigger, which is safer, requires the nose contact to be depressed before the manual trigger, rather than simultaneously with the trigger. Approximately 65% to 69% of injuries from contact-trip tools could be prevented through the use of a sequential-trip trigger, according to the CDC.\n\nThere is recoil associated with the discharge of a nail from a nail gun. Contact triggers allow the gun to fire unintended nails if the nose hits the wood surface or a previously placed nail following recoil. Nailers with touch tip (contact) triggers are susceptible to this double firing. According to a 2002 engineering report from the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), the recoil and firing of the second nail occurs well before the trigger can be released. Acute injury rates are twice as high among users of tools with contact triggers.\n\nIn September 2011 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a nail gun safety guide that details practical steps to prevent injuries including use of tools with sequential triggers, training prior to use, and use of appropriate protective equipment such as eye protection. In June 2013, NIOSH released an instructional comic providing information on nail gun hazards and ways to use the device properly.\n\nResearch aimed at reducing nail gun accidents among frame carpenters, among the heaviest users of nail guns, is ongoing.\n\nThis is the most popular type of nail gun. It is powered from a compressed air supply.\nThere are 4 major parts of a pneumatic nail gun\n\nExplosive-powered (\"powder actuated\") nailguns fall into two broad categories:\n\nEither type can, with the right cartridge loads, be very powerful, driving a nail or other fastener into hard concrete, stone, rolled steelwork, etc., with ease.\n\nPowered by a gas (e.g. propane) and air explosion in a small cylinder; the piston pushes the nail directly and there are no rotating parts.\n\nIn one type of electric nailgun, a rotating electric motor gradually compresses a powerful spring and suddenly releases it.\n\nHere a solenoid propels a metal piston, which has a long front rod which propels the nail.\n\nThe solenoid tends to attract the piston or projectile towards the middle of the solenoid. If a series of solenoids is used (which makes the nailgun into a type of coilgun), to get more power, each solenoid must be switched off when the piston has reached the middle of the solenoid. In multi-solenoid coilguns a short burst of power from a big capacitor (one attached to each solenoid) comes at the right time to propel the piston or projectile. For more information see Coilguns for ferromagnetic projectiles.\n\nA pin nailer is a type of nail gun that releases pin-like fasteners. Unlike other nailers, the ‘nail’ used in such items do not have a flat head. They also have a small diameter so they can pretty much disappear into the surface while keeping pieces of wood together.\n\nPin nailers are often used on molding for furniture, cabinets, and interior millwork. They can also work as temporary fasteners for pieces with irregular shapes that are impossible to hold down with a clamp securely.

It is part of the \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw\" (later renamed to \"WWE 2K\") series (the first under the \"SmackDown vs. Raw\" name) and is based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), particularly the WWE brand extension. This game is the sequel to 2003's \"WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain\" and was succeeded in 2005 by \"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006\".\n\nThe game is largely similar to its predecessor, but adds some key features.\n\nSeveral new gameplay features are introduced, including pre-match and in-match mini-games. The pre-match mini-games are randomly chosen before every singles match, Test of strength, Stare down and Shoving match. Several in-game mini-games include the chop battle and a spanking mini-game for female wrestlers in bra and panties matches. The meter mechanic from the chop battles are retained, but the player must perfectly time the button press three consecutive times to win. If the player does so, a cut scene of the two female wrestlers kissing is played.\n\nThe ability to sustain a submission till the count of 5 once a rope break had been reached was also implemented. The game features several arenas that WWE held events at in 2003 and 2004; there are also arenas based on each WWE television show.\n\nAlso added to the game was the Clean/Dirty system, which influenced each wrestlers tactics. Players can choose if the wrestler is clean, dirty or neutral. A clean or dirty wrestler has a meter that can be filled up by performing special clean/dirty actions or moves.\n\n\"WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW\" also includes a redone WWE PPV (Pay-Per-View) mode from its past games where the player can play sample PPVs from 2004, or create a PPV of their own by booking matches choosing match types and any superstar, legend or created superstar in the game. Created Championships could be waged in the created PPVs. Before playing the PPV the game would show a generic highlight reel featuring two of the superstars in the main event of the show. Commentary began to improve and sync up with the matches more.\n\nThe game also featured an all-new Create-a-Championship mode where the player can create and defend the title in their created PPV. The game also includes the Create-A-Wrestler mode from previous games where the created superstars movesets, attributes, entrances, and brand could be customized. The create mode was improved from the previous game. Stables could be created featuring any wrestler game and entrances could be customized.\n\nAn all-new challenge mode provides gamers with opportunities to challenge themselves at different difficulty levels. In addition, several challenges put gamers in memorable matches from the past and beating these challenges will help unlock alternate attires, arenas.\n\nThe game received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe game received a score of 80/100 on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2030315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030315", "title": "Size Isn't Everything", "text": "Size Isn't Everything\n\nSize Isn't Everything is the twentieth studio album by the Bee Gees, released in the UK on 13 September 1993, and the US on 2 November of the same year. The brothers abandoned the contemporary dance feel of the previous album \"High Civilization\" and went for what they would describe as \"A return to our sound before \"Saturday Night Fever\"\".\n\nThe album marked the Bee Gees's return to Polydor Records after their three-album contract with Warner Bros. Records. The album was recorded following a time of considerable strain for the Gibb brothers. Maurice had only recently managed to overcome his long-term struggle with alcoholism and Barry Gibb's wife and prematurely newborn daughter both suffered ill health. Barry himself was also scheduled to have back surgery. Subsequently, on 6 March 1992, the brothers' father, Hugh Gibb, died, the day after the birthday of their late brother Andy, who had died in 1988. The album was dedicated to Hugh. Work on the album began in 1992.\n\nThe first track \"Paying the Price of Love\" has numerous \"alternate mixes\" available in different releases. \"Kiss of Life\" is an energetic rock/dance hybrid with an impressively complex vocal line involving distinctive Robin and Barry's solo vocals as well as the group's vocals. \"Omega Man\" and \"Above and Beyond\" feature lead vocals by Maurice Gibb. On \"Haunted House\", Barry commented in an interview with \"Q\" magazine, \"I guess you could say the song's about divorce\". According to Robin, \"Heart Like Mine\" was inspired by Enya's moody songs, and he gets some of the slow dreamy feel of her music. \"Blue Island\" was dedicated to the children of the former Yugoslavia and according to Barry that the song was the nicest track they had ever written.\n\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" became the biggest hit on \"Size Isn't Everything\". The last track, \"Decadance\" was a new remix of the classic No. 1 hit \"You Should Be Dancing\", which was included only on the European version of the album. The unison scream of the line (\"My baby moves at midnight\") by Barry at 2:20 was first sung to the public back in 1989, towards the end of the One for All Tour in Melbourne.\n\nOn 9 August 1993, the album's first single, \"Paying the Price of Love\", was released in the UK and peaked at No. 23. The album peaked at No. 33 in the UK in late September. It then disappeared from the charts, only to return in December 1993 when the album's second single, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", became a UK top five hit. The album again peaked at No. 23. In all, the album spent sixteen weeks inside the UK Top 100 and was certified gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies. A third single, the ballad \"How to Fall in Love, Part 1\", was released on 4 April 1994 in the UK, peaking at No. 30. This made \"Size Isn't Everything\" the first Bee Gees album to contain three UK top 30 hits since 1979's \"Spirits Having Flown\" and many consider this album their strongest post-disco album.\n\nReaction to the album in the US was less successful, where the album peaked at No. 153 and spent only three weeks inside the whole \"Billboard\" 200. The single \"Paying the Price of Love\" only reached No. 74 in the US during the fall of 1993, presumably because by 1993, The Bee Gees were an adult contemporary group and this single was too heavy for AC stations with its hip-hop influenced percussion. The European hit single, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", bubbled under on \"Billboard\"'s Hot 100 at No. 109.\n\nReception of the album was mixed around the world, though it is notable that it was one of the most successful Bee Gees albums in Argentina, peaking at No. 1 due to the big success of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" there. Worldwide sales of the album are estimated to be over 700,000 copies. According to Barry, when asked on American breakfast shows why the album was called \"Size Isn't Everything\", he explained that the Bee Gees have never been hyped and that they have always had to prove themselves musically, so the title came from that idea.\n\nAll tracks were written and composed by Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb.\n\n"}
{"id": "2030320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030320", "title": "Elaine Tuttle Hansen", "text": "Elaine Tuttle Hansen\n\nElaine Tuttle Hansen is an American academic administrator, scholar and university professor who served as the executive director of the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University from 2011 to 2018 and the 8th President of Bates College from 2002 to 2011.\n\nAfter serving as the Provost of Haverford College from 1995 to 2002, Hansen was installed as the seventh and first female president of Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. Her nine-year tenure as the college's president saw increased financial aid resources, faculty and student diversity, and modernization. Outside of her directorship she serves on the board of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Educational Records Bureau. She is a scholar of Middle English literature, contemporary women’s writing and feminist theory.\n\nShe is a member of the Modern Language Association and served as the president of the Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship. Hansen's feminist research and commentary focuses on modern feminist theory, motherhood socialization, gender roles and gender equity. She has also commented and wrote on the topics of academic administration, professorial ethics, and admission standards in the United States.\n\nHansen graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Mount Holyoke College in 1969. She received her M.A. from the University of Minnesota in 1972 and Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 1975. Hansen served as the Provost of Haverford College from 1995–2002 and was a Professor of English at Haverford from 1980-2002. During this time she also was an Assistant Professor of English at Hamilton College from 1978-1980.\n\nHansen was installed as the seventh and first female president of Bates College on October 26, 2002 in Lewiston, Maine. Amid rising tensions between the Bates community and the city of Lewiston, Hansen released a message to the city outlining the college's impact in its development and historical significance. In a 2003 memo, she noted that the college's operating budget of $65 million, although originating outside of Maine, its expenditure was completely in-state. This accounted for nearly $6 million in direct payments to approximately 360 businesses in the Lewiston and Auburn area, and $1.2 million directly to individuals. She later mentioned that although the college was at the time a tax-exempt organization, she authorized $341,000 in fees for services and taxes to the city. Hansen cited the impact students and faculty have had on the economy of Lewiston ($70 million in direct spending by faculty, students, and visitors per year), as appropriate and meaningful integration into the community.\n\nHansen released an internal memo to the Bates community in late March 2003 regarding the U.S. invasion or Iraq, noting the campus protests and the resolution passed by the student government's representative assembly condemning the armed conflict. After Hurricane Katrina, Hansen waved tuition requirements for all student affected by its impact in late 2005. She later coordinated with the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU) to further financial aid allocation by the college for students in need. In 2005, Hansen taught a Short Term class on Chaucer at Bates.\n\nHansen began the Presidential Symposium program at the college during her first years as president. In 2007, she began the first such symposium entitled, \"College for ‘Coming Time’\" followed by a 2008 symposium entitled, \"Unswerving Values, Changing Times\". A new symposium has been held at the college ever since, eventually transforming into the Mount David Summit. In April 2007, Hansen sent an internal memo to the students of Bates regarding the shooting at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, issuing new security protocols, and restating the current security measures in place at the college. In late 2007, Hansen announced the construction of 280 Hall, a new residence hall for 150 students at the foot of Mount David. In April 2008, expanded the campus of Bates College by completing the construction of \"The Commons\" at a cost of approximately $24 million.\n\nDuring the 2007-08 financial crisis and subsequent recession, Hansen released the meeting notes from the October 2008 Board of Trustees meeting. The notes were anticipated by the students as many feared for the economic stability of the college's endowment (i.e. financial aid). In the note, Hansen outlined the current economic climate as being in a period of \"declining markets, higher costs of borrowing, the potential impact on giving (i.e. fundraising, endowment spending, etc). Hansen mentioned that the college would have to restructure its 10-year financial model in order accommodate its promise to cover \"the demonstrated need of all admitted students.\" She later commented, \"I recognize that these are times of stress and concern for all, but I want you to know that the Trustees and I have every confidence in the strength and perseverance of this institution and the entire Bates community.\"\n\nOn February 5, 2008, she alerted the Bates community about a letter sent to 136 U.S. colleges and universities by the chairman and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus and Charles Grassley. The letter proposed mandatory endowment payments and tuition caps for institutions of higher learning that held at or above $500 million in financial endowments. Although Bates, at the time held only $275 million, many students began to refinance loan packages prompting a memo to be issued by Hansen. She noted that although increased financial regulation is surely in the future for Bates, the college will not dismiss loans from its financial aid packages.\n\nHansen released a memo outlining fiscal year losses due to the 2007-08 financial crisis and subsequent recession, noting a 31% market value loss. She lowered faculty increases but kept them positive during 2009-10. She announced that there will be no salary or hiring freezes, no layoffs, and that the college \"would cover 100% of the increase in health care premiums for families.\" In 2010, Hansen earned $432,000 in salary, benefits and perks.\n\nAt the start of February 2011, Hansen renovated Roger Williams Hall and Hedge Hall as a part of \"Campus Facilities Master Plan\". She released a facilities report later on in the month outlining a \"distributed campus plan\" by extending the walkways into the city of Lewiston.\n\nHansen announced in the academic year 2011 that she would step down as Bates College president. It was announced soon after that the Vice President of Institutional Policy of Harvard University, Clayton Spencer was to be appointed as her successor.\n\nAfter stepping down from the Bates College presidency, Hansen joined the leadership of The Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. On August 1, 2011, she was appointed as the executive director of the university program. On April 6, 2013, Hansen was the inauguration speaker for the incoming president of Berea College, Lyle Roelofs in Berea, Kentucky.\n\nIn July 2013, she was profiled by \"Johns Hopkins Gazette\" where she was asked about the upcoming decade for the program and its priorities. She defined her top priory for the future of The Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University by stating:The evolving role of online learning and hybrid educational programs will serve the needs of the most academically advanced students particularly well. Our increased understanding of how the human brain functions will enhance our ability to identify and nurture the most exceptional minds and improve the educational experiences of all learners.The university announced that she was stepping down in August 2018.\n\nHansen serves on the board of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Educational Records Bureau. She also serves on the Board of Trustees at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She was an associate editor of the Middle English Dictionary at the University of Michigan. Hansen was also a past member and subsequent president of Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship and a member of the Modern Language Association.\n\nHansen is a scholar of Middle English literature, contemporary women’s writing and feminist theory. Hansen identifies herself as a feminist who advances both gender equality and equity. Her stances on motherhood in society revolve around \"conceptual splitting\" or breaking up the concept into multiple areas, akin to inersectionality. She breaks up the notions of motherhood into multiple definitions such as full-time mothers, surrogate mothers, teenage mothers, adoptive mothers, mothers who live in poverty, and \"mothers with briefcases.\" Hansen states: Although it seems clear that new, unprecedented pressures have recently called into question the meaning of \"mother,\" this assumption nonetheless simplifies the history of the term. Motherhood has meant many different things in the past, just as it means (and will no doubt continue to mean) different things in different cultures and subcultures today.\n\nAs an established scholar and academic administrator in U.S. higher education, Hansen has published papers and expressed concern as well as acclaim for the operation of universities, academic standards, and accessibility. Hansen dismissed the theory of \"grit prediction\" put forward by Angela Lee Duckworth in an April 2013 TEDTalk. She dismissed the claim that \"grit\" or \"a combination of passion and perseverance for a singularly important goal,\" was the ultimate predictor of academic success, ahead of a students intelligence quotient (I.Q.), family background, or socioeconomic status. Hansen asserted that if academics and professors burden themselves with \"concerns about failing schools, common core standards and teaching to the test\" and the new theory of \"grit prediction\", they will fail to pursue the true goal of education: providing a quality education for everyone. She has stated that although \"teachers are being directed to educate students to struggle, take risks and persist against adversity,\" they fail to acknowledge those who excel, thus discounting their performance and contributions. Hansen stated that \"in the rush to add grit to the lesson plan, we risk leaping from anecdote to antidote, and making assumptions about the correlation, or not, between effort and intelligence.\" She has made repeated calls for academics and professors to examine those who excel (i.e. those who are outliers) and integrate what they find to improve the aggregated academic experience in the classroom.\n\nBeing prepared for the rigorous of university work is another field Hansen comments on in interviews and articles. In an article for \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", entitled \"Top Students, Too, Aren't Always Ready for College,\" Hansen defined in her words, \"a serious college preparedness problem.\" She noted:Our attitudes and practices send a loud and depressing message about how little we value academic achievement. From kindergarten through college, we must think harder about what we're saying when we focus on test scores, eliminate honors and AP classes, and cut what little financing exists for research on gifted students. Even as experts and pundits talk about the global achievement gap and the importance of creativity and innovation, few ask how we can raise the ceiling for the students already above the floor.Her comments in the article were picked up by National Public Radio (NPR), where Michel Martin criticized her stance on a students road to a university. Martin pointed out that students have been trained from early on that independent achievement is to be valued above all else; to solve this issue is nearly impossible. Hansen clarified that her stance on the issue was opening up the conversation not providing an immediate and definitive answer to the problem.\n\nHansen has commented on the relationship between the liberal arts and the U.S. business sector in letters to the editor, opinion editorials and articles. She has dismissed arguments brought forward by academics issuing that liberal arts colleges tend to disparage and undermine students who wish to participate in fields such as finance, business, and accounting. Author and 27th president of Dickinson College, William G. Durden charged liberal arts leaders with creating an elitist, “separatist” perspective. Hansen rejected this charge citing the \"intellectual and ethical virtues fostered by their undergraduate experience\" as a key to their success. She was quoted as saying:Rather than faulting liberal education for failing to prevent greed and corruption in corporate America, we need to do a better job of communicating what the CEOs who prefer to hire liberal arts graduates already know: Although our expertise rests in academic disciplines and our worth to society has much to do with the intrinsic human need to learn, we have many “practical” programs, and access to the broad learning achieved through a liberal education gives our graduates a realistic understanding of the complexity of the world and prepares them for lives satisfying to themselves and useful to others.Hansen has at times criticized collegiate admission practices stating that although restructuring the admissions platforms most universities use are generally agreed upon, how one is to do this is highly debatable. The shift from de-emphasizing individual performance and achievement, to general “authentically chosen” activities generating “emotional and ethical awareness and skills,\" is, according to Hansen, \"doing more harm than good.\" She refuted a report issued by the Harvard School of Education which asserted that colleges and universities will have a better pool of students should they choose to admit students based on group activities, putting less value on individual contribution. Hansen asserts that implementing admission standards that focus on these metrics \"invites only skepticism and confusion.\" She notes that admission officers can't reasonably deduce whether a student has an appropriate level of gratitude from a supplementary essay. To implement these subjective metrics would mean dramatic changes to the culture and pedagogy of universities. Hansen states that low-income students can't easily find the specific jobs and work experience required of them to fill subjective and speculative metrics. She goes on to state that \"we know too little about how and when to identify, characterize, measure and develop the so-called noncognitive aspects of learning that this report asks colleges to evaluate. And I disagree that the gateway to college is the time or place to subject young people to the full impact of our ignorance about how to fairly assess things they should still be questioning and exploring -- like character, feelings, motives and values.\"\n\nHansen is married to Stanley Hansen, a speech pathologist. They have two children: Emma, a student at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and Isla, a student in Lewiston, Maine.\n\n\nHansen has written literary critical articles, opinion editorials, and reviews as well as three books:\n\n\n\nInstitutional profiles\nNews and publication profiles\n"}

{"id": "2030324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030324", "title": "Ranthambore National Park", "text": "Ranthambore National Park\n\nRanthambhore National Park or Ranthambhore is a national park in northern India, initially covering 282 km² at the time it was formed. Ranthambhore was established as the \"Sawai Madhopur Game Sanctuary\" in 1955 by the Government of India and was declared one of the Project Tiger reserves in 1973. Ranthambhore became a national park on 1 November 1980. In 1984, the adjacent forests were declared the \"Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary\" and \"Keladevi Sanctuary\". In 1992, the Tiger Reserve was expanded to include the adjoining Keladevi Sanctuary in the north and Sawai Mansingh sanctuary to the south along with other forests *. Today it covers an area of 1334 sq. km.\n\nRanthambhore wildlife sanctuary is known for its Bengal tigers, and is a popular place in India to see these animals in their natural jungle habitat. Tigers can be easily spotted even in the daytime. The best times for tiger sightings at Ranthambhore National Park are deemed to be in November and May. The park's deciduous forests are characteristic examples of the type of jungle found in Central India. Other fauna include the Indian leopard, nilgai, wild boar, sambar, striped hyena, sloth bear, southern plains gray langur, rhesus macaque, mugger crocodile and chital. The sanctuary is home to a wide variety of trees, plants, birds and reptiles, as well as one of the largest banyan trees in India.\n\nIt is situated in the Sawai Madhopur district of southeastern Rajasthan, about 110 km northeast of Kota and 140 km southeast of Jaipur, which is also the nearest airport. The nearest town and railway station is at Sawai Madhopur, about 11 km away. The park is also close to the Kota railway station. RIDCOR operates a mega-highway between Kota and Ranthambhore. Ranthambore National Park lies at the edge of a plateau and is bounded to the north by the Banas River and to the south by the Chambal River. It is named after the historic Ranthambore fortress, which lies within the park.\n\nRanthambore is known for its large tiger population. As park tourism and the population of neighbouring villages increased, there were more frequent fatal human-tiger interactions and poaching. The Indian government started Project Tiger in 1973 and allotted an area of 60 mi of the park as a tiger sanctuary. This area later expanded to become what is now the Ranthambhore National Park.\n\nIn 2005, there were 26 tigers living in the park. This was significantly lower than the recorded tiger population of the reserve in 1982, which stood at 44. According to non-government sources there were 34 adult tigers in the Ranthambhore National Park in 2008, and more than 14 cubs. This increase was attributed largely to sustained efforts by forest officials to curb poaching. Villagers in the region were being given incentives to stay out of the park, and surveillance cameras were also fitted across the reserve. The Indian government committed US$153 million for these efforts. They were successful enough to make Ranthambhore eligible to participate in the Sariska Tiger Reserve relocation program. The first aerial relocation, of the male tiger (Dara) from Ranthambhore to Sariska, was done on 28 June 2008 by Wing Commander Vimal Raj, using a Mi-17 helicopter. Unfortunately, this translocated tiger died on 15 November 2010 due to poisoning.\n\nDuring the past few years, there has been a decline in the tiger population in Ranthambhore due to poaching and other reasons.\n\nA tigress known as \"The Lady of the Lakes\" was separated from her parents at a very young age because of poaching. The young tigress was named Machli after the mark on her body that resembles a fish. She gave birth to three female cubs, one being dubbed 'Machli - The Junior'. The father of Machli Jr. died early from an unknown disease, as confirmed by forest officer Fateh Singh Rathore. Machli Jr. mated with the male tiger Bumburam and gave birth to two cubs, Slant Ear and Broken Tail. Baccha is believed to be her grandson. Machli recently went missing, raising concern among forest officials, as hunting is difficult at her age. After twenty-six days Machli was spotted and located by forest officials.At 20 years old, Machli Sr. was the world's oldest living tigress and she died in August 2016. She was the most famous tigress in the world holding the title of the most photographed tigress in the world. She was single handedly instrumental in increasing the flow of tourists from all over the world to Ranthambore National Park. Machli's daughter T19 (Krishna or Unis) is the current queen tigress of Ranthambhore. In 2014, she gave birth to four cubs fathered by Star or Zalim (she was seen mating with both of them), with three surviving, these cubs are now known as T-84, T-83 and T-85. She became the longest living tigress in wild environment recorded till date.\nAnother popular tigress from Ranthambhore is tigress T39, also known as Mala or Noor. Her name comes from the decorative bead-like stripes on her body. She was born to tigress T-13 and fathered by T-12. In November 2016, she was seen with her fourth litter of two cubs. Noor is 9 years old and her son, T72, or Sultan, is from her first litter and is approximately six years old.\n\nBroken Tail was given international publicity in a film made about his life. He left the park area and traveled from Ranthambore to Darra, where he was killed by a train while crossing the railway tracks. The documentary film called \"Broken Tail\" features his last journey and has been shown worldwide on many TV channels, including BBC, PBS, CBC, and RTÉ among others, and won the top awards at two of the world's most prestigious wildlife film festivals.\n\nT - 25 also known as Dollar male or Zalim is another famous tiger in Ranthambhore, he sent observers and tiger researchers in a tizzy when he fathered his 2 female cubs as their mother died of a disease, this two cubs are now known as Bina 1 and Bina 2 and both were relocated to Sariska in November 2012 when they were 2 years old . Till this incident, all facts on record stated that male tigers do not play an active part in rearing their cubs.\n\nAccording to the 2014 census of tigers, there were 62 tigers in Ranthambhore National Park. The number of tigers was 48 in 2013 and 25 in 2005. Due to the recent increase in the number of tigers, the park is planning to transfer a few to other parks, such as Sariska and others.\n\nForests: The Park terrain alternates between dry deciduous forests and open grassy meadow. The flora of the park includes 539 species of flowering plants.\n\nTigers: Which can be spotted ambling or basking under the sun.\n\nSafari Rides: Rides are carried out at 6:30 and 14:30. Each ride lasts for about three hours. There are two options of vehicles for the safari: 20 seater open top canter or 6 seater open top gypsy. Each ride costs around INR 900 - 1400 per person For Indian Nationality and INR 2000 - 2500 For Foreigner Nationals. The core park area has been divided into several zones and the safari vehicles go to one of those zones. Visitors often take multiple tours, as tiger spotting is rare. There are many resorts to stay in on the way from Sawai Madhopur to the national park.\n\nRanthambore Fort: The majestic fort, built in the 10th century, towers over the entire park area. It stands 700 feet above the surrounding plain. Inside the fort, there are three red Karauli stone temples devoted to Ganesh, Shiva and Ramlalaji. There is a Digamber Jain temple of Lord Sumatinath (5th Jain Tirthankar) and Lord Sambhavanath. The temples were constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nPadam Talao: This is the largest of the many lakes located in the park. A red sandstone Jogi Mahal can be found at the edge of the lake. A gigantic Banyan tree, considered to be India's second largest, is also near the lake.\n\nAir: Jaipur, 160 km away, is the nearest airport to Ranthambhore wildlife sanctuary.\n\nRail: Ranthambhore National Park is around 11 km from Sawai Madhopur Railway Station, which lies on the Delhi to Mumbai trunk route. The city is a stop for many trains, including Jaipur - Indore Super Fast, Dayodaya Express (Ajmer - Jabalpur Express), Jodhpur - Indore Intercity, Hazrat Nizamuddin - Indore Express, Marusagar Express (Ajmer - Ernakulam Express / Ernakulam Express), Jaipur - Mysore Express, Jaipur - Chennai Express, Jaipur - Coimbatore Express, Jodhpur - Puri Express, Jodhpur - Bhopal Express, Jodhpur - Indore Intercity, and the August Kranti Delhi to Mumbai Rajdhani Express.\n\nThe Jaipur - Indore Super Fast connects Sawai Madhopur to a major city of Madhya Pradesh, Indore Junction. There is also a Kota Jan Shatabdi Express train, from Kota to the national capital of Delhi via Sawai Madhopur.

He served as interim Prime Minister from the death of Richard Seddon to the return from overseas of Joseph Ward. Hall-Jones was a mild mannered man with a fully earned reputation as an outstanding administrator. Seddon famously said of him, \"He is the best administrator I have in my Cabinet\".\n\nFrom 1908 to 1912 Hall-Jones served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.\n\nHall-Jones was born in Folkestone, Kent, England, landed at Dunedin in 1873 and became a carpenter and later a builder in Timaru. He developed an interest in local politics serving on the Timaru Borough Council from 1884 to 1886, and again from 1890 to 1892.\n\nThe death of Richard Turnbull triggered a by-election in the Timaru electorate, which was won by Hall-Jones on 18 August 1890. Hall-Jones had initially refused nomination from locals, citing several upcoming business contracts. However, after persistent calls, Hall-Jones reluctantly accepted despite having no parliamentary ambitions. He represented Timaru in the House of Representatives until his resignation in October 1908.\n\nHall-Jones proved an independent thinker. He was initially an Independent Liberal holding moderate, progressive views that tended to align him with John Ballance, Sir George Grey and John McKenzie. He joined the Liberal caucus and in 1891 became the party whip alongside Westby Perceval.\n\nHall-Jones became a cabinet minister in March 1896 given the Public Works portfolio by Prime Minister Richard Seddon following William Pember Reeves resignation to become Agent General for New Zealand in the United Kingdom. His main task in this role was improving the main trunk rail line between Auckland and Wellington. Rejecting a proposal for another incline on the Rimutaka ranges he insisted on using a better route, resulting in the Raurimu spiral. He was also responsible for the eventual construction of the Otira tunnel, going through Arthur's Pass.\n\nSeveral weeks after entering cabinet Hall-Jones was also appointed Minister of Marine, which he was to hold for over a decade. Hall-Jones was also responsible for passing a bill granting protection to famous navigation dolphin Pelorus Jack by Order in Council under the Sea Fisheries Act on 26 September 1904.\n\nHall-Jones was acting Prime Minister during the absence from the country of Seddon in 1906 and formed an administration immediately after Seddon's funeral. During his brief period as Prime Minister, he was Colonial Treasurer, Minister of Labour, Minister of Education, Minister for Public Works, and Minister of Marine.\n\nHowever, Hall-Jones announced that he would only hold power until Sir Joseph Ward's return from abroad. Despite this, there was much speculation in the media that he may attempt to remain in office as Seddon himself had done in 1893.\n\nHall-Jones accepted the Railways and Public Works portfolios in the subsequent Ward administration. Later, he succeeded William Pember Reeves as High Commissioner for New Zealand in London in December 1908, returned to New Zealand at the end of his term in 1912, and was appointed to the Legislative Council by Massey.\n\nHall-Jones died at his home in Wellington on 19 June 1936.\n\n\n\n"}

Frederick junior undertook a legal education and became a solicitor and attorney at the age of 27. A year later he sailed to Australia and then New Zealand. He married Jane Augusta Griffith, stepdaughter of Alexander Shepherd (Colonial Treasurer) at St. Paul's Church in Auckland on 4 March 1843.\n\nWhitaker lived in Auckland and was appointed a County Court judge until this position was abolished in 1844, at which time he returned to work as a lawyer. He was appointed to the General Legislative Council on 3 March 1845 until 22 December of that year. He was then appointed to the Legislative Council of New Ulster Province, but that Council had not met when the new Constitution arrived. He transferred to the new Legislative Council on 26 May 1853 and remained a member until his resignation on 19 December 1864. He was again appointed on 8 October 1879 and remained a member until his death 12 years later. He also served as a major in the militia.\n\nHe was elected onto the Auckland Provincial Council on 19 October 1854 for the Suburbs of Auckland electorate, and he served until 25 September 1855. He was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council from 14 March 1854 to 22 January 1855 and was the provincial law officer.\n\nWhitaker became the first Attorney-General of New Zealand in the Sewell Ministry led by Henry Sewell in 1856. He did not serve as Attorney-General in the subsequent Fox Ministry that was in power for a fortnight, but was again appointed to this position in the Stafford Ministry from 2 June 1856 onwards. He served as Attorney-General until the defeat of the Stafford Ministry on 12 July 1861 and went back to the law. In October 1863 Whitaker was called upon to form a government to replace Premier Domett following his defeat at a vote of no-confidence.\n\nWhitaker's term as Premier lasted just over a year until November 1864. His term ended due to differences between himself and Governor Grey over the conduct of the New Zealand Wars. Whitaker also resigned as a member of the Legislative Council. He served briefly as the member of Parliament for Parnell from 1866 to 1867.\n\nIn October 1865 he was elected Superintendent of Auckland Province, which office he held until 1867. Then for nine years he stayed away from public office.\n\nIn 1876 he became MP for Waikato and later Attorney-General again in Atkinson's government; the Atkinson Ministry lasted until October 1877. Whitaker lost his seat in the House in 1879, when he was defeated for Eden. However, when Premier Hall wanted him to serve as Attorney-General again, he was appointed once more to the Legislative Council in 1879. When Hall resigned in April 1882, Whitaker became Premier for the second time, serving until September 1883.\n\nWhitaker was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1884 and served again as Attorney-General, and as leader of the Legislative Council from 1887 to 1890. By then his health was failing, and he died in Auckland on 4 December 1891. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell.\n\n"}

Greek writer Margarita Lymberaki adapted Euripides' \"Hippolytus\" into a melodrama concerning the rich society of ship owners and their families, but still containing some of the tragic elements of the ancient drama. The film is set in Paris, London, and the Greek island of Hydra.\n\nPhaedra, second wife of shipping tycoon Thanos (Raf Vallone), falls in love with her husband's son from his first marriage, Alexis (Anthony Perkins).

Four years later he moved to Adelaide and set up business as a merchant.\n\nHe was first elected to parliament in the electoral district of East Torrens in August 1851. He resigned 3 years later, was elected again in 1857 but resigned again soon after. \n\nHe supported economic development of the colony through free trade and was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council again in 1860, where he advocated uniform tariffs for Australia. He was chief secretary in the First Reynolds Ministry from May 1860 to February 1861. After Reynolds ended his term as Premier in 1861, Waterhouse formed a government with the intention of finalising a motion in relation to Justice Benjamin Boothby, a judge in the Supreme Court of South Australia who was causing difficulties by objecting to the legitimacy of the Appeals Court under the new Constitution. Waterhouse resigned his ministry after this task was completed, but was persuaded to reform another government, which lasted until July 1863 before collapsing in the face of accusations of financial irregularities and alleged misappropriation of funds. In 1864 he retired from South Australian politics and spent some time in England.\n\nWaterhouse migrated to New Zealand in 1869 and on 13 May 1870 was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council. He was in the Fox Ministry from 30 October to 20 November 1871, and in October 1872 became premier without portfolio. He resigned in March 1873 finding that as a member of the upper house it was impossible to keep control of his ministry. He remained a Legislative Council member until his resignation on 30 June 1890.\n\nWaterhouse fell into ill-health and retired to England in 1889, and died at Torquay, Devonshire on 6 August 1906.\n\nWaterhouse had his career both in Australia and New Zealand, but it was much hampered by the poor state of his health. He has the unusual distinction of having been the premier of two colonies. Despite this distinction, Waterhouse never received a knighthood or a peerage for his services in governing two colonies.\n\nHe married Lydia Giles (1827 – 25 January 1910), a daughter of William Giles, on 5 July 1848.

Little is known about the early part of his life, but it is supposed that he grew up in Ireland and in the United States of America. However, his father was dock master of the Grand Canal Company at Ringsend in 1812, still held that office in 1832, and died in 1837 to be succeeded as dock master by Thomas Pollen. On some accounts, Pollen's father helped to build the United States Capitol.\n\nA doctor, Pollen claimed to hold the MD degree, although where he graduated is not recorded. He travelled to New South Wales in the late 1830s, and moved to North Auckland in January 1840. He was a witness to the proceedings of the Treaty of Waitangi. He began his practice as a doctor in Parnell, Auckland, in 1841. In 1844 he was appointed as a coroner and held this post for four years.\n\nOn 18 May 1846, Pollen married Jane Henderson, the daughter of an officer of the Royal Navy (Lieutenant Essex, RN, of Demarara). He moved with her to Kawau Island in 1847, after becoming medical officer to a Scottish copper-mining company.\n\nPollen spent several years on Kawau, during which time he began to contribute articles to \"The New Zealander\" supporting the agitation for responsible government. He was also to the fore in supporting temperance, scientific, and library movements there.\n\nWhen the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 became law, Pollen was made chief clerk in the Auckland Superintendent's office.

The remains of the fort lie under the 14th-century house of Cefn Caer, overlooking the village.\n\nJust outside Pennal is the farmstead of 'Esgair Weddan' which from the 14th century until the mid 18th was the home of the Price (ap Rhys) family of Esgair Weddan, patrilineal descendants of Dafydd ap Llywelyn, son of Llywelyn fawr (the great) Prince of Wales (1240–1246). Their home was called Plas yn y Rofft in Elizabethan times and was located in a field behind the present farmhouse above the village of Cwrt, (originally Pont y Cwrt), meaning \"court\", near to Mynydd Esgairweddan.\n\nPennal is known for its historical association with Owain Glyndŵr. In Pennal Owain composed the famous Pennal Letter of 1406, a letter to the King of France setting out his plans for an independent Wales – the only document which stands as a policy document for an independent Wales in the Middle Ages. The letter was briefly returned to Wales from France for an exhibition at the National Library of Wales in 2000, and a campaign has started for it to be returned permanently to Wales and be put on show at the National Assembly building in Cardiff.\n\nJust outside Pennal, on the banks of the Dyfi opposite the hamlet of Morben, is \"Llugwy\", the home of the Anwyl family since 1682. This family have patrilinear descent from Rhodri Mawr through Anarawd, his eldest son, and Owain Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd c.1137 – 1170) to the present day.\n\nIn the early 19th century there were quays on the Dyfi where slate from the quarries around Corris, Aberllefenni and Abergynolwyn was brought by packhorse for loading onto seagoing vessels. This trade died out when the Corris Railway to Machynlleth and the Talyllyn Railway to Tywyn were built. The Cwm Ebol quarry operated a mile north west of the village between 1868 and around 1906. A gauge tramway (later converted to gauge) operated between the quarry and the village. Between 1918 and 1920 part of the tramway was reused in another gauge railway, serving timber felling operations at Cwm Dwr, two miles north of the village.\n\nThe village also has a place in music history, as it was at nearby Bron-Yr-Aur cottage that Robert Plant was living when he wrote the Led Zeppelin classic, \"Stairway to Heaven\".\n\n"}

It is one of the most endangered primate species of India. Long considered sacred by many Himalayan people, the golden langur was first brought to the attention of the western world by the naturalist E. P. Gee in the 1950s. In a part of Bhutan, it has hybridised with the capped langur \"T. pileatus\".\n\nThe earliest record of the golden langur is in Pemberton's 1838 paper which states that \"Griffith observed these monkeys near Tongso in Central Bhutan.\" However, Pemberton's work was lost and not rediscovered until the 1970s, the scientific discovery of the golden langur unfolded differently. In 1907, E. O. Shebbeare—who was out with some hunters and forest rangers—reported seeing a \"cream coloured langur\" in the vicinity of the Jamduar. However, neither a photograph nor a live or dead specimen was presented at that time. The first reference to the golden langur in print, as an animal of unidentified taxonomic status, was in a 1919 publication that stated: \"\"Pithecus\" sp? – A pale yellow coloured langur is common in the adjoining district of Goalpara (Assam). Jerdon reported one from Terai, the adjacent district on the (west) side, which Blanford suggested might be \"P. entellus\".\"\n\nAt around the time of India's independence in 1947 a number of other sightings were reported. In February 1947, in the Forest Rest House visitor's book in Raimona, a few miles south of Jamduar, C. G. Baron reported seeing some langurs whose \"whole body and tail is one colour – a light silvery-gold, somewhat like the hair of a blonde.\" A year later, back in Jamduar, H. E. Tyndale, a tea planter, reported seeing \"Sankosh cream langurs.\" However, it wasn't until a few years later that a focused effort to identify the golden langur was mounted by E. P. Gee, who traveled to Jamduar in November 1953. His team were able to observe three groups of golden langurs, all on the east bank of the Sankosh river. The first group was observed on the Bhutan side of the border; the second group, a large one of 30 to 40 individuals, a mile north of Jamduar on the Indian side; and a third group four to five miles (6.44 km to 8.05 km) south near Raimona. Colour movies of the second group were made by Gee.\n\nIn August 1954, Gee reported his findings to an expert at the Zoological Society of London, who advised that the golden langur might be a new species. In January 1955, Gee also reported his results to the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) and, after showing his movies of the golden langurs, suggested that Jamduar be included in the then-upcoming ZSI-survey of that region. The suggestion received the support of Dr. Sunder Lal Hora, then Director of ZSI, and later that year six specimens of the golden langur were collected by the survey party. The following year, Dr. H. Khajuria, a taxonomist who studied the specimens, described the new species naming it \"Presbystis geei\" in honour of Gee.\n\nThere are two subspecies of this species:\n\nThe coat of the adult golden langur ranges from cream to golden; on its flanks and chest the hairs are darker and often rust coloured; the coats of the juveniles and females are lighter, silvery white to light buff. The golden langur has a black face and a very long tail measuring up to in length. It has been noted that their fur changes colors according to the seasons.\n\nThe regions of its distribution are very small; the main region is limited to an area approximately 60 miles square bounded on the south by the Brahmaputra River, on the east by the Manas River, on the west by the Sankosh River, all in Assam, India, and on the north by the Black Mountains of Bhutan, and the secondary region, 200 miles to the south-southeast, is in a small portion of the northwestern part of Tripura state. These biogeographical barriers are believed to have led to the radiation of species from the closely related capped langur (\"Trachypithecus pileatus\"). The best range maps so far are Choudhury (2002) and Choudhury (2008)\n\nFor the most part, the langur is confined to high trees where its long tail serves as a balancer when it leaps across branches. During the rainy season it obtains water from dew and rain drenched leaves. Its diet is herbivorous, consisting of ripe and unripe fruits, mature and young leaves, seeds, buds and flowers.\n\nIt generally lives in troops of about 8 (but sometimes up to 50) with a ratio of several females to each adult male. The smallest golden langur troop was composed of four individuals, while the largest had 22, giving an average value of 8.2 individuals per troop. The adult gender ratio was 2.3 females to every male, although the majority of groups had only one adult male.\n\nThey are listed in Appendix I of CITES and Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (Indian law). Gee's golden langur is currently endangered with the current population trend as decreasing; its total Indian population is 1500 individuals. Bhutan has 4000 individuals. 93% of the population is found in contiguous forest, while the remaining 7% is found in several small isolated reserves. The population has declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years, and is expected to decline further in the near future. The scattering of golden langurs in small groups is not a good sign. The primate needs to be concentrated in viable areas.\n\nOn 5 June 2019, the district authorities of Bongaigaon district in Assam launched a project under the MGNREGA to plant guava, mango, blackberry and other fruit trees to ensure that the resident golden langurs of the Kakoijana reserved forest do not have to risk their lives to find food. Several golden langurs have died due to electrocution and in road accidents while looking for food beyond the reserve forests.\n\nIn 1988, two captive groups of golden langurs were released into two protected areas of the western region of the state of Tripura, India. As of 2000, one of these groups, consisting of six (and possibly eight) individuals in the Sepahijala Wildlife Sanctuary, had survived.\n\nThe relative death of infants and juveniles indicate a declining population with the habitat being degraded by human activity. A fragmented but protected population in a rubber plantation in the Nayakgaon, Kokrajhar, district of Assam increased in population from 38 individuals in 1997 to 52 in 2002. The population has also adapted to feeding on dry rubber seeds.\n\n\n"}

It lies in the Royal Forest of Dean, on the west bank of the River Severn, approximately 10 miles south-west of Gloucester and three miles southeast of Cinderford. It is on the A48 road between Gloucester and Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales. The village has a parish council.\n\nA parish church was established in the 14th century (although there had been a chapel of ease since 1018), and in 1366 a new church building was built on the high ground of the village as the old one faced erosion from the river. The new building has itself been damaged by a gunpowder explosion in 1644 during the English Civil War and a fire in 1881, but is still in use.\n\nBecause of Newnham's location on the Severn, the Ancient Romans built three roads through the location, where they forded the river. The Anglo-Saxons established a permanent settlement, the Normans built a motte-and-bailey fortification for defence, and in medieval times it became a major port with links around Great Britain and Ireland. In 1171, Henry II of England staged an invasion of Ireland from Newnham. One account claimed that he set sail with 400 ships and 5,000 men, which suggests its importance as a port. For a time Newnham was the most successful Gloucestershire town west of the Severn. Its role as a port and trading hub declined, however, rapidly with the 1827 opening of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.\n\nIn 1810, an early attempt at a Severn tunnel began construction just south of Newnham. Work was abandoned after flooding in 1812.\n\nMatron Eva Luckes of The London Hospital lived in Newnham.\n\nThe scenic Gloucester to Newport Line goes through the tunnel here. Newnham railway station opened in 1851 and closed in 1964.\n\nThe civil parish is part of Newnham and Westbury electoral ward. This ward starts in the north at Westbury-on-Severn and then follows the River Severn to Newnham. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 3,088.\n\n"}

It is similar in concept and may in some cases have replaced the football widow, which in the UK is often replaced by the \"golf widow\". The term was in use as early as 1983, with use of bulletin board systems and programming a concern. The possible problems created in family life were being studied by psychologists, with couples coming to them for help. It was commented upon by Phillip Zimbardo as a possible problem which may develop as a result of children growing up around computers, who then may fail to have social skills in later life. He said that there was a risk that it would lead to greater separation between the sexes, because at the time, perhaps more so than today, computers were used by men more than women. However, some people find the Internet a way to meet a partner, such as via online dating sites.\n\nMost gamer widows (partners of those addicted to games) may now be attached to players of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). Because many of these games revolve around building or \"leveling up\" a player character, many hours are dedicated to this process while playing the game. Examples of MMORPGs include \"EverQuest\", \"RuneScape\", \"World of Warcraft\", \"Guild Wars\", \"Ultima Online\", \"Final Fantasy XI\", \"City of Heroes\", and \"Ragnarok Online\". Other games such as \"Counter-Strike\", the games of the \"Call of Duty\" series that have online multiplayer options, \"StarCraft\" and \"Civilization III\" or \"IV\", often known for their addictive qualities, also result in their fair share of gamer widows.\n\nSome support groups for computer widows exist in real life. Internet support groups exist for addicted players of the popular MMORPGs, \"EverQuest\" and \"World of Warcraft\", with some gamers speaking in the media of their need for such a group.\nThere are also Internet support groups for \"World of Warcraft\" widows.\nA website was launched in mid-2005, dedicated to the support of gamer widow(er)s of a variety of different games, including \"World of Warcraft\" and \"EverQuest\". It was the first site of its kind that provided support forums for gamer widow(er)s and has gained international recognition after the founder, Sherry Myrow, was interviewed by MSNBC FoxBusiness and by \"Maclean's\".\nMerchandise can even be purchased on the Internet with slogans admitting that a person is a widow to some of these computer activities. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2030385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030385", "title": "Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest", "text": "Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest\n\nBernheim Arboretum and Research Forest is a 15,625 acre (57 km) arboretum, forest, and nature preserve located in Clermont, Kentucky (25 miles south of Louisville, Kentucky, United States).\n\nBernheim was founded in 1929 by Isaac Wolfe Bernheim, a German immigrant and successful brewer whose whiskey distillery business established the I.W. Harper brand. He purchased the land in 1928 at $1 an acre because most of it had been stripped for mining iron ore. The Frederick Law Olmsted landscape architecture firm started work on designing the park in 1931 and it opened in 1950. Bernheim Forest was given to the people of Kentucky in trust and is the largest privately owned natural area in the state. Bernheim, his wife, daughter, and son-in-law are buried in the forest.\n\nIn 1988, at least one outside consulting firm was engaged and work on a new long-range plan for the forest was begun. One of the directives of the new strategic plan was to make the arboretum a primary focus. In addition, the forest decided to strengthen its research ties with institutions such as the University of Louisville. As a result, Bernheim Forest was renamed Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest. However, most local visitors still refer to the property as \"Bernheim Forest,\" and some of the signage located along surrounding roads still refer to the old name. In recent years, Bernheim has developed a strong volunteer program, added frequent public workshops and classes, and successfully hosts several large public events each year. These include the annual ColorFest in October, Bloomfest in May, CONNECT, an evening in August where art, science and nature converge in unexpected and funky ways, and a 5-mile (8 km) run/walk, held in October.\n\nGenerally speaking, the property is divided into two areas—the arboretum and the natural area. The arboretum features formal and informal plant collections and various modern facilities, including handicapped accessible restrooms. Other arboretum features include numerous walking paths; a visitors' center, cafe, and gift shop; education center; a newly renovated children's play area and an inter-generational shelter, The Grisby Shelter, and four lakes. The natural area contains most of Bernheim's hiking trails, and is primarily a beech-maple forest with access via paved roads. There are over 35 miles (56.3 km) of hiking trails and scenic fire-roads, including the 13.3 mile (21.4 km) Millennium Trail and the 3.2 mile (5.1 km) paved Hike-Bike Pike. One short trail, the aptly named Fire Tower Loop, leads to a metal observation tower that is often open to climb via stairs. There is also a canopy walk which extends off a cliff and places the viewer above the trees and sharing a wonderful vista. Hiking trails range in difficulty from \"casual\" short walks to strenuous jaunts designed for \"the more serious hiker,\" per Bernheim's website. The Millennium Trail is by far the longest and most challenging; as a result Bernheim asks that hikers set out before certain times in the morning (the deadline varies by season), as well as register at the visitor's center prior to starting the hike. In 2005, a hiker died of a heat stroke while attempting to complete the Millennium Trail.\n\nBernheim is open daily from 7 a.m. until sunset, the exceptions being Christmas day (December 25) and New Year's Day (January 1). The visitor's center, gift shop, and art gallery are open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Activities one can engage in at Bernheim include walking, running, hiking, picnicking, birdwatching, bicycling, plant identification, photography, fishing, and special events. Although overnight camping was once allowed in a designated campground, it is no longer permitted. Bernheim is dog friendly (dogs must remain on a leash at all times, and are prohibited in certain areas).\n\nThe education center offers programs for school and other groups (advanced reservations are required). In 2005, a new visitor's center was opened and is considered to be a revolutionary eco-friendly design. Designed by the architecture firm William McDonough + Partners, the center is constructed of recycled materials and has live plantings on the roof. The parking lot for the center was specifically located so that mushrooms could absorb contaminants that cars emit so they would not affect the water streams nearby. Glass and garden spaces are integrated into the design scheme. The building was awarded the Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum rating.\n\nBernheim offers memberships that include free year-round admission, discounts on educational programs, in the shop and subscription to a quarterly newsletter. For non-members, admission is free on weekdays, but a fee is charged on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays ($5 for each passenger car, mini-van, or motorcycle; $10 for passenger vans and recreational vehicles; and $20 for buses).\n\nBefore his death, Bernheim laid out his goals for the forest in a letter to the trustees and directors of the I. W. Bernheim Foundation. That letter, dated August 30, 1939, set the following goals:\n\nBernheim was a true visionary, and he himself wrote that \"nothing is static in this world.\" He understood the changing nature of the world, and the need for changing thought in the context of time. A wildlife museum such as was described by Bernheim did at once exist, but has been re-arranged in recent years to serve as an administrative/education center, and static wildlife exhibits have mostly been removed (in the forest's defense, many of the taxidermied exhibits were deteriorating). A large area of the Great Meadow contains native long grass and a very successful quail program has been established to repopulate the region with quail. There is an emission offset fee of $5.00 per car has been established on weekends, which some argue is contrary to the vision that \"no distinction will be shown between rich or poor\" and that the forest \"will be kept for ever free.\" Bernheim remains accessible to all.\n\nBernheim had a vision that art can heighten and expand experiences in nature. There are fifteen sculptures located throughout the arboretum, an active Artist in Residence Program and a program called Sited@Bernheim, which supports site-specific installations and sculpture. The Artist in Residence program typically offers housing and a stipend to artists who work in ways that are in keeping with the aspects of Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest's mission of \"connecting people with nature.\" Artists interact with the public in workshops, demonstrations or other activities as well as sharing finished pieces found throughout the arboretum. Past artists have worked in photography, painting, sculpture, video, performance, and the written word. Temporary and permanent sculptures are located throughout the arboretum.\n\nBernheim wrote in his 1939 letter that \"the grave has no voice.\" But, he went on to say \"may I not express the hope and fervent prayer that my wishes outlined in its different sections be respected as much as humanly possible.\" In his 1929 autobiography, \"The Closing Chapters of a Busy Life,\" Bernheim also wrote that \"I am comforted in the firm belief that the good a man does lives after him.\"\n\nThe property includes a 240-acre (0.97 km) arboretum containing over 1,900 labeled species and cultivars of trees, shrubs, and other plants. The arboretum includes over 185 cultivars of American holly species. Other major collections include maples, crab apples, conifers (including dwarf conifers), oaks, buckeyes, ginkgoes, ornamental pears, and dogwoods. Specific attractions within the arboretum include the sun and shade trail, quiet garden, and garden pavilion. The original design for the arboretum was adopted in 1935, and has continued to be refined and improved over the years. In 1994, legislation was passed designating Bernheim as Kentucky's official arboretum. As is the case in most arboreta, the collection of leaves or clippings is not permitted.\n\nThe arboretum's holly collection is among the best in North America. It is officially named the Buddy Hubbuch Holly Collection, after Clarence E. \"Buddy\" Hubbuch, Jr. (deceased as of 2000), Bernheim's first horticulture director who oversaw the planting of the collection over his 33-year tenure (1962 to 1995). It contains more than 700 specimens representing more than 350 individual species and cultivars from all across the northern hemisphere. These include 176 American Holly (\"Ilex opaca\") cultivars, 44 selections of Japanese Holly (\"I. crenata\"), more than 50 cultivars of deciduous hollies (\"I. decidua\", \"I. verticillata\", \"I. serrata\", and hybrids), and 19 cultivars of Inkberry (\"I. glabra\") along with many unique hybrids.\n\nThe design of the landscape and buildings at Bernheim, as well as the sculpture and art found throughout the arboretum, enhance our relationship with the natural environment and inspires the exploration of our deep connection with nature.\n\nThe world-renowned firm of Fredrick Law Olmstead was selected and commissioned in 1931 to design the arboretum. In accordance with the firm's recommendations; roadways, paths and natural areas were created, trees were planted, and farmland was restored to meadows, lawns and forest. Lakes, rivers and ponds were developed to provide \"an enlivening effect.\" In 1950 Bernheim Forest was opened to the public. Continuous efforts are made to enhance the arboretum, the gardens and the natural areas by Bernheim's professional horticulture and natural areas departments.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the gardens surrounding the Garden Pavilion and adjacent Quiet Garden were developed by landscape architecture firm Miller, Wihry and Brooks of Louisville. The gardens surrounding the Garden Pavilion were inspired by the cross-section of a clematis stem. The gardens were recently updated to reflect current Bernheim Select ™ perennials as well as old garden favorites and include examples of cutting, shade and butterfly gardens.\n\nOriginally built as the Nature Center and completed in 1962, this multi-functional building is sited on the old Jones Farm property. Silos from the original farm still stand near by. Today it houses administrative offices and remains a well-used venue for educational and cultural displays, events and includes a wild life viewing room. It is open year-round. The adjunct gardens include shade and sun gardens and the Kingfisher Pond.\n\nDesigned by the Louisville firm of Nevin and Morgan in 1961, the Garden Pavilion is a six-sided redwood structure located on Lake Nevin and reflects a mid-century modern style. It is surrounded by a vine-covered pergola, which cools the building in the summer. The building is the center of the clematis stem shaped configuration. The Garden Pavilion is available year-round for weddings, meetings and gatherings.\n\nThe Research Center opened in 2004, providing office space and research facilities for horticulture and forest management and meeting space for scientific research. Global Change, bird migration, insects, amphibians, small mammals, and grassland grazing as well as stream restoration are currently being studied. The cultivation of selected perennial and tree species take place in greenhouses within the complex.\n\nThe environmentally friendly and sustainably designed, innovative and award-winning Visitor Center opened to the public in 2005. Designed by William McDonough + Partners of Charlottesville, Virginia and Barnett and Bagley Architects of Lexington, it was conceived as a \"building like a tree\" with pergolas, arbors and living roof, along with other design feature that reflect the ecology of Kentucky, created to connect to its sense of place. It has received numerous awards including the Platinum level of the LEED certification program.\n\nLocated in the Children's Play Garden, five structures support large, living green roof boxes while providing seating, shelter and shade. Their contemporary design incorporates columns made from recycled trees found within the forest.\n\nBernheim Fire Lookout was constructed in 1929 by the Kentucky Division of Forestry. It is a 48' tall Aemotor tower with a 7'x7' metal cab. The lookout was regularly staffed until 1980. In 1986 it was used to monitor a wild fire. It was designated as a historical lookout on April 22, 1998 by the National Historical Lookout Register. Restoration and management is now handled by the Bernheim Foundation with help from the local community and the University of Kentucky.\n\nThe Art in Nature program provides a vital platform for artistic experimentation and curious exploration that becomes a part of the entire ecosystem of Bernheim and inspires our deep connections with nature, often providing a visitor with a sense of discovery. Its programs include the Artist in Residence Program, Sited @ Bernheim, Local Use by Local Artists and CONNECT. In addition, the following sculptures have been donated to Bernheim throughout its history:\n\n1998 Artist-in-Residence Karl Ciesluk created numerous works of art throughout Bernheim. The pieces are scattered throughout the forest and arboretum to become delights of discovery as it is explored. Each piece is composed of tiny-mirrored squares, creating a glittering effect and reflection of its surrounding.\n\nWith a $500,000 grant for stream restoration from the U.S. EPA, the University of Louisville Stream Institute bulldozed the riparian corridor of Wilson Creek in order to return a meandering course to the channel which had been straightened in the past to allow for farming. Native trees and wildflowers were planted, and fish populations increased. In 2011 beavers returned and their dams have removed sediment, adding clarity to the streamwater. Also their ponds have attracted birds, amphibians, reptiles, raccoon, and river otters.\n\n\n"}

It was released in March 1978 by the United Artists record label. This was the third line-up of Buzzcocks, with the guitarist Pete Shelley singing following the departure of the original vocalist Howard Devoto and then the firing of the bass guitarist Garth Smith (who had appeared on the \"Orgasm Addict\"/\"Whatever Happened To...?\" single). The album includes the single \"I Don't Mind\", which reached number 55 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1978.\n\nThe album's title was inspired by a collage by Linder Sterling. According to Shelley, \"Howard said, 'another housewife stews in her own juice in a different kitchen'. We shuffled it around a bit and it came out like that.\"\n\nThe sleeve design is by Malcolm Garrett. The original UK vinyl release was issued with a black cardboard inner sleeve, using a colour photo by Jill Furmanovsky on the front cover where Linder's image was intended to appear. Subsequent pressings substituted a black and white photo. The initial few thousand copies were shipped in a matching silver plastic shopping bag boldly with the word 'PRODUCT' on one side and the catalogue number \"UAG 30125\" on the other. Displaying the catalogue number prominently in this way was a common feature of Buzzcocks' artwork which was later picked up and taken to logical extremes by Factory Records where everything they produced was catalogued.\n\nThe first pressing inadvertently gave a songwriting credit for \"Fast Cars\" to Shelley/Devoto, when, according to Steve Diggle he wrote ninety percent of the song, which was a personal song based on a car crash in which he was involved.\n\nThe album was originally conceived with the track \"I Need\" on side one, but after a test pressing was made, the group felt the song should appear on the second side. A mix-up occurred at the pressing plant and, as a consequence, some early copies of the album contained no \"I Need\" at all.\n\nAn undated songbook was published with sheet music from the album, band photos, brief biographical material and a discography which includes the band's second release, \"Love Bites\". As such, it would have been released after 22 September 1978, the release date of \"Love Bites\". In keeping with other releases, the line \"Agreed Images\", which is a credit for the designer Malcolm Garrett / Assorted iMaGes, appears on the back cover below the stocking number.\n\nA blue vinyl version was re-released around 1986. The corresponding CD was released in March 1994 on the same record label, adding a second disc with \"Orgasm Addict\" and \"What Do I Get?\". EMI released a special edition (in 2008 in Europe, 2010 USA) with two CDs. Rhino Records re-released \"Another Music in a Different Kitchen\" in a limited edition of 6,200 copies on 180-gram translucent orange vinyl in 2015 for Black Friday Record Store Day.\n\nThe album's second track, \"No Reply\", was covered by SS Decontrol on their 1983 EP \"Get It Away\". The influential Seattle band The Fastbacks recorded \"Whatever Happened To...?\" on their 1991 single \"My Letters\", released by Sub Pop. The track \"Autonomy\" was covered by the pop punk band The Offspring on the single \"Want You Bad\".\n\nThe Sub Pop act Love Battery were named after the song of that name on this album.\n\n\"Another Music in a Different Kitchen\" was included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". In a retrospective review for BBC Music, the critic David Quantick named it as his favourite album of all-time and wrote, \"Everything about it – from its silver, orange-lettered sleeve to Martin Rushent's aluminium-sheen production – is right.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2030409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030409", "title": "Philip Green (author)", "text": "Philip Green (author)\n\nPhilip Green (born October 6, 1932) is an American political theorist and Sophia Smith Professor Emeritus of Smith College in Northampton, MA. An outspoken public intellectual, he is best known for his critiques of American liberal pluralism, beginning with a critique of American Cold War strategic policy based on massive nuclear deterrence and first-strike capability, to numerous recent writings about the retreat of representative democracy in the United States. His recent book, \"American Democracy: Selected Essays on Theory, Practice and Critique\" (2014), contains a compilation of many of those essays.\n\nGreen attended Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, PA, graduating with a BA in History (Magna cum Laude) in 1954. He received a Master’s in Public Administration from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in Princeton, NY (1961), as well as a PhD in Politics at Princeton (1965).\n\nGreen taught political theory in the Government Department at Smith College from 1964-1998, and was a Visiting Professor at the New School Graduate Center in New York from 2000-2009. Early in his career, he taught at Princeton University and Haverford College.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, he has been a frequent contributor to public policy journals and magazines on topics ranging from affirmative action to anti-Semitism. He has served on the editorial board of \"The Nation\" since 1978, He was co-chair of the American Writer’s Congress in New York in 1981, participated frequently in the Socialist Scholars Conference and its successor, the Left Forum. He is a founding member of the Caucus for a New Political Science within the American Political Science Association (APSA), and has appeared on numerous additional APSA panels.\n\nIn his first book, \"Deadly Logic: The Theory of Nuclear Deterrence\" (1966), Green criticized the allegedly scientific approach to the nuclear arms race advanced by strategic policy scholars and policymakers of the time. Their reliance on scientific solutions to nuclear escalation was, he argued, profoundly unscientific and inattentive to the deeper moral and political dimensions of the possibility of nuclear warfare. In a further development of that criticism in \"Science, Government, and the Case of Rand: A Singular Pluralism\" (\"World Politics\" 1968, reprinted in \"American Democracy\", ch. 2), he pointed out that the story of the Rand Corporation’s relationship to the theorists of nuclear deterrence gave lie to the conventional liberal pluralist notion that policy-setting in the U.S. was open to all would-be participants on an equal basis. The book and the essay were among the seminal critiques of liberal pluralism being developed out of the social and professional ferment of the 1960s. That essay was shortly followed by \"I Have a Philosophy, You Have an Ideology: Is Social Criticism Possible?\" (\"Massachusetts Review\", 1971, reprinted in \"American Democracy\", ch. 1), which argued that an appropriate respect for facts and reason distinguishes genuine philosophical or empirical argument from the illusions of ideological thinking.\n\nSince that time, his writing has depended both politically and methodologically on these two foundations: the problems of liberal pluralism and the confusion of ideology with philosophical argument. His writing has ranged broadly across a variety of political issues, from advancing a feminist critique of mass culture (\"Cracks in the Pedestal: Ideology and Gender in Hollywood\", 1998) to arguing in favor of open borders (\"American Democracy\", ch. 7). In particular, his essay, \"A Few Kind Words for Liberalism,\" which initially appeared in \"The Nation\" in 1992 (reprinted in \"American Democracy\", ch. 5) calls attention to the opaque but critical relationship between radicalism and liberalism. He argues that although liberals too often stop short of genuine change, leaving valuable reforms in the lurch, radicals need to recognize the Millian element in liberalism, the defense of individual rights, group rights and human rights. Thus, he asserts, liberalism and radicalism are inextricably linked, as each not only reveals itself but also challenges the shortcomings and hypocrisies of the other. He concludes that \"[t]he task for radicals...is...always to point out how much remains to be done after the latest bout of liberal reform, but not to treat liberalism as their primary enemy. It is not classical liberalism but rather a compromised and half-hearted version of it that makes supine compromises with political power brokers or corporate moneybags.\" (\"American Democracy\", p. 96).\n\nThroughout, as a theorist of democracy, Green has argued that the oligarchic and democratic elements of representative democracy are in constant tension (\"American Democracy\", ch. 6); that a truly representative and accountable government must have input from participants at all levels of public life (\"Retrieving Democracy\", 1985); and that representative democracy and modern capitalism—which deepens social inequalities and thus undermines the foundations of political equality—are fundamentally incompatible (\"Equality and Democracy\", 1999). Pointing out that vibrant democracy must be continuously open to mass protest movements (\"American Democracy\", ch. 11), he has argued that familiar defenses of social inequality are profoundly ideological and can only be overcome not by philosophy but by collective action (\"American Democracy\", ch. 4). In addition, he has pointed out that pro-democracy movements are repeatedly undermined by the increasing concentration of mass media (\"Primetime Politics\", 2005), and the unleashing of gigantic concentrations of wealth, as well as the tendency to institutionalize and contain democracy movements endemic in contemporary American politics (\"American Democracy\", ch. 9). Finally, he asserts, true democracy is dependent upon a strong state for its protection, rather than the night-watchman state of free-market theorists (\"American Democracy\", ch. 3).\n\n\nGreen is married to Dorothy Green, with whom he lives in New York City. He has two children, Laura Green, an English professor and Department Chair at Northeastern University, and Robert Green, a film and internet producer.\n\nHis memoir, \"Taking Sides: a Memoir in Stories\", is a nostalgic and ironic account of his personal, political, and intellectual development.\n\n\n"}

Its range also includes Kodagu in Karnataka, Kodayar Hills in Tamil Nadu, and many other hilly areas in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This primate has glossy black fur on its body and golden brown fur on its head. It is similar in size and long-tailed like the gray langurs. Females have a white patch of fur on the inner thigh. It typically lives in troops of nine to ten monkeys. Its diet consists of fruits, shoots and leaves. The species is classified as vulnerable due to habitat destruction and poaching for its fur and flesh, the latter believed to have aphrodisiac properties.\n\nThe classification of the Nilgiri langur has been disputed. Traditionally it has been placed within the genus \"Trachypithecus\" based on morphological similarities such as cranial morphology and neonatal pelage color, and within the \"Trachypithecus vetulus\" group within \"Trachypithecus\" based on a presumed close relationship with the purple-faced langur, which had been classified as \"Trachypithecus vetulus\". DNA and other evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur are more closely related to the gray langurs and have thus been reclassified within the genus \"Semnopithecus\".\n\nThe head-plus-body length is 78–80 cm in adult males and 58–60 cm in adult females, with the tail adding between 68.5 and 96.5 cm. The males weigh 9.1-14.8 kg, the females 10.9–12 kg. The gestation period is not precisely known but assumed to be similar to the closely related Hanuman Langur, i.e. 200 days.\n\n"}

In 1925, Jamaica's national team had its first international match against Haiti and won all three games 1–0, 2–1, and 3–0. In 1926, Jamaica hosted Haiti at Sabina Park and won 6–0. The Haitians remained frequent opponents, and it was not until 1932 that their run of defeats was broken with a 4–1 home win in Port-au-Prince.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1962, Jamaica had regular games with teams from Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, and Cuba, as well as with clubs like the Haitian Racing CH and Violette AC, the British Corinthians, and the Argentinean Tigers. Many of the games were played at Sabina Park and many clubs were established, including Melbourne, Kingston, Kensington, Lucas and St. George's Old Boys. In 1952, the Caribbean All-Star team was formed with players from Trinidad, Cuba, Haiti, and Suriname. The team played four matches against Jamaica in Sabina Park. Jamaica won the second game 2–1 and the fourth 1–0, and the All-Stars won the first game 5–1 and the third 1–0. Noted Jamaican players included Lindy Delapenha and Gillie Heron.\n\nIn 1965, under the leadership of Brazilian coach Jorge Penna, Jamaica made its first attempt at World Cup qualifying. This was for the 1966 World Cup finals in England. The preliminary group included Cuba, the Netherlands Antilles, and Jamaica. Jamaica's first game was against Cuba which they won 2–0 at Jamaica's National Stadium. In the qualifying match against the Netherlands Antilles, Jamaica also had a 2–0 victory with both goals coming. In the away games Jamaica was held to a goalless draw with the Netherlands Antilles and suffered a 2–1 defeat to Cuba. Jamaica then advanced to the final group of three, which included Costa Rica and Mexico. The winner of this group would represent the CONCACAF region. Jamaica lost at home to Mexico 3–2 and in the return leg in Mexico City the high altitude proved too much for the Jamaicans and they were defeated 8–0. Jamaica lost 7–0 to Costa Rica in their first encounter and had a 1–1 tie when they played at home.\n\nIn 1968, George Hamilton became the new coach as Jamaica attempted to qualify for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. Jamaica had only a few remaining players from its previous World Cup team and had to rebuild because most of its players had retired or migrated abroad. Jamaica lost all of its qualifying games in that year.\n\nJamaica's participation in the 1974 World Cup elimination saw the suspension of 17 players on the team because of poor behavior on a tour to Bermuda. Jamaica withdrew from the elimination in order to restructure their team.\n\nThe 1978 World Cup in Argentina saw Jamaica playing Cuba and losing 3–1 at the National Stadium and then 2–0 in Havana, Cuba. Jamaica did not qualify.\n\nIn 1982 Jamaica did not make an attempt for the World Cup Final set in Spain due to insufficient funds and a poorly prepared team. Jamaica did not participate in the 1986 World Cup because suspension for affiliation fees that was due to FIFA.\n\nIn preparation for the 1990 World Cup with coach Jeffery Maxwell, Jamaica won both preliminary games against Puerto Rico 1–0 in Jamaica and 2–0 at Puerto Rico. The U.S. were the next opponents and was held to a goalless draw. The return leg in the U.S. saw Jamaica losing 5–1 bringing an end to their qualifying attempt.\n\nThe United States hosted the World Cup 1994. In qualifying Jamaica beat Puerto Rico 2–1 and was then faced Bermuda, Canada, and El Salvador from which two teams would advance to the final round. Jamaica tied 1–1 with Canada and Bermuda and then lost 2–0 to El Salvador, 1–0 to Canada, 2–1 to El Salvador. Jamaica then beat Bermuda 3–2 but did not qualify.\n\nUnder Brazilian Professor Renê Simões and National coach Carl Brown, the Jamaican team became a powerhouse in the Caribbean region and received the \"Best Mover\" award by FIFA in 1996.\n\nJamaica made history by becoming the first English-speaking country from the Caribbean to ever qualify for the World Cup finals.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2030477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030477", "title": "Connections (TV series)", "text": "Connections (TV series)\n\nConnections is a 10-episode documentary television series and 1978 book (\"Connections\", based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian James Burke. The series was produced and directed by Mick Jackson of the BBC Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA). It took an interdisciplinary approach to the history of science and invention, and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and dry humour), historical re-enactments, and intricate working models.\n\nThe popular success of the series led to the production of \"The Day the Universe Changed\" (1985), a similar program but showing a more linear history of several important scientific developments. Years later, the success in syndication led to two sequels, \"Connections\" (1994) and \"Connections\" (1997), both for TLC. In 2004, KCSM-TV produced a program called \"Re-Connections\", consisting of an interview of Burke and highlights of the original series, for the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast in the USA on PBS.\n\n\"Connections\" explores an \"Alternative View of Change\" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religion) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.\n\nTo demonstrate this view, Burke begins each episode with a particular event or innovation in the past (usually ancient or medieval times) and traces the path from that event through a series of seemingly unrelated connections to a fundamental and essential aspect of the modern world. For example, the episode \"The Long Chain\" traces the invention of plastics from the development of the fluyt, a type of Dutch cargo ship.\n\nBurke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events of which we were not even aware at the time.\n\nThe second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but also to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly 'change' itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.\n\nLastly, if the entire modern world is built from these interconnected innovations, all increasingly maintained and improved by specialists who required years of training to gain their expertise, what chance does the average citizen without this extensive training have in making an informed decision on practical technological issues, such as the building of nuclear power plants or the funding of controversial projects such as stem cell research? Furthermore, if the modern world is increasingly interconnected, what happens when one of those nodes collapses? Does the entire system follow suit?\n\nThe original 1978 Connections 10-episode documentary television series and had a companion book (\"Connections\", based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian James Burke. The 1978 Connections companion book was published about the time the middle of the series was airing, so likely was written in parallel to the series and had a post-production editing release. The very popular book was re-released as a work in a 1995 edition, 1998, (relations to sections below is unknown.) and again in 2007 as both hardcover or softcover editions. Since the television series varied in content with each corresponding production run and release, it is likely the companion volumes (as is suggest by the plethora of ISBN codes) are also different works. This 1978 work's coverage deviates in some topics and details being both more in depth and a bit broader, from the lighter coverage of the episodes. It can be found in many libraries. \n\n\n\nAll three \"Connections\" documentaries have been released in their entirety as DVD box sets in the US. The ten episodes of series one were released in Europe (Region 2) on 6 February 2017.\n\nBurke also wrote a series of \"Connections\" articles in \"Scientific American\", and published a book of the same name (1995, ), all built on the same theme of exploring the history of science and ideas, going back and forth through time explaining things on the way and, generally, coming back to the starting point.\n\nBurke produced another documentary series called \"The Day the Universe Changed\" in 1985, which explored man's concept of how the universe worked in a manner similar to the original \"Connections\".\n\n\"\" is a video series launched in 2011 on Kickstarter.com that was inspired by James Burke's \"Connections\". However, it follows concepts rather than inventions through time.\n\n\"Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections\", shown on BBC2, follows a similar format.\n\n\"Connections\", a \"Myst\"-style computer game with James Burke and others providing video footage and voice acting, was released in 1995. It was a runner-up for \"Computer Gaming World\"s award for the best \"Classics/Puzzles\" game of 1995, which ultimately went to \"You Don't Know Jack\". The editors wrote of \"Connections\", \"That you enjoy yourself so much you hardly realize that you're learning is a tribute to the design.\"\n\nA clip from the episode \"Yesterday, Tomorrow and You\" appears in the 2016 video game The Witness.\n\n"}

{"id": "2030540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030540", "title": "Osarseph", "text": "Osarseph\n\nOsarseph or Osarsiph () is a legendary figure of Ancient Egypt who has been equated with Moses. His story was recounted by the Ptolemaic Egyptian historian Manetho in his \"Aigyptiaca\" (first half of the 3rd century BC); Manetho's work is lost, but the 1st century AD Jewish historian Josephus quotes extensively from it.\n\nThe story depicts Osarseph as a renegade Egyptian priest who leads an army of lepers and other unclean people against a pharaoh named Amenophis. The pharaoh is driven out of the country and the leper-army, in alliance with the Hyksos (whose story is also told by Manetho) ravage Egypt, committing many sacrileges against the gods, before Amenophis returns and expels them. Towards the end of the story Osarseph changes his name to Moses.\n\nMuch debated is the question of what, if any, historical reality might lie behind the Osarseph story. The story has been linked with anti-Jewish propaganda of the second and first centuries BCE as an inversion of the Exodus story, but an influential study by Egyptologist Jan Assmann has suggested that no single historical incident or person lies behind the legend, and that it represents instead a conflation of several historical traumas, notably the religious reforms of Akhenaten (Amenophis IV).\n\nThe story of Osarseph is known from two long quotations from the \"Aigyptiaca\", a history of Egypt by the Egyptian historian Manetho, in Josephus's \"Against Apion\". The first is Manetho's account of the expulsion of the Hyksos (the name is given by Manetho) and their settlement in Judea, where they found the city of Jerusalem. Josephus then draws the conclusion that Manetho's Hyksos were the Jews of the Exodus, although Manetho himself makes no such connection.\n\nThe second, set some two hundred years later, tells the story of Osarseph. According to Josephus, Manetho described Osarseph as a tyrannical high priest of Osiris at Heliopolis. Pharaoh Amenophis had a desire to see the gods, but in order to do so he first had to cleanse Egypt of lepers and other polluted people, setting 80,000 of them to work in the stone quarries, and then confining them to Avaris, the former Hyksos capital in the Eastern Delta. There Osarseph became their leader and ordered them to give up the worship of the gods and eat the meat of the holy animals. The Osarsephites then invited the Hyksos back into Egypt, and together with their new allies drove Amenophis and his son Ramses into exile in Nubia and instituted a 13-year reign of religious oppression: towns and temples were devastated, the images of the gods destroyed, the sanctuaries turned into kitchens and the sacred animals roasted over fires, until eventually Amenophis and Rameses returned to expel the lepers and the Hyksos and restore the old Egyptian religion. Towards the end of the story Manetho reports that Osarseph took the name \"Moses\".\n\nThree interpretations have been proposed for the story: the first, as a memory of the Amarna period; the second, as a memory of the Hyksos; and the third, as an anti-Jewish propaganda. Each explanation has evidence to support it: the name of the pharaoh, Amenophis, and the religious character of the conflict fit the Amarna reform of Egyptian religion; the name of Avaris and possibly the name Osarseph fit the Hyksos period; and the overall plot is an apparent inversion of the Jewish story of the Exodus casting the Jews in a bad light. No one theory, however, can explain all the elements. An influential proposition by Egyptologist Jan Assmann suggests that the story has no single origin but rather combines numerous historical experiences, notably the Amarna and Hyksos periods, into a folk memory. (An alternative theory that identifies Osarseph with the historical figure of Chancellor Bay, an alleged Syrian usurper of the Egyptian throne after the Nineteenth Dynasty, is generally rejected.\n\nIt is possible that Osarseph story, or at least the point at which Osarseph changes his name to Moses, is an alteration to Manetho's original history made in the 1st century BC when anti-Jewish sentiment was running high in Egypt, since without this Manetho's history has no mention of the Jews at all. If the story is an original part of Manetho's history of Egypt, the question arises of where he could have heard it, as the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Torah (i.e., the Exodus narrative) had not been made when he was writing. It is possible that he had an oral (Jewish) informant, or possibly an otherwise unknown pre-Septuagint translation.\n\n"}

It was part of the Glyndŵr Rising or Welsh Revolt of 1400–1415.\n\nStalling Down is a rolling area of open land a few miles east of the town of Cowbridge, now the village common of St Hilary in the Vale of Glamorgan. The exact site of the battle and the precise details of the action are not known. The general site is known locally as Bryn Owain, meaning Owain's Hill.\n\nThe site was known as Stallington, evolving to Stalling Down. A Roman road runs over the hill as it traverses the area and would have been a convenient route for moving a very large army along for the English.\n\nThe Welsh army included a French contingent assimilated into forces from Morgannwg led by Rhys Gethin ('swarthy Rhys') and Cadwgan, Lord of Glyn Rhondda commanding the contingent from the Rhondda Valleys region. Cadwgan had a home at Aberochwy, near what is today Treorchy. He fought using a battleaxe as his weapon of choice and was later known as Cadwgan of the Bloody Axe. Owain Glyndŵr is also reported to have been present in the battle in person.\n\nThe battle is said to have lasted 18 hours and resulted in an appalling defeat for the King's army. The blood was fetlock deep on the horses that survived the battle.\n\nThe English army retreated through Cardiff pursued by the Welsh in terrible conditions, which included a thunderstorm and flooding.\n\nIn nearby Llanblethian church in 1896 explorations prior to Victorian church improvements revealed an oak plank in the floor, which when prised up, revealed a stone stairway descending to a crypt. Inside the crypt were piled three hundred male skeletons, without coffins. The crypt measured some seventeen feet by fifteen and stood seven feet high at its highest point, the apex of the arched and vaulted roof. Small wall openings to the exterior had been covered up on the outside by earth, effectively sealing the crypt to the outside world.\n\nThe bones were immediately buried in the churchyard. The clerk's pew contains an inscription that this church was the burial place of the Sweeting family 'before the war with Owen Glyndŵr'.\n\nThe church is some three miles from the battle ground.\n\nMore recently, historians have begun to question the veracity of the report of a battle at Stalling Down; for example, a modern authority on Glyndŵr, the late R. R. Davies, made no mention of it in his account of the revolt, published in 1995. The problem lies in the fact that the earliest recorded reference to the battle is late, and is found in the works of the 18th-century writer Iolo Morganwg. Morganwg was well known for taking liberties with Welsh history, and the 'ancient' manuscript on which he is supposed to have based his account of Stalling Down has never been traced. Morganwg's account held considerable sway for some years, and was repeated by several later writers, including the Edwardian historian Arthur Bradley in his 1901 biography of Owain Glyndŵr. In it, he places the battle in 1405, calling it the 'battle of Bryn Owen'. Such uncritical recountings of Morganwg's version of events have had a considerable effect on popular perceptions of Glyndŵr's revolt in the Glamorgan area.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of this uncertainty it is not safe to conclude that Stalling Down never occurred. There is much local tradition to be found in connection with it (see above), and the context of a battle in either the summer of 1403 or 1405 accords well with our understanding of the progress of Glyndŵr's revolt. Glyndŵr's presence at nearby Carmarthen in the summer of 1403 is well attested, and it may be that an incursion into nearby Glamorgan produced a confrontation of which the battle of Stalling Down, as remembered today, is a manifestation.\n\n"}

Although he never saw active service in the field during the two world wars, he became Chief of the General Staff in command of the Union Defence Force in 1949. He resigned after only a short time in this position, citing the interference in military matters by Minister of Defence Frans Erasmus as the reason for his resignation.\n\nLeonard Beyers was born in Kimberley, Cape Colony on 22 January 1894 to Pieter Gerhard Beyers and his wife, Anna Maria Elizabeth Bredell.\n\nAfter his schooling, Beyers followed a career in the army. In 1913 he was attached to the Royal Scots Fusiliers, with whom he trained while they were at Roberts Heights. After his initial training he was commissioned in the Witwatersrand Rifles.\n\nIn 1914, after four months service at the Military School in Bloemfontein, Beyers was appointed to the Permanent Force with the rank of lieutenant. He served as adjutant of units in Bloemfontein, Standerton and Cape Town. In 1915, at the latter posting, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He was stationed in Cape Town for the greater part of the First World War. In 1917, he was transferred to Johannesburg and in 1918 he became deputy assistant adjutant-general at Defence Headquarters, Pretoria.\n\nWhile Beyers was a staff officer to the Cape Peninsula Garrison in 1922, he saw active service on the only occasion in his entire life. He served as a member of the force which suppressed the Bondelswarts Rebellion.\n\nBeyers acted as aide-de-camp to the Governor-General, the Earl of Athlone in 1924–25. He then attended staff courses in England.\n\nOn his return to South Africa in 1927, Beyers was appointed officer instructor at the Military College at Roberts Heights. In the next four years he acted on occasion as commandant of the College and of Roberts Heights. This gave him the opportunity to develop his abilities as a military leader.\n\nIn 1928, Beyers was promoted to the rank of major and as a result of his increased responsibilities he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1930. In 1931, he was appointed commanding officer of No. 5 Military District Pretoria.\n\nIn 1932, Beyers was appointed director (military) of Prison Services. As a result of this move he was placed on the reserve of officers. According to the 2005 \"Jali Commission\", the military nature of the pre-1994 South African Prisons Service was put in place with the appointment of Beyers as Director of Prisons. The structure, mode of dress and the institutional culture was military in every respect, indicated by a rank structure similar to that used in the army and the requirement that non-commissioned members salute commissioned members.\nThe demilitarisation of the correctional system was finally effected by the post-Apartheid government on 1 April 1996.\n\nIn 1937, Beyers returned to the Permanent Force as assistant commandant-in-chief, Burger Commandos. Later that year he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he relinquished his post in favour of becoming director-general of the Defence Rifle Association, a post he held for almost a year before becoming Adjutant-general. He visited South African troops in the Middle East and acted as Chief of the General Staff when General Sir Pierre van Ryneveld was in North Africa.\n\nBeyers gave up his post as Adjutant-general in 1945 owing to ill health and was placed on the retired list four months later. His retirement was short lived, however, for in 1949 he was appointed acting Chief of the General Staff with the rank of lieutenant general. On 2 May 1949, he succeeded Van Ryneveld as Chief of the General Staff. He remained in this position for only a short time, resigning on 15 March 1950. The reason for his resignation was the interference in military matters and appointment of staff without consultation by Frans Erasmus, the Minister of Defence. Before resigning, Beyers had lengthy correspondence with both Erasmus and the Prime Minister, D. F. Malan, on the matter:\nBeyers was once again placed on the retired list in 1954.\n\nThe fact that at times he acted as Chief of the General Staff during the Second World War indicates that Van Ryneveld had immense trust in Beyers' abilities. However, Van Ryneveld was such a dominating personality that any meaningful delegation of his authority was never even discussed.\n\nDuring his career, Beyers was awarded the British War Medal for his services during the First World War, and the War Medal 1939-45 and Africa Service Medal for the Second World War. Probably because he never saw active service in the field during the two world wars he would not wear ribbons on his uniform.\n\nBeyers married Evelyn Alice Jess Hunter and had a son and a daughter. He died in East London, Eastern Cape Province on 15 April 1959.\n"}

Their debut album, \"Dirty Words\", was released 13 June 2005 by Parlophone. A second album, \"Inventions\", was expected to be released in early 2008, but was not (due to issues with the band's record label, Parlophone). The band split up on 30 January 2008.\n\nThe group formed in January 2004 after starting in Northampton as a collaboration between a former Christian commune member David Jones (vocals/guitar) and his friend Sam Harvey. After recruiting old school associate Ben Winton (bass) and Lee Irons (guitar), the lineup was completed with the addition of Andy Hobson (drums) via a musician's ad website. Jones described the concept of the band to music webzine Drowned in Sound: \"We all got quite excited about the whole ethos of what we’re trying to do, which is to take 1980s reference points and transcend them into modern day, edgy, instant kind of sounds.\"\n\nThey were signed to Parlophone after playing only three gigs and being together for just four months, a fact that attracted a considerable level of derision and scepticism. Touring slots with The Killers, Feeder, Duran Duran, Placebo, supporting them at Wembley Arena, The Tears and a reformed Gang Of Four soon followed as the band sought to build a support base ahead of their first wing of releases. Debut single \"All Mapped Out\" was released on 2 August 2004 and debuted at number 30 on the UK singles chart. The track was included on the soundtrack to \"\". Follow-up single \"Be My Enemy\" emerged on 18 October 2004 and was included on the soundtrack to \"FIFA 06\".\n\nThey released a debut album \"Dirty Words\", produced by Steve Osborne (who also worked with New Order, Suede and Happy Mondays), a year after signing to Parlophone at Realworld Studios in Bath. The album was trailed the week before its release by the reissue of the \"All Mapped Out\" single. Disappointingly it was lower in the charts than the original. The album drew a middling response from critics, who varied between praising the album for its bleak, futuristic atmosphere and slating it for its perceived superficiality and over-reliance on the music of the 80s for inspiration.\n\nA UK tour and festival appearances followed soon after. In early 2006, Lee Irons had left the band citing artistic differences.\nAndy Hobson left later that year and was replaced by the original drummer, Simon Alexander.

{"id": "2030585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030585", "title": "WMVP", "text": "WMVP\n\nWMVP (1000 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Chicago, Illinois, United States, carrying ESPN Radio's sports radio format, along with a number of local programs. It is owned by ABC, Inc. and operated by Good Karma Brands. The station's transmitter is located in Downers Grove.\n\nWMVP airs both local programs and nationally syndicated sports shows. Weekdays begin with \"Golic and Wingo\", a national program from ESPN, while \"Waddle and Silvy\", \"Carmen and Jurko\", and \"Kap and Company\" are more focused on Chicago sports. WMVP is currently the flagship station of the Chicago Wolves, the AHL affiliate of the St. Louis Blues of the NHL. Until 2016, it was the flagship station of the Chicago Bulls of the NBA (now heard on WSCR). WMVP also airs Northwestern Wildcats football and basketball games whenever flagship station WGN is unable to air the games due to other broadcast agreements. It also carries ESPN Radio's national play-by-play of Major League Baseball, the College Football Playoff, and the NBA.\nFrom 1926 to 1987, 1000 AM was WCFL, the radio voice of the Chicago Federation of Labor. WMVP is a Class A radio station, broadcasting at 50,000 watts, the maximum power for commercial AM stations. It shares 1000 AM, a clear channel frequency, with KOMO Seattle and XEOY Mexico City. WMVP uses a directional antenna to avoid interfering with those other stations. WMVP's powerful nighttime signal allows it to be heard by listeners around the Midwestern United States and Central Canada.\n\n In 1922, the American Federation of Labor began discussions regarding owning and operating its own radio station. By 1925, the AFL decided not to enter the broadcasting business but to purchase time for organized labor's message on commercially operated radio. The dream stayed alive with the Chicago Federation of Labor, who believed having an owned and operated radio station would be an effective way to spread its message. In 1924, the Federation gave its approval to work toward establishing a radio station. The original plan for WCFL called for it to be a non-commercial station, operating on the support of its listeners; in a sense it was one of the first large-scale efforts at public radio. Spearheading the drive to make WCFL a reality was the Federation's Secretary, Edward Nockels (1869–1937); without his efforts, there would have been no radio station at all.\n\nWCFL officially began on December 4, 1925; the Federation's hopes were temporarily dashed when the US Department of Commerce (there was no Federal Communications Commission until 1934 and no Federal Radio Commission which preceded it until 1927) refused to grant WCFL a wavelength on January 13, 1926. Just five days after what could have become an end to the station, the Federation announced it would go ahead with building it anyway.\n\nThe first WCFL transmitter stood on Chicago's Navy Pier (then called Municipal Pier); the Federation was able to lease the pier's North Tower for 10 years at $1 per year and its willingness to make WCFL available for city broadcasts. Initially the Illinois Manufacturers' Association attempted to keep WCFL off the air by protesting the use of public property for the station's transmitter and broadcasting site. The station purchased the land in Downers Grove where the current transmitter operates in 1928 and broke ground there in 1932. The Federation originally purchased of land in the western suburb; 20 of them were allotted for the WCFL transmitter, while the other 80 were subdivided as lots for 258 homes and 72 businesses in \"WCFL Park\". Nockels believed having a union-based community spring up around the WCFL transmitter would be beneficial to both those purchasing lots and building homes and to the station itself. The labor union entered the real estate business shortly before the Depression hit. After selling no lots in the early part of the 1930s, the Federation put WCFL Park on hold, reviving it again in 1939 with the building of a model home on one of the lots, all of which would eventually be divested.\n\nAM 1000 began operation as WCFL in test broadcasts on June 19, 1926; the Commerce Department granted it call letters on July 10, 1926. It was officially on the air the next day at 610 KC with 1,000 watts of power, one of the last non-profit radio stations to take to the airwaves. The first broadcast consisted of two hours of music. In November 1926, with an eye toward being self-sustaining, the Federation added a shortwave station to the Navy Pier transmitter site, planning to use WCFL Radio Telegraph to help offset broadcasting costs. The station initially used studios at Navy Pier, but during the winter of 1926–1927 found that the weather often made them inaccessible. By 1927, WCFL was broadcasting from 623 South Wabash in Chicago (today the home of Columbia College, Chicago,) producing a quarterly radio magazine, and operating on 620 kHz;the frequency being shared with the Lane Tech High School radio station, WLTS. In 1928, WCFL applied to the Federal Radio Commission for an increase in its transmitter power and hours of operation. Several other radio stations were now also operating on the 620 kHz frequency along with WCFL and the Lane Tech station. The commission disagreed with the reasoning that such increases were necessary to serve union members. Further, it cut the operating power of WCFL to only 1,500 watts. General Order 40 brought WCFL to the 970 KC frequency, shared with KJR in Seattle, still at 1,500 watts and now allowed to operate in daylight only. The Federal Radio Commission had labeled the station as a \"propaganda\" type, not truly worthy of a license. The FRC would grant WCFL a 5,000 watt license in 1932, but it would take some years of expensive discussions to attain clear-channel, 50,000-watt status.\n\nWhile the original idea of a self-supporting WCFL was based on each Federation member's donation of $1 a year for all station operating expenses, by 1926, 30% of the membership had donated. The donations continued to spiral downward as time passed, especially after 1928, when WCFL's operating power was cut and it was limited to \"dawn to dusk\" broadcasting—from sunrise to sunset. The dawn-to-dusk operation limitations were lifted in 1929, but there was still no clear channel yet for WCFL. 1929 found the station notifying the Federation that unless members made their dollar donations, WCFL would need to implement some type of commercial broadcasting to stay afloat. This was the reason why the transmitter land had been purchased in 1928, but no construction was able to be done on the Downers Grove transmitter site until 1932. By 1930, commercials had become a reality on WCFL; the station did not show a profit until 1940.\n\nIn 1927, WCFL broadcast the Gene Tunney-Jack Dempsey championship boxing match at Soldier Field, challenging the National Broadcasting Company's exclusive claim to the event. This led to an arrangement whereby WCFL became one of three affiliates in Chicago of the Blue Network of NBC; WCFL broadcast non-sponsored, or sustaining, NBC programs not carried by WENR or WLS, as well as selected major sporting events and any broadcast speeches by union leaders aired by the network. WCFL became a member of the Mutual Broadcasting System in December 1949. When the Federal Communications Commission forced NBC to sell the Blue Network, WCFL's affiliation continued with the network through its new identity as the American Broadcasting Company, ending with the merger of WENR and WLS in 1959. Prior to this, the station offered selected programming from the network. WCFL was also to become an affiliate of the Amalgamated Broadcasting System in 1933, but that network collapsed after only a month of operations, prior to its planned westward expansion from New York. The usual broadcast day included dance and classical music, comedy, as well as radio programs in 11 different languages designed to reach out to Chicago's immigrant population.\n\nWCFL was also involved in early experimental television broadcasts, and operated a shortwave repeater station, W9XAA, in the 1930s. This was the first television station in Chicago. On June 19, 1928, Ulises Armand Sanabria, a local television pioneer, made the first Chicago television broadcast using the WCFL Navy Pier transmitter to send the video portion of the signal and Chicago radio station WIBO for the audio portion. Those with receivers were able to see a head and shoulders view of Edward Nockels, the Federation secretary and driving force behind WCFL. It's also possible the broadcast was simulcast by the WCFL shortwave station, W9XAA. Accounts of later broadcasts at WMAQ specify their shortwave station was used for this purpose. As the Federation tried to revive their \"WCFL Park\" real estate project near the Downers Grove transmitter, the decision was made to abandon W9XAA in 1937, preferring to concentrate on gaining more transmitter power for WCFL. New Federal Communications Commission rules insisted that shortwave stations have a minimum of 5,000 watts of power; the cost to WCFL to upgrade to this level would have been around $10,000. In the 1941 NARBA reallocation, WCFL moved to 1000 kHz. The same year, it was granted a Class 1-B clear channel license, and increased its power to 10,000 watts. In 1948, its power was increased to 50,000 watts.\n\nIn 1948, the Federation was granted a license for an FM radio station, WCFL-FM on 104.3 MHz. Its transmitter was atop the American Furniture Mart, where WCFL's studios and offices had been located since 1931. WCFL-FM went on the air March 12, 1949, and simulcast its sister AM station's programming for six hours a day–from 3 PM to 9 PM. This time the Federation was impatient for its new radio station to become profitable, having gone from 1926–1940 before WCFL was \"in the black\". On January 10, 1950, WCFL-FM went off the air permanently; the Federation believed its dollars were better spent for its AM radio station. Today the frequency is occupied by WBMX, and the call letters belong to a station in Morris, Illinois that is now owned by the Illinois Bible Institute.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the Federation's thoughts turned once again to television, and in 1953 it applied for VHF channel 11 in Chicago. The Federation lost the bid to the city's educational groups, who would put WTTW on the air in 1955. An early 1960s try netted the Federation a license for Chicago UHF channel 38. In June 1968, plans were made for building a transmitter and antenna atop Chicago's John Hancock Center, as well as other construction needs to get WCFL-TV on the air. By late 1970, the Federation had begun to look at other uses for the station's license which didn't involve the organization. Christian Communications purchased WCFL-TV in August 1975, with the FCC approving the license transfer in early 1976. At the time of the sale, WCFL-TV had yet to be on the air; it became WCFC-TV and, later, WCPX-TV.\n\nThe station carried general entertainment over the decades but by the late 1950s WCFL evolved into a popular music station, which had banned all Elvis Presley records from its playlist in late November 1957. The pre-Top 40 talent lineup included Dan Sorkin in the morning, Mike Rapchak (1920–2006) following him and Sid McCoy's all-night jazz program. It was Sorkin who introduced a young Chicago comedian, Bob Newhart, to Warner Bros. in 1959. Bob Elson did both White Sox games and interviewed celebrities at the Pump Room; his sports cohort, Milo Hamilton, also wore two hats, talking football and playing music. Rapchak, who quit on the air in 1965 due to WCFL's new format, returned there in 1978, once again playing big band and jazz music.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1965, WLS was the only Top 40 station in Chicago. This situation was unusual, as most major cities had two or even three stations featuring pop music. Consequently, WLS had become somewhat complacent as it had no real competitors. This all changed in 1965, when WCFL became a Top 40 music station, competing with WLS. The station also moved from the American Furniture Mart where it had been since 1931, to the then new Marina City, where it remained for the next 20 years. While the station itself was on the 16th floor of the Commercial Building (today the Hotel Chicago Downtown), WCFL also had a \"VIP Room\" on the fifth floor where the \"WCFL VIPs\" (DJs) hosted various events such as record parties and autograph sessions for listeners who were members of the WCFL VIP Club. One of the station's first promotions was the \"Bold\" campaign-describing itself as a bold, new way of presenting today's music and its listeners (who wore \"I'm Bold!\" buttons) as bold enough to want a change.\n\nGeneral Manager Ken Draper ran the station from 1965–1968 and brought many of the original staffers with him from the big Cleveland rock station (KYW/WKYC) he had run before. These included not only DJs but also chief engineer Mike King (later, Jim Loupas), and members of the crack newsroom team, which included the unstoppable Jeff Kamen. WCFL gained fame in 1966 when Kamen followed Chicago Civil Rights leader and comedy star Dick Gregory to Mississippi and wound getting beaten by the KKK while reporting on a voter registration protest. The network TV film of the attack was seen by millions. A still picture ending up on newspapers' front pages. Prior to Draper's establishment of an eight-person news department, news was gathered by taking the copy from the station's news wires and reading it on the air.\n\nIn their Top 40 years, some famous disc jockeys on WCFL included Jim Runyon (1931–1973), Joel Sebastian (1932-1986), Dick Williamson, (who was already with WCFL at the time of the format change), Jim Stagg (1935–2007), Ron Britain, (\"America's First Psychedelic Disk Johnny\"), who did a second stint at the station in 1978, the legendary Dick Biondi, whose Mutual Radio syndicated \"Dick Biondi's Young America\" show was heard here 3 years before his actual arrival, Barney Pip (1936-1994), Ron Riley, Sid McCoy and Yvonne Daniels (1991) with late night jazz during the earliest days of the change to Top 40. In late 1966, WKYC popular afternoon DJ Jerry Ghan (now Jerry G. Bishop)(1936-2013) also decided to follow Draper to WCFL for AM drive. Later, WIND's former long-time morning man Howard Miller (1994), who was a decided departure from the youthful staff, came to helm 'CFL's 6-9AM spot in 1968. He was replaced before long by Clark Weber, long-time WLS morning man. \n\nThe DJ secretary during this era was Connie Szerszen, who went on to forge her own career on the air in Chicago radio, appearing on WIND and other stations. WCFL General Manager Ken Draper also hired Carole Simpson as one of radio's first female newscasters; Carole went on to a big career with ABC-TV. Also on staff at that time was continuity director Barbara Sternig, who left for LA once the Beatles broke up, became Rona Barrett's writer, and later Senior Reporter in Hollywood for the National Enquirer. Draper is also credited with the introduction of the Sound 10/WCFL survey, which became a competitor to the WLS \"Silver Dollar Survey\" that station issued weekly beginning in 1960. From 1966–1970, the station produced six \"branded\" record albums. Later in the SuperCFL-era Larry Lujack (1940-2013) and Art Roberts (1931-2002) came to WCFL.\n\nWCFL's coverage of The Beatles 1965\nand 1966 US tours was provided by Jim Stagg, who traveled with the group. The station began a weekly \"British Countdown\" program with British DJ Paul Michael, in 1965.\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, WCFL also featured a popular Sunday night program of \"underground\" album-oriented music called \"Ron Britain's Subterranean Circus\". Due to madcap DJ Britain's sure ear for the innovative and his highly inventive sketches, plus WCFL's powerful AM nighttime signal, these programs gained huge listenership not just in the Chicago area, but in other parts of the country as well. Britain's \"Sub Circus\" made WCFL one of the few AM stations to feature this kind of music, which was a major staple of \"underground\" FM stations. The station also supported local bands with its Sunday evening \"Chicago Countdown\", hosted by Ron Britain, featuring the recordings of Chicago area music groups.\n\nThe comedy feature \"Chickenman\", a satire based on the \"Batman\" TV series, originated on Jim Runyon's morning drive-time show in the fall of 1966. It was created by WCFL staffer Dick Orkin, who was also brought from Cleveland to Chicago by Ken Draper. All the voices were done by Orkin, Runyon, and Jane Roberts, who also did WCFL's morning traffic reports as \"Trooper 36-24-36\" (She became Mrs. Jim Runyon.). The \"Chickenman\" program was subsequently syndicated to radio stations worldwide.\n\nIn August 1968, sales manager Lew Witz replaced Draper as WCFL General Manager. Witz continued to make changes to the station during his tenure. It was Witz who lured Larry Lujack away from WLS in 1972, and the \"less talk-more music\" philosophy continued. On August 8, 1974, Richard Nixon announced his resignation from the office of President of the United States. The announcement occurred at 8 PM Chicago time, but there was no acknowledgement of it on WCFL's airwaves until 11:30 PM. Witz defended his decision by saying there was ample local and national coverage of the story so there was no need to interrupt the music on WCFL. Gary Deeb, media critic for the Chicago Tribune, blasted Witz in print, saying it was this decision and many others like it that turned WCFL from, \"a bright, civic-minded 50,000 watt rock powerhouse into a sonic slum.\" By the time the station prepared to enter its \"Beautiful Music\" phase in early 1976, Witz had totally done away with WCFL's news department. Under the management of Witz, the station's turntables used for transferring music onto tape cartridges for broadcast were speeded up from 45rpm to 48rpm. This was meant to make for a \"brighter sound\" than the station's main rival, WLS, and meant that since it was faster, more music could be aired. Witz also insisted his on-air personalities broadcast false time checks, in the event listeners might be part of Arbitron ratings households.\n\nJ. R. Russ, who grew up listening to the station, has created a cyber version of WCFL which can be heard on the internet at http://www.wcflchicago.com . Russ has been able to obtain original airchecks, commercials and jingles of the station. TM Productions, the producer of radio station jingles since 1955, waived its licensing fees to assist Russ with his historic project. \"Chickenman\", which originated at WCFL, can also be heard. The cyber station went on the air on Labor Day in 2013.\n\nOn March 15, 1976, after two years of falling ratings, WCFL abruptly dropped its Top 40 format in favor of \"The World's Most Beautiful Music\", leaving WLS as Chicago's only AM Top 40 station. Station management released all disc jockeys who did not have \"no cut\" clauses in their contracts with the official explanation of the format change as \"being more in keeping with the labor movement\". Larry Lujack, still under contract with the station, stayed on at WCFL playing easy listening music until moving back to WLS in September 1976. The easy listening format was already heard in stereo on FM beautiful music stations WLOO and WLAK. By 1978, the easy sounds were replaced by a gold-based adult contemporary format.\n\nAfter deciding its profit margin was too small for the Chicago Federation of Labor to maintain, on April 10, 1978, it was announced that WCFL would be sold to the Mutual Broadcasting System, at the time a subsidiary of the Amway Corporation, for $12 million. The history of the first and longest-lived labor radio station was over; after nearly 52 years, the \"Voice of Labor\" had been stilled. The station began to identify itself as \"Mutual/CFL.\" A magazine-type news/talk format was adopted, with sports talk in the evening hours and the syndicated Larry King Show overnight, but ratings remained low. In 1982, WCFL flipped to a Middle of The Road format playing adult standards and pop hits of the 1950s and '60s mixed in with some softer oldies and AC cuts, and even a few currents. Ratings were still low, so by the end of 1983 WCFL evolved into an Adult Contemporary format.\n\nWCFL and the Chicago Federation of Labor enjoyed the support of Mayor Richard J. Daley throughout his 1955–1976 administration. He proclaimed January 11, 1966 \"WCFL Day in Chicago\" to mark the 40th anniversary of the station. In 1976, when it became evident it was time for the Federation to sell the radio station, Federation President William A. Lee turned to his long-time friend, Mayor Daley, for advice.\n\nIn 1983, WCFL was sold by Mutual to Statewide Broadcasting. Statewide switched WCFL to adult contemporary Christian music about 10 hours a day and teaching programs the rest of the time. WCFL sold brokered programming in 30 minute blocks of time to Christian radio organizations and preachers. The format was profitable but received low ratings. At that time, WCFL advertised its call letters as standing for \"Winning Chicago For The Lord\". In early 1985, the station moved from Marina City into a two-story brick building which had served as the original transmitter building on its Downers Grove transmitter site. Statewide Broadcasting specialized in religious formats but merged with a secular company called Heftel Broadcasting in early 1987. Although no longer in use, the former call letters WCFL, rendered massively in stainless steel, still remain on the exterior wall of the transmitting office, just off 39th Street in Downers Grove.\n\nInitially, WCFL remained religious while its co-owned longtime rock station 97.9 FM WLUP maintained its AOR format. Heftel ended WCFL's religious format just after the stroke of midnight on April 29, 1987. The call letters of the station were changed to WLUP, and its FM sister station became WLUP-FM. WLUP-FM remained an AOR station, while 1000 WLUP switched to a full service rock format focusing on personality, comedy and talk programs with a few rock cuts an hour. After 7 p.m., WLUP and WLUP-FM simulcast the AOR format till dawn. As it concentrated on Spanish radio, Heftel sold its English-language stations, including WLUP-AM-FM; Evergreen Media bought WLUP-AM-FM in 1988. From October 1992 until August 1993, WLUP AM was the first Chicago affiliate for \"The Howard Stern Show\".\n\nInitially, the AM and FM stations remained the same under Evergreen. But on September 27, 1993, WLUP-FM switched to a full-service talk/comedy format, while AM 1000 became all-sports. 97.9 remained WLUP-FM and AM 1000 changed its call sign to WMVP, for \"Most Valuable Player,\" to reflect the station's all-sports programming. WMVP's schedule included some nationally syndicated shows such as \"The Fabulous Sports Babe\" and \"Ferrall On The Bench\" as well as play-by-play of local sports games. Despite broadcasting 24/7, the station trailed in the ratings to (at the time) daytime-only WSCR and to WMAQ's \"Sports Huddle\" at night. WMVP dropped its all sports format at 6 a.m. on June 5, 1996, the day before the Chicago Bulls opened the NBA Finals against the Seattle SuperSonics, and returned to mostly simulcasting WLUP-FM. (WMVP did carry its own night-time sports talk program, and play-by-play broadcasts of the White Sox, Blackhawks and Bulls, and would later air some shows from hosts who were moved over from the FM beginning that September). Evergreen later merged with Chancellor and sold WLUP-FM to Bonneville International in July 1997, with WMVP permanently splitting from the FM. WMVP began airing its own talk/sports format, simply called \"AM 1000.\" In August 1998, WMVP was sold by Chancellor to ABC/Disney, and flipped back to sports on October 12th, this time affiliated with the co-owned ESPN Radio Network.\n\nABC operates WMVP from studios and offices at 190 North State Street in the Chicago Loop, where sister station WLS-TV also has its studios. WMVP also has a streetside studio for local programming right next to WLS's own streetside studios.\n\nOn August 28, 2019, it was announced by ESPN Radio that day-to-day management of the station would move from direct purview by ESPN to a management agreement with Good Karma Brands, a company owned by Craig Karmazin which has had sustained success running ESPN Radio stations to the north in Madison and Milwaukee, along with Cleveland and West Palm Beach, Florida. The current general manager, Jim Pastor, will retire at the end of the year, with Good Karma beginning to operate the station on September 29, 2019 under a lease with Disney (no information about a conversion to an eventual station purchase has been revealed).\n\nThe lease makes WMVP a sister station to GKB's Milwaukee cluster of WTMJ, WKTI and WAUK, and the Madison market's WTLX (WTMJ carries a local news/talk format). No changes to personnel and facilities in the near future are currently expected under the lease agreement.\n\n\n"}

The bridge is situated at the narrowest part of the Danube in the Budapest area, spanning only 290 m. It is named after Elisabeth of Bavaria, a popular queen and empress of Austria-Hungary, who was assassinated in 1898. Today, her large bronze statue sits by the bridge's Buda side connection in the middle of a small garden. \n\nThe original eclectic flamboyant style bridge was built between 1897 and 1903. It was subsequently destroyed during the WW2, and a significantly simplified brutalist version was built without any ornamentation between 1961–1964. \n\nIts two ends are:\n\nThe original permanent crossing, a decorative suspension bridge of chains, was built between 1897 and 1903, amid a corruption scandal. The Buda end of Erzsébet bridge runs directly into the massive foot of Gellért Hill, necessitating a complicated arrangement of roads to connect to the bridge. The bridge was designed in such a way because a wealthy nobleman, a member of the City Council owned the particular area of the riverbank. He wanted to make a fortune by selling the piece of land for bridge construction purposes, bribing the other councilmen and engineers on purpose. He managed to sell the land at greatly inflated prices. In the era of horse-drawn carriages the geometry issue was not considered significant and the resulting cost overruns were covered up, therefore no prosecution took place. In recent decades, many motorists have been permanently injured or killed in the sharp turn that immediately follows the bridgehead. After an accident in 2004, which killed a family, a speed limit of 40 km/h was posted for the west-bound lanes. \n\nThe original Erzsébet Bridge, along with many other bridges all over the country, was blown up at the end of World War II by retreating Wehrmacht sappers. This is the only bridge in Budapest which could not be rebuilt in its original form. Pictures and some salvaged elements from the old bridge can be seen on the grass in front of the Museum of Transport in City Park.\n\nThe currently standing slender white cable bridge was built on the very same location between 1961–1964, because the government could not afford to construct entirely new foundations for the bridge. The main spar cables of the bridge are hexagonal in cross section, composed of thousands of elementary steel wires of seven different diameters, partly because early computers were unable to provide solution for a circular cross section main cable batch.\n\nThe novel design (based on that of Mülheim Bridge, Cologne) designed by Pál Sávoly, was a first in Central Europe and not without weaknesses. BKV tram traffic and its heavy tracks had to be removed from the bridge in 1973 after signs of cracks appeared in the structure.\n\nThe special lighting for Elisabeth Bridge has been created by renowned Japanese lighting designer Motoko Ishii and Japan contributed 120 million forints (EUR 450,000) to the costs. The Budapest City Council has paid 150 million forints for the project. 2009 marks the 140th anniversary of establishing diplomatic links between the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and Japan, and the 50th anniversary of re-establishing diplomatic links between Japan and Hungary.\n\n\n"}

According to CNET and a book by John Hennessy, each server had a novel 12-volt battery to reduce costs and improve power efficiency.\n\nAccording to Google, their global data center operation electrical power ranges between 500 and 681 megawatts.\nThe combined processing power of these servers might have reached from 20 to 100 petaflops in 2008.\n\nDetails of the Google worldwide private networks are not publicly available, but Google publications make references to the \"Atlas Top 10\" report that ranks Google as the third largest ISP behind Level 3.\n\nIn order to run such a large network, with direct connections to as many ISPs as possible at the lowest possible cost, Google has a very open peering policy.\n\nFrom this site, we can see that the Google network can be accessed from 67 public exchange points and 69 different locations across the world. As of May 2012, Google had 882 Gbit/s of public connectivity (not counting private peering agreements that Google has with the largest ISPs). This public network is used to distribute content to Google users as well as to crawl the internet to build its search indexes.\nThe private side of the network is a secret, but a recent disclosure from Google indicate that they use custom built high-radix switch-routers (with a capacity of 128 × 10 Gigabit Ethernet port) for the wide area network. Running no less than two routers per datacenter (for redundancy) we can conclude that the Google network scales in the terabit per second range (with two fully loaded routers the bi-sectional bandwidth amount to 1,280 Gbit/s).\n\nThese custom switch-routers are connected to DWDM devices to interconnect data centers and point of presences (PoP) via dark fibre.\n\nFrom a datacenter view, the network starts at the rack level, where 19-inch racks are custom-made and contain 40 to 80 servers (20 to 40 1U servers on either side, while new servers are 2U rackmount systems. Each rack has an Ethernet switch). Servers are connected via a 1 Gbit/s Ethernet link to the top of rack switch (TOR). TOR switches are then connected to a gigabit cluster switch using multiple gigabit or ten gigabit uplinks. The cluster switches themselves are interconnected and form the datacenter interconnect fabric (most likely using a dragonfly design rather than a classic butterfly or flattened butterfly layout).\n\nFrom an operation standpoint, when a client computer attempts to connect to Google, several DNS servers resolve www.google.com into multiple IP addresses via Round Robin policy. Furthermore, this acts as the first level of load balancing and directs the client to different Google clusters. A Google cluster has thousands of servers, and once the client has connected to the server additional load balancing is done to send the queries to the least loaded web server. This makes Google one of the largest and most complex content delivery networks.\n\nGoogle has numerous data centers scattered around the world. At least 12 significant Google data center installations are located in the United States. The largest known centers are located in The Dalles, Oregon; Atlanta, Georgia; Reston, Virginia; Lenoir, North Carolina; and Moncks Corner, South Carolina. In Europe, the largest known centers are in Eemshaven and Groningen in the Netherlands and Mons, Belgium. Google's Oceania Data Center is claimed to be located in Sydney, Australia.\n\nOne of the largest Google data centers is located in the town of The Dalles, Oregon, on the Columbia River, approximately 80 miles (129 km) from Portland. Codenamed \"Project 02\", the million complex was built in 2006 and is approximately the size of two American football fields, with cooling towers four stories high. The site was chosen to take advantage of inexpensive hydroelectric power, and to tap into the region's large surplus of fiber optic cable, a remnant of the dot-com boom. A blueprint of the site appeared in 2008.\n\nIn February 2009, Stora Enso announced that they had sold the Summa paper mill in Hamina, Finland to Google for 40 million Euros. Google invested 200 million euros on the site to build a data center and announced additional 150 million euro investment in 2012. Google chose this location due to the availability and proximity of renewable energy sources.\n\nIn 2005, Google was researching a containerized modular data center. Google filed a patent application for this technology in 2003.\n\nIn 2013, the press revealed the existence of Google's floating data centers along the coasts of the states of California (Treasure Island's Building 3) and Maine. The development project was maintained under tight secrecy. The data centers are 250 feet long, 72 feet wide, 16 feet deep. The patent for an in-ocean data center cooling technology was bought by Google in 2009 (along with a wave-powered ship-based data center patent in 2008). Shortly thereafter, Google declared that the two massive and secretly-built infrastructures were merely \"interactive learning centers, [...] a space where people can learn about new technology.\"\n\nGoogle halted work on the barges in late 2013 and began selling off the barges in 2014.\n\nMost of the software stack that Google uses on their servers was developed in-house. According to a well-known Google employee, C++, Java, Python and (more recently) Go are favored over other programming languages. For example, the back end of Gmail is written in Java and the back end of Google Search is written in C++. Google has acknowledged that Python has played an important role from the beginning, and that it continues to do so as the system grows and evolves.\n\nThe software that runs the Google infrastructure includes:\n\nGoogle has developed several abstractions which it uses for storing most of its data:\n\nMost operations are read-only. When an update is required, queries are redirected to other servers, so as to simplify consistency issues. Queries are divided into sub-queries, where those sub-queries may be sent to different ducts in parallel, thus reducing the latency time.\n\nTo lessen the effects of unavoidable hardware failure, software is designed to be fault tolerant. Thus, when a system goes down, data is still available on other servers, which increases reliability.\n\nLike most search engines, Google indexes documents by building a data structure known as inverted index. Such an index obtains a list of documents by a query word. The index is very large due to the number of documents stored in the servers.\n\nThe index is partitioned by document IDs into many pieces called shards. Each shard is replicated onto multiple servers. Initially, the index was being served from hard disk drives, as is done in traditional information retrieval (IR) systems. Google dealt with the increasing query volume by increasing number of replicas of each shard and thus increasing number of servers. Soon they found that they had enough servers to keep a copy of the whole index in main memory (although with low replication or no replication at all), and in early 2001 Google switched to an \"in-memory index\" system. This switch \"radically changed many design parameters\" of their search system, and allowed for a significant increase in throughput and a large decrease in latency of queries.\n\nIn June 2010, Google rolled out a next-generation indexing and serving system called \"Caffeine\" which can continuously crawl and update the search index. Previously, Google updated its search index in batches using a series of MapReduce jobs. The index was separated into several layers, some of which were updated faster than the others, and the main layer wouldn't be updated for as long as two weeks. With Caffeine, the entire index is updated incrementally on a continuous basis. Later Google revealed a distributed data processing system called \"Percolator\" which is said to be the basis of Caffeine indexing system.\n\nGoogle's server infrastructure is divided into several types, each assigned to a different purpose:\n\nIn October 2013, \"The Washington Post\" reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Google's data centers, as part of a program named MUSCULAR. This wiretapping was made possible because Google did not encrypt data passed inside its own network. Google began encrypting data sent between data centers in 2013.\n\nGoogle's most efficient data center runs at using only fresh air cooling, requiring no electrically powered air conditioning.\n\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google \"the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".\n\n\n"}

He was best known for his work in the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling. Okerlund was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006 by Hulk Hogan. He was signed to a lifetime contract with WWE and worked for promotional programs, mostly WWE Network programming and, occasionally, the TV series.\n\nAfter studying broadcast journalism at the University of Nebraska (Lincoln), Okerlund landed a job as a disc jockey at KOIL, a popular radio station in Omaha, Nebraska. Okerlund later moved to Minneapolis where he worked for WDGY as a radio host under the alias of Gene Leader. He later left that position to become Program Director at KDWB. Okerlund also worked in Minneapolis for a local television station in the front office.\n\nOkerlund fronted the band Gene Caroll and the Shades releasing \"Is It Ever Gonna Happen\" on the album \"In This Corner\" Norton Records in 1962.\n\nOkerlund left the radio industry for a position at the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1970, where he occasionally filled in for ailing ring announcer and interviewer Marty O'Neill, eventually becoming O'Neill's permanent replacement by the end of the decade.\n\nHe stayed with the AWA until the end of 1983, when he was one of many AWA personnel to join the expanding World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He stayed with the WWF for nine years as their top interviewer and was host of such WWF shows as \"All-American Wrestling\" and \"Tuesday Night Titans\".\n\nIn 1984, Okerlund and Hulk Hogan faced Mr. Fuji and George Steele in Minneapolis. He was supposed to stay on the apron and let Hogan fight, but when Hogan gave him a high five, the referee mistook it for a tag. Okerlund had to go in, but before his opponent touched him, he quickly got out of the way and tagged Hogan back in. Okerlund pinned Mr. Fuji for the victory.\n\nOkerlund was also part of one of the most infamous bloopers in professional wrestling history at SummerSlam in 1989. Okerlund was set to interview WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude and Rude's manager Bobby Heenan prior to Rude's title defense against The Ultimate Warrior when the SummerSlam backdrop fell backwards. The shot of the SummerSlam backdrop falling can be seen in the video induction of Mean Gene at the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006. Okerlund then turned around and said, \"Fuck it,\" along with some other words with no audio. The cameras then cut away to a live shot of the crowd, with play-by-play announcer Tony Schiavone and color commentator Jesse Ventura attempting to restore order. After a short while, Okerlund's interview with Rude and Heenan went as planned. According to a shoot interview with Okerlund, conducted by RF Video, the SummerSlam blooper was actually taped beforehand. Okerlund explained that the wrong tape was aired during the live broadcast. Meanwhile, a frantic Vince McMahon was on a headset instructing Ventura to cover for Okerlund. Ventura instead made fun of Okerlund's on-air gaffe and jokingly regarded Okerlund as a \"troublemaker.\"\n\nOkerlund appeared at SummerSlam 1993 and made his final WWF appearance of the 1990s on the September 18, 1993 edition of \"Superstars\". He then left the WWF entirely when his contract expired. He stated in an RF shoot interview, that although he probably could have re-negotiated a new contract, he was never actually offered one, thus opting to become an interviewer for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He claimed at the time of his hiring with WCW that he had not been on speaking terms with McMahon for the past few years he was working in the WWF.\n\nHe debuted on the November 6, 1993 edition of \"WCW Saturday Night\". Three years later, his contract with WCW expired and he was off television for two months in the fall of 1996. His last appearance for a time was at WCW Fall Brawl on September 15, 1996. Okerlund had talks with the WWF during this time, however, they could not come to terms. Mike Tenay took over Special Interviews and the Pay Per View Reports. Okerlund signed a new contract with WCW and returned on the November 11, 1996 edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\". Okerlund wrestled twice in WCW. The first was in mid-2000 when he and Buff Bagwell faced Chris Kanyon and fellow announcer Mark Madden, with Bagwell and Okerlund winning. However, Madden wanted Okerlund back in the ring the next week in a one on one match-up. The two did wrestle again and Okerlund won the match with the assistance of Pamela Paulshock. After that, he was with WCW until January 2001.\n\nShortly before WWF's purchase of WCW in 2001, Okerlund rejoined his old promotion (renamed WWE in 2002). His first assignment back with WWF was the Gimmick Battle Royal during WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, 2001, along with Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan. He hosted \"WWE Confidential\" in 2002, which lasted for two years. Okerlund also hosted \"WWE Madison Square Garden Classics\", a weekly series, airing on the MSG Network, featuring classic WWE matches that took place at Madison Square Garden from the last four decades. He's also the host for the WWE Classics On Demand Hall of Fame section, which takes a look at a different WWE Hall of Famer each month.\n\nOkerlund was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006, by Hulk Hogan.\n\nIn June 2008, Okerlund began hosting \"WWE Vintage Collection\", a program which showcases archive footage from the extensive WWE video library. Okerlund conducted the interviews on the three-hour \"Old School\" episode of \"Raw\" on November 15, 2010, where he interviewed John Cena, Randy Orton, members of The Nexus and Mae Young in similar fashion as to how interviews were done in the 1980s. Okerlund also appeared in a few Old School merchandising segments, promoting WWE's new Old School merchandise line.\n\nOn April 10, 2012, during the \"WWE Smackdown: Blast from the Past\", Okerlund teamed with World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, in a winning effort, against the team of Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio. On the December 17, 2012 edition of \"WWE Raw\", Okerlund appeared alongside Jim Ross and Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat to announce the winner of the Slammy Award for \"Match of the Year\". On March 4, 2013, Okerlund appeared at the second \"Old School Raw\" for Mae Young's 90th birthday party which was interrupted later by CM Punk. On January 7, 2014, Okerlund made an appearance at the third \"Old School Raw\", in which he made references to the premium rate \"wrestling hotlines\" of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn November 2016, Okerlund became the narrator for the WWE Network original animated series \"WWE Story Time\".\n\nOn January 22, 2018 at \"Raw 25 Years\", Okerlund made his final WWE appearance where he interviewed AJ Styles.\n\nOn November 12, 1985, Okerlund, along with Hulk Hogan, Bobby Heenan, Ricky Steamboat, Davey Boy Smith, Corporal Kirchner, Dynamite Kid and Big John Studd, appeared on \"The A-Team\".\n\nOkerlund was one of the professional wrestling legends on the WWE Network's show \"Legends' House\".\n\nOkerlund appeared as a \"Celebrity Prognosticator\" on ESPN Radio's \"The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz\" on November 27, 2013.\n\nIn 2018, Okerlund appeared in a Mountain Dew Kickstart commercial featuring Kevin Hart who during the commercial semi-impersonated Randy Savage.\n\nHe made an appearance at the WrestleCade 2018 weekend event that took place November 23–25, 2018 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nForming a band in his high school days, \"Gene Carroll & The Shades\" were based out of Sisseton, South Dakota, recording a single in 1959 \"Red Devil / Do You Remember\" (M&L 1001). A second single was released in 1962 \"Is It Ever Gonna Happen / Holly\" (Wausau C-1100) as \"Gene Carroll\". They played parties throughout the Midwest and the Dakotas, and in 2009 were inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Music Association's Hall of Fame.\n\nIn his AWA days, Okerlund was given the nickname \"Mean Gene\" by Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura – an irony, considering that throughout the years many wrestlers and promotion staff considered Okerlund the friendliest person in the game. Okerlund was close friends with Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik and the late Bobby Heenan. Okerlund served as best man at the Iron Sheik's wedding.\n\nHis name has been associated with fast food concept, Mean Gene's Burgers, the brainchild of food-distributor Orion Food Systems (headed by two of Okerlund's nephews), which appeared on college campuses including Duke University and West Virginia University, as well as Mean Gene's Pizza, a chain of pizzerias located within bowling alleys. Mean Gene's Burgers locations are also located at select overseas US Navy base eatery locations (e.g. United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka). These are owned by Hot Stuff Foods, which was headed by two of his nephews. Early in 2006, Okerlund and Hot Stuff split. Okerlund and one of the nephews were planning to start their own food company on the brands, but Hot Stuff sued, claiming they had \"Mean Gene\" trademarked. Okerlund lost, with the judge saying that Okerlund can't use the name \"Mean Gene\" for his new food company. Okerlund succeeded in canceling the trademark registrations held by Orion, but remained enjoined from competing with Orion for the remainder of his life.\n\nOkerlund had been married to his wife Jeanne since March 27, 1964 and had two sons and three grandsons. His son Todd starred on the University of Minnesota ice hockey team from 1983 to 1987. Todd played on the 1988 United States Olympics team that competed in Calgary. He played four games with the NHL's New York Islanders. A chronic knee injury ultimately forced his early retirement.\n\nIn his later years, Okerlund suffered from polycystic kidney disease.\n\nOkerlund, who was a heavy drinker for most of his adult life, had received three kidney transplants. His first was in 1995 and his second in 2004, the latter of which he received from his wife.\n\nOkerlund died on the morning of January 2, 2019, at the age of 76 in a Sarasota, Florida hospital. This was later confirmed on WWE social media and its official website later that day. It was revealed by his son, Todd Okerlund, that he had received three kidney transplants and had suffered a fall which caused his health to deteriorate in the weeks leading up to his death. Condolences were sent by fellow WWE superstars and alumni on all social media including Triple H, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Iron Sheik, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, among many others.\n\n\n"}

He served as Chief of the Navy from 1952 to 1972 and Chief of the South African Defence Force from 1972 until 1976, the only naval officer to have served in the post.\n\nBiermann's father, also named Hugo Hendrick, joined the Orange Free State postal service at the age of 12, and later joined the South African Railways and Harbours as a telegraphist. Born in Johannesburg on 6 August 1916, Biermann was one of four children. His brothers Phillip and Stefanus (Chips) served on whalecatchers that had been converted to minesweepers during the Second World War. His brother Stefanus reached the rank of rear admiral in the South African Navy. Biermann started school in the Transvaal until his father was transferred to Cape Town. He completed his schooling at Jan van Riebeeck High School and, after leaving school at the age of 16, joined the South African Training Ship \"General Botha\".\n\nAfter two years training on the \"General Botha\" from 1932 to 1933, Biermann entered the British Merchant Navy as a cadet and served until 1938, when he was transferred to the Maritime Department of the South African Railways and Harbours.\n\nBiermann began his naval career in 1938 as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In January 1940, he was called up for full-time service and transferred to the Seaward Defence Force. Promoted lieutenant in mid 1941 he commanded ,\n\nThe crew of the HMSAS \"Gamtoos\" cleared several Mediterranean ports of sunken and scuttled ships, and at Marseilles, Biermann blew a hole in the harbour wall so that he could enter the Vieux Port and begin work. The \"Gamtoos\" went on to salvage the \"Sidi Aissa\", towing it away to clear the valuable graving dock at La Ciotat by 14 December 1944. This earned Biermann appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The citation for his OBE reads:\nAfter the Second World War, and with the establishment of the South African Navy (Permanent Force) in May 1946, Biermann was appointed lieutenant commander in the Permanent Force and made captain of the Algerine class minesweeper, , commissioning it in Devonport on 8 September 1947. He was also the Senior Officer of the minesweeping squadron.\n\nIn 1950, Biermann was transferred to Defence Headquarters and served on the staff of the then Director-General of the South African Naval Forces. Two years later he attended the British Naval Staff Course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and was appointed as naval attaché at South African House, London with the rank of commander.\n\nMinister Frans Erasmus embarked on a process of ridding the Defence Force of officers associated with the Smuts government and replacing them with others whom he considered more Nationalist, one which Afrikaners would feel more at home. In 1952, Erasmus posted Brigadier Pieter de Waal as a Military attache to the United States, replacing him with Biermann, one of only seven Afrikaans officers in the navy in 1948. Then Commander Biermann was appointed Naval and Marine Chief of Staff (the head of the navy) on 1 December 1952 and promoted to the rank of commodore, jumping two ranks. During his tenure the Simonstown Agreement was signed on 30 June 1955. He held commodore rank until 1 April 1957, with the handing over of the Simon's Town Naval Base, he was promoted to rear admiral. Biermann was made vice admiral on 1 December 1965, when his position was simultaneously retitled as Chief of the Navy.\n\nIn 1972, Biermann took over the position of Commandant General of the South African Defence Force and promoted to admiral, the first time this rank was used in the South African Navy. The title was changed to Chief of the South African Defence Force a year later.\n\nIn 1977, Biermann authored \"'The South African Response. The Southern Oceans and the Security of the Free World: New Studies in Global Strategy\".\n\nThe navy's submarine base was named after him.\n\nFollowing the success of Bruce Dalling and the yacht Voortrekker in the 1968 Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, Biermann, then chairman of the Springbok Ocean Racing Trust, suggested that South Africa host an ocean race of its own.\n\nThe South African Ocean Racing Trust (as the SAORT became known) selected the Iate Clube do Rio de Janeiro, who were willing to co-operate in the organising of the race and the race would be known as the Cape to Rio. The first race was organised for 1971, with the organisers anticipating at most 15 entries into the race. However, the race attracted a large amount of interest and 58 boats entered the 1971 race.\n\nBiermann received the Star of South Africa on 13 May 1960 in recognition of his exceptionally meritorious services. He was also appointed Grand Cross of Naval Merit of the Order of May from Admiral Guillermo Brown of Argentina, and the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Infante Dom Henrique of Portugal. He was the first recipient of the Southern Cross Decoration, which he received upon his retirement as Chief of the South African Defence Force in 1976.\n\nIn 1940, Biermann married Margaret (Peggy) Cruyws. She died in 2008 at the age of 90. The couple had two children, Hugo Hendrik and Diana.\nBiermann died on 27 March 2012 at the age of 95 in a retirement home, Silvermine Village, near Cape Town.

{"id": "2030624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030624", "title": "Muhanna Al-Dura", "text": "Muhanna Al-Dura\n\nMuhanna Durra (), , is a Jordanian painter widely regarded as a pioneer of the Jordanian Arts Movement and for being the first to introduce Cubism and abstract art into the Jordanian visual arts community. He is a professor at the Faculty of Fine Art and Design at University of Jordan and serves as the President of the Jordan Association of Fine Arts.\n\nBorn in Amman, Jordan in 1938 to a Lebanese father and a Turkish mother, Al-Dura was raised in a striking red hilltop villa in downtown Amman. The house is only a few blocks away from Amman's popular tourist attraction, the Roman amphitheater, and is commonly believed to rest atop an ancient Roman cemetery. As a child, spooky folklore about his neighborhood sparked a fascination with ghouls and \"ignited fantasy in what was beyond the observable, physical world.\" \n\nA notoriously rebellious youth with a penchant for drawing, he was sent by his father to study art with George Allief (also known as \"George Aleef\"), a former Russian officer with the Tsarist army. Allief taught him the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective. These lessons with Allief marked the young artist's transition from childhood drawing to the disciplined work of a professional artist. According to Dura's memoirs, Allief taught his students to meticuoulsy render a matchbox as an exercise in perspective. \n\nFollowing the formative years with Allief, the young Muhanna met Dutch painter, William Hallowin, who introduced him to Rembrandt and the Dutch school which sparked an obsession with the power of light. In 1954, he was sent to the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome to become the first Jordanian to receive a formal art education. He claims to have been disillusioned by the academy and committed himself to studying the classics through art in museums and churches. After graduating in 1958, Durra returned to Amman to teach history of art at the Teachers' Training College. In 1964, Durra established the Fine Arts Section at the Department of Culture and Art, Amman, and then established the Jordan Institute of Fine Arts in 1970. \n\nBetween 1960 and 1970, Al-Durra returned to Rome, where he experimented with abstraction and cubism. In 1970, he returned to Jordan to receive the Kawkab Decoration from King Hussein. Around that time, Durra established an art studio; the first Jordanian to establish an art studio to teach local students. Among his notable students was the Princess Wijdan Ali who is best known for her attempts to revive the traditions of Islamic art. Another student was Nawal Abdallah, who is one of the leading lights of Jordan's contemporary arts scene.\n\nDurra is best known for his portraits and also for the way he treated shifting masses of colour. He is also acknowledged as the first artist to introduce cubism and abstract art to the Jordanian arts community. \n\nSelect list of paintings\n\n\nDurra served as a diplomat in Italy, Tunisia, Egypt and later Russia, as Ambassador to the Arab League in Moscow.\n\nIn 2002 the Postal Authorities of Jordan issued a 200 fils postage stamp in honor of Mohanna Durra displaying one of his paintings.\n\nIn November 2006 the Ministry of Culture named an art gallery after Muhanna Durra, and held a national symposium about his art with the participation of prominent Jordanian artists and critics.\n\nOther awards include:\n\n\nDurra held numerous solo exhibitions in Rome, Florence, the USSR, various Arab and European capitals, Washington D.C., Plazzo Venezia, the 1988 Venice Biennale Exhibition, and the Fine Arts National Museum of Valletta, Malta. He later held solo exhibitions in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, the Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts and the Austrian Parliament Central Hall in Vienna. In 2000, \"Muhanna Forever: Pioneer of Modern Art in Jordan\" was exhibited at the Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts and in 2006, he had a solo show at Lines Gallery, Amman, Jordan.\n\nDurra's work is represented in various national and international collections, including that of the Vatican, the Imperial Court of Japan, the President of the Philippines, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau of Canada, David Rockefeller, The Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Fannie Mae Bank in Washington, D.C., Bonn City Hall, Washington, D.C.

{"id": "2030627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030627", "title": "Florence Court", "text": "Florence Court\n\nFlorence Court is a large 18th-century house and estate located 8 miles south-west of Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. It is set in the foothills of Cuilcagh Mountain. The nearby village is distinguished by the one-word name Florencecourt. It is owned and managed by the National Trust and is the sister property of nearby Castle Coole. The other National Trust property in County Fermanagh is the Crom Estate.\n\nThe history of the building of Florence Court is subject to conjecture and the current house was built in at least two, if not three, phases. The first house on the site was built by John Cole, Esq. (1680–1726) and named after his wife Florence Bourchier Wrey (died 1718). She was the daughter of Sir Bourchier Wrey, 4th Baronet (c. 1653–1696) of Tawstock, Devon. An anonymous history of Fermanagh written in 1718 describes John Cole's house as being 'very costly and sumptuous' but in 1739 Rev. William Henry described this building as being 'but small, being only the left wing of a grand building, designed by Mr Cole, which he did not live to execute'.\n\nThe architects of the current house are unknown. The central block was built first and various dates from 1730 to 1764 are proffered for its construction. It has been attributed to the German architect Richard Cassels (or Castle) who worked at nearby Castle Hulme in 1728-9 and Florence Court shares similarities with some of Cassels' other Irish houses. An estate map of 1768 shows the central block, standing alone, as having a heavily framed oculus window (in place of the current pair of windows and large, squat niche) on the second floor. This was a recurring device in Cassels' work. Were Cassels involved, dating the initial phase of building to 1730 may be plausible. On the other hand, Mr Henry's account nine years later does not mention there being a new house, lately built. Rowan suggests the plans could have been drawn up by Cassels, but not executed until a much later date, pointing to the 'old fashioned' style of the house; and reflects that 'the design, for all its charm, is far too gauche for [Cassels]'.\n\nThe baroque plasterwork in the library and study at the front of the house appear to date from an earlier period to the rich rococo plasterwork in the dining room, drawing room and stair hall on the western side of the house, and the floorboards in these two rooms differ in width from those elsewhere in the house. It is conjectured that the central block may have been completed in two phases, with the rooms at the back of the house, along with the Venetian room, finished by 1764, when John Cole's son, Lord Mount Florence, held a famous housewarming party.\n\nThe colonnades and pavilions were built c. 1771 and are attributed to the Italian engineer and architect Davis Ducart. These are built of dressed sandstone as opposed to the rendered limestone rubble of the central block. The south and stable yards are by the mason Andrew Lambert. The Introduction to the Enniskillen Papers proposes there may have been an addition stage to completing the front we know today, pointing out that the heavily rusticated window dressings may have been 'an afterthought by another, less accomplished hand'. They do not feature on the facade shown on the 1768 estate map; the introduction suggests further work may have been 'a vain attempt to harmonise [the central block] with the sophisticated cut-stone of the links and pavilions'.\n\nWhether there was a final phase is a matter of conjecture. The 1979 National Trust guidebook points out the similarity between the unusual pedimented doorcase at Florence Court with the doorcase of the now ruinous Nixon Hall at nearby Gransha (built c. 1780). Major improvements were made on the estate c. 1778–80. These included the landscaping of the park by William King and his laying out of the new drive, and the building of the Grand Gates.\n\nFlorence Court was the seat of the Earls of Enniskillen until 1973. The 5th Earl of Enniskillen transferred the house and fourteen acres surrounding it to the National Trust in 1953. In 1955 a devastating fire destroyed the upper floors of the house. Sir Albert Richardson was entrusted with leading the National Trust's restoration and extensive efforts have since returned Florence Court to much of its former glory. Some rooms on the upper floors, however, remain closed.\n\nThe house features exquisite Rococo decoration and fine Irish furniture, many pieces of which were acquired for the property by the National Trust and others loaned from other Irish houses. The majority of the original furnishings were removed when the Cole family moved to Perthshire in 1973 but many were returned at the bequest of the Dowager Countess of Enniskillen on her death in 1998.\n\nThe expansive pleasure garden was landscaped in the mid-19th century, with panoramic views of Benaughlin and Cuilcagh mountains. It features Victorian specimen trees and displays of both temperate and semi-tropical plants, principally rhododendrons.\n\nAlso known as the heather house. The present structure is a reconstruction of an 18th-century thatched summer house. It is located on a prominent spot at the top of the pleasure garden, with views of the garden and Benaughlin mountain.\n\nThe structure was rebuilt by the National Trust in the late-1980s to designs based on 19th-century photographs of the feature. The foundation and cobbled floor are the only parts of the 18th-century structure that remain. In 2015 the summer house was burnt to the ground by vandals. It was rebuilt in 2016, with a significant proportion of the funding for the project raised from the local community.\n\nThe most notable tree on the estate is the Florence Court Yew. This specimen is survivor of the two original Irish Yew (\"Taxus baccata\" 'fastigiata') saplings discovered in 1767 by local farmer George Willis on Cuilcagh mountain. As the Irish Yew can be propagated only from cuttings, this tree is the progenitor of almost all Irish Yews worldwide.\n\nThe yew is located within the site of the John Cole's early 18th-century gardens, approximately one mile southeast of the house. These formerly extensive gardens are now largely lost with the exception of the surviving remains of the 18th-century rock garden, located opposite the yew. The rock garden formerly contained stone tables and chairs but is currently overgrown.\n\nThe four acre walled garden was laid out in the 18th-century and extended in the 1870s by Charlotte, Countess of Enniskillen. It features a rose garden, two ponds, orchards of heirloom variety fruit trees and a working vegetable garden. The 1870s Rose Cottage on the western edge of the garden was formerly the head gardener's dwelling. It was restored from a derelict condition in the 1990s and is now let as a holiday cottage. In September 2017 a National Trust project to restore the garden to its 1930s condition was awarded a grant by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project includes plans to rebuild two long glass houses that formerly ran along the length of the north wall.\n\nThe tennis courts behind the north wall were replaced by Forestry Service offices in the 1970s.\n\nAn 18th-century cottage built from bamboo was formerly located west of the house. It served as a tea house but fell into disrepair during the second half of the 20th century and was demolished in the 1970s.\n\nThe Lady Well is a natural spring well located approximately three quarters of a mile east of the house at the bottom of the Broad Meadow.\n\nThe 18th-century landscaped park is framed by Benauglin and Cuilcagh mountains. It was laid out c. 1778–80 by William King for the 1st Earl. King's work included the present undulating main drive, replacing the earlier straight east avenue which ran from the centre of the main front of the house. The path of the original drive remains visible on aerial photographs.\n\nThe Larganess and Finglass rivers flow through the estate, most of which is occupied by pasture and forestry, principally Larch. The Glen Wood nature reserve is a semi-natural oak woodland conserved by the Forestry Service near to the old deer park on the southwest edge of the demesne.\n\nThe Grand Gates date from c. 1778. They are flanked by a pair of symmetrical bay fronted lodges with hipped roofs facing the road and gables to the rear. Each comprises a single room. The current double sash windows were installed in the 1920s, replacing the original square Georgian glazing. The original chimney stacks have been demolished and the walls of the lodges, which were originally harled, are now rendered and painted. For many years the gates were painted red but are now black.\n\nThe south lodge is a picturesque one and a half story cottage built to replace an earlier lodge in the 1870s. The cottage is three bays wide with a front gabled porch, built from coursed rubble with dressed sandstone door and window surrounds. Quatrefoil bargeboards decorate the porch and side gables. The original sash windows have been replaced by simple modern glazing.\n\nThe Old Gate lodge at the end of the north avenue was built c. 1800. It was originally a single story three bay cottage, later extended to its present T plan.\n\nA working water-powered sawmill stands on the edge of the pleasure garden. It includes an exhibition on the history of the building, the timber industry on the estate and the mid-1980s restoration of the building and machinery. The water wheel has the name 'William Maxwell circa 1848' at its centre although who Maxwell was is obscure. The machinery includes the original mid-19th century water-powered saw and two early-20th century electrical saws. Behind the mill is the millpond and the rebuilt millrace. The headrace runs off the Larganess river and is approximately one and a half miles long.\n\nThe main part of the building is built of limestone rubble and dates to the 18th century. It was extended and converted to a sawmill in the 1840s. A brick extension housing an office was added later in the 19th century. The building's original use is unknown although several long vertical apertures along each side of the building have the appearance of gun loops and may indicate the building had an earlier military function, possibly as a barracks.\n\nIn the vicinity of the sawmill are a restored carpenter's workshop and cottage. Items including wheels, furniture and coffins were made here for both the estate and the local area.\n\nNear to the sawmill is a working Victorian hydraulic ram. It uses water pressure from the millpond to generate enough force to pump water uphill to the house. The hydraulic ram was replaced as the house's water supply following connection to mains water in the 1950s and now pumps into the millrace.\n\nThe Eel house is a single-arched 18th-century bridge crossing the Larganess river, located at the southwest corner of the pleasure garden. The bridge passes close to two small fords which slow the river at this point. Eel was formerly abundant in the Larganess and traps were set across the river here as it was an optimal place to catch them. The resulting catch was stored in the room behind the opening to the left of the arch.\n\nBehind the cattle yard is a preserved 18th century forge still used occasionally for demonstrations.\n\nIn the 1850s the 3rd Earl set up Florencecourt Tilery to provide local employment, utilising rich clay deposits in the vicinity of the Arney River. The works were located approximately two miles northeast of the estate and remained open until the deposits were worked out in the early 20th-century. The principal items manufactured were bricks, water pipes, roof tiles and hollow insulated floor tiles, similar to Roman hypocaust tiles. The floor tiles were commonly used in the kitchens of dwellings in surrounding areas, whilst the roof tiles appear to have been used only for outbuildings. The use of these materials is a distinctive feature of the vernacular architecture of southwest Fermanagh, otherwise rare and possibly unique in Irish vernacular architecture of the period.\n\nEarly on the morning of 22 March 1955, a fire broke out on the first floor landing at Florence Court, adjacent to Lady Enniskillen's bedroom. Whilst fire brigades almost had control of the fire by 9am, dry weather conditions helped re-ignite the blaze. Flames reached the roof of the building which crashed down into the hall, so that by the evening around two-thirds of the Florence Court interior lay in ruins.\n\nLady Enniskillen, born Mary Cicely Nevill (daughter of Hugh Nevill), discovered the fire, which broke out during one of her husband's rare absences from home. After rushing downstairs to the servant's quarters to raise the alarm, she went to nearby Killymanamly House to telephone the elderly 5th Earl of Enniskillen (1876–1963), who was at the Ulster Club in Belfast, to tell him that the house was on fire. He is said to have cried \"What the hell do you think I can do about it?\".\n\nMuch of the damage to the interior of Florence Court was caused by the gallons of water pumped onto the flames. The dining room, with its exquisite plasterwork decoration, was saved only by the prompt action of local builders Bertie Pierce and Ned Vaughan who, on the instructions of Viola Grosvenor, later the Duchess of Westminster, drilled six holes in the flat part of the ceiling to allow the water which had accumulated on the floor above to quickly drain away and thereby preventing ceiling collapse. Two of these holes are still evident in the dining room today.\n\nThe fire was only one of a series of events in the 1950s and 60s at Florence Court which marked the end of an era for the house and family. Following World War II falling agricultural prices, rising wage costs, death duties and a drastic reduction of the size of the demesne, the lifestyle of the 5th Earl of Enniskillen and his second wife Mary (née Nevill), was increasingly difficult to sustain. To secure the long-term future of the house, Lord Enniskillen gave Florence Court to the National Trust in 1953. It was opened to the public the following year.\n\nIn 1956, the 5th Lord Enniskillen's only son and heir Michael, Viscount Cole, died suddenly aged 36; he was unmarried. In 1961, as the restoration of the house was nearing completion, Hurricane Debbie devastated the estate. In 1963, the 5th Lord Enniskillen and his wife, Lady Enniskillen, died within three months of each other.\n\nThe 5th Earl, upon his death, was succeeded by his nephew, Captain David Lowry Cole, M.B.E. (1918–1989), in 1963, who became The Rt. Hon. The 6th Earl of Enniskillen. David Enniskillen (as he was popularly known) had spent much of his life in the Colony of Kenya, having been elected a member of the Legislative Council of Kenya in the early 1960s, just before independence. In 1955, he was divorced from his first wife Sonia (née Syers), stepdaughter of his uncle the 5th Earl (who died in 1963 with his wife, Sonia's mother). By her, he had issue: one son and one daughter.\n\nDavid Enniskillen and his second wife, Nancy, Countess of Enniskillen (née Nancy MacLennan; formerly a diplomat with the United States Foreign Service), moved back to Florence Court, living there from 1964 until 1973. In that year, in the early years of The Troubles, the Earl and Countess of Enniskillen left Florence Court, moving over to Kinloch House in Kinloch, Perthshire, in Britain. David Enniskillen thus became the last Earl of Enniskillen to actually live in Florence Court. He was succeeded by his only son Andrew, who became The 7th Earl of Enniskillen in 1989. Andrew Enniskillen continues to live on a vast estate in Kenya.\n\nDuring the spring of 2012, the BBC filmed parts of \"Blandings\", a television comedy, at Florence Court. Most of the series, however, was filmed at Crom Castle. The series was first broadcast on BBC 1 during January and February 2013.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He co-founded the Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) and later founded the Freedom Front (now Freedom Front Plus). He is partly credited with having prevented the outbreak of armed violence by disaffected white South Africans prior to post-apartheid general elections.\n\nViljoen matriculated at Standerton High School in 1951. He joined South Africa's pre-republic Union Defence Force in 1956 upon receiving a degree in military science at the University of Pretoria. By 1974, Viljoen had been named the South African Army's Director of General Operations, subsequently serving as the Principal Staff Officer to the Chief of the South African Defence Force. He was appointed as Chief of the Army in 1977 and succeeded General Magnus Malan as Chief of the South African Defence Force in 1980.\n\nViljoen was the senior SADF military officer directing Operation Savannah in 1975. He is also credited with having planned the first major airborne assault in South African military history, Cassinga, a raid carried out against SWAPO insurgents. Despite his rank, Viljoen was present during the battle, offering what was described as a \"swashbuckling\" front-line leadership, which won him the respect of many fellow Afrikaners.\n\nViljoen is credited by some with having made overtures which helped lead to white South Africans' acceptance of universal suffrage and free elections, such as with his famous speech at the Broederbond annual assembly in Voortrekkerhoogte, saying of the Black South Africans in his army, \"\"As hulle kan veg vir Suid-Afrika, kan hulle stem vir Suid-Afrika!\"\" (Afrikaans: \"If they can fight for South Africa, then they can vote for South Africa!\").\n\nIn 1993, Viljoen and fellow retired generals formed the Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front), an umbrella body for conservative Afrikaners. However, Viljoen reportedly had strained relationships with the leaders of other right-wing parties, who considered him too moderate.\n\nImmediately prior to the 1994 general elections Viljoen had a force of between 50,000 and 60,000 trained paramilitary personnel at his command, with the ability to seize large sections of the country. The force was assembled in preparation for war with Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the African National Congress (ANC), as a potential contingency to protect Afrikaner interests.\n\nIn March 1994, Viljoen led an effort by several thousand Volksfront militia to protect the bantustan president, Lucas Mangope, in Bophuthatswana against a coup d'état. Despite being requested not to participate in the action because of extremist views, militants of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging also advanced into Bophuthatswana, sparking clashes with the security forces.\n\nImmediately after the incident, Viljoen split from the Volksfront and initiated a legitimate election campaign, co-founding and becoming leader of the Freedom Front (\"Vryheidsfront\"), a new political party representing white conservatives. His decision to take part in the elections is believed to have prevented armed resistance by the far right and on the occasion of his retirement from politics, the South African government recognised him for preventing bloodshed.\n\nViljoen's decision was at least partly influenced by the mediation of his identical twin brother, Abraham Viljoen (Braam), who was an anti-apartheid activist while his brother led the military.\n\nIn the 1994 general election, the Freedom Front, under the leadership of Viljoen, received 2.2% of the national vote and nine seats in the National Assembly. It became the strongest party outside Nelson Mandela's Government of National Unity. Although his supporters were at odds with the government and the ANC, Viljoen praised Mandela on the occasion of his retreat from politics in 1999, even ending his Parliamentary speech speaking in Mandela's native language, Xhosa: \"Go rest in peace. Go rest in the shadow of a tree at your home\".\n\nIn 2001, Viljoen handed over the leadership of the Freedom Front to Pieter Mulder and retired from politics, citing his frustration working with a parliament dominated by the ANC.\n\nIn 2003, it emerged that Viljoen had been a target of the Boeremag paramilitary right-wing group, which considered him a traitor who had underhandedly sold out the Afrikaner people.\n\nIn 2008 Viljoen, aged 74, put up what was described as a spirited fight against two would-be muggers, who were subsequently arrested.\n\nCurrent Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald announced on 3 April 2020 that Viljoen had died on his farm in Ohrigstad, Limpopo. He was 86 and was surrounded by his children. Viljoen died of natural causes.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Christina Susanna Heckroodt, four sons and a daughter.\n\n"}

She was the daughter of architect, Sharif Fawwaz Muhana and his wife, Sharifa Nafi'a bint Jamil Ali. Both her parents could trace their ancestry to the Prophet Mohammed, which allowed her to be given the title of \"Sharifa\".\n\nIn 1962, she joined the Foreign Office of the United Nations in Jordan, shortly after completing her B.A. in Middle Eastern history from Beirut University College (1961), now the Lebanese American University. She was the first woman to enter the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jordan (1962) and also the first woman delegate to represent Jordan at United Nations meetings and the first female diplomat at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nWhile working as a diplomat, she was studying art privately and received some of her early arts training from French teacher, Alice Ladoux. In 1966, following her marriage to Prince 'Ali bin Naif the second son of the ruling Hashemite family on Jordan, she resigned from her diplomatic post and began to take art seriously. She then began to study art formally with Jordanian artists, Muhanna Al-Dura and Armando Bruno. She received a Ph.D. in Islamic art from the University of London in 1993.\n\nWijdan Ali is both a contemporary painter and art historian. Her art explores themes of universal tragedy, especially dramatic events in Arab history, such as the Karbala series, which explores the tragedy that occurred in seventh century Karbala, when the Prophet Mohammed’s grandson, Hussein, was martyred. She also uses the motif of Islamic calligraphy as a graphic form, which was itself a revival of a traditional art form. Her writing explores the rise and fall of an Islamic aesthetic in Islamic art and the dilution of centuries-long traditions, with the arrival of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nShe is founder of the Royal Society of Fine Arts and of the Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts. She is also founder and dean of the newly established Faculty of Arts and Design at the University of Jordan. She is also a patron of the arts and has curated a number of exhibitions of Islamic art.\n\nPrincess Wijdan Bint Fawwaz Muhana took the oath of office as Jordan's new ambassador to Italy before King Abdullah II on October 3, 2006.\n\nIn her art, she develops the traditions of Arabic calligraphy in a modern format and, as such, she forms part of the contemporary school of Arabic calligraphic painting. Due to her use of Arabic calligraphy as a graphic form, she has been described as a pioneer of the \"Hurufiyyah Art Movement\". Her work, which has won awards in Belgium and France, is found in museums and private collections internationally, including the collections of the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, the American National Museum of Women in the Arts and the National Art Gallery, Pakistan. She has participated in the cross cultural cooperation \" the Dance of Visions\" in Gothenburg Sweden, invited by the Swedish artist Ragnhild Lundén. Her best known art works are a series of shimmering desert-scapes made during the 1980s.\n\nShe is a highly respected historian of Islamic art, and has authored, edited and contributed to a number of books, including several devoted to female artists in the Islamic world.\n\nTwo of her seminal works in the field, are:\n\nSelect list of paintings\n\nShe is the daughter of Sharif Fawwaz Muhana, an architect, and Sharifa Nafi'a bint Jamil Ali.

The creator of the \"Gobliiins\" series, Pierre Gilhodes, worked on the game, of which \"Woodruff\" shares its visual style, gameplay and offbeat humor, though is not an official part of the \"Gobliiins\" series or canon.\n\n\"Woodruff\" was distributed in North America in 1995 by Sierra On-Line.\n\nFollowing the near-annihilation of Earth during the last atomic war, the surviving human population retreated to the center of the planet where the last traces of life-sustaining warmth remained. Waiting out the surface radiation, centuries passed before the humans finally ventured back into the world above, discovering that their planet had sprouted a lush, overgrown jungle in their absence along with various races of mutants, including a peaceful race known as the Bouzouk (spelled \"Boozook\" in the US release), who differ from humans by their tails, pointed ears, and extraordinarily long noses. In the societal structure of the Bouzouk there was a King and a Council of Wisemen, seven mystics who had successfully maintained universal harmony by guarding the Chprotznog, a sacred containment unit used to channel and subsequently trap evil spirits.\n\nHaving failed to learn their lesson from last time, the humans immediately waged war on the tranquil Bouzouk tribe in what became known as \"The Great Battle\". In a mere day, the humans destroyed the Bouzouk civilization, massacring many innocent civilians and looting their holy artifacts, including the Chprotznog. The surviving Bouzouks were enslaved and forced to construct a new society for the humans, the great vertical city of Vlurxtrznbnaxl, an economically self-sufficient city run on wind power and surrounded by rich farmland. Its citizens live in different parts of the city according to their socio-economic status: the poor live on the lower levels while the rich and powerful live on the higher levels. The remaining Bouzouk peoples became exploited and oppressed; their once great society in shambles, they're left to work menial jobs and manual labor, living uneasily alongside the humans while their deposed King now spends his days in his dilapidated castle, drinking beer and watching TV.\n\nThe game begins about a century later, where the great city has since devolved into a nightmarish dystopia under the rule of a bureaucratic and totalitarian government. Heading the government is the reclusive President, who's represented by his corrupt advisor, a hideous man known only as the BigWig. In the lower levels of the city, relations between humans and Bouzouks have grown to their most tense, giving rise to a group known as the Bouzouk Freedom Party, a terrorist organization who, being natural pacifists, have yet to commit any actual acts of terrorism.\n\nProfessor Azimuth, an eminent political and scientific human personality known for his work on manipulating the aging process of cells, sympathizes with the plight of the Bouzouks and becomes determined to help end their oppression. In his research, he discovers the legend of the Schnibble, a mystical entity that is believed to have the ability to cause peace and prosperity to flourish in times of need, and begins work on finding a way to unleash it. Word spreads about his goal, and Azimuth is hailed as a hero by the Bouzouk community. Unfortunately, word of the Schnibble also reaches the ears of the BigWig. To stave off any chance of a revolution, the BigWig and his thugs storm the home of Professor Azimuth and his young adopted half-human, half-Bouzouk son, Woodruff.\n\nAzimuth barely has time to hide Woodruff before the BigWig breaks into their home, kidnapping the Professor and ruthlessly gunning down Woodruff's beloved teddy bear in the process, but not before befitting him with a Viblefrotzer, an invention of his own design that helps rapidly speed the aging process. Within seconds, Woodruff ages about fifteen years, finding himself now prepared (albeit without shoes or the ability to read) for an epic quest: rescue his adopted father, avenge the death of his teddy bear by exacting revenge on the BigWig, and unravel the mystery of the Schnibble to help bring harmony back to the city.\n\n\"Woodruff\"'s relatively simple point-and-click interface is nearly identical to the one featured in Sierra's \"\": by moving your cursor over certain objects, they'll become highlighted, indicating that it's an item or person Woodruff can interact with. Woodruff's inventory is accessed by clicking the right mouse button; clicking and dragging an inventory item onto a highlighted object will combine the two. However, if the items do not connect, Woodruff may openly mock you.\n\nDespite a less-than-heralded release in America, \"Woodruff\" was released to primarily positive reviews, with most praise being given to its visual style and sense of humor. Strategy Plus (now \"Computer Games Magazine\") gave it its most notable review, claiming it was \"so addictive, you may lose your job\", which ended up being printed on the box's front cover and used in most of its advertisements. The review further elaborated with \"…features splendid high-resolution graphics that provide further evidence that Sierra is on a roll\". PC Gamer also praised the game for its \"exceptional graphics and sound\", comparing it to other offbeat adventure games such as \"Day of the Tentacle\" and \"Sam & Max Hit the Road\". French magazine \"Joystick\" called it \"truly wonderful\" and \"a real cartoon\". MobyGames currently gives it a ranking of 85 out of 100.\n\nOf the negative aspects of the game, \"Gamer’s Zone\", although having given it a positive review, complained about the often ludicrously hard puzzles, the lack of original music, and the repetitive background sound effects, complaints that were often echoed in other reviews.\n\nDespite critical acclaim, however, \"Woodruff\" failed to find a mass audience and turned out to be a financial disappointment for Sierra, eventually slipping into obscurity behind most of the company's better-known titles. Although \"Woodruff\" has been more or less largely forgotten within the adventure game genre (so little information is there that the game's English voice actors have never been identified; the French version, however, features the voices of Edgar Givry as Woodruff and Claude Piéplu as the narrator), there still remains a small, yet devoted cult fanbase.\n\n\n"}

Although technically born a commoner, the new princess was a scion of the Matsudaira of Aizu, a cadet branch of the Tokugawa shogunate. Her paternal grandfather was Matsudaira Katamori, the last \"daimyō\" of Aizu, whose heir had been created a viscount in the new \"kazoku\" system in 1884. Prince and Princess Chichibu had no children, as Princess Chichibu's only pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.\n\nPrince Chichibu received his commission as a second lieutenant in the infantry in October 1922 and was assigned to the First Imperial Guard Division. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1925 and became a captain in 1930 after graduation from the Army War College. He received a promotion to the rank of major and assigned to command the Thirty First Infantry Division stationed at Hirosaki, Aomori in August 1935.\n\nPrince Chichibu has been implicated by some historians in the abortive 26 February Incident in 1936. How much of a role he actually played in that event remains unclear, but it was clear that he was sympathetic to the rebels and that his political sentiments were in agreement with them, i.e., replacement of the corrupt political party based government with a military dictatorship under direct control of the emperor. His sympathy to the \"Kodoha\" faction within the Imperial Japanese Army was well known at the time. After the assassination of prime minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932, he had many violent arguments with his brother, Emperor Hirohito, about the suspension of the constitution and the implementation of direct imperial rule.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, the prince and his wife were sent on a tour of Western Europe taking several months. They represented Japan at the May 1937 coronation of Britain's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey and subsequently visited Sweden and the Netherlands as the guests of King Gustaf V and Queen Wilhelmina, respectively. This tour ended with the visit of Nuremberg in Germany by the prince alone. There he attended the Nuremberg rally and met Adolf Hitler, with whom he tried to boost relations. At Nuremberg Castle, Hitler launched a scathing attack against Joseph Stalin, after which the prince privately said to his aide-de-camp Masaharu Homma: \"Hitler is an actor, it will be difficult to trust him\". Nevertheless, he remained convinced that the future of Japan was linked to Nazi Germany and in 1938 and 1939, he had many quarrels with the Emperor about the opportunity to join a military alliance with Germany against Great Britain and the United States.\n\nPrince Chichibu Yasuhito was subsequently appointed battalion commander of Thirty-First Infantry Regiment in August 1937, promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1938 and to colonel in August 1939. During the war, he was involved in combat operations, and was sent to Manchukuo before the Nomonhan incident and to Nanjing after the Nanjing Massacre.\nOn 9 February 1939, Chichibu attended a lecture on bacteriological warfare, given by Shirō Ishii, in the War Ministry Grand Conference Hall in Tokyo. He also attended vivisection demonstrations by Ishii.\n\nIn a book about Yamashita's gold, authors Peggy and Sterling Seagrave postulated that Prince Chichibu led from 1937 to 1945 what the authors called the “Golden Lily (\"Kin no yuri\") Operation” by which members of the Imperial Household allegedly were personally involved in stealing treasures from countries invaded by Japan during World War II. These allegations are contrary to a version told in her memoirs by Princess Chichibu (Setsuko), according to which the prince retired from active duty after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in June 1940, spent most of World War II convalescing at his villa in Gotemba, Shizuoka Prefecture, on the eastern foot of Mount Fuji and never really recovering from his illness. He was promoted to major general in March 1945.\n\nAfter World War II, Prince Chichibu was honorary head of many athletic organizations, and was nicknamed the \"sporting Prince\" due to his efforts to promote skiing, rugby and other sports. He was also honorary President of both the Japan–British Society and the Swedish Society of Japan. He was a supporter of Scouting in Japan and attended the Fourth International Conference in 1926.\n\nThe prince was also instrumental in securing the development of rugby union in Japan. He was \"converted\" to rugby after the JRFU president, Shigeru Kayama, returned from a long sea voyage and was able to \"market\" the game to Prince Chichibu.\n\nAfter his death, the Tokyo Rugby Stadium in Kita-Aoyama 2-chome was renamed Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium. A statue of Prince Chichibu in rugby kit was erected there.\n\nPrince Chichibu died from tuberculosis at his Kugenuma villa in Fujisawa, Kanagawa on 4 January 1953. His remains were cremated and the ashes buried at Toshimagaoka Cemetery, Bunkyō, Tokyo, on 12 January 1953.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Brigman was the artist of the syndicated newspaper strip \"Brenda Starr, Reporter\" from 1995 to 2011 and in 2016 became the artist for the newspaper strip \"Mary Worth\".\n\nGrowing up in Atlanta, Brigman's artistic influences included Stan Drake, Gil Kane, and Walt Simonson. She attended Georgia State University and the University of Georgia.\n\nBrigman broke into comics with AC Comics in 1983. A sample \"Astron\" story (eventually published by AC in 1986) earned her a job with DC Comics in 1984, and when this didn't work out she moved on to Marvel Comics. From there, Brigman became part of the \"Power Pack\" team, a book she penciled on and off until issue #17. For the next seven years, Brigman worked exclusively for Marvel, mostly on short runs; she also contributed illustrations to various editions of \"The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\".\n\nBrigman pencilled DC's \"Supergirl\" mini-series in 1994, following that with 1995's Dark Horse Comics' \"Star Wars\" mini-series \"River of Chaos\" (which was written by her former Power Pack collaborator Louise Simonson).\n\nBrigman essentially left the world of comic books in 1995 when she took over as artist for \"Brenda Starr, Reporter\" and stayed on until the strip ended in 2011. In addition to her syndicated strip, she has illustrated (and colored) the \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\" comic strip for \"National Geographic World\" magazine. Brigman also illustrated a series of \"Star Wars\" novels and \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books for Bantam Doubleday Dell.

He was one of six children born to Thomas Patrick Gorman and Mary K Gorman (née MacDonald). He was a parliamentary page boy as a youth, but sports were his love. He was the youngest member of the Canadian lacrosse team that won the gold medal (only two teams competed) at the 1908 Summer Olympics. He then played professionally for a number of seasons. Gorman became a sports writer at the \"Ottawa Citizen\", eventually becoming the sports editor. He worked at the newspaper until 1921.\n\nEven though he had never played hockey, Mr. Gorman was a talented evaluator of talent. Ted Dey, principal owner of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association, had trouble recruiting players for the 1916–17 season and hired Mr. Gorman to do the task. He did it so capably that he was hired as secretary-treasurer.\n\nIn November 1917, Gorman, George Kennedy, Sam Lichtenhein and Mike Quinn all played a part in suspending the NHA and forming the National Hockey League in an effort to rid themselves of Toronto NHA owner Eddie Livingstone. Gorman became the manager and part-owner of the Senators at that time. He helped lead the team to Stanley Cups in 1920, 1921, and 1923. He sold his interest in the Senators in 1925 to Frank Ahearn and became manager-coach of the New York Americans, introducing professional hockey to New York City.\n\nHe resigned from the Americans in 1929 to get involved in horse racing. He managed the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Mexico from 1929 until 1932. In 1932, Gorman brought the horse Phar Lap to Mexico where the horse won the $100,000 Agua Caliente Handicap before dying under mysterious circumstances in San Francisco. When the president of Agua Caliente sold the racetrack in 1932, Gorman was briefly out of sports.\n\nLate in the 1932–33 season, he was hired as coach of the Chicago Black Hawks and became general manager as well the following season, building a defensive squad around Lionel Conacher and goalie Charlie Gardiner. He took the team from last place in their division in 1932–33 to their first Stanley Cup victory in 1934—despite scoring the fewest goals of any NHL team. Ten days after the Cup victory, Gorman resigned after a dispute with the owner. He went to Montreal as their manager-coach and helped the Montreal Maroons to their final Cup in 1935, thus becoming the first (and only) coach to win consecutive Stanley Cups with different teams. Gorman coached the Maroons until the club folded in 1938. In 1940, he became general manager of the Montreal Canadiens and led them to Cup victories in 1944 and 1946. He is the only person to manage four different teams to championships: the Senators, Black Hawks, Maroons and Canadiens. No other General Manager in the history of the NHL, Major League Baseball, the National Football League, or the National Basketball Association has won championships with four different teams.\n\nGorman was also a promoter. One of his flops was after he became manager-coach of the Montreal Maroons when he booked evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson at the Montreal Forum. Few people came. \"No one wanted to be saved,\" he explained. However, some of his better promotions came when he was the Montreal Canadiens general manager. He had Duke Ellington and Frank Sinatra perform at the Forum.\n\nAfter retiring as general manager of the Canadiens in 1946, Gorman bought the Ottawa Senators of the Quebec Senior Hockey League, managing it to win the Allan Cup in 1949. He took figure skater Barbara Ann Scott on a continental tour after she won the figure skating gold medal at the 1948 Winter Olympics. Gorman revived professional wrestling in Montreal and promoted it in Ottawa, and introduced professional baseball to Ottawa in 1951 with the Ottawa Giants of the International League.\n\nIn 1937, he took over management of the Connaught Park Racetrack, a horse race track in Aylmer QC, near Ottawa, of which he had been a part-owner since 1925. Gorman was managing the race track when he died of cancer at a hospital in Ottawa at the age of 74. He was the last living founder of the NHL. He has been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame (1963), the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame (1966), and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (1977).\n\nGorman was married in 1910 to Mary Westwick, sister of Rat Westwick, one of the \"Silver Seven\". They had four children, Mary Kathleen, Dorothy Elizabeth (Betty), Lawrence Franklyn (Frank) and Joseph (Joe). Mary Kathleen, born in 1911, died at two weeks of age. Betty, born in 1919, married Allan Hern, son of goaltender Riley Hern of the Montreal Wanderers. Betty Hern-Gorman and Al Hern had four children, Riley, Diana, Peter and Timothy. Betty died in 2001.\n\nWhile Gorman was with the Montreal Canadiens, Joe was his assistant. After Gorman returned to Ottawa, T.P., Frank and Joe worked together to operate the Ottawa Auditorium and Connaught Park. After Gorman's death from cancer in 1961, Frank and Joe continued to operate the Auditorium until its demolition in 1967 and Connaught until 1984 when Frank died. The track was sold to Joe in 1986 who operated it on his own, until it eventually went bankrupt in 1995. Joe died in 2007.\n\n"}

It has sponsons which extend almost as far forward as the main hull. The airspace between the hulls may be very small or nonexistent. \n\nDepending on the proportions of the sponsons and the depth of the main hull, the cathedral hull can approach the handling characteristics of either the Hickman sea sled, or the vee hull. The naval architect first credited with the successful use of the deep-vee hull form, C. Raymond Hunt, was involved in the design of the original 13’ Boston Whaler. It is cathedral hulled forward, but nearly a flat-bottomed scow at the stern.\n\nThe term \"cathedral hull\" refers to the resemblance of a section through an inverted boat to that of a medieval cathedral.\n\nThe cathedral hull configuration tends to result in a very broad bow; many such boats are completely rectangular. This provides the maximum cargo or working space for a given length and beam. The hull shape is also very stable compared to a conventional v-shaped bottom, and in either light chop conditions or above or so in certain conditions can be faster than a flat bottom, for the same weight, length and beam.\n\nCathedral hulls became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, when the use of fiberglass made economical production of this hull-form possible. The undesirable aspects of the cathedral hull are greater weight and cost, pounding in rough water, and a boxy appearance. Their advantages include high waterplane area at rest (good initial stability) a dry ride in light chop, and reasonable fuel economy at planing speeds. In exposed waters this hullform has been almost totally replaced by the modified-V and deep-V hull forms. After a period of reduced popularity, they live on in modified form as \"deck boats\" which are very popular in the inland lakes and rivers.\n\nThe Cathedral hull design was originated by Naval Architect Richard C. Cole for Thunderbird boats in North Miami, Florida in 1958.\n\n\n\n"}

After the partition, he ruled the Silesian Duchy of Legnica until his death. The second Mongol raid against Poland, led by Nogai Khan, occurred during his reign.\n\nBolesław was the eldest son of the Polish high duke Henry II the Pious by his wife Anna, a daughter of the Přemyslid king Ottokar I of Bohemia. His paternal grandparents were Henry the Bearded and Hedwig of Silesia. Among his younger siblings were Mieszko (died 1242), Henry III the White (d. 1266), Konrad II (d. 1274), Władysław, and Elisabeth, who married her Piast cousin Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland.\n\nBolesław succeeded as Duke of Silesia after his father, Henry II the Pious, was killed in the Battle of Legnica on 9 April 1241, fighting against the Mongol invaders led by Batu Khan. At the time, he and his immediate younger brother Mieszko were the only heirs who had reached majority. Their mother Anna helped them during the transition; some sources even call this period a regency. The Mongol forces conquered most of Silesia, but then withdrew to Hungary.\n\nAfter Henry's death, the Silesian Piasts were not able to maintain their supremacy in the Polish lands. Bolesław's inheritance, including the Southern Greater Polish estates and the Lesser Polish Seniorate Province was threatened by neighboring Piast dukes. By July 1241, his cousin Konrad I of Masovia tried to take over the Polish throne at Kraków. The local nobles, led by the Kraków governor Clement of Ruszczy, strongly resisted but eventually had to yield to Konrad's superior forces. Disappointed by Bolesław's lack of action, they turned their support to Bolesław V the Chaste, who ascended the Kraków throne in 1243.\n\nThere was a similar situation in Greater Poland: after hearing the news of the defeat of Henry II in Legnica, Duke Przemysł I and his brother Bolesław the Pious retook the estates of Kalisz which once had been ruled by their father, the late Duke Władysław Odonic. The local nobility supported them as the true heirs to those lands. Bolesław decided to avoid a fight and renounced all his Greater Poland lands. He tried to retain some districts, such as Santok and Międzyrzecz, but in 1247 the Dukes of Greater Poland ultimately forced Bolesław to resign all his rights to lands in Greater Poland.\n\nWhen in 1242, Bolesław next oldest brother Mieszko died suddenly without leaving an heir, his Lubusz estates reverted to Bolesław and his younger brothers became co-rulers of the Lower Silesian lands. When his brother Henry III the White came of age in 1247, however, he and his younger brothers revolted against Bolesław and even were able to imprison him shortly thereafter.\n\nTo regain freedom, Bolesław signed an agreement with Henry III, dividing the Lower Silesian lands of Legnica and Wrocław. To avoid further fragmentation, the two pledged to offer hospitality to their minor brothers, Bolesław to Konrad II, and Henry to Władysław. Bolesław, as the eldest, got first choice of the districts, and he chose the Legnica estates, possibly because of the gold discovery in the Kaczawa and Wierzbiak Rivers.\n\nBolesław soon regretted his choice and tried to recover Wrocław. Henry III refused to surrender his new duchy, and war was inevitable. Both began preparing for battle, but didn't have adequate funds. Bolesław sought allies among the Ascanian relatives of his wife Hedwig, daughter of Count Henry I of Anhalt. Archbishop Wilbrand of Magdeburg contributed funds after Bolesław sold half of Lubusz Land to him.\n\nThe German aid only gave Bolesław a temporary advantage in the war against his brother. In 1249 his younger brother and co-ruler Konrad II unexpectedly returned to the country (after concluding his studies in Paris). Bolesław proposed him as Bishop of Passau, however, Konrad refused and began to press his own claims in Silesia. Bolesław opposed him, and the young prince took refuge at the court of the Dukes of Greater Poland, Bolesław's long-time enemy. Shortly after, Konrad reinforced his bonds with Duke Przemysł I after a double marriage: the Duke of Greater Poland married Konrad's sister Elizabeth, and Konrad married Duke Przemysł's sister, Salome.\n\nThe final clash occurred two years later, when the Bolesław was defeated by the combined forces of Przemysł I and Henry III the White, who supported Konrad. In 1251 Bolesław finally agreed to the divide his own lands and ceded the Duchy of Głogów to Konrad. Bolesław only retained the small district of Legnica proper.\n\nIt took Bolesław another two years and the help of his brother Henry III to recover full authority over his principality. Bolesław made some agreements with the other Piast dukes, especially with the princes of Greater Poland and with Bishop Thomas I of Wrocław. However, Bolesław never forgave the bishop for his tendency to support the younger princes.\n\nBolesław's conflict with the bishop of Wrocław reached a more critical point in 1257, when the Bolesław incarcerated the bishop at Wleń Castle. Bolesław was immediately excommunicated. His brothers quickly intervened and negotiated a settlement. In 1261, Bolesław's paid a large tribute and paid public penance at the gates of in Wrocław Cathedral. He had been excommunicated twice before, in 1248 and 1249, and a call had been issued to the neighboring nobility to a crusade against him. He was later forgiven by the Bishop, and both of the previous excommunications were rescinded.\n\nBolesław also remained in hostile relations with his brother Duke Konrad of Głogów. In 1257 Konrad kidnapped Bolesław from his castle in Legnica. The duke regained his freedom a few months later. In 1271 Bolesław took the town of Bolesławiec, near Bóbr.\n\nIn the 1270s, Bolesław gave more and more power to his adolescent sons. In 1273 he granted the Duchy of Jawor to his oldest son Henry V and it seemed that Bolesław had resigned from adventurous politics. Nevertheless, in 1277, he signed an alliance with King Rudolph I of Germany, straining the alliance of the other Piast dukes with rivalling King Ottokar II of Bohemia. At Rudolph's insistence, Bolesław kidnapped Ottokar's ally, Duke Henry IV of Wrocław, Bolesław's nephew, and demanded one-third of Wrocław after the death of his uncle Władysław, Bolesław's youngest brother, in 1270. Henry IV was imprisoned in Legnica Castle.\n\nA coalition was formed between Ottokar II, Duke Henry III of Głogów, and Duke Przemysł II of Greater Poland, but it soon failed: while Bolesław's forces were greatly outnumbered at the bloody battle of Stolec, his son Henry V turned the tide and the allied dukes were defeated. A settlement was reached; Henry IV was freed and Bolesław was given one-third of the Duchy of Środa Śląska.\n\nBolesław II died between 26 and 31 December 1278 and was buried at the Dominican monastery of his Legnica residence. His three sons, Henry V the Fat, Bolko I and Bernhard, inherited his lands.\n\nIn 1242, Bolesław married firstly Hedwig (d. 21 December 1259), daughter of Henry I, Count of Anhalt. They had seven children:\n\nIn 1261, Bolesław married secondly Euphemia (also called Alenta or Iolanta or Adelheid) (born c. 1245 - died c. 15 February 1309), daughter of Sambor II, Duke of Pomerania.\n\nAround 1270, he began living with his mistress Sophia of Dyhrn. She bore him a son, Jarosław, who died in infancy. Gravely ill and deeply offended by her husband's affair, Euphemia fled to her homeland in Pomerania in 1275. Their marriage was considered annulled. In 1277 Bolesław finally married his mistress, but the union lasted only a few months until the Duke's death in 1278. Euphemia returned to Silesia after Bolesław's death.\n\n"}

He received an LGSM certificate in 1949, ARCM in 1950, a Bachelor of Music from University of Durham in 1956, and a Doctor of Music in 1965. Between 1957 and 1960 he studied privately with Hans Keller, an association which he has always acknowledged as formative. These lessons were resumed, albeit irregularly, once Walker joined Keller at the BBC in 1961.\n\nFrom 1958-61 Walker lectured at the Guildhall School of Music, having studied piano there with Alfred Nieman, noted for teaching improvisational techniques. He also taught at the University of London from 1954 to 1960. Walker worked at the BBC Radio Music Division as a producer between 1961 and 1971. Seeking to return to his \"first love\", teaching, he gave up radio production and took an appointment as Professor of Music at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, where he chaired the Department of Music from 1971 to 1980, and from 1989 to 1995. In 1981, he was responsible for the establishment at McMaster of the first graduate program in music criticism in Canada. Since 1995, he has been Professor Emeritus at McMaster. From 1984 to 1987, he was a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Music at City University in London.\n\nHis three-volume biography of Franz Liszt, which took him 25 years to complete, has been very influential. Common adjectives attached to the work include \"monumental\" and \"magisterial\", and it is said to have \"unearthed much new material and provided a strong stimulus for further research\". Walker himself says that when he found, as a BBC producer compiling notes for program announcers, that \"there wasn't a decent book in English on Liszt\", he eventually decided to write one himself, but was determined \"not to make a major statement that couldn't be supported by documents ... and because Liszt himself was a traveller the archives were everywhere.\"\n\nThe first volume won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in biography for 1983 and best book on music from the Yorkshire Post Newspapers in 1984. The three-book series was given the Royal Philharmonic Society Book Award in 1998.\n\n\"Time\" magazine praised the biography as \"a textured portrait of Liszt and his times without rival\", saying that Walker's work was \"equally strong on the music and the life\", and discussed Liszt's corpus \"with greater understanding and clarity than any previous biographer\". \"The New York Times\", reviewing the second volume, said of Walker's passion for his subject, \"Mr. Walker can see only the good, and will stand for no criticism of his hero\", but still called Walker's extensive research \"incredible... Mr. Walker seems to know everything about Liszt, and anything connected with Liszt, during every single day of the long life of that genius.\" \"The Washington Post\" music critic Tim Page, including the third volume in his best books of the year list, called it \"unquestionably a landmark\" and \"meticulously detailed, passionately argued and sometimes wrenchingly moving\".\n\nThe technique of biography, and how it differs from other literary genres, has always been of interest to Walker and he has written about it. When asked about the genesis of his Liszt biography he wrote: “I had always been immensely attracted to Liszt’s magnetic personality, and in my childhood I was drawn to the legend of his piano playing as to few other topics. They say that in every biography is an autobiography trying to get out. The idea would be diverting if it were not so sobering. I have come to believe that the best biographies choose their biographers, not vice versa. The lucky biographers write their work not because they have a choice but because they have no choice at all.” \n\nWalker has also written substantially about Robert Schumann and Frédéric Chopin, and continues to lecture in Canada, the US, and UK on all three musicians. In October 2018 he brought to completion a large-scale biography of Fryderyk Chopin, a book on which he worked for ten years. It has been described as “a biographical masterpiece”, and was named Classical Music Book of the Year by the Sunday Times of London. James Penrose in The New Criterion wrote: “With Liszt, and now Fryderyk Chopin so well cared for, one can but hope that Walker will try for the hat trick.”\n\nWalker lives in Ancaster, Ontario. He is director of \"The Great Romantics\", an annual festival in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\n\nWalker has written over 100 articles for scholarly music journals, and provided the biographical entry on Liszt for Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001).

It is one of 214 hills listed in Alfred Wainwright's \"Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells\", which makes it a popular attraction for walkers who are aiming to complete all the \"Wainwrights\". Because of its moderate height and proximity to a main road it is a pleasant half-day excursion that can be done when the higher fells are in cloud.\n\nTroutbeck Tongue branches off south-westward from the main Ill Bell ridge, just north of Froswick. It separates Trout Beck from Hagg Gill, its main upper tributary. These two streams almost reconverge behind the fell, the col connecting to Froswick being at only . This depression carries a number of ancient cairns at the base of the long grassy back-slope of the fell. The character of this side is in marked contrast to the southern tip of the fell, which drops steeply over rocky outcrops to Troutbeck Park.\n\nThe fell is usually climbed from the village of Troutbeck on the A592 road three miles (five kilometres) north of the town of Windermere. From the village it is a pleasant walk to the base of the fell, following the course of the Trout Beck along Ing Lane which leads to Troutbeck Park Farm. This 1,900 acre (7.7 km²) sheep farm was bought by the children's book author and illustrator Beatrix Potter in 1923; it was in danger of development and so she decided to purchase it. When she died in 1943, she left the farm and its land to the National Trust, along with 13 other farms she owned in the Lake District.\n\nThe ascent of the fell begins at the farm. It is quite a steep climb with several rocky outcrops and walls and fences to negotiate, but the modest height of the fell makes it a short ascent of less than 30 minutes. There is some evidence of quarrying near the top of the fell, and this is marked on the Ordnance Survey map.\n\nThe summit is grassy with views restricted by the surrounding higher fells.

Frederic McLaughlin (27 June 1877 – 17 December 1944) was an American businessman and soldier. He was the first owner of the Chicago Black Hawks National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey team.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, McLaughlin inherited the successful \"McLaughlin's Manor House\" coffee business from his father, who died in 1905. McLaughlin was a graduate of Harvard University and served in the United States Army during World War I. McLaughlin achieved the rank of Major and was often referred to as Major McLaughlin for the rest of his life.\n\nIn May 1926, the NHL had granted an expansion franchise to former football star Huntington Hardwick and his syndicate of investors. On 1 June, McLaughlin, who had no experience in the ice hockey business, purchased the Chicago expansion franchise from Hardwick. He named the team the Black Hawks after the nickname of his army unit, the 86th Infantry \"Blackhawk\" Division, where he had served in the 333rd Machine Gun Battalion. Most of the Hawks players were from the Portland Rosebuds of the Western Hockey League purchased from WHL owner Frank Patrick for $100,000. During his 18 years as owner, McLaughlin would lead the franchise to two Stanley Cup wins, in 1934 and 1938.\n\nAt the time McLaughlin acquired the Black Hawks, he was married to Irene Castle, a famous dancer and film actress. She is credited with creating the \"Indian head\" design of the first Black Hawks sweater. McLaughlin was a \"hands on\" owner and he made 13 coaching changes in 18 years. One Hawk coach was Godfrey Matheson, who got the job when he met McLaughlin on the train and impressed McLaughlin with his hockey knowledge. Matheson lost the job after two games.\n\nMcLaughlin was fiercely patriotic, and at various times during his ownership would try to fill his roster with as many Americans as possible, during a time when very few American-born players played in the NHL. The 1938 Stanley Cup win was done with eight Americans on the roster and Bostonian Bill Stewart was coach. Stewart was fired early the next season.\n\nAs an owner, McLaughlin also feuded with other owners. James Norris, the Detroit owner, set up a competing Chicago team in the American Association, locking the Hawks out of the Chicago Stadium. The Norris family would eventually purchase the Hawks after McLaughlin's death. Conn Smythe, manager of Toronto supplies the following quote on McLaughlin:\n\n\"Where hockey was concerned, Major McLaughlin was the strangest bird and, yes, perhaps the biggest nut I met in my entire life.\"\nMcLaughlin died of heart disease at age 67. In 1963, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2030760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030760", "title": "Homebuilt computer", "text": "Homebuilt computer\n\nA custom-built or homebuilt computer is a computer assembled from available components, usually commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, rather than purchased as a complete system from a computer system supplier, also known as pre-built systems.\n\nCustom built or Homebuilt computer is usually considered cheaper to assemble as compared to buying a pre-built computer, since it excludes the labor associated with building a computer, and instead the labor is done by the end-user in assembling their own homebuilt computer.\n\nHomebuilt computers are almost always used at home, like home computers, but home computers were traditionally purchased already assembled by the manufacturer. However, there were kits that were both home computers and homebuilt computers, like the Newbear 77-68, which the owner was expected to assemble and use in his or her home.\n\nComputers have been built at home for a long time, starting with the Victorian era pioneer Charles Babbage in the 1820s. A century later, Konrad Zuse built his own machine when electromechanical relay technology was widely available. In 1965 electronics engineer James Sutherland started building a computer out of surplus parts from his job at Westinghouse. The hobby really took off with the early development of microprocessors, and since then many enthusiasts have constructed their own computers.\n\nEarly examples include the Altair 8800 from the United States and the later British Newbear 77-68 and Nascom designs from the late 70's and early 80's. Some were made from kits of components, or simply distributed as board designs like the Ferguson Big Board. The Altair 8800 pioneered the S-100 bus which somewhat simplified the process. Ultimately, the development of home computers, the IBM PC (and its derivatives and clones), and the industry of specialized component suppliers that grew up around this market in the mid 80's have made building computers much easier. Computer building is no longer limited to specialists. Computers based on Apple Macintosh and Amiga computer platforms often can not be built in general by users legally because of patents and licenses for their hardware, firmware, and software.\n\nAt one time building desktop PCs was a popular hobby. Not only could someone build a desktop that outperformed pre-built models selling in retail stores, but someone building their own computer may add whatever components they want, from multiple hard drives, case mods, high-performance graphics cards, liquid cooling, multi-head high-resolution monitor configurations, or using alternative operating systems without paying the \"Microsoft tax\". As pre-built computers improved in quality and performance, and manufacturers offered more options, it became less cost-effective for most users to build their own computers, and the hobby declined. The growing popularity of laptops and tablets led to a mobile first design methodology that is difficult for home builders to duplicate economically. Recently PC parts have become cheaper, and people are starting to build computers again. With the rise of virtual reality headsets(VR) such as the HTC Vive, the demand for high performance has risen. Competitive games with their own dedicated tournaments have brought about more builders due to more effective customization in performance.\n\nPractically all PCs and some laptops are built from readily interchangeable standard parts. Even in the more specialized laptop market, a considerable degree of standardization exists in the basic design, although it may not be easily accessible to end-users. Although motherboards are specialized to work only with either Intel or AMD processors, all other parts like Graphic Processors, RAM, Chassis/Computer cases have been standardized to fit any setup. The availability of standard PC components has led to the development of small scale custom PC assembly. So-called white box PC manufacturers and commercial \"build to order\" services range in size from small local supply operations to large international operations.\n\nComputer kits include all of the hardware (and sometimes the operating system software, as well) needed to build a complete computer. Because the components are pre-selected by the vendor, the planning and design stages of the computer-building project are eliminated, and the builder's experience will consist solely of assembling the computer and installing the operating system. The kit supplier should also have tested the components to assure that they are compatible.\n\nA barebones computer is a variation on the kit concept. A barebones system typically consists of a computer case with a power supply, motherboard, processor, and processor cooler. A wide variety of other combinations are also possible: some barebones systems come with just the case and the motherboard, while other systems are virtually complete. In either case, the purchaser will need to obtain and install whatever parts are not included in the barebones kit (typically the hard drive, Random Access Memory, peripheral devices, and operating system).\n\nLike mass-produced computers, barebones systems and computer kits are often targeted to particular types of users, and even different age groups. Because many home computer builders are gamers, for example, and because gamers are often young people, barebones computers marketed as \"gaming systems\" often include features such as neon lights and brightly coloured cases, as well as features more directly related to performance such as a fast processor, a generous amount of RAM, and a powerful video card. Other kits and barebones systems may be specifically marketed to users of a free software operating system such as Linux or one of the BSD variants, with components guaranteed for compatibility and performance with that operating system.\n\nMany amateur-built computers are built primarily from used or \"spare\" parts. It's sometimes necessary to build a computer that will run an obsolete operating system or proprietary software for which updates are no longer available, and which will not run properly on a current platform. Economic reasons may also require an individual to build a new computer from used parts, especially among youth or in developing countries where the cost of new equipment places it out of reach of average people.\n\nBuilding one's own computer affords tangible benefits compared to purchasing a mass-produced model, such as:\n\nThere are drawbacks to building one's own PC:\n\nBecause almost all mass-manufactured PCs ship with some version of Microsoft Windows pre-installed, individuals who wish to use operating systems other than Windows (for example, Linux or BSD) often choose to build their own computers. Their reason for doing so is not always related to saving money on an operating system.\n\nBecause Microsoft Windows is the \"de facto\" standard operating system for PCs, hardware device drivers of different qualities can readily be found that will enable virtually any component designed for the PC architecture to function on a Windows platform. However, the same isn't true for alternative operating systems like Linux and BSD, so these system users have to be careful to avoid hardware that is incompatible with their choice of operating system. Even among hardware devices that technically will \"work\" with these alternative operating systems, some will work better than others. Therefore, many users of non-Microsoft operating systems choose to build their own computers from components known to work particularly well with their preferred platforms.\n\nA less common but still relevant option for people who choose to go another route when building their own PC and choosing their operating system may choose to configure what is called a Hackintosh system. This means that the user of the computer builds the computer specifically with the Mac OS in mind. This can often be a very tedious process as Apple has strict standards of what hardware they choose works with their software or not. Following previously built systems that worked is very important for success in this area. This is not generally a recommended route, but this hasn't stopped curious enthusiasts from achieving success.\n\nMost mainstream manufactured computers use common or inexpensive parts such as onboard graphics and audio. While integrated accessories offer dramatic economic savings (and satisfy many users), these options generally do not perform as well as dedicated hardware under high demand situations such as current games, CAD and media production.\n\nHomebuilt computers are most common among gamers, engineers, or other people who demand more performance from a specific component than the average user. An example would be a gamer using a slightly behind-the-curve CPU and disk drive, spending the difference on a more capable dedicated graphics card.\n\nAdditionally, those with more specific computer needs usually appreciate being able to upgrade certain components to fit their needs and the evolving needs of the software being used; in a typical manufactured PC the support components (such as power supply unit, motherboard, or even the chassis) are unfit for accepting high-performance add-in components. Constructing a system with future expansion in mind allows for such upgrades, which in turn are much cheaper than buying a brand new computer every time individual components become obsolete or insufficient to meet the needs of the user.\n\nHigh-end PCs most often fall in the realm of heavy processor and/or memory usage applications such as a multimedia PC, home theater PC, music production, engineering, and many more. Generally a high-end system is capable of meeting the demands of gaming and can be used as such. A major difference between a high-end PC and a gaming PC is likely to only be the choice in video card since they will share a majority of other components. While a general-purpose high-end computer may be put to use in a render farm or as a file server, and be provisioned with components targeted at this use (such as a fast GPU for rendering or high-performance storage for serving files), most gaming takes place in real time so with a gaming PC all the components matter in creating a flawless and seamless experience. A less-intensive type of build satisfies or exceeds the needs of most computer users.\n\n"}

The pass lies a few kilometres east of Piz Bernina, and south of Val Minor.\n\nThe Bernina Pass is crossed by road and rail, with a popular tourist train, the \"Bernina Express\" operating year-round between Chur and Tirano. The train crosses the pass west of the road at a slightly lower (at Ospizio Bernina) - it is the highest adhesion railway route in Europe.\n\nLago Bianco, Lej Nair and Lej Pitschen are located on the pass.\n\nThe pass was an important trade route over the Alps during the Middle Ages. In 1410 several communities north and south of the pass agreed to work together to maintain it. In 1512 the Three Leagues and their Swiss allies invaded the Valtellina region through the Bernina Pass. At this time the first road over the pass was mentioned. It covered a distance of about from Poschiavo to Pontresina.\n\nThe building of the road began in 1842. Head of engineers was Rudolf Albertini (1821–1896) from Zuoz.

Nanjangud lies on the banks of the river Kapila (Kabini), 23 km from the city of Mysore. Nanjangud is famous for Srikanteshwara Temple. Nanjangud is also called \"Dakshina Kashi\" (southern Kashi). This city is also famous for a variety of banana grown in the region, the Nanjanagoodu rasabale.\n\nThe Srikanteshwara Temple at Nanjangud is dedicated to the Hindu supreme deity Shiva, also called Sri Nanjundeshwara, (\"The Lord who drank poison\") to save the earth. In Hindu mythology, the Gods and demons churned the ocean in search of the ambrosia. During this churning, poison emanated first, followed by ambrosia. To prevent the poison from spreading across the universe, Shiva drank it. His consort Parvati then held his throat tightly to prevent the poison from spreading to the rest of his body. The poison remained in his throat, making it blue in colour. For this reason, Shiva is also called Neelakantha, or \"the blue-throated one\". Nanjanagud literally means \"the place where Nanja (Nanjundeshwara) resides\" in Kannada - Nanja is a short form of Nanjunda (Najannu unDava - one who drank poison), or \"home of Nanja (Nanjundeshwara)\". Srikanteshwara translates to Sri meaning auspicious, Kanta meaning throat and Eshwara meaning Shiva.\n\nNanjangud has been a major Shaiva centre for nearly a thousand years. Chola Kings in the 11th – 12th century are considered to have set in motion the construction of the temple with significant additions by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings. This temple was later renovated by the Hoysala kings. The Wodeyar kings of Mysore made various grants to renovate the temple.\n\nNanjangud is located at . It has an average elevation of 657 metres (2155 ft). The taluk borders Mysore taluk of Mysore district to the north, T Narsipur taluk of Mysore district to the east, H D Kote taluk of Mysore district to the west and Gundlupet and Chamarajanagar taluks of Chamarajanagar district to the south.\n\nNanjangud Town is the headquarters of Nanjangud Taluk which contains 5 hoblis and around 180 villages.\n\nWikiMapia.org Link:\n\nBuses are available from Bengaluru, Mysore and Chamarajanagar. The nearest airport is Mysuru Airport situated at Mandakalli at a distance of 18 km from Nanjangud and 6 km from Mysuru.\n\nNanjangud has a railway station where only slow trains stop. Trains are available from Mysore at 4.50 am, 7.10 am, 8.50 am, 12.20 pm, 2.40 pm and 1.40 pm.\nReturns trains to Mysore are available at 7.38 am, 10.00 am, 11.28 am, 3.38 pm, 5.38 pm, 6.43 pm and 9.33 pm.\n\nThe town is famous because of the huge temple dedicated to Lord Nanjundeswara also referred to as Srikanteswara. It is believed that sage Gauthama stayed here for some time and installed a Lingam, the idol form of Shiva. Nanjangud is also known as Dakshina Kashi or Varanasi of the South.\n\nThe temple was originally built by the Ganga rulers in the 9th century during their occupation of this region. The residing deity of the temple was later called \"Hakim Nanjunda\"; as given by the Tippu Sultan as it is said a favorite elephant of his was cured after prayer was offered to the deity. The same story is attributed to Hyder too (as per Mysore Gazetteer)! It is said and inscribed in the temple history that his favourite and beloved elephant was bestowed with eyesight by the Lord, after Tippu Sultan's vow with the local deity. The Sultan then had a Lingam made of jade along with an emerald necklace and donated it to the temple. The \"Vaidya Nanjundeswara\", even today is said to be a healer for his believers, and one can see even today worshippers doing \"Urulu seve\", a ritualistic practice after taking bath in the Kapila river. You will find a very old Bilva tree, near the main deity block, its custom to view the tree for full blessings, no one has the idea as to how old this tree is. The main bilva leaves is considered very auspicious and very sacred for Shiva Puja.\n\nVeda Brahma. T. S. Vishweshwara Dikshith is the composer of world-famous Sree Srikanteshwara Suprabhata Stotram of Lord. Srikanteshwara of Nanjangud. Sri. T. S. Vishweshwara Dikshith was a learned Sanskrit scholar in several Vedas (Yajur Veda in particular) and specialised in Ghana Krama - which is the essence of the Vedas. He also composed the Sree Sharada Suprabhata and Sree Chandramoulishwara Suprabhata of Sri Sharada temple, Sringeri and Sri Chandramoulishwara temple in V. V. Mohalla, Mysore respectively. He was a Ghana Pati and had mastered several Shastras such as Alankara Shastra, Jyothishya Shastra (Astrology), Tarka, and Vyakarana (Literature) to name a few. He received several awards and accolades from the Maharaja of Mysore, their holiness the pointiffs' of Sringeri Sharada Peetham and Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam respectively for contributions made to Sanskrit Literature. He was also a founding member of \"Sri Surasaraswathi Sabha\" under the able guidance of Jagadguru Sri Srimad Abhinava Vidyateertha Mahaswamigal, who was the 35th Acharya of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham\n\nTwice every year thousands of worshippers gather for the famous Chariot Festival locally known as the Dodda Jathre and the Chikka Jathre. Idols of Lord Srikanteshwara, Goddess Parvathi, Lord Ganapathi, Lord Subramanya and Lord Chandikeshwara are kept in five separate chariots and a traditional puja is performed to the idols early in the morning on the Jathre day. After the puja, chariots are flagged off. Thousands of devotees pull the Chariots carved out of wood, across the streets of the old town. The town remains immersed in festivities on the Jathre days.\n\nNear Nanjangud is the sangam, where the Kapila and Kaundinya rivers meet. This place is termed as Parashurama Kshetra which is where the sage Parashurama is said to have cleansed himself from the sin of beheading his mother.\n\nIt is said that Parashurama got immense peace of mind at this place which he did not get anywhere else. So he decided to make a penance at the place where Nanjundeshwara temple presently exists. At that time, only Adi Keshava Temple existed (which is now by the side of main-shrine). While cleaning up the place with his axe, he accidentally hit the head of Lord Shiva, who was performing penance underground. Blood started flowing and Parushurama was frightened to have committed another sin. Then Lord Shiva consoled him not to worry and build a temple of his, adjacent to Adi Keshava's. Lord Shiva also told Parashurama to perform penance at Nanjangud. Parashurama performed at the place where his temple presently is located. Lord Shiva was then immensely happy with it and gave blessings that those who visit Nanjangud should definitely visit Parashurama temple to complete their pilgrimage effectively and fruitfully.\n\nThe bridge is across Kabini river, which has been declared as the oldest bridge with both railway line and road on the same bridge by the Government of India. It is located at the entrance of temple town here. \n\nThe Kabini Bridge was built by DalvoyDevraj in 1735 with brick, sand and stone in Gothic style. Though it was built before the railway tracks were laid, the bridge was and is more commonly labelled as a Railway bridge. The Kabini Bridge has a series of Gothic arches of 10ft span with 8ft wide intervening piers. The earth cushion over the arch crest is over 5 feet. The foundations are laid on rocky strata and built in lime concrete. The bridge is of stone masonry with lime concrete filling and mortar. It has 51spans of 10 feet and before 1902 it existed as a road bridge ferrying bullock, camel and horse carriage traffic across the Kabini. A narrow gauge Railway line was being built from Mysore to Nanjangud in 1902 and the Railways used the arched bridge to connect it to the Nanjangud railway station. Trains ran on this bridge from 1902 to 2007. The last train to run on this heritage rail infrastructure was on January 17, 2007 when the Railways decided to put a stop to meter gauge trains and operate broad gauge trains.

The cookies, which originated in Ancient Roman cuisine, are found in several traditional European cuisines. Angel wings are known by many other names and have been incorporated into other regional cuisines (such as American cuisine) by immigrant populations. They are most commonly eaten in the period just before Lent, often during Carnival and on Fat Thursday, the last Thursday before Lent – not to be confused with \"Fat Tuesday\" (Mardi Gras), the day before the start of Lent (Ash Wednesday). There is a tradition in some countries for husbands to give angel wings to their wives on Friday the 13th in order to avoid bad luck.\n\nIngredients used in the preparation of angel wings typically includes flour, water, egg yolk, confectioners' sugar, rectified spirit or rum, vanilla and salt.\n\nIn the various national cuisines, angel wings are referred to as:\n\nIn Bulgaria, angel wings are called \"kukurini\", and are only found in Bansko, south-east Bulgaria. They are typically sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nIn France, the fried pastry are made in central-eastern France, including Lyon and Saint-Étienne, and are closely related to beignets. Traditionally, Lyon cold meat shops sold \"bugnes\" just before Lent, due to their high fat content. They are also made in the home as a way of using surplus cooking fat, which would be wasted during Lent. More recently, bakeries make them, respecting more or less the tradition of Lent.\n\nFrench \"bugnes\" varieties include crunchy \"bugnes\" and soft \"bugnes\". The crunchy variety, known as \"bugnes lyonnaises\" (\"Lyon \"bugnes\"\"), are cooked in very hot oil with the dough spread out thinly and knotted once or twice. The soft variety, sometimes known as \"pillows\", are made with a thicker dough, which is rarely knotted.\n\nHungarian csöröge are made from egg yolk, flour, a leavening agent, sugar, salt and cognac or brandy. They are deep fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They are traditional at weddings.\n\nItalian \"chiacchiere\" are eaten at Carnival time. Their various regional names include: \"frappe\" (a name shared with similar treats) in Rome and Lazio; \"sfrappole\" in Emilia Romagna; \"bugie\" in Genoa and Piedmont; and \"galani\" or \"crostoli\" in Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, especially in Trieste. \"Fritte\" and many other regional names exist. Regional variations in the recipe include sprinkling with orange zest or using anisette wine as the alcoholic base. It is very common in Italian families to make them at home. They often accompany the similarly-famous \"\"\n\n“Žagarėliai” and “Skruzdėlynas” are the equivalents of Angel Wings in Lithuania. \n\nŽagarėliai (or “small sticks” in English) are delicate pastry dough cookies, deep fried in fat. It is best to use lard or oil for deep frying these cookies.\n\nSkruzdėlynas translates as “anthill” in English and is layers of fried dough strips, covered in honey and topped with poppy seeds. It is a typical dessert served during Lithuanian family celebrations.\n\n\"Faworki\" and \"chrusty\" are the plural forms of the words \"faworek\" and \"chrust\" respectively.\n\nThe Polish word \"faworki\" was the name reserved for colourful ribbons attached to either female or male clothing, especially ribbons given to medieval knights by their ladies. Etymologically the word \"faworki\" came to Poland from the French word \"faveur\", meaning 'grace' or 'favour'.\n\nThe Polish word \"chrust\" means 'dry branches broken off trees' or 'brushwood'. \"Chruścik\" is a diminutive of \"chrust\".\n\n\"Verhuny\" are sweet cookies, fried in lard, which have the form of oblong strips. \"Verhuny\" are a Ukrainian confectionery with non-yeast dough, which includes flour, butter, eggs, sugar and additives such as alcohol (rum, brandy or horilka) or, in extreme cases, vinegar (vinegar sometimes together with alcohol). As substitute for butter, but more often as an additional component in \"verhuny\", milk products (milk, smetana i.e. sour cream, or cream) are added. Traditionally, Ukrainian \"verhuny\" should only be fried in lard.\n\nIn the United States, many ethnic bakeries in the cities of Cleveland, Chicago, Buffalo, and Detroit make angel wings, and they are especially popular during the holidays of Easter and Christmas. During those holidays, some bakeries require people to pre-order their angel wings.\n\n"}

The population of the village as at the 2011 census was 444. The population in mid-2014 was 470 people, with 70 people aged 0–15, 270 people aged 16–64 and 135 people aged 65+. The higher levels of government are Tewkesbury Borough Council and Gloucestershire County Council.\n\nThe village has a long history, at one stage being held by the rebellious baron Simon de Montfort. Its economy used to be heavily involved with salmon-fishing in the Severn, as illustrated by a carving in the local church of three salmon caught in a fishing net. Fishing for elvers remains an important activity. The local church, St Peter's, lies right next to the river, with three ancient yews in the churchyard.

It is headed by a State Herald (known unofficially as the National Herald since 2004) and its functions are to register arms, badges, flags and seals (as well as names and uniforms), to keep a public register, to issue registration certificates and, since 1980, to advise the government on heraldic matters. Together with the Heraldry Council, it forms part of the National Archives and Records Service (formerly called the State Archives Service), which is currently under the authority of the Minister of Arts & Culture.\n\nUnder South African law, everyone has the right to bear a coat of arms as he pleases, as long as he does not infringe on the rights of others (i.e. the arms are not too similar to arms already in use by someone else) and the proposed arms conform to basic heraldic principles. The State Herald approves of and registers arms under the authority given by the Heraldry Act. \n\nIn addition to registering coats of arms, badges, and other heraldic representations, the Bureau keeps records of names, uniforms, and badges (which include some corporate arms) previously registered by the Department of the Interior (1935–1959) and the Department of Education, Arts & Sciences (1959–1963). Anyone, regardless of nationality or place of residence, may register arms with the Bureau. Since 1980, it has also been authorised to register the arms of official bodies in foreign countries.\n\nOriginally, applications had to be approved by the Heraldry Council before the Bureau could register them, but the power of approval was delegated to the State Herald in 1969, though he can still refer applications to the Council (or, since 1980, its Heraldry Committee) when necessary. In 1980, the National Herald was authorised to delete arms from the register, either on an applicant's request or, in the case of official, municipal or corporate arms, if the organisation concerned no longer exists. Appeals against the National Herald's decisions can be made to the Heraldry Committee.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Bureau registered between 60 and 90 arms and badges per year. The number increased sharply in the mid-1980s, reaching a peak of 148 in the 1987–88 reporting year. It declined in the early 1990s, and returned to 1970s levels. (These figures do not include the registrations of defence force unit arms and insignia, of which the Bureau has registered more than 1000 since the 1960s.)\n\nThe illustrated blazons (written descriptions in technical terms) of applications for registration are published in the South African \"Government Gazette\". Blazons (but not illustrations) of arms registered at the Bureau and its predecessors up to the end of the year 2000 are available online through the National Archives website.\n\nNaturally, the Bureau itself has a coat of arms. which were adopted in 1965. The blazon is \"Azure, three escutcheons Or, on a chief of the second the South African lion\". In layman's language this means that the shield is blue, it displays three smaller golden shields, and across the top is a gold horizontal strip displaying the red lion that formed the crest of the old South African national coat of arms. The Bureau arms are depicted on the seal on each registration certificate and, in the 1960s and early 1970s, they were depicted in full colour at the head of the certificate too.\n\nThe State Herald (called unofficially the National Herald since 2004) is a civil servant, and is the head of the Bureau of Heraldry, an \"ex officio\" member of the Heraldry Council, and a member of the National Archives' directorate. There have been four state/national heralds since the office was established in 1963:\n\n\nThe Bureau has a small staff complement: the National Herald, the Assistant National Herald, a Chief Heraldic Artist, a few artists, an administrative assistant, and a cleaner.\n\nThe Bureau has had four homes since its inception. Since 1989 it has been housed in the National Archives building in Pretoria.\n\nAlthough the State Herald has been called the National Herald since 2004, the Heraldry Act has not yet been amended to reflect this change.\n\n\n\n"}

He makes persistent sexual advances that are unwelcome, so Buffy slams his head against the steering wheel. Giles informs Buffy that the remains of another member of the team, Dodd, were found on the beach after a party. The Scooby Gang try to determine what killed him. Xander bumps into Cameron who rubs his elite status, as a member of the swim team, in Xander's face and goes to the cafeteria for a snack. Xander hears him scream and on investigating, finds a ransacked cafeteria, Cameron's skin and a humanoid sea creature.\n\nIn the library, Cordelia tries to sketch the creature that Xander saw. Buffy and Willow return, having been informed that Cameron and Dodd were the two best swimmers on the boys' team; after them was Gage. Having little else to go on, Buffy shadows Gage as the potential next target. At the Bronze that night, Gage confronts Buffy about her following him; she tells him that he may be in danger. He does not believe her and leaves, only to be attacked by Angelus in the parking lot. Buffy fights off the vampire, noting as she does that Angelus was spitting out Gage's blood rather than drinking it.\n\nThe following day, Buffy, Willow and Cordelia sit in on swim practice, discussing Angelus' behavior. They speculate that the swim team may be taking steroids which act as a repellent to vampires, but an attractant to the sea creatures. Xander joins the swim team in an effort to get information from places the girls would not have access to.\n\nBuffy hears Gage cry out in pain; she finds him transforming into one of the creatures and others in the locker room with him. Buffy and Giles tell Coach Marin that members of his team are not being killed by the creatures, but are transforming into them. Meanwhile, Xander tries to find out what drug his team members are taking and how to get it. He finds out that what the boys are assuming are steroids is being pumped in with the sauna steam and that Xander is inhaling it as they speak.\n\nIt is revealed that Nurse Greenleigh is a co-conspirator with Marin; they have been conducting experiments on the swim team with fish DNA, in order to get a winning team.

{"id": "2030860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030860", "title": "Meta-discussion", "text": "Meta-discussion\n\nThe term meta-discussion means a discussion whose subject is a discussion. Meta-discussion explores such issues as the style of a discussion, its participants, the setting in which the discussion occurs, and the relationship of the discussion to other discussions on the same or different topics. It is one of many terms based on the inferred meaning of the \"meta-\" prefix. The etymology for the prefix dates back to use of \"Metaphysics\" as the title of the treatise by Aristotle that came after his works on physics in the traditional ordering of his books. The fundamental meaning of the prefix in Greek is simply \"after.\" The modern, inferred meaning of a higher-order, self-referential consideration of the nature of an activity—rather than actual, first-level participation in the activity—has led to many neologisms such as meta-wiki.\n\nOne of the most easily understood examples of meta-discussion occurs in the criticism of a literary work, such as a novel. On-topic discussion of a novel, rather than meta-discussion, would include such things as the consideration of a particular character, examination of incidents in the plot, or exploration of the general themes of the book. For instance, writing or talking about the unnamed governess in Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\" would constitute on-topic, first-level discussion.\n\nAs it happens, published commentary about the governess has reached enormous proportions. So significant meta-discussion about such first-order criticism has arisen. Literary critic Edmund Wilson, for instance, offered various theories about the governess and other aspects of \"The Turn of the Screw\" over the years, as other critics influenced him to recant or modify his views. As a result, substantial discussion of Wilson's commentary on the book has occurred. This constitutes a classic example of meta-discussion based on Wilson's original, first-order examination of James' book.\n\nOther examples of meta-discussion often occur on Usenet or other Internet-based discussion forums. Frequently, contributors to these forums will complain about the tone of the discussion, the personalities of other contributors as supposedly revealed in the conversation, the inability to stick to the topic at hand, or comparisons of the discussion to conversations elsewhere on the Internet. All these constitute meta-discussion based on first-order Internet conversations about a particular topic.\n\nMeta-discussion does not mean a simple change of subject. If all those conversing about a particular subject suddenly start exploring another subject, no meta-discussion has taken place. In fact, such a shift or attempted shift in subject matter will often provoke meta-discussion about contributors not sticking to the topic or trying to avoid issues in the original discussion.\n\nIn fact, it may be a relatively rare occurrence that any substantial, extended discussion of a subject does not include at least some meta-discussion. Simple requests for a contributor to pay attention or to let others be heard are very common examples of meta-discussion in both face-to-face conversation and written communication.\n\nMeta-discussion may seem artificial and even a waste of time. Especially in debates and other adversarial discussions, some participants may believe that their opponents are trying to evade consideration of the issues at hand by recourse to meta-discussion. This often leads to comments like \"stick to the subject\" or \"answer the question,\" which are themselves meta-discussion, though of a simple variety.\n\nStill, it may sometimes be valuable to explore the higher-order issues about a discussion rather than the subject of the discussion itself. Tactful consideration of personality issues with some contributors as revealed in a discussion may lead to better insight and calmer exploration of the primary topic of the conversation.\n\n"}

He is best known for writing \"The Life of John Maynard Keynes\" (1951) and for the development of the Harrod–Domar model, which he and Evsey Domar developed independently. He is also known for his \"International Economics\", a former standard textbook, the first edition of which contained some observations and ruminations (wanting in subsequent editions) that would foreshadow theories developed independently by later scholars (such as the Balassa–Samuelson effect).\n\nBorn in London he attended St Paul's and then Westminster School. Harrod attended New College in Oxford on a history scholarship. After a brief period in the Artillery in 1918 he gained a first in \"literae humaniores\" in 1921, and a first in modern history the following year.\nAfterwards he spent some time in 1922 at King's College, Cambridge. It was there that he met and befriended Keynes.\n\nAfter moving back to Oxford, he became a Student (i.e., Fellow) and Tutor in economics at Christ Church. He held the fellowship in modern history and economics until 1967. He remained in contact with Keynes until Keynes's death in 1946, and was later his biographer (1951). Harrod was additionally a Fellow at Nuffield College 1938 to 1947 and from 1954 to 1958.\n\nAt Oxford Harrod was part of the Railway Club, which included: Henry Yorke, Roy Harrod, Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath, David Plunket Greene, Edward Henry Charles James Fox-Strangways, 7th Earl of Ilchester, Brian Howard, Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse, John Sutro, Hugh Lygon, Harold Acton, Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, Mark Ogilvie-Grant, John Drury-Lowe.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he was briefly in Winston Churchill's \"S-branch\" – a statistical section within the Admiralty.\n\nAt the 1945 General Election he stood as Liberal candidate for Huddersfield and finished third.\n\nIn 1966, Harrod, was the 2nd winner of the prestigious Bernhard-Harms-Preis. After retiring in 1967, he moved to Holt, Norfolk.\n\nInterviewed for the book \"Authors take Sides on Vietnam\", Harrod declared himself a supporter of the American military campaign in Indochina.\n\nAssar Lindbeck, the former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee, wrote that Harrod would have been awarded a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences if he had lived longer.\n\nHarrod married Wilhelmine \"Billa\" Cresswell (1911–2005), step-daughter of General Sir Peter Strickland, in 1938. One of their sons was Dominick Harrod, an economics correspondent for the BBC.\n\nAfter the death of his Cambridge friend and colleague, the economist John Maynard Keynes, in 1946, Harrod and Austin Robinson wrote a lengthy obituary of Keynes for \"The Economic Journal\". At the encouragement of Geoffrey Keynes, Harrod then undertook the task of writing a major biography of Keynes. \"The Life of John Maynard Keynes\" was published to widespread acclaim in 1951, at a time when most of Keynes's family and friends were still alive.\n\nWith the post-war influence of so-called Keynesian economics and then challenges to it, cultural interest in the Bloomsbury Group, and the publication of thirty volumes of \"The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes\" in the 1970s and 1980s, high interest in Keynes's life led to further biographies, most prominently by Robert Skidelsky and Donald Moggridge, and to detailed studies such as by Donald Markwell on Keynes and international relations. These works have corrected and added details to the Keynes depicted by Harrod, and Skidelsky in particular has contrasted his account of Keynes with what he has depicted as Harrod's hagiography.\n\nAlthough Harrod is also typically remembered for his contributions to growth theory with his Harrod-Domar growth model some argue that he was the first Post-Keynesian economist to provide a detailed institutional exposition of the theory of endogenous money. In his book, \"Money\" he provides a detailed institutional discussion of how the contemporary monetary system operates. He highlights, among other things: that loans create deposits; that central banks attempt to control the level of economic activity through the influence they exert on interest rates; and that central banks automatically extend funds when government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates. This last point discredits the mainstream views on crowding out and makes Harrod an early progenitor of the Modern Monetary Theory school of economics.\n\n\n\n"}

His mastery, expertise, originality and innovative approach to close-up artistry, magic earned him a legendary reputation in the magic world. He traveled the world performing for the public as well as performing and lecturing fellow magicians. As a result, he served as an inspiration to generations of well-known magicians, celebrities and entertainers, including Doug Henning, Dick Cavett, Bill Bixby, Ricky Jay, David Copperfield and countless others. Although he was best known as a master of close-up artistry, he continually demonstrated an extraordinary performing ability and during his lifetime was responsible for a long series of books, films and publications highlighting his mastery of the magical crafts. For his work, he received the highest honors that his profession could bestow, including both the coveted \"Masters Fellowship Award\" and \"Performing Fellowship Award\" from the Academy of Magical Arts. During his lifetime, Tony Slydini was inducted into the Society of American Magicians Hall of Fame as a \"Living Legend\".\n\nTony Slydini was born as Quintino Marucci in Foggia, Italy. He was the son of an amateur magician, who encouraged him to pursue sleight of hand at an early age. While still young, Slydini and his uncle left Italy to live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was there that he began to experiment more seriously with magic. He had no access to books on magic, nor personal instruction or magical performing apparatus of any kind. Yet, without any help or guidance, he focused on his craft and reinvented much of the popular magic of the time, along with developing many new effects and illusions.\n\nEarly on, Slydini was attracted to the psychological aspects of his art, which would continually show itself in his magic in the form of precise and expert use of timing and misdirection. He was inspired by the relationship between a magician and his audience, which fueled his desire to be a close-up artist who would work intimately with the spectators. He became so good at it that he continually fooled the magicians for whom he performed, so much so that the famous dean of magicians, Dai Vernon, once remarked, \"Slydini is the only magician who could ever fool me.\"\n\nAs a young man, Slydini had worked in South America's version of vaudeville for a time. But soon, the Great Depression struck that continent and work became scarce. In 1930, he moved to New York City, finding a job in at Hubert's Dime museum on 42nd Street. The Dime museum was designed as a center for entertainment for the working class, and in New York City, where many immigrants settled, they provided popular and inexpensive entertainment. Hubert's provided the young magician with a grand platform, on which he could experiment and continue to enhance and develop his already sharpened skills. From there, Slydini found work in carnivals and sideshows throughout the country. He was entertaining everyday workers and their families, but gaining valuable experience, knowledge and psychological expertise, while traveling and meeting people from coast to coast.\n\nIn 1935, while Slydini was playing a museum in Paterson, N. J., the manager billed him as \"Tony Foolem\", in the absence of any better suggestion by Quintino Marucci, (Slydini's birth name). The other acts on the bill became friendly with the magician and told him that they thought the name Tony Foolem was a poor choice and between them, they worked out the \"Tony Slydini\" stage name—the \"sly\" for being slick, and the \"Dini\" to follow the vogue for having something akin to the well known name of the successful Houdini. Tony was a shortened name for his given name Quintino and so, thus was \"Tony Slydini\" born.\n\nOn a visit to his sister in Boston during the 1930s, Slydini attracted the attention of an agent, landing a job for $15 a day for a three-day-a-week show. The agent recognized his skills and flawless sleight of hand which he performed with playing cards, coins and two ordinary white silks. Slydini was an expert in timing and misdirection and it showed. Unlike the performing magicians of the time, it was audience reactions that guided his performances. He remained in Boston for nearly seven years before moving back to New York. It was there, in 1947, that Slydini opened his magic studio located at 341 West 45th Street. Magicians from around the world came to that location for more than fifty years seeking instruction and guidance.\n\nSlydini continued to gain popularity through his public performances including many private club and party dates and would travel the United States from New York to California, playing scattered engagements in museums, carnivals, side shows, etc., while remaining practically unknown to the world of magicians. It was finally through magician Herman Hanson, a close associate of Howard Thurston, that Slydini was brought before the local magic fans, eventually going on their public shows, etc., in New York, Boston and Hartford. From there, he was quickly grabbed to appear on the well known Barbizon Plaza show in New York City where he made an instant hit with his different style of magic. His fame spread and soon other well-known magicians from around the world sought out his company and expertise including the legendary Cardini, Dai Vernon, Okito, The Great Virgil, Bert Allerton, Al Flosso and Jack Gwynne. Eventually, he appeared in Atlantic City before a national conclave of magicians and from there, his reputation as a \"Magician’s Magician\" was cemented.\n\nThroughout the war, Slydini entertained thousands of soldiers in camps, hospitals and recreation centers. Between 1949 and 1950, he toured the United States under the direction of Ralph W. Read, who booked him to give his famous \"Lecture Demonstrations\" before over 30 magical organizations. Private lessons were also given on this tour, and many club dates as well, in the large cities on the route. Along the way, the performances and demonstrations at magic gatherings captured even more attention from his fellow magicians. Eventually, Europe and Asia requested his presence and he complied. While there he performed publicly, made televised appearances and gave numerous lectures and private instruction to inquiring magicians wanting to learn his new form of close-up magic and misdirection. In 1958, he headlined the International Brotherhood of Magicians British Ring's magic convention. Frank Joglar, reporting for Jean Hugard’s Magic Monthly, wrote, \"There is no doubt who was the star of the Convention. It was Slydini, whose close-up work, lecture and Gala Show act were in every detail flawless. Reports from up, down and around the British Isles praised the lecture Tony gave on the tour.\"\nThereafter, Tony Slydini would focus almost exclusively on teaching and lecturing, illustrating to others his original performing techniques and unique methods of misdirection.\n\nSlydini was largely unknown to the public but became a legend to those in the magic profession. He was constantly featured in the magic magazines and publications. The Linking Ring, a publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, highlighted him in their 1951 February issue. Talk show host Dick Cavett wrote about his first meeting with Slydini in a \"New York Times\" column, \"Doug Henning said to me, ‘Tony’s doing a special demonstration for some magicians tomorrow night at Vesuvio restaurant. Come.’ Tomorrow night finally came. For the magicians, sitting for nearly two hours at that table, sudden gasps and intakes of breath abounded. It was like seeing a man walk up a wall. Nothing prepared you for it. Right at the start, a solid, heavy silver dollar, held before my eyes, vanished into thinnest air. And by no method I knew of. Certainly no sleeves. The two hours flew too quickly.\"\n\nCavett and Slydini became friends and soon afterwards the talk show host featured the magician in a televised special, which was so well received that a second broadcast followed.\n\nSlydini would go on to appear on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and other popular broadcast venues of his time, but this was not his forte. It had become teaching, training and an increased research and development of the art of misdirection. He was willing to teach and the magicians he served were willing to learn.\n\nSlydini's influence spread across the magic spectrum such that by 1975, his fame led to a major event in the field of magic. Joe Stevens, of \"Stevens Magic Emporium\", organized a gathering of magicians in Las Vegas in March 1978. The event, attended mostly by professional magicians was a first and it was called \"The Slydini Seminar\". The annual event grew in popularity and size, becoming known as the \"Desert Magic Seminar\" and later the \"World Magic Summit\". Tony Slydini presented three solid hours of shows and lectures, plus additional semi-private lessons available to the 90 magicians in attendance and began a tradition of educational offering to magicians, expanding the number and nature of lectures with an emphasis on variety and versatility. Slydini attended and lectured at the event originally named for him until his health no longer permitted travel.\n\nOver his lifetime, many books on were written about Slydini, his sleight-of-hand techniques, the psychology behind his performance and his clever methods of misdirection.In 1976, Slydini wrote a personal authorization letter to all magic societies and associations in North America, sponsoring his protégé, Bill Wisch, to represent him and take his place introducing, demonstrating and marketing his long awaited, two-volume, book sets, \"THE BEST OF SLYDINI AND MORE\", and \"THE MAGICAL WORLD OF SLYDINI\", both written by Karl Fulves. These two book sets are considered to be must-read standard classics in magical literature. Bill lectured Slydini's methods and techniques, as well as his own, to thousands of magicians in 74 cities across the US and Canada in 1976 and 1978.\n\nThere were also films, videos and countless articles on his methods and philosophies. The scientific professions also took an interest and more than ten feature articles were written about his psychological methods for distraction and in particular, willful misdirection. Scientific American published a 2015 research article entitled, \"The Neuroscience of Slydini's Paper Balls-to-Hat Magic Trick\".\n\nThe magician who taught himself continued to teach others well into his eighties.\n\nTony Slydini died of heart failure on January 15, 1991, following a lengthy illness and several years of confinement in a New Jersey nursing home. Howard Bauman, the editor of the International Brotherhood of Magician's publication, \"The Linking Ring\", wrote, \"A magical light went out on January 15, when Slydini died. For more than 40 years he had brightened the horizons of magic with his special kind of prestidigitation. Slydini was a dedicated student of magic and developed his own style of misdirection and timing that was certainly regarded as truly artistic. Tony Slydini will be missed especially by his legion of friends.\"\n\nQuintino Marucci, best known as Tony Slydini, was buried in Orange, New Jersey. New memorials, books, video and film presentations about the man who changed magic continue to be written and produced more than 25 years after his death.\n\nWhen performing, Slydini never enunciated a magic word, e.g. \"abracadabra\" or \"hocus pocus\". His subtle magical gestures made it clear that he knew something not known, and probably unknowable, to his audience. Audiences saw an elfin quality in him that was unlikely to be duplicated. He created an ambiguous persona which allowed one to believe that maybe he was an elf and that maybe he really did have magical powers. As a close-up performer, he was considered nonpareil by his peers. His almost casual manner of performing made the magical effects he offered those of true magic. His style of close-up was something that had never been seen before. He was one of the first to show close-up magic as an art in itself, rather than as a lead-in to bigger and grander illusions. Slydini's magic was impromptu and rather than follow a set sequence of tricks as most magicians did, he allowed his audience and the situation to dictate his show.\n\nOver his lifetime, Slydini received countless awards and honors from around the world including the \"Masters Fellowship\" from the Academy of Magical Arts in 1974. The Society of American Magicians made him a \"Hall of Fame – Living Legend\" inductee. He also was awarded the Academy of Magical Arts’ \"Performing Fellowship\". In 1952, he became the recipient of the first \"Star of Magic\" award given by New York's Magic Ring and was an inducted member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians’ \"Order of Merlin\".\n\n\nIn writing of Slydini's life, magician-author Karl Fulves remarked, \"There is no question that Slydini is the most influential figure in Close-Up Magic in the 20th Century. His theories and concepts, his ingenious use of psychology and misdirection, combine to produce natural magic of the highest order. To see him work is to see the nearest thing yet, to real magic.\" \"That sentiment,\" said former television talk show host Dick Cavett, \"is the one most commonly expressed by anyone having the opportunity to actually see this great magician perform.\" \n\nBest known as a master of showmanship, misdirection and close-up artistry, Slydini served as inspiration to generations of magicians, including many thousands of the famous and not-so-famous practitioners of the art.\n\nSlydini is considered by many magicians to be one of the two finest 20th-century performers, teachers, lecturers and creators of artistic sleight-of-hand magic; Dai Vernon is the other.\n\n"}

He was a founder of the National Hockey Association (NHA), owner of the Renfrew Millionaires and the founding owner of the Montreal Canadiens professional ice hockey team.\n\nBorn in Renfrew, Ontario, O'Brien played varsity hockey at the University of Toronto, then later founded two northern Ontario hockey clubs, in Cobalt, Ontario and Haileybury, Ontario. In 1909, he founded the National Hockey Association, Les Canadiens, later Montreal Canadiens, and bought the Renfrew Creamery Kings. In the 1909–10 NHA season, the Creamery Kings received the nickname \"Millionaires\" as O'Brien signed up several stars of the time to extravagant contracts, including Fred \"Cyclone\" Taylor and brothers Frank Patrick and Lester \"the Silver Fox\" Patrick, and acquired Edouard \"Newsy\" Lalonde in an attempt to win the Stanley Cup for Renfrew. The attempt was unsuccessful and he folded the team after two seasons.\n\nWhile in Montreal for business in November 1909, O'Brien was asked by the then owners of the Creamery Kings to apply to join the Canadian Hockey Association. He made the application but was turned down. Outside the hotel room where the CHA meetings were occurring he met Jimmy Gardner, manager of the Montreal Wanderers. Together, they developed the idea of starting their own league with O'Brien's Cobalt and Haileybury teams, the Wanderers and a new team \"Les Canadiens\" for Montreal to capture francophone Montrealers' interest as a rival for the Wanderers. As a result, the Montreal Canadiens were born. O'Brien only owned the team for one season. After the season, he was sued by George W. Kendall (Kennedy) owner of the Club athlétique Canadien, claiming the legal rights to the Canadiens name. A settlement was reached and on November 12, 1910 Kendall acquired the team for $7,500.\n\nOperation of the NHA teams was expensive and the NHA was forced to implement salary caps and maximum salaries. The O'Briens reduced their involvement. Whereas in 1910, four O'Brien-backed teams played in the NHA, only one, the Millionaires, played in 1910–11, O'Brien having sold the other three NHA franchises. Before the 1911–12 season the Millionaires were also no more, its players dispersed to the other NHA teams. O'Brien was never a team owner again.

{"id": "2030930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030930", "title": "Dendrophylax lindenii", "text": "Dendrophylax lindenii\n\nDendrophylax lindenii, the ghost orchid (a common name also used for \"Epipogium aphyllum\") is a perennial epiphyte from the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to Florida and Cuba. Other common names include palm polly and white frog orchid.\n\nThe specific epithet \"lindenii\" is derived from its discoverer, the Belgian plant collector Jean Jules Linden, who saw this orchid for the first time in Cuba in 1844. Much later, it was also discovered in the Everglades in Florida. The genus Dendrophylax was formerly known as Polyrrhiza.\n\n\"Dendrophylax lindenii\" is a leafless epiphyte in the tribe Vandeae, in the subfamily Epidendroideae. The plant consists mainly of a network of photosynthetic roots on a tree trunk. Its habitat is moist, swampy forest in south-western Florida, and Caribbean islands such as Cuba.\n\nThis orchid is exceptional among the monocots in that it consists of a greatly reduced stem, and its leaves have been reduced to scales. The flat, cord-like green roots constitute the bulk of the mature plant. They bear distinctive white \"track marks\", for which the technical term is s, which are believed to function partly like stomata, enabling the photosynthetic roots to perform the gas exchange necessary for respiration and photosynthesis. Chloroplasts in these flattened roots perform nearly all the plant's photosynthesis. Their outer layer is an example of the velamen typical of most epiphytic orchids. Its functions include the absorption of nutrients and water, and admission of light for photosynthesis.\n\nThe species is endangered in the wild, and cultivation has proven exceptionally difficult, but while most attempts to raise seedlings into adult plants in sterile culture end in failure, some have in fact succeeded. This orchid is listed in Appendix II of CITES and is fully protected by Florida state laws, which forbid its removal from the wild. Plants collected from the wild typically do not survive removal from their habitat, and die within a year. In the wild, \"Dendrophylax lindenii\" typically grows on the central trunk or large main branches of living trees. It seems to prefer \"Annona glabra\" (pond-apple) trees, or occasionally \"Fraxinus caroliniana\" (pop ash) trees. It tends to attach to a tree at about eye-level or a few feet higher.\n\n\"Dendrophylax lindenii\" blossoms between June and August, producing one to ten fragrant flowers that open one at a time. The flowers are white, 3–4 cm wide and 7–9 cm long. They are borne on spikes arising from the root network. Their most intense fragrance is in the early morning, the scent fruity, resembling an apple. The lower petal, the labellum, has two long, lateral tendrils that twist slightly downward, resembling the hind legs of a jumping frog. Its bracts are — thin and papery. The roots of this orchid are so well camouflaged on the tree that the flower may seem to float in mid-air, hence its name of \"ghost orchid\".\n\nThe genus \"Dendrophylax\" is a distant relative of the African and Indian Ocean genus \"Angraecum\"; at the time of the origin of the family Orchidaceae, the Atlantic Ocean was still in parts a strait, permitting their common ancestors to establish in now widely-separated Gondwanan regions.\n\nThe fig sphinx moth, \"Pachylia ficus,\" was the first insect to be scientifically described pollinating \"Dendrophylax lindenii,\" upending long-standing hypotheses about the giant sphinx moth, \"Cocytius antaeus\", as the only possible pollinator. New research suggests that based on this finding, nearly a dozen species of hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) could also serve as potential pollinators in Florida, with even more present in Cuba.\n\nPlants can be successfully grown in a terrarium-like environment, mounted bare-root on a decay-resistant, untreated wooden stock with the wood laid horizontally on top of a bed of living sphagnum moss, as the plants require high humidity and stagnant air, or, in a Wardian case or greenhouse which approximates these conditions. Plants should not be allowed to pollinate and set seed unless the plant is very large, at least 10 inches across, as plants without sufficient biomass will transfer all of their stored reserves into making a very large seed pod, and then behave much like an annual and die after seed set. These plants should be given 1/4-strength fertilizer in distilled or other low-salt water sources weekly.\n\nThe plants are intolerant of water with high levels of dissolved salts; this will result in the roots dying off from the tips. Continued exposure to chlorinated tap water will usually kill these plants, with the tips of the roots yellowing and rapidly dying back to the reduced stem. It is normal for the plants to periodically consume and dehisce older roots, but this process does not yellow the roots, they simply shrivel and turn gray, then dehisce completely. Healthy plants will exhibit vigorous lime green root tips which are in an active state of growth. The plant's root tips will grow continuously, provided they receive bright light and regular fertilization and watering, with only a short resting period in late fall/early winter. Water should never be allowed to remain standing in the roots nor should any portion of the plant's roots be immersed in standing water for any significant period of time. The key to getting these plants to grow quickly is to keep the roots moist continuously when they are small, without water standing in the roots, and regular fertilization. When the plants are small and their roots become dry, these plants cease to grow appreciably. They like to be kept moist, but not wet, to stimulate increase in biomass and active root growth when small. The roots of these plants will also tend to produce new plantlets in a starfish-like manner from broken or damaged roots or from roots which have grown longer than 12 inches, a growth habit shared with other members of the genus \"Dendrophylax\".\n\nAlthough plants in habitat occasionally experience light frost with some root tip damage, as a rule, the plants should never be subjected to freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures, except for very short periods, will kill these plants in cultivation. Blooming is triggered by subjecting the plants to a cool, dry resting period, with only very light misting every few weeks, and lowering the humidity in the growing environment for a period of several months in late fall and early winter, when the plants are large enough to support flowering, typically with a root mass of 7-8 inches across.\n\nNewly forming flowers will appear from the highly reduced stem in the center of the root mass, and are difficult to distinguish from aerial roots until the flower starts to develop. When new growth is apparent after giving the plants a resting period, resume normal watering. Plants which are large and have set seed pods should be given more frequent fertilizing and should be limited to only a single seed pod per plant by removing all but one immature seed pod. When attempting to produce seed pods from one of these plants, if the plant has multiple flowers, all of them should be hand pollinated with pollinia from a different plant, if available, and only one seed pod allowed to remain on each plant, since not all of the flowers may be successfully pollinated. When mature, the pod contains thousands of microscopic, dust-like seeds.\n\nIn habitat, successful pollination of this species appears to be an infrequent, but not rare, event. The plants also flower irregularly in habitat, and some years do not flower at all.\n\nThe plant plays a pivotal role in the non-fiction book \"The Orchid Thief\", by Susan Orlean, and the movie based on the book, \"Adaptation, \" although in the book the plant is yet in its former genus Polyrrhiza. The ghost orchid of Blair Audubon Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary also inspired the fiction novel, \"Ghost Orchid\" by D. K. Christi.\n\n\n"}

In 2013, it had an enrollment of 2,167 and a student-teacher ratio of 20:1.\n\nPearce was established in 1967 with a group of tenth graders housed at Richardson North Junior High School. Prior to 1967, all high school students in the Pearce area attended Richardson High School. In 1969, the school moved to its current home on Coit Road; the campus has been expanded several times since. Along with Berkner High School, it is one of two RISD high schools to have a natatorium. While Pearce hosts a natatorium, Eagle-Mustang Stadium is shared with Richardson High School. An indoor training facility was built in 2018 to accommodate Pearce athletes.\n\nThe racial mix of the neighborhood has remained relatively constant. There are students bused in from outside neighborhoods, mainly from lower income areas. Many families move to the Pearce area for the high caliber RISD schools. The school employs a well-qualified staff, including multiple Teacher of the Year recipients. Academic success is the primary emphasis of Pearce, with high levels of parent involvement and relatively high student participation in extra-curricular activities, displaying a proactive community.\n\nThe graduating class of 1987 was reunited on the TV Land original program \"High School Reunion\", which premiered on March 5, 2008.\n\nIn September 2017, two Pearce students were accused of creating racist memes during the week leading up to the school's annual in-town rivalry football game against Richardson High School. The most controversial meme depicted the Pearce High School logo over KKK members and the Richardson High School logo over a burning cross. Each student served an out of school suspension.\n\n\"Newsweek\" ranked Pearce at #528 in the top 1,000 high schools in the nation. Schools were ranked based on the number of students who took Advanced Placement courses and AP tests. Pearce was named a 1988-89 National Blue Ribbon School. In 2009, the state classified 81% of Pearce's graduates as \"college ready\", or ready to undergo university studies. The State of Texas defined \"college readiness\" by scores on the ACT and SAT, and in the 11th grade Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) tests. During the same year, the school's student body had 22% poor students, and 27% of its students had a risk of dropping out. Holly K. Hacker of \"The Dallas Morning News\" said that the readiness rate was about 20 points higher than statistics would predict, and that the school \"far exceeds what is expected.\"\n\nPearce High School also has an Academic Decathlon team. The school holds the record for the most national wins in United States Academic Decathlon history, claiming five first place titles and has also succeeded in being in the top ten schools in the state competition since its founding.. J.J. Pearce High School was a Recognized school for 2007-2008 as well.\n\nThe Mock Trial team of Pearce High School is widely respected across the region and remains the most prestigious program in Region 10 history. Since 1979, Pearce High School has won more regional titles than any other team in its district along with four state titles, tying for second most in Texas history.\n\n\n"}

The two episodes were split into two broadcasts; \"Part 1\" first aired on May 12, 1998 and \"Part 2\" first aired on May 19, 1998. They were written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon.\n\nThe narrative features vampire slayer Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) working to prevent Angelus (David Boreanaz) and fellow vampires Drusilla (Juliet Landau) and Spike (James Marsters) from awakening the demon Acathla.\n\nProduction of \"Becoming\" was the first time that the show had been filmed outside the usual warehouses or other locations. A studio was used for the flashback scenes set in New York and Ireland. Actors Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz undertook training for their climactic sword fight.\n\nGiles visits a museum to examine a big stone block that it has just acquired; he finds an opening in the rock.\n\nBuffy and Willow find the floppy disk containing Ms. Calendar's reconstruction of the curse that gave Angelus his soul. They are eager to attempt it so they can get Angel back. Giles warns that it will be difficult. Xander prefers to see Angelus killed, rather than risk leaving him alive merely so that Buffy can have a chance to get her boyfriend back.\n\nDrusilla kills the museum curator while Angelus and his minions steal the stone block, which contains the demon Acathla, who came to suck the world into Hell. A virtuous knight had stabbed him in the heart before he could draw a breath, but someone worthy can remove the sword to awaken Acathla. Angelus wants to use Acathla to destroy the world.\n\nKendra, the new Slayer, returns to Sunnydale bringing a sword blessed by the same knight who stopped Acathla.\n\nAngelus kills a human and uses his blood in an attempt to awaken Acathla, which fails. He then lures Buffy to a battle so that his minions can kidnap Giles, whom he plans to torture for the information he needs. In the library, Willow is attempting the curse when vampires attack. Giles is taken while Xander is injured and Willow is knocked unconscious under a bookcase. Drusilla hypnotizes and kills Kendra. Buffy arrives too late, and a policeman finds her with Kendra's body.\n\n\nAngelus tortures Giles for information and entertainment. Buffy finds Whistler in Giles' apartment and they discuss Angel's reversion to Angelus. He reveals that Angel was destined to stop Acathla not awaken him.\n\nBuffy is nearly arrested, but Spike attacks the policeman and offers a temporary alliance. He has no wish to see the world destroyed, and is jealous of Angelus' attentions to Drusilla; he will help Buffy stop Angelus if she allows him and Drusilla to leave town. Buffy and Spike go to her house to talk, but meet Joyce. Buffy is forced to tell her about her role as a vampire slayer. Joyce tells her daughter not to come back if she leaves the house. Buffy leaves anyway.\n\nXander sits by the comatose Willow and confesses his love for her. She wakes up, but the first person she asks for is Oz. Willow is determined to try the curse again. She sends Xander to tell Buffy her plans, hoping she can stall until the curse is complete.\n\nBuffy goes to the library to retrieve Kendra's sword. She encounters Snyder, who gleefully announces that she is expelled. Spike returns to the mansion, concealing that he is well enough to walk. To keep Angelus from killing Giles, Spike suggests that Drusilla use hypnosis. She appears to Giles as Jenny, and he tells her that Angelus is the key. He must use his own blood, not someone else's, to awaken Acathla.\n\nBuffy returns to Whistler, who tells her that if Angelus has awoken Acathla, only Angelus' blood can again defeat him, in the process sending both evil beings to hell. On her way to the mansion she meets Xander, who decides not to pass on Willow's message.\n\nIn the mansion, Buffy announces her arrival by decapitating a minion. Spike surprises Angelus from behind, knocking him unconscious and proceeding to beat him brutally. To his dismay, Drusilla sides with her sire, defending Angelus and attacking Spike. Xander frees the injured Giles and they escape as Spike and Buffy fight against Drusilla and the remaining minions. Angelus regains his senses and removes the sword from Acathla; he and Buffy swordfight. Spike knocks Drusilla unconscious and escapes with her in his car, leaving Sunnydale. Angelus overpowers Buffy and continues to torment her.\n\nAt the hospital, just as Willow appears close to fainting, she suddenly regains strength and begins incanting in Romanian. She succeeds in restoring Angel's soul just as Buffy is about to kill Angelus. Buffy realizes that Angel is back and embraces him. She then sees that Acathla is awake as it opens its mouth and creates an expanding vortex. When Angel, oblivious to the vortex opening behind him, questions what happened and where he is, Buffy kisses him, professes her love and then drives her sword through him into the vortex. Angel is sucked into the closing hellish vortex and the world is saved. Distraught at losing her lover and knowing that she has been expelled from school, Buffy departs from Sunnydale on a bus while her friends regroup at school unsure if or when she will return.\n\n\nThe score to \"Becoming\" won Christophe Beck a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series.\n"}

{"id": "2030955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030955", "title": "Nheengatu", "text": "Nheengatu\n\nThe Nheengatu language (, ), often spelled Nhengatu, is an indigenous language of the Americas from the Tupi–Guarani language family. The name of the language is derived from the words \"nhe'eng\" (meaning \"tongue\" or \"to speak\") and \"katu\" (meaning \"good\"). The name of the related language Ñheengatu, in Paraguay, is similarly derived. Nheengatu is referred to by a large variety of names in literature, including \"Nhengatu\", \"Coastal Tupian\", \"Geral\", \"Yeral\" (in Venezuela), \"Modern Tupí\", \"Nyengato\", \"Nyengatú\", \"Waengatu\", \"Neegatú\", \"Is’engatu\", \"Língua Brasílica\" and \"Tupi Amazônico\". It is also commonly referred to as Língua Geral Amazônica (LGA) in Brazil.\n\nSpeakers of Nheengatu can be found in the Upper Rio Negro region, with a close variety spoken in the Middle Rio Negro region. More specifically, speakers can be found in the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the state of Amazonas in Brazil, where Nheengatu has been made an official language (alongside Karu, Tukano and Portuguese) since 2002. Speakers can also be found in the neighbouring countries of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nThere are around 2000 speakers in Venezuela, 3000 in Colombia, and around 3000 in Brazil. However, there are inconsistencies across literature with regards to the number of speakers of Nheengatu: the Summer Institute of Linguistics gives an estimate of 3000 speakers in Brazil, where as other sources have cited the speakers to be at around 30,000 (Ângelo, 1998), which is highly unlikely based on the total population of 41,885 of São Gabriel da Cachoeira.\n\nThere are perhaps around 19,000 Nheengatu speakers worldwide according to \"The Ethnologue\" (2005), although some journalists have reported as many as 30,000. The language has recently regained some recognition and prominence after having been suppressed for many years. It is spoken in the Upper Rio Negro region of Amazonas state, in the Brazilian Amazon, and in neighboring portions of Colombia and Venezuela. It is the native language of the area's rural population, and it is also used as a common language of communication between Indians and non-Indians, and between Indians from different tribes. Its use is also a way for some of the native peoples who have lost their original languages to affirm their ethnic identity, as in the case of the Barés, the Arapaços, the Baniwa people, the Werekena and others.\n\nIn 1998, University of São Paulo professor Eduardo de Almeida Navarro founded the organization \"Tupi Aqui\" (Tupi Here) dedicated to promoting the teaching of historic Tupi and Nheengatu in high schools in São Paulo and elsewhere in Brazil. Professor Navarro has written a textbook for the teaching of Nheengatu which Tupi Aqui makes available, together with other teaching materials, on a website hosted by the University of São Paulo.\n\nIn December 2002, Nheengatu gained the status of official language alongside Portuguese in the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil, where many speakers are concentrated, pursuant to local law 145/2002.\n\nEthnologue classifies Nheengatu as “shifting”, with a ranking of 7 on the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS) (Simons and Fennig 2017). According to this scale, this rating suggests that “the child-bearing population can use the language amongst themselves, but it is not being transmitted to children”. According to the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, Nheengatu is classified as “severely endangered” (Moseley 2010).\n\nTo understand Nheengatu as it exists today, it is crucial to understand its historical origins and its evolution. Moore (2014) documents the historical development of Nheengatu, which is a case of language contact that has stretched over five hundred years, ever since the Portuguese landed in Brazil in 1500. Upon European contact, there was a lot of cultural and commercial exchange. European men also sought after local women and started families, producing children (or mestizos) who would speak their native language, which is the now-extinct precursor of Nheengatu called Tupinambá (also known as Brasílica or Coastal Tupi). Europeans also learned this language in order for them to act as middlemen, and Tupinambá went on to be used in the colony after the Portuguese settled down in the new lands permanently. By the mid-16th century, Jesuits arrived in Bahia, Brazil. These missionaries were active learners of the native languages, even producing language manuals. Better-known linguistic works from the 16th and early 17th century are \"Arte da Grammatica da Lingoa mais usada na costa do Brasil\" by Father José de Anchieta (1595) and \"Arte da Língua Brasilíca\" by Luis Figueira (1621).\n\nAmazonia was established as the second colony at the beginning of the 17th century. At the mouth of the Amazon, the state of Maranhão was linguistically diverse, and faced an influx of immigrants from Brazil who spoke Tupinambá: “Indians, whites, blacks, mulattos and mestizos leaving their homes in Brazil to populate the northern colony brought the Brasílica with them”. The number of speakers of other languages immensely outnumbered the Portuguese settlers in this second colony. With this influx of immigrants from Brazil, Tupinambá was the language that people would go to within the colony. (Rodrigues 1996a and Freire 2004)\n\nLíngua Geral was established as an official language from 1689-1727, after which Portuguese was promoted instead, but to no avail. By the mid 18th century, Língua Geral Amazônica (distinct from Língua Geral Paulista, a similar variety used farther south) was used throughout the colony. At this point, Tupinambá remained intact, but as a “liturgical language”. The languages used in daily life had evolved drastically over the century due to language contact, with Tupinambá as the “language of the ritual acts, and Língua Geral Amazônica the language of popular communication and, therefore, of religious instruction”. Moore (2014) observes that by the mid-18th century, Língua Geral Amazônica and Tupinambá were already distinct from each other. By then, the original Tupinambá community was facing a decline, but other speech communities were still required by the Portuguese missionaries to learn the Tupinambá language. Efforts to communicate between communities resulted in the ‘corruption’ of the Tupinambá language, hence the distinction between Tupinambá and Língua Geral Amazônica.\n\nAlso during the mid 18th century, however, the indigenous population then faced a sharp decline due to disease, being forced into hard labour and being oppressed by their Portuguese colonisers. There was an active push by the colonisers to increase the Portuguese presence: villages were eradicated along the Amazon, and there was an effort to replace Língua Geral Amazônica with Portuguese. There were different varieties of Tupinambá within the different communities along the Amazon, but these varieties were large replaced by Portuguese at the beginning of the 19th century. 1822 marked Brazil’s independence; after which there was a large revolt, called the Cabanagem, against the Europeans. This involved Indians, caboclos and blacks, over a decade, and much blood was shed. 40,000 lives were lost; all of which were from the Nheengatu-speaking community. With the increase in immigration due to urbanization, remaining speakers of Língua Geral Amazônica, or Nheengatu, were pushed to more remote areas in western Amazonia. Linguistic documents were also published during this time, due to increased interest in Nheengatu.\n\nNheengatu continued to evolve in the 20th century, as it expanded in the Upper Rio Negro region. There was contact with other languages such as Baré, Baniwa, Warekana, Tukano and Dâw (Cabalzar; Ricardo 2006 in Cruz 2015) Due to significant economic and political events such as the Rubber Booms, Portuguese presence was once again felt due to these events, forcing indigenous populations to relocate or into hard labour. Their language, naturally, was once again influenced with the increased presence of Portuguese speakers.\n\nHence, Nheengatu has evolved tremendously over the course of time, since its origins as Tupinambá.\n\nNheengatu developed from the now-extinct Tupinambá language, and belongs to the Tupi-Guarani branch of the Tupi language family. The Tupi-Guarani language family accounts for a large, diverse group of languages “including, for example, Xetá, Sirionó, Araweté, Ka’apor, Kamayurá, Guajá, and Tapirapé”. Many of these languages had differentiated years before the Portuguese arrived in Brazil. Over time, the term Tupinambá was employed to describe groups that were “linguistically and culturally related”, even though the original tribe was mostly gone.\n\nOver the course of its evolution since its beginnings as Tupinambá, extensive research has been done on Nheengatu. There have been studies done at each phase of its evolution, but much has been focused on how aspects of Nheengatu, such as its grammar or phonology, have changed upon contact over the years. (Facundes et al. 1994 and Rodrigues 1958, 1986).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the first documents that were produced were by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as \"Arte da Grammatica da Lingoa mais usada na costa do Brasil\" by Father José de Anchieta (1595) and \"Arte da Língua Brasilíca\" by Luis Figueira (1621). These were detailed grammars that served their religious purposes. Multiple dictionaries have also been written over the years (Mello 1967, Grenand and Epaminondas 1989, Barbosa 1951). More recently, Stradelli (2014) also published a Portuguese-Nheengatu dictionary.\n\nThere have also been several linguistic studies of Nheengatu more recently, such as Borges (1991)’s thesis on Nheengatu phonology and Cruz (2011)’s detailed paper on the phonology and grammar of Nheengatu. She also studied the rise of number agreement in modern Nheengatu, by analyzing how grammaticalization occurred over the course of its evolution from Tupinambá (Cruz 2015). Cruz (2014) also studies reduplication in Nheengatu in detail, as well as morphological fission in bitransitive constructions. A proper textbook for the conducting of Nheengatu classes has also been written. (Navarro 2011). Lima and Sirvana (2017) provides a sociolinguistic study of Nheengatu in the Pisasu Sarusawa community of the Baré people, in Manaus, Amazonas.\n\nLanguage documentation agencies (such as SOAS, Museu do Índio, Museu Goeldi and Dobes) are currently not engaged in any language documentation project for Nheengatu. However, research on Nheengatu by Moore (1994) was supported by Museu Goeldi and the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq), and funded by the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (SSILA) and the Inter-American Foundation. In this study, Moore focused on the effects of language contact, and how Nheegatu evolved over the years with the help of a Nheegatu-speaking informant. Moore (2014) urges for the “location and documentation of modern dialects of Nheegatu”, due to their risk of becoming extinct.\n\nAnthropological research has been done on the changing cultural landscapes along the Amazon, as well as life of the Tupinambá people and their interactions with the Jesuits. Floyd (2007) describes how populations navigate between their “traditional” and “acculturated” spheres. Other studies have focused on the impact of urbanization on Indigenous populations in the Amazon (de Oliveira 2001).\n\nParentheses mark marginal phonemes occurring only in few words, or with otherwise unclear status.\n\nThere are eight word classes in Nheengatu: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, postpositions, pronouns, demonstratives and particles. These eight word classes are also reflected in Cruz (2011)’s \"Fonologia e Gramática do Nheengatú\". In her books, Cruz includes 5 chapters in the Morphology section that describes lexical classes, nominal and verbal lexicogenesis, the structure of the noun phrase and grammatical structures. In the section on lexical classes, Cruz discusses personal pronominal prefixes, nouns and their subclasses (including personal, anaphoric and demonstrative pronouns as well as relative nouns), verbs and their subclasses (such as stative, transitive and intransitive verbs) and adverbial expressions. The subsequent chapter on nominal lexicogenesis discusses endocentric derivation, nominalization and nominal composition. Under verbal lexicogenesis in Chapter 7, Cruz covers valency, reduplication and the borrowing of loanwords from Portuguese. The following chapter then discusses the distinction between particles and clitics, including examples and properties of each grammatical structure.\n\nThere are two types of pronouns in Nheengatu: personal or interrogative. Nheengatu follows the same pattern as Tupinambá, in that the same set of personal pronouns is adopted for the subject and object of a verb.\n\nExamples of Personal Pronouns in use:\n\nAs observed in Table 3, in Nheengatu, personal pronouns can also take the form of prefixes. These prefixes are necessary in the usage of verbs as well as postpositions. In the latter case, free forms of the pronouns are not permitted. Moore illustrates this with the following:\n\nThe free form of the first person singular pronoun cannot be combined with the postposition word for ‘with’.\n\nThe second set of pronouns are interrogative, and are used in question words.\n\nAccording to Moore (2014), throughout the evolution of Nheengatu, processes such as compounding were greatly reduced. Moore cites a summary by Rodrigues (1986), stating that Nheegatu lost Tupinambá’s system of five moods (indicative, imperative, gerund, circumstantial and subjunctive), converging into a single indicative mood. Despite such changes alongside influences from Portuguese, however, derivational and inflectional affixation was still intact from Tupinambá. A select number of modern affixes arose via grammaticization of what used to be lexical items. For example, Moore (2014) provides the example of the former lexical item ‘etá’, which means ‘many’. Over time and grammaticization, this word became to plural suffix ‘-itá’.\n\nApart from the pronominal prefixes shown in Table (3), there are also verbal prefixes. Verbs in Nheengatu fall into three mutually exclusive categories: intransitive, transitive and stative. By attaching verbal prefixes to these verbs, a sentence can be considered well-formed.\n\nExamples of verbal prefixes:\n\nIn these examples from Moore (2014), the verbal first person singular prefix ‘a-’ is added to the intransitive verb for ‘work’ and transitive verb for ‘make’ respective. Only when prefixed with this verbal clitic, can they be considered well-formed sentences.\n\nAnother interesting morphological feature of Nheengatu is reduplication, which Cruz (2011) explains in her grammar to employed differently based on the community of Nheengatu speakers. This is a morphological process that was originally present in Tupinambá, and it tends to be used to indicate a repeated action.\n\nIn this example, the reduplicated segment is \"tuka\", which is the Nheengatu verb for ‘knock’. This surfaces as a fully reduplicated segment. However, partial reduplication also occurs in this language. In the following example elicited by Cruz, the speaker reduplicates the first two syllables (a CVCV sequence) of the stem word.\n\nAnother point to note from the above example is the usage of the plural word \"ita\". Cruz (2011) highlights that there is a distinction in the usage of reduplication between communities. The speakers of Içana and the upper region of the Rio Negro use Nheengatu as their main language, and reduplication occurs in the stative verbs, expressing intensity of a property, and the plural word \"ita\" doesn't necessarily need to be used. On the other hand, in Santa Isabel do Rio Negro and the more urban area of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, speakers tend to be bilingual, with Portuguese used as the main language. In this context, these speakers also employ reduplication to indicate the intensity of a property, but the plural \"ita\" must be used if the subject is plural.\n\nIn her description of the phonology and grammar of Nheengatu, Cruz (2011) writes that there are two strategies in Nheengatu that express valency change, which involves the transformation of verbs. As Cruz (2011) explains in a previous chapter, transitive verbs are defined syntactically by their ability to select two arguments, while intransitives allow the selection of only one argument. This division is marked morphologically distinctly in Nheengatu. Intransitive verbs need to be morphologically transformed so they can select two arguments, and vice versa. There are two morphological operations that allow to change valency:\n\n\nAccording to Cruz, it is not possible for the same verb to function either as transitive or as intransitive. The identification of morphemes as valency-change operators takes only syntactic criteria into consideration. However, from a semantic point of view, Cruz notes that these morphemes are somewhat restricted in the type of thematic role that the inserted (or demoted) argument can receive. Cause-derived verbs select a subject that receives the thematic role CAUSER. On the other hand, verbs derived by the 'reflexive / reciprocal' morpheme select a single argument, characterized at the same time as AGENT and PATIENT.\n\nThe causative mu- is used to increase the valence of intransitive predicates. According to Cruz, it is a highly productive process, which allows nouns and intransitive verbs (both dynamic and stative) to be derived as transitive verbs. Cruz provides the following two examples to illustrate this process:\n\nExample 1a illustrates a dynamic intransitive verb, while example 1b indicates how possessing the \"mu-\" causative morpheme changes the argument. Similarly, example 2a illustrates stative intransitive verbs, which becomes a transitive predicate in 2b.\n\nCruz (2011) also provides the following table to illustrate more examples of dynamic intransitive verbs with the causative morpheme:\n\nAccording to Cruz, nouns can also be combined with the causative. In a previous chapter, Cruz describes how a noun phrase can occur as a noun predicate, which selects an argument to function as the subject. The causative morpheme allows an increase of valency of this predicate. As a result of this operation, the noun is transformed into a transitive verb. In semantic terms (Cruz (2011: 288)), the transitive predicate formed from a noun can be interpreted as a “transfer relation”, in which a CAUSER is generated, and in relation to the entity referred to by the original noun, affects a CAUSEE. This is illustrated in the example below:\nLiterally: “I am going to make medicine on my son’s wound”\n\nCruz (2011) provides the following table, based on data she collected from Grenand and Ferreira (1989)’s dictionary:\n\nThe second operation that Cruz (2011) provides is the reflexive/reciprocal prefix \"yu-\". This operator of valence adjustment allows the transformation of transitive verbs into intransitive ones. The morpheme expresses that subject is interpreted as both AGENT and PATIENT at the same time. The referents involved may be identical, allowing a 'reflexive' interpretation. This is illustrated in examples (4) and (5) below. The statements in (a) are simple transitive predicates, of which the intransitive forms in (b) are derived.\ncontext: Order given to a woman in labour.\n\nHowever, Cruz (2011: 296) also notes that in Nheengatu, there could be ambiguous interpretations, because of how both reciprocal and reflexive expressions are expressed the same way. She explains that “nothing prevents the single argument from the verb derived from reflexive to be plural”.\n\nAccording to Cruz (2011:269), a nominal phrase in Nheengatu can be determined by “discrete quantifiers”, used to specify the quantity of an entity or by “continuous quantifiers”, used to indicate an imprecise number of entities.\n\nDiscrete quantification involves numerals, illustrated in Table 3 below. The basic numbers (one to five), as Cruz (2011) lists, can be combined in order to form larger numbers.\n\nDespite the existence of these numbers, however, speakers of Nheengatu tend to use the cardinal numbers borrowed from Portuguese. Numerals in Nheengatu occur before the lexical nouns, without the need for a classifier. This is illustrated in the following examples (6) (containing a Nheengatu numeral) and (7) (which contains a borrowed Portuguese numeral):\n\nHowever, Cruz also notes that it is possible for numerals to occur without the lexical noun. She cites two possible interpretations: a) there exists a lexical noun functioning as the nucleus, that is also an ellipsis, or 2) that the numeral itself is functions the nucleus and noun. Citing that the numeral falls under the scope of the plural morpheme ita in example (8) below, Cruz opts for the interpretation that these numerals function as nouns:\n\nIn a sub-section, Cruz (2011) also discusses the nominal status of numerals in Nheengatu. She compares the tendency for numerals to be classified as adverbs in other Tupi-Guaraní languages (such as Kamaiura, where numerals are nominalized to function as an argument). In contrast, numerals in Nheengatu do not behave like adverbs and in fact have a fixed position in the noun phrase. Additionally, they can function as an argument without needing to be nominalized.\n\nAnother characteristic that is typical in languages where numerals are classified as adverbs is the allowance of the numeral to indicate a certain number of events. Cruz provides an example from Karitiana (also of the Tupi trunk):\n\nIn this example, the event of eating monkey occurred twice, and, consequently, implies that there were two monkeys. In Nheengatu, however, the occurrences of an event must be marked by (numeral/mui) viagi, which is a combination of either a numeral or the continuous quantifier mui, and the noun viagi (which is a loanword from Portuguese for ‘trip’, that has come to denote a more abstract sense of time. This change now indicates the number of occurrences of an event.) This is illustrated in Example (9) below: \n\nThis example illustrates that the eating event affected two entities. Compare this with (10):\n\nIn this example, the quantifier affects the number of events, indicating the repeated occurrence of the eating event.\n\nIn this category, the quantifiers determining noun phrases are examined. Cruz (2011) first addresses two of such quantifiers: \"panhe\" ‘all’ and \"mui(ri)\" “many” (the latter of which is derived from the Portuguese word \"muito\" or the Spanish \"muy\"). Examples (1) to (3) illustrate these quantifiers:\n\nAnother continuous quantifier that Cruz introduces is siya, which denotes ‘several entities”. She describes this quantifier as being more semantically specific than the previous two. In syntactical terms, it can function as an argument or a predicate, allowing it to be interpreted as “various entities”.\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of approximately of land, including Lion Rock and Mong Fu Shek (Amah Rock) and their surrounding scenic hillsides, of which is forestry plantation.\n\nThe dominant topographical feature of the park is the Lion Rock, which from some angles resembles a lion perching on a hill ridge.\n\nAnother topographical feature of the park is the Mong Fu Shek (Amah Rock). The legend is that of a faithful wife who climbed the hills every day, carrying her son, to watch for the return of her husband, not knowing he had been drowned at sea. In reward for her faithfulness she was turned into a rock by the Goddess of the Sea so that her spirit could unite with that of her husband.\n\nBeacon Hill is another landscape feature of the park. Its Chinese name derives from the warning fire signals which were lit during the Qing Dynasty on the hill top, which was one of the many \"lookouts\" guarded by soldiers to alert surrounding areas to danger from pirates or hostile intruders. Today a radar station and a police transmitter occupy the top of the hill.\n\nFrom the slopes of Golden Hill and several places along the western ridge at the park, magnificent panoramic views can be enjoyed. From these localities the whole length of Smugglers Ridge, Tai Mo Shan (the highest peak in Hong Kong), Needle Hill, Sha Tin New Town, Lion Rock and Beacon Hill can be seen. The northern part of Kowloon, the western anchorage of the harbour, and Stonecutters Island, the housing estates of Kwai Chung, the container port, the industrial parts of Tsing Yi Island and the town of Tsuen Wan can also be viewed from these vantage points.\n\nThe Lion Rock area has long been a favourite for picnickers, hikers and tourists because it includes scenic spots such as Lion Rock, Beacon Hill and Mong Fu Shek.\n\nThe more common species in the area include \"Pinus elliottii\" (Slash Pine), \"Myrica rubra\" (the Strawberry Tree), \"Schefflera octophylla\" (the Ivy Tree), \"Reevesia thyrsoidea\" (Reevesia), \"Phyllostachys aurea\" (Fishpole Bamboo), \"Enkianthus quinqueflorus\" (the Lunar New Year Bellflower) and species of Melastoma.\n\nThe area is specially noted for two species of wildlife, the black-eared kite and the long-tailed macaque.\n\nThe black-eared kite is a migratory bird found in Asia and Australia. It is a scavenger, feeding on offal, carrion, refuse and dead fish in the harbour. Eagle's Nest, a well wooded ridge in the park, is one of the popular nesting areas near the harbour, probably because of the presence of tall pine trees.\n\nThe long-tailed macaques present in this area are not local wildstock but are descendants of monkeys released in 1920. Their food includes leaves, fruits, insects and small animals. It is illegal to feed monkeys. They can attack and inflict painful bites on human being, especially in their mating season or when they have their young with them.\n\nVarieties of granite which occur include Sung Kong, Cheung Chau and Ma On Shan Granites. In some places the granites are cut by quartz veins containing, amongst other minerals, wolframite, which is tungsten-bearing.\n\nLion Rock has long been a favorite crag for multi-pitch rock climbers in Hong Kong: in fact, the first modern rock climbs in the territory were completed by RAF personnel stationed at Kai Tak Airport in the 1950s.\nOwing to the most convenient transport, people enjoy themselves in the parks with different kinds of activities, such as morning walking and hiking. Particularly on Sunday and Public Holiday, it is very busy in the parks. There are jogging trails, morning walker gardens and barbecue sites etc. provided in the parks.\n\nAn extensive network of footpaths has been laid out in the park providing access to almost every part or the park. MacLehose Trail - Stages 5 and 6 starts from Sha Tin Pass to Shing Mun Reservoir. Wilson Trail - Stage 6 begins from Tai Po Road to Shing Mun Reservoir Main Dam via Smugglers Ridge (Ma Tse Keng).\n\nWithin the park there is a waymarked family walk provided for family users.\n\nSurrounding the Reception and Shek Lei Pui reservoirs are two jogging trails specially designed for visitors who enjoy morning exercises and keeping fit.\n\nMoreover, there is a tree walk to guide visitors who wish to know more about trees in the park.\n\nA 15-station fitness trail, with specially designed equipment, is located on the catchwater track leading eastwards from the Tai Po Road near 51 milestone. In the western part of the park there is a nature trail which provides an opportunity for studying the natural history and geography of the area.\n\nThere is no road access to the Lion Rock Country Park; walkers may enter by footpaths via Hung Mui Kuk, Tsok Pok Hang from Sha Tin, or via Wang Tau Hom from Kowloon and from Tai Po Road via the catchwater footpath near Kowloon Reservoir.\n\n\n\n"}

The nodes produce white blood cells (lymphocytes) that fight infections. When an infection is present, the lymph nodes swell, produce more white blood cells, and attempt to trap the organisms that are causing the infection. The lymph nodes also try to trap cancer cells.\n\nThe test is used to help determine the cause of lymph node enlargement (swollen glands or lymphadenitis). It may also determine whether tumors in the lymph node are cancerous or noncancerous. Enlarged lymph nodes may be caused by a number of conditions, ranging from very mild infections to serious malignancies. Benign conditions can often be distinguished from cancerous and infectious processes by microscopic examination. The pathologist may also perform additional tests on the lymph node tissue to assist in making a diagnosis.\n\nSome of the conditions where abnormal values are obtained are:\n\nLymph node biopsies may be performed to evaluate the spread of cancer. See Lymphadenectomy#With_sentinel_node_biopsy.\n\nHowever, Sentinel lymph node biopsy for evaluating early, thin melanoma has not been shown to improve survival, and for this reason, should not be performed. Patients with melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm have a low risk of cancer spreading to lymph nodes and high 5-year survival rates, so this kind of biopsy is unnecessary.\n\nThe test is done in an operating room in a hospital, or at an outpatient surgical facility. There are two ways the sample may be obtained:\n\n\nA needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into a node to obtain the sample.\n\nThe patient lies on the examination table; the biopsy site is cleansed; and a local anesthetic is injected. The biopsy needle is then inserted into the node. A sample is removed, pressure is applied to the site to stop the bleeding, and a bandage is applied.\n\nAn open biopsy consists of surgically removing all or part of a node.\n\nThe patient lies on the examination table and is given a sedative. The skin over the biopsy site is cleansed, and a local anesthetic is injected (occasionally, a general anesthetic is given). A small incision is made, and the lymph node or part of the node is removed. The incision is then closed with stitches and bandaged.\n\nThe sample is then sent to pathology.\n\nWith this test there is a small chance of infection or bleeding. Additionally, there is a moderate risk of nerve injury, localized paralysis, or numbness when the biopsy is performed on a lymph node close to nerves.\n\n"}

{"id": "2030992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030992", "title": "John Parker (captain)", "text": "John Parker (captain)\n\nJohn Parker (July 13, 1729 – September 17, 1775) was an American colonial farmer, smith, soldier, and colonial militia officer who commanded the Lexington, Patriot, colonial militia at the Battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775.\n\nJohn Parker was born in Lexington, Massachusetts to Josiah Parker and Anna Stone. He was a descendant of Deacon Thomas Parker, founder of Reading, Massachusetts. John Parker was also the grandfather of reformer and abolitionist Theodore Parker. John Parker's experience as a soldier in the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), at the Siege of Louisbourg, and the conquest of Quebec most likely, led to his election, as militia captain, by the men of the town. He was dying from consumption (tuberculosis), on the morning of April 19, 1775, and had not quite five months left to live.\n\nOn April 19, 1775 the British commander in Boston Thomas Gage dispatched an expedition of approximately 700 army regulars under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith to search the town of Concord for hidden rebel supplies and weapons caches. Lexington lay directly on the road that Smith's men took to reach Concord.\n\nWhen reports of the approaching British force reached Lexington overnight, men from the town and the surrounding area began to rally on the Common. Parker's Lexington company were not minutemen, as sometimes stated, but from the main body of Massachusetts Militia. Parker was initially uncertain as to exactly what was happening. Conflicting stories arrived and as the British regulars had spent much of the winter engaged in harmless route marches through the Massachusetts countryside their exact intention was far from certain.\n\nWhen Smith became aware that the countryside had been alarmed and that resistance might be encountered, he sent a detachment of light infantry under Major John Pitcairn ahead of the main column. Pitcairn's advance guard reached Lexington first and drew up on the Common opposite Parker's men. Parker ordered his men to disperse to avoid a confrontation, but they either failed to hear him or ignored his instructions. Shortly afterwards firing broke out despite the fact that both sides had orders not to shoot. In the following fight eight militia were killed and ten wounded while one British soldier was wounded. The lopsided casualty list led to initial reports of a massacre, stories of which spread rapidly around the colony further inflaming the situation. There remains considerable doubt as to exactly what occurred during the fight at Lexington, and a variety of different accounts emerged as to what had taken place and who had fired first. By the time Smith arrived with his main body of troops ten minutes later, he had trouble restoring order amongst his troops, who had chased fleeing militiamen into the fields around the town. Smith then decided, in spite of the fighting, to continue the march to Concord.\n\nOne of Parker's company, many years later, recalled Parker's order at Lexington Green to have been, \"\"Stand your ground. Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.\"\" Paul Revere recalled it as having been \"\"Let the soldiers pass by. Do not molest them without they begin first\"\". During the skirmish Parker witnessed his cousin Jonas Parker killed by a British bayonet. Later that day he rallied his men to attack the regulars returning to Boston in an ambush known as \"Parker's Revenge\".\n\nParker and his men participated in the subsequent Siege of Boston. He was unable to serve in the Battle of Bunker Hill in June, and died of tuberculosis on September 17, 1775, aged 46.\n\nParker and his wife, Lydia (Moore) Parker had seven children: Lydia, Anna, John, Isaac, Ruth, Rebecca and Robert. The Parker homestead formerly stood on Spring Street in Lexington. A tablet marks the spot as the birthplace of a grandson, Theodore Parker, a Unitarian minister, transcendentalist and abolitionist who also donated two of Captain Parker's muskets to the state of Massachusetts; one the light fowling-piece which he carried at Quebec and Lexington and one that he captured. They hang today in the Senate Chamber of the Massachusetts State House.\n\nThe statue known as \"The Lexington Minuteman\" (1900) was originally meant to represent the common Minuteman, but has now commonly become accepted as symbolizing Parker. It is by Henry Hudson Kitson and it stands at the town green of Lexington, Massachusetts. It was not based on Parker's appearance, as no known likenesses of him survive today and the figure is of a younger, healthy man which Parker at that point was not. One description of Parker was \"a stout, large framed man, of medium height, somewhat like his illustrious grandson, Theodore Parker, in personal appearance, but had a much longer face.\"\n\nThe United States Army Reserve (USAR), which consists primarily of part-time duty personnel, adopted John Parker as a symbol of their motto, \"Twice the Citizen\". Though no image of Parker exists, the 'only official logo of the United States Army Reserve\" is referred to as \"The John Parker\".\n\n\n"}

The shape of the lake is a nearly-half-circle-moon shape. Kwan Phayao is the largest freshwater lake in the northern region and the fourth largest in the country, with a depth of 1.5 metres, and covers an area of about 1,980 hectares. There are about 50 species of fish. Phayao is about 691 kilometres from Bangkok and covers an area of 6,335 square kilometres.\n\nKwan Phayao began from the collapse of lithosphere in about 70 million years ago. This area was surrounded by low mountains before. There are 18 creeks mixing together here. In 1935, the department of fisheries had set up Phayao inland fisheries station on Ing River and made the dam, which cause a large swamp with a depth of 1.5 metres. “Nong Lang” was one of the most prominent ponds. The land at the northern and southern ends of the area during summer is dry, so it is possible to walk through the area.\nBefore 1941, Kwan Phayao was a vast area of lowlands. It was humid in the rainy season (around July to November). The Ing River flowed through the area, creating many large ponds called “nong” and smaller ones called “buak”. The floodwaters made waterways connected with each other creating two lakes, one called “Kwan Noi” which means small lake, located in the west. The other one called “Kwan Laung,” located in the east, near the right part of Ing River. In the dry season, the local people went there for fishing, it was overcrowded and no one was able to control the situation. Another problem is that the water was getting low in every year. The Department of Fisheries decided to build the floodgate in 1939 and finished in 1941. However, it was flooded over the field, house, temple, and archaeological site, creating lots of damage. The natural swamps changed into large reservoirs. The Department of Fisheries established a fisheries research station at Kwan Phayao to breed fish for the lake as part of the campaign to increase the availability of cheap protein diet for public consumption. Aquatic flora from Kham Phayao are used as animal feed. Kwan Phayao is rich in natural resources that aid in providing the people of Phayao with a relatively comfortable life.\n\nIn the past, Phayao area was the area where water from the mountains flowed into streams, rivers, and became small swamps during the dry season every year. The lessening of water makes the farmers able to use the area for farming, raise animals, and use as the route from the city to the surrounding villages of Phayao. The area of Kwan Phayao was the urban area which had lot of temples before. Later, when the Department of Fisheries created a water gate in Phayao to keep water, the temple was submerged in the area.\n\nBy 2009, the lake had become a shallow, degraded water source. It was clogged with weeds. Sediment had decreased its depth. Fish stocks had dwindled. The Hydro and Agro Informatics Institute (HAII) and other agencies, inspired by King Bhumibol Adulyadej's emphasis on water management, stepped in to rejuvenate the lake. Dikes were built to trap sediment, unwanted weeds were removed and used for animal feed, and the lake was stocked with native fish. As a result, the water storage capacity of the lake increased by 370,000 cubic metres. As a result, water from the lake was able to provide for 16,500 nearby families and 43,785 rai of farmland.\n\nThe river, including the shore is very fertile. The community existed since ancient time. The temperature of the area is ranges from 19.5 to 27.5 Celsius. The average rainfall per year is around 1,064 mm. There are 36 recorded different varieties of aquatic plants in Kwan Phayao. The major underwater plants are \"Ceratophyllum demersum\" and \"Najas graminea\" while other plants mainly include \"Slavonia cucullata\", \"Nelumbo nucifera\", \"Eichhornia crassipes\", and \"Scrirpus grossus\". The estimated mass of fishing crop per hectare is approximately 159 kilograms. Humidity in the area ranges from 70 to 80 percent.\n\nThe estimated mass of fish harvest per hectare is approximately 159 kilograms. There are about 50 species of fish:<br>striped catfish, black-eared catfish, cyprinidae, carp, nile tilapia, climbing perch, striped snakehead, great white sheatfish, whitebait, bagrid catfishes, cat fish, swamp eel, dace, globe fish, spotted featherback, snake skin gourami, moonlight gourami, Siamese rock catfish, minnow, abramine)\n\nThere are water hyacinths, different types of grasses, duckweed, seaweed, lotus, and the chestnuts. The water hyacinth occupies about one-third of the area of Kwan Phayao. The grasses are of different types: Johnson grass (หญ้าปล้อง) and Leucas aspera (หญ้าเค้านก) are seen in the dry season, when water decreases.\n"}
{"id": "2031045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031045", "title": "Hardware acceleration", "text": "Hardware acceleration\n\nIn computing, hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware specially made to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). Any transformation of data or routine that can be computed, can be calculated purely in software running on a generic CPU, purely in custom-made hardware, or in some mix of both. An operation can be computed faster in application-specific hardware designed or programmed to compute the operation than specified in software and performed on a general-purpose computer processor. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. The implementation of computing tasks in hardware to decrease latency and increase throughput is known as hardware acceleration.\n\nTypical advantages of software include more rapid development (leading to faster times to market), lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of hardware include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification and times to market. In the hierarchy of digital computing systems ranging from general-purpose processors to fully customized hardware, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with efficiency increasing by orders of magnitude when any given application is implemented higher up that hierarchy. This hierarchy includes general-purpose processors such as CPUs, more specialized processors such as GPUs, fixed-function implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and fixed-function implemented on application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs). \n\nHardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, and practical when the functions are fixed so updates are not as needed as in software solutions. With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow. \n\nIntegrated circuits can be created to perform arbitrary operations on analog and digital signals. Most often in computing, signals are digital and can be interpreted as binary number data. Computer hardware and software operate on information in binary representation to perform computing; this is accomplished by calculating boolean functions on the bits of input and outputting the result to some output device downstream for storage or further processing.\n\nEither software or hardware can compute any computable function. Custom hardware offers higher performance per watt for the same functions that can be specified in software. Hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog and VHDL can model the same semantics as software and synthesize the design into a netlist that can be programmed to an FPGA or composed into logic gates of an application-specific integrated circuit.\n\nThe vast majority of software-based computing occurs on machines implementing the von Neumann architecture, collectively known as stored-program computers. Computer programs are stored as data and executed by processors, typically one or more CPU cores. Such processors must fetch and decode instructions as well as data operands from memory as part of the instruction cycle to execute the instructions constituting the software program. Relying on a common cache for code and data leads to the von Neumann bottleneck, a fundamental limitation on the throughput of software on processors implementing the von Neumann architecture. Even in the modified Harvard architecture, where instructions and data have separate caches in the memory hierarchy, there is overhead to decoding instruction opcodes and multiplexing available execution units on a microprocessor or microcontroller, leading to low circuit utilization. Intel's hyper-threading technology provides simultaneous multithreading by exploiting under-utilization of available processor functional units and instruction level parallelism between different hardware threads.\n\nHardware execution units do not in general rely on the von Neumann or modified Harvard architectures and do not need to perform the instruction fetch and decode steps of an instruction cycle and incur those stages' overhead. If needed calculations are specified in a register transfer level (RTL) hardware design, the time and circuit area costs that would be incurred by instruction fetch and decoding stages can be reclaimed and put to other uses. \n\nThis reclamation saves time, power and circuit area in computation. The reclaimed resources can be used for increased parallel computation, other functions, communication or memory, as well as increased input/output capabilities. This comes at the opportunity cost of less general-purpose utility.\n\nGreater RTL customization of hardware designs allows emerging architectures such as in-memory computing, transport triggered architectures (TTA) and networks-on-chip (NoC) to further benefit from increased locality of data to execution context, thereby reducing computing and communication latency between modules and functional units. \n\nCustom hardware is limited in parallel processing capability only by the area and logic blocks available on the integrated circuit die. Therefore, hardware is much more free to offer massive parallelism than software on general-purpose processors, offering a possibility of implementing the parallel random-access machine (PRAM) model.\n\nIt is common to build multicore and manycore processing units out of microprocessor IP core schematics on a single FPGA or ASIC. Similarly, specialized functional units can be composed in parallel as in digital signal processing without being embedded in a processor IP core. Therefore, hardware acceleration is often employed for repetitive, fixed tasks involving little conditional branching, especially on large amounts of data. This is how Nvidia's CUDA line of GPUs are implemented.\n\nAs device mobility has increased, the relative performance of specific acceleration protocols has required new metricizations, considering the characteristics such as physical hardware dimensions, power consumption and operations throughput. These can be summarized into three categories: task efficiency, implementation efficiency, and flexibility. Appropriate metrics consider the area of the hardware along with both the corresponding operations throughput and energy consumed.\n\nSuppose we wish to compute the sum of formula_1 integers. Assuming large integers are available as codice_1 large enough to hold the sum, this can be done in software by specifying (here, in C++):\n\nconstexpr int N = 20;\nconstexpr int two_to_the_N = 1 « N;\n\nbignum array_sum(const std::array<int, two_to_the_N>& ints) {\n\nThis algorithm runs in linear time, formula_2 in Big O notation. In hardware, with sufficient area on chip, calculation can be parallelized to take only 20 time steps using the prefix sum algorithm. The algorithm requires only logarithmic time, formula_3, and formula_4 space as an in-place algorithm:\n\nparameter int N = 20;\nparameter int two_to_the_N = 1 « N;\n\nfunction int array_sum;\nendfunction\nThis example takes advantage of the greater parallel resources available in application-specific hardware than most software and general-purpose computing paradigms and architectures.\n\nHardware acceleration can be applied to stream processing.\n\nExamples of hardware acceleration include bit blit acceleration functionality in graphics processing units (GPUs), use of memristors for accelerating neural networks and regular expression hardware acceleration for spam control in the server industry, intended to prevent regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The hardware that performs the acceleration may be part of a general-purpose CPU, or a separate unit. In the second case, it is referred to as a hardware accelerator, or often more specifically as a 3D accelerator, cryptographic accelerator, etc.\n\nTraditionally, processors were sequential (instructions are executed one by one), and were designed to run general purpose algorithms controlled by instruction fetch (for example moving temporary results to and from a register file). Hardware accelerators improve the execution of a specific algorithm by allowing greater concurrency, having specific datapaths for their temporary variables, and reducing the overhead of instruction control in the fetch-decode-execute cycle.\n\nModern processors are multi-core and often feature parallel \"single-instruction; multiple data\" (SIMD) units. Even so, hardware acceleration still yields benefits. Hardware acceleration is suitable for any computation-intensive algorithm which is executed frequently in a task or program. Depending upon the granularity, hardware acceleration can vary from a small functional unit, to a large functional block (like motion estimation in MPEG-2).\n\n"}

Located to the northwest of Sheffield Cathedral, the square is set on a slope and was formerly used for public meetings.\n\nParadise Square was built in the 18th century on the site of \"Hicks' stile-field\", the stile being one of the entrances to the church-yard. The reason for the choice of the name \"Paradise Square\" is uncertain, but local historians R. E. Leader and S. O. Addy speculated that it may be an allusion to the ancient use of \"Paradise\" or \"Parvis\" as the name for a garden or enclosed space near a church. The area acquired the nickname \"Pot Square\" when crockery vendors were moved here from the High Street in around 1808.\n\nThe east side of the square consists of five houses built in 1736 by Nicholas Broadbent on land leased from the trustees of the Shrewsbury Hospital. The other houses in the square were built by his son Thomas Broadbent, from 1771 to c.1790. Number 11 is dated 1787. Following bomb damage in the Second World War, parts of the square were extensively restored between 1963-6 by Hadfield, Cawkwell, Davidson and Partners, when numbers 18 and 26 were largely rebuilt using materials that were salvaged from buildings elsewhere. In the mid-1980s, an early 19th-century Gothic revival stuccoed building at number 10 was rebuilt with a Neo-Georgian facade. All buildings in the square are Grade II* listed.\n\nDescribing Paradise Square, J. E. Manning, Minister of Upper Chapel, wrote in 1900 \"Paradise Square was not then [in 1831] so quiet as it ordinarily is now. It was often thronged with excited crowds who came to hear what their leaders had to say on all the stirring topics of the time.\" Number 18 was built with a Masonic Hall on the upper floor. This was accessed from the square \"via\" a staircase with a balcony at the top that became the rostrum for speakers at public meetings.\n\nThe first recorded assembly in Paradise Square was on 15 July 1779 when John Wesley preached to what he would later note in his journal was \"\"the largest congregation I ever saw on a weekday\"\". The Methodist Conference commissioned a memorial to be placed in the square commemorating this event. This was designed by Alfred Tory, and unveiled in 1951 by J. Arthur Rank. John Wesley was not the only preacher to use the Paradise Square, Rowland Hill preached in the square on 26 September 1798.\n\nParadise Square was also used by the chartists in Sheffield for a number of meetings, notably on 12 September 1839 when the crowd was dispersed by troops leading to a running battle and a number of arrests. Throughout the 19th century it was traditional that those standing for election to represent the Sheffield constituency in Parliament held political meetings in the square. The balcony at number 18 was removed in 1889, effectively ending the use of the square as a meeting place.\n\nThough the pottery market in the square was not long-lived, a number of the buildings in the square were used by glass and china dealers throughout the 19th century. Early residents of square were mostly from the Upper Middle classes, such as attorneys and physicians. Notable former residents include sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey, who had a studio here at No. 24 in 1802, and physician David Daniel Davis, who lived at No. 12 from 1803 to 1812. Through the 19th century there were a number of public houses in the square, including the \"Old Cock tavern\" at number 11 and \"Q in the corner inn\" at number 17. In recent years the buildings have been used as offices, though in 2008 numbers 7 and 9 were converted into a restaurant.\n\nWhen funding becomes available, the square will be converted to an urban park as part of the Grey to Green Scheme set up by Sheffield City Council.\n\nSheffield Outrages\n\n"}

{"id": "2031076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031076", "title": "Sophie Taeuber-Arp", "text": "Sophie Taeuber-Arp\n\nSophie Henriette Gertrud Taeuber-Arp (; 19 January 1889 – 13 January 1943) was a Swiss artist, painter, sculptor, textile designer, furniture and interior designer, architect and dancer. She is considered one of the most important artists of concrete art and geometric abstraction of the 20th century.\n\nBorn in Davos, Switzerland, Sophie Henriette Gertrud Taeuber was the fifth child of Prussian pharmacist Emil Taeuber and Swiss Sophie Taeuber-Krüsi, from Gais in Appenzell Inner Rhodes, Switzerland. Her parents operated a pharmacy in Davos until her father died of tuberculosis when she was two years old, after which the family moved to Trogen, where her mother opened a pension. She studied textile design at the trade school (\"Gewerbeschule\", today \"School of Applied Arts\") in St. Gallen (1906–1910). She then moved on to the workshop of Wilhelm von Debschitz at his school in Munich, where she studied in 1911 and again in 1913; in between, she studied for a year at the School of Arts and Crafts (Kunstgewerbeschule) in Hamburg. She joined the Schweizerischer Werkbund in 1915. In the same year, she attended the Laban School of Dance in Zurich, and in the summer she joined the artist colony of Monte Verita in Ascona; in 1917, she danced with Suzanne Perrottet, Mary Wigman and others at the Sun Festival organised by Laban in Ascona. From 1916 to 1929, Taeuber was an instructor at Zürich Kunstgewerbeschule in Switzerland, teaching embroidery and design classes.\n\nIn 1915, at an exhibition at the Tanner Gallery, she met the Dada artist Jean \"Hans\" Arp, who had moved to Zurich in 1915 to avoid being drafted by the German Army during the First World War. They were to collaborate on numerous joint projects until her death in 1943. They married in 1922 and she changed her last name to Taeuber-Arp.\n\nTaeuber-Arp taught weaving and other textile arts at the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich (now Zurich University of the Arts) from 1916 to 1929. Her textile and graphic works from around 1916 through the 1920s are among the earliest Constructivist works, along with those of Piet Mondrian and Kasimir Malevich. These sophisticated geometric abstractions reflect a subtle understanding of the interplay between colour and form.\n\nDuring this period, she was involved in the Zürich Dada movement, which centred on the Cabaret Voltaire. She took part in Dada-inspired performances as a dancer, choreographer, and puppeteer, and she designed puppets, costumes and sets for performances at the Cabaret Voltaire as well as for other Swiss and French theatres. At the opening of the Galerie Dada in 1917, she danced to poetry by Hugo Ball while wearing a shamanic mask by Marcel Janco. A year later, she was a co-signer of the Zurich Dada Manifesto. As both a dancer and painter, Taeuber was able to incorporate Dada in her movement for dancing and was described as obscure and awkward.\n\nShe also made a number of sculptural works, such as a set of abstract \"Dada Heads\" of turned polychromed wood. With their witty resemblance to the ubiquitous small stands used by hatmakers, they typified her elegant synthesis of the fine and applied arts.\n\nTaeuber-Arp was also close friends and contemporaries with the French-Romanian avant-garde poet, essayist, and artist, Tristan Tzara, one of the central figures of the Dada movement. In 1920, Tzara solicited over four dozen Dadaist artists, among which were Taeuber-Arp, Jean Arp, Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp, and Hannah Hoch. Tzara planned to use the contributed text and images to create an anthology of Dada work entitled \"Dadaglobe\". A worldwide release of 10,000 copies was planned, but the project was abandoned when its main backer, Francis Picabia, distanced himself from Tzara in 1921.\n\n\"The Guardian\" called her a \"radical artist who brought joy to the dada\". Though dada has been described as an early form of subversive pop culture likened by some to the punk subculture, critics have said that Taeuber's artworks were not angry but \"joyous abstractions\", created as part of a movement that has been called revolutionary for its influence challenging the established conventions of art by \"playing with blocks and blobs of colour, moving them around randomly, letting patterns emerge by chance, in a kind of visual jazz.\"\n\nIn 1926 Taeuber-Arp and Jean Arp moved to Strasbourg, where both took up French citizenship; after which they divided their time between Strasbourg and Paris. There Taeuber-Arp received numerous commissions for interior design projects; for example, she was commissioned to create a radically Constructivist interior for the Café de l'Aubette – a project on which Jean Arp and de Stijl artist Theo van Doesburg eventually joined her as collaborators. In 1927 she co-authored a book entitled \"Welly Lowell\" with Blanche Gauchet.\n\nFrom the late 1920s, she lived mainly in Paris and continued experimenting with design. The couple became French citizens in 1926 and in 1928 they moved to Meudon-Val Fleury, outside Paris, where she designed their new house and some of its furnishings. She was an exhibitor at the Salon des Surindépendents in Paris in 1929–30.\n\nIn the 1930s, she was a member of the group Cercle et Carré, founded by Michel Seuphor and Joaquín Torres García as a standard-bearer of non-figurative art, and its successor, the Abstraction-Création group (1931–34). Taeuber-Arp also provided the cover art for the February 1933 issue of Eugene Jolas's avant-garde little magazine, \"transition\".\n\nSophie Taeuber-Arp explored the circle which represented the cosmic metaphor, the form that contains all others. She referred to this period as “ping pictures”.  \n\nShe appears to be the first artist to use polka dots in fine art with works such as \"Dynamic Circles\", 1934, in the footsteps of Kazimir Malevich and his Black Circle (1915).\n\nLater in the decade she founded a Constructivist review, \"Plastique\" (Plastic) in Paris. Her circle of friends included the artists Sonia Delaunay, Robert Delaunay, Wassily Kandinsky, Joan Miró, and Marcel Duchamp. She was also a member of Allianz, a union of Swiss painters, from 1937 to 1943. In 1940, Taeuber-Arp and Arp fled Paris ahead of the Nazi occupation and moved to Grasse in Vichy France, where they created an art colony with Sonia Delaunay, Alberto Magnelli, and other artists. At the end of 1942, they fled to Switzerland.\n\nIn early 1943, Taeuber-Arp died of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning caused by an incorrectly operated stove at the house of Max Bill.\n\nWassily Kandinsky said: \"Sophie Taeuber-Arp expressed herself by means of the 'colored relief,' especially in the last years of her life, using almost exclusively the simplest forms, geometric forms. The forms, by their sobriety, their silence, their way of being sufficient unto themselves, invite the hand, if it is skillful, to use the language that is suitable to it and which is often only a whisper; but often too the whisper is more expressive, more convincing, more persuasive, than the 'loud voice' that here and there lets itself burst out.\"\n\nIn 2014, at the \"Danser sa vie\" dance and art exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in France, a photograph was displayed of Taeuber-Arp dancing in a highly stylized mask and costume at the Cabaret Voltaire in 1917.\n\nTaeuber-Arp was the only woman on the eighth series of Swiss banknotes; her portrait was on the 50-franc note from 1995 to 2016 \n\nA museum honouring Taeuber-Arp and Jean Arp opened in 2007 in a section of the Rolandseck railway station in Germany, re-designed by Richard Meier. The video work \"Sophie Taeuber-Arp's Vanishing Lines\" (2015) by new media artist Myriam Thyes from Switzerland is about her \"Lignes\" drawings, segmented circles intersected by lines.\n\nOn 19 January 2016, Google created a Google Doodle for Sophie to commemorate her 127th birthday. The doodle was made by Mark Holmes, who describes Taeuber-Arp as \"such a prolific and diverse artist.\"\n\nTaeuber-Arp took part in numerous exhibitions. For example, she was included in the first Carré exhibition at the Galeries 23 (Paris) in 1930, along with other notable early 20th-century modernists. In 1943, Taeuber-Arp was included in Peggy Guggenheim's show \"Exhibition by 31 Women\" at the Art of This Century gallery in New York. Many museums around the world have her work in their collections, but in the public consciousness her reputation lagged for many years behind that of her more famous husband. Sophie Taeuber-Arp began to gain substantial recognition only after the Second World War, and her work is now generally accepted as in the first rank of classical modernism. An important milestone was the exhibition of her work at documenta 1 in 1955.\n\nIn 1970, an exhibit of Taeuber-Arp's work was shown at the Albert Loeb Gallery in New York City.\n\nThen, in 1981 the Museum of Modern Art (New York) mounted a retrospective of her work that subsequently travelled to the Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), the Museum of Fine Arts (Houston), Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal.\n\nAmerican scholar Adrian Sudhalter organized an exhibition called \"Dadaglobe Reconstructed\" that sought to honor the centennial of Dada's inception, along with Tzara's ambitious project. Compiling over 100 works of art that were initially slated to appear in Tristan Tzara's \"Dadaglobe\" anthology, among which are works by Taeuber-Arp, the show ran from 5 February to 1 May 2016 at the Kunsthaus Zurich, and from 12 June to 18 September 2016 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nhttps://www.wikiart.org/es/sophie-taeuber-arp\n"}

The first tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual hurricane season, Alberto developed from a tropical wave over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 30. Initially a tropical depression, the system moved westward, before curving northwestward on July 1 and entering the Gulf of Mexico. Early on the following day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto. Alberto strengthened steadily over the Gulf of Mexico, and by midday on July 3, it peaked as a strong tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). A few hours later, the cyclone made landfall near Destin, Florida, at the same intensity. The system quickly weakened to a tropical depression early on July 4. Thereafter, a high pressure system caused Alberto to drift over west-central Georgia and central Alabama, until the storm dissipated over Alabama on July 7.\n\nIn its early and precursor stages, Alberto produced about of precipitation on Cuba's Isla de la Juventud. Striking the Florida Panhandle as a strong tropical storm, the cyclone caused some erosion and wind damage. Additionally, freshwater flooding forced about 3,000 people to flee their homes. Damage in Florida totaled about $80 million. The storm generated heavy precipitation over much of southeastern Alabama. Floodwaters entered hundreds of homes each in Coffee, Dale, Geneva, Henry, and Houston counties. Georgia experienced the worst effects from the storm. Up to of rain fell near Americus. Flooding resulted in the closure of approximately 1,000 bridges, while about of croplands were inundated in Georgia alone. Throughout Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, approximately 18,000 businesses and homes suffered damage or destruction. Alberto was responsible for $1.03 billion in damages (1994 USD) and 32 deaths.\n\nRadiosonde data from Dakar, Senegal, indicated that a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on June 18. The wave moved westward for several days, with an associated area of low clouds. Little deep convection developed until June 26, when the wave was situated in just north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. However, strong wind shear diminished a significant amount of convection while the system crossed the Bahamas on June 28. After crossing Cuba and emerging into the Caribbean Sea by the following day, deep convection quickly redeveloped and became more concentrated as the wave encountered only light vertical wind shear. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system on June 30 detected a well-defined circulation. As a result, Tropical Depression One developed just west of Isla de la Juventud at 06:00 UTC. Initially, the depression moved westward at about . However, a low aloft centered over the south-central Gulf of Mexico and a mid-latitude short-wave trough moving eastward across the northern gulf caused the depression to curve northwestward on July 1.\n\nEarly on July 2, a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone indicated that it had intensified into a tropical storm, which was assigned the name \"Alberto\". Later that day, Alberto accelerated somewhat in a northerly direction due to another short-wave trough approaching the central Gulf Coast of the United States, with the storm's forward speed increasing to about . Although the system previously had a rather poor appearance on satellite imagery, the center of circulation became more embedded within the deep convection. At 12:00 UTC on July 3, Alberto attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . About three hours later, the cyclone made landfall near Destin, Florida, at the same intensity. As the storm moved inland, satellite imagery detected hints of a developing eye feature. However, Alberto rapidly weakened, falling to tropical depression intensity by 00:00 UTC on July 4. After bypassing the short-wave trough, the cyclone's forward progress became blocked by a building high pressure area. As a result, Alberto began drifting over Georgia, executing a small cyclonic loop before entering Alabama. Although very weak, the depression remained a tropical cyclone until its circulation dissipated over Alabama late on July 7.\n\nOn June 30, on the day of Alberto's formation, a tropical storm warning was issued from Puerto Juárez to Mérida, Mexico; the warning was discontinued on July 1. In the United States, a tropical storm watch was posted on July 2 for locations between Sabine Pass, Texas and Pensacola, Florida. The watch was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm warning from Gulfport, Mississippi to Cedar Key, Florida; it was soon altered to a hurricane warning. Later on July 3, the hurricane warning was discontinued and replaced with a tropical storm warning, which was lifted at 2100 UTC.\n\nOn the Florida Panhandle, residents boarded up windows in anticipation of what was to be a \"fury\". At gasoline stations, unusually long lines formed, and local stores did increased business in selling emergency supplies. Thousands of tourists along the coast left the region; a local deputy was quoted as estimating that 10,000 people checked out of their hotels early. On Okaloosa Island and Holiday Isle, ground-floor house and businesses were forced to evacuate. Civil-defense authorities evacuated residents from low-lying locations. Then-Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, declared a State of emergency for parts of the state, and advised residents along the coast to monitor updates regarding the storm. Over 3,000 people sought refuge in Red Cross shelters along the coast of Florida, westward into parts of Alabama.\n\nUpon forming, the storm dropped heavy rainfall over parts of Cuba, peaking at .\n\nAt Destin, Florida, sustained winds blew at , while winds gusted to ; however, there was an unofficial report of gusts. There, barometric pressure fell to in association with Alberto. Storm tides of was estimated along the coast of Destin, while tides reached at Panama City. At St. George Island, wind gusts reached . Beach erosion and tidal flooding occurred along the coast. Throughout northwest Florida, of rain fell, with totals as high as . Other precipitation accumulations include at Caryville.\n\nAlong the coast, damage was limited to sea walls, piers and boats, and roof damage to some beachfront motels. As the storm progressed inland, it brought down signs, billboards, trees and powerlines, and triggered moderate flooding; about 18,500 customers lost electric power. As a weakened tropical depression, the remnants of Alberto dropped extensive rainfall throughout the region. As heavy rain fell to the north, tremendous volumes of water moved down major river systems into the Florida Panhandle. As a result, there was extensive river flooding that exceeded 100-year events in some locations, particularly along the Apalachicola and Chipola Rivers. The Apalachicola remained above flood stage until August, although in localized areas, flooding persisted until September due to Tropical Storm Beryl. A total of 300,000 chickens and 125 cattle and hogs were lost within the state, and offshore, 90% of the oysters in Apalachicola Bay were lost. The flooding was severe, inflicting $40 million (1994 USD) in damage to infrastructure, $14 million in insured damage, and $25 million in agricultural losses.\n\nIn Georgia, rainfall from the tropical cyclone peaked at 27.85 in (707 mm) near Americus. Due to a previously stalled cold front, which subsequently caused Alberto to remain stationary, the ground was already saturated with rainfall. Virtually all of the precipitation became instant runoff into streams and rivers. Peak discharges along the Flint and Ocmulgee rivers exceeded 100-year flood levels. At least 100 dams and recreational watersheds suffered severe damage or were destroyed. Many roads were inundated, forcing the closure of 175 roads and 1,000 bridges. Damage to highway infrastructure exceeded $130 million.\n\nApproximately of croplands were submerged, causing about $100 million in damage to agriculture. Fifteen of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) gaging stations were severely damaged or demolished, forcing data to be collected manually and reported by cellphone. Due to flooded water systems, approximately 500,000 people were temporarily left without drinking water. There were 31 deaths in the state, most of which from cars being swept onto flooded roads or into swollen creeks. With $750 million in damage, Alberto was considered the costliest tropical cyclone in Georgia, until Hurricane Michael in 2018. The flooding was considered the worst in the history of the state. \nAlong the state line with Florida, five counties in southwestern Georgia reported of precipitation. In Bainbridge, the rising Flint River caused 300 residents to evacuate. Although the river crested about lower than initially predicted, flooding moderately or severely damaged approximately 300 homes in Bainbridge, as well as more than a dozen businesses. A local fertilizer plant was also threatened by the swollen Flint River. In the five counties of Brooks, Colquitt, Cook, Thomas, and Worth, the Little and Ochlockonee rivers overflowed their banks, flooding adjacent areas. In Early and Miller counties, of rain fell between July 3 and July 7, while an additional of precipitation was observed from July 10 to July 14. Many low-lying areas were flooded. Seven families were evacuated from their homes in Safford due to flooding. Further north, the Flint River also overflow its banks in Baker and Mitchell counties. Extensive flooding occurred in Newton, with more than $100,000 in property damage. Widespread inundation of crops were reported in both counties.\n\nIn Dougherty County, the Flint River exceeded its banks, forcing over 20,000 residents to evacuate. Five deaths were reported in the county, with four people drowning in the river and another from a woman being trapped in her home for several days. The City of Albany was cut in half by the flooding, and hundreds of caskets were disinterred and floated away, sometimes disintegrating into the water.

The territory they lived on became a part of the first Polish state created by duke Mieszko I and expanded at the end of the 10th century, enlarged further by conquests of king Bolesław I at the beginning of the 11th century. \n\nIn about 850 AD a list of peoples was written down by the Bavarian Geographer. Absent on the list are Lechitic-speaking Polans, Pomeranians and Masovians, who became known later and were written about by Nestor the Chronicler in his \"Primary Chronicle\" (11th/12th century).\n\nThe most important tribes. who were conquered by Polans were the Masovians, Vistulans, Silesians and Pomeranians. These five tribes \"shared fundamentally common culture and language and were considerably more closely related to one another than were the Germanic tribes.\"\n\nThe name \"Poland\" is derived from the most powerful of the tribes — the Polans. Their name, in turn, derives from the word \"pole\" — field. It was also used for the eastern Polans, a perhaps unrelated East Slavic tribe that lived in the region of the Dnieper River in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Polish tribes were polytheistic pagans and worshiped a pantheon of numerous deities, each representing a different but equally important aspect of life for the Early Slavs - such as Perun, god of lightning. Little is known about what their religion was really like, but the limited archaeological evidence as well as remnants of pagan beliefs that have survived in the folklore of Slavic countries show many similarities between the faith of Polish tribes and that of other Early Medieval Slavic societies leading historians to believe that a common Slavic mythology exists between all Slavic branches.\n\nThe tribes were organized on the basis of kinship groups. A tribe's territory was divided into \"opoles\", which constituted a group of neighboring settlements. \n\nMost members of a particular tribe were yeoman peasants, although a small group of aristocrats (\"nobiles\" or \"potentiores\") was usually present.\n\nThe following is the list of Polish tribes that inhabited the lands of Poland in the early Middle Ages, at the beginning of the Polish state. They shared fundamentally common culture and language and together they formed what is now Polish ethnicity and the culture of Poland. This process is called ethnic consolidation in which several ethnic communities of kindred origin and cognate languages, merge into a single one.\n\nThe following Slavic tribes are considered as Polish:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2031138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031138", "title": "Albany Pine Bush", "text": "Albany Pine Bush\n\nThe Albany Pine Bush, referred to locally as the Pine Bush, is one of the largest of the 20 inland pine barrens in the world. It is centrally located in New York's Capital District within Albany and Schenectady counties, between the cities of Albany and Schenectady. The Albany Pine Bush was formed thousands of years ago, following the drainage of Glacial Lake Albany.\n\nThe Albany Pine Bush is the sole remaining undeveloped portion of a pine barrens that once covered over ,  and is \"one of the best remaining examples of an inland pine barrens ecosystem in the world.\" By 2008 it included all parcels of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve (a state nature preserve spanning ), the properties that connect these protected parcels, and some of the surrounding areas that abut the preserve. The Woodlawn Preserve and surrounding areas in Schenectady County are the western sections of the Pine Bush, separated geographically by other properties from the Albany Pine Bush Preserve in Albany County.\n\nHistorically regarded as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, the Pine Bush has come to be seen as a historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York. It is home to the Karner blue butterfly, an endangered species first identified by author Vladimir Nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from the Pine Bush. In 2014, Albany Pine Bush was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.\n\nAround 10,000 years ago Native Americans moved into the Pine Bush area. When Europeans arrived in the early 17th century, two groups lived in the immediate area: the Mohawk nation of the Iroquois to the west along the Mohawk River, and the Mahican to the east, along the Hudson River. The Dutch traded with both native groups from their outpost at Fort Orange (present-day Albany), which was established in 1624. For the natives the Pine Bush was an important source of firewood and animal pelts to trade with the Dutch. By 1640 the natives were having trouble finding enough animals in the Pine Bush to supply the growing European demand. The Mohawk referred to the settlement at Fort Orange as \"skahnéhtati,\" meaning \"beyond the pine plains,\" referring to the large area of the Pine Bush between the Hudson and Mohawk rivers.\n\nThe Dutch granted a patent in 1661 under the name of \"Schenectady\" to a settlement on a bend in the Mohawk River to the west of the Pine Bush and about 20 miles from Fort Orange. To the settlers at Fort Orange, the settlement on the Mohawk River started by Arent van Curler was \"beyond the pine plains\", and therefore the name Schenectady (in various spelling connotations) became associated with the village at that site. In 1664, the Dutch surrendered their entire colony of New Netherland, including Albany and Schenectady, to the English.\nWhat became known as the \"King's Highway\" were a series of footpaths which the Mohawk had long used to get from west in the valley through the Pine Bush to trade with other tribes at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers. This area was later the site of the Dutch Fort Orange. After the founding of Schenectady, the name was used for what became a major route between the two settlements but, until the mid-18th century, it was not improved beyond a footpath. During the war from 1699 to 1707, Albany residents collected firewood from the Pine Bush for the large army that was camped at Fort Frederick.\n\nIn 1710, Germans immigrated from Palatine to the Albany area. To pay off the cost of their passage some were sent to work camps in the Pine Bush to harvest pines for pitch and rosin for the construction of English naval vessels. Some of these immigrants named the Helderberg Escarpment and settled Schoharie County. Others, largely from work camps in Dutchess County along the Hudson River, settled further west in the valley in 1723, past Little Falls on the Burnetsfield Patent. (Most of the latter\n\nDuring the French and Indian Wars, the British military improved the road significantly for use by its forces. After the war it was used by numerous settlers moving west into the Mohawk Valley. During the late-18th century, taverns and the occasional homesteader began to dot the Pine Bush along the King's Highway, while development began to encroach on the Pine Bush at the Albany and Schenectady edges as those settlements began to grow. The highway and the Pine Bush was a frontier wilderness and extremely dangerous even after the end of the war. Starting in 1765, militiamen took turns escorting travelers through the area to protect them from outlaws, bandits, smugglers, and other dangers. During the American Revolutionary War, the Bush was home to Loyalists of the British Crown. Among the taverns established in the 1760s catering to Pine Bush travelers was the \"Truax Tavern\" owned by Isaac Truax, a descendant of French Huguenots and a Tory sympathizer; he said that he was \"not a Tory, but a man for the King\". Rumors circulated of several murders/robberies being carried out at the tavern.\n\nTravel became easier in 1793 following the revolution, when a stage coach began carrying passengers between the two cities and through the Pine Bush for three cents per mile.\n\nThe 19th century saw great improvements in modes of transportation for traveling through the Pine Bush with better roads and soon thereafter railroads. Beginning in 1799 the Great Western Turnpike (today's US Route 20) and the Albany-Schenectady Turnpike (New York Route 5) were built through the Pine Bush. The Western Turnpike connected Albany west across the state to the American Midwest, while the Albany-Schenectady Turnpike replaced the King's Highway to Schenectady. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad was chartered in 1826 in order to reduce travel time between Schenectady and Albany via the Erie Canal; it was the first railroad in the state of New York, and the fourth in the United States. On July 2, 1830, the DeWitt Clinton pulled the first passenger train in the United States, traveling over the route through the heart of the Pine Bush.\n\nOver time, the turnpikes and railroad opened up parts of the Pine Bush to settlement, farming, and land speculation. One of the earliest residents was Theophillus Roessle, who owned a large farm and manor in what is now the hamlet of Roessleville, just outside Albany in the town of Colonie. He claimed that the sandy soil of the Pine Bush was \"the best land for fruits in the world.\" Further west, part of the Pine Bush was carved up in 1858 into 860 plots as part of what is now known as the \"Great Land Swindle\" and sold to buyers outside the region. When they came to inspect their land, they thought the barrens were useless for agriculture; they tried to recoup their money by selling the land to other unsuspecting outsiders.\n\nAs in the colonial period, the Pine Bush continued to be tapped for its natural resources, with water becoming a target for development. The Patroon Creek, roughly where three feeder streams joined in the heart of the Pine Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake waterworks.\n\nIn 1871, the northwestern portion of Albany west of Magazine Street, consisting of mostly undeveloped Pine Bush, was annexed to the neighboring Town of Guilderland after the Town of Watervliet refused it.\n\nPortions of this territory were ceded to Albany in 1910 established its current border. A telling perspective of how it was viewed at the time is contained in the enabling law (Chapter 375 of the Laws of New York, 1910), which described the Pine Bush as \"being a territory lying to the west of the present boundary line of the city and which is in large part waste and unoccupied land, the ownership of which is uncertain.\" This law authorized Albany to lay out the newly annexed territory into lots and acquire land for a park system to connect the Rensselaer Lake waterworks property to the old city border.\n\nAs part of the Great Migration of African Americans out of the rural South to industrial cities in the early 20th century, the Reverend Louis W. Parson and his wife migrated in 1927 from Mississippi to Albany, where he founded the First Church of God in Christ. In four trips to Mississippi, Parson encouraged friends and family to move to Albany and join the church, which many did during the 1930s and 1940s. The reverend felt that the mores of Albany's South End, where they originally settled, was not conducive to religious life. He started a community in the Pine Bush along Rapp Road, purchasing two undeveloped properties in 1930 and 1933. It is a rare example of a chain migration community surviving from the Great Migration. This narrow entity is today designated as the Rapp Road Community Historic District, listed on both the state and the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1912, the city of Albany commissioned a study by notable architect Arnold W. Brunner and landscape architect Charles Downing Lay for beautification of the city; it was published as \"Studies for Albany\". Brunner and Lay proposed using the Rensselaer Lake waterworks property as the core of a new natural park, preferably leaving much of the grounds in their natural state; \"[i]n fact the less done to it the better.\" The city never acquired more land for a park here, and portions of the original waterworks property were sold off piecemeal and developed over the following century.\n\nIn the 1950s, the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) was built through the Pine Bush, disrupting habitat and ecology. Further development took place in the 1950s and 60s with the construction of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus and the SUNY Albany uptown campus. In the 21st century, the remaining Pine Bush represents only about 10% of the undeveloped land that existed prior to 1950.\n\nIn the 1960s, longtime Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd pushed forward the Washington Avenue Extension, a four-lane divided highway extending Washington Avenue westward from Fuller Road through the Pine Bush to New Karner Road (NY Route 155). This opened the heart of the Pine Bush and the western section of the city to development and has been described as \"a knife through the heart of the Pine Bush\". Soon afterward, Neil Hellman, a race horse magnate and major developer in the city, proposed a huge \"city within a city\" on that would have apartments, stores, an office park, one or two schools, and fire and police stations. Mayor Corning estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 persons would live there. Environmentalists and neighborhood groups fought and ultimately defeated this proposal.\n\nMayor Corning gave archaeologist Don Rittner a $500 donation in 1972 to excavate the Truax Tavern along the King's Highway. Rittner disproved the prevailing historical beliefs concerning the sophistication and structure of the tavern. He discovered several skeletons under the tavern's floor, which may confirm rumors of murders having taken place at the tavern. As a result of this project, Rittner was appointed as Albany's first municipal archaeologist, possibly the first of such a position in the nation.\n\nWhile Mayor Corning supported the largest purchases of Pine Bush land as a city preserve, he also approved placing the Albany landfill in the Pine Bush, the construction of the Washington Avenue Extension, and authorizing much of the development that occurred during his 42 years in office as mayor. These all had adverse environmental effects on the Bush. In 1967, a portion of Albany's waterworks/Pine Bush property in the town of Colonie along Central Avenue was sold to developers who built the Northway Mall. Two years later the city moved its dump to the Pine Bush. The Dunes, a single-family housing development in the middle of the Pine Bush off the Washington Avenue Extension, was built in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn response to these developments, concerned citizens worried about the future of the habitat formed Save the Pine Bush in 1978. The organization filed lawsuits for the next several decades to stop further developments in the barrens.\nThe activist group opposed construction of Crossgates Mall in the town of Guilderland. First proposed in 1978, it was finished in 1984, then expanded to doubled to 1.5 million square feet in 1994, becoming the third-largest mall in New York. Widespread regional opposition rose against plans in the late 1990s to more than double the mall againwith more than 2 million additional square feet of retail space, plus a 12-story hotel, and activities such as bowling, ice skating, miniature golf and soccer; the project was finally dropped in 1999.\n\nIn 1985, a bill to establish a state-controlled preserve to protect Pine Bush lands never made it out of committee. The bill was proposed the following year by Assemblyman Robert Connor (D)-New City. Among the local politicians who opposed the bill was Albany Mayor Thomas Whalen III, who sparred with Assemblyman Connors in a series of letters. Connors stated, \"if the mayor allows the final destruction of the Pine Bush, the city of Albany will be an ancient archaeological ruin before the pine barren is replaced.\" Assemblyman Arnold Proskin (R)-Colonie, whose district included portions of the proposed preserve, opposed on the grounds that the bill was creating another state agency (like the Adirondack Park Agency) that would wrest control from local communities over their development.\n\nThe legislature established the Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission in 1988. Its members consist of representatives of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, The Nature Conservancy, the towns of Colonie and Guilderland, and the city of Albany, Albany County; and four private citizens appointed by the governor. In 2001, the State Employees Federal Credit Union (SEFCU) bank branch on New Karner Road was taken under eminent domain by the state to be adapted for use as the Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center.\n\nLocated since 1969 in the Pine Bush, the Albany landfill has been expanded several times, the latest by in 2010. , the landfill is expected to have seven years of operating life remaining. Fees paid by other jurisdictions and businesses enable the landfill to generate $4–5 million annually to the Albany budget; city residents are provided with free trash collection. The city committed to spending $18 million to restore Pine Bush habitat in exchange for gaining approval of the 2010 expansion.\n\nIn 1969, when Albany opened its landfill, the city of Schenectady set aside its only patch of Pine Bush as the Woodlawn Preserve, designating the as a forever wild preserve. Since then, numerous developers have approached the city with proposals for development. In 2009 Schenectady County acted to protect as parkland in the neighboring town of Niskayuna; this is part of the Woodlawn Pine Barrens–Wetlands Complex which borders the Woodlawn Preserve. The county deeded this property to the town. This action complemented larger plans to connect the complex to the larger Pine Bush Preserve in Albany County\n\nThe Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center is a nature center in Albany, New York with exhibits and activities about the Albany Pine Bush Preserve's natural history, geologic and cultural significance. The center offers public programs such as teaching programs for school groups, guided hikes, lectures and after school programs, all of which are led by Pine Bush staff. Additionally, Pine Bush Discovery Center staff lead events like invasive species removal programs to allow community members to participating in maintaining the Pine Bush. The Pine Bush Discovery Center also encourages citizen science by running programs such as ant collection, where participants can collect and identify ants, providing data for Pine Bush staff to monitor their conservation efforts. It occupies a former SEFCU credit union bank branch on New Karner Road.\n\nThe Pine Bush is within the Hudson Valley section of the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province in the state of New York, and occupies parts of the city of Albany and the towns of Colonie and Guilderland within Albany County, as well as parts of Schenectady County to the west . The Pine Bush includes not only pine barrens, but also grasslands of prairie grasses, northern and southern successional forests, and numerous ravines with some wetlands. The Pine Bush ranges in elevation from to above sea level.\n\nUnderlying the Albany Pine Bush is a bedrock consisting of shale and siltstone, laid down 450 million years ago during the Middle Ordovician. The bedrock is covered by glaciolacustrine deposits which make up the sandy topsoils of the barrens.\n\nAs the glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake known today as Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from the weight of the glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America. \n\nLess than half of the protected areas of the Albany Pine Bush (42%, or ) are currently pitch pine-scrub oak barrens, with an additional of disturbed areas with invasive plant growth. As this area is now under protection, it can be restored to the status of pine barrens, especially with the use of controlled burning. The remaining pine barrens are dominated by pitch pine (\"Pinus rigida\"), a tall shrub layer consisting of bear oak and dwarf chestnut oak (\"Quercus ilicifolia\" and \"Quercus prinoides\"), and a low shrub layer composed of lowbush blueberries (\"Vaccinium angustifolium\" and \"Vaccinium pallidum\"), black huckleberry (\"Gaylussacia baccata\"), and sweet fern (\"Comptonia peregrina\"). Between areas of pitch pine-scrub oak barrens are small patches of grassland dominated by prairie grasses, including big bluestem (\"Andropogon gerardi\"), little bluestem (\"Schizachyrium scoparium\"), Indiangrass (\"Sorghastrum nutans\"), as well as small trees like the shrubby willows (\"Salix humilis\" and \"Salix tristis\"). Characteristic flowering plants include bush clover (\"Lespedeza capitata\"), goat's-rue (\"Tephrosia virginiana\"), and wild lupine (\"Lupinus perennis\").\n\nDue to prolonged periods of natural fire suppression, much of the Pine Bush has evolved into northern or southern hardwood forests. These forests, often dominated by invasive species, occupy roughly of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve. The southern hardwood forests are dominated by black locust (\"Robinia pseudoacacia\"), which is exotic, and black cherry (\"Prunus serotina\"); with lesser numbers of native oaks (\"Quercus\") and maples (\"Acer\"), and the exotic, invasive tree of heaven (\"Ailanthus altissima\"). The shrub layer is dominated by black raspberry (\"Rubus occidentalis\") and other brambles (\"Rubus\" sp.). In contrast the northern hardwood forests are dominated by aspen (\"Populus\"), black cherry, red maple (\"Acer rubrum\"), white pine (\"Pinus strobus\"), gray birch (\"Betula populifolia\"), green ash (\"Fraxinus pennsylvanica\"), and oaks.\nRavines within the Pine Bush contain mixed forests of pine-northern hardwoods and Appalachian oak-pine. The pine-hardwood forests are dominated by species such as white pine and yellow birch (\"Betula alleghaniensis\"), mixed with scattered red maple, a shrub layer dominated by witch-hazel (\"Hamamelis virginiana\"), and a herbaceous layer composed of a variety of herbs, mosses, and lichens. The Appalachian oak-pine forest has a tree canopy of one or more oak species, primarily black oak, white oak, and red oak (\"Quercus velutina\", \"Quercus alba\", and \"Quercus rubra\"); these are mixed with pitch pine and some white pine, and a shrub layer dominated by heath shrubs, typically blueberries and black huckleberry. Marshes and wetlands occur along the northern boundary of the Pine Bush and along the bottoms of ravines. Roughly of vernal pools have been mapped, these are ground-water fed ponds that are dominated by grasses, sedges, herbs, and low shrubs.\n\nThe Pine Bush is home to bog bluegrass (\"Poa paludigena\"), a federal species of concern, as well as the rare red-rooted flatsedge (\"Cyperus erythrorhizos\"), Houghton's umbrella-sedge (\"Cyperus houghtonii\"), and Schweinitz's flatsedge (\"Cyperus schweinitzii\"). Bog bluegrass occurs at the bottom of a ravine in the Pine Bush and is the only place in the New York Bight watershed where this plant appears. Bayard's malaxis (\"Malaxis bayardii\") is a rare orchid that occurs in the Pine Bush as well.\n\nThe Albany Pine Bush is home to hundreds of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (\"Plebejus melissa samuelis\"), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly is now on the Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (\"Atrytonopsis hianna\"), Henry's elfin (\"Incisalia henrici\"), frosted elfin (\"Incisalia irus\"), and Edward's hairstreak (\"Satyrium edwardsii\"). The inland barrens buck moth (\"Hemileuca maia\") is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (\"Catopyrrha coloraria\"), several noctuid moths (\"Apharetra purpurea\", \"Chaetaglaea cerata\", \"Chytonix sensilis\", \"Macrochilo bivittata\", and \"Zanclognatha martha\"), bird dropping moth (\"Cerma cora\"), and a geometrid moth (\"Itame\"). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.\n\nThe Pine Bush is also home to 30 of the 44 species of amphibians and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County. Seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York. Three species of salamander, the Jefferson salamander (\"Ambystoma jeffersonium\"), blue-spotted salamander (\"Ambystoma laterale\"), and spotted salamander (\"Ambystoma maculatum\"), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the spotted turtle (\"Clemmys guttata\") and wood turtle (\"Clemmys insculpta\"), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 \"New York State Breeding Bird Atlas\") and are fairly common species for the area. About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2031149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031149", "title": "Fine-needle aspiration", "text": "Fine-needle aspiration\n\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a diagnostic procedure used to investigate lumps or masses. In this technique, a thin (23–25 gauge (0.52 to 0.64 mm outer diameter)), hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells that, after being stained, are examined under a microscope (biopsy). The sampling and biopsy considered together are called fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) or fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) (the latter to emphasize that any aspiration biopsy involves cytopathology, not histopathology). Fine-needle aspiration biopsies are very safe minor surgical procedures. Often, a major surgical (excisional or open) biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration biopsy instead, eliminating the need for hospitalization. In 1981, the first fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the United States was done at Maimonides Medical Center. Today, this procedure is widely used in the diagnosis of cancer and inflammatory conditions.\n\nAspiration is safer and far less traumatic than an open biopsy; complications beyond bruising and soreness are rare. However, the few problematic cells can be \"too\" few (inconclusive) or missed entirely (a false negative).\n\nThis type of sampling is performed for one of two reasons:\n\nWhen the lump can be felt, the biopsy is usually performed by a cytopathologist or a surgeon. In this case, the procedure is usually short and simple. Otherwise, it may be performed by an interventional radiologist, a doctor with training in performing such biopsies under x-ray or ultrasound guidance. In this case, the procedure may require more extensive preparation and take more time to perform.\n\nAlso, fine-needle aspiration is the main method used for chorionic villus sampling, as well as for many types of body fluid sampling.\n\nIt is also used for ultrasound-guided aspiration of breast abscess, of breast cysts, and of seromas.\n\n\nBefore the procedure is started, vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, etc.) may be taken. Then, depending on the nature of the biopsy, an intravenous line may be placed. Very anxious patients can be sedated through this line, or oral medication (Valium) may be prescribed.\n\nThe skin above the area to be biopsied is swabbed with an antiseptic solution and draped with sterile surgical towels. The skin, underlying fat, and muscle may be numbed with a local anesthetic, although this is often not necessary with superficial masses. After locating the mass for biopsy, using x-rays or palpation, a special needle of very fine diameter is passed into the mass. The needle may be inserted and withdrawn several times. There are many reasons for this:\n\nAfter the needles are placed into the mass, cells are withdrawn by aspiration with a syringe and spread on a glass slide. The patient's vital signs are taken again, and the patient is removed to an observation area for three to five hours.\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, complications are possible, but major complications due to thin-needle aspiration biopsies are fairly uncommon, and when complications do occur, they are generally mild. The kind and severity of complications depend on the organs from which a biopsy is taken or the organs gone through to obtain cells.\n\nAfter the procedure, mild analgesics are used to control post-operative pain. Aspirin or aspirin substitutes should not be taken for 48 hours after the procedure (unless aspirin is prescribed for a cardiac or neurological condition). Since sterility is maintained throughout the procedure, infection is rare. But should an infection occur, it will be treated with antibiotics. Bleeding is the most common complication of this procedure. A slight bruise may also appear. If a lung or kidney biopsy has been performed, it is very common to see a small amount of blood in sputum or urine after the procedure. Only a small amount of bleeding should occur. During the observation period after the procedure, bleeding should decrease over time. If more bleeding occurs, this will be monitored until it subsides. Rarely, major surgery will be necessary to stop the bleeding.\n\nOther complications depend upon the body part on which the biopsy takes place:\n\nA study published in 2004 showed that in one case, a needle biopsy of a liver tumor resulted in the spread of the cancer along the path of the needle and concluded that needle aspiration was dangerous and unnecessary. The conclusions drawn from this paper were subsequently strongly criticized.\n\n\n\nLung\n\nNeck\n\nBone\n\nRisk\n"}

The book was criticized by Michael Scheuer, former CIA chief of the Bin Laden station, in his book \"Imperial Hubris\" for offering a platform for government leaks, which he deemed harmful to national security: \"After reading Mr. Woodward's \"Bush at War\", it seems to me that the U.S. officials who either approved or participated in passing the information—in documents and via interviews—that is the heart of Mr. Woodward's book, gave an untold measure of aid and comfort to the enemy.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2031181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031181", "title": "Johannes Baader", "text": "Johannes Baader\n\nJohannes Baader (June 21/22, 1875/76 – January 14/15, 1955), originally trained as an architect, was a German writer and artist associated with Dada in Berlin.\n\nBaader was born in Stuttgart, where his father worked as a metalworker at the royal buildings. Johannes' education began at the Stuttgart trade school from 1892 to 1895 and continued at the technical college. His first job was as a stonemason in Dresden cutting gravestones. In 1905 after moving to Berlin, he met Raoul Hausmann. Together they would become influential figures at the heart of Berlin Dada. In 1906 he designed a \"World Temple\", a utopian vision of interdenominational harmony. It took numerous forms as inspiration, including Greek and Indian archetypes. In common with many utopian architectural projects of the time, the building—which was to be 1500m high—remained unbuilt and exists only in the form of sketches and writings. 1911–12 saw him produce designs for an unbuilt zoo for Carl Hagenbeck.\n\nIn 1914, Baader's written output began to increase. He published a treatise, \"Vierzehn Briefe Christi\" (Fourteen Letters of Christ) concerning Monism and over the course of the next few years wrote articles for the journals \"Die freie Straße\" (The Free Street) and \"Der Dada\". In 1917 in the midst of the First World War, he was certified legally insane as a result of manic depression. Now equipped with considerable license, he gave outrageous public performances parodying public and mythic identities and producing utopian designs of monumental, metaphysical, and messianic dimensions. In the same year he ran for office in the Reichstag in Saarbrücken. He would later become a leader in the German political party known as The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution. Raoul Hausmann appointed him head of a society called \"Christus GmbH\" (Christ Ltd), which he formally founded as a legal company in 1917. Hausmann explained that the plan was to recruit persons to join the society for 50 marks, after which the member could too become Christ and would be unfit for military service and free from all temporal authority. Attempts were made to equate conscientious objection with Christian martyrdom. He became the centre of a scandal on November 17, 1918, after giving a performance in Berlin Cathedral entitled \"Christus ist euch Wurst\" (“Christ is to you sausage”) which disrupted the sermon of former Court Chaplain Dryander. From the choir loft above Baader is reported to have shouted either “You are the ones who mock Christ, you don’t give a damn about him” or “To hell with Christ!” This mocking of the clergy, laity and politicians and resulted in his brief arrest. In 1918, he declared he had been resurrected as the \"Oberdada\", the president of the universe, really a Dadaist parody of a high-ranking military figure. He wrote \"Die acht Weltsätze\" (Eight World Theses), a quasi-religious tract in the same year.\n\nFurther explanations of his 'cosmic identity' were expounded in collages such as \"Dada Milchstrasse\" (Dada Milky Way, 1919) and written pieces. Raoul Hausmann, Baader's friend and collaborator, credits him with being the first to having created giant collage art, which he produced from life-size posters and used in his direct action campaigns, after which he destroyed them. Perhaps his most infamous direct action occurred at the inaugural ceremony for the first German republic, held in 1919 at the Weimar Theater. Baader threw down home-made flyers from the balcony onto the heads of the founding politicians. These flyers, the title of which in English would read “The Green Horse”, nominated himself as the new governmentʼs President. Hans Richter considered Baader to be the “crowbar” of the Berlin Dada Movement and the only member capable of carrying out their resistance movement with maximum publicity. Richter wrote of him: “For sheer lack of inhibition he put in the shade even the activities of Dadaists in Zurich, New York, Berlin, and Paris; and this is saying a great deal... He was the furtherest removed from normality (and therefore convention) of them all.”\n\nAttempts to initiate a Dada architecture resulted in his \"Das Grosse Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama: Deutschlands Grösse und Untergang oder Die phantastische Lebensgeschichte des Oberdada\" (The Great Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama: Germany's Greatness and Decline or The Fantastic Life of the Superdada), originally shown in 1920 at the Berlin \"Erste internationale Dada-Messe\" (First International Dada Fair). This unique artwork, part national history, part personal biography, now survives only through photographs and is considered, according to Helen Adkins, to be “definitely the first assemblage-environment in the history of art”. Hanna Bergius classifies this entirely new art form as démontage, given it deconstructive essence. Baader also produced sketches of visionary architecture, which, in common with those of Hausmann and Yefim Golïshev, sometimes invoked proto-Constructivist girderlike structures. In 1919 exactly a year after the abdication of the Kaiser, Baader printed calling cards proclaiming he was President of the Earth and Universe. He applied to teach at Gropius's Bauhaus with these qualifications. An unimpressed Gropius declined.\n\nBaader died in a home for the elderly in Adldorf at age 79.\n\n"}

(1969–1986)\n\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted just 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974. By that time, the trio of Best, Law and Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were defeated by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.\n\nDave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven matches under his direction. He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in 1983 and 1985. In 1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.\n\nWilf McGuinness, the reserve team coach, was promoted to take Matt Busby's place as manager. He had been associated with the club since joining them as a player in the mid 1950s but he quickly faltered in the footsteps of the great man, and was not helped by Busby's presence in the background. United were an ageing side in need of refreshment, a circumstance McGuinness was unfortunate to come across. The club coped well enough in his first season in charge, managing an improved finish of 8th place compared to 11th place in Busby's final season. However, the cracks showed the following season, as the team floundered near the bottom of the table, and a League Cup elimination at the hands of Aston Villa, who at the time were mid-table in the Third Division, led to McGuinness being demoted back to his old reserve team position, and he left the club altogether shortly afterwards.\n\nBusby returned to the manager's seat on a temporary basis and pulled the team well clear of relegation, eventually matching the previous year's 8th-place finish. Frank O'Farrell of Leicester City became the club's new manager in the 1971 close season, after unsuccessful approaches for Jock Stein of Celtic, Don Revie of Leeds United and Dave Sexton of Chelsea. Despite starting the 1971–72 season well and raising hope that O'Farrell would be a good successor to Busby, a run of seven defeats from 1 January meant they were to finish in eighth place for the third successive year – a dismal showing for a club who had appeared capable of winning the title for at least the first half of the season. However, the season did see the signing of 22-year-old Aberdeen defender Martin Buchan, who would play a key role in later successes for United.\n\nAt this time, George Best was becoming a problem, continually flouting the rules and getting into various disciplinary troubles. At the end of the 1971–72 season, one day short of his 26th birthday, he announced his retirement, only to turn back on his decision and announce his intention to play again within days.\n\nWhile Best's erratic behaviour didn't help, United continued to struggle, opening the 1972–73 season with a disastrous nine matches without a win. Following a 4–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on 28 October 1972, chairman Louis Edwards planned to sack O'Farrell and made an audacious move for former Manchester City manager Joe Mercer, but O'Farrell was away on a scouting mission on the day Edwards intended to sack him, and the 58-year-old Mercer (who was to retire from football within two years) turned the offer down anyway.\n\nUnited's form briefly improved after this, allowing O'Farrell a stay of execution, but a 5–0 thumping by relegation rivals Crystal Palace just before Christmas proved too much, and led to the manager's dismissal on 19 December. In a way it was the end of an era, with Bill Foulkes having retired, Bobby Charlton's testimonial having been held the previous day and George Best once again announcing his retirement on the same day. Charlton, now 35, would play his last match for the club at the end of that season.\n\nThree days later, Scotland manager Tommy Docherty was announced as United's new boss, and immediately began to rebuild the side with a series of signings, most notably Lou Macari. United recovered and finished that season in 18th place. However, there were concerns about just how long the squad, made up of the few remaining members of the Busby team and seasoned older players signed by O'Farrell and Docherty, could stay afloat in the first division. The emergence of Macari and new captain Martin Buchan (widely regarded as the one decent signing O'Farrell had managed while in charge of the club) gave some cause for optimism, but the following season would prove to be a major struggle.\n\nDenis Law left on a free transfer during the close season to sign for Manchester City, which sparked some protests among fans. Best came out of retirement once more to sign with the team for the 1973–74 season. United were again caught in a relegation battle and entered the penultimate match of the season needing to win two match and for Birmingham City to lose in order to stay in the First Division. Birmingham won their match and Denis Law, playing for City against United, sealed United's fate with the only goal of the match, although Birmingham's victory meant United would have been relegated regardless of their own result. Manchester United were relegated to the Second Division after 36 years away.\n\nBy the time the season was over, George Best had finally walked out of United for good, playing his last match on New Year's Day 1974, although he did not actually leave the club until the following season when he was given a free transfer and signed for Stockport County.\n\nAfter the relegation, Docherty culled most of what remained of Busby's squad, with goalkeeper Alex Stepney being the only member of the European Cup-winning team to remain in the first team for the start of the following season. The new-look Manchester United squad was built around youthful players such as Sammy McIlroy, who had come to impress during the final months of the ill-fated 1973–74 campaign. Also in the squad were new signings like centre-half Jim Holton, winger Gordon Hill and forward Stuart Pearson.\n\nDespite the relegation, attendances at Old Trafford swelled during the 1974–75 season and United responded well, winning the Second Division and returning to the top flight, where they topped the standings in the early stages of the 1975–76 season and there were high hopes that United could become only the third club to be champions of the top flight one season after being promoted. However, form slipped mid-season, however, and finished third. A good FA Cup run also ended in disappointment at Wembley with a 1–0 defeat by Southampton in the final.\n\nUnited performed erratically in the league in 1976–77, struggling for consistency with some injury problems to key players, and finishing the season in sixth place, but United reached the FA Cup final again, this time beating Liverpool 2–1 in the final. This result ended Liverpool's chances of completing the treble, something United themselves would achieve 22 years later.\n\nThe new-look Manchester United side contained impressive young players like Steve Coppell, Sammy McIlroy, Brian Greenhoff, Jimmy Greenhoff, Arthur Albiston and Stuart Pearson. Although goalkeeper Alex Stepney was still with United, Busby's final signing and United's former captain Willie Morgan had left in the summer of 1975 after a dispute with manager Tommy Docherty. United were now being captained by Martin Buchan.\n\nBut just over a month later, news broke of Tommy Docherty's love affair with Mary Brown, the wife of the team's physiotherapist Laurie Brown, when he announced he was leaving his wife to marry her. When Docherty refused to resign, the board dismissed him. While Docherty's affair had been disruptive to the club, it was not a legally valid reason to dismiss someone, and so the board stated that he had been dismissed for abusing his position in order to obtain tickets for the two cup finals, and selling them for a profit. Despite this, it was well known why Docherty had been sacked, and there were suggestions he would sue the club for wrongful dismissal. However, Docherty never did so.\n\nDocherty had been popular with the fans, and the new manager, Dave Sexton, needed success to dispel the unfavorable comparisons. Sexton's track record was impressive – he had won the FA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup with Chelsea and taken unfancied Queens Park Rangers to the brink of the league title. He had rejected United's first approach for him to become manager in 1971, and had been linked with the job as long ago as 1969 when Busby's retirement was first announced.\n\nWith the FA Cup win, United qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but were nearly expelled because of crowd trouble in Saint-Étienne.\n\nOnce more United made it to the FA Cup final in 1979, but narrowly lost to Arsenal in what was known as the \"five-minute final\" for the flurry of goals in the last minutes.\n\nOne of Sexton's most famous movements in the transfer market was the double signing of Joe Jordan and Gordon McQueen, who were both brought in from United's fierce rivals Leeds United, who had lost touch with the leading lights of the English game since Don Revie had left for the England manager's job in 1974. But, along with a Liverpool side going from strength to strength, United were now faced with a surprising new competitor for honours and the signature of star players in the shape of Nottingham Forest, managed by Brian Clough. The East Midlands club had returned to the First Division in 1977 and went on to win a league title, two European Cups and two League Cups over the next three seasons.\n\nThe 1979–80 season, before which United had paid a club record £750,000 to sign midfielder Ray Wilkins from Chelsea, saw \"the Reds\" narrowly miss out on league glory, finishing second to Liverpool. During that season, United fans were blamed for a collapse at Ayresome Park causing the death of two Middlesbrough supporters. Controversy also erupted over allegations that United had been making illegal payments to young players, an allegation which was made shortly before the sudden death of chairman Louis Edwards.\n\nAn injury crisis at the start of 1980–81 caused the team to slump to mid-table and suffer an early exit from the FA Cup, although at least Sexton managed to keep United clear of the threat of relegation. Desperate to stop the rot, Sexton brought in striker Garry Birtles for a club record £1.25 million, yet he was to prove an expensive failure who took 30 games to score his first goal. United won their final seven games of the season but still finished just eighth in the league.\n\nDespite achieving runners-up spot in the league and reaching an FA Cup final during his time at the club, Sexton knew that \"nearly\" just wasn't good enough for United fans, and he was sacked at the end of the 1980–81 season.\n\nUnited chairman Martin Edwards searched for a new manager in hope of finding someone who could bring the league title to United. The most likely candidate for the job was Lawrie McMenemy, whose Southampton had shocked United in the FA Cup final five years earlier and were now competing in the upper reaches of the First Division. Brian Clough, who had taken Nottingham Forest to promotion to the league title to two European Cup triumphs in four successive seasons, was also rumoured to be linked with the vacancy, but chairman Martin Edwards insisted that United would not be making an approach for Clough. Bobby Robson, whose Ipswich Town side had just won the UEFA Cup), was also named as a possible candidate, as was Ron Saunders, who had just guided Aston Villa to their first league title in 71 years. But in the end, it was Ron Atkinson who got the job.\n\nHe broke the British transfer record in October 1981 to sign England midfielder Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion for £1.5 million, and signed Robson's teammate Remi Moses for £500,000 at the same time. Norman Whiteside soon broke through the youth ranks and was a key first team player at age 17, while striker Frank Stapleton managed a steady supply of goals after his acquisition from Arsenal. Atkinson also retained a number of players from the Sexton era, namely midfielder Ray Wilkins. Long-serving players Martin Buchan and Lou Macari, who had been with United under Docherty and in the case of Buchan under O'Farrell, were still with the club when Atkinson arrived, although both had left by 1984.\n\nAtkinson's side produced an attractive form of football, losing only eight games and finishing 3rd in his first season. The title race, which had featured a few predictable contestants including Ipswich Town and Tottenham Hotspur as well as a few surprise contenders like Southampton and even Swansea City, went to a Liverpool side who were England's top footballing side of the time.\n\nSuccess followed as United won the 1983 FA Cup final 4–0 after a replay against Brighton & Hove Albion. United also managed another third-place finish in the league, where Liverpool were champions again, and runners-up spot went to a Watford side who made the headlines with some impressive performances in their first season in the top flight. United also reached the cup final of the League Cup for the first time, but lost 2–1 to Liverpool. Norman Whiteside scored for United in both cup finals that season – the first player in English football to do so.\n\nAlthough United beat Liverpool in the 1983 FA Charity Shield at the start of the following season, they crashed out of the FA Cup in a humbling defeat at the hands of Third Division AFC Bournemouth. They rallied however to defeat Barcelona in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and made it to the semi-finals before losing to Juventus. United fought a fierce title challenge with the likes of Liverpool, Southampton and Nottingham Forest before a late slump consigned them to fourth place. The summer of 1984 saw the sale of popular midfielder Ray Wilkins to Milan after five years at Old Trafford, but Atkinson used the outlay from the sale to bolster his midfield with the acquisition of Gordon Strachan from Aberdeen and Jesper Olsen from Ajax.\n\nWelsh striker Mark Hughes made his debut for United in October 1983 and became a regular player the following season, where he scored 24 goals and was chosen as the Young Footballer of the Year for 1984–85. His form was such that, despite only being 21, he helped restrict the first team chances of £500,000 signing Alan Brazil and even managed to force Norman Whiteside out of a regular place for a short time, although Whiteside was then switched to central midfield after an injury to Remi Moses.\n\nIn 1985, Manchester United beat that season's league champions Everton to win another FA Cup, despite having been beaten 5-0 by Everton earlier that season, but not without some drama as Kevin Moran became the first player, albeit controversially, to ever be sent off in an FA Cup final. Down to ten men, Norman Whiteside scored the only goal of the match in extra time to win the cup. The victory would have given United entry to the 1985–86 European Cup Winners' Cup, but Liverpool's involvement in the Heysel Stadium disaster resulted in a five-year ban from European football for English clubs. United finished fourth in the league that season.\n\nThe 1985–86 season started spectacularly for United, who won all of their first ten league matches (a club record start to a season) and were ten points clear at the top of the table as early as October. They were unbeaten from their first 15 matches and it seemed that nothing would stop United from winning their first league title since 1967. However, their form slumped dramatically in the new year, with an injury to Bryan Robson meaning he missed much of the season, and they could only finish in fourth place. The club had decided to sell Mark Hughes against his wishes, and he developed a drinking problem which seriously affected his form before signing for Barcelona in the close season for around £2 million. The mid-season arrival of new strikers Terry Gibson and Peter Davenport did little to halt United's decline. They had finished 12 points behind champions Liverpool and were also ten points adrift of runners-up Everton, whose top scorer Gary Lineker linked up with Hughes at Barcelona that summer, and eighth points behind a West Ham United side who had emerged as surprise title contenders thanks largely to 26 goals that season from Scottish striker Frank McAvennie.\n\nOver the 1986 close season, rumours began to circulate that Ron Atkinson would be sacked as Manchester United manager. There was talk that Alex Ferguson, manager of Scottish side Aberdeen, would replace Atkinson. Another name to be linked with the job was Terry Venables, the Barcelona manager who had rejected an offer to manage Arsenal that spring, but the 1986–87 season began with Atkinson still manager.\n\nThe following season began poorly with three successive defeats, including a 1–0 home defeat by newly promoted Charlton Athletic, who had last played top division football in the 1950s. Their first win came at the fifth attempt when they beat Southampton 5–1 at home, but the next few weeks saw them lose to Everton and more worryingly drop points against the likes of Watford and Coventry City, as well as missing two penalties at home to Chelsea which enabled the West Londoners to grab all three points. The final straw came on 4 November 1986, when United lost 4–1 at Southampton in a League Cup third round replay. On the morning of 6 November 1986, the club's board announced that Atkinson had been sacked as manager, and later that day, Alex Ferguson was named as his successor.\n\nFerguson had won a host of trophies north of the border to help break up the Old Firm dominance of Rangers and Celtic, who had dominated the Scottish game almost interrupted for some 90 years. But the task facing him at Old Trafford was enormous – he was inheriting a demoralised team fourth from bottom in the First Division, and had to build a side capable of winning trophies and most importantly the league title, for which the wait was now approaching its 20th year. He did indeed have some very talented players at his disposal, particularly captain Bryan Robson, attacking midfielder Norman Whiteside (with two FA Cup medals and close to 200 first team appearances to his name at age 21) and defender Paul McGrath, but new signings were clearly needed.\n\n"}

'Compensating variation' refers to the amount of additional money an agent would need to reach their initial utility after a change in prices, a change in product quality, or the introduction of new products. Compensating variation can be used to find the effect of a price change on an agent's net welfare. CV reflects new prices and the old utility level. It is often written using an expenditure function, e(p,u):\n\nwhere formula_4 is the wealth level, formula_5 and formula_6 are the old and new prices respectively, and formula_7 and formula_8 are the old and new utility levels respectively. The first equation can be interpreted as saying that, under the new price regime, the consumer would accept \"CV\" in exchange for allowing the change to occur.\n\nMore intuitively, the equation can be written using the value function, v(p,w):\n\none of the equivalent definitions of the \"CV\".\n\nNotice that in this second example the CV is computed from the point of view of the government, in this case the CV measures the tax (or if negative the subsidy) the government has to give to the consumer in order to let him reach his old utility with the new system of prices. The only practical change is that the sign of the CV is changed. This change of perspective often occurs in order to have the same sign of the Equivalent variation.\n\nCompensating variation is the metric behind Kaldor-Hicks efficiency; if the winners from a particular policy change can compensate the losers it is Kaldor-Hicks efficient, even if the compensation is not made.\n\nEquivalent variation (EV) is a closely related measure that uses old prices and the new utility level. It measures the amount of money a consumer would pay to avoid a price change, before it happens. When the good is neither a normal good nor an inferior good, or when there are no income effects for the good, then EV (Equivalent variation) = CV (Compensating Variation) = ΔCS (Change in Consumer Surplus)\n\n\n"}

He is rated as an ancestor of the Brunonids, a cadet branch of the Ottonians, though an affiliation is uncertain. Bruno was killed fighting against Norse warriors in the Battle of Luneburg Heath and is venerated as one of the Ebsdorf Martyrs.\n\nHe was the eldest son of the Saxon count Liudolf (died 866) and his wife, Oda of Billung. His father held large estates in Eastphalia along the Leine river, where in 852 he founded the Brunshausen monastery. Bruno succeeded his father and is mentioned as a count in 877.\n\nWhile Liudolf is described as \"dux orientalis Saxonum\", i.e. leader in East Saxony (Eastphalia), it is possible that Bruno, according to the \"Res gestae saxonicae\" by the medieval chronicler Widukind of Corvey, already was \"dux totius Saxonum\", duke (\"Herzog\") of all Saxony. The rise of his family in East Francia is documented by the fact that Bruno's sister Liutgard in 874 married the Carolingian prince Louis the Younger, second son of King Louis the German, whereafter he is called \"ducem et fratrem reinæ\", \"duke and the queen's brother\" in the \"Annales Fuldenses\". Nothing is known of Bruno's marriage and children.\n\nHe supported his brother-in-law Louis the Younger in the fights with his uncle, Emperor Charles the Bald. As Saxon commander-in-chief during the Viking invasions, he died, along with several other noblemen, in a battle against \"Norsemen\" warriors (probably a Danish contingent of the Great Heathen Army, defeated by King Alfred the Great) on Candlemas Day, 2 February 880. The mid-winter battle was a crushing defeat; Duke Bruno, the bishops of Minden and Hildesheim, as well as twelve Saxon counts and several other noblemen were killed. According to the chronicler Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg, Bruno died in a flooded river, which probably took place during the battle or a retreat. He was succeeded by his younger brother Otto the Illustrious, whose son Henry the Fowler became King of East Francia in 919.\n\nBruno is venerated as a saint and martyr in the Catholic Church, being honored with a feast day on 2 February under the name St. Bruno of Saxony. About 1160 his relics were translated by the Dannenberg counts to Ebstorf Abbey near Uelzen, which from the 14th century was defined as the place of the 880 battle and became a major pilgrimage site.\n\nAccording to tradition, Bruno is also the founder of Brunswick as well as the ancestor of the local count Brun I (a candidate in the royal election of 1002) and his Brunonid descendants. Consistent naming suggests a kinship, however, some mentions appear to refer to an earlier Saxon margrave called Brun the Younger, possibly Bruno's grandfather.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2031301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031301", "title": "Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke", "text": "Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke\n\nErnst Wilhelm Ritter von Brücke (6 July 1819 – 7 January 1892) was a German physician and physiologist. He is credited with contributions made in many facets of physiology.\n\nHe was born Ernst Wilhelm Brücke in Berlin. He graduated in medicine at the University of Berlin in 1842, and during the following year, he became a research assistant to Johannes Peter Müller. In 1845 he founded the \"Physikalische Gesellschaft\" (Physical Society) in Berlin, together with Emil Du Bois-Reymond, Hermann von Helmholtz and others, in the house of physicist Heinrich Gustav Magnus. Later on, this became known as the \"Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft\" (German Society of Physics). In 1846, Brücke was elected teacher of anatomy in the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, in Berlin. Following that, in 1848 he was appointed as professor of physiology at the University of Königsberg, replacing Karl Friedrich Burdach (1776–1847). In 1849 he acquired similar duties at the University of Vienna. In 1873, Emperor Franz Joseph I honored Brücke with a noble title— von Brücke— but he rarely used it.\n\nErnst Fleischl von Marxow (1846–1891), and Joseph Paneth (1857–1890), two colleagues of Freud, were assistants to Brücke in Vienna; however Brücke is most noted for his influence on Sigmund Freud, one of his other medical students. Freud began studying under Brücke in 1877, and continued doing so until 1883. He was tasked to examine the biology of nervous tissue, specifically comparing the brains of humans and other vertebrates to that of invertebrates. Freud would many times call Brücke the professor who shaped him the most. This influence led to the development of the science of psychodynamics. Brücke's teachings did not only influence Freud's work; parts of the noted psychologist's theory were pulled directly from his professor's principles, specifically the idea that all living things are dynamic and must bow to the laws of chemistry and physics.\n\nBrücke retired from the University of Vienna in September 1890 and began working on a book he had long planned to write: \"Beauty and the Flaws of the Human Stature\", which ended up being published as \"The Human Figure: Its Beauties and Defects\".\n\nBrücke is remembered for his research on the nature of cells, work dealing with the physiology of language, investigations on the effect of electricity on muscles and studies of albumin. He also made significant contributions in the fields of physics, plant physiology, microscopic anatomy and experimental physiology.\n\nDuring Brücke's lifetime, specialization was not popularized. Because of this, he had very diverse interests, and made assorted contributions to the scientific community. Early on in his career, Brücke was interested in optics, which led him to research the tapetum lucidum of the vertebrate eye and the action of the ciliary muscle. Following that, Brücke studied the eye's absorption of various light rays, the mystery of color sensation, and positive and negative afterimages. His work in the science of optics was instrumental towards Helmholtz's invention of the ophthalmoscope.\n\nFurther investigation of this related subject found Brücke examining the color changes in chameleons and cephalopods, then studying pigment cells, and observing how muscular contraction is influenced by the duration of a stimulus.\n\nBrücke also made contributions in a completely different discipline, phonetics, when he wrote one of his early works directed at teachers of the deaf: \"Grundzüge der Physiologie und Systematik der Sprachlaute für Linguisten und Taubstummenlehre\".\n\nIn addition to optics, cellular investigations, and phonetics, Brücke had a deep interest in philosophy and aesthetics, which was demonstrated by his authorship of semi-popular books, specifically a work on the physiology of color in applied art. Brücke's interest in color and the arts spread out from the scientific aspects of color into the industrial world as he laid down the principles of color combinations for the guidance of workers in fabrics. From this he took the short step from color to artistic form and to the declaration of the underlying principles of what makes art beautiful.\n\nBrücke was a positivist. During his time, it was not an organized school of thought, but more a general attitude toward man, nature, and methods of investigation. He and others who shared his beliefs wanted to bring the approach of the natural sciences in to the investigation of all human thought and action. Brücke delved deeply into his position on positivism in \"Lectures on Physiology\", a course that was published in 1876.\n\nWhile a medical student in Berlin along with his colleague Emil Du Bois-Reymond, Brücke condemned the ideas of pantheism, all nature mysticism, and all talk of occult divine forces manifesting themselves in the real world. These superstitions contrasted directly with their principles of positivism and their more materialistic views of the world. Later, the two researchers, along with Hermann von Helmholtz, turned their sights against the popular philosophic theory of the time: vitalism. Vitalism is the idea that living things are only different from inanimate objects because they contain a \"vital spark\", which some believed to be the soul. The three partners contested this theory, stating that only the common physical-chemical functions are involved in the life of an organism.\n\nThe alternate theory that the researchers did adhere to was one that became very popular in the coming years: naturalism. This theory fit perfectly with the beliefs of Brücke and his colleagues, as it stated that everything comes from natural properties and sources.\n\nJosef Hyrtl (1810–1894) was the head of the institute of anatomy at the University of Vienna, and a strong believer in the vitalist theory. He and Brücke initially got along well, and it was Hyrtl's influence that allowed Brücke to be a professor at the University. However, the longer they worked in close quarters, the less civil they became. A feud started that would last throughout their academic careers.\n\nHyrtl was an older traditionalist with regards to physiology. He was used to anatomy being the dominant method of medical teaching and training, and Brücke challenged this with his newer version of physiology, which was animal experimentation. Brücke built a wooden hut to house dogs for his experiments in a location near both his and Hyrtl's apartments. Hyrtl made complaints that the barking of the dogs was preventing him from sleeping, and this may have been true, however, his real reason for complaining was the fact that he disliked Brücke's methods of investigation into physiology.\n\nThe feud expanded into a disagreement about the function of the semicircular canals of the inner ear. Hyrtl believed that based on their shape, the canals were used for directional hearing, while Brücke, having previous experimental knowledge about animals, concluded that the semicircular canals of the inner ear were instead sensory organs for equilibrium. This feud was a part of a deeper disagreement having to do with the two different philosophical viewpoints— vitalism and naturalism— that Hyrtl and Brücke followed.\n\nIn the Nineteenth century, there was a debate about the inaccuracy in the way artists represented movement. This was spurred by the invention of chronophotography and the assumption that this new technology would be able to change the habits of human and animal locomotion from a more aesthetic and \"conventional\" (incorrect) locomotion to a more natural one.\n\nThe debate was expanded to the idea that artists should make their representations, such as paintings and sculptures, in a way that accurately reflects the mechanics of the organism they are imitating. For example: artists painting a horse should paint the horse as frozen in a moment of movement that accurately reflects how a real horse moves, instead of an aesthetic, incorrect position. Brücke disagreed with this idea. He believed that artists should not be forced to contain the aesthetic of their art within parameters of reality and mechanics, because the invention of chronophotography was an ineffective stimulus for changing the locomotion of humans and animals, as it would not prompt the automatic correction of apparent impractical postures and movements. To this end, Brücke believed that there had been a decline in art ever since the artist endeavored to mimic perfect reality instead of seeking out beauty in its multitude of appearances.\n\n\n"}

Most modern carrot cake recipes have a white cream cheese frosting.\nThe origins of carrot cake are disputed. Published in 1591, there is an English recipe for \"pudding in a Carret(sic) root\" that is essentially a stuffed carrot with meat, but it includes many elements common to the modern dessert: shortening, cream, eggs, raisins, sweetener (dates and sugar), spices (clove and mace), scraped carrot, and breadcrumbs (in place of flour). Many food historians believe carrot cake originated from such carrot puddings eaten by Europeans in the Middle Ages, when sugar and sweeteners were expensive and many people used carrots as a substitute for sugar. Variations of the carrot pudding evolved to include baking with a crust (as pumpkin pie), steamed with a sauce, or molded in pans (as plum pudding) with icing.\n\nIn volume two of \"L'art du cuisinier\" (1814), Antoine Beauvilliers, former chef to Louis XVI, included a recipe for a \"Gâteau de Carottes\", which was popular enough to be copied verbatim in competitors' cookbooks. In 1824, Beauvilliers had published in London an English version of his cookbook which includes a recipe for \"Carrot Cakes\" in a literal translation of his earlier recipe.\n\nAnother 19th-century recipe comes from the housekeeping school of Kaiseraugst (Canton of Aargau, Switzerland). According to the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland, it is one of the most popular cakes in Switzerland, especially for the birthdays of children.\n\nThe popularity of carrot cake was revived in the United Kingdom because of rationing during the Second World War.\n\n\n\n"}

Clients included Mike Tyson, who sued him, yet retained him as manager when the two settled the lawsuit four years later, in 1988. Cayton also acted as a film historian and producer to preserve boxing's legacy. During his career, Cayton founded or co-founded several companies, including Cayton Sports, Inc., Reel Sports., Inc., Radio and Television Packagers, Inc. and Cayton, Inc.\n\nBorn in New York City, Cayton graduated from the University of Maryland in 1937 with a degree in chemical engineering and founded advertising agency, Cayton Inc. in 1945. He became involved in boxing in 1948 when he created and produced the TV program titled \"Greatest Fights of the Century\" to promote Vaseline brand hair tonic. Television was then in its infancy, and Cayton felt that boxing was the sport that lent itself best to the tiny black and white screens of the time.\n\nTo create the program, and many others that followed, he licensed, then later acquired, rights to vintage boxing film footage, and for nearly fifty years amassed and restored a collection of thousands of films going back to 1897. These films featured such legendary boxers as Jim Corbett, Jack Johnson (with a soundtrack by Miles Davis), Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Wilfred Benítez, and Kid Gavilán. Cayton even acquired rights to the first boxing film ever made, a sparring session filmed by Thomas Edison in 1894. His effort in collecting, restoring, and maintaining these films, many of which were rapidly deteriorating, is credited for preserving modern boxing's heritage and history.\n\nIn 1960 Cayton was joined by boxing historian and film collector Jim Jacobs, forming The Big Fights, Inc. With the guidance of boxing manager and trainer Cus D'Amato, the pair also subsequently went into managing boxers, nurturing such fighters as Wilfred Benítez, Edwin Rosario, and \"Iron\" Mike Tyson to world titles. Following Jacobs's death in 1988, Cayton managed world champions Tommy Morrison, Vinny Pazienza, and championship contenders Jeremy Williams, Michael Grant, and Omar Sheika, among others.\n\nThe Big Fights also produced numerous boxing features including \"a.k.a. Cassius Clay\" and Academy Award-nominated films \"Jack Johnson\" and \"Legendary Champions\". One of Cayton's hires in the 1960s was a then-unknown Harry Chapin, who was assigned a film editor's position, and who worked on \"Legendary Champions\" as its writer and director. Cayton fired Chapin numerous times for missing work, or for coming in late due to his musical pursuits, only to re-hire Chapin each time because of his talent and his endearing personality.\n\nCayton sold his film and tape library to the Walt Disney Company in 1998, which shows many of the titles on its ESPN Classic network. Cayton was also hired as the boxing coordinator for ESPN2's \"Friday Night Fights\" show, which experienced a resurgence in ratings and the level of competition shown due to Cayton's influence.\n\nCayton's advertising agency remained active until well into the 1970s.\n\nIn 1957, working with director and writer, Fred Ladd, it began marketing Russian animated films from the 1940s and 50s, especially those of the famous Soyuzmultfilm studios (well-known titles included \"The Firebird\", \"The Frog Prince\", \"Beauty & the Beast\", \"The Space Explorers\", and \"Twelve Months\").

These films proved popular both as features and as TV episodes. Many additional cartoons and natural history films produced by Cayton were marketed under the names \"Cartoon Classics\", \"Animatoons\", and \"Jungle.\" Cayton is also credited with reviving professional pool on television in 1977, producing showcase events which included, among others, the legendary Minnesota Fats - Willie Mosconi title matches.\n\nBeginning in 1988, following the death of Jim Jacobs, Mike Tyson wanted to replace Cayton with Don King, twice suing Cayton to end their professional relationship. The matter was settled out-of-court. A decade later, Tyson also sued Don King, seeking $100 million in damages; they settled out-of-court for $14 million.\n\nCayton was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2005.\n"}

Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, Japan's leading naval architect, assisted by Lieutenant Commander Kikuo Fujimoto, developed an innovative design which strongly influenced the design of Japan's subsequent heavy cruisers, as well as destroyers.\n\nThe basic design premise of \"Yūbari\" was that the highest possible speed and weaponry be maintained with the greatest possible weight reduction. To save weight, the armor was integrated directly into the hull structure, forming the side walls and deck. \"Yūbari\" had of belt armor protecting the machinery spaces and gun magazines, and armor for the deck and bridge, giving the vessel far superior armor than the previous 5000-ton cruiser designs. The forecastle was given significant flare to improve seakeeping.\n\nPropulsion was similar to that of a destroyer, with eight oil-fired Kampon boilers feeding three turbine engines, generating . However, the exhaust was trunked into a single centrally-located smokestack, reducing the overall length of the design and freeing deck space.\n\nThe main battery consisted of six 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns mounted in two twin gun turrets and two single gun turrets located on the centre line of the ship's axis in an arrangement which allowed one single and one twin turret to fire over the bow or stern. A single 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun and two 7.7 mm machine guns were located amidships on a raised platform for anti-aircraft defense. Two twin-mount torpedo launchers were also on the centerline of the ship's axis, one fore and aft of the anti-aircraft gun platform, with four loaded and four reserve Type 93 torpedoes. The fire control system was centralized into an enlarged bridge.\n\nThe ship was completed (13%) over the designed displacement, resulting in an extra foot of draft and a loss of in designed speed. The use of new technologies and unproven designs led to a number of issues which only became apparent once \"Yūbari\" was commissioned. The smoke stack was found to draw poorly, and was enlarged by 1.80 meters in 1924. Additional ballast was also added to increase stability. In 1932, the 80mm anti-aircraft gun was removed and in 1935, two twin Type 93 guns were fitted. These were replaced by two twin 25mm guns in 1940.\n\n\"Yūbari\" had a significant refit in early 1944 when the two single /50 main guns were removed and replaced by one Type 10 /45 gun (in the \"A\" position) and six twin and one triple Type 96 25-mm AA guns together with a Type 22 search radar and two depth charge launchers.\n\n\"Yūbari\" was laid down on 5 June 1922, launched on 5 March 1923 and completed at Sasebo Naval Arsenal, and commissioned on 23 July 1923.\n\nCompleted just prior to the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, \"Yūbari\" was quickly pressed into service to help evacuate refugees from Yokohama and other stricken areas. During this time (10 September 1923), Crown Prince Hirohito also visited the vessel while at Yokosuka. In April 1925, \"Yūbari\" shadowed maneuvers of the United States Navy off of Oahu. American destroyers gave chase, but \"Yūbari\" was able to outrun them. She was reassigned to the reserves in November 1933.\n\nIn November 1934, Captain Tadashige Daigo assumed command, and \"Yūbari\" was reassigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, where she was modernized and refitted in November 1935. Afterwards, she was assigned to patrols off of the China coast. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in August 1937, \"Yūbari\" assisted in the evacuation of Japanese civilians from coastal cities in southern China. Subsequently, she was sent north to cover landings by the Imperial Japanese Army at Hangzhou on 20 October. She returned to Yokosuka and was reassigned to the reserves in December of the same year. She was sent from March through October 1939 to the Ōminato Guard District to patrol the coast of Sakhalin .\nAt the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, \"Yūbari\" was flagship of Destroyer Squadron Six of the IJN 4th Fleet, tasked with the defense of the South Pacific Mandate, and was based out of Truk from late 1941 through 1942.\n\nEarly in the war, \"Yūbari\" was the flagship for the Japanese invasion force during the invasion of Wake Island. She led both invasion attempts on 11 and 23 December 1941. During shore bombardment operations, she was bracketed by gunfire from the USMC defenders, but took no damage.\n\nSubsequently, \"Yūbari\" and her destroyers participated in the capture of Rabaul and New Ireland in the Solomon Islands, followed by the Invasion of Salamaua–Lae on 8 March 1942. On 10 March, she was attacked by two Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers from the aircraft carrier , which scored two severe near-misses that killed a number of her anti-aircraft gun crews. She was then strafed by four Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat fighters from \"Lexington\", which killed her executive officer and several crewmen on her bridge. The following morning she was attacked again by aircraft from . \"Yorktown\"'s SBD-3s detonated gunpowder bags near her No. 2 turret, which set the protective mattresses around the bridge on fire, and an F4F-3 strafing run detonated gasoline drums stored in her port lifeboat. Firefighting teams found the fire hoses too short due to a design error and the fire threatened the forward torpedo mount. The captain ordered the torpedoes jettisoned but the mount would not rotate due to a power failure, forcing the crew to use pulleys and ropes to dump the torpedoes manually. During this battle \"Yūbari\" evaded 67 bombs and 12 torpedoes, suffering 13 killed and 49 wounded. She was bombed again on 10 March by four USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers while returning to Rabaul with four near-misses opening three large holes in her stern. She returned to Truk for repairs on 25 March.\n\n\"Yūbari\" was next assigned as the flagship of the Port Moresby Attack Force during Operation MO on 4 May. On 7 May she escaped an attack by four B-17 bombers without damage and rescued a number of survivors from the aircraft carrier , which had been sunk earlier. She returned to Truk on 13 May when the operation was cancelled following the Battle of the Coral Sea. She returned to Yokosuka for refit from 19 May to 19 June\n\nBeginning 29 June 1942, \"Yūbari\" took part in the Solomon Islands Campaign, including landing personnel on Guadalcanal to construct an airfield. From 17 June, she started to develop problems with her engines, and was limited to on two shafts. \"Yūbari\" participated in the Battle of Savo Island on 9 August. She scored several hits on the American destroyer , and one of the torpedoes that sank the heavy cruiser has been attributed to her.\n\nFrom 20 August, \"Yūbari\" was based out of Truk, making patrols between Truk and the Marshall islands, Gilbert Islands, and Palau. She was based at Tarawa from 20 October to 20 November as a guard ship.\nShe returned to Yokosuka at the end of December, where her middle turbine was repaired and additional anti-aircraft weaponry was installed in February 1943. She returned to Rabaul on 1 April and was assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet. On 2 July, \"Yūbari\" and her destroyers bombarded the American beachhead established at Rendova Island, but with little effect. On her return to Buin, \"Yūbari\" struck a naval mine, damaging her bow and wounding 26 crewmen. The damage also limited her speed to 22 knots and forced a return to Yokosuka for repairs from August through October. In addition to repairs, additional anti-aircraft guns, a Type 22 surface search radar and Type 94 sonar were installed. She returned to Rabaul on 3 November. On 4 November, she rescued 196 troops and three artillery pieces from the transport \"Kiyosumi Maru\", which had been damaged by a bombing attack the previous day. On 6 November, she undertook a \"Tokyo Express\" transport run with 700 troops from the IJA 17th Division and 25 tons of supplies to Bougainville Island. \"Yūbari\" was damaged slightly by a strafing attack in the 11 November Carrier Raid on Rabaul, and again on 14 November. On 18 November, she attempted another troop transport run to Garove Island in New Britain, but the mission was cancelled after \"Yūbari\" was damaged in an attack by USAAF B-24 Liberators and USN PBY Catalinas. She returned to Yokosuka on 19 December for repairs and the installation of yet more anti-aircraft guns. She returned to Saipan on 30 March 1944, and Palau on 25 April\n\n\"Yūbari\" was sighted on 27 April 1944 off Palau by the USN submarine on her first war patrol. Bluegill fired six torpedoes, of which \"Yūbari\" managed to evade four, but two hit on her starboard side near her Number 1 boiler room. Soon afterwards, her Number 2 boiler room was also flooded. She attempted to get underway using only her middle shaft, but the attempt failed, as did an attempt by the accompanying destroyer to take her in tow. \"Yūbari\" sank almost 24 hours after being torpedoed, at position , with the loss of 19 crewmen. She was officially removed from the navy list on 10 June 1944.\n\n\n"}

The game was played February 13, 2005, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. The final score was AFC 38 – NFC 27. The most valuable player was Peyton Manning of the Colts. The game holds the record as the latest Pro Bowl played during the calendar year, and the latest NFL game.\n\nThe game started off slowly. The AFC was forced to punt away its first possession, and the NFC missed a field goal from 43 yards out. Two plays later, the AFC opened up scoring with a 62-yard pass from Peyton Manning to his Indianapolis Colts teammate, Marvin Harrison. The NFC drove back quickly, but Donovan McNabb's pass was intercepted by Joey Porter. Manning then hooked up with Hines Ward for a 41-yard score, and the AFC led 14–0. The NFC came back with a time consuming drive that spanned the end of the first quarter to the beginning of the second, and ended with a 12-yard run by Brian Westbrook to bring the NFC within 7. However, David Akers' attempted onside kick would prove costly, as Ward recovered the kick and returned it 39 yards for a score, the first ever kickoff return for a touchdown in Pro Bowl history. Daunte Culpepper attempted to bring the NFC back, but was intercepted by Takeo Spikes. That interception led to another Manning touchdown, this time a 12-yard pass to Antonio Gates which gave the AFC a comfortable 28–7 lead. The NFC once again came down the field, led by Culpepper, but the drive was not without problems. On the second play, Torry Holt caught a pass but was hit by Tory James, causing a fumble. John Lynch recovered the fumble for the AFC, but the play was negated after a penalty on Marcus Stroud. Akers ended up kicking a 33-yard field goal to bring the score to 28–10, which is how the first half ended.\n\nThe third quarter was all NFC, who started off the half by scoring within the first 3 minutes, when Michael Vick hit Holt with a 27-yard pass to make the score 28–17. They later picked off Tom Brady when Lito Sheppard intercepted a pass on the NFC 31. The drive ended when Vick ran it in from 3 yards out, making the score 28–24. Adam Vinatieri and Akers then traded field goals before LaDainian Tomlinson added a rushing touchdown to make the score 38–27. The NFC made one final drive late in the game, but Vick was intercepted (the third pick of the game for the AFC) by Nate Clements, and Drew Brees kneeled to end the game.

Burke (born June 30, 1955) is an American-Canadian ice hockey analyst for Rogers Media broadcasts. Burke also served as a ice hockey executive, most recently as the president of hockey operations for the Calgary Flames. He has also served as the president and general manager for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and as the general manager for the Anaheim Ducks (winning the Stanley Cup with the team in 2007), the Vancouver Canucks, and the Hartford Whalers. Burke was also the general manager for the United States national men's ice hockey team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and is a member of Rugby Canada's board of directors.\n\nBorn in Providence, Rhode Island, and raised in Edina, Minnesota, in a family of ten children, Burke graduated from Providence College in 1977 with a bachelor of arts degree in history. While attending Providence, he played for the Friars Division-I ice hockey team, where, during his senior year, he served as captain. The team was coached by Lou Lamoriello. He was a teammate with Ron Wilson at Providence.\n\nIn 1977, Burke played seven games with the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League (AHL). He then proceeded to play one full year in the AHL with the Maine Mariners, who won the AHL Calder Cup championship that year. After one year in the AHL, Burke attended Harvard Law School, where he graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1981. After graduating, Burke became an NHL player agent.\n\nIn 1987, he was hired by Pat Quinn to be the director of hockey operations for the Vancouver Canucks. In the 1992–93 season, he left that job to become general manager of the Hartford Whalers. Burke stepped down after one year in Hartford, so he could join the NHL front office as executive vice president and director of hockey operations, under league commissioner Gary Bettman. In that role, he served as the league's chief disciplinarian.\n\nIn 1998, he became general manager of the Vancouver Canucks. With the Canucks, he was credited with reviving the ailing franchise and increasing attendance, with the drafting and signing of several key players such as Daniel Sedin, Henrik Sedin and Ryan Kesler, as the team won a playoff series and captured a division title. Following the 2003–04 NHL season, Canucks ownership chose not to renew Burke's contract for the GM position. Burke then briefly worked as an analyst for NHL games on both CBC and TSN. Burke's total record with the Canucks was 219-181-68-24.\n\nBurke won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks as the GM in the 2006–07 NHL season. It was his second year as an executive with the club.\n\nBurke stepped down as GM of the Anaheim Ducks on November 12, 2008. The Ducks management submitted papers to the NHL, releasing him from contractual commitment.\n\nOn November 29, 2008, Burke was introduced as the president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, replacing interim general manager Cliff Fletcher. He became the 13th non-interim general manager of the club and the first to be American-born. He reportedly agreed to a six-year deal worth $3 million annually. Soon thereafter, on December 4, 2008, Burke offered Dave Nonis the position of senior vice president and director of hockey operations for the Maple Leafs; Nonis accepted, marking the third time he has held this post under Burke; he had done so previously in Anaheim and Vancouver.\n\nBurke attended the World Hockey Summit hosted in Toronto in 2010, and wanted NHL participation in the Winter Olympics to continue, but felt that teams should receive financial compensation while the NHL season was on hiatus during the Olympics. He proposed allowing the NHL oversee a world championship which had potential to a financially lucrative venture while league games were not being played.\n\nOn January 9, 2013, Burke was fired by the Leafs as president and general manager and given a role as senior advisor to MLSE's president and C.O.O. Tom Anselmi and the MLSE board of directors. The advisory role would not relate to hockey matters. Burke was fired principally by team director George A. Cope, who campaigned the team's new ownership to make a change in team leadership. During Burke's tenure with the Leafs from November 2008 to January 2013, the team consistently failed to make the post-season and remained the only team in the League that was unable to do so following the 2004 lockout. With the Leafs, Burke amassed a record of 129-135-42.\n\nDuring his time in Toronto, Burke was notably criticized for a controversial trade in 2009 with Boston, when he acquired sniper Phil Kessel for two first-round draft picks and a second-round selection. The Bruins used the picks to select star forward Tyler Seguin, Dougie Hamilton and Jared Knight. Burke was also criticized for taking personal leaves to visit troops overseas during prime free agency dates on multiple occasions.\n\nIn December 2011, Burke drew criticism in the media for his mid-season extension of head coach Ron Wilson, with whom he was notably friends. \"Burke and Wilson were born a month apart, were college roommates and teammates on the Providence College Friars hockey team in Rhode Island in the 1970s and have been friends ever since. Despite Wilson's three consecutive losing seasons, Burke renewed Wilson's contract with a $2 million extension. News of the contract broke on social media site Twitter, where Wilson posted that \"This Xmas could be better if Santa stuffs a certain piece of paper in my stocking\" and \"'He came! He came!' [...] I got a new Red Ryder BB gun and a contract extension!\", to which Burke replied, \"Congratulations to Ron Wilson on his contract extension! Merry Christmas Ron!\" Later, Burke defended his decision in the media, stating \"This is a coach who's earned this, a coach who's earned this extension,\" and \"It's not charity. It's not a gift.\" However, Wilson was released with full pay three months later following mounting losses and jeers from fans. \"Every coach has a shelf life,\" Burke said. \"After the last home game, it would be cruel and unusual punishment to let Ron coach another game in the Air Canada Centre.\"\n\nOn September 5, 2013, Burke was named the president of hockey operations for the Calgary Flames; a role not held by any other NHL club except the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Edmonton Oilers. A president of hockey operations is not to be confused with a team's president. A president of hockey operations sits between president (or owner) and general manager within a club's hierarchy. It is strictly an advisory position assuming little to no direct responsibility for team decisions. After firing Jay Feaster and John Weisbrod, he became the acting general manager during the search for a permanent GM. On April 28, 2014, Burke hired Brad Treliving as the permanent GM of the Calgary Flames.\n\nAfter nearly five years on the job, Burke stepped back from his role as president of the Flames' hockey operations on April 27, 2018.\n\nFollowing his departure from the Calgary Flames, Burke joined Rogers Media as an ice hockey analyst during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs in April 2018. He has since continued working as a hockey analyst with Sportsnet and on Hockey Night in Canada.\n\nA dual citizen of the United States and Canada, Burke has two daughters with ex-wife Jennifer Mather Burke, an anchor at CTV News Channel.\n\nBurke also has four children from a previous marriage, including Patrick, a former scout for the Philadelphia Flyers and as of 2015 a director in the NHL's Department of Player Safety. Burke is a strong supporter of gay rights and attended the 2009 Toronto Gay Pride Parade with his son Brendan Burke, who was gay.\nOn February 5, 2010, Brendan died at age 21 from injuries suffered in a car accident in Indiana.\nBrian Burke also participated in the 2010 and 2011 Toronto Gay Pride parades. On March 4, 2012, Burke and his son Patrick launched the You Can Play project in honor of Brendan, which is targeted at ending homophobia in sports.\n\nOn April 26, 2013, Burke filed a lawsuit against 18 individuals who had anonymously posted on websites that the actual reason Burke was fired from the Maple Leafs was for allegedly having an affair with a female sportscaster and fathering her child. Burke said the claims were false and defamatory and, despite the costs which deter most victims of false statements on the Internet, he would seek court orders to disclose the names of those involved.\n\nWhile the anonymity of the defendants has proved bringing the lawsuit to a civil trial problematic, Burke was able to achieve a minor victory in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, when they ruled anonymous defendants could be served notice of the proceedings through the private messaging on the message boards with which they made slanderous statements. , Burke and his legal team have made some progress in tracking down the identities of several of the individuals and have forced them to make retractions.\n\n"}

The shoreline length is 14.3 km.\n\nLower Seletar Reservoir was constructed under the Sungei Seletar/Bedok Water Scheme, completed in 1986. The scheme involved the damming of Sungei Seletar to form Lower Seletar Reservoir, the creation of Bedok Reservoir from a former sand quarry and the construction of Bedok Waterworks. Its unique feature was the construction of nine stormwater collection stations to tap the storm runoffs of the surrounding urbanised catchments. Eight of these collection stations are ponds at Yishun, Tampines, Bedok and Yan Kit.\n\nIn 2004, Public Utilities Board (PUB) allowed sailing at Lower Seletar Reservoir. This was done in collaboration with the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the Seletar Country Club. This is the first time sailing was introduced in local reservoirs. Sports fishing is also carried out at designated areas of the Lower Seletar Reservoir.\n\nLocated on the northern shore of Lower Seletar Reservoir, the Lower Seletar Reservoir Park is largely flat with some undulating terrain that provides a pleasant place for a leisurely stroll or jog.

The special case where the numbers \"z\"...,\"z\" are all algebraic is the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem. If, on the other hand, the numbers are chosen so as to make exp(\"z\")...,exp(\"z\") all algebraic then one would prove that linearly independent logarithms of algebraic numbers are algebraically independent, a strengthening of Baker's theorem.\n\nThe Gelfond–Schneider theorem follows from this strengthened version of Baker's theorem, as does the currently unproven four exponentials conjecture.\n\nSchanuel's conjecture, if proved, would also settle whether numbers such as \"e\" +  and \"e\" are algebraic or transcendental, and prove that \"e\" and are algebraically independent simply by setting \"z\" = 1 and \"z\" = \"i\", and using Euler's identity.\n\nEuler's identity states that \"e\" + 1 = 0. If Schanuel's conjecture is true then this is, in some precise sense involving exponential rings, the \"only\" relation between \"e\", , and \"i\" over the complex numbers.\n\nAlthough ostensibly a problem in number theory, the conjecture has implications in model theory as well. Angus Macintyre and Alex Wilkie, for example, proved that the theory of the real field with exponentiation, , is decidable provided Schanuel's conjecture is true. In fact they only needed the real version of the conjecture, defined below, to prove this result, which would be a positive solution to Tarski's exponential function problem.\n\nThe converse Schanuel conjecture is the following statement: \n\nA version of Schanuel's conjecture for formal power series, also by Schanuel, was proven by James Ax in 1971. It states:\n\nAs stated above, the decidability of follows from the real version of Schanuel's conjecture which is as follows:\nA related conjecture called the uniform real Schanuel's conjecture essentially says the same but puts a bound on the integers \"m\". The uniform real version of the conjecture is equivalent to the standard real version. Macintyre and Wilkie showed that a consequence of Schanuel's conjecture, which they dubbed the Weak Schanuel's conjecture, was equivalent to the decidability of . This conjecture states that there is a computable upper bound on the norm of non-singular solutions to systems of exponential polynomials; this is, non-obviously, a consequence of Schanuel's conjecture for the reals.\n\nIt is also known that Schanuel's conjecture would be a consequence of conjectural results in the theory of motives. In this setting Grothendieck's period conjecture for an abelian variety \"A\" states that the transcendence degree of its period matrix is the same as the dimension of the associated Mumford–Tate group, and what is known by work of Pierre Deligne is that the dimension is an upper bound for the transcendence degree. Bertolin has shown how a generalised period conjecture includes Schanuel's conjecture.\n\nWhile a proof of Schanuel's conjecture seems a long way off, connections with model theory have prompted a surge of research on the conjecture.\n\nIn 2004, Boris Zilber systematically constructed exponential fields \"K\" that are algebraically closed and of characteristic zero, and such that one of these fields exists for each uncountable cardinality. He axiomatised these fields and, using Hrushovski's construction and techniques inspired by work of Shelah on categoricity in infinitary logics, proved that this theory of \"pseudo-exponentiation\" has a unique model in each uncountable cardinal. Schanuel's conjecture is part of this axiomatisation, and so the natural conjecture that the unique model of cardinality continuum is actually isomorphic to the complex exponential field implies Schanuel's conjecture. In fact, Zilber showed that this conjecture holds if and only if both Schanuel's conjecture and another unproven condition on the complex exponentiation field, which Zilber calls exponential-algebraic closedness, hold. As this construction can also give models with counterexamples of Schanuel's conjecture, this method cannot prove Schanuel's conjecture.\n"}

To get this information, a hacker might use various tools and technologies. This information is very useful to a hacker who is trying to crack a whole system.\n\nWhen used in the computer security lexicon, \"Footprinting\" generally refers to one of the pre-attack phases; tasks performed before doing the actual attack. Some of the tools used for Footprinting are Sam Spade, nslookup, traceroute, Nmap and neotrace.\n\n\nWireshark\n\nIt allows a hacker to gain information about the target system or network. This information can be used to carry out attacks on the system. That is the reason by which it may be named a Pre-Attack, since all the information is reviewed in order to get a complete and successful resolution of the attack. Footprinting is also used by ethical hackers and penetration testers to find security flaws and vulnerabilities within their own company's network before a malicious hacker does.\n\nThere are two types of Footprinting that can be used: active Footprinting and passive Footprinting. Active Footprinting is the process of using tools and techniques, such as performing a ping sweep or using the traceroute command, to gather information on a target. Active Footprinting can trigger a target's Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and may be logged, and thus requires a level of stealth to successfully do. Passive Footprinting is the process of gathering information on a target by innocuous, or, passive, means. Browsing the target's website, visiting social media profiles of employees, searching for the website on WHOIS, and performing a Google search of the target are all ways of passive Footprinting. Passive Footprinting is the stealthier method since it will not trigger a target's IDS or otherwise alert the target of information being gathered.\n\nCrawling is the process of surfing the internet to get the required information about the target. The sites surfed can include the target's website, blogs and social networks. The information obtained by this method will be helpful in other methods.\n\nWHOIS is a web application used to get information about the target website, such as the administrator's e-mail address and details about the registration. WHOIS is a very large database and contains information of approximately all clearnet websites. It can be searched by domain name. \n\nSearch engines such as Google can also be used to gather information about the target system. It depends on how well one knows how to use search engines to collect information. If used properly, the attacker can gather lots of information about a company, its career and its policies etc.\n\nInformation can also be gathered using the command Tracert (\"traceroute\"), which is used to trace a path between a user and the target system on the networks. That way it becomes clear where a request is being forwarded and through which devices. In Linux systems, the tracepath and traceroute commands are also available for doing traceroute operations.\n\nNegative web search will reveal some other websites when performed on the target website. Negative websites can act as resources for insight about the flaws of the target website.\n\nIf the attack is to be performed on a company, then the following information will be gathered.\n\nBasics of Footprinting\n"}

The design represented an intermediate class between the light cruiser and the destroyer, which had few counterparts in other navies of the time, although it was inspired by a similar concept to the Royal Navy's and s. The Imperial Japanese Navy and Japanese shipbuilding industry were still closely associated with the British due to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and were able to improve on the British experience.\n\nThe \"Tenryū\"-class vessels, termed \"small-model\" (or \"3,500-Ton\") cruisers, were designed as fast flotilla leaders for the Imperial Navy's new first- and second-class destroyers. With improvements in oil-fired turbine engine technology and the use of Brown Curtiss geared turbine engines, the \"Tenryū\" class had more than twice the horsepower of the previous , and were capable of the high speed of , which was deemed necessary in their role as flagships for destroyer squadrons. However, by the time of their completion, newer Japanese destroyers, such as the had a design speed of 39 knots, and newer American cruisers, such as the also exceeded it in firepower.\n\nHowever, in terms of weaponry, the \"Tenryū\" class was weaker than any other contemporary cruiser. The main battery consisted of four 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, which were also utilized as the secondary battery on the s. However, the guns were situated in single mounts on the centerline, with only a limited angle of fire, and could fire only one gun at a target immediately in front or aft of the vessel. A further weakness was the lack of room for anti-aircraft guns. Despite awareness increasing about the growing threat of aircraft to surface ships, the secondary battery of the \"Tenryū\" class consisted of only a single dual-purpose 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns, plus two 6.5 mm machine guns. The class also was the first to use triple torpedo launchers, with two centerline-mounted Type 6 21-inch launchers. No reloads were carried.\n\n\"Tenryū\" was completed on 20 November 1919, at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, and was assigned as flagship of the 2nd Destroyer Squadron based at Kure Naval District, under the IJN 2nd Fleet.\n\nThe following year, \"Tenryū\" was assigned to patrols of the east coast of Russia, providing support to Japanese troops in the Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army. She was transferred to the reserves at Kure on 20 April, but was reactivated from 1 December 1921 - 1 December 1922, and again from 1 December 1923 – 1 December 1925, alternating active duty periods with her sister ship \"Tatsuta\" as flagship of the 1st Destroyer Squadron. From 5 February 1927, she was assigned to patrols of the mouth of the Yangtze River.\n\nAfter minor renovation in late 1927, \"Tenryū\" once again became flagship of the 1st Destroyer Squadron. From 1 December 1928, she was assigned back to Kure, serving as a training vessel for the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy and Submarine School. In 1930, she was given a tripod foremast.\n\nOn 9 October 1931, \"Tenryū\" was assigned to patrols of the Yangtze River in China as part of the IJN 3rd Fleet, and was thus in combat during the January 28 Incident at Shanghai in 1932. She returned to Japan in October 1933, and from November 1934 was again based at Kure. On 26 September 1935, during fleet maneuvers in a typhoon, \"Tatsuta\" (along with several other vessels) suffered hull damage in what later came to be known as the Fourth Fleet Incident. Repair work at Kure Naval Arsenal lasted until May 1936.\n\nFrom November 1936, \"Tenryū\" was paired with her sister ship \"Tatsuta\" in the 10th Cruiser Squadron of the IJN 3rd Fleet, replacing the cruiser . As the situation between Japan and China deteriorated into the Second Sino-Japanese War, \"Tenryū\" supported the landings of the Imperial Japanese Army and Japanese naval forces in Shanghai, and the blockade of the Chinese coast. As a component of the IJN 5th Fleet, on 10 May 1938 she covered the landing of Japanese forces at Amoy and on 1 July 1938 supported operations in Guangzhou. \"Tatsuta\" and \"Tenryū\" operated in Chinese waters until 14 December 1938, when they were withdrawn from front line service and assigned to the reserves. From 1 December 1939, \"Tenryū\" was based at Maizuru Naval District as a guard ship and training vessel for the Imperial Japanese Navy Engineering Academy.\n\nHowever, from 15 November 1940, in preparation for the upcoming hostilities with the United States, \"Tenryū\" and \"Tatsuta\" were extensively modernized and renovated. Their coal/oil boilers were replaced with oil-fired boilers and a steel roof replaced the former canvas covering of the bridge. The two Type 93 AA machine guns (which had been added in 1937) were replaced with two twin-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns.\n\nFrom 12 September 1941, \"Tatsuta\" and \"Tenryū\" were redeployed to Truk, in the Caroline Islands, as CruDiv 18 of the Fourth Fleet. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, CruDiv 18 had deployed from Kwajalein as part of the Wake Island invasion force. \"Tenryū\" bombarded shore installations during the first Battle of Wake Island, and also participated in the second (successful) invasion attempt on Wake Island on 21 December.\n\nOn 20 January 1942, \"Tatsuta\" and \"Tenryū\" were assigned to cover troop transports during the invasion of Kavieng, New Ireland and Gasmata, New Britain from 3–9 February, and patrolled from Truk in late February.\n\nDuring a refit at Truk on 23 February, two additional Type 96 twin-mount 25 mm AA guns were installed aft, as part of the heightened awareness of the threat posed by American aircraft.\n\nFrom March, \" Tenryū\" with CruDiv 18 covered numerous troop landings throughout the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, including Lae and Salamaua, Buka, Bougainville, Rabaul, Shortland, and Kieta, and Manus Island, Admiralty Islands, and Tulagi returning to Truk on 10 April.\n\n\"Tatsuta\" and \"Tenryū\" were both assigned to the aborted \"Operation Mo\" (the occupation of Port Moresby, and covered the establishment of a seaplane base at Rekata Bay at Santa Isabel Island from 3–5 May. The operation was cancelled following the Battle of the Coral Sea, and \"Tatsuta\" was recalled to Maizuru Naval Arsenal in Japan for repairs on 24 May, remaining for a month. On 23 June, she returned to Truk. \"Tatsuta\" and \"Tenryū\" escorted a convoy to Guadalcanal on 6 July, which contained an engineering battalion assigned to build an airstrip.\n\nOn 14 July 1942, in a major reorganization of the Japanese navy, CruDiv 18 under Rear Admiral Mitsuharu Matsuyama came under the newly created Eighth Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and based at Rabaul. On 20 July, \"Tenryū\" was assigned to cover Japanese troop landings in the invasion of Buna, New Guinea (\"Operation RI\"). The invasion force was attacked by USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresss and Martin B-26 Marauder bombers on its return to Rabaul, but \"Tenryū\" was unharmed.\n\nOn 9 August 1942, \"Tenryū\" was in the Battle of Savo Island, together with the cruisers , , , , , and , and the destroyer , which attacked US Task Group 62.6 that was screening transports with Allied invasion forces for Guadalcanal. During nighttime gun and torpedo action, \"Tenryū\" sank the cruiser with two torpedoes. She also contributed to sinking the cruisers , , and . In addition, the cruiser and destroyers and were damaged. \"Tenryū\" was hit by \"Chicago\", with 23 crewmen killed. \"Tenryū\" remained based out of Rabaul through the end of August, escorting convoys of troops and supplies.,\n\nOn 25 August, \"Tenryū\" covered of the landing of 1,200 troops of the Kure No. 5 Special Naval Landing Force at Milne Bay, New Guinea (\"Operation RE\"), and on 6 September, was part of the force assigned to evacuate the surviving troops after their defeat, and in the process bombarded the Gili Gili wharves and sank the 3,199-ton British freighter \"Anshun\".\n\nOn 2 October, \"Tenryū\" was hit by a bomb dropped by a B-17 of the 19th Bomb Group, Fifth Air Force while at Rabaul. The bomb killed 30 crewmen, but the ship was not severely damaged. \"Tenryū\" was then tasked with Tokyo Express transport runs from Rabaul to Tassafaronga, Guadalcanal, through early November, evacuating 190 members of the Sasebo No.5 Special Night Operations Landing Force on 26 October and narrowly escaping a torpedo launched by on 3 November off Santa Isabel Island. On 8 November, \"Tenryū\" was attacked by PT boats (\"PT-37\", \"PT-39\", and \"PT-61\") off Cape Tassafaronga, but escaped without damage.\n\nOn 13 November 1942, \"Tenryū\" departed Shortland for Guadalcanal as part of the Japanese task force for the bombardment of Henderson Field. The task force was attacked the next day by and torpedo bombers from and Marine Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo-bombers from Guadalcanal. During the subsequent battle, \"Kinugasa\" was sunk and \"Chōkai\" was slightly damaged. A Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber crashed into the cruiser . \"Tenryū\" was undamaged and returned to Shortland.\n\nOn 16 December 1942, \"Tenryū\" departed for Madang, New Guinea, in an attack force with the destroyers , , , and and the armed merchant cruisers \"Aikoku Maru\" and \"Gokoku Maru\", successfully landing its forces on 18 December.\n\nThe following day, as \"Tenryū\" was departing, it was attacked by the submarine , which fired three torpedoes each at a transport and what it identified as a destroyer. The torpedoes missed the transport, but one hit \"Tenryū\" in the stern. \"Tenryū\" sank at 23:20 on 19 December 1942, at . Twenty-three crewmen were lost, but \"Suzukaze\" rescued the survivors, including Captain Mitsuharu Ueda.\n\n\"Tenryū\" was struck from the navy list on 20 January 1943.\n\n\n"}

It is the only one of the band's albums to feature the original trio line-up with Clive Palmer, Robin Williamson and Mike Heron.\n\nThe trio had been signed to Elektra Records by Joe Boyd, who had seen them play in Glasgow. They recorded the album at the Sound Techniques studio in Chelsea, London in one afternoon in May 1966, with Boyd as producer. Boyd insisted on focusing on the group's own self-written material, rather than the traditional songs and tunes which they had also been performing, and with each performer singing his own material. This had the effect of marginalising Palmer, who had only one of his own songs featured on the record and only played on five songs in total. Less than half of the album featured collective performance. Nine of the album's sixteen songs were solo performances (five by Williamson, three by Heron and one by Palmer). Of the remaining seven songs, four were duets and only three featured all three musicians together.\n\nThe album showcased the trio's abilities on a variety of instruments, although the instrumentation is relatively orthodox compared to the band's later work. All three members played guitar and sang, with Palmer also playing banjo and kazoo and Williamson playing mandolin, banjo, tin whistle and fiddle/violin. The psychedelic imagery for which the band would become known is less prevalent on this album than on their later albums, although the liner notes, by Heron, include a surreal tale of the band's encounter with a magic blackbird. However, the album does contain unconventional tunes and singing styles.\n\nThe album was released in Britain in September 1966, and in the USA on Elektra in April 1967 (as attested in \"Billboard\" magazine's new album releases in the 9-15 April 1967 issue). The original LP sleeve used in the UK featured a photograph of the band holding up obscure musical instruments in Boyd's office in London. For the US issue, a different photo was used, showing the three musicians posed on what appears to be a rusting bus.\n\n\"The Incredible String Band\" did not chart when released, but in the UK following the Top 5 success of \"The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter\" it went to number 34 during a three-week run in the summer of 1968.\n\nThe trio broke up immediately after recording the album, but Heron and Williamson reunited after a few months to continue the band's name as a duo, later augmented by other musicians.\n\n\"The Incredible String Band\" won the title of \"Folk Album of the Year\" in \"Melody Maker\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s annual poll, and in a 1968 \"Sing Out!\" magazine interview Bob Dylan praised Williamson's \"October Song\" as one of his favorite songs of that period. Heron would later describe this album as his own favourite of the band's releases.\n\nIn their retrospective review, Lindsay Planer of AllMusic praised the album, calling it \"their most simple [album]. It is this minimalism that allowed the natural radiance of the band's (mostly) original material to be evident in the purist sense, and likewise without many of the somewhat intricate distractions and musical tangents that their future work would incorporate\".\n\n"}

The \"in vitro\" affinity maturation has successfully been used to optimize antibodies, antibody fragments or other peptide molecules like antibody mimetics. Random mutations inside the CDRs are introduced using radiation, chemical mutagens or error-prone PCR. In addition, the genetic diversity can be increased by chain shuffling. Two or three rounds of mutation and selection using display methods like phage display usually results in antibody fragments with affinities in the low nanomolar range.\n"}

The term is used to imply that an individual or group keeps this support or admiration hidden to avoid political persecution or political suicide. The common usage is \"crypto-fascist\", one who practices this support. In some circumstances, it may also be a cognate for \"quasi-fascist\" and refer to a person who is viewed as holding fascistic beliefs which stop short of conscious support for the ideology of fascism. \nThe Oxford English Dictionary cites several early uses, including \"The Guardian\" using the term more than once in the 1920s. In an ABC television debate during the chaos of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Gore Vidal described William F. Buckley, Jr. as a \"crypto-Nazi\", later correcting himself as meaning to say \"crypto-fascist\". However, the term had appeared five years earlier in a German-language book by the sociologist Theodor W. Adorno, \"Der getreue Korrepetitor\" (The Faithful Répétiteur).\n\nThe term was famously used by German Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll in a 1972 essay (titled \"\") that was sharply critical of the tabloid newspaper Bild's coverage of the Baader-Meinhof Gang left-wing terrorist organization. In the essay, Böll stated that what \"Bild\" does \"isn’t cryptofascist anymore, not fascistoid, but naked fascism. Agitation, lies, dirt.\"\n\nIn colloquial use, crypto-fascism can sometimes describe the means through which cryptofascists engage in public discourse, using methods that would not explicitly reveal their nature, while still supporting their goals through dog-whistle politics or by attempting to engage in conversations that are critical to their beliefs. This is done with the intent to shift the focus away from criticism, often onto some minor detail or tangent.\n\n\n"}

He was arrested and interned in May 1940. He was held in Britain for several months, then sent to internment camps near Quebec City and soon afterwards, Farnham, Quebec. In both camps, he was elected camp leader by fellow inmates.\n\nHe renounced his German citizenship in 1947. He was naturalised as a British citizen in October 1947 under the name \"Friedrich von Preussen\" (having also been known during residence in the UK as \"George Mansfield\"). This naturalization was controversial, in part because being a descendant of Sophia of Hanover, and having rights under the Act of Settlement 1701, as amended by the Sophia Naturalisation Act 1705, he had a claim to British citizenship from birth. His status in context of his claim for compensation for property seized in Poland was debated in Parliament and the law courts until 1961.\n\nHe was the owner of Reinhartshausen Castle at Erbach, Germany.

From 1899, he worked in the Psychiatric Clinic in Prague. In 1914, he was named professor. During World War I Janský served two years as a doctor at the front until a heart attack disabled him. After the war he worked as a neuropsychiatrist in a military Hospital (\"Vojenská nemocnice\"). He had angina pectoralis and died of ischaemic heart disease.\n\nJanský was also a proponent of voluntary blood donations.\n\nThrough his psychiatric research, Janský tried to find a correlation between mental diseases and blood diseases. He found no such correlation existed and published a study, \"Hematologická studie u psychotiků\" (1907, \"Hematological study of psychotics\"), in which he classified blood into four groups I, II, III, IV. At the time this discovery passed almost unnoticed. In 1921 an American medical commission acknowledged Janský's classification (over that of Karl Landsteiner, who classified blood into only three groups; and was for this (blood types) discovery awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930). Janský's classification remains in use today. A similar classification was described by William Lorenzo Moss, except the I and IV of Moss were the opposite to that of Janský's, leading to confusion in blood transfusion until the use of A, B and O became standard.\n\n\n"}

The special broadcasts primarily from New York City's Times Square and prominently features coverage of its annual ball drop event, along with live and pre-recorded musical performances by popular musicians from Times Square and Hollywood, in addition to live performances and coverage of festivities from New Orleans.\n\nIts creator and namesake was the entertainer Dick Clark, who conceived \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" as a younger-skewing competitor to Guy Lombardo's popular and long-running New Year's Eve big band broadcasts on CBS. The first two editions, in 1973 and 1974, were hosted by Three Dog Night and George Carlin, respectively, featured Dick Clark assuming the role of Times Square reporter, and were broadcast by NBC. In 1974–75, the program moved to its current home of ABC, and Clark assumed the role of host.\n\nFollowing the death of Guy Lombardo and the decline of CBS's specials, \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" grew in popularity and became ingrained in pop culture—even prompting Clark himself to make appearances on other programs in parody of his role. To this day, \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" has consistently remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers—not including viewers watching from public locations, which were historically not measured by Nielsen.\n\nDick Clark hosted \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" annually from 1973 through 1999 and from 2001 through 2004. For 2000, in lieu of New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, Clark joined overall host Peter Jennings as a guest co-host in Times Square for ABC News’ day-long \"ABC 2000 Today\" broadcast. In December 2004, Clark suffered from a stroke, which resulted in Regis Philbin serving as guest host. Due to lingering speech impediments from the stroke, Clark ceded hosting duties to Ryan Seacrest the following year, but continued to make limited appearances as a co-host until his death in 2012 (despite his death, his name still remains on the program to this day). Hosting solo since the 2012–13 edition, Seacrest has typically been joined by Jenny McCarthy as a correspondent from Times Square, with Ciara serving as the presenter of the Hollywood concert segments. Through its deal with Dick Clark Productions, \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" will remain on ABC through at least 2024.\n\n\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" is primarily broadcast from Times Square in New York City, providing coverage of the New Year's Eve festivities held there, including performances by popular musicians, and culminating with the long-running ball drop approaching midnight. The special also features pre-recorded performances; since the 2017–18 edition, these concert segments (branded since the 2014–15 edition as the \"\"Billboard\" Hollywood Party\") have been presented from a studio in Los Angeles by Ciara. Since 2016–17, the special has also originated performances from New Orleans, hosted from the Sugar Bowl's \"Fan Fest\" event (the game itself is televised by ABC's sister sports network ESPN the next day).\n\nSince 2005, Ryan Seacrest has hosted the live show outside in Times Square, joined by a celebrity correspondent providing additional reports from attendees. From his return and until his death, Dick Clark hosted a limited number of segments from Times Square Studios throughout the broadcast, including the countdown. Clark carried on with his tradition of kissing his wife, Kari Wigton, at midnight.\n\nSince 2000–01's edition, coverage has begun with a segment airing in primetime: initially airing at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT, beginning with the 2011-12 edition, the show was extended to 8:00 p.m. ET/PT to accommodate musical retrospective specials that aired from the 2011–12 to 2013–14 editions. These specials primarily featured music countdowns with footage from the Dick Clark Productions archives, including the top \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" performances of all-time, and the top women in music. On the 2014–15 edition, the retrospective specials were dropped, with the two-hour block now referred to as \"Part 1\" of the \"Primetime\" portion of the program, with the 10:00 p.m. hour considered \"Part 2\".\n\nFollowing late local programming (such as late-night newscasts), the main \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" broadcast begins at 11:30 p.m. ET/PT; some stations may tape delay this segment in order to correspond to the local time zone. Since the 2016–17 edition, the live coverage from Times Square has been followed by live coverage of festivities from New Orleans, including Jackson Square's fleur-de-lis drop at midnight in the Central Time Zone. After the conclusion of live coverage, the special continues into \"Part 2\", which features the remainder of the Hollywood concert segments. Part 2 runs into the early morning hours, and has run as late as 3:00 a.m. ET/PT in the past.\n\nPrior to the premiere of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", the most well-known New Year's Eve program was the annual big band remote of bandleader Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians, broadcast from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Guy Lombardo hosted 48 straight New Year's Eve broadcasts on CBS until his death in 1977, beginning on radio in 1928 (and for a period, splitting with NBC Radio following midnight ET), and on CBS Television from 1956 to 1976 (which also featured coverage of the ball drop in Times Square). Lombardo was also well known for his band's performance of the song \"Auld Lang Syne\" at midnight, which helped make the standard synonymous with the New Year's holiday in North America.\n\nAt the time, Dick Clark was well known to viewers as the host of \"American Bandstand\", a music series produced from the studios of Philadelphia television station WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV) and broadcast by ABC (which itself aired a New Year's Eve special on December 31, 1959).\n\nIn the 1970s, Clark felt that Guy Lombardo's New Year's specials were outdated and did not appeal well to younger viewers; he believed that only older viewers would be interested in big band music accompanied by \"people dancing cheek-to-jowl in their tuxedos and funny hats.\" In response, he decided to produce a more youthful New Year's Eve special of his own to compete. Clark's new program would be known as \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", a name chosen to signify the major contrast between his special and the more formal atmosphere of Guy Lombardo's special. The first edition, Three Dog Night's New Year's Rockin' Eve, was aired by NBC on December 31, 1972 and was hosted by the members of the rock band Three Dog Night. The special featured pre-recorded musical performances from the ballroom of the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California by Blood, Sweat & Tears, Helen Reddy, Al Green, and Three Dog Night. Clark served as a reporter from Times Square for live coverage of the ball drop and arrival of 1973. The second special, New Year's Rockin' Eve 1974, also on NBC, was hosted by comedian George Carlin and featured pre-recorded musical performances by The Pointer Sisters, Billy Preston, Linda Ronstadt and Tower of Power once again from the Queen Mary ballroom. Beginning with the 1975 edition, the program moved to ABC and Clark assumed hosting duties; billed as Chicago's New Year's Rockin' Eve 1975 and seen as part of \"ABC's Wide World of Entertainment\" late-night block, the first ABC edition was headlined by the rock group Chicago, with guests The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, Herbie Hancock and Olivia Newton-John, in segments pre-recorded at MGM Studios in Hollywood.\n\nAfter Guy Lombardo's death in 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians attempted to continue their New Year's Eve broadcasts from the Waldorf-Astoria for 1977–78. However, the effects of Lombardo's absence led to a decline in viewership, allowing \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" to overtake the Royal Canadians in viewership in only its fifth year on-air. The threat of the new special also prompted CBS to drop the Royal Canadians entirely in 1979 in favor of a new special, \"Happy New Year, America\", which premiered for New Year's Eve 1979–80. With its recent success, Clark began hoping that \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" would become a television tradition of its own, lamenting that \"Lombardo would always win [in New York] because of the Waldorf and 35 years of tradition, but we finally got it wrested.\" Clark's hopes soon became reality, as \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" had displaced Guy Lombardo as the most popular and most-watched New Year's Eve special on American television in the years following.\n\nThe 1980 edition was co-hosted by Erin Moran and John Schneider of \"Happy Days\" and \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" respectively, and continued with Clark's goal to showcase acts that represented the previous year by featuring Barry Manilow, Blondie, Chic, The Oak Ridge Boys, and the Village People as performers. The 1988 edition was co-hosted by \"China Beach\" cast members Marg Helgenberger and Brian Wimmer from the Cocoanut Grove club at the Ambassador Hotel. Mark Curry and Holly Robinson of the ABC sitcom \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\" co-hosted for 1993–94, with segments at Walt Disney World featuring performances by acts such as Brooks and Dunn and Kiss, along with the marriage of two California firefighters, Laura Turpin and Bob Hutnyan.\n\nThe 1994–95 edition was co-hosted with Margaret Cho and Steve Harvey, and included musical performances from Melissa Etheridge, Hootie & the Blowfish and Salt-N-Pepa.\n\nThe 1996–97 edition was co-hosted by Stacey Dash and Donald Faison of the ABC comedy series \"Clueless\", and included performances by Jann Arden, Kiss, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, The Presidents of the United States of America, and The Tony Rich Project. This edition also marked the 25th anniversary of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\"; Clark marked this accomplishment by discussing the greatest challenges he had faced hosting the special; including being unable to hear his director over the loud crowds of Times Square, harsh weather conditions, and a year where the emcee had to contend with a group of 30 nude attendees in the background. Clark aimed to continue hosting the special through the year 2000. Ultimately, Clark hosted the program nearly uninterrupted through 2004. The late-night portion of the 1997–98 edition was followed by a second, hour-long special at 1:05 a.m., \"After New Year's Eve\", which was hosted by David Sanborn and featured Boz Scaggs, Isaac Hayes, Dr. John, Joan Osborne, Lou Reed, and Naughty by Nature.\n\nThe popularity of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" also resulted in Clark making appearances on other television series to reference his role. During a Y2K-themed short in \"The Simpsons\"' 1999 Halloween special \"Treehouse of Horror X\", Clark made a cameo appearance hosting a New Year's Eve event in Springfield. The Y2K bug caused the emcee to melt, exposing him as a robot. In an interview following the episode's airing with its writer, Ron Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the \"biggest response\" he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. Clark made a further appearance during the pilot episode of fellow Matt Groening series \"Futurama\", \"Space Pilot 3000\", where Clark's head (as preserved in a jar) hosts \"New Year's Rockin' Eve 3000\". In the 1994 film \"Forrest Gump\", footage of Clark from the first edition of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" is seen on a television at a bar during a scene of the film taking place on New Year's Eve in 1972. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" was also the subject of an episode of the sitcom \"Friends\", \"The One with the Routine\", in which Janine Lecroix invites Joey, Ross, and Monica to attend a studio taping for \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" as audience members.\n\nOn December 31, 1999, in lieu of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", ABC News presented \"ABC 2000 Today\", a day-long telecast hosted by Peter Jennings which, as part of a consortium of broadcasters, presented coverage of international and U.S. festivities celebrating the arrival of the year 2000. Clark joined Jennings and ABC News reporter Jack Ford as correspondents for coverage from Times Square. They were among the key members of the team of more than 1,000 members of the ABC News division in New York, London, and elsewhere around the world that were part of the broadcast, which also included correspondents/anchors Charles Gibson, Diane Sawyer, Barbara Walters, and Sam Donaldson and London Bureau chief Rex Granum. They were all under the direction of ABC's Roger Goodman. The \"ABC 2000 Today\" telecast overall also received a Peabody Award. Reflecting on the event, Clark was enthusiastic about his participation, feeling that New Year's Eve 2000 was one of the biggest nights he had ever spent in Times Square.\n\n\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" returned to ABC the following New Year's Eve for the arrival of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted to know what was going on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by \"Fox & Friends\" anchor Steve Doocy, and Madison Michelle as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by 98 Degrees, Baha Men, Boyz II Men, Lonestar, and Third Eye Blind among others.\n\nThe 2002 edition of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", its 29th edition, featured pre-recorded concert performances from tours by Aerosmith, Destiny's Child, and Elton John during the primetime hour, followed by studio segments (again hosted by Wayne Brady) featuring performances by Blink-182, Bush, Busta Rhymes, Jessica Simpson, LFO, The O'Jays, and Pink. The primetime hour of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve 2002\" was also preceded by \"ABC 2002\", a follow-up to the \"ABC 2000\" special, hosted by Peter Jennings from the Rose Center for Earth and Space. The two-hour special featured a \"meaningful and reflective\" view on New Year's celebrations from around the world, and also included performances by Arlo Guthrie, Sting, and U2. Clark personally felt that 2002, since it was the first in the wake of the September 11 attacks, was the most \"nerve-racking\" New Year's Eve he had ever experienced.\n\nOn December 8, 2004, it was reported that Clark had been hospitalized after suffering from a minor stroke. Despite Clark indicating his participation in \"New Year's Rockin' Eve 2005\" in a prepared statement, reports soon surfaced that the stroke may have been serious enough to prevent him from hosting at all. It was officially announced on December 14 that Dick Clark would not be hosting, and that Regis Philbin would fill in for Clark. In a statement, Clark said that he was thankful that Philbin was able to quickly step in on short notice to host the show, and hoped that he would do a good job. Philbin was optimistic about his role, considering it the \"best temp job ever.\"\n\nVarious personalities paid tribute to Clark throughout the night on New Year's Eve; the \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" broadcast featured special celebrity messages for Clark, and revelers in Times Square were seen with signs saluting Clark. During CNN's coverage, revelers in Times Square told CNN's Jason Carroll that Philbin was \"all right\" filling in for Clark (but still had Anderson Cooper and Carroll too). Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke with Philbin on Clark's absence during the show, noting that \"it isn't that we don't like Regis, but we want [Clark] back next year.\"\n\nPhilbin's hosting received mixed reviews: Richard Huff of the \"New York Daily News\" noted that Philbin's hosting was \"stiff\" at first, and suggested that he would have performed better if he had a co-host to interact with like his daytime talk show \"Live with Regis and Kelly\". In conclusion, he considered Philbin's performance to be \"suitable – although not spectacular.\" Virginia Heffernan of \"The New York Times\" believed that Philbin was feeling \"surprisingly nervous\" in his role at host, and felt that \"rowdy crowds\" (which Philbin chose to avoid by staying in the studio) and the success of Rod Stewart's career (which Philbin pounced on to promote his new album, \"When You're Smiling\") were bothering him.\n\nIn August 2005, ABC announced that Dick Clark would return to \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would be joined by a new co-host, media personality and \"American Idol\" host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing \"New Year's Eve Live\"—which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to \"USA Today\", Seacrest reminisced on having watched \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" in his childhood, stating that \"I knew when I was on other shows, I knew we weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve.\" As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with \"People Magazine\" in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.\n\nAlongside pre-recorded performances from Hollywood hosted by actress and pop singer Hilary Duff, the 2006 edition also featured a live performance by Mariah Carey directly inside Times Square – the first such performance in the show's history. Live performances from Times Square became a regular feature during future editions of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\".\n\nDuring the program, Clark made limited on-air appearances, but still conducted his traditional countdown, and also recollected on his recent experiences:\nPublic curiosity over Clark's condition and his return to television helped \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2006\" draw in over 20 million viewers throughout the night, and score a 7.1 audience share among the key demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds. Reaction to Clark's appearance was mixed. While some TV critics (including Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\", in an interview with the CBS Radio Network) felt he was not in good enough shape to do the broadcast, stroke survivors and many of Clark's fans praised the emcee for being a role model for people dealing with post-stroke recovery. \"The New York Times\"' Brian Stelter compared Seacrest's new role as co-host of \"Rockin' Eve\" to being like a \"traffic cop\", \"tossing to bands and correspondents and to Mr. Clark for the countdown.\" \n\nFollowing the 2006 edition, Dick Clark Productions announced that Seacrest had agreed to remain a host for future editions of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\". As he was still afflicted with speech impediments that resulted from dysarthria, a lingering effect of his stroke, Clark's role in the special was reduced; he continued to make limited on-air appearances from Times Square Studios as co-host near midnight, and still conducted his traditional countdown, but Seacrest hosted the majority of the program outside in Times Square itself.\n\nThe 2008 edition featured live performances from Times Square by Carrie Underwood, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers. Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas hosted concert segments from Hollywood, which also featured performances by Akon, Natasha Bedingfield, Sean Kingston, OneRepublic, Plain White T's, Taylor Swift and will.i.am. Seacrest's increased role as host was recognized beginning on the 2009 edition, as the special was officially renamed Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest. It featured live performances by the Jonas Brothers, Taylor Swift, and Lionel Richie, with Kellie Pickler serving as a correspondent. Hollywood segments featured performances by Fall Out Boy, Jesse McCartney, Natasha Bedingfield, Ne-Yo, The Pussycat Dolls, Solange, Robin Thicke and will.i.am.\n\nFor its 2010 edition, headlining performances in Times Square included Daughtry, and Jennifer Lopez (who infamously wore a dark-colored catsuit for her performance to mixed reviews), while Melissa Rycroft served as a correspondent. Fergie hosted concert segments on-location from Las Vegas, Nevada, featuring performances by her group The Black Eyed Peas, Colbie Caillat, Robin Thicke, Keri Hilson, Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, David Guetta, and Orianthi. \"American Idol\" season 8 runner-up Adam Lambert stated that he was also reportedly scheduled to perform, but dropped from both \"Rockin' Eve\" and a scheduled appearance on fellow ABC program \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in response to his controversial performance at the American Music Awards (which are also produced by Dick Clark Productions). Neither ABC nor Dick Clark Productions ever confirmed whether or not Lambert had been booked at all, however.\n\nThe 2011 edition featured live performances by Kesha, Taio Cruz and the supergroup NKOTBSB (the combined Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block), and actress Jenny McCarthy served as a reporter from Times Square. Fergie reprised her role as host for the pre-recorded Hollywood segments, which included performances by Avril Lavigne (which featured the world premiere of \"What the Hell\", the first single from her then-upcoming album \"Goodbye Lullaby\"), Natasha Bedingfield (who performed her latest single \"Strip Me\"), Jennifer Hudson, Ne-Yo, Train, Mike Posner, Willow Smith, Jason Derülo, Far East Movement, La Roux, Kesha, and Drake. Viewership for the 2011 edition peaked at around 19 million viewers.\n\nThe 2011–12 edition was once again hosted by Seacrest, with Clark co-hosting what would become his final appearance on the program. Fergie co-hosted for the sixth consecutive year for the pre-taped Hollywood segments, while Jenny McCarthy returned for her second year corresponding from Times Square. Musical guests in Times Square included Lady Gaga (who also joined Mayor Michael Bloomberg in activating the ball drop), Justin Bieber, Pitbull and Hot Chelle Rae. Performers in the Hollywood segments included Taio Cruz, Nicki Minaj, Blink-182, Florence and the Machine, LMFAO, Gym Class Heroes, OneRepublic (at Disneyland), The Band Perry, will.i.am, Christina Perri, and Robin Thicke. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first edition of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" aired in 1972, the primetime portion of the show was preceded by a two-hour retrospective special focusing on memorable music performances from the show's history.\n\n\"New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012\" brought ABC's highest ratings on New Year's Eve since \"ABC 2000 Today\"; an average 8.4 million viewers watched the retrospective segment, the primetime hour brought in 12.9 million viewers, and the first hour of the main broadcast peaked at 22.6 million viewers. These numbers excluded viewership from locations such as bars and New Year's Eve parties, as Nielsen ratings do not account for out-of-home viewership (however, the company announced on October 24, 2016 that it would begin to offer out-of-home ratings data to broadcasters in April 2017).\n\nOn April 18, 2012, Dick Clark died after suffering a heart attack following surgery to fix an enlarged prostate. Neither ABC or Dick Clark Productions immediately commented on the future of the program.\n\nIn August 2012, ABC confirmed via a press release that \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" would return for its 2012–13 edition. The primetime hour of this edition was preceded by a two-hour tribute special, \"New Year's Rockin' Eve Celebrates Dick Clark\". Clark's legacy was also recognized by the Times Square Alliance, organizers of the ball drop: a triangular Waterford Crystal panel engraved with Dick Clark's name was presented to his widow Kari Wigton, and installed on the ball.\n\nOn October 23, 2013, Dick Clark Productions confirmed the 2013–14 edition of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", and announced that Ryan Seacrest had signed a multi-year deal of unspecified length to continue serving as host and executive producer of the special. Seacrest stated that he would \"forever be both sentimental and grateful\" about his involvement in the special, and that he was \"excited to work together to create new traditions and fun moments on the show that only live television can deliver.\" Fellow producer Allen Shapiro credited Seacrest's involvement in \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" for its \"extended and expanded\" success. That year, the special was aired in simulcast in Canada for first time by City, replacing its coverage of concert festivities at Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square (City continued to sponsor the event, however). While viewership was down by 5%, \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" was still the highest-rated among the New Year's specials.\n\nOn February 7, 2014, ABC announced that it had renewed both \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" and the American Music Awards through 2023 and 2024 respectively. The 2016 edition featured One Direction's final U.S. television appearance before their planned hiatus. That year, \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" was once again the highest rated of the New Year's Eve specials across the major networks; for the late-night portion, while overall household viewership was down by 7%, ratings in the 18–49 demographic were up by 3%.\n\nThe 2017 edition expanded to feature coverage of New Year's Eve festivities in New Orleans hosted by Lucy Hale, with performances by Jason Derulo and Panic! at the Disco from the Sugar Bowl's Allstate Fan Fest concert, and Jackson Square's fleur-de-lis drop at midnight in the Central Time Zone. While household ratings for the late-night portion of the broadcast were down by 9% in comparison to 2016, \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" was once again the highest-rated New Year's special across the major networks, with a 9.0 rating in metered markets, and a 6.8 rating among adults 18–49.\n\nMariah Carey was one of the Times Square headliners for the 2017 edition. Her performance was notably marred by technical issues; when opening with \"Emotions\", Carey remarked throughout the song that she was unable to hear her backing track. On her second song, \"We Belong Together\", she briefly sang the song without incident, but abruptly stopped —revealing that she had been lip syncing. A representative of the singer claimed that Carey had alerted production staff that her in-ear monitors were not working, but that they refused to address the situation, and alleged that they were \"[setting] her up to fail.\" Dick Clark Productions denied any wrongdoing, stating that they \"had no involvement\" in the incident, and that the allegations by Carey's management that they had intentionally sabotaged her performance were \"defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.\"\n\nNew Jersey's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) had announced plans for a live performance from Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall by an unannounced artist, but these plans fell through, citing \"scheduling conflicts and other considerations\". The \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" reported that the CRDA's contract to host the DCP-produced Miss America pageant in Atlantic City contained provisions allowing \"promotional accommodations\" for the city in other DCP-produced programming, such as \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" and the \"Billboard Music Awards\". Robert Mulcahy, chairman of the board for the CRDA, explained that Live Nation (which was to fund the broadcast using cash left over from cancelled beach concerts) were unable to find an act that met the approval of DCP, and added that local casinos declined to fund the performance, as they preferred to host their own parties rather than book major acts.\n\nDespite the previous year's incident, Carey was subsequently invited to perform in Times Square again for \"New Year's Rockin' Eve 2018\", in what media outlets described as an attempt at \"redemption\". The 2018 edition saw major ratings gains, especially in primetime; the 8:00–10:00 p.m. primetime segment reached 10.5 million viewers with a 3.1/13 rating among 18-49s, and the 10:00 p.m. hour reached 15.7 million viewers and a 5.0/20 rating among 18-49s—the highest ratings to date for the 10:00 p.m. segment. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\"s only major competitor on network television for 2018 was \"Fox's New Year's Eve with Steve Harvey\", as NBC's Carson Daly-hosted special was placed on hiatus due to commitments to broadcast \"Sunday Night Football\" (however, the NFL ultimately forwent a primetime game that night, and NBC aired repeat programming instead).\n\nOn November 13, 2018, it was announced that YouTube Music would be a presenting sponsor of the 2019 edition. The service is also presenting sponsor of the DCP-produced American Music Awards. With the return of \"NBC's New Year's Eve\" after a hiatus, the 2019 edition experienced a decline in ratings to an 8.3 household share for its late-night portion, but was once again the top-rated among the New Year's specials.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, Jenny McCarthy stated on \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" that she would not appear as the Times Square correspondent for the 2020 edition of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", citing a desire to spend the holiday with her family, and her commitments to season 3 of Fox's \"The Masked Singer\" (where she serves as a celebrity panelist). Lucy Hale would serve as Times Square correspondent in place of McCarthy, and Billy Porter of the FX series \"Pose\" hosted the New Orleans segments in place of Hale, and also performed his song \"Love Yourself\". Ciara again hosted the Hollywood concert segments. The broadcast also included a promotional tie-in with the Powerball lottery, with Jessie James Decker revealing the \"first millionaire of 2020\" as part of a contest being held by the lottery.\n\n"}

In this disorder, the patient's kidneys fuse together to form a horseshoe-shape during development in the womb. The fused part is the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney. The abnormal anatomy can affect kidney drainage resulting increased frequency of kidney stones and urinary tract infections as well as increase risk of certain renal cancers.\n\nFusion abnormalities of the kidney can be categorized into two groups: horseshoe kidney and crossed fused ectopia. The 'horseshoe kidney' is the most common renal fusion anomaly.\n\nAlthough often asymptomatic, the most common presenting symptom of patients with a horseshoe kidney is abdominal or flank pain. However, presentation is often non-specific. Approximately a third of patients with horseshoe kidneys remain asymptomatic throughout their entire life with over 50% of patients having no medical issues related to their renal fusion when followed for a 25 year period. As a result, it is estimated that approximately 25% of patients with horseshoe kidneys are diagnosed incidentally with ultrasound or CT imaging.\n\nPatients with a horseshoe kidney can develop sequelae related to the abnormal anatomy and present with symptoms related to them. \n\nThe general categories a horseshoe kidney may increase the risk for fall under the following categories:\n\n\nThere have been several proposed factors that may contribute to the development of a horseshoe kidney. Different exposures to the developing fetus such as different teratogens (e.g. thalidomide, ethanol, ACE inhibitors, cocaine, gentamycin, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and vitamin A) have been hypothesized. Impairment of a developing embryo's nephrogenic cell migration or abnormal migration of the kidneys due to fetal structural abnormalities is another potential factor. However, no definitive genetic cause has been identified.\nKidneys are normally located in the retroperitoneal space between the T12 and L3 vertebrae after ascending from the pelvis during development to rest underneath the adrenal glands. In patients with this condition, the horseshoe kidney ascent is commonly arrested by the inferior mesenteric artery due to the central fusion of the kidneys. However, this is present in only 40% of cases, and, in 20% of cases, the fused kidney remains in the pelvis. Its ascension may also be restricted by its own renal artery. Additionally, during normal development, the kidneys undergo a 90 degree medial rotation while ascending. However, due to the renal fusion, this rotation is impaired resulting in abnormal placement of the ureters. This in turn can lead to urinary stasis and drainage issues. Furthermore, approximately 70% of kidneys in normal individuals are supplied by a single renal artery with the remaining 30% having embryonic collateral or accessory arteries. With horseshoe kidneys, the majority are supplied by derivatives of the abdominal aorta or common illiac arteries depending on the final position of the kidneys.\n\nHorseshoe kidneys are commonly diagnosed incidentally on abdominal imaging. The diagnosis can be made with many different imaging modalities such as ultrasound, intravenous pyelogram, CT, and MRI.\n\nCommon features that can be found on imaging include:\n\n\nSymphysiotomy, which involves separating the fused isthmus in order to release the kidneys, used to be a recommended treatment for this condition but has fallen out of favor due to complications and minimal benefit. Furthermore, kidneys can remain in their original abnormal location after the surgery. Instead, management focuses on treating the sequelae should the patient become symptomatic. \n\nWhile treatment typically does not differ from that of patients with normal kidney anatomy, kidney stones can warrant a different approach. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, a possible treatment for kidney stones, can be less effective in patients with horseshoe kidneys due to the abnormal anatomy causing difficulties with localizing the energy to the stones. Also, due to the kidney obstruction that can commonly occur with this renal fusion, clearance of the resulting stone fragments can also be impaired. For this reason, prior to any treatment with shockwave lithotripsy, a UPJ obstruction must first be ruled out as it significantly impair successful treatment. For stones that are less than 1.5 cm, ureteroscopy and shockwave lithotripsy can be first utilized. For stones larger than 1.5 cm or when previous treatment has failed, the stones can instead be removed through a minimally invasive procedure known as percutaneous nephrolithotomy. \n\nCompared to patients with normal kidneys, patients with horseshoe kidneys who undergo treatment with percutaneous nephrolithotomy experience no difference in complications or stone clearance.\n\nPatients will also typically require imaging before any abdominal surgery as the vascular supply to the abnormal kidney can be highly variable between patients. Additionally, the horseshoe kidneys can have a close association with colon which can increase risk of bowel injury.\n\nThere is an incidence of 1 in every 500 individuals within a normal population.\n\nMales are more likely to develop a horseshoe kidney with a preponderance of 2:1.\n\nCertain genetic diseases can predispose patients to developing a horseshoe kidney:\n\n\n"}

During World War II all missionaries left the area, and many mission stations, churches, schools and hospitals were damaged. In spite of this, the indigenous church leaders and local Christians stood firm in the work of the church. After the war the Lutheran churches in Australia and North America were asked to help reconstruct the church in Papua New Guinea, working together as the Lutheran Mission New Guinea. In 1956 expatriate missionaries and indigenous church leaders gathered and formed the present indigenous church. At the time of its founding the church was called Evangelical Lutheran Church of New Guinea (ELCONG), and its founding bishop was an expatriate missionary from the American Lutheran Church. The first indigenous bishop was elected in 1973. In 1975, on the eve of the country's independence, the name of the church was changed to Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea (ELCPNG). In 1977 the church was officially declared autonomous and another local Lutheran church organized by the Australian Lutheran Mission joined with the ELCPNG. It has long had close relations with the Gutnius Lutheran Church, largely in Enga Province, whose origins were American Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, and shares clergy college in Lae.\n\nThe ELCPNG believes that the church is the body of Christ on earth so that people can grow in faith and live as brothers and sisters. This function of the church is seen in the preaching of the gospel and the administration of the sacraments, bringing people closer to God so that they may inherit eternal life. The church teaches that the Holy Spirit enables and strengthens this work. The stated aims of the church are :\n\n\nThe church has seven departments: evangelism, education, lands and properties, ministerial training, medical services, development services, finance. There are 16 districts divided according to geographical and population needs. Circuits cover smaller areas within the districts; within the circuits are the local parishes/congregations. The church runs 12 health centres, 170 primary schools, six high schools, one teacher training college, a nursing college, five girls' Bible schools, three seminaries and a training centre for evangelists.\n\n\n"}

Dick. The short story was first published in \"Playboy\" in December 1980, under the title \"Frozen Journey\".\n\nIn the story, a man (Victor Kemmings) regains consciousness during a failed attempt at cryosleep on board a spaceship. The ship's artificial intelligence cannot repair the malfunction and cannot wake him, so Kemmings is doomed to remain conscious but paralyzed through the ship's entire ten-year-long journey. To maintain his sanity, the A.I. replays Kemmings's memories to him. But when this goes awry, the ship's A.I. asks Kemmings what he wants most -- and the answer is that Kemming wants the trip to be over and to arrive at his new home. The A.I. constructs such a scenario for Kemming and plays it to him over and over for the next ten years. When the ship finally arrives at its destination, Kemming cannot accept reality and believes his arrival to be yet another construction.\n\nLike most of Philip K. Dick's work, \"I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon\" involves a questioning of what it is to be human and of what reality is. The story also has a theme of guilt, as the memories of the passenger are spoiled by the guilt he retains about his past actions. \n"}

The district is bounded by four other districts (from north clockwise): Pathum Wan, Sathon, Khlong San (across the Chao Phraya River), and Samphanthawong. It was established in 1912. , Bang Rak's population was 47,817. Bang Rak was one of the first areas the westerners settled in Bangkok. Some of them were the Paris Foreign Missions Society who established the Catholic church Wat Suan Than (; now Assumption Cathedral (Bangkok)), American Presbyterian missionaries who founded the Bangkok Christian College, the embassy of France and Portugal in Thailand, and the East Asiatic (Thailand) Company who headquartered in the area. In 2016, the Thailand Creative and Design Centre (TCDC), relocating its headquarter from the former office in Khlong Toei to the Grand Postal Building in Bang Rak, has announced and promoted the Bang Rak's neighbourhoods surrounding the Charoen Krung Road as the creative district of Bangkok under the name \"Creative Charoen Krung\". The motto of the district iself reflects some traits of Bang Rak as; \"entertainment zone\" (i.e. Patpong, former Soi Pratuchai), \"luxurious hotel district\" (i.e. Dusit Thani, Sheraton, Mandarin Oriental), and \"education hub of famed schools\" (i.e. the long-standing private schools Assumption College, Bangkok Christian College, Saint Joseph Convent School). Moreover, Bang Rak is dotted with colonial and western architecture buildings; the former Customs House, the former East Asiatic Building, Neilson Hays Library, and the Bangkokian Museum. Asides from the historical significance, Bang Rak boasts a number of offices and some of the country's tallest skyscrapers; Mahanakhon, State Tower, and Jewelry Trade Center. The Si Lom neighbourhood is known for being one of the most valuable land in Thailand with estimated land cost of 0.425 million THB per square metre in 2016, ranking the third in Thailand behind the Siam neighbourhood and Chit Lom both in Khet Pathum Wan.\n\nBang Rak's history dates to the reigns of King Rama III, Rama IV, and Rama V after the conversion of a canal to Charoen Krung Road in 1862 and the construction of Yaowarat Road were completed. When Bangkok grew, many people, especially from Chinatown moved to live there. It is adjacent to the Talat Noi, one of the oldest Chinese communities in Bangkok. The area became a locus of Western businesses and diplomatic missions.\n\nThere are several theories about the district name, \"Bang Rak\":\n\n\nThe district is divided into five sub-districts (\"khwaeng\").\n\nBang Rak is known for its commercial area around Si Lom Road (also written Silom). The land properties on Si Lom Road are among the most expensive in Thailand with skyscrapers dotting the road.\nThe MahaNakhon Tower (312 m 1,030 ft with 77 floors) in Bang Rak, is now the tallest building in Thailand, overtaking Baiyoke Tower II. Other skyscrapers in Bang Rak include State Tower (247 m or 811 ft with 68 floors) on Si Lom Road while the nearby Jewelry Trade Center was once the tallest building in Thailand when it was completed in 1996. Dusit Thani Hotel, at the opposite end of Si Lom Road, contains a distinctive triangular shaped building, another landmark in the district. The hotel will be demolished in mid-2018 when the current lease expires and will be replaced with a new mixed-use project.\n\nMany shops targeting tourists appear along Si Lom Road, especially clothes, art, and jewellery stores. Much of the jewelry is produced in jewelry companies here. A few department stores are present in Bang Rak, namely, Silom Complex, Robinson Bang Rak. They are rather small compared to shopping centers in other areas. It is better known as a night shopping area for tourists. Along two sides of the Si Lom and in Patpong become night market full of stalls selling clothes and souvenirs. Furthermore, many pubs and go-go bars open in the nearby Patpong Road, a red-light district.\n\nOn the west side of Bang Rak is the Chao Phraya River. Several luxurious hotels are on the river bank: Oriental Hotel, Shangri-La Hotel, and Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel. Next to Royal Orchid Sheraton are Si Phraya express boat pier and River City Shopping Complex (actually in Samphanthawong), a shopping center specializing in antiques and arts.\n\nAlthough Buddhist temples in Bang Rak are not remarkable, with the possible exception of Wat Hua Lamphong (วัดหัวลำโพง) and maybe Wat Maha Phruettharam (วัดมหาพฤฒาราม), various places of worship representing other religions are well represented. This includes the Thailand's most famous Hindu temple named Sri Mahamariamman Temple. It is also called \"Wat Phra Sri Maha Umathewi\" (วัดพระศรีมหาอุมาเทวี)  or \"Wat Keak\" (วัดแขก) in Thai. A ceremony named Nawa Ratri (นวราตรี) or Dussehra is held by the temple during the first to the ninth day of the 11th lunar month (around October) when the temple statues were carried by the Hindu community along Si Lom Road. Some devotees perform rituals such as body piercing with sharp objects. Also in Bang Rak is the 210 year-old Assumption Cathedral, which has appeared in various films, as well as its school, Assumption College (Thailand).\n\nThe Bangkok Folk Museum (also called Bangkokian Museum) is also in the district as are The Neilson Hays Library, Bangkok's oldest English language library, and The British Club Bangkok, the last surviving international members' club. In 2017, the Thailand Creative and Design Centre (TCDC) moved to the Grand Postal Building.\n\n\nBang Rak is served by both Skytrain and Metro underground line. Most stops lie on district borders however due to its narrow roads. Skytrain stations include Sala Daeng, Chong Nonsi, Surasak, and Saphan Taksin with a new station Sueksa Witthaya planned, while Metro stops are Lumphini, Si Lom, Sam Yan, and Hua Lamphong.\n\nChao Phraya Express Boats also provide transportation service along the Chao Phraya River with the central pier at Sathorn Pier under the Taksin Bridge. Other piers for the boat service are Oriental, Wat Muang Kae, and Si Phraya.\n\n\n\n"}

Designed by Vernon Keenan, it opened to the public on June 26, 1927. The coaster is on a plot of land at the intersection of Surf Avenue and West 10th Street. The Cyclone reaches a maximum speed of and has a total track length of , with a maximum height of .\n\nThe coaster operated for more than four decades before it began to deteriorate, and by the early 1970s the city planned to scrap the ride. On June 18, 1975, Dewey and Jerome Albert, owners of the adjacent Astroland amusement park, entered into an agreement with New York City to operate the ride. The roller coaster was refurbished in the 1974 off-season, and reopened on July 3, 1975. Astroland Park continued to invest millions of dollars in the upkeep of the Cyclone. After Astroland closed in 2008, Cyclone Coasters president Carol Hill Albert continued to operate it under a lease agreement with the city. In 2011, Luna Park took over operation of the Cyclone.\n\nThe coaster was declared a New York City designated landmark on July 12, 1988, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 26, 1991.\n\nConey Island was the largest amusement area in the United States from about 1880 to World War II, attracting several million visitors per year. At its height, it contained three amusement parks (Luna Park, Dreamland, and Steeplechase Park) and many independent amusements. The Cyclone site was occupied by the Giant Racer from 1911 to 1926.\n\nThe success of 1925's Thunderbolt coaster and 1926's Tornado led Irving and Jack Rosenthal to buy land at the intersection of Surf Avenue and West 10th Street for a coaster of their own. With a $100,000 investment, they hired leading coaster designer Vernon Keenan to design a new ride. Harry C. Baker supervised the construction, which was done by area companies including the National Bridge Company (which supplied the steel) and Cross, Austin, & Ireland (which supplied the lumber). Its final cost was reportedly $146,000 to $175,000. When the Cyclone opened on June 26, 1927, a ride cost 25 cents (); the present-day ticket price is $10.\n\nIn 1935, the Rosenthals took over the management of New Jersey's Palisades Park. The Cyclone was placed under the supervision of Christopher Feucht, a Coney Island entrepreneur who had built a ride called Drop the Dip in 1907 and performed minor retracking work on the coaster. The ride's first drop was reduced by in 1939, and it continued to be extremely popular. A midget would originally zap disembarking riders with an electric paddle, a practice which ended during the 1950s.\n\nBy the 1960s, attendance at Coney Island had declined. Increased crime, insufficient parking, poor weather, and the post-World War II automotive boom were all cited as contributing factors in the decline. Coney Island's last remaining large theme park, Steeplechase Park, was closed in 1964 and subsequently demolished. The Cyclone was sold to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) in 1965.\n\nA new building housing the New York Aquarium had been constructed west of the Cyclone in 1954. New York City decided that an extension to the New York Aquarium would be a better use of the Cyclone property in 1967, and the city began procedures to claim the property by eminent domain. Its owners, East Coaster Corporation, unsuccessfully fought the city; they did minimal long-term maintenance, enough to keep the ride operating safely. The city bought the Cyclone for $1.2 million in 1969.\n\nThe Cyclone was then operated under contract by East Coaster Corporation while the city worked with the New York Aquarium on plans to redevelop the site. There was a lack of long-term maintenance by the city, and the coaster soon received 101 safety violations. In 1972, when plans to expand the aquarium were announced, a \"Save the Cyclone\" campaign began to oppose the proposed demolition of Coney Island's last wooden roller coaster. This created a conflict between the aquarium (which supported the Cyclone's demolition) and the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce, which opposed it. The owners of the AstroWorld theme park in Houston were considering buying the Coney Island Cyclone and moving it to Houston. This was eventually rejected as being too expensive, however, and AstroWorld's owners instead built the Texas Cyclone (a replica of the Coney Island Cyclone).\n\nBy 1974, city officials doubted their decision to purchase the Cyclone and considered leasing the coaster to a private operator. The proposed demolition of the Cyclone was seen as potentially disastrous to Coney Island's economy. The city changed its plans to dismantle the coaster and, in April 1975, invited sealed bids to lease operation of the ride. The owners of the Astroland amusement park won the lease, with a bid of $57,000 per year. After Astroland spent $60,000 to refurbish the Cyclone, the coaster reopened on July 3, 1975.\n\nDuring the 1986 season, insurance disputes forced the Cyclone to stay closed until July. The Cyclone remained in operation as a separate enterprise following the 2008 closure of Astroland and during the single operating season of Dreamland in 2009. The adjacent Luna Park took over management of the Cyclone in 2011, and began a major refurbishment of the coaster during the off-season. The refurbishment, by Great Coasters International, was completed in 2016.\n\nThe ride covers at 834 Surf Avenue and on West 10th Street, which is owned by NYC Parks. The former concession stands (built into the coaster's structure) were home to the Coney Island History Project, which was moved to a space near the Wonder Wheel. A souvenir stand selling Cyclone-based shirts, hats, and on-ride photos remains.\n\nEach ride in Luna Park charges a number of credits for admission, with each credit typically costing $1. , each ride on the Cyclone costs 10 credits ($10); free (or reduced-price) re-rides have been eliminated. Ride admission is also included in Luna Park's fixed-date and any-date passes. \"Bonus credits\" accumulated by the purchase of ride credits cannot be used for the coaster. The Cyclone is considered an \"irreplaceable\" structure, since timber-supported coasters can no longer be built under modern New York City building codes.\n\nThe train leaves the station heading north and immediately turns right at an almost 180-degree angle, which leads to an lift hill. It then moves over the first 58.1-degree drop; as the train reaches the bottom of the drop, it comes close to the track above for a headchopper effect. The train then ascends into the first high-speed U-turn to the left, descending again beneath the lift hill and rising to the second U-turn to the right. It descends parallel to the lift hill, enters a camelback hill and rises to a smaller banked right U-turn, where it dives under the first high-speed curve. After the third U-turn, the train enters a second camelback hill with a fan turn and a smaller airtime section as it approaches a fourth U-turn to the right. The train hops several times more, paralleling the second drop, before entering a final right curve. It drops slightly, ascends into a tunnel with a small left fan turn, and enters a brake run just before re-entering the station.\n\nThe track is long, including six fan turns and twelve drops. The ride's top speed is , and each ride takes about one minute and fifty seconds. The brown wooden track has red wood fencing alongside it and has a white structural framework, giving it a distinctive appearance. \"Cyclone\" appears in large, red, incandescent letters on the east and west sides of the lift hill. The coaster is surrounded by a fence.\n\nBefore 2000, the Cyclone's 58.1-degree initial drop was the third-steepest drop of any wooden coaster in the world. , it has the ninth-steepest drop of any wood coaster worldwide.\n\nThe Cyclone has three three-car trains, and one train can run at a time. Riders are arranged two across in four rows, for a total of 24 riders per train. The trains have bench seating (rather than individual seats for each passenger), and a single-position lap-bar restraint system which drops across the entire row. The seats do not have headrests.\n\nThe station is accessed from the ticket booth on West 10th Street. It consists of two wooden platforms, one on each side of the track; the outer (western) platform is for riders who are boarding, and the inner (eastern) platform is for exiting riders. The station is under a gable roof canopy supported by a steel arch frame, and has segmented arcades along its sides. A mechanical room is partly underneath, and next to, the platform. A vertical sign with incandescent letters spelling \"CYCLONE\" is outside the station.\n\nAt least three people have died after riding the Cyclone. On May 26, 1985, a 29-year-old man was killed when he stood up and hit his head on a crossbeam.\n\nOn August 23, 1988, a 26-year-old man was killed after falling from the coaster. The man, a maintenance worker, was the only passenger and was riding in the back seat during his lunch break. Apparently avoiding the safety bar, he was seen standing up as the train began its descent down the first hill. He fell , landed on a crossbeam of a lower section of track and died instantly. The ride was closed after the incident, but was reopened a day later after safety inspectors concluded that it was safe.\n\nA 53-year-old man suffered several crushed vertebrae in his neck while riding the Cyclone on July 31, 2007. He died four days later due to complications during surgery.\n\nOn June 12, 2008, a woman rode the Cyclone and later claimed that she had been seriously injured due to the ride. She was awarded $1.5 million in damages in 2015, despite being found partly at fault. In March 2018, a man claimed to have been struck by a metal bolt while waiting in the ride queue.\n\nThe Cyclone has been evacuated several times due to mechanical problems. On March 28, 2015, a mechanical failure caused a train to be stuck at the top of the lift hill; no one was injured. On June 13 of that year, a mechanical issue caused the ride to stop completely. The Cyclone stalled again on July 28, 2018, after it lost power.\n\nAviator Charles Lindbergh was said to have ridden the Cyclone two years after it opened, and reportedly called the experience \"greater than flying an airplane at top speed\". Emilio Franco, a mute coal miner with aphonia, visited Coney Island in 1948 and reportedly screamed while going down the Cyclone's first drop. Franco also reportedly said, \"I feel sick\" as his train returned to the station. According to multiple accounts, he fainted after realizing that he had spoken. \nAlthough one version of the story reported that Franco had been mute since birth, a contemporary \"New York Times\" story said that he had been mute for five years.\n\nMichael Boodley set a record in 1975 for the most consecutive trips on the Cyclone, riding it 1,001 times over a 45-hour period. Nineteen-year-old Richard Rodriguez broke the record from August 18 to 22, 1977, riding the coaster for 104 hours. He took short bathroom breaks between rides, eating hot dogs and M&Ms and drinking shakes during the ride itself. Rodriguez broke his own record for the longest roller-coaster marathon in 2007, riding for 405 hours and 40 minutes at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the United Kingdom. In 2009, Howie Lipstein was recognized by the Coney Island History Project as having ridden the Cyclone for fifty consecutive years.\n\nThe popularity of the Cyclone has inspired seven replica coasters that share (or mirror) a similar layout. Four replicas of the Cyclone were built at Six Flags parks: Viper at Six Flags Great America; Psyclone at Six Flags Magic Mountain; the Texas Cyclone at Six Flags AstroWorld; and the Georgia Cyclone at Six Flags Over Georgia. Of these, only Viper is still operational in its original state. International replicas include Bandit at Movie Park Germany; the defunct White Canyon at Yomiuriland in Japan, and the defunct Aska at Japan's Nara Dreamland.\n\nThe Cyclone was named a city landmark in 1988, and a National Historic Landmark in 1991. An ACE Coaster Classic and Coaster Landmark, it inspired the name of the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team, which plays at nearby MCU Park.\n\n"}

The reaction was first reported by Edmond Blaise (1872–1939) in 1901. The final intermediate is a metaloimine, which is then hydrolyzed to give the desired β-ketoester.\n\nBulky aliphatic esters tend to give higher yields. Steven Hannick and Yoshito Kishi have developed an improved procedure.\n\nIt has been noted that free hydroxyl groups can be tolerated in the course of this reaction, which is surprising for reactions of organometallic halides.\n\nThe mechanism of the Blaise reaction involves the formation of an organozinc complex with the bromine alpha to the ester carbonyl. This makes the alpha carbon nucleophilic, allowing it to attack the electrophilic carbon of the nitrile. The negative nitrile nitrogen resulting from this attack complexes with the zinc monobromide cation. The β-enamino ester (tautomer of the imine intermediate pictured above) product is revealed by work-up with 50% KCO aq.

Anderson\n\nMargaret Caroline Anderson (November 24, 1886 – October 19, 1973) was the American founder, editor and publisher of the art and literary magazine \"The Little Review\", which published a collection of modern American, English and Irish writers between 1914 and 1929. The periodical is most noted for introducing many prominent American and British writers of the 20th century, such as Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot in the United States, and publishing the first thirteen chapters of James Joyce's then-unpublished novel, \"Ulysses\".\n\nA large collection of her papers on Gurdjieff's teaching is now preserved at Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.\n\nAnderson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the eldest of three daughters of Arthur Aubrey Anderson and Jessie (Shortridge) Anderson. She graduated from high school in Anderson, Indiana, in 1903, and then entered a two-year junior preparatory class at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nIn 1906 she left college at the end of her freshman year to pursue a career as a pianist. In the fall of 1908 she left home for Chicago, where she reviewed books for a religious weekly (\"The Continent\") before joining \"The Dial\". By 1913 she was a book critic for the \"Chicago Evening Post\".\n\nIn March 1914, Anderson founded the avant-garde literary magazine \"The Little Review\" during Chicago's literary renaissance, which became not just influential, but soon created a unique place for itself and for her in the American literary and artistic history. \"An organ of two interests, art and good talk about art\", the monthly's first issue featured articles on Nietzsche, feminism and psychoanalysis. Early funding was intermittent, and for six months in 1914, she was forced out of her Chicago residence at 837 West Ainslie Street, and the magazine's offices at Chicago Fine Arts Building at 410 S. Michigan Avenue, and camped with family and staff members on the shores of Lake Michigan.\n\nThe writer Ben Hecht, who was at least partly in love with her then, described her this way:\nShe was blond, shapely, with lean ankles and a Scandinavian face. ... I forgave her her chastity because she was a genius. During the years I knew her she wore the same suit, a tailored affair in robin's egg blue. Despite this unvarying costume she was as chic as any of the girls who model today for the fashion magazines. ... It was surprising to see a coiffure so neat on a noggin so stormy.\nIn 1916, Anderson met Jane Heap, a spirited intellectual and artist immersed in the Chicago Arts and Crafts Movement, and a former lover to novelist Djuna Barnes. The two became lovers, and Anderson convinced her to become co-editor of \"The Little Review\". Heap maintained a low profile, signing her contributions simply \"jh\", but she had a major impact on the success of the journal through its bold and radical content.\n\nFor a while, Anderson and Heap published the magazine out of a ranch in Muir Woods, across the San Francisco Bay Area, before moving to New York's Greenwich Village in 1917. With the help of critic Ezra Pound, who acted as her foreign editor in London, \"The Little Review\" published some of the most influential new writers in the English language, including Hart Crane, T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Pound himself, and William Butler Yeats. The magazine's most published poet was New York dadaist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, with whom Heap became friends on the basis of their shared confrontational feminist and artistic agendas. Other notable contributors included Sherwood Anderson, André Breton, Jean Cocteau, Malcolm Cowley, Marcel Duchamp, Ford Madox Ford, Emma Goldman, Vachel Lindsay, Amy Lowell, Francis Picabia, Carl Sandburg, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, Arthur Waley, and William Carlos Williams. Even so, however, she once published an issue with a dozen blank pages to protest the temporary lack of exciting new works.\n\nIn 1918, starting with the March issue, \"The Little Review\" began serializing James Joyce's \"Ulysses\". Over time the U.S. Post Office seized and burned four issues of the magazine, and Anderson and her companion and associate editor, Jane Heap, were convicted of obscenity charges. Although the obscenity trial was ostensibly about \"Ulysses\", Irene Gammel argues that \"The Little Review\" came under attack for its overall subversive tone and, in particular, its publication of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven’s sexually explicit poetry and outspoken defense of Joyce. During the trial in February, 1921, hundreds of \"Greenwich Villagers\", men and women, marched into Special Court Sessions; eventually, Anderson and Heap were each fined $100 and fingerprinted.\n\nIn early 1924, through Alfred Richard Orage, Anderson came to know of spiritual teacher George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, and saw performances of his 'Sacred dances', first at the 'Neighbourhood Playhouse', and later at Carnegie Hall. Shortly after Gurdjieff's automobile accident, Anderson, along with Georgette Leblanc, Jane Heap and Monique Surrere, moved to France to visit him at Fountainebleau-Avon, where he had set up his institute at Château du Prieuré in Avon.\n\nAnderson and Heap adopted the two sons of Anderson's ailing sister, Lois. They brought Lois and sons Tom and Arthur ‘Fritz’ Peters to Prieuré in June 1924, After they returned to New York in 1925, two of the boys were taken in by Alice B. Toklas and Gertrude Stein.\n\nLater, Anderson moved to Le Cannet on the French Riviera, to live in \"le phare de Tancarville\" for many years with the French singer Georgette Leblanc and Lois and her daughter Linda Card.\n\nThe final issue of \"The Little Review\" was edited at Hotel St. Germain-Des-Pres, 36 rue Bonaparte, Paris.\n\nAnderson published a three-volume autobiography: \"My Thirty Years' War\" (1930), \"The Fiery Fountains\", and \"The Strange Necessity\" in her last years in Le Cannet. There she wrote her final book, the novel and memoir, \"Forbidden Fires\".\n\nThe teachings of George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff played an important role in Anderson's life. Anderson met Gurdjieff in Paris and, together with Leblanc, began studies with him, focusing on his original teaching called The Fourth Way. From 1935 to 1939, Anderson and Georgette Leblanc studied with Gurdjieff as part of a group of women known as \"The Rope\", which included eight members in all: Jane Heap, Elizabeth Gordon, Solita Solano, Kathryn Hulme, Louise Davidson and Alice Rohrer, besides them. Along with Katherine Mansfield and Jane Heap, she remains one of the most noted institutees of Gurdjieff's, Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man, at Fontainebleau, near Paris, from October 1922 to 1924.\n\nAnderson studied with Gurdjieff in France until his death in October 1949, writing about him and his teachings in most of her books, most extensively in her memoir, \"The Unknowable Gurdjieff\".\n\nBy 1942 her relationship with Heap had cooled, and, evacuating from the war in France, Anderson sailed for the United States. Jane Heap had moved to London in 1935, where she led Gurdjieff study groups until her death in 1964. With her passage paid by Ernest Hemingway, Anderson met on the voyage Dorothy Caruso, widow of the singer and famous tenor Enrico Caruso. The two began a romantic relationship, and lived together until Dorothy's death in 1955. Anderson returned to Le Cannet, and there she died of emphysema on October 19, 1973. She is buried beside Georgette Leblanc in the Notre Dame des Anges Cemetery.\n\nAnderson was the subject of an Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject nominated documentary entitled, \"\" in 1991, by Wendy L. Weinberg.\n\nCelebrating the life and work of Margaret Anderson and the Little Review's remarkable influence, an exhibition \"Making No Compromise: Margaret Anderson and the Little Review\" was opened at the Beinecke Library, Yale University, from October, 2006, and ran for three months.\n\nIn 2006 Anderson and Jane Heap were inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2014, Anderson was inducted into The Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2031476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031476", "title": "Giovanni Gronchi", "text": "Giovanni Gronchi\n\nGiovanni Gronchi (; 10 September 1887 – 17 October 1978) was a Christian Democratic Italian politician who served as the third President of Italy from 1955 to 1962 and was marked by a controversial and failed attempt to bring about an \"opening to the left\" in Italian politics.\nHe was reputed the real holder of the executive power in Italy from 1955 to 1962, backward the various Prime Ministers of this time.\n\nHe was born at Pontedera, Tuscany, and was an early member of the Christian Movement founded by the Catholic priest don Romolo Murri in 1902. He obtained his first degree in literature and philosophy at the \"Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa\". Between 1911 and 1915 he then worked as a high-school teacher of classics in several Italian towns (Parma, Massa di Carrara, Bergamo and Monza).\n\nHe volunteered for military service in the First World War and when it was over he became in 1919 one of the founding members of the Catholic Italian Popular Party. He was elected to represent Pisa in both the parliamentary elections of 1919 and 1921. A trade-union leader in the Italian Confederation of Christian Workers, in 1922–1923 he served in the first government of Benito Mussolini as Under-secretary for Industry and Commerce. In April 1923, however, a national meeting of the Popular Party held in Turin decided to withdraw all PPI representatives from the government. He then went back to his role in the leadership of the Catholic trade unions, and tried to face the daily violence brought against them by the fascist squads.\n\nIn 1924, after Luigi Sturzo had resigned as Secretary of the PPI, Gronchi became leader of the party, together with two other \"triumvirs\", (Spataro and Rodinò). Re-elected to Parliament in the same year, he joined the anti-fascist opposition of the so-called Aventine Secession (from the hill in Rome where the opposition withdrew from Parliament). In 1926 he was expelled from Parliament by the new regime.\n\nIn the years between 1925 and 1943 he thus interrupted his political career. In order to avoid having to become a member of the Fascist Party, he also resigned his position as a schoolteacher, and earned his living as a successful businessman, first as a salesman and then as an industrialist.\n\nIn 1943–1944 he was a co-founder of the new Christian-Democratic party (DC), and became a leader of its left-wing faction, together with men like Giorgio La Pira, Giuseppe Dossetti and Enrico Mattei (the future boss of ENI, the Italian government-owned petrochemical giant). He was also a member of the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale, the multi-party committee of the Italian Resistance, as a representative of his party.\n\nAlthough often in conflict with his party’s majority and its Secretary Alcide De Gasperi, he served as Industry minister in 1944–1946 and as a member of the Constituent Assembly in 1946. In 1947, as the Cold War began, he vehemently opposed his party’s decision to expel the Italian Communist and Socialist parties from the national government. From 1948 to 1955 he was elected President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies (the lower branch of Parliament).\n\nIn 1955 Luigi Einaudi’s term as first President of the Italian Republic came to an end, and Parliament had to choose his successor. The new Secretary of the DC, Amintore Fanfani, was promoting for the job the liberal Cesare Merzagora, who was then President of the Senate. However the extreme right-wing of the party – led by Giuseppe Pella, Guido Gonella, Salvatore Scoca and Giulio Andreotti – joined hands with the trade-unionist left – led by Giovanni Pastore, Giorgio Bo and Achille Marazza – in an \"uprising\" against the party leadership, in order to get Giovanni Gronchi (\"Parliament's man\") elected instead. The move had the support of the Communist and Socialist parties, and also of the monarchic and neo-fascist right. After a bitter battle and the final crumbling of the centrist front, on 29 April 1955 Gronchi was elected President of the Republic with 658 votes out of 883. He was the first Catholic politician to become Head of the Italian State.\n\nHis period in office lasted until 1962. It was marked by the ambition to bring about a gradual “opening to the left”, whereby the Socialists and the Communist Party would be brought back into the national government, and Italy would abandon NATO, becoming a non-aligned country. There was however stiff parliamentary opposition to this project, particularly by the small Italian Liberal Party, which was deemed a necessary ingredient of any viable majority.\n\nIn an attempt to escape the deadlock, in 1959 Gronchi appointed as prime minister a trusted member of his own Catholic left-wing faction, Fernando Tambroni, sending him to Parliament with a “President’s government” but no pre-arranged majority. However Tambroni found himself surviving in Parliament only thanks to neo-fascist votes. This unforeseen “opening to the right” had serious consequences. In 1960 there were bad riots in several towns of Italy, particularly at Genoa, Licata and Reggio Emilia, where the police opened fire on demonstrators, killing five people. The Tambroni government thus ended in ignominy; forced to resign, it was followed by an all-DC government, with a traditionally centrist parliamentary majority.\n\nThe unhappy Tambroni experiment tarnished Gronchi’s reputation for good, and until the end of his period of office he remained a lame-duck President. In 1962 he attempted to get a second mandate, with the powerful help of Enrico Mattei, but the attempt failed and Antonio Segni was elected instead. As he ceased to be Head of State, he became a life senator by right, according to the Italian Constitution. He died in Rome on 17 October 1978 at the age of 91.\n\nFor an overall historical assessment of his presidency it must certainly kept in mind the Tambroni failure, with its suggestion of an authoritarian approach. Yet an “opening to the left” of sorts did in fact happen soon after his mandate was over. Indeed, the first center-left coalition was formed by Aldo Moro as soon as 1964, when the Socialists (but not the Communists) entered the government. In the 1970s, the Christian Democrats and Communists made efforts toward what was called the Historic Compromise. On this basis he might be credited with some important foresight and a lasting influence.\n\nStill, it is hard to maintain that his political project had really very much to do with the center-left governments that followed each other between 1964 and 1992. During most of this period the Communists were isolated even more tightly than before, due to the loss of their former Socialist allies and the bitter conflict that followed with them, particularly after Bettino Craxi became the Socialist leader. Outside influences were later revealed to be at work as well. A 2000 Parliament Commission report concluded that the strategy and operations by the clandestine, US-supported, \"stay-behind\" Gladio was designed to \"stop the PCI, and to a certain degree also the PSI [Italian Socialist Party], from achieving executive power in the country\". In any case, Italy kept its socio-economic structure as a market economy and its foreign policy alignment.\n\nIn 1941, Gronchi married Carla Bissatini (2 September 1912 – 14 August 1993) and had one son and one daughter.\n\n\n\n"}

Also known as trade loading, this can be the result of a company attempting to inflate its sales figures. Alternatively, it can be a consequence of a poorly managed sales force attempting to meet short term objectives and quotas in a way that is detrimental to a company in the long term.\n\nChannel stuffing has a number of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any unsold goods to the company, incurring a carrying cost and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with this excess inventory, leads to costly overtimes and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as sales works to make up for prior overselling. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish gray market channels as salespeople no longer adequately qualify their prospects. \n\nOccasionally, distribution channels such as large retailers have been known to identify the practice of channel stuffing in their suppliers, and use the phenomenon to their advantage. This is done by holding back on orders until the end of the suppliers' quota period. The supplier's sales force then panics, and sells a large amount of the product under more favorable terms than they would under ordinary circumstances. At the beginning of the next period, no new orders are placed, and, barring any action, the cycle is then repeated. This affects customers, with gluts and shortages as buyers turn to competing products. \n\nCorporations have been known to engage in channel stuffing and hide such activities from their investors. In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in some cases litigated against such corporations, and private class-action suits have been engaged. Channel stuffing might also be part of a broader set of financial improprieties.\n"}

Two years after that, in 1998, they joined a small company SANTACLAUS in producing the Sega ST-V powered arcade game \"Astra Superstars\".\n\nThe arcade version of \"Galaxy Fight\" uses 32 4-megabyte ROM chips.\n\nIn 2017 the game was re-released under the Arcade Archives, developed by Hamster Corporation for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, followed by a Nintendo Switch version a week later.\n\nThough \"Galaxy Fight\" is similar to Sunsoft's later game \"Waku Waku 7\" (which uses the same engine), the games have few elements in common (one of them being the mid-boss, Bonus-Kun). The players choose one of eight characters and travel among the in-game solar system to defeat the opponents inhabiting each of the planets before they get the chance to fight Felden and settle their personal scores with him.\n\nThe game uses a four-button layout where the first three buttons are used for non-specified striking attacks (they can be anything ranging from punches and kicks to tail whips and bites) with each specific button yielding different strengths of attacks. The fourth button is used specifically for taunts which has no practical impact. Combining several buttons together may yield new attacks or special moves depending on the character.\n\nThere are no walls in the stages to corner players; instead, the screen can scroll indefinitely.\n\n\n\"Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors\" was later ported to the Neo-Geo AES home console, which includes easy-to-access difficulty settings and limited credits.

This version was later ported to the Sega Saturn and released worldwide. Later, a Sony PlayStation port was released in Japan and Europe. In 2008, the Neo-Geo CD version of \"Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors\" was included with the Neo-Geo AES version of Sunsoft's other fighting game \"Waku Waku 7\" in Vol.11 of the Neo Geo Online Collection series for the Sony PlayStation 2, titled . While the Neo-Geo CD soundtrack of \"Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors\" was added in this version, the soundtrack of \"Waku Waku 7\" is completely different from the unreleased Neo-Geo CD version that was later ported to the Sega Saturn. SNK was unable to add the Neo-Geo CD / Sega Saturn version of the soundtrack because of licensing issues. The Neo-Geo AES home console version of \"Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors\" was later ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan by D4 Enterprise on March 23, 2010 and on the Nintendo Switch eShop worldwide on May 18, 2017.\n\nA soundtrack album of the Neo-Geo version was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron Label on March 17, 1995 exclusively in Japan under the catalog number PCCB-00177. It contains nearly every background music, as well as sound effects and voice samples from the arcade version. It was composed by Masato Araikawa and Takayuki Sasaki, and performed by Jun Kojime.\n\n\"GamePro\" gave the Neo Geo version a positive review. They complimented the graphics, music, and the way each attack is suited to its particular character, but added that the game lacks the originality and polish to reach true greatness, concluding that \"\"Galaxy Fight\" will definitely whet the appetite of fighters everywhere. But it doesn't provide the Big Bang needed to unseat Mortal or Killer in the arcades.\"\n\nThe Saturn version was largely ignored by the gaming press, but a brief review appeared in \"Next Generation\" several months after the game's release. It assessed that the game \"looks and plays like an average Neo-Geo fighter,\" and scored it two out of five stars.\n\n\n"}

It is about 4 miles to the south west of Preston. The population of the civil parish, which also includes the village of New Longton, was 5,500 at the 2001 Census increasing to 7,652 at the 2011 Census.\n\nLongton is a village of ancient origin. The parish church, St. Andrew's was completed in 1887 when the previous chapel of 1772 which stood nearer the main road was demolished. This stood on the site of an earlier chapel, the records of which are lost.\n\nAlthough a document refers to \"Eafward Priest of Longton\" as early as 1153, and there is evidence of a chapel in Longton just before the reformation in 1517, when William Walton endowed a chantry at the chapel, there is no evidence that it stood on or near the site of the present parish church. No archaeological evidence has ever been found on the current site, and the dedication of the early chapel is unknown.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Longton was known as \"a sort of Holy Land\" because the monks of Penwortham Priory tended their lands here. It was no doubt the monks who established the first chapel here. Many mediaeval documents survive which are mostly concerning rents paid to the Shireburn Family of Stonyhurst. An old source mentions a meadow called \"Tirolkar\" which bears a remarkable resemblance to the \"Hallcar\" of today.\n\nThe parish was part of Preston Rural District throughout its existence from 1894 to 1974. In 1974 the parish became part of South Ribble.\n\nApart from St. Andrew's Church, the Anglican church on Liverpool Road, there is a Methodist Chapel called Longton Methodist Church and the Catholic church of St. Oswald on Chapel Lane.\n\nA small, plain Wesleyan chapel was built in Marsh Lane in 1807 and enlarged in 1833. In 1872 a new chapel was built in the Early English style.\n\nBy 1837 the primitive Methodists had become so numerous that they opened a chapel down Chapel Lane, but as time went on they declined and the Chapel was converted into a small housing estate.\n\nDespite the successful application for a licence to build a Congregational Chapel in 1821, it never got built.\n\nSt. Oswald's Catholic Church was established in 1893 and on 16 October 1894 a chapel and school was opened, entirely funded by the wealthy Liverpool priest, Canon Lennon. By 1965, the congregation had vastly increased and a new church was built on an adjacent site.\n\n\"Longton Brickcroft\" is a former brickworks which has been transformed into a nature reserve and public open space. It was declared a Local Nature Reserve by South Ribble Borough Council in 1998. The environment has been made extremely attractive, dominated by water which has filled the former clay pits. One of the water areas is available for fishing. The areas surrounding the water have been allowed to develop naturally with trees, shrubbery and wild plants.\n\nThe Brickcroft is of particular interest to birdwatchers and botanists with seating and footpaths making it accessible for most visitors.\nA purpose built visitor centre contains informative displays on the site's history, local wildlife and the environment. Facilities include toilets with disabled and baby changing provision, car parking and a picnic area.\n\nThe long distance footpath the Ribble Way starts by The Dolphin Inn in Longton.\n\nA small UKWMO nuclear observation bunker can be found to the north-west of the village on Back Lane. Its position is concealed as it is located on a private field, and as such it is relatively unknown among villagers.\n\nMost houses in Longton are semi-detached, detached, bungalows or homes that are part of modern housing estates. About 70% of accommodation in Longton was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but more modern developments have been constructed.\n\nThere is only one area of council housing in the village; it is in West and East Square and it is well maintained.\n\nLongton is home to two primary schools. There is a Catholic school on Chapel Lane called St. Oswald's. The majority of children in the village go to Longton Primary School in School Lane.\n\nMost students from the village, after primary school go to the surrounding high schools. These include Hutton Grammar School, Penwortham Girls' High School, All Hallows Catholic High School and Penwortham Priory Academy. Tarleton High School also takes in a few people each term also, as does Bolton School and Kirkham Grammar School.\n\nLongton has a Scouts division, a small building across from Booths on Liverpool Road, next to St. Andrew's Church Hall. It has all 3 major stages, from Beavers to Cubs to Scouts. The neckerchief colours are blue and white. Longton also has a Girl Scouts division. Based in the Church Hall, it has 2 of the major stages: Brownies and Guides.\n\n\"Longton Marshes\" are a large area of marshland to the west of Longton lying at the confluence of the Rivers Douglas and Ribble which is now part of the Ribble Link. It is the natural home for a large variety of visiting and indigenous wildfowl. The 70 mile Ribble Way footpath starts at the Dolphin Inn, once owned by the Holmes family, on the edge of the marsh and follows its edge before joining the Ribble.\n\nIn 1882 the West Lancashire Railway came to the village. Longton Bridge railway station was aimed at opening the village up to the local economic hubs of Preston and Southport, but the placement of the station in relation to the village was too far. The line closed in 1964. While some of the line's earth bankings and bridge foundations are still visible on Liverpool Road, much of the track has been built over.\n\nThe A59 road passes to the east of the village and is known as \"Longton Bypass\". On the A59 there is a bridge over a road that connects Longton to New Longton. This bridge was originally constructed to take the Longton Bypass over the railway line between Preston and Southport, and was adapted to road use after the line's closure. The central reservation on the A59 dual carriageway was then made continuous to prevent traffic from crossing four lanes of fast-moving traffic. The poor visibility to the south, because of the alignment necessary to take the highway over the railway bridge, had made crossing the A59 very dangerous at this location.\n\nBus services in Longton are provided by Stagecoach North West, with regular services operating to Preston City Centre and Southport or Ormskirk. Preston Bus also operates a half hourly service linking the village with New Longton, Lower Penwortham and Preston City Centre.\n\nThe following is a list of notable people from Longton:\n\n\n\n"}

In ancient times its proximity to the Red Sea made it an important trading emporium between India, Punt, Felix Arabia and the North.It was important for nearby gold and quartzite mines in the Eastern Desert, and as a starting point for expeditions to Punt (in modern Somalia).\n\nIn ancient Egypt, Qift, known then as Gebtu, was an important center for administration, religion, and commerce, being the chief city of the fifth Upper Egyptian nome of Harawî (Two Hawks). From Qift and Qus, trading expeditions heading for the Red Sea and many mining expeditions into the Eastern Desert left the Nile Valley. Gebtu was at the starting-point of the two great caravan routes leading to the coast of the Red Sea, the one toward the port Tââou (Myoshormos or Myos Hormos), the other more southerly, toward the port of Shashirît (Berenice).\nUnder the native pharaohs, the whole trade of southern Egypt with the Red Sea passed over these two roads; under the Ptolemies as well as in Roman and Byzantine times, merchants followed the same roads for purposes of barter at the coasts of Zanzibar and in Southern Arabia, India, and the Far East.\n\nGebtu was the most important religious center in the area. Its principal male deity was Min, a sky-god whose symbol was a thunderbolt. He became a male fertility deity, , and also was regarded as the male deity of the desert region to the east.\n\nHis cult rose to prominence in the Middle Kingdom. At that time, he became associated with Horus as the deity, Min-Horus. Later, he was fused with Amen in the deity Min-Amen-ka-Mut-ef, as \"Min-Amen-bull of his mother\" (Hathor-Isis).\nIsis (Hathor-Isis) and her infant, Horus, were the deities connected with Gebtu, named Coptos during the Greco-Roman period, probably due to the reinterpretation of the Two Hawks of the Nome, Harawî, standard as Min and Horus.\nGebtu, once politically important, especially under the Eleventh Dynasty, was overshadowed by Thebes.\n\nThe town was of importance in Hellenistic times, when it was the terminus of a caravan route to Berenice on the Red Sea. It was built up by Augustus, fell to the Blemmyes in the 3rd cent. AD, and was almost destroyed by Diocletian in AD 292.\n\nIt recuperated its prominence under the Antonines; it was the base camp of Legio III \"Cyrenaica\", or at least one of its subunits. It rebelled, but soon was captured in 292 by Valerius Diocletianus after a long siege and the original city got heavily damaged. It was then reconstructed as a Roman City with many fortifications and Roman camps. In the 6th century, Qift was renamed Justinianopolis, like several other cities, after the Byzantine emperor Justinian I. The present-day village of Qift is on the site.\n\nUnder the caliphs and the sultans in the Islamic era Qift was a chief city of Upper Egypt and a Shi'ite waqf of the Ashraf Alids. In the 12th/13th century the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi wrote of Qift's commerce with India and its surrounding orchards. Several generations of qadi high-officials of the Ayubids derived their family \"nisba\" (surname), 'Al-Qifti', from the territory. The celebrated biographer al-Qifti, was born here in 1172, where he received an early education.\nIn 1176, a Christian revolt against the rule of Al-Adil I, the brother of Saladin who managed to forcefully convert the masses. In the 13th century, numerous monasteries continued in operation around the city. However when the Ottomans who ruled over Egypt leveled much of the medieval town in the 16th century its former significance was never regained and by the early 20th century its population stood at just 8934.\n\nRemains of three temple groups surrounded by an enclosure wall were located during the excavations of W. M. Flinders Petrie in 1893-1894, and later, by Raymond Weill and Adolphe Joseph Reinach in 1910–1911. Qift was the focus of an American archaeological project from 1987 to 1992 and an Australian one between 2000 and 2003.\n\nThe undecorated northern temple of Min and Isis dates to the Ptolemaic period. Earlier structures on the site date back to the Middle Kingdom, with significant work during the New Kingdom reign of Tuthmosis III. The temple was rebuilt during the Ptolemaic Period. The later work has been attributed to an official named Sennuu-shepsi on behalf of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (ruling from 281 BC to 246 BC).\nThis northern temple has some later additions by Ptolemy IV Philopator ruling from 221–205 BC. He was the son of Ptolemy III and Berenice II of Egypt and was the fourth pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Egypt, when the decline of the Ptolemaic kingdom began. More additions were added by Julio-Claudian emperors of Rome, Caligula, and Nero.\nThe second pylon still carries the dedication text of Nero, and the cartouche of Caligula appears on the north end of this structure.\nIn the court of the temple a headdress of a statue of Arsinoe II, the wife of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, was found. A chapel from the Saite period stands in the court. The remains of this chapel of Osiris, erected by Amasis II of the 26th Dynasty, also were found near the northern temple. It was built by Ahmose-si-Neith. Scenes on the facade of the temple show the deified king Ptolemy I Soter leaving a palace, while other items such as a triad and a stela date to the time of Ramesses II.\n\nThis temple stands on the site of earlier Ancient Egyptian temple structures. Foundation deposits point to a temple of Thutmose III of the 18th Dynasty. Another temple belonged to Amenemhat I and his son, Senusret I, both of the 12th Dynasty. Senusret I is shown receiving life from Bubastis and Nekhbet. Within this temple a decree from the 17th Dynasty ruler Nubkheperre Intef was found by the East doorway. The decree describes how Nubkheperre Intef deposed a man named Teti.\n\nThe middle temple dates back to the time of Thutmose III of the 18th Dynasty. The temple was later rebuilt by Ptolemy II Philadelphus and restored by the Roman emperor Claudius.\nAt the site of the later middle temple built during the Ptolemaic kingdom, blocks of an earlier structure by Senusret I and a gate of Thutmose III, with additions probably made by Osorkon II of the 22nd Dynasty, were found. This later middle temple was built during the Ptolemaic kingdom by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, with minor additions by members of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty of Rome, Caligula, Claudius, and Trajan.\nThe foundations contained objects from the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period. Stelae were found depicting Pepi I and his mother Queen Iput before the god Min, two decrees and fragments of others by Pepi II. A First Intermediate Period decree regarding offerings to a statue of Pepi II was found. The stele mentions the overseer of the prophets named Idi. Three decrees of Neferkauhor, two of which were addressed to a Vizier and are now in the Cairo Museum.\n\nThe southern temple was likely dedicated to Geb\nAt the site of the southern temple, are the gates of Nectanebo II of the 30th Dynasty, who was the last native king of Egypt. He was placed on the throne by a Spartan king and lost a conflict with the Persians, who then overtook Egypt.\nOther structures found at the site include a set of stelae, now known as the Coptos Decrees. These stelae date to the Sixth and Seventh dynasties, with copies of royal decrees from the pharaohs concerning the temple and its personnel. The name by which the stelae are known reflects the much later Greek name for the city, Coptos or Koptos however.\nA chapel of Ptolemaic dynasty pharaoh Cleopatra VII and her son, Ptolemy XV Caesarion, has been found at the site as well. These rulers of Ancient Egypt for six hundred years were not native, but of Macedonian Greek origin (the Macedonians had begun the merging of Greek and Near Eastern culture known as the Hellenistic Culture under Alexander the Great). Without many changes, however, they adopted the culture and religious practices of the country they occupied. Cleopatra even learned the ancient Egyptian language, which never had been used by these rulers. The Greeks sought to find parallels to their own religious beliefs and would describe the Egyptian deities as related to their own.\nBuilt even later, after the conquest by the Romans in 30 AD, gates associated with the Roman emperors Caligula and Claudius are documented at the site. The Romans also continued the religious traditions of Ancient Egypt, adopting some completely, and drawing parallels (similar to the Greek rulers) for others.\n\nNortheast of Qift, at the modern village of El-Qala, the Roman emperor Claudius also built a small temple and dedicated it to Min, Isis, and Horus. The Horus name of the Roman emperor Tiberius (emperor 14–37 A.D.) is shown on two columns in the sanctuary. In the same sanctuary Claudius is shown before Isis. In the south chapel the emperor offers to Hathor, while on the exterior he is shown offering to the united emblems of Upper and Lower Egypt.\n\nThe Christian city was still important enough to become a bishopric, suffragan of Ptolemais in the Late Roman province Thebais Secunda. Five bishops are known (Le Quien, II, 607): Theodorus, a partisan of Meletius; Phoebammon in 431; Sabinus in 451; Vincent, author of the \"Canonical Solutions\", preserved in an Arabic translation and highly esteemed by the Copts; Moyses, who wrote the panegyric of Vincent.\n\nIt faded under Islamic rule, no later than the Ottoman ruin of the city.\n\nThe diocese was nominally restored as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric, initially under the name Coptos, which was changed in 1925 to Coptus.\nIt is vacant since decades, having had the following incumbents, both of the lowest (episcopal) rank:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2031535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031535", "title": "The Dirty Boogie", "text": "The Dirty Boogie\n\nThe Dirty Boogie is the third album from the swing band The Brian Setzer Orchestra. The album is considered as the breakthrough for the band, with their first single being a cover of Louis Prima's \"Jump Jive an' Wail\", which Prima had made popular in 1956 and included in his album \"The Wildest!\". The release of the single came along after a Gap advertising campaign that featured Prima's original recording of the song. Each helped to propel the larger swing revival throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. Seven of the album's tracks are covers of songs written and originally made popular between 1952 and 1962.\n\nIn addition to Prima's \"Jump Jive An' Wail\", covers include \"This Old House\" (Stuart Hamblen, 1954); \"Since I Don't Have You\" (The Skyliners, 1959); \"Nosey Joe\" (recorded by Bull Moose Jackson, written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, 1952); and \"As Long As I'm Singin'\" (Bobby Darin, 1962). \"You're the Boss\", also penned by Leiber and Stoller in 1961, is the album's seventh track, a duet featuring singer (and labelmate) Gwen Stefani; an earlier popular recording of the tune paired Elvis Presley and Ann-Margret. The eighth track, \"Rock This Town\", is a song originally done in 1981 by Setzer's previous band, the Stray Cats. \"Hollywood Nocturne\" was a discarded track from Setzer's previous album, \"Guitar Slinger\".\n\nThe album also features a cover of the instrumental \"Sleep Walk\", made popular originally by songwriters and performers Santo & Johnny Farina in 1959. Setzer's arrangement and recording won a Grammy Award the following year for best pop instrumental recording.\n\nPaul Brandt later did a cover of the album's fourth track, \"Let's Live It Up\".\n\nThe illustration and logo for \"The Dirty Boogie\" was created by Sir Richard Wentworth, using techniques such as pen and ink linework and cut rubylith sheets. The album cover began life as a show poster designed by Wentworth to advertise a Brian Setzer Orchestra concert at Detroit's State Theater (currently The Fillmore Detroit). After Brian Setzer saw the poster, he commissioned Wentworth to reformat the poster and to create a new logo for the band. The angular, kinetic style employed in Wentworth's illustration sparked a trend of identifying the music of the swing revival with the visual signifiers of the cartoon modern style (a type of dynamic, minimal design commonly used in 1950s and 1960s limited animation). Wentworth's retro logotype is still an essential part of the Brian Setzer Orchestra's brand identity and has inspired a commercial font called \"Swinger\". Wentworth also illustrated the covers for Setzer's \"Best of The Big Band\" (Japan Only CD), \"Boogie Woogie Christmas\" and \"Christmas Rocks!\" CDs, and designed the logo for \"The Ultimate Christmas Collection\" CD.\n\n\n"}

It was founded as the Darfur Liberation Front by members of three indigenous ethnic groups in Darfur: the Fur, the Zaghawa, and the Masalit, among whom were the leaders Abdul Wahid al Nur of the Fur and Minni Minnawi of the Zaghawa.\n\nGeneral Omar al-Bashir and the National Islamic Front headed by Dr. Hassan al-Turabi overthrew the Sudanese government led by Ahmed al-Mirghani in 1989. A large section of the population in Darfur, particularly the non-Arab ethnicities in the region, became increasingly marginalized. These feelings were crystallized by the publication in 2000 of \"\", which detailed the structural inequity in the Sudan that denies non-Arabs equal justice and power sharing. In 2002 Abdul Wahid al Nur, a lawyer, Ahmad Abdel Shafi Bassey, an education student, and a third man founded the Darfur Liberation Front, which subsequently evolved into the Sudan Liberation Movement and claimed to represent all of the oppressed in the Sudan.\n\nBefore the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi during the Libyan Civil War (2011), the Libyan Armed Forces were known to support at least parts of the SLM/A, such as the SLA-Unity. In turn, elements of the SLM/A reportedly became involved in the Second Libyan Civil War, fighting for different factions there in exchange for money and equipment. The SLM/A-Minnawi allied itself with the Khalifa Haftar-aligned Libyan National Army (LNA), and fought alongside it in the Battle of Derna (2018–2019), losing several fighters in combat for the town. On 12 January 2019, SLM/A-Minnawi clashed with the Chadian CCMSR rebel group (an enemy of the LNA) at Gatroun in southern Libya. Later that month, the SLM/A was accused by the CCMSR of aiding a LNA offensive in southern Libya.\n\nIn 2006, the Sudan Liberation Movement split into two main factions, divided on the issue of the Darfur Peace Agreement:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2031551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2031551", "title": "Jura Federation", "text": "Jura Federation\n\nThe Jura Federation represented the anarchist, Bakuninist faction of the First International during the anti-statist split from the organization. Jura, a Swiss area, was known for its watchmaker artisans in La Chaux-de-Fonds, who shared anti-state, egalitarian views on work and social emancipation. The Jura Federation formed between international socialist congresses in 1869 and 1871. When the First International's General Council, led by Marxists, suppressed the Bakuninists, the Jura Federation organized an international of the disaffected federations at the 1872 St. Imier Congress. The congress disavowed the General Council's authoritarian consolidation of power and planning as an affront to the International's loose, federalist founding to support workers' emancipation. Members of the First International agreed and even statists joined the anti-statists' resulting Anti-authoritarian International, but by 1876, the alliance had mostly dissolved. While in decline, the Jura Federation remained the home of Bakuninists whose figures engaged on a two-decade debate on the merits of propaganda of the deed. The egalitarian relations of the Jura Federation had played an important role in Peter Kropotkin's adoption of anarchism, who became the anarchist standard-bearer after Bakunin.\n\nThe Jura became the geographic center of the First International's anarchist coalition under luminary Mikhail Bakunin in the late 1860s and early 1870s, assisted by the Swiss government's laxity toward political agitators. The Jura Federation formed during infighting in the International between Bakunin and Karl Marx's factions. The Jura Federation split during the Fédération Romande congress of the International, in January 1869. Though Bakunin's faction was larger, the International's General Council was Marxist, and did not recognize the Jura Federation for its relation to Bakunin. The group was formally inaugurated at the 1871 Congress of Sonvilier with positions against the state and against the General Council (the Sonvilier Circular), which the Jura charged with turning free and autonomous parts of the International into an authoritarian hierarchy. The Federation started its journal, \"Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne\", in February 1872 to explicate its stance against the General Council.\n\nThe Jura Federation organized a group of the First International's apostate factions at the September 1872 St. Imier Congress. The Bakuninists from Jura, France, Italy, Spain, and the United States reaffirmed their Sonvilier Circular position and charged the General Council with violating the premises of their partnership: the autonomy of the federations and their ultimate cause: workers' emancipation. The St. Imier coalition agreed to a solidarity pact to ensure the member federations' independent autonomy and their common union against the General Council. The Bakuninists rebuked the General Council for its centralization of political power and advocation for uniform action towards social emancipation. The coalition would become the Anti-authoritarian International, as formalized at the 1873 Congress of Geneva, and it held that only the proletariat masses could seek social emancipation for themselves through free, spontaneous action and egalitarian economic federation: It could not be imposed from hierarchy.\n\nMembers of the First International largely supported the St. Imier congress, and opposed the General Council's suppression of the Bakuninists at the 1871 London Conference and 1872 Hague Congress. As a result, the Anti-authoritarian International congresses in 1873 and 1874 attracted Belgian, English, Dutch, and German federations into the fold, along with the First International's statist and anti-statist factionalism. The English Federation, for example, explicitly disagreed with the Jurassian position on action, but as long as the federations were free to pursue their own methods, affirmed the higher purpose of restoring a federalist International. The Jura argued for abstention from political action, citing their fruitless experiences with parliamentary politics and their subsequent organization outside political parties. By 1876, the alliance between the statists and anti-statists had mostly dissolved and the Jura Federation was in decline. The Jura watchmakers cooperative in La Chaux-de-Fonds had a work shortage and the group's isolation from the general population had worn them.\n\nBakunin retired from the Jura Federation in 1873 and died three years later. Jura remained a continuation of Bakunin's International alliance and Peter Kropotkin became the international anarchist standard-bearer. Jura was particularly influential in Kropotkin's adoption of anarchism. Skeptical of the First International's leadership in Geneva, had visited the organization's other stronghold, in Jura in 1872, where he was impressed by their egalitarian ethics, independence of thought, devotion to the cause, and opposition to the International's authoritarian elements. \"After a week's stay with the watchmakers,\" he wrote, \"my views on socialism were settled. I was an anarchist.\" He then returned to Russia and did not re-involve himself until 1877, the year after he escaped from Russia.\n\nMajor figures at Jura included James Guillaume, Adhémar Schwitzguébel, Severino Albarracín, Carlo Cafiero, Errico Malatesta, and Élisée Reclus. They discussed the practical and theoretical tenets of anarchist socialism, particularly \"propaganda of the deed\", whose question became associated with the group in 1876 and was debated for two decades. Adherents such as Malatesta and the Italian anarchists quickly adopted the tactic, while Guillaume was hesitant. Up until this time, the anarchist philosophy had flourished in small artisan communities, such as the watchmakers in Jura, and propaganda of the deed was intended to bond anarchist and workers' groups, as had been done in Spain and Italy. Upset by Kropotkin's advances, Guillaume left Jura in 1878.\n\nAn 1880 congress of the Jura Federation, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, adopted \"anarchist communism\" as its doctrine, as did many anarchists outside Spain, since the latter's anarchism was more dependent on trade unions. Schwitzguébel and his adherents in Jura were reticent at the adoption of communism over collectivism.\n\n\n\n\n"}
