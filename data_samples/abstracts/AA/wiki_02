{"id": "1793325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793325", "title": "Alfredo Ottaviani", "text": "Alfredo Ottaviani\n\nAlfredo Ottaviani (29 October 1890 – 3 August 1979) was an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church. Pope Pius XII named him cardinal in 1953. He served as Secretary of the Holy Office in the Roman Curia from 1959 to 1966 when that dicastery was reorganised as the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, of which he was Pro-Prefect until 1968.\n\nOttaviani was a prominent figure in the Church during his time and was the leading conservative voice at the Second Vatican Council.\n\nOttaviani was born in Rome, where his father was a baker. He studied with the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Trastevere, then at the Pontifical Roman Seminary and the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum \"S. Apollinare\", from where he received his doctorates in philosophy, theology, and canon law. He was ordained to the priesthood on 18 March 1916.\n\nOn 12 January 1953, he was both appointed Pro-Secretary of the Holy Office and created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica by Pope Pius XII. He participated as a cardinal-elector in the 1958 conclave which elected Pope John XXIII.\n\nOn 7 November 1959, he was named the Vatican's chief doctrinal guardian as Secretary of the Holy Office. Ottaviani was appointed Titular Archbishop of Berrhoea on 5 April 1962, receiving his episcopal consecration on the following 19 April from Pope John XXIII himself, with Cardinals Giuseppe Pizzardo and Benedetto Aloisi Masella serving as co-consecrators. His episcopal motto \"Semper idem\" (\"Always the same\") reflected his conservative theology. He resigned his titular see in 1963.\n\nOttaviani was the leader of the curial conservatives during the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), despite being nearly blind throughout the entire course of the council. At the council Ottaviani worked with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and others. During the last of the council's preparatory sessions, Ottaviani engaged in a heated debate with Cardinal Augustin Bea over the subject of religious liberty. Ottaviani, while opposed to the separation of Church and State and granting equal rights to all religions, supported religious tolerance if public manifestations of non-Catholic religions were suppressed when possible. Their confrontation became so intense that Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini had to intervene, noting his disappointment at such a \"serious discussion\". Ottaviani also argued during the debates on the liturgy and on the sources of Divine Revelation, which are understood as Scripture and Tradition in Catholic theology.\n\nIn 2000, John L. Allen wrote that the news media often went to Ottaviani during the council for colorful reactions to stormy working sessions: in one speech at the council, reacting to repeated mentions of \"collegiality\" of bishops, Ottaviani pointed out that the Bible records only one example of the apostles acting collegially, at the Garden of Gethsemane: \"They all fled.\" In 1985 Patrick R. Granfield had already recounted the same anecdote as something that \"may well be apocryphal\" and attributed it not to Ottaviani but to \"one Council Father\".\n\nAccording to Allen, Ottaviani was opposed in the movements for a rapid council by German Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne. Frings often clashed with Ottaviani on which direction the council should take. In this, he was assisted by \"a [then] progressive firebrand\" who was \"dissatisfied with many of the answers offered by the Church's official authorities\", a young theological advisor named Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and then Pope Benedict XVI. Frings had heard a lecture of the young Ratzinger on issues the upcoming council could address. It seemed to Frings that Ratzinger had set forth a complete agenda for the council that was exactly what Frings himself had in mind. Frings had Ratzinger prepare the text of a lecture that Frings was to give in Rome. After the lecture, which Pope John XXIII complimented warmly, Frings told the Pope that he did not deserve credit for the speech, as it was written by one of his priests. Pope John admitted that he too delegated much of his work. The key thing was to select the right person for the job. After this conversation, Ratzinger became Frings's lead assistant during the entire council and thereafter never left Frings's service.\n\nThe acrimony felt by such liberal members of the council against Ottaviani spilled out into international news in a dramatic incident on November 8, 1963, which Protestant observer Robert MacAfee Brown described as having \"blown the dome off St. Peter's\": in a working session of the council, Frings declared Ottaviani's dicastery a \"source of scandal\" to the whole world.\n\nWith continued worldwide interest in Vatican II, another internal matter concerning the proceedings of the council concerning Ottaviani found its way into international news. During the October 30, 1962, session concerning changes to the Mass, he went beyond the 10-minute limit imposed on all speakers. Upon Ottaviani passing this mark Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, Dean of the Council Presidents showed his watch to the council president for the day Cardinal Bernard Alfrink of Utrecht (whom the Associated Press described as \"one of the most outspoken members...who want to see far-reaching changes inside the church.\"). Ottaviani engrossed in his topic went on condemning the proposed changes, saying \"Are we seeking to stir up wonder, or perhaps scandal, among the Christian people, by introducing changes in so venerable a rite, that has been approved for so many centuries and is now so familiar? The rite of Holy Mass should not be treated as if it were a piece of cloth to be refashioned according to the whim of each generation.\" When he had reached fifteen minutes Alfrink rang a warning bell. When Ottaviani kept speaking, Alfrink signalled to a technician who switched off the microphone. After tapping the microphone to determine it was off, the half-blind Ottaviani stumbled back to his seat in humiliation while \"there was scattered applause in the council hall\" by members of the council fathers who held that he had gone on too long.\n\nScandalized by the reaction of his fellow council fathers, Ottaviani boycotted the next six council working sessions. When Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini of Palermo presided over the 11 November session he announced that \"Ottaviani had been grieved by the 30 October incident\" and asked council fathers to refrain from voicing approval or disapproval with applause. The Associated Press noted that \"Ironically, the incident...[was] favorably commented on by the non-Catholic observers attending the council, who were struck by the process and freedom of expression at the council\". As he was president of the Theological Commission responsible for amending the schema on sources of religion, Ottaviani returned to the working session to champion the position of those the Associated Press called \"the static traditionalists\".\n\nOttaviani was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Giovanni Battista Montini as Pope Paul VI. He was also the \"Protodeacon\" (senior Cardinal-Deacon) during the conclave, and as such, he announced Montini's election and crowning him on 30 June with the triregnum.\n\nWith the change of the name of the Holy Office to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1965, Ottaviani was named Pro-Prefect of the congregation; the pope held the title of \"Prefect\" until 1968. He was raised to the rank of Cardinal-Priest (with the same title) on 26 June 1967. As Pro-Prefect Ottaviani had described himself as a \"policeman\" who protected traditional doctrine.\n\nOn 8 January 1968 Ottaviani resigned from the church's central administration. Pope Paul VI accepted the resignation and appointed Cardinal Franjo Seper of Yugoslavia to take his place as Pro-Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The event was seen as \"a major turning point\" by the Associated Press, noting he was being replaced \"by a prelate from a Communist country that once imprisoned a Catholic cardinal...In dramatic fashion it signified the move of the half-billion-member church away from rigid conservatism toward new experiments in modernism and changing relations with Communist countries.\"\n\nIn 1970, when Paul VI restricted voting in papal conclaves to cardinals under the age of 80, Ottaviani, already 80, said the Pope's action was \"an act committed in contempt of tradition that is centuries old\" and that he was \"throwing overboard the bulk of his expert and gifted counselors\".\n\nOttaviani died on 3 August 1979.\n\nAt the beginning of 1962, Ottaviani notified the Jesuit superiors of theologian Karl Rahner that Rahner had been placed under Roman pre-censorship. That meant that the prolific theology professor could no longer publish or lecture without permission. A few months later, in November 1962, Pope John XXIII appointed Rahner to be \"peritus\" (an expert advisor) to and at the Second Vatican Council. Since Rahner accompanied the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna, Franz König, as a theological consultant, Ottaviani did not throw Rahner out of the council in spite of the earlier silencing.\n\nOn 25 September 1969, Ottaviani and Cardinal Antonio Bacci wrote a letter to Paul VI in support of a study by a group of theologians who under the direction of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre criticized the new Order of Mass (in Latin, \"novus Ordo Missae\"), and the new General Instruction (in Latin, \"Institutio Generalis\"), two sections (in not quite definitive form) of the revision of the Roman Missal that was promulgated on 3 April of that year but that actually appeared in full only in 1970. This letter became widely known as the \"Ottaviani Intervention\" and is often appealed to by Traditionalist Catholics as support for their opposition to the revision of the Roman Rite Mass.\n\nIn 1962, as head, under the Pope, of the Holy Office, Ottaviani signed its document known by its incipit \"Crimen sollicitationis\", which had as subtitle \"On the Manner of Proceeding in Cases of the Crime of Solicitation\". It laid down detailed rules about the procedure for ecclesiastical tribunals to follow if a priest was accused of making sexual advances connected in any way with the sacrament of Confession. Judges and other officials of the tribunal (\"each and everyone pertaining to the tribunal in any way\") would be subject to automatic excommunication if they revealed anything about the conduct of the trial, even after the verdict had been declared and put into effect. This penalty did not apply to accusers and other witnesses; on the contrary, anyone with knowledge of the crime who failed to denounce it within one month was subject to automatic excommunication and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest or at least promising seriously to do so. Violation of secrecy by the accused was also punished not by excommunication but by suspension.\n\nIn 2003, 24 years after Ottaviani's death, media reports presented this document as an attempt to \"hide sexual abuse\". Some reported that even accusers were subjected to excommunication if they made their accusations known, and that the document was stored in the \"Vatican Secret Archives\", where it was discovered by a lawyer pursuing cases on behalf of victims of abuse by Catholic priests. In fact, the 69-page document was sent to \"all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite\" and was to be found, even if after forty years it was generally forgotten, among the papers in their successors' offices. While media reports also suggested that the ecclesiastical verdict was never to be made known, the document itself spoke of the verdict being \"declared\" and \"put into effect\", and the punishments laid down in canon law were: \"He is to be suspended from celebrating Mass and hearing sacramental confessions and, if the gravity of the crime calls for it, he is to be declared unfit for hearing them; he is to be deprived of all benefices and ranks, of the right to vote or be voted for, and is to be declared unfit for all of them, and in more serious cases he is to be reduced to the lay state.\" These punishments were of public character and not subject to secrecy.\n\nAs Secretary of the Holy Office, Ottaviani was responsible for the banning of a number of books, which would accordingly have been included in any new edition of the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (Index of Prohibited Books). The \"Index\", the last edition of which had been published in 1948, was abolished by Pope Paul VI in 1966.\n\nOn 6 March 1959, the Holy Office issued a notification that forbade circulation of \"images and writings that promote devotion to Divine Mercy \"in the forms proposed by Sister Faustina\"\" (emphasis in the original). Faustina Kowalska was a Polish nun who in her diary recounted conversations with Jesus Christ. The negative judgement of the Holy Office was based on reasons that included its use of a faulty French or Italian translation of the diary. However, it was with Ottaviani's approval that Archbishop Karol Wojtyła of Kraków began in 1965 the informative process on Faustina's life and virtues, and the ban on her work was reversed by Pope Paul VI in 1978.\n\nOttaviani was critical of the writings of the bed-ridden Italian mystic Maria Valtorta, who reported visions of Jesus and Mary.\n\nWhen the typed version of the 15,000 handwritten pages of Valtorta's notebooks was prepared by Romualdo Migliorini and Corrado Berti (both Servite priests), they sought Vatican guidance for procedural advice on presenting the reputed revelations to the proper ecclesiastical hierarchy, as the local bishop's (Fontevecchia) vision was fading. At the Vatican they encountered Monsignor Alphonso Carinci and Cardinal Augustin Bea, Pope Pius XII's confessor, who advised presenting the typed manuscript directly to Pope Pius XII, through a recommended intermediary, which was accomplished in 1947. Ten months later, Carinci and Bea facilitated a meeting between the Servite priests and Pope Pius XII and it was recorded in \"L'Osservatore Romano\".\n\nDuring the papal audience, Pope Pius XII reportedly said: \"Publish this work as it is. There is no need to give an opinion about its origin, whether it be extraordinary or not. Who reads it, will understand.\" Berti signed an affidavit to this effect, stating that he had a verbal papal approval. However, once he approached the Vatican Press, he was summoned to the Holy Office, was seriously rebuked, and the Holy Office attempted to confiscate the original copies of Valtorta's writings. Valtorta's notebooks were published in 1950 by Michele Pisani as \"Poem of the Man God\".\n\nOttaviani ordered Berti to silence. Augustin Bea, was a consultor of the Holy Office at the time it condemned the book, as was Dominican theologian Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. A year after the death of Pius XII, Ottaviani placed the work among the list of books he presented to the newly appointed Pope John XXIII, who signed the decree banning all the books on the list.\n\n"}

{"id": "1793336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793336", "title": "Jerry Reinsdorf", "text": "Jerry Reinsdorf\n\nJerry Michael Reinsdorf (born February 25, 1936) is an American billionaire businessman, and the owner of the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the MLB's Chicago White Sox. He started his professional life as a tax attorney with the Internal Revenue Service. He has been the head of the White Sox and Bulls for over 35 years.\n\nHe made his initial fortune in real estate, taking advantage of the Frank Lyon Co. v. United States decision by the United States Supreme Court which allowed economic owners of realty to sell property and lease it back, while transferring the tax deduction for depreciation to the title owner.\n\nAs the owner and chairman of the Chicago Bulls since 1985, he oversaw the franchise turning into a lucrative business that won six NBA Championships in the 1990s (1991–1993 and 1996–1998). He is controversial for his involvement (along with Jerry Krause) in breaking up the championship team by not hiring back Phil Jackson. He hired Michael Jordan as a baseball player during his sabbatical from basketball. He also moved the Bulls from Chicago Stadium to the United Center.\n\nSince purchasing the White Sox in 1981, the franchise made the playoffs in 1983 for the first time since 1959, and won the World Series in 2005 for the first time since 1917. Reinsdorf moved the White Sox from Comiskey Park to New Comiskey Park in 1991, which was renamed U.S. Cellular Field in 2003, and once again to Guaranteed Rate Field in 2016. In both sporting endeavors, he has developed a reputation as an anti-labor union hardliner. Since the early 1990s, he has been considered one of the most, if not the most, influential basketball owners. He has been influential in instituting the salary cap and revenue sharing.\n\nOn April 4, 2016, Reinsdorf was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor.\n\nReinsdorf was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, and he was the son of a sewing machine salesman. A lifelong baseball fan who grew up in the shadows of Ebbets Field, Reinsdorf was in the stands the day Jackie Robinson debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking the color barrier which prevented black players from serving on Major League teams.\n\nReinsdorf earned a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. where he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi. He subsequently moved to Chicago in 1957. Reinsdorf became a CPA and lawyer as well as a registered mortgage underwriter and a certified review appraiser. He leveraged a full scholarship offer from the University of Chicago Law School into a scholarship from the Northwestern University School of Law. His first job after graduating from Northwestern in 1960 was a tax delinquency case of Bill Veeck who at the time owned the White Sox. In 1964, Reinsdorf went into private practice. He developed a specialty in real estate partnership tax shelters. He sold his business interests in the real estate partnership in 1973 and formed Balcor, which raised US$650 million to invest in buildings under construction. He sold Balcor in 1982 for $102 million to Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and brokerage arm of American Express. However, he continued to be President of the company for several years thereafter.\n\nIn 1981 he was wealthy enough to purchase the White Sox for $19 million. The purchase was brokered by American National Bank who arranged for a limited partnership. He followed previous eccentric White Sox owners Charles Comiskey, who was known as a miser, and Veeck, who was known as a prankster who gutted the team by trading away promising prospects. Soon after buying the White Sox, he signed Greg Luzinski and Carlton Fisk. He also tripled the team promotional budget and increased the number of team scouts from 12 to 20. By the 1983 Major League Baseball season the White Sox made the playoffs with the best record in the Major Leagues. The team initially signed a television deal with the newly founded Sportsvision under the new leadership of Chairman Reinsdorf and Vice Chairman Eddie Einhorn, but that arrangement quickly fizzled. Einhorn continued as Vice Chairman of the White Sox until his death in 2016.\n\nIn 1985, following in the footsteps of Einhorn who had purchased the United States Football League's Chicago Blitz franchise in 1984, he purchased the Chicago Bulls as part of a syndicate for US$16 million and quickly turned the team from one that averaged 6,365 fans per game at the 17,339-seat Chicago Stadium in 1985 into one with an 8,000-person season ticket waiting list. He did so by drafting Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen, and trading for Bill Cartwright to join John Paxson and Michael Jordan under the tutelage of head coach Doug Collins. In 1989, the team signed Phil Jackson as the final piece of the championship puzzle. From November 20, 1987 through Jordan's 1999 retirement, the Bulls sold out every game.\n\nIn the months prior to the purchase, Milwaukee businessman Marvin Fishman had been awarded a $16.2 million judgment against the Bulls. Fishman had been illegally blocked from purchasing the team in 1972. Reinsdorf purchased the team from an ownership group that included Lamar Hunt, George Steinbrenner, Walter Shorenstein, Jonathan Kovler, Lester Crown, Philip Klutznick, and the estate of Arthur Wirtz, and he held a $9.2 million controlling interest in the team. Reinsdorf's share of 56.8% of the team was purchased from Klutznick, Steinbrenner, Shorenstein and the estate of Wirtz. His purchase ended an era in which the Bulls were managed by committee with decisions by conference call, verdicts by vote. Reinsdorf acquired his majority interests on March 11, 1985 and Kovler sold his 7% stake in the team on January 29, 1986, bringing Reinsdorf's interest to 63%. The following week Reinsdorf ousted Rod Thorn as general manager and replaced him with Jerry Krause.\n\nThe White Sox have won American League regular season Division Championships in 1983, 1993, 2000, 2005 and 2008 under Reinsdorf and they won the 2005 World Series. In addition, they were in first place of the central division at the conclusion of the strike-shortened 1994 Major League Baseball season. The World Series victory made him only the third owner in the history of North American sports to win a championship in two different sports. The baseball championship boosted the value of the franchise to over $300 million. When Reinsdorf signed Jordan after Jordan's announcement that he wanted to play baseball, many thought Jordan's drawing power provided an ulterior motive. Reinsdorf, however, had tried to convince Jordan not to give up basketball, but he did not attempt to make Jordan the highest paid player in the game like some feel he should have.\n\nAs a basketball owner, he has been described by \"Time\" as a \"cheapskate\", a reference they also use for his baseball persona. As of 1995, the time when Scottie Pippen was eager to either be traded or be rid of Krause, he had never renegotiated a contract. As a baseball owner, he has had a reputation as one of the most militant, anti-union, hard-line owners. \"Newsweek\" described him as \"one of the hardest heads in the 1994 baseball strike\". In the baseball offseason between the 1992 and 1993 seasons, he completely abstained from the free agent market. Reinsdorf was one of the last holdouts to the 1996 labor agreement that instituted the salary cap while retaining arbitration rights for the players. His 1996 signing of Albert Belle made news because of his widely publicized general opposition to spiraling player salaries. The $55 million signing was a turning point in the decision by the baseball owners to agree to revenue sharing. The signing also made Reinsdorf the employer of the highest paid Major League Baseball player and highest paid professional basketball player (Jordan) at the same time. Reinsdorf had just re-signed Jordan after the 1995–96 NBA season. However, Jordan had been underpaid most of his career, and Reinsdorf, who did not feel he could justify the $30 million salary from a business standpoint, immediately realized he was going to soon feel buyer's remorse. Even his most successful baseball team was not highly paid: when the White Sox won the 2005 World Series, Reinsdorf had the 13th highest payroll of the 30 Major League Baseball teams.\n\nAfter Reinsdorf purchased the team in 1981, the White Sox experienced erosion of fan and media support. He complained about old Comiskey Park with its foibles such as numerous obstructed view seats and threatened to move the White Sox. Among his threats was moving the team to Itasca or Addison, Illinois in DuPage County. Reinsdorf, through his real estate business, purchased in Addison. Chicago Mayor Harold Washington lobbied the Illinois legislature, and subsequently then-Illinois Governor James R. Thompson promoted a package of incentives to retain the team in Chicago. The state floated bonds to build New Comiskey Park and let Reinsdorf keep all parking and concession revenues, as well as the $5 million per year from 89 skyboxes. Reinsdorf and Chicago Blackhawks owner, William Wirtz contributed $175 million to fund the construction of the largest arena in the United States. When the United Center opened in 1994 all of the skyboxes were leased for up to eight years. As per the collective bargaining agreement, Reinsdorf was allowed to exclude 60% of luxury suite revenue from \"basketball-related income\" and thus it is not part of the revenue sharing income.\nReinsdorf is a powerful baseball owner who in 1988 stopped the sale of the Texas Rangers and later influenced the sale of the Seattle Mariners. Edward Gaylord and Gaylord Entertainment Company had first attempted to buy the Rangers in 1985. Reinsdorf was also said to be largely responsible for the ousting of Fay Vincent as the Commissioner of Baseball in 1992. He had previously undermined Vincent by employing Richard Ravitch as the league's labor negotiator at a salary higher than Vincent's. By the early 1990s, Reinsdorf and acting Baseball commissioner (as well as Milwaukee Brewers owner) Bud Selig had assumed baseball's mantle of power from Atlanta Braves owner, Ted Turner, and New York Yankees owner, George Steinbrenner, who had in turn taken over the sport from Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers owner, Walter O'Malley, St. Louis Cardinals owner, Gussie Busch, and Oakland Athletics owner, Charlie O. Finley.\n\nIn the 1980s, Reinsdorf, Bud Selig and the American League President colluded to dissuade the Philadelphia Phillies from signing Lance Parrish who was a Detroit Tigers free agent. During the strike, Reinsdorf, who was an anti-union hard-liner, was so pessimistic that he did not expect baseball to resume until the 1996 Major League Baseball season. In the early 1990s he was able to get new stadiums (United Center and New Comiskey Park) for his teams.\n\nSome fans and columnists have accused Reinsdorf of breaking up the championship Bulls team after their third straight title and sixth in eight years, claiming the Bulls could have competed for more titles with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and good support from the rest of the team that in the eight-year span included Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant, Toni Kukoč, Ron Harper, BJ Armstrong, and coach Phil Jackson. Some accounts claim that because Jackson feuded with both Reinsdorf and Krause and because both Jordan and Pippen were linked to Jackson, the team was broken up. \"Forbes\" describes the scenario as an example of owner greed. Many note that Phil Jackson's decision not to return as coach and Jordan's retirement during the 1998–99 NBA season lockout impacted the decisions of several players on whether to return to Chicago. While Reinsdorf had held out hope that he could convince Jackson and Jordan to return and thus had introduced Tim Floyd as President of Chicago Bulls Basketball Operations instead of head coach, according to film footage from documentary series \"The Last Dance,\" Krause had made it clear to Jackson that he was not wanted back.\n\nReinsdorf was one of two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes that would commit to not relocating the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.\n\nReinsdorf is largely responsible for the revenue sharing of the internet rights of Major League Baseball in which all teams have shared equally since Major League Baseball Advanced Media (known as BAM) was established in 2000. Reinsdorf also endeavored to sell the naming rights to the New Comiskey Park to U.S. Cellular in a $68 million 20-year deal that funded a 7-year $85 million overhaul of the stadium that ended prior to the 2008 Major League Baseball season. The overhaul included the removal of top rows of the upper deck, replacement of the baby blue seats with traditionally-colored green ones and dozens of other upgrades. Prior to the seven-year overhaul, the 2001 White Sox barely broke even financially with a $700,000 operating profit on revenues of $101.33 million.\n\nReinsdorf won a major revenue sharing legal battle with other NBA owners over the Chicago Bulls broadcasts on WGN-TV. The 55 game schedule on the superstation for an audience of 35 million competed with the NBA broadcasts, but Reinsdorf was permitted to maintain the contract.

{"id": "1793385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793385", "title": "Khevsureti", "text": "Khevsureti\n\nKhevsureti (Georgian: ხევსურეთი, \"a land of valleys\") is a historical-ethnographic region in eastern Georgia. They are the branch of Kartvelian (Georgian) people located along both the northern (Pirikita khevsureti, Georgian: პირიქითა ხევსურეთი) and southern (Piraketa khevsureti, Georgian: პირაქეთა ხევსურეთი) slopes of the Great Caucasus Mountains.\n\nComprising the small river valleys of the Migmakhevi, Shatili, Arkhoti and the Aragvi, the province borders with Ingushetia and Chechnya and is included in the present-day Dusheti Municipality, Mtskheta-Mtianeti region. Khevsureti, with the area of approximately 405.3 square miles (1050 km²), is traversed by the main crest of the Greater Caucasus Range, dividing the province in two unequal parts. Pirikita Khevsureti (\"thither\") is a larger one, with the area of c. 565 km², while Piraketa Khevsureti (\"hither\") occupies 428 km². The largest villages are and Shatili.\n\nThe territory of Khevsureti, together with the neighboring area of Pshavi, was known to medieval writers under the joint designation Pkhovi or in the Georgian language: ფხოვი. Chronicler Leonti Mroveli mentions that after the conversion of the King Mirian III of Iberia and the Queen Nana into Christianity in the early 4th century, St. Nino continued to preach among Georgian highlanders (მთიულნი, mtiulni) including Pkhovi.\n\nMedieval Georgia was never able to establish a typical feudal system. The civil code of the community remained based on the ancient traditions and values. Children of the noble families and lords were brought up by the families of peasants (გლეხი, \"glekhi\") who were known for their wisdom and human qualities. These people introduced youth to their culture, history, traditions and all aspects of human knowledge and experiences based on Christian Orthodox values. (See Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church)\n\nHistorically, Georgian highlander communities enjoyed a degree of autonomy. Khevsurs never accepted local lords; they elected their leaders or Khevisberi (ხევისბერი, \"elder\") and council of elders and submitted themselves only to the monarch (see List of the Kings of Georgia). They were exceptional warriors with traditional Georgian qualities of courage, openness and honesty, fraternity, independence and love of freedom, who were often promoted as royal bodyguards. Kings regarded them as reliable guardians of the Caucasus Mountains and the northern border of the kingdom. In the battles Khevsurs wore flags adorned with crosses and considered themselves permanent members of the army of the sacred flags and guardians of Georgian Kings.\n\nThere was a suggestion by Russian serviceman and ethnographer Arnold Zisserman who spent 25 years (1842–67) during Russian expansion in the Caucasus (see Georgia within the Russian Empire), that these Georgian highlanders were descendants of the last European Crusaders because their folk culture – the material, social, and religious practices – resembled those of the Crusaders. Although claiming to have arrived at the speculation himself, the meme appears in earlier sources and was a popular story among non-Georgians in Tbilisi.\n\nZisserman also writes that 'concerning their origin the Khevsurs have preserved a tradition: they consider a certain man by the name of Gudaneli as their first ancestor. He was a peasant vassal of a landlord in Kakheti, and to escape punishment for some crime which he had committed, he found refuge in the Pshav village of . From his two sons, Arabuli and Chinchara, originated the family of Arabuli, consisting of 320 homes, and the family of Chincharauli, with 210 homes.' American traveler Richard Halliburton (1900–1939) saw and recorded the customs of the Khevsur tribe in 1935. \n\nThe Khevsur men, dressed in chain mail and armed with broadswords, wore garments full of decoration made up of crosses and icons, which served as a means of protection according to Christianity which Georgia adopted early in 4th century. Greek historian Herodotus ( –  BC) notes that the Caucasian highlanders of that time, were brilliant knitters and embroiders of their dress or Chokha, which wore out but never faded from frequent usage. Young girls started knitting at the age of 6-7, but men studying and military training, because according to their tradition women were deprived from education and higher social status.\n\nThe suggestion that any historical evidence indicates that Khevsurs may have descended from crusaders has been thoroughly discredited, and Georgian scholars have universally derided the story. \n\nThey had a strict system of physical training in martial arts preserved as a Khridoli martial art, and which is a part of the rich Georgian military tradition.\n\nKhevsur dances also preserved in the national dances as a warrior dance Khevsuruli.\n\nTheir religion is a unique mixture of Georgian Orthodox Christianity and pre-Christian cults. They worship sacred places locally known as \"jvari\" (“cross’), \"khati\" (“icon”) or \"salotsavi\" (“sanctuary”). Aside from their religious character, these were the sites where the locals discussed and decided common matters such as raids against enemies, peace-making, appeals of various characters, etc. Even during the Soviet period, with its harsh restrictions against any religious activities, each year the Georgian highlanders gathered with a group of elder priests and performed their traditional rituals.\n\nAs of the 1873 census, Khevsureti had the population of 4,872. By 1926, the population shrank to 3,885.\n\nFigures from the Russian imperial census of 1873 given in Dr. Gustav Radde's \"Die Chews'uren und ihr Land — ein monographischer Versuch untersucht im Sommer 1876\" (published by Cassel in 1878) divide the villages of Khevsureti into eight communities:\n\n\n1873 TOTAL: 61 villages, 1,251 households, consisting of 2,967 men and 3,029 women, in all 5,996 souls.\n\nThese figures can be compared with those given in Sergi Makalatia's \"Khevsureti\" (Komunistis Stamba, Tbilisi: 1935; in Georgian):\n\n\n1935(?) TOTAL: 43 villages, 769 households, consisting of 1,492 men and 1,668 women, in all 3,160 souls.\n\nThere are, of course, many reasons for which a comparison of these two censuses would be a tricky and to some extent pointless exercise. For what it is worth, however, such a comparison does confirm a process of rural exodus during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries whereby the Khevsurs seem to have abandoned isolated or higher-altitude settlements and moved down-valley to live in villages benefiting from more clement climatic conditions (or perhaps even to live in towns further afield).\n\nAlthough these figures must of course be taken with a pinch of salt (in the sense that they are based upon data whose reliability is unproven and debatable to say the least), a comparison between the two years (1873 and 1935) reveals\n\nSome disobedience offered by the Khevsurs to the Soviet ideology was a reason for obligatory migration to the plain initiated by the government in 1951. As a result, many high-mountainous villages were deserted. Economic hardship of the last two decades also increased a tendency towards migration.\n\nLike other mountainous areas of Georgia, Khevsureti is characterized by a great diversity of traditions and customs. Khevsurs speak a local dialect of the Georgian language that resembles the literary Georgian of the Middle Ages and retain many of their ancient traditions including elements of folk ritual.The institution of the Blood feud was still alive in the twentieth century.\n\nKhevsur music also resembles that of Georgia in the Middle Ages. Khevsureti is famous for its Medieval ballads and folk music. \n\nThe traditional costume of Khevsureti includes a male upper garment called the Perangi. While this bears some resemblance to the classic Georgian Chokha, it is shorter and trapezoidal in shape and features a more powerful color balance and a greater use of cruciform decorative motifs.\n\nThe architecture of Khevsureti is mostly highly fortified and defensive in character,featuring a profusion of towers clinging to the mountainsides,signifying constant vigilance in the face of enemy attack. The Khevsurs were renowned for their warfare with the (mostly Muslim) peoples of the Northern Caucasus including the Chechens,the Kists, and the many peoples of Dagestan. Due to the geographic,ethnic and religious complexity and lack of industrialization in the Greater Caucasus,it was a common occurrence for the tribes of the North Caucasus to attack and rob mountain-dwelling Georgians. Well-known Georgian poet Vazha Pshavela described the warfare of the Khevsurs in his poems. One of the most famous of these is \"Aluda Ketelauri\", the eponymous hero of which is a Khevsur youth, famous for his bravery and warrior skills. One day, after the Khevsur village of Shatili,where he lived, had been invaded by the Kists (historical name for the Nakh peoples), Aluda followed the invaders and killed both of the robbers. However,after killing the 'Kist' called \"Mussah\", Aluda began to weep,mourning for the warrior, in recognition of his bravery and dedication to his Muslim faith. When Aluda returned to Shatili he confessed to the villagers his admiration for the 'Kist' hero who had proved such a worthy adversary,but they were shocked at this praising of a 'pagan' and ended by condemning Aluda and expelling him from the community.\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" reported in 1911 that many curious customs still prevailed among the Khevsurs, as for instance the imprisonment of the woman during childbirth in a lonely hut, round which the husband parades, firing off his musket at intervals. After delivery, food was surreptitiously brought to the mother, who was kept in her prison a month, after which the hut was burnt. One of the more striking features of the traditional cultures of Khevsureti was the premarital relationship known as \"sts’orproba\" (or \"ts'ats'loba\" as it is known in Pshavi). A young couple could lie together during the night with a sword placed between them. Sexual intercourse between the pair was strictly forbidden. Any man who breached this rule was condemned to death.\n\nDozens of fortifications, sanctuaries and churches are scattered across the province. Chief of these are the Khakhmati fortress, Akhieli fortress, fortress, Mutso fortress, Shatili fortifications, Gudani Cross, and the Anatori Cross.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1793397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793397", "title": "Nicollet Island", "text": "Nicollet Island\n\nNicollet Island is an island in the Mississippi River just north of Saint Anthony Falls in central Minneapolis, Minnesota. According to the United States Census Bureau the island has a land area of and a 2000 census population of 144 persons. The island makes up a large part of the city-designated Nicollet Island/East Bank neighborhood. The island is named for cartographer Joseph Nicollet, who mapped the Upper Mississippi in the 1830s.\n\nThe island lies in the middle of the Mississippi, crossed by the Hennepin Avenue Bridge connecting Downtown and Northeast Minneapolis. The island is so near to Saint Anthony Falls that if the northward movement of the falls had not been stopped in the late 19th century, the island would no longer exist. In the early 19th century Nicollet Island was one of six islands near the falls, but all the others have been destroyed or joined to the east bank.\n\nThe island was the site of the first bridge across the Mississippi River, opened in 1855, on the site of the present Hennepin Avenue Bridge. It is part of Saint Anthony Falls Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, the Minneapolis region was inhabited by the Sioux (Dakota) and Ojibwe people, to whom Saint Anthony Falls was a sacred site. The Sioux used the island as a birthing place, and according to their oral tradition for ceremonies such as the vision quest and as a neutral meeting site.\n\nNicollet Island and the rest of the area of the falls were opened to settlement in 1838. Several settlers tried to obtain the best land near the falls, of whom Fort Snelling's sutler, Franklin Steele, took the best part of the east bank including Nicollet Island. He purchased the land for $1.25 per acre, which comes to about $60 for the island. After Steele obtained proper title to his land in 1848, he turned his energies to building a sawmill at Saint Anthony Falls to cut lumber from upriver, which began operations in September 1848. He built a dam on the east channel of the river between Nicollet Island and Hennepin Island. Steele platted the townsite of St. Anthony, which became a large city before merging with Minneapolis in 1872, on the east bank of the river. In 1848, Steele started a ferry across the river on the present site of the Hennepin Avenue Bridge.\n\nIn 1849 the first house was built on the island, for John Wesley and Ann Loomis North. Over the 1850s and early 1860s, more houses were built on the island, including several built by Franklin C. Griswold (some of which are extant, Griswold's own at 163 Nicollet Street). The island remained thickly covered with trees, and was described as a picturesque location frequented by lovers. A bridge was built between Nicollet Island and the east bank, and in 1854, Minneapolis and St. Anthony decided to build a bridge across the river. The suspension bridge that was built was the first ever to cross the Mississippi, and it opened with festivities on 23 January 1855. It was a toll bridge, originally charging 5 cents per pedestrian and 25 cents per team. The bridge was unsound and had limited capacity: photographs show signs that warned of fines for crossing too fast. The bridge brought the two communities closer together, leading to St. Anthony's later merge with Minneapolis.\n\nExtensive development of the island began after it was bought by William W. Eastman and John L. Merriam in 1865. In 1866, Eastman and Merriam tried to sell the island to the city of Minneapolis, to be a park, but the proposal was rejected in a referendum. Eastman and Merriam began building mills on the south side of the island and the Hennepin Island tunnel, and residential buildings on the north side. The Hennepin Island tunnel extended from Nicollet Island to the south end of Saint Anthony Falls via Hennepin Island. The tunnel collapsed in 1869, and almost destroyed Saint Anthony Falls, necessitating the building of an artificial apron for the waterfall. After the failure of the tunnel, Eastman built a system of turbines and cables to provide hydropower to factories on the south end of the island, including the Island Power Building (razed in 1937, it contained a variety of shops), a plant of the Cedar Lake Ice Company, and the Island Sash and Door Company (now the Nicollet Island Inn).\n\nEastman had his relatives and friends build their houses on the island, and built the Eastman and Grove Street Flats. Eastman's efforts lead many of the city's Gilded Age wealthy to live on the island, in the later decades of the 19th century. In 1876, a replacement suspension bridge across the Mississippi was opened. In 1867 the first railway bridge across the Mississippi in Minneapolis was built, separating the industrial south of the island and the residential north, as the Minneapolis BNSF Rail Bridge (an 1893 replacement) still does.\n\nIn 1893, northeast Minneapolis was devastated by one of the most damaging fires in Minneapolis history, which started on Nicollet Island. In 1900 Lasallian Brothers started DeLaSalle High School on the island.\n\nFrom the 1910s, Nicollet Island and the rest of the Gateway District declined, and the flats and houses on Nicollet Island were subdivided to create cheaper housing. The island became a poor neighbourhood, owned by a few landlords, who provided little maintaince to its residential buildings. The family of Morris Lerner came to own much of the island, and ran the Island Grocery there. The Lerners were described as generous by sometime tenants and ran their store at a loss, but were described as slumlords by disgruntled tenants and the city newspapers. During the 1960s, David Lerner entered into a long and public dispute with Nicollet Island residents who formed a tenants union. The tenants picketed outside his store and his home on Cedar Lake, and in response Lerner told a newspaper that his tenants were either \"nice ones\" or \"pigs\", citing the poor condition his tenants left his properties in. In the 1940s, the iconic Grain Belt Beer sign was erected on the island, at the time one of the largest neon signs in the country. DeLaSalle expanded over the 20th century, demolishing and building on the site of the Eastman Flats. It became a college preparatory school, and went coeducational in 1971 by absorbing a Catholic girls' school.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, northern downtown was redeveloped by the city and state government, which made numerous plans to redevelop the island. Most proposals involved razing the historic buildings of the island, and in many cases replacing them with new buildings such as high-rise apartments. In addition to various housing developments, proposals included a parking lot, an amusement park, a \"historic village\", and a conservation museum. City agencies favored using the island to increase recreational space near Downtown. Island residents resisted any change. In the 1970s, the island became a concern of preservationists and was included with the rest of the Saint Anthony Falls district on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn the 1970s the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board made plans to make most of the island into an open area, which initially called for razing the buildings on the island, citing the cost of restoration and the value of a larger park near Downtown. In 1979 the Park Board began acquiring large parts of the island with funds from the Metropolitan Council, with a plan that would keep only the houses on the west side of the island, making the east side an open space, and keeping only the Island Sash and Door Company among the island's other buildings. Because of the concerns of preservationists and residents, a further compromise redevelopment plan was made, and finalised in 1983. Following this plan, the Park Board restored the homes on the island and now owns them, but the previous residents were allowed to remain with 99-year leases despite the high cost of restoration. The controversies resurfaced when DeLaSalle tried to build a football field, which only went ahead after a ruling by the Minnesota Court of Appeals in 2007.\n\nDeLaSalle High School, a Catholic, preparatory high school, and the Nicollet Island Inn are located on the island, as well as three multi-family residential buildings and twenty-two restored Victorian-era houses on the north end of the island. The Inn was built in 1893 as the Island Sash and Door Company, and was a Salvation Army men's shelter from 1913 to the 1970s.\n\nThe south end of the island is home to the Nicollet Island Pavilion event center and the Bell of Two Friends, a gift from the city of Ibaraki, Osaka, Japan. The pavilion was built in 1893 as the William Bros Boiler Works.\n\n\n"}

They released three albums, \"Sub-Vocal Theme Park\" (1996), \"2020\" (2000) and \"Frequencies Will Move Together\" (2003) before disbanding in 2003. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 B(if)tek were nominated as Best Dance Release for the track, \"Bedrock\" which appeared on their second album.\n\nIn 1994 in Canberra Kate Crawford and Nicole Skeltys formed B(if)tek as an electronic music group, and began writing material for their first album, \"Sub-Vocal Theme Park\" (1996). Biftek comes from French \"le biftek\", which is borrowed from the English \"beefsteak\", while the English \"beef\" is originally from the French \"le bœuf\". It was sourced from Jean-Luc Goddard's 1961 film, \"Une femme est une femme\". According to the band's website the album was recorded by the duo during 1995 and 1996 in a local suburban garage and was released as a limited edition of 500 copies on the independent Geekgirl label.\n\n\"Blatant Propaganda\"s reviewer felt that \"Sub-Vocal Theme Park\" showed \"a range of cruisey analogue-synth based tracks... Trippy listening music, with lots of burbling bass, mellow grooves, occasional samples and spluttering filtered percussions.\" B(if)tek had a close association with the Clan Analogue collective.\n\nBy 2000 the duo were based in Melbourne, they had signed with the Murmur label, distributed by Sony Music Australia.\n\nFor their 2003 album \"Frequencies will move together\" the band received a grant from the Federal Government to investigate the effects of low frequency sounds on people.\n\nAfter the split, Nicole Skeltys changed musical direction, forming the psychedelic folk band Dust and releasing the album \"Songs\" in 2007. In late 2007, she formed the band The Jilted Brides and released the album \"Larceny of Love\". Since 2008, she has been based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2006, Kate Crawford began hosting an experimental music television show \"Set\" on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. She is also an author and academic and lives and works in Sydney.\n\nIn 2019, Kate Crawford, as one half of a duo named Metric Systems, released an album on Best Effort Records, named People in the Dark. Metric Systems is a collaboration with Bo Daley of Dark Network. The eight songs that make up ‘People in the Dark’ were recorded in studios across Sydney, Melbourne, Berlin and New York over a sixteen year span. The album draws from a large archive of recordings that move between minimal techno, modular downtempo, and more abstract electroacoustic experimentation.\n\n\n\nThe group also composed a four-minute soundtrack for the Kspace exhibition at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.\n"}

He had been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 1991, representing Hougang Single Member Constituency from 1991 to 2011, and Aljunied Group Representation Constituency since 2011. He is the MP responsible for the Bedok Reservoir–Punggol Division within Aljunied GRC.\n\nLow is one of six elected opposition MPs in Singapore's 13th Parliament.\n\nLow studied at Lik Teck Primary School and Chung Cheng High School before he attended Nanyang University, where he majored in Chinese language and literature, and government and public administration. In 1981, he completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Chinese studies at the National University of Singapore. In 1982, he completed a diploma in education. He worked as a teacher for a few years before starting his own business.\n\nLow joined the Workers' Party (WP) in 1982, and was subsequently appointed as its Organising Secretary. At the 1984 general election, he was the election agent for the party's secretary-general, J. B. Jeyaretnam, in his successful campaign to win Anson constituency.\n\nLow is well known for giving speeches in Teochew, which have won him much support from a large number of Teochew-speaking residents in Hougang Single Member Constituency.\n\nIn the 2016 Workers' Party Central Executive Committee (CEC) elections, Low's position of Secretary-General was contended by fellow Aljunied MP Chen Show Mao. This was the first time Low was challenged for the post since he took it up in 2001. Low retained his seat with 61 votes, to Chen's 45. Chen remains in the CEC as a member.\n\nLow announced at his party's 60th anniversary dinner that he would not be contesting for the post of Secretary-General for the 2018 party elections and would step down to renew leadership in WP after being at its helm for 17 years. Low formally stepped down as WP chief on 8 April 2018. Chan Chun Sing, the Minister for Trade and Industry, subsequently praised Low at a Parliament sitting on 15 May 2018 for the role he played in Parliament, acknowledging him as \"a fellow Singaporean and very much part of Team Singapore\", and that \"(w)hile (the PAP) may not always agree with (Low's) perspectives or methods, (the PAP) nevertheless appreciate(d) his efforts to work together to build a better Singapore.\n\nIn 1988, Low represented the WP in a televised debate with the PAP government on proposals to create an elected Presidency for Singapore, during which he engaged Ong Teng Cheong and Lee Hsien Loong, who later became the President and Prime Minister of Singapore respectively. In the general election later that year, Low, together with Gopalan Nair and Lim Lye Soon, contested the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) of Tiong Bahru against only the PAP and finished second with 42.2% of the vote.\n\nIn 1991, Low, as the Workers' Party's Assistant Secretary-General, won the single-member constituency (SMC) of Hougang in the 1991 general election and entered Parliament. In 1992, Low was appointed by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as a member of the Cost Review Committee. After a year of intensive study, Low decided to produce his own independent report as he had a different perspective from the other members of the committee.\n\nLow was re-elected as the MP for Hougang SMC at the 1997 general election, his second election victory in Hougang.\n\nOn 27 May 2001, Low became the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party, replacing J. B. Jeyaretnam. He was re-elected again as the MP for Hougang at the 2001 general election.\n\nAt the 2006 general elections, Low won his fourth straight term for the Hougang constituency. He received 13,987 of the votes cast, a 62.74 per cent victory margin which is an increase of 7.74% from the last general election in November 2001. His opponent from the People's Action Party, Eric Low, received 8,306 votes.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2011, Low and Chiam were the only elected opposition Members of Parliament (MP) in Parliament. At the 2011 general election, both Low and Chiam left their seats in Hougang and Potong Pasir SMC respectively to contest in Aljunied GRC and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC respectively, risking that there will be no elected opposition MPs in parliament. Low's gamble pays off as he led the Workers' Party to a historic breakthrough in the election, with a victory in Aljunied GRC. The win marked the first time ever that an opposition party had won a GRC, bringing an additional five Workers' Party MPs into Parliament. His previous seat in Hougang SMC was retained by his party member, Yaw Shin Leong.\n\nAt the 2015 general election, Low and his team won and retained their seats in Aljunied GRC. However, the team's votes share decreased to 50.96%, a drop of 3.76%, with a narrow margin of 1.9% (2626 votes). As the margin was within the 2% range, there was a recount. This was Low's sixth continuous win as an elected opposition MP (four in Hougang SMC and two in Aljunied GRC). He has been one of few elected opposition MPs to successfully defend a GRC.\n\nLow first met Han Mui Keow while they were students at Chung Cheng High School in 1973. They were married in 1982 and had two sons and a daughter. He is a Buddhist.\n\nOn 30 April 2020, he suffered a head injury from a fall at his home and was hospitalised at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. He was discharged on 21 May.\n"}

{"id": "1793447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793447", "title": "Ballad of Easy Rider (album)", "text": "Ballad of Easy Rider (album)\n\nBallad of Easy Rider is the eighth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in November 1969 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1969 in music). The album was named after the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", which had been written by the Byrds' guitarist and singer, Roger McGuinn (with help from Bob Dylan), as the theme song for the 1969 film, \"Easy Rider\". The title was also chosen in an attempt to capitalize on the commercial success of the film, although the majority of the music on the album had no connection with it. Nonetheless, the association with \"Easy Rider\" heightened the Byrds' public profile and resulted in \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in the U.S.\n\nThe album peaked at number 36 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart and number 41 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track was released as a preceding single in October 1969, achieving moderate success on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. A second single taken from the album, \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", was released in December 1969, but only managed to reach number 97 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe album was the second to be recorded by the Roger McGuinn, Clarence White, Gene Parsons, and John York line-up of the Byrds, although York would be fired shortly after its completion. Upon release, \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was met with mixed reviews, but is today regarded as one of the band's stronger albums from the latter half of their career.\n\nRecording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album, but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer.\nIn early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined, but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to Roger McGuinn, the Byrds' lead guitarist, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to complete the song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\".\n\nAfter seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000, McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility.\nTwo versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.\n\nAs recording sessions for the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album continued throughout July and August 1969, public interest in the band mounted as a result of their involvement with the \"Easy Rider\" film. This prompted McGuinn to announce that the title of the Byrds' forthcoming album would be \"Captain America\" (the name of Fonda's character in \"Easy Rider\"). Ultimately, this working title would not be used and the album was instead named after the film's theme song in an attempt to emphasize the connection with \"Easy Rider\".\n\nFollowing completion of the album, the Byrds' bass player, John York, was asked to leave the band in September 1969. York had become increasingly disenchanted with his position in the Byrds, and had been vocal about his reluctance to perform material that had been written and recorded before he had joined the band, believing it was spurious of him to do so. The rest of the Byrds had begun to doubt York's commitment and so a consensus was reached among the other three members that York should be fired. He was replaced, at the suggestion of drummer Gene Parsons and lead guitarist Clarence White, by Skip Battin, a freelance session musician and one-time member of the duo Skip & Flip.\n\nThe album opens with the McGuinn and Dylan penned title track, which is performed at a substantially quicker tempo than McGuinn's solo version from the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack. The Byrds' version of the song also features the addition of an orchestra, which had been added by Melcher in an attempt to emulate the then-recent hit singles \"Gentle on My Mind\" by Glen Campbell and \"Everybody's Talkin'\" by Harry Nilsson. \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was McGuinn's only songwriting contribution to the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album, due to his being preoccupied with composing music for a country rock adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\", which was anagrammatically re-titled as \"Gene Tryp\". \n\nThe remaining ten tracks on \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" mostly consisted of cover versions and interpretations of traditional material. Among these non-original songs was a cover of Dylan's \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", which the band had attempted to record twice before in June and August 1965, during the sessions for their second album, \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\". These earlier recordings had gone unreleased at the time and McGuinn decided to revisit the composition in 1969, slowing down the tempo and radically altering the arrangement to fashion a more somber and serious version than those recorded in 1965. The Byrds' 1969 rendition of \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" was released as the B-side of the \"Jesus Is Just Alright\" single.\n\nOther covers on the album included Woody Guthrie's \"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\", a poignant account of a plane crash involving migrant farm workers; the gospel-styled \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", which went on to influence The Doobie Brothers' hit recording of the song; and Pamela Polland's \"Tulsa County Blue\", which would later become a moderate country hit for Anita Carter in 1971. Although \"Tulsa County Blue\" had been brought to the album sessions by John York and had also been sung by him in concert, the album version features McGuinn on lead vocals. An outtake recording of \"Tulsa County Blue\" with York singing was finally released as a bonus track on the 1997 Columbia/Legacy reissue of \"Ballad of Easy Rider\".\n\nAnother cover included on the album was \"There Must Be Someone (I Can Turn To)\", a song principally written by country singer Vern Gosdin, after he returned home one evening to find that his wife had left him and taken their children with her. The final track on the album was a meditation on the July 20, 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing, titled \"Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins\", which continued the tradition of ending Byrds' albums on a quirky, tongue-in-cheek note.\n\nThe Byrds also recorded a number of traditional songs for the album: the sea shanty \"Jack Tarr the Sailor\", which McGuinn sang in an approximation of an English accent; a harmony-laden arrangement of the Baptist hymn \"Oil in My Lamp\"; a rendition of \"Way Beyond the Sun\", which had been inspired by the song's appearance on the debut album by Pentangle; and a Moog synthesizer dominated version of \"Fiddler a Dram\". Ultimately, \"Way Beyond the Sun\" and \"Fiddler a Dram\" would not be included in the album's final track listing and would remain unreleased until the former appeared on \"The Byrds\" box set in 1990, and the latter was included on the 1997 reissue of \"Ballad of Easy Rider\".\n\nThe album also featured the John York composition \"Fido\", a song written about a stray dog that the bass player had encountered in a Kansas City hotel room while on tour. The inclusion of the song made \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" the second Byrds' album in a row to feature a paean to a canine companion (the first being \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", which had included the song \"Old Blue\"). A third song about a dog, \"Bugler\", would later appear on the band's 1971 album, \"Farther Along\". \"Fido\" is notable for featuring a drum solo, the only example of such a solo on any of the Byrds' studio albums. Drummer Gene Parsons also contributed the song \"Gunga Din\", which related the story of two separate incidents: the first being the Byrds' appearance at a concert in Central Park where Chuck Berry had been billed to perform but had failed to appear; and the second involving John York and his mother being refused admittance to a restaurant, due to York wearing a leather jacket.\n\n\"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was released on November 10, 1969 in the United States (catalogue item CS 9942) and January 16, 1970 in the United Kingdom (catalogue item S 63795). The album is notable for being the first Byrds' album to be commercially issued exclusively in stereo in both the U.S. and the UK, although there is some evidence to suggest that mono promo copies of the album were distributed in the United Kingdom. To emphasize the connection between the album and \"Easy Rider\", the back cover of the LP featured liner notes written by Fonda. His musings were written in a free-form, stream of consciousness style and optimistically opined (in a manner reminiscent of the chorus of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\") that \"whoever the Byrds are is just alright. OH YEAH!\"\n\nThe album peaked at number 36 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, during a chart stay of seventeen weeks, which was a substantial improvement over its predecessor, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\". The reverse was true in the United Kingdom, however, where the album reached number 41 on the UK Albums Chart, while \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" had reached number 15. The \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" single was released ahead of the album on October 1, 1969 (b/w \"Oil in My Lamp\") and reached number 65 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Although this single was issued in most international territories, it was not released in the United Kingdom. A second single taken from the album, \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", was released on December 15, 1969 and reached number 97 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but failed to chart in the UK.\nUpon release, the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album somewhat revived the Byrds' commercial fortunes, giving them their first U.S. Top 40 album since \"Younger Than Yesterday\" in 1967. This renewed success was, in part, due to the band's public profile having been increased as a result of their involvement with \"Easy Rider\" and the inclusion of three Byrds-related songs on the film's soundtrack album. Columbia Records' was eager to capitalize on this new-found popularity and launched an advertising campaign for the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album, proclaiming \"The movie gave you the facts, the Ballad interprets them.\" However, as Byrds expert Tim Conners has stated on his website, with the exception of the title track, none of the songs on the album had much to do with the film. In fact, the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan has remarked that the album cover's sepia-toned photograph of Lemuel Parsons (Gene Parsons' father) sitting astride an archaic 1928 Harley-Davidson could almost be seen as a parody of the film's biker ethos.\n\nThe album was met with mixed reviews at the time of its release, with Ed Leimbacher, in the December 1969 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, criticizing the music on the album as \"only intermittently successful\" and concluding that \"the Byrds are still on the wing, but seem a little woozy and wobbly.\" Todd Selbert, writing in \"Jazz & Pop\" magazine, was more positive, describing the album as \"Pretty good Byrds - their best effort since the stunning \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\".\" In more recent years, renowned music critic Robert Christgau has dismissed \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" as \"the poorest Byrds album\", but also admitted that the album \"improves with listening.\" Mark Deming's review for the Allmusic website was more positive: \"\"Ballad of Easy Rider\" sounds confident and committed where \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" often seemed tentative. The band sounds tight, self-assured, and fully in touch with the music's emotional palette, and Clarence White's guitar work is truly a pleasure to hear.\"\n\n\"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form on March 25, 1997 with seven bonus tracks, including the outtakes, \"Way Beyond the Sun\", \"Fiddler a Dram (Moog Experiment)\", a rendition of \"Tulsa County Blue\" with John York singing lead vocals and \"Mae Jean Goes to Hollywood\"; written by the then little-known Jackson Browne.\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nThe Byrds\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n"}

{"id": "1793469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793469", "title": "Oath of the Horatii", "text": "Oath of the Horatii\n\nOath of the Horatii (), is a large painting by the French artist Jacques-Louis David painted in 1784 and now on display in the Louvre in Paris. The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public, and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style.\n\nIt depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a seventh-century BC dispute between two warring cities, Rome and Alba Longa, and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one's country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city. From Rome, three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them. Of the three Horatii brothers, only one shall survive the confrontation. However, it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa: he allows the three fighters to chase him, causing them to separate from each other, and then, in turn, kills each Curiatii brother. Aside from the three brothers depicted, David also represents, in the bottom right corner, a woman crying while sitting down. She is Camilla, a sister of the Horatii brothers, who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters, and thus she weeps in the realisation that, whatever happens, she will lose someone she loves.\n\nThe principal sources for the story behind David's \"Oath\" are the first book of Livy (sections 24–26) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his \"Roman Antiquities\". However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own invention. The painting led to the popularization of the Roman salute.\n\nIt grew to be considered a paragon of neoclassical art. The painting increased David's fame, allowing him to take on his own students.\n\nIn 1774, David won the Prix de Rome with his work \"Érasistrate découvrant la cause de la Maladie d’Antiochius\". This allowed him to stay five years (1775–1780) in Rome as a student from the French government. Upon his return to Paris, he exhibited his work, which Diderot greatly admired; the success was so resounding that King Louis XVI of France allowed him to stay in the Louvre, a privilege greatly desired by artists. There he met Pecoul, the contractor for the actual buildings, and Pecoul's daughter, whom he married. The king's assistant, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, commissioned \"Oath of the Horatii\" with the intention that it be an allegory about loyalty to the state and therefore to the king. Nevertheless, David departed from the agreed-upon scene, painting this scene instead. The painting was not completed in Paris, but rather in Rome, where David was visited by his pupil Jean-Germaine Drouais who had himself recently won the Prix de Rome. Ultimately, David's picture manifests a progressive outlook, deeply influenced by Enlightenment ideas, that eventually contributed to the overthrow of the monarchy. As the French Revolution approached, paintings increasingly referred to the loyalty to the state rather than the family or the church. Painted five years before the Revolution, the \"Oath of the Horatii\" reflects the political tensions of the period.\n\nIn 1789, David painted \"The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons\", a picture that was also a royal commission. Shortly afterward, the king went up to the scaffold also accused of treason, as the sons of Brutus, and with the vote of the artist in the National Assembly, which supported the execution of Louis XVI.\n\nThe painting depicts the Roman Horatius family, who, according to Titus Livius' \"Ab Urbe Condita\" (\"From the Founding of the City\") had been chosen for a ritual duel against three members of the Curiatii, a family from Alba Longa, in order to settle disputes between the Romans and the latter city. \n\nAs revolution in France loomed, paintings urging loyalty to the state rather than to clan or clergy abounded. Although it was painted nearly four years before the revolution in France, \"The Oath of the Horatii\" became one of the defining images of the time. In the painting, the three brothers express their loyalty and solidarity with Rome before battle, wholly supported by their father. These are men willing to lay down their lives out of patriotic duty. With their resolute gaze and taut, outstretched limbs, they are citadels of patriotism. They are symbols of the highest virtues of Rome. Their clarity of purpose, mirrored by David's simple yet powerful use of tonal contrasts, lends the painting, and its message about the nobility of patriotic sacrifice, an electric intensity. This is all in contrast to the tender-hearted women who lie weeping and mourning, awaiting the results of the fighting.\n\nThe mother and sisters are shown clothed in silken garments seemingly melting into tender expressions of sorrow. Their despair is partly due to the fact that one sister was engaged to one of the Curiatii and another is a sister of the Curiatii, married to one of the Horatii. Upon defeat of the Curiatii, the remaining Horatius journeyed home to find his sister cursing Rome over the death of her fiancé. He killed her, horrified that Rome was being cursed. Originally David had intended to depict this episode, and a drawing survives showing the surviving Horatius raising his sword, with his sister lying dead. David later decided that this subject was too gruesome a way of sending the message of public duty overcoming private feeling, but his next major painting, \"The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons\" depicted a similar scene - Lucius Junius Brutus brooding as the bodies of his sons, whose executions for treason he had ordered, are returned home. This was a subject the tragedy \"Brutus\" by Voltaire had made familiar to the French. \nThe painting shows the three brothers on the left, the Horatii father in the center, and the three women along with two children on the right. The Horatii brothers are depicted swearing upon (saluting) their swords as they take their oath. The men show no sense of emotion. Even the father, who holds up three swords, shows no emotion. On the right, three women are weeping—one in the back and two up closer. The woman dressed in the white is a Horatius weeping for both her Curiatii fiancé and her brother; the one dressed in brown is a Curiatius who weeps for her Horatii husband and her brother. The background woman in black holds two children—one of whom is the child of a Horatius male and his Curiatii wife. The younger daughter hides her face in her nanny's dress as the son refuses to have his eyes shielded.\nAccording to Thomas Le Claire:\n\nThis painting shows the neoclassical art style, and employs various techniques that were typical of it:\n\n\nWhen the royalty, churchmen, and aristocrats went to view the painting, they eulogised it; the Pope himself expressed his desire to view \"The Oath of the Horatii\". The painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1785, but it was delivered late. David's enemies at the Academy took advantage of the delay to exhibit the painting in a poor locale in the gallery. The public's dissatisfaction with the painting's poor viewing conditions obliged the gallery to move it to a more prominent location. David kept \"The Oath of the Horatii\" on exhibit for longer than expected to permit reporters to write about all of the paintings exhibited, not just his.\n"}
{"id": "1793471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793471", "title": "Ñetas", "text": "Ñetas\n\nThe Ñeta Association (Asociación Pro-Derechos del Confinado, \"Association for Prisoners' Rights\", Asociación Ñeta, or simply Ñeta) is the name of a gang that began in the Puerto Rico prison system and spread to the rest of the United States. Although Puerto Rico has many small street 'gangs' claiming its poorer neighborhoods, Ñetas is by far the largest and most dominant, controlling the illegal drug trade in the island's prison system.\n\nThe \"Ñeta Association\" was founded by Carlos Torres Irriarte, also known as \"La Sombra\" (\"The Shadow\"). It began in the late 1970s when several pro-independence political prisoners were incarcerated in the maximum security prison called Oso Blanco located in Rio Piedras. They formed as a mutual protection group in the late 1970s, ostensibly to improve living conditions and defend inmates from abuses committed by guards and other prisoners, as well as to fight the prison gang \"G'27\" (\"Group 27\"), or the \"Insects\" (\"Insectos\"). The G27s called the ñetas \"Worms\" (\"Gusanos\").\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Ñetas became the least dominant gang in the Oso Blanco prison after fighting both opposing gangs and crooked correctional officers. The majority of the inmates were fascinated by Irriarte's way of thinking and assisted the Association.\n\nBut the leader of the G'27s—along with the help of paid-off authorities—plotted Irriarte's murder hoping to destabilize the Ñetas. They were to ambush him when he left the watchful eyes of his followers on his routine walk to and from the prison chapel. On the afternoon of March 30, 1981, Irriarte, who was accompanied by an officer who was in on the plot, was attacked on his return from the chapel, which was located just west of the Recreational Yard. He was stabbed in the chest, stomach and back and then shot in the abdomen by a .38 caliber pistol. He was pronounced dead sometime after sunset.\n\nDuring the investigation of the murder of Irriarte, the correctional authorities found that he was probably betrayed by his lieutenants. His lieutenants wanted to get into the business of drug-trafficking in the prisons, but Irriarte opposed this. After the burial of their leader, the Ñetas exploded into an all-out rampage and took over several wings of the prison compound. Rumor has it that the majority of the Ñetas were drug addicts and in the drug-trafficking business, so almost every riot would end with an assault on the prison's pharmacy where they stole narcotic medications.\n\nThey first showed their power and brutal force when they retaliated against the G27's leader \"Manota\" in retaliation for \"the hit\" he helped plan against Irriarte. After a few days of digging and chiseling their ways through the prison walls with spoons and their bare hands, they broke through the wall of Manotas' prison cell and stabbed him over 150 times and cut his body into 84 pieces. There were rumors that certain parts of his body were mailed to selected people: a severed finger to his mother; his ankle and foot were sent to the warden of the institution; and his eyes were sent to G27's second-in-command. The rest of his body was never recovered.\n\nThe news soared and the media depicted the story as a hostile takeover. Used to their advantage, they used the media coverage as a means to send out messages to other members in different prisons across the island. Their message was clear: They wanted justice and they meant business. They warned the administration that if their demands about improving the living conditions within the facilities weren't met, there would be bloodshed and an all-out war. By the middle of 1984, their numbers multiplied excessively. They took over seven major prison facilities across the island and ruled them with an iron fist.\n\nToday, they still control a good part of the prison system. They denounce and punish sexual offenders, pedophiles and abusers, and exile them to solitary confinement where they are not allowed to interact with the rest of the prison population. It became such a force that the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation physically segregated Ñetas and their rivals in separate buildings or facilities within the prisons.\n\nReportedly in the late-1980s, the association was involved in the cult of the \"Holy Death\" and performed several ritualistic murders at the Oso Blanco State Prison. In 1988 they branched out and expanded into the east coast of the United States and the forefront of Canada. There they broke their roots to Puerto Rico and continued to branch out as far as South Florida. Forming into separate Factions or \"Chapters\", they were built into an almost Mafia-like umbrella, where there was a President, Vice President and lower hierarchy instated.\n\nIn the late 1990s, there were confirmed reports that Joanna Pimentel, known as \"La Madrina\", had been appointed council and leader of the New York City chapters. In 2001, Pimentel was convicted in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, of ordering a gang-related killing in 1995 and was sentenced to life in prison. She is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, a federal prison in Connecticut.\n\nBecause of their structure they are usually in alliance with People Nation. Their rivals vary throughout territories. Crips and Folks are usually on top of the list, as well as Dominican Power (DP), Dominicans Don't Play (DDP), MS-13, Los Sólidos, Grupo 31, and their lifelong sworn enemy G27 (Grupo 27). History shows that in certain areas of New York City they were even at war with the Latin Kings where the rivalry spread as far as Ecuador and Spain. Ñetas and Latin Kings are considered like cousins in NYC since the 90s. When they meet up they connect their hands together to throw up a crown paying homage to NDC and ADR. The Ñeta and Latin King sign connect. When Bloods started dominating Rikers Island, they snuck a razor in to \"buck fifty\" the pretty boy Spanish guys in jail across their face. Bloods are a sworn enemy that has since been dominate from the mid 90s. A sharp decline in the Ñeta gang presence has remained. Reports also show the same for Spain, where the war between the Ñetas and Latin Kings claimed many lives in Madrid. One way to identify members of the Ñetas are by the beads they wear around their neck. Their rosary styled necklace usually embodies a cross and are worn with the colors white, black, red. Another way is their clothing: they wear mainly white or the colors of the Puerto Rican Flag (red, white and blue, where sometimes blue is replaced by black). A white bandanna is also a good way to identify members. It's usually represented as their \"flag\" They may also be identified by using the letters \"ÑDC\" (\"Ñeta De Corazon\"—Ñeta From The Heart).\n\nThe Ñeta have a hierarchy that includes a Maximum Leader and council that branch out to State Officials and council and then Chapter Officials and council. They fall in a Pyramid as President, Vice president, Counselor, Moderator, Secretary, Vocal.\nÑetas refer to each other as \"hermanitos\" and \"hermanitas\" (brothers and sisters).\n\nRobert Walker of the website GangsOrUs.com has said of the Ñetas, \"they use the facade of a cultural organization and see themselves as oppressed people who are unwilling to be governed by the United States.\" Ñeta identifies with the Los Macheteros and their revolutionary philosophy in providing independence for the home island of Puerto Rico.\n\nToday, Ñeta Associations can be found throughout the prison systems of Puerto Rico, the United States, and Ontario. In 2009 they were reported as having up to 6,000 members in the North East Coast of the U.S. alone and to almost 13,000 in South America and thousands more worldwide. The Ñetas mainly operate out of the Tri-state and Upstate area, although they have ties with Los Sangeros Nuestra familia, a Mob family that operates in Puerto Rico, of which the leader is El Don. \n\nOn June 3, 2003, seven leaders of the Ñeta Association were arrested in Long Island, New York, for the stabbing and murder of two MS-13 members. On May 6, 2009, a Ñeta drug den was discovered and busted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, in the Queensbridge Housing Projects, located in Long Island City Queens. 156 kilograms of cocaine and 487 pounds of marijuana were found in the apartment complex located on 41st Street and Vernon Blvd. in 2009, Ñetas were reported to have major conflict with former allies, the Bloods, and a more severe conflict with the MS-13. In 2010, reports say Ñetas have been seen operating and connecting with the Bloods and Latin Kings. Ñetas are still having conflict and dangerous altercations with MS-13 and DDP. In 2014 The Ñetas have reached a peace treaty with almost if not all who claimed enemy to them. In many parts of not just the United States but other countries the Ñetas are rebuilding their image by becoming more involved in communities and politics.\n\nIn Spain, membership of the Ñetas is predominantly Ecuadorian. The main rivals of the Spanish branch of the Ñetas is the Latin Kings.

Drafted out of the Western Hockey League (WHL) 40th overall by the New York Islanders in 1993, McCabe competed in the 1995 Memorial Cup and was named to back-to-back WHL First All-Star Teams during his major junior career. He began his NHL career with the Islanders before stints with the Vancouver Canucks and Chicago Blackhawks. In 2000–01, McCabe began a seven-season tenure with the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he played the majority of his career.\n\nInternationally, McCabe competed for Canada, winning gold medals at the 1997 World Championships, 1994 and 1995 World Junior Championships and the 1992 Pacific Cup. He is also a one-time Olympian, having represented Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.\n\nMcCabe began playing junior hockey with the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1991–92. After one and a half seasons in Medicine Hat, he was traded to the Spokane Chiefs. He completed the 1992–93 season with 60 points in 60 games split between the Tigers and Chiefs. That summer, he was drafted 40th overall by the New York Islanders in the second round of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nOnce drafted, he returned to the Chiefs in 1993–94 and put up a junior career-high 84 points in 64 games. In his fourth and final year of junior, he was traded to the Brandon Wheat Kings for the remaining 20 games of the 1994–95 season, and he put up a total of 69 points in 62 games and was chosen as a First-Team WHL All-Star.\n\nIn 1995–96, McCabe began his NHL career with the Islanders. He recorded 23 points in his rookie season before being traded to the Vancouver Canucks midway through his third year (along with Todd Bertuzzi and a third-round draft pick in 1998, used to select Jarkko Ruutu) in exchange for Trevor Linden. He played one-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks before being traded to the Chicago Blackhawks on the day of the 1999 NHL Entry Draft in a bid by Canucks general manager Brian Burke to draft Daniel and Henrik Sedin second and third overall, respectively. McCabe was packaged with Vancouver's first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for Chicago's first-round pick in 1999.\n\nOn October 2, 2000, after a 6-goal, 25-point campaign with the Blackhawks in 1999–2000, McCabe was traded once again to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Alexander Karpovtsev and a fourth-round pick (Vladimir Gusev) in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. McCabe found his stride in Toronto and built on a 17-goal, 43-point breakout season in 2001–02 with 53 points two seasons later, culminating in a fourth-place finish in James Norris Memorial Trophy voting Second Team All-Star honours.\n\nAs NHL play was suspended due to the 2004–05 lockout, McCabe signed with HV71 of the Swedish Elitserien. He struggled with HV71 and exercised an escape clause in his contract before a game against Södertälje SK, where he was scheduled to be a healthy scratch. He had one goal, no assists, 30 penalty minutes and a –12 rating over ten games.\n\nWhen NHL play resumed the following season, McCabe emerged with a career-high 19 goals, 49 assists and 68 points in 73 games with the Maple Leafs. He finished the season third overall in points among NHL defencemen, behind Nicklas Lidström and Sergei Zubov. Near the beginning of the season, McCabe was recognized as the NHL's Offensive Player of the Week for November 13–19, 2005, and was later named as a reserve on Team Canada's 2006 Winter Olympic team in Turin.\n\nFollowing McCabe's career year, on June 28, 2006, he signed a five-year, $28.75 million contract extension with Toronto that included a no-movement clause. He scored 57 points in 82 games the following season.\n\nIn the dying seconds of overtime against the Buffalo Sabres on October 15, 2007, McCabe scored in his own net; the goal was credited to Paul Gaustad. McCabe was the focus of numerous trade rumours during the 2007–08 season, and on September 2, 2008, he was ultimately traded to the Florida Panthers (along with a fourth-round draft pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft) in exchange for defenceman Mike Van Ryn.\n\nMcCabe was named team captain of the Florida Panthers on September 23, 2009, and on November 6, 2009, he played in his 1,000th game in the NHL.\n\nOn February 26, 2011, McCabe was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for forward Tim Kennedy and a third-round draft pick.\n\nMcCabe announced his retirement from the NHL on February 15, 2012.\n\nWhile in junior, McCabe was a member of three gold medal-winning Canadian teams, the first of which was at the 1992 Pacific Cup in Japan. The under-18 tournament was in just its second year of what is now known as the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament. at the 1994 and 1995 World Junior Championships. In 1995, he was named to the tournament All-Star Team and was honoured as Best Defenceman after posting 12 points in 7 games.\n\nAfter joining the NHL, McCabe appeared in three consecutive World Championships, in 1997, 1998, and 1999, capturing gold in 1997.\n\nOn December 21, 2005, McCabe was named as a reserve for Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. On February 2, 2006, he was moved from the reserves to the official roster to replace an injured Ed Jovanovski. Canada would fail to defend its 2002 Olympic gold medal and was eliminated by Russia in the quarter-finals.\n\nSince 2017, McCabe has been the director of player personnel with the Florida Panthers.\n\nWHL\n\nInternational\n\nNHL\n\nMcCabe met his wife Roberta, a native of Long Island, during his stint with the New York Islanders, and together they have two daughters and one son.

Studying law in Kassa, he is said to have copied out the voluminous \"Handbuch des Schachspiels\" by hand, unable to afford his own copy. Despite the lack of competition in Kassa, he soon became a strong player, and also qualified as a lawyer.

It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, as regimes are, by definition, instances of international cooperation.\n\nWhile realism predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights, and collective security, among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition comes from Stephen Krasner, who defines regimes as \"institutions possessing norms, decision rules, and procedures which facilitate a convergence of expectations\".\n\nNot all approaches to regime theory, however are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like Joseph Grieco developed hybrid theories which take a realism-based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation \"never\" happens, just that it's not the norm—a difference of degree).\n\nAs stated above, a regime is defined by Stephen D. Krasner as a set of explicit or implicit \"principles, norms, rules, and decision making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given area of international relations\". This definition is intentionally broad, and covers human interaction ranging from formal organizations (e.g., OPEC) to informal groups (e.g., major banks during the debt crisis). Note that a regime need not be composed of states.\n\nWithin IPE there are three main approaches to regime theory: the dominant, liberal-derived interest-based approach, the realist critique of interest-based approaches, and finally knowledge-based approaches that come from the cognitivist school of thought. The first two are rationalist approaches while the third is sociological.\n\nWithin regime theory, because regime theory is by definition a theory that explains international cooperation (i.e., it's a traditionally liberal concept) liberal approaches prevail within the literature.\n\nLiberal interest-based approaches to regime theory argue that cooperation in anarchy is possible without a hegemon because there exists a \"convergence of expectations\". Regimes facilitate cooperation by establishing standards of behavior that signal to other members that they are in fact cooperating. When all states expect cooperation from the others, the probability of sustaining cooperation increases. Digvijay Mehra notes that regime theory lacks recognition of political parties and their role in altering the influence of international institutions, but Mehra's claims have generally been ignored in academic circles for their lack of evidentiary support and intellectual rigor.\n\nNeoliberals believe that realists neglect the degree to which countries share interests and the iterative nature of state relations. Realists err by implicitly modeling the world using the classic single-play prisoner's dilemma, in which the payoff structure makes defection a dominant strategy for both players. The difference between this model and reality is that states are not like prisoners, states must continually cooperate whereas prisoners will never see one another again. One's decisions today, then, have future consequences. Mutual cooperation is thus rational: the sum of relatively small cooperative payoffs over time can be greater than the gain from a single attempt to exploit your opponent followed by an endless series of mutual defections In \"The Evolution of Cooperation\", Robert Axelrod referred to single-shot exploitation as the behavior whereby states avoided \"tit for tat\".\n\nIn the iterated prisoner's dilemma, the actors' behavior is determined by the following assumptions:\n\nNeoliberal IR theorist Robert Keohane argues that international regimes can increase the likelihood of cooperation by:\n\nOther authors such as Kenneth A. Oye claim that regimes can provide incentives to cooperate and deterrents to defect by altering the payoff structure of the regime.\n\nRealists such as Joseph Grieco propose power-based theories of regimes based on hegemonic stability theory. Regime theory may appear to counter hegemonic stability theory sometimes, but realists also apply it within regime theory in order to explain change. When used in this way, realists conclude that a strong hegemon is what makes for a successful—i.e., robust, resilient—regime.\n\nIn brief, within regime theory, liberals and realists disagree on two things—the nature of international cooperation and the role of international institutions. Liberals believe that international institutions at most bring about an environment conducive to the convergence of state interests, which facilitates regime cooperation; and at least, facilitate cooperation that might otherwise not have been able to occur in an anarchic world. On the other hand, realists believe that regimes merely reflect the distribution of power in the international system, and that any cooperation that occurs under a regime would have occurred anyway. (Powerful states create regimes to serve their security and economic interests; regimes have no independent power over states, especially great powers; as such, regimes are simply intervening variables between power, the real independent variable, and cooperation, the dependent variable). For example, realist Susan Strange argues that institutions such as the World Bank, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), IMF, and other organizations established after World War II are only tools of American grand strategy.\n\nIn contrast to the rationalist approaches above, cognitivists critique the rationalist theories on the grounds that liberals and realists both use flawed assumptions such as that nation-states are always and forever rational actors; that interests remain static, that different interpretations of interests and power are not possible. The cognitivists also argue that even when the rationalist theories employ iterated game theories where future consequences affect present decisions, they ignore a major implication of such iteration—learning. Consequences from an iterated game look backwards to the past as well as forward to the future. So one's decisions today are not the same as one’s decisions tomorrow, not only because the actors are taking the future into account but because each is taking the past into account as well. Finally cognitivists use a post-positivist methodology which does not believe that social institutions or actors can be separated out of their surrounding socio-political context for analytical purposes. The cognitivist approach then, is sociological or post-positivist instead of rationalist. In sum, for the cognitivists, it’s not only interests or power that matters but \"perceptions\" and \"environment\" as well.\n\nAn example of a useful application of this approach to the study of international regime theory, is exemplified in a doctoral dissertation by Edythe Weeks, wherein she demonstrates that we can apply this type of analysis to explain and highlight key actors, unfolding political dynamics and historical-ideological shifts, related to commercial activities concerning outer space and its resources.\n\nAlternative approaches to liberal or realist regime theory tend to treat the debates over the normative bases of cooperation or otherwise as epiphenomenal. They emphasize instead the complex intersection of social forces, including changing values, that gave rise to ongoing political and economic regimes of power in the first place. For example, they emphasize the rise of modern bureaucratic regimes of negotiation or the normalizing of the global system of nation-states and multinational corporations as key players on the global stage:\n\n\n"}

In other words, there is no vertex outside the independent set that may join it because it is maximal with respect to the independent set property.\n\nFor example, in the graph formula_1, a path with three vertices formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4, and two edges formula_5 and formula_6, the sets formula_7 and formula_8 are both maximally independent. The set formula_9 is independent, but is not maximal independent, because it is a subset of the larger independent set formula_8. In this same graph, the maximal cliques are the sets formula_11 and formula_12.\n\nA MIS is also a dominating set in the graph, and every dominating set that is independent must be maximal independent, so MISs are also called independent dominating sets. \n\nA graph may have many MISs of widely varying sizes; the largest, or possibly several equally large, MISs of a graph is called a maximum independent set. The graphs in which all maximal independent sets have the same size are called well-covered graphs.\n\nThe phrase \"maximal independent set\" is also used to describe maximal subsets of independent elements in mathematical structures other than graphs, and in particular in vector spaces and matroids.\n\nTwo algorithmic problems are associated with MISs: finding a \"single\" MIS in a given graph and listing \"all\" MISs in a given graph.\n\nFor a graph formula_13, an independent set formula_14 is a maximal independent set if for formula_15, one of the following is true:\nThe above can be restated as a vertex either belongs to the independent set or has at least one neighbor vertex that belongs to the independent set. As a result, every edge of the graph has at least one endpoint not in formula_14. However, it is not true that every edge of the graph has at least one, or even one endpoint in formula_14\n\nNotice that any neighbor to a vertex in the independent set formula_14 cannot be in formula_14 because these vertices are disjoint by the independent set definition.\n\nIf \"S\" is a maximal independent set in some graph, it is a maximal clique or maximal complete subgraph in the complementary graph. A maximal clique is a set of vertices that induces a complete subgraph, and that is not a subset of the vertices of any larger complete subgraph. That is, it is a set \"S\" such that every pair of vertices in \"S\" is connected by an edge and every vertex not in \"S\" is missing an edge to at least one vertex in \"S\". A graph may have many maximal cliques, of varying sizes; finding the largest of these is the maximum clique problem.\n\nSome authors include maximality as part of the definition of a clique, and refer to maximal cliques simply as cliques.\n\nThe complement of a maximal independent set, that is, the set of vertices not belonging to the independent set, forms a minimal vertex cover. That is, the complement is a vertex cover, a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of each edge, and is minimal in the sense that none of its vertices can be removed while preserving the property that it is a cover. Minimal vertex covers have been studied in statistical mechanics in connection with the hard-sphere lattice gas model, a mathematical abstraction of fluid-solid state transitions.\n\nEvery maximal independent set is a dominating set, a set of vertices such that every vertex in the graph either belongs to the set or is adjacent to the set. A set of vertices is a maximal independent set if and only if it is an independent dominating set.\n\nCertain graph families have also been characterized in terms of their maximal cliques or maximal independent sets. Examples include the maximal-clique irreducible and hereditary maximal-clique irreducible graphs. A graph is said to be \"maximal-clique irreducible\" if every maximal clique has an edge that belongs to no other maximal clique, and \"hereditary maximal-clique irreducible\" if the same property is true for every induced subgraph. Hereditary maximal-clique irreducible graphs include triangle-free graphs, bipartite graphs, and interval graphs.\n\nCographs can be characterized as graphs in which every maximal clique intersects every maximal independent set, and in which the same property is true in all induced subgraphs.\n\n showed that any graph with \"n\" vertices has at most 3 maximal cliques. Complementarily, any graph with \"n\" vertices also has at most 3 maximal independent sets. A graph with exactly 3 maximal independent sets is easy to construct: simply take the disjoint union of \"n\"/3 triangle graphs. Any maximal independent set in this graph is formed by choosing one vertex from each triangle. The complementary graph, with exactly 3 maximal cliques, is a special type of Turán graph; because of their connection with Moon and Moser's bound, these graphs are also sometimes called Moon-Moser graphs. Tighter bounds are possible if one limits the size of the maximal independent sets: the number of maximal independent sets of size \"k\" in any \"n\"-vertex graph is at most\nThe graphs achieving this bound are again Turán graphs.\n\nCertain families of graphs may, however, have much more restrictive bounds on the numbers of maximal independent sets or maximal cliques. If all \"n\"-vertex graphs in a family of graphs have O(\"n\") edges, and if every subgraph of a graph in the family also belongs to the family, then each graph in the family can have at most O(\"n\") maximal cliques, all of which have size O(1). For instance, these conditions are true for the planar graphs: every \"n\"-vertex planar graph has at most 3\"n\" − 6 edges, and a subgraph of a planar graph is always planar, from which it follows that each planar graph has O(\"n\") maximal cliques (of size at most four). Interval graphs and chordal graphs also have at most \"n\" maximal cliques, even though they are not always sparse graphs.\n\nThe number of maximal independent sets in \"n\"-vertex cycle graphs is given by the Perrin numbers, and the number of maximal independent sets in \"n\"-vertex path graphs is given by the Padovan sequence. Therefore, both numbers are proportional to powers of 1.324718, the plastic number.\n\nGiven a Graph G(V,E), it is easy to find a single MIS using the following algorithm:\n\n\nThe runtime is O(\"m\") since in the worst case as we have to check all edges.\n\nO(m) is obviously the best possible runtime for a serial algorithm. But a parallel algorithm can solve the problem much faster.\n\nThe following algorithm finds a MIS in time O(log \"n\").\n\n\nANALYSIS: For each node v, divide its neighbours to \"lower neighbours\" (whose degree is lower than the degree of v) and \"higher neighbours\" (whose degree is higher than the degree of v), breaking ties as in the algorithm.\n\nCall a node v \"bad\" if more than 2/3 of its neighbors are higher neighbours. Call an edge \"bad\" if both its endpoints are bad; otherwise the edge is \"good\".\n\nA worst-case graph, in which the average number of steps is formula_26, is a graph made of \"n\"/2 connected components, each with 2 nodes. The degree of all nodes is 1, so each node is selected with probability 1/2, and with probability 1/4 both nodes in a component are not chosen. Hence, the number of nodes drops by a factor of 4 each step, and the expected number of steps is formula_27.\n\nThe following algorithm is better than the previous one in that at least one new node is always added in each connected component:\n\n\nNote that in every step, the node with the smallest number in each connected component always enters I, so there is always some progress. In particular, in the worst-case of the previous algorithm (\"n\"/2 connected components with 2 nodes each), a MIS will be found in a single step.\n\nANALYSIS: \n"}

She is best known for her role as Casey Chappel Davenport on the sitcom \"Wings\" from 1994 to 1997, and for having played the mermaid Madison in the television film \"Splash, Too\" in 1988 (the role originated by Daryl Hannah in the film \"Splash\"). She has guest starred in several television shows and appeared in the films \"\", \"Pretty Woman\", \"Problem Child\", \"Problem Child 2\", \"The Mask\", \"\" and \"\".\n\nYasbeck was born in the Cincinnati suburb of Blue Ash, Ohio, the daughter of Dorothy Louise Mary (née Murphy; 1922–1984), a homemaker, and John Anthony Yasbeck (1921–1982), a butcher and grocery store owner. Her father was of Lebanese descent, while her mother was of Irish ancestry. As a child, Yasbeck was featured on the package art for the Betty Crocker Easy-Bake Oven. Years later, in 2000, she was presented with a new Easy-Bake Oven on the show \"I've Got a Secret\", for which she was a regular panel member.\n\nShe spent her primary and secondary years at two different Catholic schools: Summit Country Day School and Ursuline Academy. After losing both of her parents, her father from a heart attack and her mother from emphysema, Yasbeck moved to New York City.\n\nEarly into her acting career, she appeared in \"Rockhopper\", an unsold CBS television pilot from 1985. Yasbeck has had guest-starring roles in many television shows, including \"Dallas\", \"Spies\", \"Werewolf\", \"J.J. Starbuck\", \"Magnum, P.I.\", \"China Beach\", and \"Murphy Brown\". She played Olivia Reed for four months between 1986 and 1987 on the long-running daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\". She also played the starring role of the mermaid Madison in the Disney television movie \"Splash, Too\" in 1988 (the role of Madison was originated by Daryl Hannah in the 1984 movie \"Splash\"). Playing a mermaid in \"Splash, Too\" was a fulfillment of a childhood dream for Yasbeck, as she loved mermaids when she was 5 years old after watching a Disney movie that featured mermaids. Yasbeck has also had starring roles in the sitcoms \"Wings\", \"Alright Already\", and \"Life on a Stick\" and in movies such as \"\", \"Pretty Woman\", \"Problem Child\", \"Problem Child 2\", and \"The Mask\". She has twice worked with Mel Brooks, in 1993's \"\" and 1995's \"\".\n\nYasbeck also appeared once on the hit DCOS \"That's So Raven\" as the mother of one of the main characters, Chelsea. The episode originally aired on September 22, 2006.\n\nIn late 2007, plans surfaced of a potential \"That's So Raven\" spin-off featuring Yasbeck and Anneliese van der Pol, who portrayed her daughter, with occasional appearances by Raven-Symoné. The show was scrapped due to van der Pol signing onto a new Broadway play, and Yasbeck wanting to take a break from acting to focus on her family.\n\nShe was a contestant on the syndicated version of \"Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?\" in 2010.\n\nYasbeck is the widow of actor John Ritter, with whom she had worked in several projects. She first met him at director Dennis Dugan's house during a read-through of their 1990 movie \"Problem Child\". According to Yasbeck, Ritter forced her to eat a bagel and cream cheese because he thought she was too thin. He also thought she was too young to play his wife in the movie (Ritter was 14 years Yasbeck's senior).\n\nYasbeck and Ritter also starred together in \"Problem Child 2\" (1991) and guest-starred together in an episode of \"The Cosby Show\" which aired in 1991. Ritter also guest-starred on \"Wings\" as Yasbeck's estranged husband in the season-seven episode \"Love Overboard\". The couple had a daughter, Stella (who in September 2016 transitioned from female to male changing his name to Noah Lee), on September 11, 1998, and they married one year later on September 18, 1999, at the Murphy Theatre in Wilmington, Ohio.\n\nOn September 11, 2003, Ritter fell into a coma when rehearsing for \"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter\". He was taken to the hospital by paramedics. He drifted in and out of consciousness and told his feelings to doctors. Initially, Ritter was thought to be suffering a heart attack. At 10:48 that night, Ritter died. The cause of death was actually an aortic dissection stemming from a previously undiagnosed congenital heart defect.\n\nYasbeck gave her blessing to the continuation of the sitcom, as \"8 Simple Rules\", where it was ultimately decided that Katey Sagal's character would assume the lead role as a widow.\n\nYasbeck appeared on \"Larry King Live\" on June 16, 2008, to discuss heart disease.\n\nOn the September 5, 1990, episode of \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", she said that her \"great-great-great uncle\" Charles Webb Murphy was the owner of the Chicago Cubs during their championships of the early 1900s.\n\nAfter her husband died, Yasbeck filed a $67 million wrongful death lawsuit against Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center and several doctors who treated him, alleging they misdiagnosed his condition and that contributed to his death. Several of the defendants settled out of court for a total of $14 million, including Providence St. Joseph, which settled for $9.4 million. On March 14, 2008, a jury split 9–3 in favor of the doctors, clearing the physicians of any wrongdoing.\n\n"}

{"id": "1793612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793612", "title": "Wickham Steed", "text": "Wickham Steed\n\nHenry Wickham Steed (10 October 1871 – 13 January 1956) was an English journalist and historian. He was editor of \"The Times\" from 1919 to 1922.\n\nBorn in Long Melford, England, Steed was educated at Sudbury Grammar School and the universities of Jena, Berlin and Paris. While in Europe, he demonstrated an early interest in social democracy and met with a range of left-wing figures, including Friedrich Engels, Wilhelm Liebknecht, August Bebel, and Alexandre Millerand. His encounters formed the basis of his first book, \"The Socialist and Labour Movement in England, Germany & France\" (1894).\n\nAppointed by Joseph Pulitzer as Paris correspondent for the New York \"World\", Steed joined \"The Times\" in 1896 as a foreign correspondent, working briefly out of Berlin before transferring successively to Rome (1897-1902) and then Vienna (1902-1913). In 1914, he moved to London to take over as foreign editor of \"The Times\". During his time in Vienna he acquired a deep contempt for Austria-Hungary. An anti-Semite and a Germanophobe, in an editorial published in \"The Times\" on 31 July 1914, Steed labelled efforts to stop the impending war as \"a dirty German-Jewish international financial attempt to bully us into advocating neutrality\". From 22 July 1914, Steed, in close agreement with \"The Times\"' proprietor, Lord Northcliffe, took a very bellicose line, and in editorials written on 29 and 31 July, Steed urged that the British Empire to enter the coming war.\n\nSeen as a leading expert on Eastern Europe, Steed's views had much influence with decision-makers such as high-level bureaucrats and Cabinet politicians in the First World War and its aftermath. During the war, Steed befriended anti-Habsburg émigrés such as Edvard Beneš, Ante Trumbić, Tomáš Masaryk and Roman Dmowski and advised the British government to seek the liquidation of Austria-Hungary as a war aim. In particular, Steed was a very strong advocate of uniting all of the South Slavic peoples, such as the Croats, the Serbs and the Slovenes, into a federation, to be called Yugoslavia. The British Ambassador to Italy claimed in a diplomatic dispatch that Steed's fondness for the Yugoslav concept derived from a relationship that he maintained for a number of years \"filially I believe rather maritally\" with a Slavic woman from the Balkans. In October 1918, Steed met with Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić to gain his support for the Yugoslav concept but was deeply angered when he learned that Pašić saw the new state as merely as extension of Greater Serbia and had no intention of sharing power with the Croats or the Slovenes. Steed charged Pašić with being a new \"sultan\" and severed his friendship with him.\n\nWhen the editor of \"The Times\", Geoffrey Dawson, resigned from his post in February 1919, Steed was Northcliffe's first choice to succeed him. Steed had worked closely with Northcliffe during the war, becoming an adviser to him on foreign affairs. Steed was forced to contend with Northcliffe throughout most of his tenure as editor, as the press baron retained considerable control over the affairs of the newspaper.\n\nAfter the war, Steed strongly disapproved of the Bolshevik regime in Russia. In an editorial written in another Northcliffe paper, the \"Daily Mail\" on 28 March 1919, Steed accused the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, whom Steed detested, of betraying the White Russians because of a plot by \"international Jewish financiers\" and the Germans to help the Bolsheviks stay in power.\n\nIn 1920, Steed endorsed as genuine a notorious anti-Semitic forgery, \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\", writing in an editorial in \"The Times\" in which he blamed the Jews for World War I and the Bolshevik regime and called them the greatest threat to the British Empire. However, he retracted his view on the \"Protocols\" in 1921, when his paper's Constantinople correspondent proved them to be a forgery.\n\nSteed was Northcliffe's personal choice for the editorship, but by 1922, the press baron was increasingly frustrated by Steed's failure to return \"The Times\" to profitability. After Northcliffe's death in August 1922, the new owners, John Jacob Astor and John Walter, dismissed Steed on 24 October and brought back Dawson as editor.\n\nIn 1923, Steed became editor of \"Review of Reviews\" (1923–30), the journal established by William Thomas Stead in 1890. In the early 1930s, he was one of the first English speakers to express alarm about the new German dictatorial chancellor, Adolf Hitler. In 1934, he caused sensation with an article claiming to have evidence of secret German experiments in airborne biological warfare. The British government was sufficiently alarmed to start stockpiling vaccines although a retrospective analysis by the epidemiologist Martin Hugh-Jones has suggested that Steed's evidence could not have amounted to much. On the title page of his 1934 work, \"Hitler Whence and Whither?\", Steed is described as a lecturer in Central European History at King's College London.\n\nHe died in Wootton, West Oxfordshire.\n\nSteed, played by actor Andrew Keir, appears in the 1974 miniseries \"Fall of Eagles\", bringing a rumour of the impending Bosnian crisis to the attention of King Edward VII, Georges Clemenceau, and Alexander Izvolsky.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Unlike mech simulator games such as the \"MechWarrior\" series, the mechs in \"Shogo\" are controlled essentially the same as in first-person shooter games.\n\nAn inherent feature of the combat system in \"Shogo\" is the possibility of critical hits, whereby attacking an enemy will occasionally bring about a health bonus for the player while the enemy in question loses more health than usual from the weapon used. However, enemy characters are also capable of scoring critical hits on the player.\n\nPlayers take the role of Sanjuro Makabe, a Mobile Combat Armor (MCA) pilot and a commander in the United Corporate Authority (UCA) army, during a brutal war for the planet Cronus and its precious liquid reactant, kato. Players must locate and assassinate a rebel leader known only as Gabriel. Prior to the game's first level, Sanjuro had lost his brother, Toshiro; his best friend, Baku; and his girlfriend, Kura, during the war. He is now driven by revenge and his romantic relationship with Kathryn, Kura's sister; in Sanjuro's words, \"It's kinda complicated.\"\n\nAt two pivotal points in the game, the player also has the opportunity to make a crucial decision, which can alter the game's ending. While the first decision is almost purely a narrative decision, the second decision actually determines who the player will be facing the rest of the game and how the game will end.\n\n\"Shogo\" was originally known as \"Riot: Mobile Armor\". It has heavy influences from Japanese animation, particularly \"Patlabor\" and \"Appleseed\" and the real robot mecha genre.\n\nThe expansion pack \"Shugotenshi\" would have given more insight into Kura's roles. It would have been six or eight levels of Kura fighting and coming to terms with the death of Hank. Some features of that game would have been various body armor for Kura and new enemies and weapons for her.\n\n\"Legacy of the Fallen\" would have moved away from the fighting of Cronus and taken the player to the remote kato mining facility at Iota-33. It would just show how well organized the Fallen actually were and the weapon capabilities of an Ambed (Advanced Mechanical Biological Engineering Division) team. \"Legacy of the Fallen\" was to have an entirely new cast of characters, five new mecha to choose from, six new onfoot weapons, five new mecha weapons, several new enemy aliens, and levels that played out more like \"Half-Life\"'s levels in structure.\n\n\"Shogo\" was ported to the Amiga PowerPC platform in 2001 by Hyperion Entertainment. Hyperion also made the Apple Macintosh port and the Linux port of \"Shogo\". The game had not sold as well as had hoped, most notably on Linux, despite becoming a best seller on Tux Games. Hyperion has put some of the blame on its publisher Titan Computer and because Linux users were likely to dual boot with Windows. A version for BeOS was also in development in 1999 by Be Inc.\n\nMonolith shipped 100,000 units of \"Shogo: Mobile Armor Division\" to retailers in the game's debut week, following its launch in early November 1998. However, the game underperformed commercially. It sold roughly 20,000 units in the United States during 1998's Christmas shopping season, a figure that Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter called \"disappointing\". Combined with the failure of competitors \"SiN\" and \"\", these numbers led him to speculate that the first-person shooter genre's market size was smaller than commonly believed, as the \"only FPS game that has done really well [over the period] is \"Half-Life\".\" \"Shogo\"s low sales resulted in the cancellation of its planned expansion pack.\n\n"}

He was the first player selected by the-then Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the expansion draft.\n\nSaunders initially signed with the Florida Marlins' minor league system in 1992, a year before their expansion season. He required reconstructive surgery on his elbow in 1994.\n\nSaunders joined the Marlins' opening day roster in 1997, and despite a knee injury which cost him seven weeks in the middle of the season finished with a 4–6 record in 22 starts, with his first three wins coming against the Atlanta Braves. The Marlins earned a wild card berth in the 1997 playoffs, and after being left off the Division Series roster, Saunders was placed on the LCS roster against the Braves. He started Game 3 of the series, which Liván Hernández won in relief of Saunders.\n\nIn the World Series, Saunders started Game 4 against the Cleveland Indians, but took the loss after giving up six earned runs in two innings pitched; nonetheless, he earned a World Series ring as the Marlins defeated Cleveland in seven games.\n\nSaunders was one of many members of that team who left the Marlins following that season, joining the Rays for their inaugural season after being the first pick in the 1997 MLB Expansion Draft. Saunders was 9th in the American League in strikeouts, but also 1st in walks, as he struggled to a 6–15 record. Saunders' 1999 season was short-lived as he went 3–3 with a 6.43 ERA. On May 26, 1999, while pitching against the Texas Rangers, Saunders fractured his humerus bone on a 3-2 pitch to Juan Gonzalez; the sound of it breaking was heard throughout Tropicana Field. He subsequently collapsed on the mound, screaming in pain and smacking his right arm on the ground. Within moments, team trainer Jamie Reed and teammates John Flaherty and Kevin Stocker rushed to his side. Saunders had to be carted off the field, as the pain was too much for him to walk. In addition to the fracture, he also sustained torn ligaments, causing him to miss the remainder of the 1999 season. In 2000, Saunders broke his arm again in a rehab assignment, forcing him to retire at the age of 26.\n\nSaunders won the Tony Conigliaro award in 2000.\n\nAfter baseball, Saunders worked as a stockbroker. In 2005, Saunders announced a comeback, signing a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles, and making their spring training roster. He pitched one inning against the St. Louis Cardinals before he was reassigned to the minor leagues. He remained listed on the Bowie Baysox roster for the whole 2005 season, but never pitched in a game, although he did appear in 9 games for the Mesa Miners of the Golden Baseball League.\n"}
{"id": "1793627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793627", "title": "Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)", "text": "Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)\n\nMa Yuan (; 14 BC – 49 AD), courtesy name Wenyuan, also known by his official title \"Fubo Jiangjun\" (伏波将军; \"General who Calms the Waves\"), was a Chinese military general and politician of the Eastern Han dynasty. He was a descendant of the Warring States period general Zhao She.\n\nMa Yuan was a native of what is now Xingping, Shaanxi province. His family was descended from the State of Zhao. His military and political achievements included helping Emperor Guangwu unite the empire and putting down rebellions of the Trung Sisters (in Jiaozhi, modern Vietnam) and the Wulin tribes (in modern eastern Guizhou and northwestern Hunan). He fell ill during an expedition to modern Hunan in 49 AD, and died soon afterwards. Prior to that, Ma Yuan contributed to Emperor Guangwu's defeat of the warlord Wei Xiao (), who controlled the modern eastern Gansu region.\n\nHe is considered one of the more famous generals in Chinese history, not only because of his military achievements, but also because he demonstrated perseverance and respect to his friends and subordinates. In addition to his military skills, his exhortations on personal discipline were also highly regarded. His daughter became Empress Ma of Emperor Ming of Han and was also highly respected.\n\nOne of his greatest achievements was the subjugation of the territory of the Nanman regions. It was for this he earned his title \"Queller of the Deep.\" He was reportedly revered in that area (as was often the case of great warriors of that period), and his temple was established somewhere there . The territory he subjugated corresponds roughly with North Vietnam.\n\nHe also subjugated the Qiang. In 34 A.D., the Xianlian Qiang and a number of other tribes, raided Chinese positions in Jincheng and Longxi commanderies and were defeated by Han armies. A few months later, Lai Xi was killed on campaign against Gongsun Shu, but his assistant, Ma Yuan, Grand Administrator of Lonxi commandery, continued operations against the Qiang. In 35, the Xianlian tribe were again defeated, first at Lintao in Longxi and then along the Xining river in Jincheng commandery. In the two separate campaigns, Ma Yuan captured more than ten thousand head of horses, cattle and sheep, together with considerable stores of grain. He was wounded in the leg during one of the final engagements, and he did not completely destroy the enemy, but he did drive them away from the valley lands of Jincheng, and he was rewarded with Imperial commendation and several thousand of the animals he had captured.\n\nThough members of the Qiang had escaped across the borders, Ma Yuan's victories in 35 had broken the power of the Xianlian tribe and had made possible a restoration of Chinese positions on the old frontiers.\n\nIn 49, Ma, while on expedition against the Wulin tribes (in modern eastern Guizhou and northwestern Hunan), died during the campaign from a plague, which also killed a large number of his soldiers. After his death, Ma's deputy Geng Shu (), who had disagreed with Ma's strategy, and Emperor Guangwu's son-in-law Liang Song (), who had prior grudges against Ma, falsely accused Ma of many crimes. Two specific accusations that are known are that Ma, by the route he took against the Wulin tribes, was responsible for the plague, and that he had, while on campaigns, embezzled pearls and rhinoceros horns. The latter accusation was a misunderstanding in that one of Ma's favorite foods (which he considered capable of warding off plague) was \"Coix lacryma-jobi\" var. \"ma-yuen\" (Chinese pearl barley), produced in southern China and northern Vietnam, which Ma had transported in large quantities back to the capital Luoyang. Emperor Guangwu believed these false accusations and posthumously stripped Ma of his fief and title of marquess. His reputation was not restored until his daughter later became empress to Emperor Guangwu's son Emperor Ming upon his ascension to the throne in 57.\n\nIt is said that during Zhuge Liang's attempts to suppress Meng Huo and the barbarians, he was inspired by a statue of Ma Yuan which helped him to overcome one of Meng Huo's most difficult obstacles.\n\nMa Yuan was the source of two Chinese \"chengyu\" idioms. One, \"wrapping one's body with horse leather\" (), refers to being dedicated to one's responsibilities that one is willing to die on the battlefield and have his body be wrapped in horse leather; Ma had given this phrase while talking to a friend as to why he wished to continue in military service. The other, \"drawing a tiger improperly results in a dog\" (), refers to his admonition to his nephews to be careful in their conduct and not to try to imitate a famed heroic figure of the time, Du Bao () -- in that if one tried to imitate Du but was not as heroic as he was, one would end up becoming a frivolous hoodlum.\n\nMa Yuan is worshipped as a deity in numerous temples in China and Vietnam. The Fubo Temples of Zhuzhou County, Hunan and Heng County, Guangxi are among the best known. Mount Fubo and Fubo Park in Guilin, Guangxi are also named after him. In Hanoi there is a Ma Yuan temple names Bạch Mã đền was built and worshipped at least since the Han dynasty. The worshipping stopped at the temple when the Sino-Vietnamese War broke out in 1979; historians believe that it was local Kinh tradition until the government abolished it due to tensions with China.\n\n"}

They were under the direct command of the shōgun and were in charge of undercover intelligence operations. That being said, in actuality their work consisted more often of reporting any news about the city of Edo to the shōgun or remaining incognito to inspect and report on the states of affairs in the countryside. In that sense their activities were comparable to those of the inspectors and general inspectors of the shogunate albeit under the direct orders from the shōgun. In spite of this, most historical plays and novels of the era depicted them as spies or ninjas, a tradition that continues to this time in popular culture. They were male servers in the inner palace of the shōgun during the Edo shogunate where they served under the command of junior elders. They were the guards of the Edo castle who keep the security and check every single thing for the sake of the Shogun's safety. The Oniwaban originated as ninjas lost their utility following the establishment of the Edo shogunate. While relatively low in ranking, as they could directly communicate with the shōgun they were able to attain some power, and some among their ranks were able to become close advisors or sent as diplomatic envoys. The character \"niwa\" in their name, meaning garden or yard, refers to the rumor that they were quartered in the garden of Edo Castle.\n\nDuring the Edo period, onmitsu (the term meaning a spy or an undercover detective) acted as secret agents in security and espionage functions, mainly intelligence and information gathering, sometimes with aid of \"kobushikata\", small groups of lower-class agents posing as mobile manual laborers and working under Iga ninja supervisors. The oniwaban followed a strict set of regulations, which, in some cases, forbade them from socializing with the general public.\n\nTokugawa Yoshimune established the Oniwaban as an elite cadre of originally about 20 handpicked onmitsu, providing him with information about \"daimyō\" feudal lords and shogunate officials, while also protecting high-ranking officials of the government and acting as security guards in the Edo Castle. They were possibly quartered in the garden of the castle, hence the name.\n\nAccording to some sources, during the tumultuous time of the Bakumatsu revolution the oniwaban were even sent to the United States to spy not only on the shogun's opposition, but on the Americans as well.\n\nThe Oniwaban have been depicted as the main characters in the television series \"Ōedo Sōsamō\" (an undercover group of secret agents, including Isaka Jūzō, Jūmonji Koyata, Konami and others) and \"Shōgun no Onmitsu! Kage Jūhachi\" (the group of Kanō Ametarō: Miki, Otojirō and Inokichi, brought together by Tokugawa Munetada) and in the film \"Oniwaban\" (known in English as \"Demon Spies\"). They were also featured in the TV series \"Abarenbō Shōgun\" (being the spies and bodyguards for Yoshimune, including Akane, Ayame, Gorōta, Hayate, Osono, Jūmonji Hayato, Koyuki, Kaede, Nagisa, Ōtsuki Hanzō, Saizō, Satsuki and Sukehachi), as well as in the manga/anime series \"Ga-rei\" (Hattori Naizou, a member of the Judgement Day brigade, was an Oniwaban in life), \"Gin Tama\" (Ayame Sarutobi, Zenzo Hattori and Jiraia), \"Lone Wolf and Cub\", \"Peace Maker\" (Shinsengumi member Yamazaki Ayumu), \"Samurai Champloo\" (Kariya Kagetoki), \"The Dagger of Kamui\" (the oniwaban monk Tenkai) and \"Yoshimune\" (the character Kunoichi, in love with the titular character). The first \"Shadow Warriors\" TV series has Oniwaban existing under Tokugawa Ietsuna, the fourth Tokugawa Shogun, but they are Kouga Ninja working against the Iga Ninja. The Oniwaban also appears in \"One Piece\" where they works for the Shogun Orochi.\n\nSome depictions feature the oniwaban in a time period following end of the shogunate, like the manga/anime series \"Rurouni Kenshin\" (featuring the now-unemployed Oniwaban group including Aoshi Shinomori, Beshimi, Han'nya, Hyottoko, Okina, Shikijō and Makimachi Misao) and \"Yokujō Climax\" (Hayato); others take place in an altogether fictional alternative worlds, even in the futuristic science fiction setting, such as in the case of the anime \"Chou SD Sengokuden Bushin Kirahagane\" (Jyuuha Gundam), the video game \"Red Earth\" (Oniwaban leader Kenji), and the miniatures game \"Infinity\". In the anime series \"Sailor Moon\" the name of the villain of the week Oniwabandana (renamed Ninjana in the English version) is also an obvious pun on the oniwaban.\n"}

It threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance to any country at war.\n\nNews that Revolutionary France had declared war on Great Britain in February 1793, and with this declaration that France, by the country's own volition, was now at war with all of Europe, did not reach America until the first half of April of that year. President Washington was at Mount Vernon attending the funeral of a nephew when he was given the news. He hurried back to Pennsylvania and summoned a cabinet meeting on April 19. It was unanimously agreed to issue a proclamation \"forbidding citizens to take part in any hostilities in the seas, on behalf of or against any of the belligerent powers.\"\n\nWashington's members agreed that neutrality was essential; the nation was too young and its military was too small to risk any sort of engagement with either France or Britain. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, in particular, saw in this question, the influence of the Federalists — his political rivals; yet he too agreed a proclamation was in order, though perhaps not an official one.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting of January 14th, Thomas Jefferson argued that while neutrality was a \"sine qua non\", there was no real need to make a Proclamation of Neutrality either immediately or even officially; perhaps there might be no need for an official declaration at all. The United States could declare its neutrality for a price, Jefferson intimated, \"Why not stall and make countries bid for [American] neutrality?\" In response, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton declared that American neutrality was not negotiable. Jefferson eventually resigned from his duty as Secretary of State in disagreement with the Proclamation of Neutrality.\n\nThe proclamation started a war of pamphlets between Alexander Hamilton (writing for the Federalists), and James Madison (writing for the Democratic-Republicans). In his seven essays, written under the \"nom de plume\" \"Pacificus\", Hamilton dealt with objections to the proclamation. Among his arguments were:\n\n\nThomas Jefferson (having read several of the \"Pacificus\" essays) encouraged James Madison to reply. Madison was initially hesitant. From his Virginia plantation, he offered Jefferson excuses as to why he could not write a reply, including that he didn't have the necessary books and papers to refute \"Pacificus\", that the summer heat was \"oppressive\", and that he had many house guests who were wearing out their welcome. Ultimately, Madison agreed to Jefferson's request, though afterward, he wrote to him, \"I have forced myself in to the task of a reply. I can truly say I find it the most grating one I have ever experienced.\"\n\nWriting under the name \"Helvidius\", Madison's five essays showed the animosity that had evolved with the two political factions. He attacked Federalists, and Hamilton in particular, and anyone who supported the Neutrality Proclamation as secret monarchists, declaring: \"Several features with the signature of Pacificus were [as of] late published, which have been read with singular pleasure and applause by the foreigners and degenerate citizens among us, who hate our republican government and the French Revolution.\" Madison brought to light the strict constructionist's view of both the Constitution and the Proclamation, demanding that Congress, not the president, had full authority over all foreign affairs except those areas specified in the Constitution.\n\nThe Proclamation of Neutrality (1793).

He has written over twenty books instructing people how to get money from the United States government. Widely recognized for recording television commercials, infomercials, and interviews in colorful suits decorated with question marks, Lesko's signature fashion also extends into his daily attire and transportation, \nearning him the nickname Question Mark Guy.\n\nLesko grew up in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Lesko received his undergraduate degree from Marquette University in Milwaukee. Upon graduation he was commissioned as an officer in the Navy. In the Navy, he served as a navigator aboard the USS Oxford in the South China Sea during the Vietnam War. When Lesko returned he earned a master's degree in business administration (MBA) from American University in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1975, Lesko quit his job designing computerized information systems and co-founded Washington Researchers with his then-wife Leila K.

Twisted is based on the event-driven programming paradigm, which means that users of Twisted write short callbacks which are called by the framework.\n\nTwisted is designed for complete separation between logical protocols (usually relying on stream-based connection semantics, such as HTTP or POP3) and physical transport layers supporting such stream-based semantics (such as files, sockets or SSL libraries). Connection between a logical protocol and a transport layer happens at the last possible moment — just before information is passed into the logical protocol instance. The logical protocol is informed of the transport layer instance, and can use it to send messages back and to check for the peer's identity. Note that it is still possible, in protocol code, to deeply query the transport layer on transport issues (such as checking a client-side SSL certificate). Naturally, such protocol code will fail (raise an exception) if the transport layer does not support such semantics.\n\nCentral to the Twisted application model is the concept of a \"deferred\" (elsewhere called a \"future\"). A deferred is an instance of a class designed to receive and process a result which has not been computed yet, for example because it is based on data from a remote peer. Deferreds can be passed around, just like regular objects, but cannot be asked for their value. Each deferred supports a callback chain. When the deferred gets the value, it is passed to the functions on the callback chain, with the result of each callback becoming the input for the next. Deferreds make it possible to operate on the result of a function call before its value has become available.\n\nFor example, if a deferred returns a string from a remote peer containing an IP address in quad format, a callback can be attached to translate it into a 32-bit number. Any user of the deferred can now treat it as a deferred returning a 32-bit number. This, and the related ability to define \"errbacks\" (callbacks which are called as error handlers), allows code to specify in advance what to do when an asynchronous event occurs, without stopping to wait for the event. In non-event-driven systems, for example using threads, the operating system incurs premature and additional overhead organizing threads each time a blocking call is made.\n\nTwisted supports an abstraction over raw threads — using a thread as a deferred source. Thus, a deferred is returned immediately, which will receive a value when the thread finishes. Callbacks can be attached which will run in the main thread, thus alleviating the need for complex locking solutions. A prime example of such usage, which comes from Twisted's support libraries, is using this model to call into databases. The database call itself happens on a foreign thread, but the analysis of the result happens in the main thread.\n\nTwisted can integrate with foreign event loops, such as those of GTK+, Qt and Cocoa (through PyObjC). This allows using Twisted as the network layer in graphical user interface (GUI) programs, using all of its libraries without adding a thread-per-socket overhead, as using Python's native library would. A full-fledged web server can be integrated in-process with a GUI program using this model, for example.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1793661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793661", "title": "Mickey Smith", "text": "Mickey Smith\n\nMickey Smith is a fictional character portrayed by Noel Clarke in the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". The character is introduced as the ordinary, working class boyfriend of Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a London shopgirl who becomes a travelling companion to the Ninth and Tenth incarnations of an alien Time Lord known as the Doctor. Mickey first appears in the first episode of the 2005 revival, \"Rose\". Initially someone who struggles in the face of danger, Mickey nevertheless acts as an Earth-based ally to the Doctor and Rose. In the second series he joins the pair as a second companion of the Doctor's, though leaves during the 2006 series to pursue his own adventures. He returns to aid the Doctor and Rose in the series finale later that year, and then again for the 2008 finale \"Journey's End,\" as well as fleetingly in 2010 in the Tenth Doctor send-off \"The End of Time\".\n\nExecutive producer Russell T Davies created the character alongside Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri) in order to provide a home context for Rose. The character's dubious personality traits were made evident; both Davies and Clarke postulated that the character \"deserved to lose his girlfriend\". Though Clarke felt his character was initially \"a clown\" he enjoyed having the chance to mature Mickey into a more heroic character in his later appearances. Television commentators generally reacted positively to this character growth. In 2007 the entertainment and media news website Digital Spy highlighted him as a \"Cult Spy Icon\".\n\nMickey Smith is first introduced in the series' 2005 reboot première episode, \"Rose\". When Mickey's girlfriend Rose (Billie Piper) begins investigating a mysterious alien called the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), Mickey is captured by the alien Nestene Consciousness, from which a living plastic facsimile of him (an 'auton') is created. Mickey, terrified by the revelation that alien life exists, fails to impress the Doctor, who only invites Rose to be his travelling companion in time and space. In the year since Rose absconded with the Doctor, Mickey has been the prime suspect for Rose's disappearance and has become distressed as a result. However, he assists the pair in defeating the Slitheen, a family of extraterrestrial criminals; using his computer hacking skills, he commandeers a military harpoon missile which he targets at 10 Downing Street to kill the Slitheen. Mickey then declines an invitation from the Doctor to join him and Rose in the TARDIS. A much younger Mickey, played by Casey Dyer, appears briefly when Rose attempts to alter her childhood in \"Father's Day\". In \"Boom Town\", Mickey later meets up with the Doctor, Rose and new companion Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in Cardiff, where he helps them foil a Slitheen plot. In the series' finale episode \"The Parting of the Ways\", when Rose becomes stranded at home at the Powell Estate, Mickey uses a recovery truck to crack open the TARDIS's console, through which Rose is able to absorb the time vortex and save the universe from an invasion of the hateful mutant alien Daleks.\n\nHaving investigated a case of possible alien activity on Earth, Mickey alerts the Doctor and Rose to strange goings on at a school run by Headmaster Lucas Finch (Anthony Head) in \"School Reunion\". On meeting the Doctor's former companions, investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and robot dog K-9, Mickey begins to see himself negatively as the K-9 to Rose's Sarah Jane: \"the tin dog\". In the episode's conclusion, the Doctor finally takes Mickey aboard as his companion. He appears in the next three episodes \"The Girl in the Fireplace\" and two-parter \"Rise of the Cybermen\"/\"The Age of Steel\", where the trio end up in a parallel world where vicious, emotionless Cybermen have just been invented. There, Mickey is mistaken for his parallel universe doppelgänger \"Ricky Smith\", the leader of a human resistance group called the Preachers. In the story's conclusion, following Ricky's death, Mickey decides to stay behind in the parallel world to look after the parallel version of his grandmother (Mona Hammond) and fight the Cybermen; Mickey's grandmother is dead in his universe. However, Mickey makes a surprise reappearance in finale episodes \"Army of Ghosts\" and \"Doomsday\", wherein like the Cybermen, he and fellow Preacher Jake Simmonds (Andrew Hayden-Smith) are able to cross the Void into our world. There, they help the Doctor repel simultaneous Dalek and Cybermen invasions. In the episode's conclusion Mickey returns to the parallel world, this time with Rose who is now also trapped there.\n\nMickey returns again in the series four finale episode \"Journey's End\" (2008), along with Jackie. Alongside many other recurring characters, they have come to help the Doctor defeat Davros (Julian Bleach), the creator of the Daleks. Mickey and Jackie save Sarah Jane from a Dalek attack, and the trio then surrenders to other Daleks in order to be taken to the Dalek headquarters, the spaceship \"Crucible\". There they join forces with Captain Jack. After Donna (Catherine Tate) defeats Davros, Mickey is one of several former companions who pilot the TARDIS. In the episode's conclusion, Mickey declines to return to the parallel universe because, having both broken up with Rose and lost his \"parallel\" grandmother, he can find no reason to go back. Leaving the TARDIS, he follows after Jack and the Doctor's former companion, UNIT officer Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). Mickey next makes a brief final appearance in the Tenth Doctor's final episode \"The End of Time\" (2010), when the dying Tenth Doctor visits all his companions and saves the now-married Mickey and Martha, \"freelance alien hunters\", from a Sontaran sniper.\n\nMickey appeared extensively in electronic literature and tie-in videos hosted by the BBC website. These websites are \"in-universe\", part of an alternate reality game set within the show. Concurrent with the 2005 series, Mickey ran the conspiracy theorist website \"Who is Doctor Who?\" (first featured in \"Rose\"). In the 2006 series, however, the website became \"Defending the Earth\". Both featured videos of Clarke as Mickey, informing the viewer of facts about the series, or introducing \"missions\" which would be played out in online Macromedia/Adobe Flash games. Several of Mickey's blog entries tied into the overarching Torchwood story arc, depicting interceptions by the Torchwood Institute. Games include tie-ins to the plots of 2006 series episodes, such as \"Tooth and Claw\" and \"Fear Her\".\n\nClarke also starred as Mickey Smith and Ricky Smith in several online 'Tardisodes'; these were 60-second webisodes and mobisodes (available online and via mobile phone download), which only aired in 2006. For the \"School Reunion\" TARDISODE, Mickey is researching UFO sightings online when he is blocked by a notice referring to Torchwood, prompting him to call Rose to investigate. In the TARDISODE prequel to \"Rise of the Cybermen\", Ricky Smith is seen viewing a message sent to all the Preachers, again on his laptop.\n\nMickey appears in one New Series Adventures novel alongside the Doctor and Rose, \"Winner Takes All\" (2005), and two Tenth Doctor novels, \"The Stone Rose\" and \"The Feast of the Drowned\". These novels are set before Mickey joins the Doctor and Rose as traveling companion in the episode \"School Reunion\". Mickey features as the centric character in the short story \"Taking Mickey\" from the \"Doctor Who Files\" series of hardbacks from BBC Children's Books. In Gareth Roberts' \"Doctor Who Magazine\" comic book story \"The Lodger\", the Tenth Doctor is forced to cohabit with Mickey; this story was later adapted into an Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) episode of the same name, with Mickey's role supplanted by that of Craig Owens (James Corden). In the comic book story \"The Green-Eyed Monster\", Rose becomes jealous when Mickey appears to suddenly have several Amazonian girlfriends. It is later revealed that these were actors hired by the Doctor in his bid to defeat a creature that feeds on jealousy which had possessed Rose. In the ongoing Ninth Doctor comic series, an unconventional storyline sees Mickey Smith, from a time after he has witnessed the Tenth Doctor depart for his regeneration, forced to deal with mysterious events in San Francisco with the aid of the Ninth Doctor. During this storyline, Mickey takes care to prevent himself being seen by Rose or the Ninth Doctor witnessing his wife Martha, with it being implied that this sight of what Mickey would become influenced the Tenth Doctor's higher opinion of Mickey after his regeneration.\n\nIn accepting the role Noel Clarke comments that he \"had to have a lot of faith\" in executive producers Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner because he felt the series was not of high quality at the time of its previous cancellation. Mickey was created alongside Rose's mother Jackie in order to explore the question of who is left behind after a companion leaves earth to travel with the Doctor. Russell T Davies created the two characters and returned frequently to them in order to make Rose \"real\" and \"give her a life\". Whilst Billie Piper, who played Rose, felt that the character of Rose was \"ruthless\" in abandoning elements from her home life, Clarke commented that he felt anybody would do the same, stating \"who can blame her really?\" He felt that Rose's relationship with Mickey consisted of her \"sitting on the couch, watching him watch football\". Retrospectively viewing the episode \"Rose\" in 2009, Davies identifies Mickey's characterisation as \"naturally selfish\"—in the same vein he identifies many of his characters—drawing into question his \"mysterious emails\" and the fact he \"abandons Rose for the football down the pub\". He suggests that the character \"deserved to lose his girlfriend, right from the start\". Clarke feels the character of Mickey wasn't widely liked in the first series, admitting that he also saw the part as a \"kids’ TV\" role.\n\nFollowing the production of series one, Davies took Clarke and Coduri out for dinner to discuss their contracts for the second series. Davies reveals that Clarke was excited about Mickey's development in the second series, particularly having the chance to carry a large gun and be an action hero. Clarke noted that he was \"amazed\" by the scripts for the second series, as he felt Mickey had at times been written as a \"buffoon\". He felt that the character had gotten \"progressively braver\" throughout the series and that as an actor he found it fulfilling that people had gone from disliking the character to saying \"how they love this guy now\". Mickey's character arc sees him join the Doctor and Rose as a companion, becoming in turn the shows first ethnic minority companion. Billie Piper explained that this upsets Rose initially because she \"likes to keep her life separate\" and \"wants The Doctor to herself because she's selfish like that\". Tennant stated that through his actions, Mickey \"earns his spot on board the TARDIS\". Clarke stated that he didn't want to focus on his status as the show's first ethnic minority companion, stating \"the fact that I happen to be a black actor is beside the point, I'm an actor first\". However, he felt that it provided a positive effect in that young fans of ethnic origin would no longer have to be a monster or alien when role-playing characters from the series.\n\n\"Rise of the Cybermen\" and its online Tardisode prequel, set in a parallel universe, featured Mickey's doppelgänger, Ricky Smith. Clarke stated that he enjoyed the chance to play a \"macho, gruff version of the character\" and also to play two different characters. However, he explained that the scenes which featured both Mickey and Ricky were difficult to film as they involved green screen work, and the necessity of Clarke filming each character's part separately. A deleted scene from \"The Age of Steel\", suggests that Ricky was originally intended to be in a gay relationship with his co-fighter Jake. The scene, included in the Series Two DVD release, shows Jake telling Mickey that he can't replace Ricky, as he will \"never have another boyfriend like him.\" Following Mickey's appearance in \"Journey's End\" the production team had intended for Clarke to join spin-off show \"Torchwood\" for its in 2009, but his career led him elsewhere. Reflecting on his time on \"Doctor Who\" in 2010 Clarke stated that he was happy with his character's development during the series. He comments that over the course of his appearances, Mickey develops from \"a clown\" into \"someone with a bit more edge and a bit more stubble.\"\n\nCharles McGrath of \"The New York Times\" described Mickey in \"Rose\" as Rose's \"well-meaning but dopey boyfriend\". In their review of the episodes \"Aliens of London\" and \"World War Three\" Graeme Burk and Robert Smith praised the character's development stating that \"by the time he faces down a Slitheen in his apartment, armed only with a baseball bat... you want him to become a regular companion.\" The authors felt that the character had \"grown magnificently\" by the time of his temporary departure in the second series, remarking favourably on his \"zero to hero\" arc in light of his status as the first ethnic minority companion in the televised series. By \"Army of Ghosts\"/\"Doomsday\" they contend that the character is \"at last... flirtatious, smart and dashing\".\n\nIGN's Ahsan Haque praised the addition of Mickey as a companion in \"The Girl in the Fireplace\", writing that he \"adds a new sense of discovery to the show, as the audience can easily relate to his sense of awe and his infectious excitement about being onboard a spaceship\". Haque was also positive about Mickey's development in \"Rise of the Cybermen\" when he finds his parallel universe counterpart and his grandmother alive in the parallel universe, as Haque felt that previously \"he's always been treated as a tossed-aside comic relief character that has no bearing on the story\". In a review for the follow-up, \"The Age of Steel\", Haque believed the episode was \"worth watching\" to see Mickey \"finally [step] up and finds a purpose\" and become a hero. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy highlighted Mickey as a \"Cult Spy Icon\", praising his development into a hero.\n\nIn 2015 Michael Hogan of \"The Daily Telegraph\" criticised the general portrayal of male companion figures in \"Doctor Who\". He described Mickey, alongside 2010-2012 character Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) and 2014 character Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson) as all \"basically soppy, sappy, slightly annoying plus-ones to far superior females\".\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings seventh overall in the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at South Carolina.\n\nTroy Williamson attended Silver Bluff High School in Aiken, South Carolina, and he was a letterman and excelled in both football and track. His mother (Shirley Williamson) had 11 kids. In football, as a senior, he rushed for 890 yards and caught 21 passes for 500 yards (23.8 yards per rec. avg.). He was an All-American, a consensus All-State selection, won Class-AA Player of the Year honors presented by the High School Sports Report, a Mr. Football finalist for the state of South Carolina, and helped lead his team to back-to-back state championships. After his senior season, he was rated the fifth-best wide receiver prospect in the Atlantic Region by PrepStar.\n\nIn track, Williamson was a two-time 100 meters and 200 meters state champion, with personal bests of 10.35 and 20.79 seconds.\n\nThe Vikings needed a receiver with deep speed after trading Randy Moss to Oakland, drafting Williamson with the 7th overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, using the pick acquired from trading Moss to Oakland. In the 2006−2007 off-season he claimed his hand-eye coordination was bad due to his depth perception and that was the reason for his 11 dropped balls, which tied for second in the NFL.\nThe Vikings 2007 season was equally difficult for Williamson, who finished with 240 yards and 1 touchdown. Most notably in the Vikings' finale, Williamson dropped two crucial passes. First, a wide-open Williamson dropped an almost-certain 72-yard touchdown pass from Tarvaris Jackson in the second quarter and then another pass that would have yielded a critical first down later in the game.\n\nAfter the 2007 season Williamson was traded for a 6th round pick to the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Vikings ended up using that pick to select Jaymar Johnson. Williamson controversially stated that he \"wants to duke it out\" with former Minnesota Vikings head coach Brad Childress, adding that they could \"meet at the 50-yard line and go at it.\" The Jaguars released Williamson on September 4, 2010.\n\nReceiving Stats \nReturning Stats\nRushing Stats\n"}

Bland\n\nRichard Parks Bland (August 19, 1835 – June 15, 1899) was an American politician, lawyer, and educator from Missouri. A Democrat, Bland served in the United States House of Representatives from 1873 to 1895 and from 1897 to 1899, \nrepresenting at various times the Missouri 5th, 8th and 11th congressional districts. Nicknamed \"Silver Dick\" for his efforts to promote bimetallism, Bland is best known for the Bland–Allison Act.\n\nBorn in Kentucky, he established a legal practice in Utah Territory after working as a miner and schoolteacher. He served as the treasurer of Carson County from 1860 to 1864 during the peak years of the Comstock Lode mining rush. He settled in Missouri in 1865 and established a legal practice in Lebanon, Missouri. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1872 and quickly established himself as a leading advocate of the free silver movement. He sponsored the Bland–Allison Act, which required the United States Department of the Treasury to buy a certain amount of silver and put it into circulation as silver dollars. He also established himself as an anti-imperialist. Bland lost re-election in the 1894 election but won his seat back in 1896.\n\nBland was a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1896, though he expressed reluctance about running for president. His marriage to a Catholic woman engendered opposition from the anti-Catholic elements of the party. Bland received the most votes on the first three ballots of the 1896 Democratic National Convention, but not enough to win the necessary majority. William Jennings Bryan, who also favored bimetallism, won the Democratic nomination on the fifth ballot and went on to lose to Republican William McKinley in the 1896 presidential election. After the convention, Bland served in the House from 1897 to his death in 1899.\n\nBland was born near Hartford, Ohio County, Kentucky to Stoughton Edward and Mary P. (Nall) Bland. His father was a descendant of one of the First Families of Virginia, including statesman and Continental Congress member Richard Bland. The Blands and Nalls were among the early families to emigrate from Virginia with Daniel Boone into the Kentucky wilderness. Despite the family pedigree and wealth in Virginia, Richard and his three siblings were raised in relative poverty on his parents' small farm. In 1842, when Richard Bland was seven years old, the situation was exacerbated by the unexpected death of his father. His mother's death followed in 1849, leaving the young teenager an orphan and forcing Bland to hire himself out as a farm laborer to survive. Despite growing up poor, he was able to attend Hartford College and graduate with a teacher's certificate. Bland then taught school in his hometown for two years before moving to Wayne County, Missouri at age 20, in 1855.\n\nHis first time of residence in Missouri was brief, Bland teaching just one term at a school in Patterson, Missouri before heading further west to California. While there he began to study law. He then moved to the western portion of the Utah Territory, part of present-day western Nevada, where he taught school, and tried his hand at prospecting and mining. It appears, from a eulogy delivered in Congress, that while in the West Bland was also involved in conflict with Native Americans on multiple occasions, although few details are known. While teaching school he continued to study law and after passing the bar began practicing in Virginia City and Carson City. It was during his time in California and Nevada he developed a lifelong interest in mining, silver in particular.\n\nRichard P. Bland's first elected office was treasurer of Carson County, Utah Territory from 1860 to 1864, the height of the Comstock Lode mining rush. Left without a job following Nevada's statehood and government reorganizing, in 1865 Bland returned to Missouri and began the practice of law with his brother Charles in the town of Rolla. The siblings remained in practice together until 1869 when \nhe moved to Lebanon, Missouri, seeing the town as more commercially viable because a predecessor of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad had recently laid track through the town.\n\nIn 1872, he was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in the 43rd Congress. From the start of his tenure, silver would be an issue of great importance to Bland. The Panic of 1873 and Coinage Act of 1873 hit Missouri and other Midwestern farmers particularly hard, leading to foreclosures and closing of businesses dependent on agriculture. In 1878, along with Iowa Republican William Allison he sponsored the Bland–Allison Act. This act mandated the use of both gold and silver as U.S. currency and allowed silver to be purchased at market rates, metals to be minted into silver dollars, and required the US Treasury to purchase between $2 million and $4 million of silver each month from western mines. Vetoed by President Rutherford Hayes, Congress voted again on the measure overriding the President. The act stood until President Grover Cleveland repealed the act in 1893.\n\nBland's nicknames -- \"The Great Commoner\" and \"Silver Dick\"— reflected his efforts to help both the common man and the silver miners. His 25-year campaign for a bimetallic standard made him a friend and advocate for agriculture and western miners. However, Bland was far more than a one-issue legislator. He frequently involved himself in debates on tariff issues, government bonds, and taxation of the citizenry. Bland strongly opposed Reconstruction Era electoral commissions and bitterly opposed the use of U.S. Marshals or Federal troops at polling places. In matters of foreign policy Bland was an anti-imperialist.\n\nHe was re-elected to the House ten times, narrowly defeated in 1894, regained his seat in 1896, was re-elected in 1898, and died in office in 1899. While a member of the House he was chairman of the Committee on Mines and Mining in the 44th Congress. Bland was chairman of the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures in the 48th Congress, 49th Congress, 50th Congress, 52nd Congress, and 53rd Congress.\n\nRichard Bland was a strong, if reluctant, candidate for United States President in 1896. He is quoted as saying \"\"I have no desire in this direction. I have no ambition for this nomination and I am afraid my friends, thrusting my personality into this contest may confuse the greater question.\"\". That question of course, like most tied to Bland, was currency and bimetalism. Rather than travel to the Democratic Convention in Chicago, Illinois Bland chose to remain on his 160-acre farm near Lebanon, Missouri as the political drama played out. At first the convention balloting seemed to be going Bland's way. He beat William Jennings Bryan 236 to 137 on the first ballot, 281 to 197 on the second, and 291 to 219 on the third. However, none were of the two-thirds margin to secure the nomination outright. By this time, the full impact of Bryan's Cross of Gold speech began to be felt and understood by the delegates. Bryan took the lead on the fourth ballot 280-241. Bland, not wishing to risk a split party, sent a telegram to his supporters in Chicago throwing his support behind Bryan saying \"Put the cause above the man.\" With that, the fifth ballot was a mere formality, with Bryan claiming a 652 to 11 victory. There still existed the possibility of Bland on the ticket as candidate for Vice-President. He trailed considerably behind on the first ballot, but gained steam to win the second and third balloting, although again by not enough margin to earn the nomination. Bland at this time, never enthralled with the idea in the first place, declined his name being considered in any further balloting, paving the way for Arthur Sewall to become Bryan's ticketmate.\n\nRichard P. Bland died at his home in Lebanon, Missouri on June 15, 1899. He had been in failing health for some years, and in the spring of 1899 returned to Lebanon from Washington, D.C. to recover from a severe throat infection, but his condition only worsened. He is buried in the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Lebanon, Missouri. A crowd of several thousand flocked to the small Missouri Ozarks town to attend Bland's funeral.\n\nRichard Bland married Virginia Elizabeth Mitchell of Rolla on December 19, 1873. Mrs. Bland was the daughter of Confederate General Ewing Young Mitchell. The couple had a total of nine children, six that were still living at the time of his death: Theodric, Ewing, Frances, John, George, and Virginia. The Blands marriage was somewhat unusual for the time period, he being Protestant and son of a trained Presbyterian minister, and she being Catholic. The children were raised in the Catholic faith, something which along with his marriage led to derision and bigotry by opponents during his 1896 bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Replying to critics, Bland stated \"\"Yes my wife is a Roman Catholic and I am a Protestant, and shall live and die one; but my regret is that I am not half such a Christian as the woman who bears my name and is the mother of my children.\"\"\n\nBland was a Freemason, a member of Lodge 231 in Rolla, Missouri. One of his siblings, brother Charles C. Bland, was also involved with the legal profession, eventually serving as a judge in the Missouri 18th Judicial Circuit. Bland's brother-in-law Ewing Young Mitchell, Jr., with his help became a U.S. Senate page in 1886 and would remain in politics throughout his life, eventually becoming assistant Secretary of Commerce under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nRichard P. Bland is the namesake of Bland, Missouri.\n\n\n"}

It was formerly part of the city of Nepean. It is a newer residential subdivision in the west/central part of Ottawa, developed from 1984 onwards, and is informally bounded by Baseline Road to the north, Woodroffe Avenue to the east, the CN railroad to the south, and the Briargreen subdivision to the west. The housing stock includes approximately 1,000 detached homes, with the remainder mostly townhomes (row houses) and terrace homes.\n\nAccording to the Canada 2011 Census, the neighbourhood had a total population of 7,523.\n\nPreviously farmland, it was purchased by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which let the land lay fallow for many years. Most of the land was sold off to Ottawa's largest housing developer Minto Group, which built and sold off a wide range of homes from townhouses to large upscale houses.\n\nIts major attraction is Ben Franklin Place, named for the former mayor of Nepean, which houses the Centrepointe Branch of the Ottawa Public Library, the locally renowned Centrepointe Theatre, and the former Nepean City Hall (now housing satellite offices for the City of Ottawa).\n\nThe neighbourhood has a significant Jewish population. The 2011 National Household Survey indicated that 13% of the neighbourhood's population was Jewish.\n\nThe Centrepointe Community Association was formed on February 4, 2006 to represent and advance the interests of neighbourhood residents. A major issue confronting the association is the City of Ottawa's proposed development of the Centrepointe Town Centre concept, which could add up to two million square feet of high density residential and commercial space to the area. Residential construction in Centrepointe continues. In 2007, a former snowdump next to Centrepointe Park was converted into approximately 260 townhouses, terrace homes and low-rise apartments, which was completed in early 2011. The Centrepointe Community Association has not been very active as of late; however, it does advertise a community garage sale each spring.\n\nAn Annual General Meeting at 7:00 PM on October 26, 2011 at Ben Franklin Place was held to discuss Richraft's new proposed development at the corner of Centrepointe Drive and Constellation Crescent. This particular piece of land was previously slated for development but the project never went ahead and is now under consideration by the builder, City of Ottawa and Community again.\n\nThe easternmost portion of Centrepointe underwent major development. As of January 2012, construction had finished on three major projects: the City of Ottawa Archives at the corner of Tallwood Drive and Woodroffe Avenue, a new trades building for nearby Algonquin College, and expansion of Centrepointe Theatre at Ben Franklin Place. Baseline Station Portions of Constellation Boulevard were rerouted to accommodate the new buildings and as part of the City's long-term public transportation plan.\n\nBaseline Station is expected to be the terminus of Stage 2 of the LRT's Confederation Line, to be completed in 2023.\nMany school-aged children attend Briargreen, Manordale, Knoxdale (French Immersion), Greenbank Middle School and then Sir Robert Borden High School.\n\n"}

For a brief period starting 1992, the name was changed to Haigazian University College before the institution adopted the present name in 1996. It offers programs leading to Bachelor's degrees in the Arts and Sciences as well as Business Administration and Economics, in addition to Master's degrees in the Arts, Sciences and Business Administration. English is the main language of instruction, although some courses are offered in Armenian and Arabic. All degrees from Haigazian are recognized by the Lebanese government and the Association of International Colleges and Universities. It is supported by the Armenian Evangelical community, and was established primarily to meet the needs of the large Lebanese-Armenian population. However, the university is open to all students, regardless of race, nationality, or creed, and has professors and student body from all sections of Lebanese society.\n\nHaigazian University is named in honor of Dr. Armenag Haigazian (), former headmaster of the Jenanian Apostolic Institute of Konya, Turkey. Dr. Haigazian was a highly respected educator who received his Ph.D. from Yale University and returned to Turkey to serve his Armenian compatriots. When the genocide of the Armenians began, Dr. Haigazian had the opportunity to escape to the United States, but he chose to stay and continue his ministry. Later, he, along with many Armenian intellectuals, was rounded up to be driven into the Syrian desert. Dr. Haigazian died on the way in the prison of Kharpert in 1921 (\"New York Times\" article).\nConcurrently, eight Armenian colleges were also destroyed in Turkey. Although these aspects of education and service were brought to an end, the dream continued in the minds of Dr. Haigazian's descendants and others. The Mehagian family (Mary Mehagian and Florence Mehagian-Guertmenian) of Phoenix, Arizona, close relatives of Dr. Haigazian, donated capital through the AMAA and worked hand in hand with Stephen Philibosian to get Haigazian College started.\nThe University was founded on October 17, 1955, by the Union of Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East (UAECNE) and the Armenian Missionary Association of America (AMAA) as a liberal arts college to assist in the preparation of teachers and pastors.\n\nPrior to this date, the Armenian Evangelical community of Beirut, to complement its high schools and the Teacher Training needs, had established two post-secondary educational programs: the Teacher's Training Institute, which was housed in the library of the Central High School and operated from 1948–51, and the Armenian Evangelical College, which held a Freshman Arts and Sciences program under the sponsorship of the First Armenian Evangelical Church of Beirut. These two entities merged in 1951 forming a Freshman Arts and Sciences plus a Sophomore Arts program, and they continued to serve the Armenian Community until 1955, when Haigazian College was established.\n\nHaigazian College was originally designed to function as a junior college offering two years of university-level education.

In 2003, Haigazian University started to use the whole seven floors of the south wing of the adjacent Armenian Evangelical College (AEC), according to a non-rent agreement between the administration and the AEC trustees.\n\nEmpowered by its newly acquired authorization from the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education to offer graduate programs, since 1995, the institution has started four M.A. programs: Educational Administration and Supervision, General Psychology, Clinical Psychology, and Masters in Business Administration.\n\n\n\nHaigazian University has the following publications:\n\nThe Lebanese Rocket Society which was led by Manoug Manougian and consisted a small group of students from the Haigazian University. The society developed into the wider Lebanese space program and it produced the first rockets of the Arab World, which were capable of suborbital flight.\n\nIn November 1960, a group of Haigazian College students got together under the guidance of Manoug Manougian (a Math and Physics instructor) to form the Haigazian College Rocket Society (HCRS).\n\nAspects of the first single-stage rocket were assigned to each student. As a result of the lack of required equipment, the group was obliged to resort to flight testing without any fuel tests in the laboratories. After a number of failures, the project was crowned with success.\n\nIn April 1961, a single-stage solid propellant rocket was Launched and reached an altitude of about one kilometer. With further improvements of the solid fuel system, a similar rocket called HCRS-3 was Launched all the way up to 2 000 m.\n\nThe Lebanese President, Fouad Chehab, as a result of these experiments, met with the members of HCRS and granted financial assistance for the project (10 thousand LL for 1961 and 15 thousand LL for 1962).\n\nDuring the academic year 1961-1962, the society worked on two-stage rockets with further improvements of the separation system, solid fuel system, and vehicle design. On May 25, 1962, HCRS-7 Cedar was Launched up to 11,500 m, and the Lebanese Army was responsible for the security of the launch. In the summer of 1962, two more rockets, Cedar ll B and Cedar ll c, Were Launched to a distance of 20 km.\n\nDue to the successes of the HCRS new members joined and a new group was formed in 1962, it was called the Lebanese Rocket Society (LRS).\n\nThe LRS was directed by a main committee of six members: Mr. M. Manougian of Haigazian College (Director), Dr. P. Mourad of AUB (advisor), Mr. Karamanougian of Haigazian college, Mr.J. Sfeir (Electronic engineer), Mr, E. Kai (Engineer geodesist), and an officer expert in ballistics (granted by the Army). Further tests were planned on design and construction of multistage rockets. Mr. Hart supervised the works of the HCRS while Mr. Manougian was in the U.S.A. Members of the HCRS at the College were: Hampartzum Karaguezian, Hrair Aintablian, Hrair Sahagian, Jirair Zenian, and Jean Jack Guvlekjian.\n\nOn November 21, 1962 Cedar-3, a three-stage solid propellant rocket prepared by the Haigazian group was launched. It had a length of 6.80 m and weight of 1250 kg.\n\nAfter several other launchings, an accident occurred during the summer of 1964, which hospitalized 2 students, who later recovered. However, the launchings were ended then, and no \"big bang\" has taken place since. The outcome of these experiments was not a Haigazian student walking on the moon, but more students walking into Haigazian's admissions office. One has to realize that nowadays, after the Lebanese civil wars, the idea of a rocket is not very pleasing, but back in the 1960s when both the U.S.and the U.S.S.R. were trying to reach the moon, Haigazian College was also on track.\n\nA reproduction of a 1964 postage stamp produced by the Lebanese postal service to commemorate the 21st anniversary of Lebanese Independence.

During his playing career he played as a defender in Canada and England, most notably with Bristol City, Nottingham Forest, Norwich City (where he won the 2003–04 Football League First Division) and Toronto FC.\n\nHe also earned 49 caps for the Canadian national team, was member of the Canada side which won the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and later represented his country at the Confederations Cup 2001, the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He was inducted into the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame in November 2015.\n\nA left-sided defender who also has played the left side of the midfield, Brennan grew up in Newmarket, Ontario, and started playing with Bristol City youth team in 1994 and made his professional debut in 1996 with Bristol City against cross town rivals Bristol Rovers in the Football League First Division. In 5 years Brennan had five managers including Russell Osman, Benny Lennartsson, Joe Jordan, John Ward and Tony Pulis. In 64 first-team appearances for City over five seasons, Brennan scored three goals. Brennan started his career in the Bristol City youth team and worked his way into the first team before being sold to Nottingham Forest.\n\nBrennan joined Nottingham Forest for £1.5 million in October 1999 and was bought by ex-England captain David Platt. Brennan was the first Canadian-born player to be sold over the 1 million pound mark. In 146 games played with Forest over four seasons under David Platt and Paul Hart, Brennan scored just once, in a 4–0 victory against Norwich City, the team he would later go on to sign for. While he was recovering from a double hernia he had a short loan spell at Huddersfield with his old manager Joe Jordan. He also came on as a substitute in two league games while on loan to Huddersfield in 2000–01 and received a red card against Birmingham City and headed back to Forest.\n\nBrennan joined Norwich City on a free Bosman transfer in 2003 and was managed by Nigel Worthington. During the 2003–04 season in Division One of the Football League, Brennan scored twice in just nine appearances, as he battled an abductor muscle injury. His goals came against Everton in the FA Cup and Coventry City in the league. Despite his personal struggles with fitness, the season saw Norwich win the First Division title and promotion back to the Premier League. Brennan became the first Canadian born outfield player to play in the Premier League.\n\nBrennan joined George Burley at Southampton on 27 January 2006 with his contract due to expire in summer having failed to make an impact on the Norwich first team after a series of injuries. However, after finishing his contract he left the club the following May and departed England to play for his hometown team Toronto FC.\n\nOn 8 September 2006, Brennan signed with MLS team Toronto FC for the 2007 season, becoming the first player and captain in club history. Brennan remained captain under Mo Johnston, John Carver, Chris Cummins and Preki. He also became the first Canadian to score for Toronto FC, registering a goal off a free kick against the Columbus Crew on 26 May 2007. This goal subsequently became a Sierra Mist Goal of the Week. Brennan went on to play 27 games, all of them starts, for Toronto FC, the most of any player. He earned a reputation as Toronto's \"Iron Man,\" as he managed to play many of his games despite a rib injury, and looked as though he would go on to play every match of the season. Unfortunately, a knee injury prevented Brennan from achieving this feat. Brennan retained the captaincy for the 2008 season, and nearly managed to score in his team's opening match. Brennan has since added goals in 2008 against Chivas USA in Carson, California and to open the 2009 season at Kansas City, off pass from newly acquired Canadian international teammate Dwayne De Rosario.\n\nBrennan also made an appearance during the 2008 MLS All-Star game in his home stadium, BMO Field. The MLS All-Stars won the game 3–2 against West Ham United. On 6 April 2010 Brennan retired as player to become the assistant general manager for Toronto FC.\n\nBrennan played at the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan, in a team alongside Paul Stalteri and Jason Bent.

Brennan won a Gold medal in the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup defeating Colombia and Bronze medal in the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup defeating South Korea.\n\nFollowing Brennan's retirement, Toronto FC named him assistant general manager to Mo Johnston. However following the firing of Johnston in the late 2010 season, Brennan's position remained unknown with the club until the new management team was put in place. It included Paul Mariner as Director of Player Development and Aron Winter as head coach. On 1 March 2011, the club announced that the new position of Brennan within the club would be as head coach of the Toronto FC Academy U-17 team in the Second Division of the Canadian Soccer League; his first coaching position.\n\nOn 14 May 2012, Brennan was promoted to first-team assistant coach under Aron Winter. On 28 September 2013, Brennan filled in for Toronto FC head coach Ryan Nelsen who was serving a suspension. In August 2014, Brennan was fired along with Nelsen and the rest of the club's first-team staff.\n\nIn March 2015, Brennan became the executive director and director of soccer operations at Aurora FC.

He received his juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1974.\n\nBefore his service as the University of Rochester's president, Seligman served as the dean and Ethan A.H. Shepley University Professor at the Washington University School of Law. Prior to serving there, Seligman was the dean and Samuel M. Fegtly Professor of Law at the University of Arizona College of Law (1995–1999). He also held professorships at the University of Michigan Law School (1987–1995), George Washington University Law School (1983–1986), and Northeastern University School of Law (1977–1983).\n\nIn addition to being an academic leader, Seligman is considered a leading authority on securities law. He is the author or coauthor of 20 books and over 40 articles on legal issues related to securities and corporations including the eleven-volume \"Securities Regulation\", the leading treatise in the field (cowritten with Troy Paredes and the late Louis Loss); \"The Transformation of Wall Street: A History of the Securities and Exchange Commission\"; and \"Modern Corporate Finance\".\n\nOn September 1, 2017, a complaint was filed by eight current and former faculty members of the University of Rochester with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The complaint includes allegations of sexual misconduct/harassment perpetrated by a current University of Rochester faculty member, and reprisals by the Seligman administration against the complainants. The university responded publicly that the allegations were \"thoroughly investigated and could not be substantiated,\" with Seligman personally responding that \"no violation of the law or University policy was found,\" and that \" [a]llegations are not facts.\" Seligman also wrote that \"as we saw in Rolling Stone's withdrawn story about sexual assault at the University of Virginia, even established media outlets can get it wrong,\" a statement for which Seligman later apologized.\nThe public disclosure of the EEOC filing, and the responses to it from the University and Seligman, resulted in a contentious on-campus Town Hall meeting hosted by Seligman, with approximately 500 University students, faculty, and staff attending. Subsequent to this meeting an on-campus rally was held, protesting against the responses of the University and Seligman to the allegations of sexual harassment and reprisals made in the EEOC-filed complaint.\n\nSeligman resigned as the President and CEO of the University of Rochester on February 28, 2018, subsequent to the release of a report on the University's EEOC case by Debevoise & Plimpton, and amid the growing perception among students and faculty of a failure in leadership.\n\nSeligman is currently a member of the board of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In 2009 he was found guilty of corruptly receiving secret commissions during his time in office and jailed for seven years. In 2010, he was found guilty of five charges of official corruption and five charges of perjury and, ultimately, jailed for an additional seven years, the longest jail term for corruption handed to a Commonwealth politician. He was released on parole in July 2015.\n\nNuttall won the seat of Sandgate at the 1992 state election as the Labor candidate, succeeding the retiring former Labor Opposition leader, Nev Warburton. He was previously an organiser for the Electrical Trades Union.\n\nHe served in the Beattie Ministry as:\n\n\nIn 2004 he attempted to become Deputy Premier with a plan to overthrow the Premier at the time, Peter Beattie.\nHowever, a leadership challenge received no support from then Deputy Premier Anna Bligh, whom Nuttall proposed as the new Premier. Ms Bligh later said, \"I didn't see it as any serious proposition that would have received any support from my colleagues and it didn't receive any support from myself.\"\n\nIn July 2005, he resigned as Minister for Health following media exposure of problems at Bundaberg Base Hospital. In June 2010, following a number of investigations, the hospital's director of surgery, Jayant Patel, was convicted and jailed for seven years on three counts of manslaughter and one count of grievous bodily harm to patients in his care. Nuttall blamed the system he had inherited as well as the administrators at the hospital for the situation which had arisen, but ultimately stepped down from the health portfolio. Premier Peter Beattie opted to take over the portfolio himself, relocating Nuttall to the primary industries and fisheries portfolio.\n\nIn August 2005, Nuttall stepped aside from the Ministry while the Crime and Misconduct Commission (CMC) investigated claims he had given a false answer to a Parliamentary estimates committee regarding his prior knowledge of problems with overseas-trained doctors. The Commission reported back in December 2005, recommending the Attorney-General prosecute Nuttall under section 57 of the Criminal Code. The prosecution was not proceeded with; the government decided to revoke the relevant section of the Criminal Code so Parliament could deal with such matters itself under contempt of parliament provisions.\n\nNuttall resigned from the Ministry on 7 December 2005 and retired from Parliament at the September 2006 election. He resigned from the Labor Party on 12 December 2006 before he was referred to the party's Disputes Tribunal, which could have expelled him.\n\nIn 2006 the CMC also began an investigation into a series of loans Nuttall received from Queensland mining magnate Ken Talbot. On 19 January 2007, the CMC charged Nuttall with 35 counts of corruptly receiving payments totalling almost $300,000 from Talbot between 2002 and 2005. Nuttall was later charged with receiving a further secret commission of $60,000 in 2002 from businessman and WorkCover Queensland director Harold Shand. Talbot and Shand were also charged over the alleged secret commissions.\n\nNuttall was committed to stand trial in December 2008. In June 2009, he pleaded not guilty to all charges before the District Court.

On 23 March 2010, his appeal against conviction was dismissed, and his application for leave to appeal against sentence was refused.\n\nIn August 2010, the charges against Talbot were dropped due to his death in a light plane accident. In 2011, Shand was convicted of paying Nuttall a secret commission and sentenced to 15 months jail.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, the CMC recommended 10 new charges relating to alleged secret cash payments to Nuttall totalling $152,700 from businessman Brendan McKennariey, between December 2001 and April 2006, regarding a government-funded project subcontracted to McKennariey. Nuttall was also charged with five counts of perjury relating to his evidence at a CMC closed hearing.\n\nOn 11 October 2010, in the Brisbane District Court, Nuttall pleaded not guilty to five charges of official corruption, five alternate charges of receiving secret commissions and five counts of perjury. On 12 October 2010, McKennariey gave evidence for the Crown. On 27 October 2010, a jury found Nuttall guilty of five charges of official corruption and five charges of perjury. On 16 December 2010, he was sentenced to a further five years imprisonment. On 17 January 2011, the Queensland Government announced it would appeal the \"inadequacy\" of the sentence. The appeal was heard in the Queensland Court of Appeal on 10 May 2011. On 7 June 2011, the appeal was upheld and an extra two years jail was handed down, extending his non-parole period to July 2015.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, Nuttall was brought before the \"bar of parliament\" to answer 41 charges of contempt of parliament for non-disclosure, as a member of parliament, of pecuniary interests totalling $368,866.55. Parliament found him to have been contemptuous and fined him $82,000.\n\nOn 24 September 2009, the CMC commenced actions in the Supreme Court of Queensland under Queensland's \"Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002\" to seize a property owned by Nuttall at Woodgate, near Bundaberg, having already initiated action to seize another property at Sandgate. On 12 July 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Nuttall to repay $454,000 deemed to be \"proceeds of crime\" to the state of Queensland and also ordered him to pay the Government's legal costs of $42,000. The legal principle for the property seizure is known colloquially as the proceeds of crime.

The film starred an ensemble cast of Sachin Khedekar, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Rajit Kapur, Arif Zakaria, and Divya Dutta, among others. The film depicts the life of the Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose in Nazi Germany: 1941–1943, and In Japanese-occupied Asia 1943–1945, and the events leading to the formation of Azad Hind Fauj. \n\nThe production design was helmed by Samir Chanda, with soundtrack, and background score by A. R. Rahman, Upon release, the film received wide critical acclaim at the BFI London Film Festival, and has garnered the National Film Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, and the National Film Award for Best Production Design for that year. The film was screened retrospective on August 14th 2016 at the \"Independence Day Film Festival\" jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defense, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day.\n\nSet up in British Raj, after a political disagreement with Mahatma Gandhi, Bose's arrest and subsequent release sets the scene for his escape to Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. On the night of his escape, he dresses himself as a Pathan to avoid being identified. Bose escapes from under British surveillance at his house in Calcutta on 19 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir K. Bose in a car.\n\nBose journeys to Peshawar with the help of the Abwehr, where he was met by Akbar Shah, Mohammed Shah and Bhagat Ram Talwar. Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan, a trusted friend of Akbar Shah's. On 26 January 1941, Bose begins his journey to reach Russia through British India's North West frontier with Afghanistan. For this reason, he enlists the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a Forward Bloc leader in the North-West Frontier Province. Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union, and suggests a novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak one word of Pashto, it would make him an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggests that Bose act deaf and dumb, and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen. Bose's guide Bhagat Ram Talwar, unknown to him, is actually a Soviet agent.\n\nSupporters of the Aga Khan III help Bose across the border into Afghanistan where he was met by an Abwehr unit posing as a party of road construction engineers from the Organization Todt who then aided his passage across Afghanistan via Kabul to the border with Soviet Russia. After assuming the disguise of a Pashtun insurance agent (\"Ziaudddin\") to reach Afghanistan, Bose changes his disguise and travels to Moscow on the Italian passport of an Italian nobleman \"Count Orlando Mazzotta\". From Moscow, he reached Rome, and from there he travels to Germany. Once in Russia the NKVD transport Bose to Moscow where he hope that Russia's traditional enmity to British rule in India would result in support for his plans for a popular rising in India. However, Bose found the Soviets' response disappointing and was rapidly passed over to the German Ambassador in Moscow, Count von der Schulenburg. He had Bose flown on to Berlin in a special courier aircraft at the beginning of April where he was to receive a more favorable hearing from Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Foreign Ministry officials at the Wilhelmstrasse.\n\nIn Germany, Bose is attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio. Bose initiates the Free India Center in Berlin, and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces. The Indian Legion is attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS.\n\nIts members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: \"I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose\". This oath clearly abrogates control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India. He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many question his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.\n\nIn all, 3,000 Indian prisoners of war sign up for the Free India Legion. But instead of being delighted, Bose was worried. An admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler's tanks rolled across the Soviet border. Matters were worsened by the fact that the now-retreating German army would be in no position to offer him help in driving the British from India. When he meets Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, and he comes to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military ones. So, in February 1943, Bose turned his back on his legionnaires and slipped secretly away aboard a submarine bound for Japan. This leaves the men he had recruited leaderless and demoralized in Germany.\n\nBose lives in Berlin from 1941 until 1943. During his earlier visit to Germany in 1934, he had met Emilie Schenkl, the daughter of an Austrian veterinarian whom he marries in 1937. Their daughter is Anita Bose Pfaff. In 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, he leaves for Japan. He travels with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he is transferred to the for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan, The INA's first commitment was in the Japanese thrust towards Eastern Indian frontiers of Manipur. INA's special forces, the Bahadur Group, are extensively involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary attacks in Arakan, as well as the Japanese thrust towards Imphal and Kohima, along with the Burmese National Army led by Ba Maw and Aung San.\n\nHowever, the Japanese Navy remains in essential control of the island's administration. On the Indian mainland, an Indian Tricolor, modeled after that of the Indian National Congress, was raised for the first time in the town in Moirang, in Manipur, in north-eastern India. The towns of Kohima and Imphal were placed under siege by divisions of the Japanese, Burmese National Army and the Gandhi and Nehru Brigades of INA during the attempted invasion of India, also known as Operation U-GO. However, Commonwealth forces held both positions and then counter-attack, in the process inflicting serious losses on the besieging forces, which were then forced to retreat back into Burma.\n\nWhen the Japanese were defeated at the battles of Kohima and Imphal, the Provisional Government's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever. The INA was forced to pull back, along with the retreating Japanese army, and fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in its Burma campaign, notable in Meiktilla, Mandalay, Pegu, Nyangyu and Mount Popa. However, with the fall of Rangoon, Bose's government ceases to be an effective political entity. A large proportion of the INA troops surrenders under Lt Col Loganathan. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand. Japan's surrender at the end of the war also leads to the eventual surrender of the Indian National Army, when the troops of the British Indian Army were repatriated to India. On 17 August 1945, Bose leaves from Saigon to Tourane, French Indo-China in the Mitsubishi Ki-21 twin-engine heavy bomber. Subsequently, on 23 August 1945, Reuters announces the death of Bose and General Tsunamasa Shidei of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The film ends with the trial of INA war heroes at Red Fort, Indian Navy rebellion, and the resulting Indian Independence in 1947.\n\n\"Bose: The Forgotten Hero\", which offered a controversial view of the life of Bose, sparked protest in India. Director Benegal was forced to cancel its premiere in Calcutta. The film was fiercely opposed by the Forward Bloc party. The party was angry at the film's suggestion that Bose secretly married an Austrian woman, Emilie Schenkl, in 1937, and that he died in a plane crash in Taiwan rather than fleeing to Russia in 1945 as some people believe.\n\nBBC gave 3 stars out of 5 for \"Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero\". Critic Jaspreet Pandohar called it \"an informative and fascinating lesson worth sitting through\" and \"an absorbing drama.\" \"Benegal is best known for his intimate portraits of Indian women, so it comes as some surprise that his latest film is a biopic of one of India's most famous male icons, Subhas Chandra Bose. Benegal ensures Bose's amazing but complex life story is peppered with just the right amount of detail so as to be easily understood. But what stops this film from becoming a [box-office] hit is its marathon length. At nearly three and a half hours, Sachin Khedekar's gallant performance isn't enough to make this a rousing affair,\" Pandohar wrote in his analysis.\n\nSachin Khedekar's portrayal of Bose was praised by critics including Ziya us-Salam of \"The Hindu\" newspaper. \"Khedekar may not win too many international awards for portraying Bose but accolades in India should come in thick and fast,\" she wrote in her review. \"Benegal may not have put together an epic to challenge the lasting greatness of \"Gandhi,\" Richard Attenborough's tribute to our father of the nation. But nor has he had the advantage of such resources. Where Benegal deserves credit is not in the canvas of his work but the intellectual honesty he has brought to the film. He refrains from either diluting or distorting history to serve his ends.\" Salam also noted the limitations of a director working under a relatively small budget for a historical film.\n\nThe highly acclaimed music score that accompanies the film was composed by A. R. Rahman. The soundtrack features 20 pieces composed by Rahman, including 12 instrumentals and orchestral themes, six songs with lyrics by Javed Akhtar and a full orchestral version of Indian National Anthem. Most of the score was conducted by Matt Dunkley and performed by Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. Performers include the Western Choir Chennai (for \"Aazadi\") and the Mumbai Film Choir (\"Hum Dilli Dilli Jayenge\").\n\nThe soundtrack got high critical acclaim. A. R. Rahman received unanimous positive appreciations for his work. Popular music reviewing website \"Planet Bollywood\" gave 10 out of 10 stating \"Bose – The Forgotten Hero is one of A.R. Rahman's and Javed Akhtar's finest creations. It's [sic] lack of mainstream compatibility and item numbers may hinder it from topping tabloid music charts, but that is barely a price to pay for having the distinction of creating musical storytelling of such high caliber. With three creative geniuses (A.R. Rahman, Javed Akhtar, and Shyam Benegal) at work, this quality soundtrack promises a very exciting movie to watch out for.\" Another popular review website \"nowrunning\" gave a positive review stating \"The entire album is created for a patriotic, period film and is totally different from the regular film albums that one hears nowadays. It is always a difficult task to write songs that can cause one's patriotism to surge and flow. To his credit, it must be said that Rahman has succeeded in this and is ably aided by some wonderful lyrics by Javed Saab. As usual, Rahman has used original compositions to enhance the value of original songs and words used by the Indian National Army, way back in the 40s. A good album, but one that may not get popular acclaim but will definitely appeal to a niche audience.\"\n\nThe soundtrack is considered one of Rahman's finest works and was particularly praised for grand orchestration.\n\n\n\n"}

Prince-Bishop Petar II Petrović Njegoš wore it with a black rim (called \"derevija\"), and the definition given was as a sign of grief of occupied Kosovo. The Kosovo Myth was very popular in Montenegro. The enforcement of the cap upon the Montenegrin chieftains by Prince-Bishop Petar II was a mark of expression of then's dominating Serbian national identity.\n\nThe national telling recorded the most often version of the cap as following: the black wrapper was a sign of grief for their once great Serbian Empire, the red the symbol of spilled blood at the Battle of Kosovo and the five small stripes on the top represent the remaining remains of the once great Serbian realm, which became increasingly popular amongst the common folk during the reign of Prince Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš. Within the stripes is angled a six star, representing the last free part, Montenegro, shining upon the fallen and conquered.\n\nDuring the Communist era in the second half of the 20th century instead of the Serb cross the Communist Red Star was implanted between the golden stripes, although it was not spread amongst the people and never accepted. Several years ago a new version appeared with a large modern (2004) Coat of Arms of Montenegro spread across the cap's red top, that is becoming increasingly popular as a sign of the Montenegrin nation's independence and sovereignty. A female version of the cap was introduced, so far worn almost exclusively by men.\n\nMontenegrin cap has a history of three hundred years. Artwork from 1754 with portrait of Montenegrin from Paštrovići is the oldest presentation of Montenegrin cap, only difference is that Paštrovići cap is all in black color. It is assumed that the cap from Paštrovići ie Montenegrin cap has pattern in Venetian cap. The first presentation of the cap in two-color variant (black and red) is find on aquarelle from 1782. Josef Holeček on his journey through Montenegro in 1876 described the cap and recorded that Montenegrin cap has motif of Montenegrin eagle.\n\n"}

In the 11th century it became a possession of Boniface of Canossa, marquis of Toscana. The last ruler of the family was the countess Matilde of Canossa (died 1115), who, according to legend, ordered the construction of the precious Rotonda di San Lorenzo (1082).

His family ruled Mantua for the next century, making it more prosperous and artistically beautiful.\n\nOn 16 August 1328, the last Bonacolsi, Rinaldo, was overthrown in a revolt backed by the House of Gonzaga, a family of officials, namely the 60-year-old Luis and his sons Guy, Filippino and Feltrino.

The Gonzaga built new walls with five gates and renovated the architecture of the city in the 14th century, but the political situation in the city did not settle until Ludovico II eliminated his relatives, seizing power for himself in 1370.\n\nThrough a payment of 120,000 golden florins in 1433, Gianfrancesco was appointed marquis of Mantua by Emperor Sigismund, whose niece Barbara of Brandenburg he married. In 1459 Pope Pius II held a diet in Mantua to proclaim a crusade against the Turks.\n\nThe first Duke of Mantua was Federico II, who acquired the title from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530. The following year, the family acquired the Marquisate of Montferrat through marriage. Federico commissioned Giulio Romano to build the famous Palazzo Te, in the periphery of the city, and profoundly improved the urbanistic assets of the city.\n\nIn 1624, Ferdinando Gonzaga moved the ducal seat to a new residence, the Villa della Favorita, designed by the architect Nicolò Sebregondi.\n\nIn 1627, the direct line of the Gonzaga family came to an end with the vicious and weak Vincenzo II, and the town slowly declined under the new rulers, the Gonzaga Nevers, a cadet French branch of the family. The War of the Mantuan Succession broke out, and in 1630 an Imperial army of 36,000 Landsknecht mercenaries besieged Mantua, bringing the plague with them. Mantua never recovered from this disaster.\n\nDuke Ferdinand Charles, an inept ruler whose only aim was to hold parties and theatrical representations, allied with France in the War of the Spanish Succession. After the latter's defeat, he was declared deposed by Emperor Joseph I and took refuge in Venice, carrying with him a thousand pictures. At his death, in 1708 his family lost Mantua forever in favour of the Habsburgs of Austria. Montferrat's territories were ceded to the Duke of Savoy, and the emperor compensated the Duke of Lorraine, heir in female line of the Gonzaga, for the loss of Montferrat by ceding him the Duchy of Teschen. The Gonzagas of the Duchy of Guastalla were passed over entirely despite having the strongest claim, themselves dying out in 1746, marking the end of the Gonzaga family.\n\nMantua was briefly united with the Duchy of Milan by an edict of Emperor Joseph II on 26 September 1786 but later restored in its separated administration by Emperor Leopold II on 24 January 1791. Mantua was besieged by Napoleon's French army in 1796, before falling in 1797. With the Treaty of Campo Formio, Mantua was annexed to the Cisalpine Republic becoming the Department of Mincio.\n\n\n"}

In recent times, it is increasingly often placed in the genus \"Turdus\" again, however some taxonomists place this species in the genus \"Platycichla\" based on morphology. The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithologists' Union places it in the genus \"Turdus\", as does the International Ornithological Committee.\n\nThis thrush is long and weighs . Both sexes have yellow legs and eye-ring. The male has a yellow bill and its plumage is usually black with a slate-grey back and lower underparts. However, the hue of the grey areas varies, and the male of one of the five subspecies, \"P. f. xanthoscelus\" of Tobago, is all-black, resembling the male Eurasian blackbird (\"Turdus merula\"). Females have a dull bill, warm brown upperparts and paler underparts. The juvenile male is brownish with black wings and tail, while the juvenile female resemble the adult female, but is duller, flecked with orange above and spotted and barred with dark brown below.\n\nThe song of the male is musical phrases, \"sreep, sreee, sree, sreee\", again somewhat resembling that of the Eurasian blackbird, but sometimes including some imitation of other birds songs. The typical call is a sharp \"srip\" and a peculiar \"seeet\" given in alarm.\n\nIt has a highly disjunct distribution. One population breeds in northern Colombia, Venezuela, far northern Brazil, Trinidad, and Tobago, as well as parts of the Pakaraima Mountains in western Guyana (including as it seems Mount Roraima). A second population occurs in eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, and far northeastern Argentina. The Argentine subpopulation is partially migratory, being resident in the northern part, while southernmost breeders spend the Austral winter further north. Some populations in northern South America also take part in local movements, but these are not well understood.\n\nThe habitat of this small thrush is rainforest, secondary woodland, and overgrown plantations. It is mainly a species of highlands up to ASL, but locally it occurs down to near sea level. The yellow-legged thrush mainly feeds in trees and bushes, infrequently on the ground, and mostly eats fruits and berries, e.g., Melastomataceae. It rarely if ever attends mixed-species feeding flocks, as its habit of keeping to the tree-tops makes it rarely worthwhile to join such conspicuous groups.\n\nThe nest is a lined shallow cup of twigs on a bank or amongst rocks. Two or three reddish-blotched green or blue eggs are laid.\n\nIt is fairly common in most of its range, and therefore listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. However, the yellow-legged thrush is a shy species, and the female in particular is difficult to see, since she does not sing and has a cryptic coloration.\n\n"}

{"id": "1793862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793862", "title": "Overbrook, Philadelphia", "text": "Overbrook, Philadelphia\n\nOverbrook is a neighborhood northwest of West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The area's housing ranges from large, old homes to rowhouses to 3- and 4-story apartment buildings.\n\nThe name Overbrook is commonly used to refer both to a specific neighborhood and a larger area of northwestern West Philadelphia that includes four Philadelphia City Planning Commission neighborhoods: Overbrook, Overbrook Farms, Morris Park and Overbrook Park. These four neighborhoods are united by the close proximity of Overbrook High School, the Overbrook School for the Blind, the Overbrook SEPTA Station, and Overbrook Avenue. Depending on the definition of Overbrook Farms, The Overbrook School for the Blind either lies partially in Morris Park and partially in Overbrook Farms or entirely in Morris Park.\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, the main boundaries for the Overbrook neighborhood are North 63rd Street to the west, Lansdowne Avenue to the south, and the SEPTA regional rail tracks to the northeast. A very small portion of Woodbine Avenue between North 63rd Street and the SEPTA regional rail tracks bounds Overbrook to the north while a very small portion of North 52nd Street between Lansdowne Avenue and the SEPTA regional rail tracks bounds Overbrook to the south.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the northern boundary of Overbrook Farms is City Avenue (US 1). The western boundary is North 66th Street between City Avenue and Woodcrest Avenue and Morris Park between Woodcrest Avenue and Malvern Avenue. The southern border is Malvern Avenue to Wynnewood Road, a small portion of Wynnewood Road, and Woodbine Avenue from Wynnewood Road to North 58th Street. The eastern boundary is North 58th Street between Woodbine Avenue and Overbrook Avenue, a small portion of Overbrook Avenue, and then Cardinal Avenue between Overbrook Avenue and City Avenue. Overbrook Farms borders Saint Joseph's University on its northeast corner. Although the Philadelphia City Planning Commission considers Malvern Avenue to form part of the southern border, the Overbrook Farms Club says, \"At present, there are 413 buildings in Overbrook Farms, which is bounded by 58th and 66th Streets and Woodbine and City Avenues, and bisected by Lancaster Avenue\". \n\nWest of the Overbrook neighborhood is Morris Park, which derives its name from the eponymous park on the neighborhood’s western edge. The eastern boundary of the neighborhood is North 63rd Street. On the north, the boundary is Woodbine Avenue between North 63rd Street and Wynnewood Road, Wynnewood Road between Woodbine Avenue and Malvern Avenue, and Malvern Avenue between Wynnewood Road and North 68th Street. On the west, the boundary is North 68th Street and Morris Park between Malvern Avenue and Haverford Avenue, Cobbs Creek Park between Haverford Avenue and North 67th Street, and North 67th Street between Callowhill Street and North Gross Street. The southern border is Arch Street at North Gross Street, bordering Cobbs Creek Park at Upper Darby's border. \n\nOverbrook Park's boundaries are City Avenue to the north and Morris Park on the west, south, and east. Haverford Avenue connects Overbrook Park to the Morris Park neighborhood while City Avenue connects Overbrook Park to Overbrook Farms. Greater Overbrook is in the Fourth Councilmanic District of Philadelphia, represented by Councilman Curtis Jones, Jr., elected on October 10, 2006 to a first term. The 19th Police District of the Philadelphia Police Department protects Overbrook.\n\nOverbrook developed in various stages between 1900 and 1960. The dominant housing type is the row house, present in a wide variety of styles. Built in the early 20th century when trolley lines were allowing middle-class Philadelphians to move out from more crowded row house communities, Overbrook was a community of choice when it was built. Outside of Overbrook Farms, most of the houses in the Overbrook area date from between 1915 and 1930, when the Great Depression halted new construction nationally and locally. In addition to rowhouses, one can find a sizeable number of twin (semi-detached) houses. These semi-detached homes have two or three floors and typically are over in size. Prime examples of typical Overbrook twin houses are along Wynnewood Road from Haverford Avenue to Malvern Avenue, North 64th Street between Lansdowne and Lebanon Avenues, or Nassau Road between North 61st and 63rd Streets. There are very few detached single-family homes in Overbrook. Single homes typically pre-date the construction of most of Overbrook’s housing or came into existence on select lots after the construction of most of the rowhouses and twin houses. For example, one will see a few single-family homes on Wynnewood Road near Columbia Avenue. A large stone home remains this intersection. This home once sat on acres of land that the owner(s) sold off to developers who then constructed twin houses and rowhouses. The vast majority of the single-family, detached homes in the Overbrook area are in the Overbrook Farms neighborhood.\n\nOverbrook, while overwhelmingly residential in character, does have several notable landmark buildings and institutions\n\nOverbrook High School is located in Overbrook.\n\nThe Free Library of Philadelphia Haddington Branch serves Overbrook-Morris Park.\n\nSaint Joseph's University is located nearby.\n\nOverbrook School for the Blind\n\nEntertainer Will Smith, who attended Overbrook High School, named his production company, Overbrook Entertainment, after the neighborhood.\n\n"}

The church was constructed between 1747 and 1754, to a design by the Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli. It is sometimes referred to as a cathedral. The church is part of the National Sanctuary \"Sophia of Kyiv\" as a landmark of cultural heritage.\n\nThe church has no bells, as according to legend, their noise would cause flooding of the left part of the city.\n\nSt Andrew's Church overlooks the historic Podil neighborhood, situated on a steep hill to which the church gave its current name—Andriyivska Hill. It is currently one of four architectural landmarks of Ukraine, which were put down on the List of Mankind Treasures of Five Continents by the world society.\n\nAs the church sits atop a hill, foundation problems have been one of the main concerns of preservationists. More recently, the foundation below the church has started to shift, causing some concerns that the church's foundation might collapse. Cracks have already appeared in the foundation, and some of the church's falling decor has been found in neighboring areas.\n\nThe church was built in honor of Saint Andrew who is recognized as the \"Apostle Rus\". According to the chronicle \"The Tale of Bygone Years\", Saint Andrew came to the Dnipro River's slopes in the 1st century AD and erected a cross on the current location of the church. He prophesied that the sparsely inhabited area would become a great city. As he predicted, the site arose to become the city of Kyiv, a center of the Eastern Orthodox faith.\n\nIn 1086, the Grand Prince of Kiev Vsevolod I constructed a small church, dedicated to the erection of the cross by Saint Andrew. In 1215, Prince Mstyslav of Halych built the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross nearby. However, the church did not survive after the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' in 1240. From that point after, wooden churches were constructed in the place where the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross had been located, although, were too destroyed and again replaced with another one.\n\nIn 1690, a wooden church consecrated to Saint Andrew was moved from the Brethren's cloister in the Podil to the Andriyivsky Mount. It too did not last long, only until 1726, when it was pulled down.\n\nThe current structure of the church began when Russian Empress Elizabeth decided to construct a summer residence for herself in Kyiv, consisting of a palace and a church. The palace was to be located in the Pechersk neighborhood while the church was to be on the Andriyivska Hill. The commencement of construction took place during an official ceremony on September 9, 1744 which consisted of the Empress laying the first three founding stones herself.\n\nThe Petersburg Building Chancellery first hired German architect Gottfried Johann Schädel and engineer Daniel de Bosquet to draft out the plans for the church. However, when Schädel presented his project in 1745, the Chancellery rejected it. He was replaced by head architect of the imperial court, Bartolomeo Rastrelli, who worked out a plan which was closely based on a church of a Saint Petersburg institute.\nThe construction itself was conducted by a team of Ukrainian, Russian, and foreign masters under the direction of architect Ivan Michurin, who was previously successful in replacing the older Church of the Resurrection, on the Women's Market Square (\"Babiy torzhok\") in Moscow. Michurin was responsible for carrying out all of the engineering and geological researches of the site and found out that a hard subsoil ground lies at a depth of 13–14 meters and above — made grounds penetrated by subterranean waters. With this information, Michurin developed the construction of a stone foundation and connected it with the two-storied building of the Priest's apartments, planned by Rastrelli.\n\nI. Vlasiev and the Kyiv Governor-General M. Leontev were placed in charge of hiring masons, carpenters, and carvers from territories now located in Belarus, Lithuania, and Ukraine. White and red bricks for the church were made at the brick fields of the Sophia, Pechersk, and Cyril cloisters. The foundation stone was delivered by the Kyiv garrison soldiers from the neighboring towns of Rzhyshchiv and Bucha. The wood came from the nearby Pushcha-Vodytsia forests. Also, infantry regiments from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Starodub, and Poltava were involved in the church's construction. Apart from workers from the neighboring villages, the Kiev Pechersk Lavra sent 50 of its best masons to work on the church.\n\nBoth the external and internal decoration on the church was carried out at the same time. Cast iron floor slabs were delivered from Moscow. Also, forms were made for the church's windows, doors, walls, and for space under the cupola. The planned iconostasis, designed by Rastrelli, was also added. The wood for the iconostasis, altar canopy, pulpit, and tsar's place were carved in Saint Petersburg in order to conserve time. The iconostasis' icons were carried out by Petersburg artists. For gilding, 1,028 slabs of gold were used in the interior.\n\nAlthough the exterior work was finished in 1754, interior work and decorations were not finished up until 1767. Alexei Antropov and Ivan Vishnyakov painted the church's icons, and the frescoes were done by Ukrainian masters I. Romenskyi and I. Chaikovskyi. A planned ramp that was to be installed to provide access to the church, was later changed to a wooden staircase due to the steepness of the hill. The wooden ramp was later (in 1844) changed to a cast iron one.\n\nAs the Empress planned to take personal care of the church, the church has no parish, and there is no bell tower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth. After her death, the imperial court took no interest in the church, and the church was left without any funding. For some time, the church existed off of private and voluntary funds, from people such as Andrey Muravyov.\n\nLater on, the church was handed down to the Kyiv Council in 1768. The Kiev City Duma took control over the church, and later reorganized into the Kyiv Council in 1785. In 1815, a strong storm tore off the church's cupolas. After the storm, the church was in need of a full restoration. In the next year, architect Andrey Melensky made a plan of the building's façade and sent them for consideration to Saint Petersburg. In 1825–1828, the church was restored, based on Melensky's plans. The red mission tiles was replaced by metal, resulting in the fact that the cupolas lost some decor and changed their form.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1953, many restorations were conducted on the foundations of the church. In addition, the restoration of the church's façade, interior, and decor was also conducted. From the time of the church's opening until 1932, when the Soviet Council ordered that the church be closed down, regular services were held. In 1935, the St. Andrew's Church was included into the Historical and Cultural Conservation \"All-Ukraine Museum Area.\" For some time after 1939, Saint Sophia Anti-religious Museum was located within the premises of the church. During World War II, regular church services were restored, only to be closed down again in 1961.\n\nFrom time to time, the church's stylobate was rented to different organizations up until 1992, when the stylobate was taken up by the Kiev Ecclesiastical Seminary of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kievan Patriarchate. On January 10, 1968, the church was included into the State Architectural and Historical Conservation area \"Saint Sophia Museum.\" On September 10 of the same year, the church was opened as a historical and architectural museum.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, original plans of Rastrelli's baroque cupolas were uncovered in Vienna, Austria. In 1970, the St. Sophia Museum requested photocopies of the originals from the Albertina Museum located in Vienna. In 1978, restorers headed by architect V. Korneyeva restored the church's domes based on drawings by Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Since 1987, the church is included into the National Conservation area \"Saint Sophia of Kyiv.\" Nowadays it is Cathedral of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. On the 255th anniversary of the construction, the Ukrainian Presidential Administration transferred the ownership of the building from the government to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In October 2018, the church was transferred to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople as a stauropegion.\n\nThe church was constructed on a 15-meter foundation-stylobate, which from the eastern side faces downhill and from the western—has a two-story construction. The church consists of a single dome and five small decorative spires. From the outside façade, Corinthian columns decorate the church, accompanied by additional decorations. The windows and doors of the church are decorated with ornamental details.\n\nAs the church sits atop a hill, foundation problems have been one of the main concerns of preservationists. More recently, the foundation below the church has started to shift, causing some concerns that the church's foundation might collapse. Cracks have already appeared in the church's foundation, resulting with the fact that a special committee was set up by the Minister of Emergency Situations Nestor Shufrich.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, they will conduct research on the building's foundation and its construction with the help of Ministry of Construction, Kiev City Administration, and the division of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Kyiv City.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1793873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793873", "title": "Soldering gun", "text": "Soldering gun\n\nA soldering gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder to achieve a strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch so it can be easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured to the end of the transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms at a much slower rate. An additional secondary winding is often used to power a pilot lamp which illuminates the workpiece. \n\nThe soldering gun is useful when soldered joints must be made intermittently. A constant-heat device has to be set in a safe place when powered but not actually in use, to prevent damage or injury. The fast-switching gun cools quickly enough to be set down a few seconds after use.\n\nSoldering guns are used where more heat is needed than from the lower-power soldering irons. They can be used for heavy electrical connections, stained glass assembly, and light sheet-metal work. Typical soldering guns are rated at 100 to 240 watts power. A gun may include a two-stage trigger to give two heat settings. Tips designed for cutting and shaping plastic are available; soldering guns for general home use may be supplied with a kit of different tips.\n\nThe temperature of the soldering tip is regulated manually by holding the button until the solder melts, and then releasing it. When the solder is about to start solidifying, the button is pressed again, and so on. An experienced worker develops the skill to regulate the temperature according to need. Because the temperature of the tip is not automatically regulated, use of a soldering gun for joints on printed circuit boards can result in too much heat supplied to the joint, damaging the circuit board.\n\nThe copper tip slowly dissolves in the solder and eventually has to be replaced. The soldering gun generates an electromagnetic spike when the button is released, which can be a problem for electromagnetically-sensitive devices. The spike can be seen when a high-efficiency LED is soldered, as the LED flashes. The heavy magnetic field produced by the tip can attract and hold small ferrous metal pieces (screws, etc.).\n\nPistol-grip electrically-heated soldering tools had been used since the 1920s. In 1941 Carl E. Weller invented and later obtained for a transformer-based soldering tool which heated and cooled rapidly, essentially as described in this article. Weller formed a company to manufacture and sell his invention commercially in 1946. The Weller company was bought in 1970 and merged into the Cooper Industries group, retaining the Weller brand for soldering equipment.\n\n"}

In most rural and small town schools, all of the students met in a single room. There, a single teacher taught academic basics to several grade levels of elementary-age children. While in many areas one-room schools are no longer used, it is not uncommon for them to remain in developing nations and rural or remote areas. Examples include remote parts of the American West, the Falklands, and the Shetland Islands.\n\nPrussia was among the first countries in the world to introduce a tax-funded and generally compulsory primary education for either boys and girls. In comparison, compulsory schooling in France or Great Britain was not successfully enacted until the 1880s. The state-sponsored system was introduced in the late 18th century and has had a widespread influence ever since. The first Prussian schools were simple one-room schools, but by 1773 Friedrich Eberhard von Rochow had already set up a model school with primary education in two separate age-grouped classes.\n\nIn Ireland, free primary education was mandated in 1831, prompting the establishment of many single-teacher National Schools across rural areas, most initially using a room in an existing building. By the 1890s there was a school in every parish. Most extant one- and two-room school buildings date from the decades after 1891 when primary education became compulsory. Most of those still in use today have been extended following merger with neighbouring schools. Since 2002, any state-funded school with at least 10 pupils is entitled to at least 2 teachers; the 21 schools which fell below this threshold are located on offshore islands. In recent decades, an increasing number of schools have been founded for parents not content with the National School system. These include \"Gaelscoileanna\" (which teach through Irish rather than English) and multi-denominational schools (most Irish schools are controlled by one or other of the main Christian churches). Although such schools eventually become eligible for state funding, they usually begin with a single teacher in a room or prefabricated building.\n\nMany schools also served as the local chapel on Sundays, and evening/Saturday meeting places for local people and activities. Being mostly rural, many schools had no plumbing or sanitation. Teaching standards often varied from school to school as the teacher was compelled to coach children of all ages/grades within one room and regardless of their area of main competence.\n\nThe quality of facilities at one-room schools varied with local economic conditions, but generally, the number of children at each grade level would vary with local populations. Most buildings were of simple frame construction, some with the school bell on a cupola. In the Midwest, sod construction was also used, as well as stone and adobe in areas like the Southwest where trees were scarce. In some locations, the schoolhouse was painted red, but most seem to have been white. \n\nMission Ridge School was one of the early schools in Mason County, West Virginia. It has since been moved to the West Virginia State Farm Museum complex near Point Pleasant. Examination of the materials in this building indicates that boards and timbers were hand-sawed and also hand-planed. Square nails were used throughout the building. Except for the roof and a few boards in the floor, all of the material in this building is original. The blackboard is painted black. It was not until much later that slate was used for chalkboards, although students often had individual slates for writing practice.\n\nTeachers in one-room schools were often former students themselves. Their role is well-described by a student from Kentucky in the 1940s:\nThe teachers that taught in the one room, rural schools were very special people. During the winter months they would get to the school early to get a fire started in the potbelly stove, so the building would be warm for the students. On many occasions they would prepare a hot, noon meal on top of the stove, usually consisting of soup or stew of some kind. They took care of their students like a new mother hen would care for her newly hatched chicks; always looking out for their health and welfare.\n\nA typical school day was 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with morning and afternoon recesses of 15 minutes each and an hour period for lunch. \"The older students were given the responsibility of bringing in water, carrying in coal or wood for the stove. The younger students would be given responsibilities according to their size and gender such as cleaning the black board (chalkboard), taking the erasers outside for dusting plus other duties that they were capable of doing.\"\n\nTransportation for children who lived too far to walk was often provided by horse-drawn kid hack or sulky, which could only travel a limited distance in a reasonable amount of time each morning and evening, or students might ride a horse, these being put out to pasture in an adjoining paddock during the day. In more recent times, students rode bicycles.\n\nThe school house was the center and focus for thousands of rural communities, hamlets, and small towns. Often, town meetings and picnics were also held there. \n\nThe vast majority of one-room schools in the United States are no longer used as schools and have either been torn down or converted for other purposes. However, in some rural communities, including among the Amish, one-room or two-room schools are still used, primarily for elementary education, with students graduating to local or regional middle and high schools.\n\nThere are several historic one-room schoolhouses in the United States that were built in the shape of an octagon, instead of the more traditional rectangular style. Most are located in the northeastern part of the country and some have been restored and placed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe following octagonal schoolhouses still stand:\n\n\nThe teacher's residence, or teacherage, was often attached to the school, or very close by, so that a male teacher's wife and family were an integral part of the management and support system for the school. Single, female teachers were more often billeted or boarded with a local family to provide for social norms requiring social supervision of single females.\n\nMotorized school buses in the 1920s made longer distances possible, and one-room schools were soon consolidated in most portions of the United States into multiple classroom schools where classes could be held separately for various grade levels. Gradually, one-room school houses were replaced. Most one-room schools had been replaced by larger schools by World War II except in the most rural areas. However, they are still common in rural parts of Australia and Alaska.\n\nIn Calvert County, Maryland, Port Republic School Number 7 closed its doors in 1932 and sat unused for over 40 years. Then, in 1976 the Calvert Retired Teachers Association, looking for a Bicentennial Year project, decided to restore the one-room schoolhouse. On July 24, 1977, after months of hard work by teachers and community volunteers, the old school bell rang out once more, and the little one-room school house, filled with its memories and memorabilia, was ready for visitors. It is now one of the county's tourist attractions. A similar project was done in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, by retired Teachers and Community Volunteers. The restored schoolhouse is located in front of Queen Anne's County High School. In Iowa, over 125 small one-room school houses have been turned into local museums. The buildings in some places found new purpose as homes. \n\nIn Harrisburg, Nebraska, Flowerfield School serves as a living museum, and fourth-graders within the Nebraska panhandle spend a day at Flowerfield going through an average school day in 1888. The students have the opportunity to experience both log and sod versions of the house, writing with quill pens, and a trip to the nearby museum, where they learn about other aspects of life in 1888.\n\nIn Vandalia, Indiana, the Vandalia District # 2 one-room schoolhouse served Owen County’s Lafayette Township students in grades 1 – 8 from the time it was completed in 1868 until it closed in 1951. The building, restored by a group of volunteers in 1976, is presently maintained and preserved by the Vandalia Community Preservation Association.\n\nThe One Room School House Project of Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas, includes listings and information on some 880 schools throughout the state and nation. The information, pictures, and stories included in this site have been collected and sent to the project by researchers and historians from across America.\n\nAs of 2017, almost 400 one-rooms schools still operate in the United States, including schoolhouses in:\n\n\n\n"}

The process was invented by Bartolomé de Medina in Pachuca, Mexico, in 1554. The patio process was the first process to use mercury amalgamation to recover silver from ore. It replaced smelting as the primary method of extracting silver from ore at Spanish colonies in the Americas. Other amalgamation processes were later developed, importantly the pan amalgamation process, and its variant, the Washoe process. The silver separation process generally differed from gold parting and gold extraction, although amalgamation with mercury is also sometimes used to extract gold.\n\nBartolomé de Medina was a successful Spanish merchant who became fascinated with the problem of decreasing silver yields from ores mined in Spanish America. By the mid-sixteenth century, it was well known in Spain that American silver production was in decline due to the depletion of high-grade ores and increasing production costs. The New Laws, prohibiting the enslavement of Indians, had resulted in higher labor costs as miners turned to wage labor and expensive African slaves. These higher production costs made mining and smelting anything but the highest grade silver ores prohibitively expensive, just as the availability of high grade ores was in decline. Bartolomé de Medina initially focused his attentions on learning about new smelting methods from smelters in Spain. He was approached during his research by an unknown German man, known only as \"Maestro Lorenzo,\" who told him that silver could be extracted from ground ores using mercury and a salt-water brine. With this knowledge, Medina left Spain for New Spain (Mexico) in 1554 and established a model patio refinery in order to prove the effectiveness of the new technology. Medina is generally credited with adding \"magistral\" (a copper sulfate) to the mercury and salt-water solution in order to catalyze the amalgamation reaction. However, some historians assert that there were already sufficient copper sulfates in the local ores and that no additional magistral was needed. Regardless of whether or not Medina's contribution was entirely original, he promoted his process to local miners and was able to obtain a patent from the Viceroy of New Spain. As a result, he is generally credited with the invention of silver amalgamation in the form of the patio process.\n\nSilver ores were crushed (typically either in \"arrastras\" or stamp mills) to a fine slime which was mixed with salt, water, magistral (essentially an impure form of copper sulfate), and mercury, and spread in a 1-to-2-foot-thick (0.30 to 0.61 m) layer in a patio (a shallow-walled, open enclosure). Horses were driven around on the patio to further mix the ingredients. After weeks of mixing and soaking in the sun, a complex reaction converted the silver to native metal, which formed an amalgam with the mercury. Heating this amalgam drove off the mercury, leaving the silver. The amount of salt and copper sulfate varied from one-quarter to ten pounds of one or the other, or both, per ton of ore treated. The decision of how much of each ingredient to add, how much mixing was needed, and when to halt the process depended on the skill of an \"azoguero\" (English: quicksilver man). The loss of mercury in amalgamation processes is generally one to two times the weight of silver recovered.\n\nThe patio process was the first form of amalgamation. However, it is unclear whether this process or a similar process—in which amalgamation occurred in heated vats rather than open patios—was the predominant form of amalgamation in New Spain, as the earliest known illustration of the patio process dates from 1761. There is substantial evidence that both processes were used from an early date in New Spain, while open patios were never adopted in Peru. Both processes required that ore be crushed and refiners quickly established mills to process ore once amalgamation was introduced. By the seventeenth century, water-powered mills became dominant in both New Spain and Peru.\n\nDue to amalgamation's reliance upon mercury, an expansion of mercury production was central to the expansion of silver production. From shortly after the invention of mercury amalgamation to the end of the colonial period, the Spanish crown maintained a monopoly on mercury production and distribution, ensuring a steady supply of royal income. Fluctuations in mercury prices generally resulted in corresponding increases and decreases in silver production.\n\nThe introduction of amalgamation to silver refining in the Americas not only ended the mid-sixteenth century crisis in silver production, it also inaugurated a rapid expansion of silver production in New Spain and Peru as miners could now profitably mine lower-grade ores. As a result of this expansion, the Americas became the primary producer of the world's silver, with Spanish America producing three-fifths of the world's silver supply prior to 1900.\n\nWhile a number of factors resulted in the minimal use of forced Indian labor in Mexican silver production, the introduction of silver amalgamation allowed for an expansion of silver production in Peru that had profound consequences for Peru's native population. Francisco Toledo, the Viceroy of Peru in the 1570s, saw amalgamation as the key to expanding Peruvian silver production. He encouraged miners to adopt amalgamation and construct mercury mines. More significantly, in order to provide sufficient labor to accommodate the expansion of silver mining to lower-grade ores, Toledo organized an Indian draft labor system, the mita. Under this system, thousands of natives were forced to work in silver and mercury mines for less than subsistence-level wages. Twelve thousand draft laborers regularly worked at the largest mine in the Americas, located at Potosí in modern Bolivia. Native attempts to avoid the mita led to the abandonment of many Indian villages throughout Peru. Spanish monopolization of refining through amalgamation cut natives out of what had earlier been a native-dominated enterprise. Refining represented the most profitable segment of silver production. In conjunction with the mita, the exclusion of natives from owning refineries contributed to the transformation of Peruvian natives into a poorly paid labor force.\n\nThe rapid expansion of silver production and coinage—made possible due to the invention of amalgamation—has often been identified as the primary driver of the price revolution, a period of high inflation lasting from the sixteenth to early seventeenth-century in Europe. Proponents of this theory argue that Spain's reliance on silver coins from the Americas to finance its large balance of payments deficits resulted in a general expansion of the European money supply and corresponding inflation. Critics of the theory, however, argue that inflation was really a result of European government policies and population growth.\n\nWhile the role of the expansion in silver production in the price revolution may be disputed, this expansion is often acknowledged as a key ingredient in the formation of early-modern world trade. Spanish American production fed Chinese demand for silver, facilitating the development of extensive trade networks linking Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas as Europeans sought to gain access to Chinese wares.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1793933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793933", "title": "Glottalization", "text": "Glottalization\n\nGlottalization is the complete or partial closure of the glottis during the articulation of another sound. Glottalization of vowels and other sonorants is most often realized as creaky voice (partial closure). Glottalization of obstruent consonants usually involves complete closure of the glottis; another way to describe this phenomenon is to say that a glottal stop is made simultaneously with another consonant. In certain cases, the glottal stop can even wholly replace the voiceless consonant. The term 'glottalized' is also used for ejective and implosive consonants; see glottalic consonant for examples.\n\nThere are two other ways to represent glottalization of sonorants in the IPA: (a) the same way as ejectives, with an apostrophe; or (b) with the under-tilde for creaky voice. For example, the Yapese word for \"sick\" with a glottalized \"m\" could be transcribed as either or . (In some typefaces, the apostrophe will occur above the m.)\n\nGlottalization varies along three parameters, all of which are continuums. The \"degree\" of glottalization varies from none (modal voice, ) through stiff voice () and creaky voice () to full glottal closure (glottal reinforcement or glottal replacement, described below). The \"timing\" also varies, from a simultaneous single segment to an onset or coda such as or to a sequence such as or . Full or partial closure of the glottis also allows glottalic airstream mechanisms to operate, producing ejective or implosive consonants; implosives may themselves have modal, stiff, or creaky voice. It is not always clear from linguistic descriptions if a language has a series of light ejectives or voiceless consonants with glottal reinforcement, or similarly if it has a series of light implosives or voiced consonants with glottal reinforcement. The airstream parameter is only known to be relevant to obstruents, but the first two are involved with both obstruents and sonorants, including vowels.\n\nWhen a phoneme is completely substituted by a glottal stop , one speaks of glottaling or glottal replacement. This is, for instance, very common in British English dialects such as Cockney, Estuary English, and the various Northern English dialects. In these dialects, the glottal stop is an allophone of , and word-finally, and when followed by an unstressed vowel (including syllabic and ) in a post-stress syllable. 'Water' can be pronounced – the glottal stop has superseded the 't' sound. Other examples include \"city\" , \"bottle\" , \"Britain\" , \"seniority\" . In some consonant clusters, glottal replacement of /t/ is common even among RP speakers. \n\nGlottal replacement also occurs in Indonesian, where syllable final is produced as a glottal stop. In Hawaiian, the glottal stop is reconstructed to have come from other Proto-Polynesian consonants. The following table displays the shift → as well as the shift → .\n\nGlottal replacement is not purely a feature of consonants. Yanesha' has three vowel qualities (, , and ) that have phonemic contrasts between short, long, and \"laryngeal\" or glottalized forms. While the latter generally consists of creaky phonation, there is some allophony involved. In pre-final contexts, a variation occurs (especially before voiced consonants) ranging from creaky phonation throughout the vowel to a sequence of a vowel, glottal stop, and a slightly rearticulated vowel: ('deer') → .\n\nWhen a phoneme is accompanied (either sequentially or simultaneously) by a , then one speaks of pre-glottalization or glottal reinforcement.\n\nThis is common in some varieties of English, RP included; and are the most affected but and also regularly show pre-glottalization. In the English dialects exhibiting pre-glottalization, the consonants in question are usually glottalized in the coda position: \"what\" , \"fiction\" , \"milkman\" , \"opera\" . To a certain extent, some varieties of English have free variation between glottal replacement and glottal reinforcement.\n\nGlottal reinforcement may occasionally be observed in more conservative varieties of Tweants, a dialect of the Dutch Low Saxon language group. It almost exclusively concerns the consonant, and is sometimes orthographically represented by a double -t. It mostly occurs in monosyllabic verbs, such as \"iej loatt\" (you let) and \"wie weett\" (we know). Sometimes it may also occur in contracted words, such as in the phrase: \"Wo geet t?\" (lit. \"how goes it?\"), which is pronounced .\n\n\nGlottalization\n\nEnglish accents\n\n"}

One of his series of mysteries features the American rare book and manuscript collector, Dave Cannon, and takes place in Britain.\n\nJay Williams also wrote a number of successful historical novels for adults, including \"The Witches\", a look at the eradication of the healing women in Scotland; \"Solomon and Sheba\"; \"The Siege\", a tale of the 13th-century wars initiated by the Pope against the Albigensian heresy; \"Tomorrow's Fire\" (1964), set during the Third Crusade; and \"The Rogue from Padua\", a novel that takes place in the Renaissance.\n\nHe was also interested in the future in his many speculative science fiction tales, often published in \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\"; eight of these stories were published under the title, \"Unearthly Beasts\". His novel \"Uniad\" sees a world in which individuality has shrunk.\n\nHis novel \"The Forger\" examines commercialism and art, and the relation of art to real life.\n\nWilliams also wrote non-fiction books: \"The Middle Ages\", \"Knights of the Crusades\", \"The Spanish Armada\", and \"Joan of Arc\", as well as his young adult Landmark book on World War II, \"The Battle for the North Atlantic\". He was known for his extensive research in both his fiction and non-fiction.\n\nHe wrote about the environment in his \"Fall of the Sparrow\", describing the loss of numerous animal and bird species, often due to man; and he wrote a travel book, \"A Change of Climate\", a European trip with his son, Chris.\n\nWilliams and his wife Barbara Girsdansky were married June 3, 1941. They had a son, Christopher (\"Chris\"), and a daughter, Victoria.\n\nJay Williams died at age 64 from a heart attack while on a trip to London on July 12, 1978.\n\n"}

It was used as both a single-decker bus and a double-decker bus chassis largely in Continental Europe.\n\nThe B7L was also available as an integrally-constructed Volvo bus - the Volvo 5000 (later renumbered 7500, with aluminium structure) and Volvo 7000 (later renumbered 7700, with stainless steel structure).\n\nWhilst similar to the B10L in design, both featuring a side-mounted engine, the B7L's engine was a Volvo D7C unit mounted vertically, as opposed to the horizontally mounted Volvo DH10/GH10 engine of the B10L; the radiator was mounted above the engine instead of the right-hand side, allowing the floor to be lower behind the rear axle. As with the B10L, B7L was also available in its articulated form named the B7LA.\n\nOutside Continental Europe, the B7L was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2000, as a replacement for the Volvo B10BLE, and the Volvo Olympian. It could be fitted with Wright Eclipse body (and Eclipse Fusion body for B7LA), but proved unpopular due to the arrangement of engine and radiator limiting seating capacity, with FirstGroup being the only major customer. Volvo responded by introducing the B7RLE and the B7TL for the UK market, fitted with more conventional Transverse engines. In Ireland, Bus Éireann purchased 25 B7L's between 2001 & 2003. The double-decker version of B7L was also sold in UK, used as public bus (East Lancs Nordic body) or sightseeing bus (Ayats Bravo City open-top body).\n\nVolvo B7L and B7LA-based buses are used in Greece. In Athens, Volvo B7LAs constructed by Saracakis have been used since 1999. In Thessaloniki, the local operator OASTH introduced 22 B7LAs in 2004 with more coming in 2005 and 2006, while 54 B7Ls were introduced in 2004 and 2005 together with 15 11m B7Ls also in 2005 all constructed by ELVO.\n\nVolvo B7L used in Israel as well, but the bodyworks were Mercury by Merkavim and Hispano Habit. Mercury had Voith D864.3E transmission while Hispano had ZF Ecomat 5HP502 transmission. Metrodan, Israeli bus company served in Beersheba had Volvo B7L (Mercury bodywork by Merkavim) and Hispano Habit. Kavim had only Mercury Merkavim B7L (except one Hispano Habit), Metropoline had Volvo B7L with Mercury bodywork and Egged had B7L as well.\n\nIn 2005, Wrightbus unveiled the Wright StreetCar which is a tram-like articulated bus built with modified B7LA chassis. The chassis has a shorter front overhang, the driver's cab relocated to above the front axle and the radiator relocated to the roof, giving a full-width rear window.\n\nThe Volvo B7L was superseded by the Volvo B9L in 2006.\n\n"}

The drag link converts the sweeping arc of the steering arm to linear motion in the plane of the other steering links.\n\nTypically, one end of the drag link is connected via the Pitman arm and steering gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the steering arm.the pit arm is the major part of the system.\n\nAn alternate steering mechanism is a rack and pinion, a three bar linkage that eliminates the drag link by directly moving a center link.\n\n\"The drag link connects the pitman arm to the steering arm, or in some applications it connects to the tie rod assembly. Unlike a center link, the drag link does not connect to an idler arm, and has no inner tie rod ends attached to it. On some applications the drag link swings from the front to the rear of the vehicle. On these applications the drag link connects to the steering arm located at the wheel.

{"id": "1793984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793984", "title": "General Magic", "text": "General Magic\n\nGeneral Magic was an American software and electronics company co-founded by Bill Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld, and Marc Porat. Based in Mountain View, California, the company developed precursors to \"USB, software modems, small touchscreens, touchscreen controller ICs, ASICs, multimedia email, networked games, streaming TV, and early e-commerce notions.\" General Magic's main product was Magic Cap, the operating system used in 1994 by the Motorola Envoy and Sony's Magic Link PDA. It also introduced the programming language Telescript. After announcing it would cease operations in 2002, it was liquidated in 2004 with Paul Allen purchasing most of its patents.\n\nThe original project started in 1989 within Apple Computer, when Marc Porat convinced Apple's CEO at the time John Sculley that the next generation of computing would require a partnership of computer, communications and consumer electronics companies to cooperate. Known as the Paradigm project, the project ran for some time within Apple, but management remained generally uninterested and the team struggled for resources. Eventually they approached Sculley with the idea of spinning off the group as a separate company, which occurred in May 1990. In 1990 Marc Porat, Andy Hertzfeld, and Bill Atkinson in Mountain View, California founded it. Apple took a minority stake in the company, with John Sculley joining the General Magic board.\n\nPorat, Hertzfeld and Atkinson were soon joined at General Magic by Susan Kare, and most of Apple's System 7 team, including Bruce Leak, Darin Adler and Phil Goldman.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Joanna Hoffman was vice president of marketing. In 1990, Porat wrote the following note to Sculley: \"A tiny computer, a phone, a very personal object . . . It must be beautiful. It must offer the kind of personal satisfaction that a fine piece of jewelry brings. It will have a perceived value even when it's not being used... Once you use it you won't be able to live without it.\"\n\nThe company initially operated in near-complete secrecy. By 1992, some of the world's largest electronics corporations, including Sony, Motorola, Matsushita, Philips and AT&T Corporation were partners and investors in General Magic, creating significant buzz in the industry. Sculley, Motorola CEO George Fisher, Sony president Norio Ogha, and AT&T division chairman Victor Pelsen became board members. As the operations expanded, the company reportedly let rabbits roam the offices to inspire creativity.\n\nIn 1992–1993, while Sculley was still a director of General Magic, Apple entered the consumer electronics market with a poorly-received \"personal digital assistant\" that became the Apple Newton. By early 1993, Newton (originally designed as a tablet with no communications capabilities) started to attract market interest away from General Magic. \n\nIn February 1993, the company had 100 employees. On February 8, the \"New York Times\" referred to General Magic as \"Silicon Valley's most closely watched start-up company.\" It reported that the company was introducing software technology called Telescript with the intent of creating a \"standard for transmitting messages among any machines that compute, regardless of who makes them.\" The company also announced the software Magic Cap, an operating system catered to communications. Telescript would eventually come out in 1996 at the start of the internet boom. \n\nIn an article titled \"Here's Where Woodstock Meets Silicon Valley,\" on February 27, 1993, the \"New York Times\" reported that General Magic had backing from \"American Telephone and Telegraph, Sony, Motorola, Philips Electronics and Matsushita Electric Industrial.\" Marc Porat remained the chief executive of the company.\n\nBy 1994, the \"General Magic Alliance\" of cross-industry partners had expanded to 16 global telecommunications and consumer electronics companies, including Cable & Wireless, France Telecom, NTT, Northern Telecom, Toshiba, Oki, Sanyo, Mitsubishi, and Fujitsu. Each of the so-called \"Founding Partners\" invested up to $6 million in the company and named a senior executive to the company's \"Founding Partner's Council.\"\n\nThe first \"General Magic Alliance\" hardware products, using the Magic Cap software, were two personal digital assistants (PDAs) that came out in the summer of 1994, with Motorola producing the Motorola Envoy Personal Wireless Communicator and Sony producing the $800 wireline Sony Magic Link. Alliance partner AT&T launched its PersonaLink network to host the devices, a closed network that did not connect to the emerging internet. AT&T eventually shut down the PersonaLink network in 1996.\n\nThe company launched an IPO on NASDAQ in February 1995. General Magic raised $96 million in the IPO, and a total of $200 million from 16 different investors. The company's stock value doubled after its IPO.\n\nSteve Markman was hired to run General Magic in 1996, and he hired Kevin Surace to head a new telephony group. This new team of 60–70 people set out to create a voice recognition-based personal assistant service that would be as close to human interaction as possible. The first service delivered was Portico (code named Serengeti during development), and the interface was called Mary, named after Mary McDonald-Lewis, who voiced Portico, Serengeti and GM's later version, OnStar. Portico synchronized to devices such as the Palm Connected Organizer and Microsoft Outlook and handled voicemail, call forwarding, email, calendar etc., all through the user's own personal 800 number. General Magic was the first company to employ a large number of linguists to make their software seem real and responses varied, with General Magic investors receiving several key patents relating to voice recognition and artificial personality.\n\nThe Portico system was also scaled back and sold through many partners including Quest and Excite. At its peak, the system supported approximately 2.5 million users. In 1997 Steve Markman hired Linda Hayes as Chief Marketing Officer, who in turn hired a new marketing team, which launched Portico. The Portico launch is attributed with lifting General Magic's stock price from $1 in 1997 to $18 in 2000.\n\nAccording to \"Fast Company\", the company's original [device] idea was \"practically, dead,\" with people not buying General Magic devices in quantity.\n\nWhile Portico ran its voice portal business, the original handheld group was spun off in 1998 as \"Icras\". The new company sold the Magic Cap OS as hardware named \"DataRover\" and focused on vertical market systems.\n\nGeneral Magic announced a major licensing deal and investments from Microsoft in March 1998. The deal gave Microsoft access to certain intellectual property, and helped General Magic move toward integrating Portico with Microsoft products.\n\nThe OnStar Virtual Advisor was developed at this time as well for General Motors.\n\nIn 1999 the Marketing Team developed a separate consumer product called MyTalk. Created by Kevin Wray, the MyTalk product was a success and went on to win the Computerworld Smithsonian Award for the first commercially successful voice recognition consumer product. Today MyTalk was also listed in the permanent Smithsonian Museum collection. Because of the product's momentum, the intent was to spin off Hayes’ group with Wray leading the product management. However, because of failure to agree on technology licensing terms, the spin-off stalled.\n\nBy 1999, the company's stock had plunged significantly, with \"Forbes\" attributing the drop to \"losses, layoffs and missed projections.\" Most of the management that was involved in bringing Portico to market left by early 2000 to pursue other interests with Internet startups. A new team was brought in led by Kathleen Layton. The new team took the company in the direction of turning its voice services into enterprise software offerings. The company announced it would cease operations on September 18, 2002. The company was liquidated in 2004. The OnStar assets were turned over to EDS to run for General Motors. The patents were auctioned by the court.\n\nMost of the patents the company had developed were purchased by Paul Allen.\n\nAccording to \"Electronics Weekly,\" the company \"developed a precursor of USB, software modems, small touchscreens, touchscreen controller ICs, ASICs, multimedia email, networked games, streaming TV and early e-commerce notions.\"\n\nGeneral Magic's main product was Magic Cap, an operating system which allowed users to \"set their own rules for message alerts and acquiring information\" on PDAs, according to CNET. The basic idea behind the system was to distribute the typical computing load across many machines in the network using Magic Cap, which was a fairly minimal operating system that was essentially a UI. The UI is based on a \"rooms\" metaphor; for example, e-mail and an address book can be found in the office, and games might be found in a living room. User applications were generally written in Magic Script, a utility language variant of the C programming language with object oriented extensions.\n\nIt was used on the Envoy PDA by Motorola and the MagicLink PDA by Sony. Sony and Motorola introduced Magic Cap devices in late 1994, based on the Motorola 68300 Dragon microprocessor. The launch suffered from a lack of real supporting infrastructure. Unlike the Newton and other PDAs being introduced at the same time, the Magic Cap system also did not rely on handwriting recognition, putting it at a marketing disadvantage. Partners ended production of Magic Cap devices by 1997.\n\nGeneral Magic planned to release Magic Cap software development tools with Metrowerks by the summer of 1995.\n\nIts other software, Telescript, was \"software-agent technology that would search the Web and automatically retrieve information such as stock quotes and airline ticket prices.\" The script was introduced with the intent of creating a \"standard for transmitting messages among any machines that compute, regardless of who makes them.\"\n\nThe Telescript programming language made communications a first-class primitive of the language. Telescript is compiled into a cross-platform bytecode in much the same fashion as the Java programming language, but is able to migrate running processes between virtual machines. The developers saw a time when Telescript application engines would be ubiquitous, and interconnected Telescript engines would form a \"Telescript Cloud\" across which mobile applications could execute.\n\nThe company achieved many technical breakthroughs, including software modems (eliminating the need for modem chips), small touchscreens and touchscreen controller ASICs, highly integrated systems-on-a-chip designs for its partners' devices, rich multimedia email, networked games, streaming television, and early versions of e-commerce.\n\nAccording to former General Magic employee Marco DeMiroz, it was the \"Fairchild [Semiconductor] of the 90s.\"\n\nA documentary film about the company opened at the Tribeca Film Festival April 20, 2018. It was later shown at the SFFilm Festival in San Francisco on November 3, 2018. The company founders had hired filmmakers including Sarah Kerruish to document their development process in the 1990s, and Kerruish included some of that original footage of General Magic's offices in the film. The film includes interviews with Marc Porat, Andy Hertzfield, Joanna Hoffman, Megan Smith, and Tony Fadell.\n\n"}

Its main campus which provides tertiary education is situated in Mendiola, Manila. It has an affiliated campus that provides elementary and high school education in Taytay, Rizal. The Benedictine College in Alabang, Muntinlupa known as the San Beda College Alabang is an autonomous institution despite being an affiliate of San Beda University.\n\nSan Beda was established in 1901 by monks of the Ordo Sancti Benedicti (OSB) or Order of St. Benedict, also known as the Benedictines. Its founder, St. Benedict, is acclaimed as the \"Father of Western Monasticism\" and the \"Patron of Europe\". From its inception, the school was dedicated to the cause of Catholic education and the formation of Christians committed to excellence and service of God and country. It is attached to the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat, founded from the Abbey of Montserrat in Cataluña, Spain.\n\nSan Beda, which was known as El Colegio de San Beda, started as an all-boys grade school in Manila. It has since expanded to a full university with both undergraduate and post-graduate degree programs. The institution has been a recognized university since February 6, 2018, marking it as a Benedictine University found only in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn 1895, 14 Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat in Spain arrived in the Philippines. Their intent was to do mission work in Surigao. However, as Americans slowly but successfully began to colonize the Islands, the Benedictine monks, fearing the spread of Protestantism, began to contemplate the idea of establishing a school dedicated to propagate and defend the Catholic faith. This vision was realized in 1901 when the monks transferred to Manila and Spanish Benedictine monk Fr. Juan Sabater OSB founded the \"El Colegio de San Beda,\" so named after the Venerable St. Bede of England. It was located in Arlegui Street.\n\nDuring the inauguration of San Beda on June 17, 1901, Fr. Silvestre Jofre, OSB said in his homily that, “The College of San Beda comes to the arena with the sole purpose of helping to defend the Catholic battlements in the field of education.” The school opened exclusively for young boys with 212 students taking \"primaria enseñanza\" and \"secundaria enseñanza\", the equivalent of grade school and high school with the first two years of college.\nOn 24 January 1906, San Beda College became affiliated with University of Santo Tomas. Bedan graduates were allowed to pursue further studies at UST without having to take qualifying exams. In 1910, however, the school revised its whole academic curriculum as a result of the requirements set by a new law in order for schools to be recognized by the government. San Beda became an independent private college with the authority to grant the Bachelor of Arts degree and diplomas in elementary and high school. It began to shift from Spanish to English as language of instruction and started to teach not only the English language but American history and politics as well. In 1916, Jesus Y. Mercado, a member of the Benedictine order, designed the first college seal. In 1918, as a result of the growing American influence, the college decided to drop its old name, \"El Colegio de San Beda,\" and began calling itself San Beda College.\n\nIn 1926, the Benedictine monks moved the school to Mendiola Street where it still stands. The transfer was needed to cope with demands for a bigger campus. By 1927, the courses offered by San Beda expanded and included grade school, high school, two-year courses of pre-medicine and pre-law, and the first two years of commerce. During that year, Bedan athletes won their first crown in the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) league.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1947, the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat in Manila was under the apostolic administration of Abbot Alcuin Deutsch, OSB of St. John's Abbey, Collegeville, Minnesota. Three monks were sent to Manila to administer the Abbey and San Beda College. The College welcomed the only American rector in its history, Fr. Boniface Joseph Axtmann, OSB. In 1940 the school began to carry the Red Lion as its emblem. When World War II broke out, San Beda College was used by the Japanese Imperial Army as a garrison and supply depot. During these years, classes were held quietly in the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat, although classes were limited.\n\nAfter the liberation by joint Filipino and American troops, San Beda was used by the 60th U.S. Army Field Hospital briefly.\n\nAfter the war, the school began to expand. After the priest Boniface Axtmann's liberal democratic style of running the College ended in 1947, a similar kind of leadership emerged under the administration of the Spanish Benedictine priest, Sergio Martinez, OSB. During his term, he decided to offer programs in arts, sciences, and jurisprudence. In 1948, Martinez formally established the San Beda College of Law. From 1952 to 1957, and 1960 to 1961, the San Beda Law School earned the distinction of producing a 100% passing record during the bar examinations. San Beda College became one of the founding schools of the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines.\n\nEventually, San Beda College became a chartered school of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities in 1957. Then Rector Fr. Benigno Benabarre, OSB was responsible for the school's inclusion in the PAASCU. He set up an alumni network of Bedans, which would eventually become the San Beda College Alumni Association.\n\nOn June 17, 2001, San Beda College celebrated its centennial. During the opening ceremonies for its pre-centennial in 2000, former president Corazon Aquino, Bedan alumni senators Raul Roco and Rene Saguisag and then rector-president Bernardo Ma. Perez, OSB graced the event.\n\nIn that same year, a new administration under Fr. Anscar J. Chupungco, OSB was installed. At the same time, San Beda College offered the Graduate Program in Business which was granted full autonomy and rated \"very good\" by the Commission on Higher Education.\n\nOn June 17, 2002, the San Beda College of Medicine and the Graduate Program in Liturgy were inaugurated, heralding the school's expansion program in health sciences. The following year, the College of Nursing and the Graduate School of Law were established. To give a more conducive academic environment to grade school and high school students, the San Beda College-Rizal campus was formally opened in June 2004. That same year, St. Benedict's College was formally renamed San Beda College Alabang.\n\nSan Beda represented the Philippines in a five-country research collaboration in the ASEAN region. On February 10, 2009, Fr. De Jesus, representing San Beda College, signed an agreement with the Presidents of Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia; Universitas Kelantan, Malaysia; Ho Chi Minh Business University, Vietnam; and University of St. Galen, Switzerland (in collaboration with Singapore), establishing the ASEAN Network for Inter-Cultural Management and Economic Studies (ANIMES). The Research Network will provide faculty members of San Beda College an international window for their research outputs as well as joint research activities with peers from the other ASEAN countries.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, San Beda was granted University status by the Commission on Higher Education 501st Commission-en-Banc and Management Committee.\n\nAlthough the Mendiola campus is the oldest, the first San Beda campus was originally in Arlegui Street near the compounds of the Malacañang Palace. The Benedictine College, however, decided to relocate the school and the order's monastery to Mendiola to accommodate an increasing student population. The Mendiola Campus formally opened in 1926.\n\nDue to the social and political unrest during the 1970s, the Benedictine monks initially entertained the thought of leaving Mendiola and of transferring to Alabang where they recently acquired a property. The monastic fathers abandoned the idea and decided to stay in Mendiola and to build another campus in Alabang at the same time.\n\nSBU Manila houses four colleges: Arts and Sciences, Nursing, Medicine, and Law. The three graduate schools of San Beda – Business, Law, and Liturgy – are in the Mendiola campus. The campus also houses the Senior High School Department of SBU Manila.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is the oldest college or tertiary level department in San Beda University. It was founded in the year 1910, making it the second oldest liberal arts college in the Philippine Isles. More fondly called by its acronym, \"CAS,\" the Arts and Sciences department has brought many awards and achievements to San Beda University. The CAS was instrumental in San Beda University's being granted the Level III accreditation and reaccreditation in 2001, in 2003, and in 2014 respectively, by the PAASCU, as well as the autonomy status given by the Commission on Higher Education in 2003.\n\nThe San Beda College of Nursing (CON) offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. The CON began its operations 2003, in consortium with the Loyola Medical College Foundation chaired by Dr. Johnny Fong. The consortium with Loyola Foundation ended in 2008. The CON is now solely run by San Beda. The Nursing School of San Beda has been granted PAASCU Level I Accreditation.\n\nIn addition to the Nursing department, the San Beda University administration put up another department to strengthen its health sciences program. The San Beda College of Medicine (SBCM) was formally established on March 9, 2002, with the task of offering a four-year course leading to the degree of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) as its fifth unit. It has a faculty of over 70 medical lecturers, who come mostly from the University of the Philippines Manila.\n\nThe college is at St. Benedict's Hall. It uses several laboratories in St. Maur's Building along with other colleges and has a dedicated cadaver room on the third floor for its anatomy classes.\n\nThe CoM has sent examinees from its first class of graduates from the school term 2002–2003 to the August 2007 medical board exams.\n\nThe San Beda College of Law (CoL) was founded in 1948 upon the initiative of former rector-president Fr. Sergio Martinez, OSB. Feliciano Jover Ledesma, an Ateneo graduate, was the first dean of the San Beda Law School. It sent bar candidates for the first time in 1952, who all passed the bar. From 1952 up to 1957, and 1960 to 1961, the San Beda Law School achieved the feat of attaining a 100 percent passing rate in the Bar Exams.\n\nIt has produced lawyers such as the current President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, former Senator Rene Saguisag, the late Senator Raul S. Roco, Senator Leila M. De Lima, Former Commission on Elections Chairman Sixto Brillantes Jr., and nine Justices of the Supreme Court – Florenz D. Regalado, the holder of the highest bar exam grade in the country, Justo P. Torres Jr., Antonio M. Martinez, Romeo J.

It is in Havila Main Road, Barangay San Juan, Taytay, Rizal and became operational in academic year 2004–2005, initially with nursery, Kinder, preparatory, grade 1, and first and second year high school levels. Thus, the primary, middle, and high schools became the units of the Integrated Basic Education Department (IBED). Moreover, the academic curriculum was re-aligned with the school's co-educational program and the phase-out of the grade and high school departments in the Manila campus. The last batch of Grade 6 students in Manila campus graduated in 2009 and 4th Year High School in 2006.\n\nThe Affiliated Integrated Basic Education Department is composed of the following: Grade School, Junior High School, and Senior High School.\n\nLocated in Alabang Hills Village in Muntinlupa, San Beda College Alabang (SBCA) was founded on July 10, 1972, and was originally named the Benedictine Abbey School. It began as a basic co-educational school. In 1995, it gained college status and renamed itself as St. Benedict College which also marked the opening of the Fr. Bellarmine Baltasar Gymnasium (then St. Benedict College Gym). In 2001, Fr. Aloysius Maranan established the College of Arts and Sciences program to its college curriculum. In 2004, the college changed its name and has formally adopted the name, San Beda College Alabang.\n\nThe rector-president of San Beda College Alabang is Dom Clement Ma. H. Roque, OSB, who served as former dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in San Beda University, Manila.\n\nThe following are list of people who have served as rector presidents of San Beda University. All have were monastics who are affiliated with the Order of Saint Benedict.\n\nSan Beda University has published research materials and scholarly journals published by its faculty and administrators.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences publishes an annual scholarly journal called \"Scientia\", which deals with topics such as economics, social sciences, history, public administration and management concepts. The College of Law releases an annual research material called \"The San Beda Law Journal.\" The articles in the San Beda Law Journal are written by the students and faculty of the San Beda Law School. The Graduate School of Business faculty articles are published in the \"Graduate School of Business Journal\". The Graduate School of Liturgy produces the \"Scientia Liturgica\", a journal that is dedicated to the advancement of liturgical studies in the Philippines and in Asia. The Graduate School of Law publishes the well-respected \"San Beda Graduate School of Law Journal of Graduate Research\".\n\nThe College of Nursing and Medicine publishes the Journal of Health and Caring Sciences which publishes emerging topics on human health, wellness and caring science.\n\nSince its construction in Mendiola Street, majority of the buildings of San Beda University adapted the Neo-Gothic style of architecture. However, renovations have been made in some areas such as the tiles and gates. New structures were constructed such as the covered walk and pavilion near the entrance gate.\n\nSan Beda University adopted the \"Red Lion\" emblem from the ancient Scottish/English heraldic symbol, the Red Lion Rampant. The school, named after the Venerable Bede of England, naturally chose the heraldic symbol of the ancient Scots/English for courage. It has been said that the Judeo-Christian roots of the Anglo-Saxon world was preserved by the Benedictines during the Dark Ages through faith and courage. Pope Benedict XVI himself openly declared that the Benedictines saved Europe's Christian roots. San Beda pays tribute to the courage of the Benedictine monks by adopting the Red Lion, the symbol of courage in the Catholic tradition and in the land of St. Bede. It has to be noted that the Benedictines are a key part of the history of Great Britain itself.\n\nBefore the beginning of the 1960s, Bedans were singing a different school hymn. In 1966, Senator Raul Roco, then a San Beda Magna Cum Laude law student; Arturo Montesa, wrote a new alma mater hymn which would capture the Bedan spirit. After finishing the lyrics, Roco then gave the lyrics to Rev. Fr. Benildus Ma (Manuel) Maramba, OSB for its melody, arrangements, and orchestration. It took Fr. Maramba two days to finish the song composition.\n\nIt is sung at important events such as the NCAA basketball season, the Bar exams, alumni gatherings, and at simple affairs such as seminars and small get-together of Bedans.\n\nThe practice of adopting a school moniker became both fashionable and an imperative especially for Catholic school named after Saints during the 1940s in the Philippines. The American Catholic schools started the rage earlier when the clergy became wary of sports headlines such as “ St. Peter mauls St. Paul 80 – 40”. In the Philippines, headlines of whipping and trashing of schools named after saints drew mixed emotions among the clergy and devout Catholics. “Why would a Catholic saint whip another Catholic saint?”, they would ask.\n\nOn July 31, 1940, Fr. Sergio Martinez OSB, inspired by English tradition, coined the moniker “Red Lion” for the school. Red is the color of courage, of a warrior and a martyr. The lion, on the other hand, represents dominance as the king of the jungle.\n\nThe Cuerba brothers, both Bedans, composed the Indian Yell in 1947 after the liberation from the Japanese empire. The Indian Yell was initially solely performed on drums accompanied by cheers from the students. However, this made the cheer somewhat lacking in power and needed something to rejuvenate the audience. So they changed the sound of the yell and incorporated a horn section. Accompanied by the tomahawk chop, the Indian Yell became more lively, intimidating, and full of spirit.\n\nThe Indian Yell is San Beda's romanticized version of the Indian war whoop. It mimics the native Indian war chants and vocalization techniques designed to intimidate the opponent. North American Indian war chants are verbalization of tunes that implore the great spirits to help them in battle. The romanticized Bedan Indian Yell is believed to have been inspired by the Plains Indian.\n\nThe Indian war whoop gave rise to derivative chants, most especially the Lion's Roar. The Lion's roar, with the simple \"Wooohooo\", mimics chants of Native American Indians. This is an indirect offspring of the Wahoos started by Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia in the 1890s. Bedans popularized this aboriginal Native American form of chanting in the Philippine collegiate league and has spawned variations now used by many other schools.\n\nTo accompany the Indian Yell, the Little Indians were conceptualized by Ramon Ventoza (GS '46, HS '51). Mon Ventosa is the longest serving moderator / instructor of the San Beda College Cheering Association. A cheerleader during his student days in San Beda College, Mon was appointed as instructor of the college's Cheering Squad (1952–1962). He came up with idea to counter the gaining popularity of the dance number of Jose Rizal College.\n\nThere were only three Indians in 1947: Gabriel Gasar and the Casal brothers (one of whom eventually became a Benedictine monk). Slowly, the recruitment process changed and participation from the grade school pupils rose because many wanted to become Little Indians. Tito Mon wanted the Indians to be stout and adorable. From three Indians since 1947, the membership rose to a minimum of eight in the 90s.\n\nOne of the more popular line in the traditional Bedan cheers is \"¡Ánimo San Beda!\".\n\nBedans use \"Ánimo\" to mean courage in their cheers. When Bedans yell “¡Ánimo San Beda!” they actually mean “Courage San Beda!/Have Courage San Beda!\" — faithful to the Spanish idiomatic usage of the word. Animo is a Spanish word which means spirit, energy, vitality, purpose and will. Used as an expression of encouragement by Spanish-speakers, it means courage or have courage. \"¡Avance San Beda!\" and \"\"¡Vamos!\"\" were popular then. In the pre-war Spanish San Beda cheer (also known as \"El Colegio de San Beda Tiene que Ganar!\"), \"\"Ánimo\"\" is included.\n\nAs one of the reputable educational institutions in the Philippines, San Beda University counts among its illustrious roster of students, alumni and graduates numerous national leaders and pioneers in politics, business, law, athletics and entertainment such as the 16th Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Senator Leila de Lima, former senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr., former senator Raul S. Roco, former Speaker Ramon V. Mitra, former senator and human rights icon Rene Saguisag, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion, Associate Justice Florenz Regalado, business tycoon Dr. Manuel V. Pangilinan, real estate and property magnate Ambassador Eduardo Antonino B. Antonio, business tycoon, billionaire and entrepreneur Robet Coyiuto, Philippine basketball legend Carlos Loyzaga, actor Eddie Gutierrez, and 2004 Philippine presidential candidate & actor, Fernando Poe, Jr., and people that have been recognized as one of the top 10 students in the Philippines.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1793994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793994", "title": "Siege of Cawnpore", "text": "Siege of Cawnpore\n\nThe Siege of Cawnpore was a key episode in the Indian rebellion of 1857. The besieged Company forces and civilians in Cawnpore (now Kanpur) were unprepared for an extended siege and surrendered to rebel forces under Nana Sahib, in return for a safe passage to Allahabad. However, their evacuation from Cawnpore turned into a massacre, and most of the men were killed. As an East India Company rescue force from Allahabad approached Cawnpore, 120 British women and children captured by the Sepoy forces were killed in what came to be known as the Bibighar Massacre, their remains being thrown down a nearby well in an attempt to hide the evidence. Following the recapture of Cawnpore and the discovery of the massacre, the angry Company forces engaged in widespread retaliation against captured rebel soldiers and local civilians. The murders greatly embittered the British rank-and-file against the Sepoy rebels and inspired the war cry \"\"Remember Cawnpore!\"\".\n\nCawnpore was an important garrison town for the East India Company forces. Located on the Grand Trunk Road, it lay on the approaches to Sindh (Sind), Punjab and Awadh (Oudh).\n\nBy June 1857, the Indian rebellion had spread to several areas near Cawnpore, namely Meerut, Agra, Mathura, and Lucknow. However, the Indian sepoys at Cawnpore initially remained loyal. The British General at Cawnpore, Hugh Wheeler, knew the local language, had adopted local customs, and was married to an Indian woman. He was confident that the sepoys at Cawnpore would remain loyal to him, and sent two British companies (one each of the 84th and 32nd Regiments) to besieged Lucknow.\n\nThe British contingent in Cawnpore consisted of around nine hundred people, including around three hundred military men, around three hundred women and children, and about one hundred and fifty merchants, business owners, drummers (salesman), engineers and others. The rest were the native servants, who left soon after the commencement of the siege.\n\nIn the case of a rebellion by the sepoys in Cawnpore, the most suitable defensive location for the British was the magazine located in the north of the city. It had thick walls, ample ammunition and stores, and also hosted the local treasury. However, General Wheeler decided to take refuge in the south of the city, in an entrenchment composed of two barracks surrounded by a mud wall. There was a military building site to the south of Cawnpore, where nine barracks were being constructed at the dragoon barracks. The British soldiers found it difficult to dig deep trenches, as it was hot summer season. The area also lacked good sanitary facilities, and there was only one well (which would be exposed to enemy fire in case of an attack). Also, there were several buildings overlooking the entrenchment that would provide cover for the attackers, allowing them to easily shoot down on the defenders.\n\nGeneral Wheeler's choice of this location to make a stand remains controversial, given the availability of safer and more defensible places in Cawnpore. It is believed that he was expecting reinforcements to come from the southern part of the city. He also assumed that, in case of a rebellion, the Indian troops would probably collect their arms, ammunition and money, and would head to Delhi and therefore, he did not expect a long siege.\n\nThe first sign of the rebellion at Cawnpore came in the form of a rebellion at Fatehgarh (or Futteghur), a military station on the banks of the Ganges. To disperse the Indian troops away from Cawnpore, and lessen the chances of a rebellion, General Wheeler decided to send them on various \"missions\". On one such mission, he sent the 2nd Oudh Irregulars to Fatehgarh. On the way to Fatehgarh, General Wheeler's forces under the command of Fletcher Hayes and Lieutenant Barbour met two more Englishmen, Fayrer and Carey.\n\nOn the night of 31 May 1857, Hayes and Carey departed to a nearby town to confer with the local magistrate. After their departure, the Indian troops rebelled and decapitated Fayrer. Barbour was also killed, as he tried to escape. When Hayes and Carey came back the next morning, an older Indian officer galloped towards them and advised them to run away. However, as the Indian officer explained the situation to them, the rebel Indian sowars (cavalry troopers) raced towards them. Hayes was killed as he tried to ride away, while Carey escaped to safety.\n\nThere were four Indian regiments in Cawnpore: the 1st, 53rd and 56th Native Infantry, and the 2nd Bengal Cavalry. Although the sepoys in Cawnpore had not rebelled, the European families began to drift into the entrenchment as the news of rebellion in the nearby areas reached them. The entrenchment was fortified, and the Indian sepoys were asked to collect their pay one by one, so as to avoid an armed mob.\n\nThe Indian soldiers considered the fortification, and the artillery being primed, as a threat. On the night of 2 June 1857, a British officer named Lieutenant Cox fired on his Indian guard while drunk. Cox missed his target, and was thrown into the jail for a night. The very next day, a hastily convened court acquitted him, which led to discontent among the Indian soldiers. There were also rumours that the Indian troops were to be summoned to a parade, where they were to be massacred. All these factors influenced them to rebel against the East India Company rule.\n\nThe rebellion began at 1:30 AM on 5 June 1857, with three pistol shots from the rebel soldiers of the 2nd Bengal Cavalry. Elderly Risaldar-Major Bhowani Singh, who chose not to hand over the regimental colours and join the rebel sepoys, was subsequently cut down by his subordinates. The 53rd and 56th Native Infantry, which were apparently the most loyal units in the area, were awoken by the shootings. Some soldiers of the 56th attempted to leave. The European artillery assumed that they were also rebelling, and opened fire on them. The soldiers of the 53rd were also caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe 1st N.I. rebelled and left in the early morning of 6 June 1857. On the same day, the 53rd N.I. also went off, taking with them the regimental treasure and as much ammunition as they could carry. Around 150 sepoys remained loyal to General Wheeler.\n\nAfter obtaining arms, ammunition and money, the rebel troops started marching towards Delhi to seek further orders from Bahadur Shah II, who had been proclaimed the \"Badshah-e-Hind\" (\"Emperor of India\"). The British officers were relieved, thinking that they would not face a long siege.\n\nNana Sahib was the adopted heir to Baji Rao II, the former peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy. The East India Company had decided that the pension and honours of the lineage would not be passed on to Nana Sahib, as he was not a natural born heir. Nana Sahib had sent his envoy Dewan Azimullah Khan to London, to petition the Queen against the Company's decision, but failed to evoke a favourable response. In May 1857, Nana Sahib arrived in Cawnpore with 300 soldiers, stating that he intended to support the British: Wheeler asked him to take charge of the government treasury in the Nawabganj area.\n\nAmid the chaos in Cawnpore in 1857, Nana Sahib entered the British magazine with his contingent. The soldiers of the 53rd Native Infantry, which was guarding the magazine, were not fully aware of the situation in the rest of the city. They assumed that Nana Sahib had come to guard the magazine on behalf of the British, as he had earlier declared his loyalty to the British, and had even sent some volunteers to be at the disposal of General Wheeler. However, Nana Sahib joined the rebels.\n\nAfter taking possession of the treasury, Nana Sahib advanced up the Grand Trunk Road. His aim was to restore the Maratha Confederacy under Peshwa tradition, and he decided to capture Cawnpore. On his way, Nana Sahib met with rebel soldiers at Kalyanpur. The soldiers were on their way to Delhi, to meet Bahadur Shah II. Nana Sahib initially decided to march to Delhi and fight the British as a Mughal subordinate, but Azimullah Khan advised him that leading the rebels in Kanpur would increase his prestige more than serving a weak Muslim king.\n\nNana Sahib asked the rebel soldiers to go back to Cawnpore, and help him in defeating the British. The rebels were reluctant at first, but decided to join Nana Sahib, when he promised to double their pay and reward them with gold, if they were to destroy the British entrenchment.\n\nOn 5 June 1857, Nana Sahib sent a polite note to General Wheeler, informing him that he intended to attack on the following morning, at 10 AM. On 6 June Nana Sahib's forces (including the rebel soldiers) attacked the British entrenchment at 10:30 AM. The British were not adequately prepared for the attack, but managed to defend themselves for a long time, as the attacking forces were reluctant to enter the entrenchment. Nana Sahib's forces had been led to falsely believe that the entrenchment had gunpowder-filled trenches that would explode if they got closer.\n\nAs the news of Nana Sahib's advances against the British garrison spread, several of the rebel sepoys joined him. By 10 June, he was believed to be leading around twelve thousand to fifteen thousand Indian soldiers.\n\nThe British held out in their makeshift fort for three weeks with little water and food supplies. Many died as a result of sunstroke and lack of water. As the ground was too hard to dig graves, the British would pile the dead bodies of their killed outside the buildings, and drag and dump them inside a dried well during the night. The lack of sanitation facilities led to spread of diseases such as dysentery and cholera, further weakening the defenders. There was also a small outbreak of smallpox, although this was relatively confined.\n\nDuring the first week of the siege, Nana Sahib's forces encircled the entrenchment, created loopholes and established firing positions in the surrounding buildings. Captain John Moore of the 32nd (Cornwall) Light Infantry countered this by launching night-time sorties. Nana Sahib withdrew his headquarters to Savada House (or Savada \"Kothi\"), situated about two miles away. In response to Moore's sorties, Nana Sahib decided to attempt a direct assault on the British entrenchment, but the rebel soldiers displayed a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nOn 11 June, Nana Sahib's forces changed their tactics. They started concentrated firing on specific buildings, firing endless salvos of round shot into the entrenchment. They successfully damaged some of the smaller barrack buildings, and also tried to set fire to the buildings.\n\nThe first major assault by Nana Sahib's side took place on the evening of 12 June. However, the attacking soldiers were still convinced that the British had laid out gunpowder-filled trenches, and did not enter the area. On 13 June, the British lost their hospital building to a fire, which destroyed most of their medical supplies and caused the deaths of a number of wounded and sick artillerymen who burned alive in the inferno. The loss of the hospital was a major blow to the defenders. Nana Sahib's forces gathered for an attack, but were repulsed by the canister shots from artillery under the command of Lieutenant George Ashe. By 21 June, the British had lost around a third of their numbers.\n\nWheeler's repeated messages to Henry Lawrence, the commanding officer in Lucknow, could not be answered as that garrison was itself under siege.\n\nThe sniper fire and the bombardment continued until 23 June 1857, the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Plassey, which took place on 23 June 1757 and was one of the pivotal battles leading to the expansion of British rule in India. One of the driving forces of the sepoy rebellion was a prophecy which predicted the downfall of East India Company rule in India exactly one hundred years after the Battle of Plassey. This prompted the rebel soldiers under Nana Sahib to launch a major attack on the British entrenchment on 23 June 1857.\n\nThe rebel soldiers of the 2nd Bengal Cavalry led the charge, but were repulsed with canister shot when they approached within 50 yards of the British entrenchment. After the cavalry assault, the soldiers of the 1st Native Infantry launched an attack on the British, advancing behind cotton bales and parapets. They lost their commanding officer, Radhay Singh, to the opening volley from the British. They had hoped to get protection from cotton bales; however, the bales caught fire from the canister shot, and became a hazard to them. On the other side of the entrenchment, some of the rebel soldiers engaged in a hand combat against 17 British men led by Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson. By the end of the day, the attackers were unable to gain an entry into the entrenchment. The attack left over 25 rebel soldiers dead, with very few casualties on the British side.\n\nThe British garrison had taken heavy losses as a result of successive bombardments, sniper fire, and assaults. It was also suffering from disease and low supplies of food, water and medicine. General Wheeler's personal morale had been low, after his son Lieutenant Gordon Wheeler was decapitated by a roundshot. With approval of General Wheeler, a Eurasian civil servant called Jonah Shepherd slipped out of the entrenchment in disguise to ascertain the condition of Nana Sahib's forces. He was quickly imprisoned by the rebel soldiers.\n\nAt the same time, Nana Sahib's forces were wary of entering the entrenchment, as they believed that it had gunpowder-filled trenches. Nana Sahib and his advisers came up with a plan to end the deadlock. On 24 June, they sent a female European prisoner, Mrs Rose Greenway, to the entrenchment with their message. In return for surrender, Nana Sahib promised the safe passage of the British to the Satichaura Ghat, a landing on the Ganges from which they could depart for Allahabad. General Wheeler rejected the offer, because it had not been signed, and there was no guarantee that the offer was made by Nana Sahib himself.\n\nThe next day, 25 June, Nana Sahib sent a second note, signed by himself, through another elderly female prisoner, Mrs Jacobi. The British camp divided into two groups – one in favour of continuing the defence, while the second group was willing to trust Nana Sahib. During the next 24 hours, there was no bombardment by Nana Sahib's forces. Finally, General Wheeler decided to surrender, in return for a safe passage to Allahabad. After a day of preparation, and burying their dead, the British decided to leave for Allahabad on the morning of 27 June 1857.\n\nOn the morning of the 27 June, a large British column led by General Wheeler emerged from the entrenchment. Nana Sahib sent a number of carts, dolis and elephants to enable the women, the children and the sick to proceed to the river banks. The British officers and military men were allowed to take their arms and ammunition with them, and were escorted by nearly the whole of the rebel army. The British reached the Satichaura Ghat by 8 AM. Nana Sahib had arranged around forty boats, belonging to a boatman called Hardev Mallah, for their departure to Allahabad.\n\nThe Ganges river was unusually dry at the Satichaura Ghat, and the British found it difficult to drift the boats away. General Wheeler and his party were the first aboard and the first to manage to set their boat off. There was some confusion, as the Indian boatmen jumped overboard after hearing bugles from the banks, and started swimming toward the shore. As they jumped, some fires on the boats were knocked over, setting a few of the boats ablaze.\n\nThough controversy surrounds what exactly happened next at the Satichaura Ghat, and who fired the first shot, soon afterwards, the departing British were attacked by the rebel sepoys, and were either killed or captured.\n\nSome of the British officers later claimed that the rebels had placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, on purpose to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana Sahib's camp had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the British. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of the betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had pre-planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Satichaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion, and not of any plan implemented by Nana Sahib and his associates. Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the four male survivors of the massacre, believed that the rank-and-file sepoys who spoke to him did not know of the killing to come.\n\nAfter the fighting began, Nana Sahib's general Tatya Tope allegedly ordered the 2nd Bengal Cavalry unit and some artillery units to open fire on the British. The rebel cavalry sowars moved into the water, to kill the remaining British soldiers with swords and pistols. The surviving men were killed, while the women and children were taken into captivity, as Nana Sahib did not approve of their killing. Around 120 women and children were taken prisoner and escorted to Savada House, Nana Sahib's headquarters during the siege.\n\nBy this time, two of the boats had been able to drift away: General Wheeler's boat, and a second boat which was holed beneath the waterline by a round shot fired from the bank. The British people in the second boat panicked and attempted to make it to General Wheeler's boat, which was slowly drifting to safer waters.\n\nGeneral Wheeler's boat had around sixty people aboard, and was being pursued down the riverbanks by the rebel soldiers. The boat frequently grounded on the sandbanks. On one such sandbank, Lieutenant Thomson led a charge against the rebel soldiers, and was able to capture some ammunition. Next morning, the boat again stuck on a sandbank, resulting in another charge by Thomson and eleven British soldiers. After a fierce fight on shore, Thomson and his men decided to return to the boat, but did not find it where they expected to.\n\nMeanwhile, the rebels had launched an attack on the boat from the opposite bank. After some firing, the British men on the boat decided to fly the white flag. They were escorted off the boat and taken back to Savada house. The surviving British men were sat on the ground, and Nana Sahib's soldiers got ready to fire on them. Their wives insisted that they would die with their husbands, but were pulled away. Nana Sahib granted the British chaplain Moncrieff's request to read prayers before they died. The British were initially wounded by the guns, and then killed with swords. The women and children were confined to Savada House, to be reunited later with their remaining colleagues, who had been captured earlier, at Bibighar.\n\nBeing unable to find the boat, Thomson's party decided to run barefoot to evade the rebel soldiers. The party took refuge in a small shrine, where Thomson led a last charge. Six of the British soldiers were killed, while the rest managed to escape to the riverbank, where they tried to escape by jumping into the river and swimming to safety. However, a group of rebels from the village started clubbing them as they reached the bank. One of the soldiers was killed, while the other four, including Thomson, swam back to the centre of the river. After swimming downstream for a few hours, they reached shore, where they were discovered by some Rajput matchlockmen, who worked for Raja Dirigibijah Singh, a British loyalist. These carried the British soldiers to the Raja's palace. These four British soldiers were the only male survivors from the British side, apart from Jonah Shepherd (who had been captured by Nana Sahib before the surrender). The four men included two privates named Murphey and Sullivan, Lieutenant Delafosse, and Lieutenant (later Captain) Mowbray Thomson. The men spent several weeks recuperating, eventually making their way back to Cawnpore which was, by that time, back under British control. Murphey and Sullivan both died shortly after from cholera, Delafosse went on to join the defending garrison during the Siege of Lucknow, and Thomson took part in rebuilding and defending the entrenchment a second time under General Windham, eventually writing a firsthand account of his experiences entitled \"The Story of Cawnpore\" (London, 1859).\n\nAnother survivor of the Satichaura Ghat massacre was Amy Horne, a 17-year-old Anglo-Indian girl. She had fallen from her boat and had been swept downstream during the riverside massacre. Soon after scrambling ashore she met up with Wheeler's youngest daughter, Margaret. The two girls hid in the undergrowth for a number of hours until they were discovered by a group of rebels. Margaret was taken away on horseback, never to be seen again (it was later rumoured that she survived and was married to a Muslim soldier) and Amy was led to a nearby village where she was taken under the protection of a Muslim rebel leader in exchange for converting to Islam. Just over six months later, she was rescued by Highlanders from Sir Colin Campbell's column on their way to relieve Lucknow.\n\nThe surviving British women and children were moved from the Savada House to Bibighar (\"The House of the Ladies\"), a villa-type house in Cawnpore. Initially, around 120 women and children were confined to Bibighar. They were later joined by some other women and children, the survivors from General Wheeler's boat. Another group of British women and children from Fatehgarh, and some other captive European women were also confined to Bibighar. In total, there were around 200 women and children in Bibighar.\n\nNana Sahib placed the care of these survivors under a sex worker called Hussaini Khanum (also known as Hussaini Begum). She put the captives to grinding corn for \"chapatis\". Poor sanitary conditions at Bibighar led to deaths from cholera and dysentery.\n\nNana Sahib decided to use these prisoners for bargaining with the East India Company. The Company forces, consisting of around 1,000 British, 150 Sikh soldiers and 30 irregular cavalry, had set out from Allahabad, under the command of General Henry Havelock, to retake Cawnpore and Lucknow. The first relief force assembled under Havelock included 64th Regiment of Foot and 78th Highlanders (brought back from the Anglo-Persian War), the first arrivals of the diverted China expedition, 5th Fusiliers, part of the 90th Light Infantry (seven companies), the 84th (York and Lancaster) from Burma, and EIC Madras European Fusiliers, brought up to Calcutta from Madras. Havelock's initial forces were later joined by the forces under the command of Major Renaud and Colonel James Neill, which had arrived from Calcutta to Allahabad on 11 June. Nana Sahib demanded that the East India Company forces under General Havelock and Colonel Neill retreat to Allahabad. However, the Company forces advanced relentlessly towards Cawnpore. Nana Sahib sent an army to check their advance. The two armies met at Fatehpur on 12 July, where General Havelock's forces emerged victorious and captured the town.\n\nNana Sahib then sent another force under the command of his brother, Bala Rao. On 15 July, the British forces under General Havelock defeated Bala Rao's army in the Battle of Aong, just outside the Aong village. On 16 July, Havelock's forces started advancing to Cawnpore. During the Battle of Aong, Havelock was able to capture some of the rebel soldiers, who informed him that there was an army of 5,000 rebel soldiers with 8 artillery pieces further up the road. Havelock decided to launch a flank attack on this army, but the rebel soldiers spotted the flanking manoeuvre and opened fire. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, but cleared the road to Cawnpore for the British.\n\nBy this time, it became clear that Sahib's bargaining attempts had failed and the Company forces were approaching Cawnpore. Nana Sahib was informed that the British troops led by Havelock and Neill were indulging in violence against the Indian villagers. Pramod Nayar, believes that the ensuing Bibighar massacre was a reaction to the news of violence being perpetrated by the advancing British troops.\n\nNana Sahib, and his associates, including Tatya Tope and Azimullah Khan, debated about what to do with the captives at Bibighar. Some of Nana Sahib's advisors had already decided to kill the captives at Bibighar, as revenge for the executions of Indians by the advancing British forces. The women of Nana Sahib's household opposed the decision and went on a hunger strike, but their efforts went in vain.\n\nFinally, on 15 July, an order was given to murder the women and children imprisoned at Bibighar. The details of the incident, such as who ordered the massacre, are not clear.\n\nThe rebel sepoys executed the four surviving male hostages from Fatehghar, one of them a 14-year-old boy. But they refused to obey the order to kill women and the other children. Some of the sepoys agreed to remove the women and children from the courtyard, when Tatya Tope threatened to execute them for dereliction of duty. Nana Sahib left the building because he didn't want to be a witness to the unfolding massacre.\n\nThe British women and children were ordered to come out of the assembly rooms, but they refused to do so and clung to each other. They barricaded themselves in, tying the door handles with clothing. At first, around twenty rebel soldiers opened fire from the outside of the Bibighar, firing through holes in the boarded windows. The soldiers of the squad that was supposed to fire the next round were disturbed by the scene, and discharged their shots into the air. Soon after, upon hearing the screams and groans inside, the rebel soldiers threw down their weapons and declared that they were not going to kill any more women and children.\n\nAn angry Begum Hussaini Khanum denounced the sepoys' act as cowardice, and asked her aide to finish the job of killing the captives. Her lover hired butchers, who murdered the captives with cleavers; the butchers left when it seemed that all the captives had been killed. However, a few women and children had managed to survive by hiding under the other dead bodies. It was agreed that the bodies of the victims would be thrown down a dry well by some sweepers. The next morning the rebels arrived to dispose of the bodies and they found that three women who were still alive, and also three children aged between four and seven years old . The surviving women were cast into the well by the sweepers, who had also been told to strip the corpses. The sweepers then threw the three little boys into the well one at a time, the youngest first. Some victims, among them small children, were therefore buried alive in a heap of butchered corpses. None survived.\n\nThe Company forces reached Cawnpore on 16 July, and captured the city. A group of British officers and soldiers set out to the Bibighar, to rescue the captives, assuming that they were still alive. However, when they reached the site, they found it empty and blood-splattered, with the bodies of most of the 200 women and children having already been dismembered and thrown down the courtyard well or into the Ganges river. Piles of children's clothing and severed women's hair blew on the wind and lodged in tree branches around the compound; the tree in the courtyard nearest the well was smeared with the brains of numerous children and infants who had been dashed headfirst against the trunk and thrown down the well.\n\nThe British troops were horrified and enraged. Upon learning of the massacre, the infuriated British garrison engaged in a surge of violence against the local population of Cawnpore, including looting and burning of houses, with the justification that none of the local noncombatants had done anything to stop the massacre. Brigadier General Neill, who took the command at Cawnpore, immediately began a program of swift and vicious drumhead military justice (culminating in summary execution) for any sepoy rebel captured from the city who was unable to prove he was not involved in the massacre. Rebels confessing to or believed to be involved in the massacre were forced to lick the floor of the Bibighar compound, after it had been wetted with water by low caste people, while being whipped. The sepoys were then religiously disgraced by being forced to eat (or force fed) beef (if Hindu) or pork (if Muslim). The Muslim sepoys were sewn into pig skins before being hanged, and low-caste Hindu street sweepers were employed to execute the high-caste Brahmin rebels to add additional religious disgrace to their punishment. Some were also forced by the British to lick clean buildings stained with the blood of the recently deceased, before being publicly hanged.\n\nMost of the prisoners were hanged within direct view of the well at the Bibighar and buried in shallow ditches by the roadside. Others were shot or bayonetted, while some were also tied across cannons that were then fired, an execution method initially used by the rebels, and the earlier Indian powers, such as the Marathas and the Mughals. It is unclear whether this method of execution was reserved for special prisoners, or whether it was merely done in the retributive spirit of the moment.\n\nThe massacre disgusted and embittered the British troops in India, with \"Remember Cawnpore!\" becoming a war cry for the British soldiers for the rest of the conflict. Acts of summary violence against towns and cities believed to harbour or support the rebellion also increased. In one of the villages, the Highlanders caught around 140 men, women and children. Ten men were hanged without any evidence or trial. Another sixty men were forced to build the gallows of wooden logs, while others were flogged and beaten. In another village, when around 2,000 villagers came out in protest brandishing lathis, the British troops surrounded them and set the village on fire. Villagers trying to escape were shot dead.\n\nMass rapes of Indian women were also reported by sources. Drunk British soldiers, enraged at the reports of atrocities committed against British civilians, committed mass rapes against the native women of Cawnpore.\n\nOn 19 July, General Havelock resumed operations at Bithoor. Major Stevenson led a group of Madras Fusiliers and Sikh soldiers to Bithoor and occupied Nana Sahib's palace without any resistance. The British troops seized guns, elephants and camels, and set Nana Sahib's palace on fire.\n\nIn November 1857, Tatya Tope gathered an army, mainly consisting of the rebel soldiers from the Gwalior contingent, to recapture Cawnpore. By 19 November, his 6,000-strong force had taken control of all the routes west and north-west of Cawnpore. However, his forces were defeated by the Company forces under Colin Campbell in the Second Battle of Cawnpore, marking the end of the rebellion in the Cawnpore area. Tatya Tope then joined Rani Lakshmibai.\n\nNana Sahib disappeared and, by 1859, he had reportedly fled to Nepal. His ultimate fate was never determined. Up until 1888, there were rumours and reports that he had been captured and a number of individuals turned themselves in to the British claiming to be the aged Nana. As the majority of these reports turned out to be untrue, further attempts at apprehending him were abandoned.\n\nBritish civil servant Jonah Shepherd, who had been rescued by Havelock's army, spent the next few years after the rebellion attempting to put together a list of those killed in the entrenchment. He had lost his entire family during the siege. He eventually retired to a small estate north of Cawnpore in the late 1860s.\n\nAfter the revolt was suppressed, the British dismantled Bibighar. They raised a memorial railing and cross at the site of the well in which the bodies of the British women and children had been dumped. Meanwhile, the British forces conducted a punitive action under the lead of General Autrum by blowing down Nana Sahib's palace in Bithoor with cannons, in which Indian women and children including Nana Sahib's young daughter Mainavati were burned alive. Also, the inhabitants of Cawnpore were forced to pay £30,000 for the creation of the memorial as a 'punishment' for not coming to the aid of the British women and children in Bibighar. \"The Angel of the Resurrection\" was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti and completed in 1865. It has been called by various names throughout the centuries and came to be the most visited statue of British India. The chief proponent and private funder was Charlotte, Countess Canning, wife of the first Viceroy of India, Earl Canning. She approached her childhood friend, Marochetti, for models. In turn, Marochetti suggested that other sculptors be invited. Following the Countess's death, Earl Canning took over the commission. Canning rejected a number of designs accepting, in the end, a version of Marochetti's Crimean War memorial at Scutari, Turkey. The understated figure is an angel holding two branches of palm fronds across her chest. Despite assurances, 'The Angel' had some damage during the Independence celebrations of 1947 and she was later moved from her original site over the Bibi Ghar well to a garden at the side of All Soul's Church, Kanpore (Kanpur Memorial Church).\n\nThe remains of a circular ridge of the well can still be seen at the Nana Rao Park, built after Indian independence. The British also erected the All Souls Memorial Church, in memory of the victims. An enclosed pavement outside the church marks the graves of over 70 British men captured and executed on 1 July 1857, four days after the Satichaura Ghat massacre. The marble Gothic screen with \"mournful seraph\" was transferred to the churchyard of the All Souls Church after Indian independence in 1947. The memorial to the British victims was replaced with a bust of Tatya Tope.\n\nThere is a plaque to Capt. W Morphy and Lieut. Thomas Mackinnon who were killed on 28 November 1857 in Lichfield Cathedral.\n\nAn additional memorial detailing the losses suffered by the 32nd Cornwall Regiment Light Infantry is located inside the west entrance to Exeter Cathedral.\n\nMany references to the event were made in later novels and films. Julian Rathbone describes the brutality of both British and Indian forces during the siege of Cawnpore in his novel \"The Mutiny\". In the novel, the Indian nurse Lavanya rescues an English child, Stephen, during the Satichaura Ghat massacre. In \"Massacre at Cawnpore\", V. A. Stuart describes the siege and the British defence through the eyes of the characters Sheridan, and his wife Emmy. George MacDonald Fraser's \"Flashman in the Great Game\" also contains lengthy scenes set in the entrenchment during the siege and also during the ensuing escape.\nTom Williams' novel, \"Cawnpore\", is also set against the background of the siege and massacre, which is seen from both the European and the Indian perspective.\nThe contemporary Indian report by Kalpi devi in the local journal Hindupanch covered the incident of the punitive action by the British and burning down of Nana Sahib's palace along with his young daughter Mainavati in a prose. \n\nThe British press used it to describe the brutality involved in the public feeding of reptiles at the London zoological garden. In 1876, the Editor of the Animal World drew Dr. P L Sclater's attention to this and the press charged the Zoological Society of London with encouraging cruelty, \"pandering to public brutality\" while one writer in the Whitehall Review (27 April 1878), protested against \"the Cawnpore Massacre enacted diurnally,\" and headed his article, \"Sepoyism at the Zoo.\"\n\n\n"}

It is one of the \"economically important districts\" in Bangladesh. Its administrative capital is the eponymous Pabna town.\n\nArcheologist Cunningham conjectured that the name \"Pabna\" might be derived from the Pundra or Poondrobordhon civilisation, whose capital was Mahasthangarh, the oldest city of Bangladesh, in neighbouring Bogra, but this hypothesis has not received general acceptance among scholars.\n\nIn 1859–61, the district was one of the major areas involved in the Indigo revolt. Beginning in \"Yusufshahi\" period in 1873, the serfs resisted excessive demands of increased rents by feudal lords (\"zamindar\"), led by the \"nouveau riches\" Banerjees and Dwijendranath Tagore, by forming an Agrarian League. This largely peaceful movement found the support of the Lieutenant-governor of Bengal, George Campbell, who antagonised the absentee feudal lords. These protests are generally referred to as Pabna disturbances. In the following year, the district was one of the worst hit by famine. The peasants' demands were finally partially met with the Rent Law Act of 1885.\n\nIn 1875, Raaygonj was transferred back to Pabna from Bogra, and in 1879, a separate judgeship for the districts of Pabna and Bogra was created.\nThe history of Pabna was written by Advocate Chowdhury Mohammad Badruduzza.\nSharir\n\nOf the 2.1 million inhabitants, 51.17% are male; 90.12% are Muslims, 9.50% are Hindu, 0.22% are Christian, and 0.16% are other. The district has 2353 mosques, 420 Hindu temples, and 11 churches. No Buddhist pagoda is in Pabna.\nSree Sree Thakur Anukulchandra Aasrom (missionary) beside Mental Hospital, Pabna at Hemayetpur has the largest Hindu temple in Pabna.\n\nPabna forms the south-east boundary of Rajshahi Division. Sirajganj District is on the north-east, while the Padma River, main stream of the holy river Ganges, in the south separates it from Rajbari District and Kushtia District. The Jamuna River runs along its eastern border separating it from Manikgonj District; and on the north-west, it has a common boundary with the Natore District. Its average maximum temperature is 36.8 °C, and the minimum is 9.6 °C; annual rainfall is 1872 mm. Characteristically, the soil of the district is divided into four, due to the flood plains of the Ganges, Karatoya, Jamuna, and Barind Tracts. Its main rivers are the Ganges, Ichamati, Gumani, Baral, and Hurasagar Rivers.\n\nThe district is intersected by rivers of varying magnitude. The river system, though, is constituted by the Padma and the Jamuna with their interlacing offshoots and tributaries.\nBesides these flowing streams, the interiorhas the abandoned beds of old rivers, most of which are dry except in the rains.\nThe general trend of the drainage of the Serajganj subdivision is from north-west to south-east, with the rivers entering it from the north-west flow into the Jamuna after a tortuous course. In the Sadar subdivision, however, the general slope of the country is from west to east, and the main rivers fall into Hurasagar, an offshoot of the Jamuna.\n\nThe following rivers flow through Pabna District:\n\n\nWater from the river Jamuna is pumped from Bera pump house to the east through the Baral river.\n\nPakshey is a popular green area and a small town. The railway colony of Paksey, divisional headquarters of Bangladesh Railway, has many old trees, and is beside the river Padma and the Hardinge Bridge. An export processing zone (EPZ) and the newly built Lalon Shah Bridge are situated here.\n\nIdyllic \"Poddar Par\" (the bank of the Padma) at Shilaaidoho Ghaat is 5 km south of town's old Technical Institute, where people can enjoy a river cruise. A river crossing (\"ghaat\") here connects to Shilaaidoho of Kumarkhali Upazila of Kushtia District. Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore had a \"Koothibari\" (villa) at Shilaaidoho, where his birth anniversary is celebrated regularly.\n\nBangladesh Mental Hospital, Pabna is a hospital beside Pabna's main town, and the only mental hospital in Bangladesh. Mental patients from anywhere in Bangladesh to there to get treatment.\n\nThere is a marshy area, Chalan Beel, in the north.\n\nDhalarchar (Aminpur) was famous for crime, but it is now popular and valuable for its geographical position after established Aminpur Thana.\n\nThe district comprises nine upazilas:\n\nA general hospital and a mental hospital are at Pabna. The 11 \"thanas\" of the district hold a Upazila health complex each. Each Upazila health complex has qualified doctors who got appointment through Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) commission. For better treatment, people need to go to medical college and other tertiary hospitals in Rajshahi or Dhaka.\nThe 250-bed government general hospital is here, with a 450-bed mental hospital, second oldest in Indian subcontinent, only after Ranchi Mental Hospital, Jharkhand, India. Recently, government-owned Pabna Medical College and Hospital has been set up. Around 15 health clinics are available.\n\nMental Hospital, Pabna and Pabna Medical College and Hospital are built on land donated by Lord Thakur Anukulchandra at Hemayetpur.\n\nCentre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed has started its 10th subcenter at Pabna in the name of “CRP- Pabna Diabetic Shamity” from January 2017 with the collaboration of Pabna Diabetic Shamity to provide rehabilitation services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, awareness raising program regarding disability and rehabilitation, and scarf-injury prevention, and also provide assistive devices to the persons with disabilities.\n\nRoads, waterways, railways, and one airport are present. The traditional \"paalkee\" (sedans), \"tomtom\" (horse carriages), and \"gorur gaari\" (bullock carts) are now going out of the fashion. The \"nosimon\" and \"korimon\", locally made mechanical haulers using irrigation pumps as their main engines, are mainly used for transporting agricultural goods and rural folks. Inexpensive Chinese electric and petrol autobikes (tricycles) are gaining popularity as urban transport. Dhaka is about five hours by road. \nHardinge Bridge and Lalon Shah Bridge over the Padma linked Pabna with Kushtia District and Khulna Division, and the southern Bangladesh. Before the Partition of India, it was a major stoppage for trains from Kolkata to Assam and Darjeeling. The Hardinge Bridge already passed a glorious and historical hundred years. Pabna is also connected to Dhaka by the age old roadway through the Jamuna River crossing at Nogorbari, opposite to the river crossing of Aricha at Manikgonj District. It is also very well communicated with Dhaka by modern roads through Jamuna Bridge.

It is notable for being the site of Los Angeles City College, Barnsdall Park and a hospital district. There are seven public and five private schools, as well as a branch of the Los Angeles Public Library and three hospitals. Almost two-thirds of the people living there were born outside the United States and 90% were renters. In 2000 the neighborhood had high percentages of never-married people and of single parents.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the East Hollywood area was a farming village that also encompassed some of what is now Los Feliz. Parts of the neighborhood were formerly known as \"Prospect Park.\"\n\nIn 1910 the towns of Hollywood and East Hollywood approved annexation to the City of Los Angeles in order to tap into the city water supply. In 1914, Children's Hospital was relocated from downtown LA to Vermont Avenue and Sunset Boulevard.\nIn 1916 steel magnate Andrew Carnegie donated the money to construct the Cahuenga Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library on Santa Monica Boulevard.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Barnsdall Park was built. The 1920s were also a time of massive immigration into East Hollywood. Armenian immigrants established the community that is now Little Armenia. The University of California Southern Branch, needing more space, moved west at the end of the 1920s to a ranch called Westwood and became UCLA. The old Southern Branch campus then became Los Angeles Junior College, which was later renamed Los Angeles City College.\n\nIn 1930 Cedars of Lebanon Hospital was formed when Kaspare Cohn Hospital moved from East Los Angeles to a new building on Fountain Avenue and was renamed.\n\nUS 101, the Hollywood Freeway, was built between 1947 and 1949.\n\nIn the summer of 1999 three Metro Red Line subway stations opened, connecting East Hollywood more efficiently to the rest of the city.\n\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 73,967 residents in the 2.38-square-mile East Hollywood neighborhood—or 31,095 people per square mile, the third-highest population density in the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 78,192 - or 32,853 people per square mile.

His parents were Rev. Richard Seymour Conway Chermside, rector of Wilton and son of Sir Robert Alexander Chermside, and Emily Dawson. He was a scholar at Eton College and then attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he graduated at the top of his year and was commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1870.\n\nIn 1871, Chermside and several other officers visited Paris during the Paris Commune, and were accused of supporting the Communards, narrowly escaping execution. After a posting in Ireland, he joined Benjamin Leigh Smith's expedition to the Arctic in 1873.\n\nIn 1876, Chermside was sent to Ottoman Turkey to work with the Turkish forces after Serbia and Montenegro declared war on the country in July. He was working as a military attaché to Turkey in 1877, when Russia also declared war. After six months with the Turkish boundary commission, he was appointed Military Vice Consul to Anatolia in July 1879.\n\nIn 1882, Chermside was promoted to captain, and appointed to the British Army's intelligence staff in Egypt. He was given command of the Egyptian Army's 1st Battalion by the army's Sirdar, Evelyn Wood, and spent four years in Egypt where he took part in the Suakin Expedition of 1884, against Muhammad Ahmad's Mahdist forces and served as governor-general of the Red Sea littoral. He was transferred to Wadi Halfa in October 1886, and spent the next two years repelling Mahdist incursions at Sarras.\n\nAlthough still a captain in the Royal Engineers, Chermside was brevetted major in 1883, lieutenant colonel in 1884 and colonel in 1887. In 1888 he returned to consular duties, spending a year in Kurdistan and seven years as military attaché to Constantinople. He then was assigned to reorganise the gendarmerie of the newly-autonomous Cretan State, later taking command of the British troops there and serving as military commissioner from 1896.\n\nIn 1899 Chermside returned to Britain, but was soon sent to South Africa to command the 14th Brigade and the 3rd Division during the Second Boer War. He was back in the United Kingdom to take up command of the Curragh Camp in Ireland from January 1901. In January the following year he was, however, appointed the first post-Federation Governor of Queensland.\n\nChermside arrived in Australia in early March 1902, landing in Fremantle. On arrival he stated to local reporters that one of the first matters to which the Australian Commonwealth should attend, was the formation of a military college. He arrived in Brisbane on 24 March 1902 to find Queensland in the grip of a drought and economic recession. He immediately volunteered to forgo 15 per cent of his vice-regal salary, and his sacrifice and approachable nature made him a popular figure amongst the Queensland public. However, concerned by the parliamentary attitude to the role of governor, Chermside decided to resign in 1904, although he delayed the announcement until a political crisis had been dealt with by granting a dissolution of parliament to Premier Sir Arthur Morgan after several failed attempts to establish a stable government. Once he had opened the new parliament, Chermside announced his retirement and left Queensland on 8 October on pre-retirement leave.\n\nChermside was the second son of the rector of Wilton, Reverend Richard Seymour Conway Chermside, and his wife, Emily Dawson. His paternal grandfather was the military surgeon Sir Robert Chermside.\n\nChermside was married twice. His first marriage was in 1899 to Geraldine Katherine Webb, daughter of W. F. Webb, of Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. They had a stillborn son on 9 October 1902 in Brisbane, and she childless died in 1910. He remarried in 1920 to Clementine Maria Reuter (daughter of Paul Reuter), and there were no children of the marriage.\n\nChermside retired from the British Army in 1907 at the rank of lieutenant general. He died in London, aged 79, on 24 September 1929.\n\nChermside was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1886. He was also made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1880, upgraded to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1897, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1899.\n\nThe Brisbane suburb of Chermside is named after in Chermside's honour.\n"}

The San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad was established in October 1984 and is owned and operated by Genesee & Wyoming, a holding company that operates more than 100 shortline railroads like the SD&IV.\n\nThe San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad was established after March 8, 1984 when RailTex signed an agreement with Metropolitan Transit Development Board (known as the Metropolitan Transit System after 2005) to operate freight service across its San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) had purchased the railroad from the financially struggling Southern Pacific Railroad in August 1979 with plans to convert the Main Line between San Diego and San Ysidro for use by light rail passenger trains and to preserve rail freight services between the Port of San Diego and the Imperial Valley. The MTDB initially signed an agreement with Kyle Railways to operate the line, but a storm in January 1980 damaged the Desert Line (between the Mexico–United States border in Tecate and Plaster City) and the portion of the line between Tijuana and Tecate (owned by another company) which wasn't repaired until January 1983. Just six months after the line reopened, a fire on June 18, 1983 destroyed two bridges on the Desert Line. After the fire, Kyle Railways petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to abandon the railway, a request that was denied on April 25, 1984.\n\nRailTex’s application to operate freight service along the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway was approved by the ICC on August 9, 1984 and the San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad began operation on October 15, 1984. The new general manager of the SD&IV, Dick Engle, persuaded local carriers to ship on this line and invited Mexican customers to start receiving shipments. The effort was met with much skepticism and took place more than 10 years before the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, that would increase cross-border shipping. On August 1, 1986 the SD&IV entered into a multi-year agreement with the Mexican Government to provide freight service into Baja California.\n\nThe work to repair the Desert Line proved challenging. In July 1989, SD&IV began to repair the burned trestles and collapsed tunnels on the line, but the estimated cost for the work was overwhelming for the railroad and work was halted in the early 1990s. In the early 2000s, investors calling themselves Carrizo Gorge Railway made an offer to make the needed repairs to the Desert Line and pay fees to the SD&IV and the MTDB in exchange for trackage rights. The deal was approved by all parties in April 2003 and repairs on the line began.\n\nIn 2000, the Coronado Branch from the 12th Street Junction in National City to Imperial Beach, CA saw its last shipment. Since then, the line has seen no traffic, and the connection to the Main Line has been removed.\n\nThe Desert Line reopened to freight service in January 2005. By October 2008 the condition of the track had deteriorated to the point that the Carrizo Gorge Railway closed the Desert Line. The Metropolitan Transit System (former MTDB) terminated the deal with Carrizo Gorge Railway in December 2012 and awarded new, long term operating agreement for the Desert Line to the Pacific Imperial Railroad. Earlier that year, on January 1, 2012 the Baja California Railroad assumed control of the line between Tijuana and Tecate which connected SD&IV's Main Line in San Diego with the Desert Line. The Pacific Imperial Railroad spent years negotiating a deal with the Baja California Railroad to transport freight over its tracks, which it said delayed its repairs to the Desert Line. The Pacific Imperial Railroad declared bankruptcy in October 2016. The Baja California Railroad purchased the rights to use the Desert Line in March 2017 with an agreement to pay the Metropolitan Transit System a million dollars per year to retain its lease. Baja California Railroad has made no repairs to the line.\n\nThe San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad holds the exclusive right to operate freight service over three lines owned by the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway: \n\n\nThe San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad no longer holds the rights to operate over the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway's Desert Line in the Imperial Valley. Freight trains only operate between 2 am and 4 am when San Diego Trolley passenger trains are not in operation.\n\nDespite operating on the electrified right-of-way of the San Diego Trolley, the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad uses two NRE 3GS21B diesel-powered genset locomotives instead of electric locomotives, as the rail yards used to marshal the trains have not been electrified. However, genset locomotives are more fuel-efficient and have lower emissions than most traditional diesel locomotives as they are powered by three smaller engines that are turned off and on as needed.\n\nThe overhead electric wires also prevent the double-stacking of shipping containers on rail cars on the line.\n\nThe railroad interchanges with the BNSF Railway in San Diego and the Baja California Railroad in San Ysidro and the railroad's main source of traffic is moving railcars between the two other railroads. The primary commodities hauled are petroleum products, agricultural products, and wood pulp. The SD&IY hauled around 6,500 carloads in 2008.\n\n"}

It is a combination of a middle school (7th and 8th grades) and a high school (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades). The school was founded in 1962 and has an enrollment of approximately 2,500 students. The school covers an area of just over 1,700,000 square feet. According to US News, there are 92 full-time teachers.\n\nIt has been ranked by \"Newsweek\" as one of the top 200 high schools in the United States, and it has been a state champion in several sports. However, it has also been featured in the national media for scandals involving homophobia, sexism, and academic dishonesty.\n\nThe school was founded in 1962. In the mid 1970s, the school went through an extensive design process to develop its media center. The Marian Bergeson Aquatic Center, named for state senator Marian Bergeson who was from Newport Beach, opened in May 1990 at a cost of $1.75 million. In March 2015, a performing arts center was finished. The center cost $16 million and seats more than 360 people.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2014 Corona del Mar was the subject of a series of controversies concerning sexism and homophobia. In February 2009, when a production of the musical \"Rent\" was cancelled, the theater teacher alleged it was due to the principal objecting to the play's depiction of homosexuality. Student demand eventually brought back the play. The following month, after a video surfaced of male students threatening to rape and kill a female peer, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the school for inadequately responding to, allowing, and even condoning an atmosphere of sexist and homophobic violence. A settlement was reached in September, when the District agreed to create and enforce anti-harassment policies and train both students and staff. In May 2014, the school again attracted negative attention for an NFL-style \"prom draft\" in which female students were ceremonially \"drafted\" as dates by their male peers. Writers for the \"Los Angeles Times\" cited a former Corona del Mar High School disciplinarian in their argument that the \"draft\" was the result of a problematic sense of entitlement among Newport Beach residents.\n\nThe school also experienced a series of publicized academic integrity incidents. In 2012, school officials discovered that ten students had bought the answers to their tests from Amazon.com. In early 2014, eleven Corona del Mar High School students were expelled for hacking into school computers with the help of a tutor to alter their grades. The following October, the tutor was arrested on charges of burglary, computer access and fraud. In response to the hacking and \"prom draft\" scandals, the school hired an \"ethics consultant\" in June 2014, with hopes of restoring the school's reputation. The consultant's duties include training the students to accept diversity and be more honest and inclusive.\n\nThe school has been placed on multiple national and state-level lists of \"top schools\". In 2011 \"U.S. News and World Report\" ranked it 127 of 21,786 high schools in math and science and \"Newsweek\" included it as number 172 of the 500 best high schools in the United States. It earned a gold medal from \"U.S. News and World Report\" in 2014, with a national ranking of 222 (37 in California). Niche.com ranked the school #255 out of 19,112 Best College Prep Public High Schools in America in 2019.\n\nCorona del Mar competes in the Sunset Conference of the CIF Southern Section, having moved from the Pacific Coast League following the 2017–2018 season. The Sea Kings have won 81 CIF Southern Section Championships and 12 California Interscholastic Federation State Championships.\n\nThe school opened a $1.75 million aquatic center in 1992. An evening fundraiser in 2007 raised $221,000 for a refurbishment project. They have won the Boys' Water polo southern section divisional title 13 times, including nine Division 1 titles.\n\nThe school has won six State Championships in Girls' Cross Country. In 2010 the boys' soccer team won the SoCal State Championship and finished ranked second in the nation. In 2011 the boys' volleyball team won the Powerade Fab 50 ESPN Rise National championship trophy. The high school also competes in sailing, crew and surfing. Corona del Mar Football won the Division III State Football Championship in 2013.\n\nParent and booster groups annually raise large sums of money for the school and related extracurricular programs, with just three of the projects raising a total of over $235,000 annually.\n\n"}
{"id": "1794033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794033", "title": "Koltsovo International Airport", "text": "Koltsovo International Airport\n\nKoltsovo International Airport () is the international airport serving Yekaterinburg, Russia, located 16 km (10 mi) southeast of the city. Being the largest airport in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Koltsovo also serves nearby towns such as Aramil, Sysert, and Polevskoy. In general, the airport is responsible for serving approximately 4,290,000 people. The airport is a hub for Ural Airlines, RusLine and Aviacon Zitotrans. Due to its location in the center of Russia, Yekaterinburg's airport is included in the \"Priority Airports\" list of Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia).\n\nKoltsovo was officially exploited as a civil Airport on July 10, 1943. Koltsovo is a member of Airports Council International (ACI). In 2014, Koltsovo Airport had a passenger traffic of 4,526,167, a +5.4% increase from that of 2013. Domestic passenger traffic of 2014 made up for 2,407,429 (+11.3%) passengers; international passenger traffic consisted of 2,118,738 (-0.5%) passengers. In 2014 Koltsovo operated 25,531 tonnes of cargo, a -8.1% decrease from that of last year. Koltsovo operated 3,600 tonnes of mail, a 250% increase from that of 2013. In 2013, it handled 4,293,002 passengers and 27,800 tonnes of cargo, representing a +13.5% increase compared to the previous year. The airport is in the top 7 busiest airports in Russia.\n\nConstruction of Koltsovo's original aerodrome was between 1928-1930 by demand of the Air Force Institute of the USSR. It was primarily built as a military aerodrome. In 1932 the 33rd air division, priorly belonging to the Privolzhsky Military District, was transferred to the Koltsovo aerodrome; the division was later redirected to the border with Finland during the Winter War. One day after Nazi Germany declared war on the USSR, entangling the Soviet Union into World War II, construction of a 1 km runway was announced. Construction began the next day and the runway was completed in three months, a record breaking time for the 1940s.\n\nOn May 15, 1942, USSR's first jet engine plane, the BI-1, completed its maiden flight from Koltsovo airport. The new aircraft was manually operated by . Six experimental voyages were conducted on the BI-1, until, on the 7th flight, during maximum speed testing, the pilot lost control of the trajectory of the plane and the plane crashed, resulting in Bakhchivadzhi's death. A 1:1 scale replica of the BI-1 jet plane was recreated in the front square of the airport in honour of the BI-1 and Grigory. The monument still stands.\n\nOn July 10, 1943, the airport gained domestic status. This made Koltsovo the first airport in the USSR to have civil and military status at once. Flights from Yekaterinburg to Moscow were conducted on a daily basis. In December 1943, on the way back from Tehran, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stayed overnight at the Koltsovo airport. During World War II the airport acted as a joint in the classified route between Fairbanks, Alaska and Moscow, Russia, in which C-47 aircraft were imported into the USSR. By January 1944 Koltsovo owned four aircraft, granted by the USSR Ministry of Civil Aviation for the purpose of domestic flights: two LI-2 and two Junkers. After the surrender of Nazi Germany, Koltsovo was used as joint for the relocation of military aircraft to the Pacific Front for the combating of the Japanese Empire. Between 1943-1945, despite the extremely high traffic rates for an airport of such size, no airplane crashes were recorded.\n\nIn 1951 the airfield underwent a reconstruction. In the early 1950s flights from Moscow to Beijing, China, made a layover in Koltsovo. The route from Koltsovo to Beijing was also the airport's first international flight. In 1954 a new terminal completed construction. The Russian Imperial-Modern style and the large spire made this terminal a prominent symbol of Yekaterinburg and all of Sverdlovsk. In 1956 all runways were extended and reinforced with concrete flooring. This allowed for larger aircraft such as the Tu-104 and IL-18 to dock at Koltsovo. In 1958 a hotel with 100 rooms was built 800m from the terminal. The hotel went bankrupt in 1961 and was the demolished the preceding year.\n\nIn 1963 a new 3-star \"Liner\" hotel with 235 rooms completed construction. On January 1, 1967, a new terminal complex was exploited for domestic flights. This terminal was twice as large as the original terminal and had a passenger traffic limit of 1,500,000 passengers and could support 700 pax/hour. The terminal was placed to the right of the original terminal; today, the new Terminal A and B stand where the 1967 terminal stood.\n\nIn 1983 an arrival terminal was built. On March 6, 1987, a second runway completed construction and was exploited. In 1991, due to the dissolution of the USSR, the Sverdlovsk united air group of the Ural Civil Airports Office was reformed to the First Sverdlovsk Airline. In October 1993 Koltsovo was granted international status. On December 28, 1993, as a result of the division and privatization of the First Sverdlovsk Air, two joint-stock companies were set up: OJSC (now JSC) \"Airport Koltsovo\" and JSC \"Ural Airlines\". Later JSC Koltsovo Airport was renamed to JSC \"Koltsovo Invest\", Koltsovo's current owner company.\n\nIn 2003 an implement of the airport development as a hub Program was started with the support of Russian Federation Ministry of Transport, Sverdlovsk Oblast Government and the Renova Group. Investment into the Koltsovo large scale reconstruction of 2003–2009 years estimated about 12,000,000,000 rubles: private investments totaled 8,000,000,000 rubles (to the air-terminal complex development and technical re-equipment of services), state investments totaled 4,000,000,000 rubles (to rebuild aerodrome pavement and control tower building). In 2005 a new international terminal for Yekaterinburg finished construction and was exploited for proper use. The same year Yekaterinburg established new borders of the city, resulting in Koltsovo village, where the airport was located, in becoming part of Yekaterinburg's municipal district. A new catering facility was also implemented in 2005, as well as the international terminal.\n\nIn 2006, the original Koltsovo terminal was converted to a business terminal and underwent a complete renovation. The preceding year, the domestic terminal adjacent to the international terminal completed construction. In 2008 an aeroexpress railway station from the center of Yekaterinburg to Koltsovo finished building. On June 14, 2009, Koltsovo received its first ever jumbo jet: the Air China Boeing 747 with the Chinese delegates. On June 15, 2009, the international terminal was expanded again and opened by the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev in time for the BRICS (then known as BRIC) summit. Additionally in 2009 the 4-star Angelo hotel, new control tower, and a fixed runway were put into exploitation. This enabled the airport to handle all types of heavy aircraft, including the Airbus A380, Airbus A320, Boeing 737, Boeing 747, and Airbus A330 aircraft.\n\nBeginning May 24, 2014, Koltsovo began cooperating with CIS Routes. On July 24, 2012, the airport opened a new cargo terminal with a total area of 19,185 m². The opening ceremony was attended by the governor of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Yevgeny Kuyvashev and Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Alexander Jacob. On June 13, 2013, a new business lounge for domestic passengers was opened.\n\nTerminal A completed construction in 2007. It is used solely as a departures and arrivals facility for domestic flights. The terminal was 19,600 m² and had a capacity of 1,000 pax/hour. Later the 2005 International terminal was joined to Terminal A, making the total area of the terminal 35,000 m² and the capacity of 1600 pax/hour. The terminal is 2 floors in height. The ground floor contains check-in desks, baggage claim areas (with carousels), currency exchange centers, a staff room, and several coffee shops. The second floor has several restaurants, including Grenki Pub, a children's nursery room, and the domestic business lounge which opened on June 13, 2013. The lounge is accessible by passengers with business class tickets or for a fee of 1960 rubles. The terminal has 5 jet bridges and several other bus gates. renovations to the domestic terminal were made as early as of February 18, 2014, with the stylistic and congestion reductional changes. The renovations began in 2012 with NefaResearch design studies winning the bid for the reconstruction, with Phase I completed on December 27, 2012, and Phase II on February 18, 2014. The total price of the renovations was listed at 141,000,000 rubles.\n\nTerminal B original completed construction in 2005, with the total area of 15,400 m² and the capacity of 600 pax/hour. On June 15, 2009, a larger, 45,000 m² international terminal completed construction in time for the BRICS summit, and took the role of Terminal B. The original one was merged with the domestic terminal. Terminal B has a capacity of 1600 pax/hour. The terminal consists of 2 floors and is conjoined to Terminal A. The ground floor houses the check-in desks, a baggage claim area with the baggage carousels, customs control and several retail stores. On the second floor there stand the security control, international business lounge, a duty-free shop, a smoking room and several retail shops. General renovations were made alongside the domestic renovation project. The business terminal was renovated as recent as February 2014.\n\nThe business terminal, otherwise known as the VIP terminal, offers those willing to pay a unique experience. The business terminal is accessible only through direct payment. Prices can range from 8,500 rubles (one pass) to 250,000 rubles (12-month membership). The business terminal is located in Koltsovo's first terminal, built in 1954. The structure has a mix of empire style and Russian neoclassical revival styles, enhancing the royal feel. Inside, the VIP terminal is also styled in neoclassical revival. The business terminal offers separate check-in desks, passport and custom controls. Free WiFi, catering, and delivery to the airplane is also offered. The total area of the VIP terminal is 9,800 m².\n\nThe airport has 2 runways. Runway 1 is 3004х45 m; Runway 2 is 3026х53. Both runways pass the ICAO Category I standards. Both runways are also equipped with OVI-1 lighting facilities and are capable of handling aircraft of any size in any type of weather. Maintenance of the runways has been conducted as recently as of June 2012.\n\nReference:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794046", "title": "Burkhanism", "text": "Burkhanism\n\nBurkhanism or Ak Jang (), is a new religious movement that flourished among the indigenous people of Russia's Gorno-Altai region (\"okrug\") between 1904 and the 1930s. Czarist Russia was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers. The Soviet authorities ultimately suppressed it for fear of its potential to unify Siberian Turkic peoples under a common nationalism.\n\nOriginally millenarian, charismatic and anti-shamanic, the Burkhanist movement gradually lost most of these qualities—becoming increasingly routine, institutionalized (around a hierarchy of oral epic singers) and accommodating itself to the pre-existing Altaian folk religion. It exists today in several revival forms.\n\nOn the whole, the Burkhanist movement was shown to be a syncretistic phenomenon combining elements of ancient pre-Shamanist, Shamanist, Lamaist and Orthodox Christian beliefs. According to a Professor of Tomsk State University L. Sherstova, it emerged in response to the needs of a new people - the Altai-kizhi or Altaians who sought to distinguish themselves from the neighboring and related tribes and for whom Burkhanism became a religious form of their ethnic identity.\n\n\"Burkhanism\" is the usual English-language scholarly name, which has its origin in the Russian academic usage. One of the Burkhanist deities is Ak-Burkhan, or \"White Burkhan.\" \"Burkhan\" means \"\"god\"\" or \"\"buddha\"\" in Mongolic languages, yet Burkhanism is not considered Buddhist, as the term is also used in shamanistic nomenclature. For example, in Mongolian Shamanism, the name of the most sacred mountain, the rumored birthplace and final resting spot of Genghis Khan, is also Burkhan Khaldun. Ak-Burkhan is only one of a pantheon of deities worshiped by Burkhanists (see list below), but Ak-Burkhan nevertheless provides the name of the religion in Russian, and thence into other languages.\n\nThe Altaian name for the religion is \"Ak Jang\" (\"White Faith\"). \"White\" refers to its emphasis on the upper world (in the three-world cosmology of the Turkic and Mongolian Tengriism). Alternatively, the name may also allude to Ak Jang's rejection of animal sacrifices in favor of offerings of horse milk or horse-milk alcohol. \"Jang\" means authority; faith; custom; law or principle; and canon or rules of ensemble. In more colloquial settings, the term may also be used as a \"way of doing things\" and is used in reference to religions as well as political systems.\n\nIn April 1904 Chet Chelpan (or, Chot Chelpanov) and his adopted daughter Chugul Sarok Chandyk reported visions of a rider dressed in white, and riding a white horse. This figure, whom they called Ak-Burkhan (\"White Burkhan\"), announced the imminent arrival of the mythical messianic hero Oirat Khan who was actually a real historical figureKhoit-Oirat prince Amursana. The central figure in the research of Burkhanism in the past forty years, however, has demonstrated that Oirot-khan is a mythologized image of the Dzungar past of the people of Altai-kizhi.\nChet and Chugul gathered thousands of Altaians for prayer meetings, initially in the Tereng Valley. These were violently suppressed by mobs of Russians, instigated by the Altaian Spiritual Mission, who were afraid of the potential of the competing religion to decrease the Orthodox Christian flock in Altai. Chet and Chugul were arrested, Chugul was released, and after a prolonged trial Chet was fully exonerated by court and released in 1906.\n\nResearcher Andrei A. Znamenski (see article below) compares the Burkanist movement to other indigenous revitalizing movements around the world, such as the Native American Ghost Dance or the Melanesian Cargo Cult. An excruciatingly detailed treatment of the comparisons and comparability of Burkhanism with the Melanesian Cargo Cult, the Mennonites, the Dukhobors of Georgia, the Mariitsy of Nizhnii Novgorod, and many other movements, is provided in Sherstova's dissertation from the 1980s.\n\nZnamenski says, the prime motivating factor was Altaians' fear of displacement by Russian colonists, Russification, and subjection to taxation and conscription on the same basis as Russian peasants.\n\nAndrei Vinogradov (thesis linked below) sees Burkhanism as a typical nomadic Turko-Mongolian mobilization pattern—aiming to link families and clans (\"seok\") into a steppe empire (which in this case never materialized). The Burkhanists' veneration of heroes from oral epics, he says, serves much the same cultural centralizing function as the veneration of other divine heroes such as Gesar, Manas, or Genghis Khan. As such it constitutes a major aspect of Turko-Mongolic religion, distinct from shamanism.\n\nAfter the arrest of Chet and Chugul, Tyryi Akemchi arose to become the most prominent \"iarlikchi\", and helped organize the movement. Having been exposed to Buddhism through his years as a translator in Mongolia, Tyryi added a number of Buddhist trappings to Burkhanist ritual, such as bells. Within a decade, most of the Altaian population had joined the new faith.\n\nIn 1918 Gregorii Choros-Gurkin and other Altaian leaders declared the formation of something called the \"Karakorum Regional Committee\" (\"Karakorumkaia Okruzhnaia Uprava\"), with the object of establishing an \"Oirat Republic\". This was intended to include not only Altai but also neighboring republics of Tuva and Khakassia. It was forcibly dissolved with arrival of Bolshevik power in 1921.\n\nBurkhanism accepts the \"three worlds\" of Mongolic and Turkic tradition. (These are the upper, middle, and lower worlds—in other words heaven, earth, and the underworld.) However, it rejects worship of traditional deities associated with the underworld. In addition, it imports into worship many figures from Altaian oral epic lore, which were not worshipped in the \"shamanic\" part of the Altaian religion.\n\nUch Kurbustan--\"Uch\" means \"three,\" while \"Kurbustan\" comes from the Soghdian \"Khormazta\" (and thence from the Avestan \"Ahura Mazda\"). Thus, a triune God. Though imported from oral epics, Uch Kurbustan is a generalized spirit rather than a hero of stories with a personality. He may be analogous with the Turko-Mongolian High God \"Tengri\" (\"Heaven\").\n\nRather than an import from Buddhism, Christianity, or Turkic Islam, this particular trinity is likely to have been inspired by other triune gods and heroes from Turkic culture (sometimes in the form of a god with three sons). Uch Kurbustan is connected with the following three messianic heroes, also from Altaian oral epic lore:\n\nThe gods of the upper world, or \"aru tos\" (\"pure ancestors\"), are considered fragments or eminations of Uch Kurbustan. Burkhanism calls these Burkhans. Among them are:\n\nGods of the \"middle world\"—i.e. the familiar spheres of nature and human affairs—include numerous local spirits, such as spirits associated with mountains (\"taika-eezi\") or springs (\"arzhans\"), or \"masters of the game\". They may also be associated with particular clans (\"seok\"). More generalized ones include:\n\nHistorically, Burkhanism rejected the traditional gods of the underworld, notably Erlik (Yerlik), its chief. This rejection is closely related to Burkhanism's rejection of Altaian shamanism, and corresponding elevation of oral epic singers (\"yarlikchi\"). (By \"shaman\" is here meant \"manjaktu kam\"s, i.e. the \"costume-wearing\" specialists who communicate with the underworld gods.) Both rejections are likely to have been inspired by oral epic lore, which regularly features shamans as villains.\n\n\nSome sources speak of a list of \"Twenty Commandments\" for Burkhanism. The evidence for this is sparse. Alcohol and tobacco were proscribed in the early years.\n\nChugul came to be venerated as the main recipient of the original message. This was much less true of Chet, although both were addressed with honorific titles.\n\n\nRussian painter Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena Roerich passed through Altai in 1926. Nicholas painted \"Oirat—Messenger of the White Burkhan\" based on his understanding of the movement.\n\n(Note that the painting's title apparently gets the theology backward—it was rather White Burkhan who was the messenger for Oirat.) Followers of Agni Yoga, an esoteric movement founded by the Roerichs, have encouraged a recent revival of interest in Burkhanism among non-Altaians. At the same time they have insisted on a link with Tibetan Buddhism and a veneration of Mount Belukha, elements not found in traditional Burkhanism.\n\nA number of Burkhanist revival organizations emerged during the 1990s, mostly as attempts to formulate or preserve an Altaian ethno-nationalist identity.

Its primary ingredients are red phosphorus and strong oxidizer, such as potassium chlorate and potassium perchlorate. Sulfur is used to substitute for some or all of the phosphorus to slightly decrease sensitivity and lower costs; calcium carbonate may also be present in small proportions. Commercially, Armstrong's mixture is used in milligram quantities on the paper caps in toy cap guns and in party poppers. An improvised version can be made with match-heads, ground up into a fine powder, and mixed with another fine powder, this time made of the striker strip found on the side of match boxes.\n\nIt has also been considered a suitable mixture for the primer used in guns after boron carbide has been added, and was used during the Second World War.\n\nBecause of its sensitivity to shock, friction and flame, Armstrong's mixture is an extremely dangerous explosive. Only about 10 mg of it is used per item of consumer fireworks. Depending on composition, conditions and quantity, Armstrong's mixture can explode violently in an enclosed space. Due to extreme sensitivity to friction, mixing dry potassium chlorate and red phosphorus will most likely lead to an explosion, hence the ingredients are usually combined in a slurry with water, formed into the final product (for example, single drops onto paper for \"paper caps\") and allowed to dry. To decrease sensitivity, oil can be added.\n\nArmstrong mixture is easy to make, but it requires too much phosphorus and it is easily oxidized by oxygen from air so it has little worth in military applications, except as homemade gun primer, or improvised explosives.\n"}

He is noted for his work on African civilizations prior to encounters with Europeans; his major work is \"The Destruction of Black Civilization\" (1971/1974). Williams remains a key figure in the Afrocentrist discourse. He asserts the validity of the long-discredited Black Egyptian hypothesis and that Ancient Egypt was predominantly a black civilization.\n\nWilliams was born on December 22, 1893, in Bennettsville, South Carolina, as the last of five children. His father had been born into slavery and had grown up to gain freedom and voting after the American Civil War. His mother Dorothy Ann Williams worked as a cook, nurse, and evangelist. The family suffered after Democrats regained power in the state legislature in the late 19th century and passed bills disfranchising blacks, as well as imposing racial segregation and white supremacy under Jim Crow. Williams' innate curiosity about racial inequality and cultural struggles, particularly those of African Americans, began as early as his fifth-grade year. Encouraged by a sixth-grade teacher, he sold \"The Crisis,\" published by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); and \"The Norfolk Journal and Guide\", as well as reading them and using their recommended books to direct his studies.\n\nYears later, he was quoted in an interview as saying:\n\nI was very sensitive about the position of black people in the town... I wanted to know how you explain this great difference. How is it that we were in such low circumstances as compared to the whites? And when they answered 'slavery' as the explanation, then I wanted to know where we came from.\n\nAs part of the Great Migration out of the rural South, the Williams family moved to Washington, DC in 1910. His father hoped for more opportunity there, especially in education, and Williams graduated from Armstrong Technical High School. Williams' mother died in 1925, leaving his father a widower. All their children were grown by then.\n\nAfter working for a while, Williams entered college at Howard University, a historically black college. He earned an undergraduate degree in Education in 1930, followed by a Master's in History in 1935. After completing a doctoral dissertation on the socioeconomic significance of the storefront church movement in the United States since 1920, he was awarded a Ph.D. in sociology by American University in 1949.\n\nWilliams began his studies abroad in England as a visiting professor to the universities of Oxford and London in 1953 and 1954. In 1956, he did field research in African history at Ghana's University College. At that time, his focus was on African achievements and the many self-ruling civilizations which had arisen and operated on the continent long before the coming of Europeans or East Asians. His last study, completed in 1964, covered 26 countries and more than 100 language groupings.\n\nIn 1935 Williams started as Administrative Principal for the Cheltenham School for Boys in Maryland. Four years later he became a teacher in the Washington, DC public schools. With World War II imminent, he entered the civil service system in the Federal government in 1941, serving as section chief of the Census Bureau, a statistician for War Relocation Board, and an economist in Office of Price Administration.\n\nIn 1946 he returned to his \"alma mater\" Howard University as a social science instructor, teaching until 1952. He transferred to the history department. By the 1960s, he was lecturing and writing about African history from a position of Afrocentrism. He concentrated on African civilizations before the European encounter, and was one of a group of scholars who asserted that Egypt had been a black civilization. He was a scholar at Howard until his retirement in 1966. Afterward he continued his studies and writing.\n\nIn 1971/1974, Williams published his major work, \"The Destruction of Black Civilization: Great Issues of a Race Between 4500 B.C. and 2000 A.D.\", placing it with a white publisher. The following year, the book received an award from the Black Academy of Arts and Letters (BAAL), founded in New York in 1969.\n\nWilliams worked for years to expand and revise the book before publishing a second edition. He had it published by Chicago's noted Third World Press, a black-owned firm. When published in 1987, the second edition of the book received wide critical acclaim from the African-American community.\n\nSince that period, there has been a re-evaluation of his emphasis on Afrocentrism, with some reviewers believing that it weakened his work's value as an historical source. In 1979, the Twenty-first Century Foundation, based in New York, honored Chancellor Williams with its first Clarence L. Holte International Biennial Prize.\n\nWilliams died of respiratory failure on December 7, 1992, aged 98, at Providence Hospital in Washington, D.C.. He had been a resident of the Washington Center for Aging Services for several years. He was survived by his wife of 65 years, Mattie Williams of Washington, and 14 children; 36 grandchildren; 38 great-grandchildren; and 10 great-great-grandchildren.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794094", "title": "Scottish highland dance", "text": "Scottish highland dance\n\nHighland dance or Highland dancing () is a style of competitive dancing developed in the Scottish Highlands in the 19th and 20th centuries, in the context of competitions at public events such as the Highland games. It was created from the Gaelic folk dance repertoire, but formalised with the conventions of ballet', and has been subject to influences from outside the Highlands. Highland dancing is often performed with the accompaniment of Highland bagpipe music, and dancers wear specialised shoes called ghillies. It is now seen at nearly every modern-day Highland games event.\n\nHighland dance should not be confused with Scottish country dance, cèilidh dancing, or clog dancing, although they may be demonstrated at presentations and present at social events.\n\nHighland dancing is a competitive and technical dance form requiring technique, stamina, and strength, and is recognised as a sport by the Sport Council of Scotland.\n\nIn Highland dancing, the dancers dance on the balls of the feet. Highland dancing is a form of solo step dancing, from which it evolved, but while some forms of step dancing are purely percussive in nature, Highland dancing involves not only a combination of steps but also some integral upper body, arm, and hand movements.\n\nHighland dancing should not be confused with Scottish country dancing which is both a social dance (that is, a dance which is danced with a partner or partners) like ballroom dancing, and a formation dance (that is, a dance in which an important element is the pattern of group movement about the dance floor) like square dancing.\n\nSome Highland dances do derive from traditional social dances. An example is the Highland Reel, also known as the Foursome Reel, in which groups of four dancers alternate between solo steps facing one another and a figure-of-eight style with intertwining progressive movement. Even so, in competitions, the Highland Reel dancers are judged individually. Most Highland dances are danced solo.\n\nMany non-practitioners think the two Celtic forms are synonymous. While some dance studios teach both, they are two distinct styles, not just in the attire. In comparison to Scottish highland dance, Irish dancers rarely use their arms which are held beside their bodies (rather than raised above the shoulders), legs and feet are frequently crossed (not turned out at 45°), and frequent use of the hard-soled step shoes (compared to ghillies or 'pumps'). There is a greater use of choreography than traditional movements.\n\nModern Highland dancing emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was 'created from the Gaelic folk dance repertoire, but formalised with the conventions of ballet'.\n\nIt seems that forms of sword dancing were performed by warriors in many parts of Europe in the prehistoric period. Forms of sword dancing are also attested in the late Medieval period. Ritualistic and combative dances that imitated epic deeds and martial skills were a familiar feature in Scottish tradition and folklore. The earliest reference to these dances in Scotland is mentioned in the \"Scotichronicon\" which was compiled in Scotland by Walter Bower in the 1440s. The passage regards Alexander III and his second marriage to the French noblewoman Yolande de Dreux at Jedburgh on 14 October 1285. \n\nIn 1573 Scottish mercenaries are said to have performed a Scottish sword dance before the Swedish King, John III, at a banquet held in Stockholm Castle. The dance, 'a natural feature of the festivities', was used as part of a plot to assassinate the King, where the conspirators were able to bare their weapons without arising suspicion. Fortunately for the King, at the decisive moment the agreed signal was never given.\n\n'Sword dance and Highland Dances' were included at a reception for Anne of Denmark at Edinburgh in 1589, and a mixture of sword dance and acrobatics was performed before James VI in 1617 (New Statistical Account of Scotland Edinb. 1845 x, pp. 44–45) and again for Charles I in 1633, by the Incorporation of Skinners and Glovers of Perth, \nThe British central government's policy of cultural suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the \"Act of Proscription\", which forbade the wearing of kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 and in the early 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or such as it was imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games as we now know them. Highland dancing was an integral part of the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.\n\nMost dancing prior to the 1900s was not organised at a national or international level. Judges of competitions were local persons, without specific standards for attire or the steps to the danced. Local Caledonian societies trained young dancers in the way of each society. Slowly consistency of steps was achieved, and dancing-specific organisations were established.\n\nDancers now undergo written examinations and practical assessments to become a teacher, and then further training and testing to become a dancer examiner, then competition judge or adjudicator.\n\nMany if not most Highland gatherings worldwide recognise the Royal Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing (RSOBHD), formed in 1950, as the world governing body of Highland dancing. The 'Royal' title from the Queen of the United Kingdom was approved by 16 November 2019. The RSOBHD standardised dance steps for competition purposes, established rules for competitions and attire, and certifies competitions and instructors. The RSOBHD World Highland Dance Championship has been held annually at the Cowal Highland Gathering since 1934. Today this RSOBHD World Championship is sanctioned by the RSOBHD at three levels: Juvenile, Junior and Adult. Only SOBHD-registered dancers may compete at this RSOBHD championship.\n\nThe RSOBHD is made up of representatives from many different Highland Dancing bodies and associations from around the world. The Board comprises delegates from the examining bodies (professional teaching associations), affiliated organisations in Australia (Australian Board of Highland Dancing Inc.), Canada (ScotDance Canada), South Africa (Official Board of Highland Dancing (South Africa)), New Zealand (Scot Dance New Zealand), and the United States (Federation of United States Teachers and Adjudicators) which represent the many Highland dance organisations in those countries.\n\nThe RSOBHD board sanctions Highland dancing championships although does not actually organise any of them. There are non-RSOBHD sanctioned championships run by non-RSOBHD aligned organisations at which registered RSOBHD dancers are forbidden to take part by the RSOBHD. At competitions and championships run by non-RSOBHD organisations, all dancers are welcome, however if they choose to participate they may receive a ban from the RSOBHD. Similarly, dancers not registered with the RSOBHD are forbidden to dance at RSOBHD sanctioned competitions by the RSOBHD. Each year the RSOBHD selects the championship steps to be performed by dancers at championships around the world. An official RSOBHD Highland Dance technique book for dancers and teachers has been published.\n\nOther organisations that qualify Highland dancers, teachers, and judges and hold competitions include: \n\nSuch organisations provide a wide syllabus of Highland and national dances and steps within their teaching.\n\nAt Highland games, the Highland dances were at first danced only by men. Women would take part in social dances, and girls did learn solo dances as part of their general dance classes. In fact, dancing masters would often encourage their most promising students (male or female) to perform solo dances at their end-of-term 'assemblies'.\n\nIn the late 19th century a young woman named Jenny Douglas (the name of Lorna Mitchell is also suggested) decided to enter a Highland dance competition. As this was not expressly forbidden, she was allowed to enter. Since then the number of females participating in the sport has increased until today in excess of 95% of all dancers are female. There have been several female World Champions crowned at the Cowal Highland Gathering since they began organising the competition in 1948. The first American to win the Adult World Championship was Hugh Bigney, who won the title in 1973. Indeed, the first three Adult World Championships were won by ladies: Nancy Cotter of New Zealand (1948), Margaret Samson (1949 and 1950). This feminisation of folk arts is a common pattern in the process of their 'gentrification', especially after they no longer serve a functional role in a male-centred, warrior culture. Males are still well represented at the world championships.\n\nHighland dancing competitions may be held solely or as part of larger events. The small annual Scottish Glen Isla competition is almost inconspicuous on the roadside, and is beside piping events and some heavy game events. Canada's Glengarry Highland Games on the other hand is one of the largest dancing and piping events on the North American calendar. Many of Australia's competitions are held indoors as a solo activity, while Canadian and Scottish competitions are associated with Highland games with a nearby hall available in case of inclement weather.\n\nAs far as competitions were concerned, until the early 20th century the usual dances seen were the Sword Dance, the Seann Triubhas, the Strathspey and Highland Reel, the Reel of Tulloch, and the Highland Fling. Since then, various other (pre-existing) dances have been added to the competition repertoire. For example, two character dances, 'The sailor's hornpipe' and 'The Irish jig' gained popularity in music hall and vaudeville productions.\n\nMost judges today evaluate a dancer on three major criteria: timing, technique and interpretation/overall deportment.\n\n\nThe various governing bodies of Highland dancing establish parameters for the dances themselves and scoring systems to grade the dancers and determine their class and progress from one class to another. The scoring system for these competitions begins with each dancer starting with 100 points. For any mistakes, poor execution, etc., results in subtraction of points at the judges discretion. The dancers are then ranked from most to fewest points, and medals and points are given based on the number of dancers in the class.\n\nThe notion of how dances were to be executed changed dramatically over the years. For instance, doing an early-20th-century-style sword dance in a competition today would get a dancer disqualified nearly immediately. There used to be terrible confusion as to what would be allowed (or prescribed) where, until the RSOBHD came up with a standard that has become acceptable to the majority of competitive dancers.\n\nScottish highland dances are generally divided into several types. Categories are more for convenience than strict style:\n\n\nStep dancing and clog dancing also used to regularly be part of some competitions.\n\nSteps of each dance are now laid out in national and international syllabus such as the text books of the RSOBHD, United Kingdom Alliance Ltd (UKA), and British Association of Teachers of Dancing (BATD). Each dance comprises a number of steps, which may be numbered or worded. A RSOBHD four-step Highland fling may have the 1st step, 7th, 5th alternative, and finish with the 8th step; or, Shedding, Double shake and rock, Second back-stepping, and Last shedding.\n\nThe Highlander developed 'as a necessary preparation for the management of the broad-sword... used in certain dances to exhibit their dexterity'; this included dancing over two naked swords which are laid across each other on the floor, some while a dancer moves nimbly around them. Dextrously placing the feet by a peculiar step in the intervals between crossed blades, as in the Ghillie Callum, has long been linked with dances before a decisive battle or as a victory dance. Legend has it that on the eve of battle the highland chief would call out the clan's best dancers, who would dance the sword dance. If the dancers successfully avoided touching either blade, then it was considered an omen that the next day's battle would be in the clan's favour. A more practical explanation behind the meaning of this dance can be found in the training halls of older styles of fencing, where students of the sword developed their footwork by following geometric patterns of crosses, squares and triangles marked out on the floor.\n\nIn another version of Scottish sword dancing, the Highlander danced on a targe shield, this has similarities with an ancient Roman exercise in which the man standing on a shield had to defend himself and stay upright while others tried to pull it out from under him. Many of the Highland dances now lost to us were once performed with traditional weapons that included the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, targe and dirk and the flail, the old Skye dancing song, 'Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann' (I will strike your head) indicate some form of weapon play to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, 'for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop'.\n\nThe Highland Dirk Dance, in which the dancer flourishes the weapon, is often linked to the sword dance or dances called 'Mac an Fhorsair', (literally, 'the son of the Forester'), the 'Broad Sword Exercise' or the 'Bruicheath' (battle dance). They are mentioned in a number of sources, usually military, and may have been performed in a variety of different forms, practiced by two performers in a duelling form, or as a solo routine.\n\nThe tune of Gille Chaluim (anglicised as 'Gillie Callum' and meaning 'the servant of Calum' in Gaelic) has been claimed to date back to Malcolm III of Scotland (1031–1093) but this claim is certain to have been fabricated to provide false credentials for the antiquity of the dance which is unlikely to have been invented before 1800. According to one tradition, the crossed swords were supposedly placed on the ground before a battle while a soldier danced around the blades. If his feet knocked against the swords, he would be wounded in battle. This may derive from the folklore often surrounding warrior culture, but the style of the dance was changed by the Maclennan brothers of Fairburn.\n\nOne theory about the Highland Fling is that it was a dance of triumph at the end of a battle. Another (no less romantic) theory is that it was performed before battles (like the sword dance), on top of the dancer's shield. The shield would have a spike in the middle, around which the dancer would do the dance that involves flicking of the feet, jumping and careful stepping supposedly to drive evil spirits away. The dancer is confined to one spot and snaps his fingers (which was reduced in recent times to merely holding the hands with the thumb touching the second joint of the middle finger, and the other three fingers extended in the air). Leaving aside the obvious difficulty of dancing around a sharpened spike on a shield, a much more plausible theory is that the Highland Fling is none other than a Foursome Reel with the progressive bits left out - at social gatherings, dancers would 'compete' by showing off the fancy solo steps they could perform, long before formal competitions at highland games had been invented.\n\nAnother story surrounding the Fling claims that it is meant to imitate a stag; the story goes that a boy who saw a stag was asked to describe it by his father. He lacked the words, so danced instead; the position of the hands resembles the head and antlers of a stag. This urban legend hides the fact that Highlanders used to snap their fingers as they danced.\n\nRuidhle Thulaichean (anglicised as 'The Reel of Tulloch') is supposed to have originated in the churchyard of Tullich, Aberdeenshire, where the congregation awaited the late minister. During the delay they whistled a highland tune and began to improvise a dance. A more gruesome version of the story is that the dance derives from a rough game of football that the inhabitants of Tulloch played with the severed head of an enemy; the Gaelic words to the tune bear this out.\n\nThe Seann Triubhas means 'old trousers' in Gaelic and is romantically associated with the repeal of the proscription of the kilt by the government after the failed Jacobite Uprising of 1745. However, the dance is considerably younger, with most of the steps performed today dating from the late 19th century.\n\nLike other dance traditions, what is called 'Highland dancing' is a hybrid form that has been constantly changing according to contemporary aesthetics and interpretations of the past. While some elements may be centuries old, other elements are much more modern. The vast majority of dances now performed were composed in the 20th century.\n\nHighland dances are now supplemented at Highland Games and dance competitions by what are known as National dances. In Highland dancing, every dancer wears a kilt, or tartan trews. Male dancers wear jackets, ties, and 'bonnets' (hats). Female dancers wear blouses with vests or jackets.\n\nAt Highland games, the National dances include the Scottish Lilt, the Earl of Erroll, Blue Bonnets, Hielan' Laddie, the Scotch Measure, Flora MacDonald's Fancy, Village Maid and Barracks Johnny, which illustrate the history of dancing and other aspects of Scottish culture and history. Some of the National dances were taught by dancing masters in the 19th century and show a balletic influence, while others derive from earlier traditions and were adapted to later tastes. The 'Earl of Erroll', for example, is based on an 18th-century percussive hard shoe footwork, although today's Highland dancers perform it in soft Ghillies. Some of the National dances were preserved and taught by dance masters such as D.G. MacLennan and Flora Buchan, while some were interpreted and reconstructed in the mid-20th century from notes written in Frederick Hill's 1841 manuscript.\n\nFor National dances, female dancers may wear an 'aboyne' (after the Aboyne Highland Games, where women are not allowed to wear kilts for dancing to this day, and so an outfit was devised as an alternative).\n\nThe sailor's hornpipe was adapted from an English dance, and is now performed more frequently in Scotland, while the Irish Jig is a humorous caricature of, and tribute to, Irish step dancing (the dancer, in a red and green costume, is an interpretation of an Irish person, gesturing angrily and frowning). If the Irish jig is danced by a woman or girl, it is about either the distressed wife scolding her husband, a woman being tormented by leprechauns, or a washerwoman chasing taunting boys (or children in general) away who have dirtied her washing - the showing of the woman's fist symbolises her wanting to beat up the children, the leprechauns, or the husband. If it is danced by a man or boy, it is the story of Paddy's leather breeches, in which a careless washerwoman has shrunk Paddy's fine leather breeches and he is waving his shillelagh at her in anger and showing his fist, intending to hit her.\n\nThe Hornpipe mimics a sailor in her majesty's navy doing work aboard ship: hauling rope, sliding on the rollicking deck, and getting his paycheck, and has quite a lot of detail involved that portrays the character (e.g. the dancer does not touch his palms, assumed to be dirty, on his uniform). Performed in a British sailor's uniform, its name derives from the accompanying instrument, the hornpipe. It is performed to tunes such as \"Crossing the Minch\" (Pipe Major Donald MacLeod) \"Jackie Tar\" (Traditional), and many other both contemporary and traditional tunes.\n\nPerhaps one of the most unusual elements of character dance in modern Highland dance competitions is the inclusion of the Cakewalk. The cakewalk is originally a dance performed by black slaves in the southern US imitating, in exaggerated style, the stately courtship ballroom dancing of slave owners. It is unique in competitive Highland Dance as it is the only dance always performed as a duo and is the only dance that originated outside the British Isles. Also unique is the inclusion of fanciful and often outrageous costumes upon which some of the judging of artistry is based. While costume contests do occasionally take place regarding the outfits worn for the other dances, the outfits for those dances are so carefully prescribed (differences are restricted primarily to choice of tartan, colour of jackets or sashes, and choices such as lace sleeves and velvet vests instead of velvet jackets) that costume does not play a significant role in the dance competition or vary much across dancers. In contrast, while the cakewalk may be danced in traditional Scottish attire, dancers involved in the cakewalk often attempt to come up with the most creative duo costume they can, such as Frankenstein and his bride, or Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The cakewalk is generally only danced at very large scale competitions such as national or provincial championships and is generally restricted to the top level of competitive dancers known as 'premier' (formerly 'open'.) The Cakewalk is generally performed to 'Whistling Rufus', written in 1899 by Kerry Mills. The inclusion of the Cakewalk in competitive Highland Dance is credited to dancer, judge and examiner James L. McKenzie who introduced the dance to Scotland from the United States.\n\nThe 'Hebridean dances' originated in the Hebrides and are now danced by Highland dancers. It is unknown when these dances originated, or who created them, but 19th century dance master Ewen MacLachlan taught them in the Western Isles during the mid-1800s.\n\nThey are Aberdonian Lassie, Blue Bonnets, Over the Water to Charlie, Tulloch Gorm, Flowers of Edinburgh, Scotch Measure (Twa'Some) and First of August. Many other dances from the Hebrides have been partially or fully lost. More relaxed than the other dances, they have also been more influenced by step-dancing.\n\nThe following list is by no means exhaustive. Those marked with an asterisk ('*') are regularly observed at RSOBHD competitions.\n\nHighland dances\n\nNational and (soft-shoe) step dances\n\nCharacter dances\n\n\nEach dancing association (RSOBHD, SOHDA, VSU, etc.) sets the standard of dress. Items such as lipstick, earrings, face glitter, and the wearing of rings may be prohibited depending on the organisation.\n\nThe following is an indication of what is commonly observed. Attire has also changed over the decades. Ruffles around the neck and wrist-cuffs were once quite common. Long-sleeved kilt jackets give way to short-sleeved jackets depending on the climate. A dancer's skill level or sex may also determine the attire (under RSOBHD rules, Premier-level dancers have more prescribed items than pre-Premier dancers).\n\nMen wear traditional Scottish hat called a Balmoral and a doublet of coloured velvet or cloth. If the jacket is in the 'Prince Charlie' style then it is to be accompanied by a shirt and bow tie with a waistcoat, cummerbund or belt. Jackets in the 'Montrose' style are to be worn with a white lace jabot and, optionally, sleeve ruffles. A kilt and matching tartan hose are worn with a sporran, or tartan trews can be worn instead of a kilt for the Seann Truibhas.\n\nFemales wear a tartan kilt with a velvet jacket, worn with a lace insert, or a sleeveless velvet vest worn over a white blouse. The jacket or vest may be black or coloured with a gold or silver braid and buttons down the front. Matching tartan hose are also worn.\n\nMales wear the same dress for National dances as Highland dances, however tartan trews may be worn instead of a kilt.\n\nFemales may wear a white dress with a tartan plaid over the right shoulder. Alternatively they may wear the more popular 'aboyne'. The aboyne dress consists of a velvet bodice over a white blouse with a tartan or tartan-like knee-length skirt and white underskirts. A tartan 'plaid' or 'plaidie' is worn with a Scottish-themed brooch pinned to the shoulder and waist. They may also wear skin coloured tights or white socks.\n\nBoth sexes wear the same outfit for the sailor's hornpipe in either navy or white. A v-neck jumper is worn over a square-necked white vest with bell bottom trousers. A navy or light blue collar (with three stripes) and a sailor's regulation cap are also worn. There used to be horizontal creases in the trousers.\n\nIrish jig shoes are black, green or red and, though they closely resemble ghillies, are hard-soled shoes with heels.\n\nMales wear a Paddy hat, red or green muffler and tailcoat, brown or khaki breeches and a waistcoat in a contrasting colour to that of the tailcoat. A shillelagh, a kind of Irish cudgel, is carried for twirling.\n\nFemales may wear one of several combinations of red, green and white blouses, dresses, skirts and cummerbunds. Dancers also wear white underskirts and a white apron.\n\n\n\n"}

An enemy of Sherlock Holmes, he first appears in the 1903 short story \"The Adventure of the Empty House\". Holmes once described him as \"the second most dangerous man in London,\" the most dangerous being Professor Moriarty, Moran's employer.\n\nAccording to Sherlock Holmes's index of criminal biographies, Sebastian Moran was born in London in 1840, the son of Sir Augustus Moran, CB, sometime Minister to Persia.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford before embarking upon a military career. Formerly of the 1st Bangalore Pioneers (Madras), he served in the Jowaki Expedition of 1877–1878 and in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, seeing action at the Battle of Char Asiab, 6 October 1879 (for which he was mentioned in despatches); the Battle of Sherpur, 23 December 1879; and at Kabul.\n\nA devoted sportsman and highly skilled shot, he was author of the books \"Heavy Game of the Western Himalayas\" in 1881 and \"Three Months in the Jungle\" in 1884, and reportedly once \"crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger\". Although there was no open scandal after his turning to crime, he was obliged to retire from the army and return to London. Outwardly respectable, with an address in Conduit Street, Mayfair, and membership of the (fictional) Anglo-Indian Club, the Tankerville Club and The Bagatelle Card Club, he was nevertheless recruited by Professor Moriarty, and served as his chief of staff. Ultimately he is used solely for assassinations that required his peculiar skill with the rifle; Holmes mentions the killing of a Mrs. Stuart in 1887 which he suspects (but cannot prove) Moran was involved in. In \"The Final Problem\" (set in 1891), Moran escaped incrimination, and followed the Professor to Reichenbach Falls, where Moran attempted to kill Holmes by rolling boulders upon him.\n\nThereafter Moran earned a living in London by playing cards at several clubs. When one of the other players, Ronald Adair, noticed that Moran won by cheating and threatened to expose him, Moran murdered Adair with a silenced air rifle that fired revolver bullets. Dr. Watson and the returned Holmes having taken the case, Moran attempted to kill Holmes by firing the air rifle from a vacant house opposite the detective's residence. Holmes having anticipated this, Moran shot a wax effigy of the detective, while Holmes, Watson, and Inspector Lestrade all hid nearby to seize the would-be assassin.\n\nIn \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", Holmes mentions Moran as still alive (in September 1902). Moran is also mentioned in \"His Last Bow\" as an example of Holmes's many adversaries who have futilely sworn revenge against him.\n\nColonel Sebastian Moran was also the villain in Doyle's Sherlock Holmes play \"The Crown Diamond,\" written in the early 1900s but not performed until 1921. When this play was adapted as the short story \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\", Moran was replaced by 'Count Negretto Sylvius'.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since that group's dissolution in the late 1970s, Keenan has released a number of solo and collaborative recordings, and continues to tour both as a soloist, and with singer/guitarist Tommy O'Sullivan.\n\nPaddy Keenan was born in Trim, County Meath in 1950 to John Keenan (an Irish Traveller) and Mary Bravender Keenan (of settled descent). Though the Keenan family abandoned the Traveling lifestyle early in Paddy's life, he spent much of his youth contending with discrimination, including regular physical confrontations. His father and grandfather both played the pipes, and his father spent many nights playing along with piper Johnny Doran. When he was about six years old, Keenan was introduced to the tin whistle by his brother Johnny (a notable Irish banjo player), and began playing the pipes around age nine.\n\nRecognizing his son's interest, John Keenan tutored Paddy, along with neighbouring children, including Finbar Furey and Davy Spillane. During this period, the Keenan household was an ongoing session. At age fourteen, Keenan played his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, followed by a few years of touring with a number of musicians, including his father, as \"The Pavees.\" At seventeen, Keenan went to England in an attempt to escape the strictness of his father's household, and ended up busking around London, singing and playing blues and rock songs on guitar for most of the following four years. After nearly selling or throwing away his pipes several times, he discovered in 1971 that busking with them was far more lucrative than with the guitar, and resumed his piping career.\n\nReturning to Dublin, Keenan played regularly with his brothers and father at folk clubs and various venues around Ireland. In 1975, he was part of a band called 'Seachtar', from the Irish word for 'seven people.' This band was the genesis of The Bothy Band, of which Keenan was a mainstay from its inception to its demise in 1979.\n\nKeenan's first (and eponymous) solo album appeared in 1975, and he also duetted with fiddler Paddy Glackin on the 1978 album \"Doublin\". He subsequently recorded a second solo album for Gael-Linn Records, \"Poirt An Phiobaire\", in 1983.\n\nAfter rejecting the chance to join Moving Hearts in the early 1980s, Keenan's musical career went into abeyance. However, in the 1990s he relocated to North America, rediscovered his musical talents and in 1997 issued \"Na Keen Affair\", recorded at Dadyeen Studios, St. Johns, Newfoundland, Canada. Supporting musicians include Tommy Peoples and Patrick Moran on fiddle, Arty McGlynn and Tommy O'Sullivan on guitar, as well as Newfoundland musicians. This led to an ongoing musical relationship with the London-born, Kerry-based guitarist Tommy O'Sullivan. Together, the pair issued \"The Long Grazing Acre\" in 2001, touring jointly to promote the album. According to their respective websites, Keenan and O'Sullivan have continued to perform together periodically since 2001.\n\nThe 2008 documentary \"\" tells the story of his 3000-mile cross-cultural musical adventure with Liam Ó Maonlaí (Hothouse Flowers) and friends, and features performances from the Festival au Désert.\n\nUpon demonstrating and aptitude for, and interest in the pipes around the age of ten, John Keenan got Paddy a full set of pipes by John Clarks. Six years later, in 1966, Keenan's father bought him a full set made by the Crowley family, which (with the addition of a Leo Rowsome chanter), Paddy played until 2000. At that point, Keenan received a full set from maker Dave Williams of Grimsby, England, who died a few years later in a car accident.\nThis set, which was a copy of the previous Crowley set, remains Keenan's primary instrument.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Frankie Gavin and Junji Shirota ()\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794135", "title": "Jiuchi", "text": "Jiuchi\n\n, commonly referred to as \"ji,\" is the base beat or underlying rhythm in traditional Japanese music. In the folk tradition, it consists of a simple, even rhythm, sung using kuchi shoka as \"do ko do ko.\" This is often called \"straight ji\" in English to differentiate from other ji patterns.\n\nA common variation is to \"swing\" the ji, called the \"dongo\" pattern after the kuchi shoka (sung as \"don go don go\"). When playing dongo, the upbeat (the \"go\") is not evenly spaced between the downbeats, but is instead played toward the \"back of the beat,\" a common practice in jazz music. Generally the first note of each pair is twice as long as the second, giving the pattern a triplet feel. In English, the dongo pattern is often simply called the swing ji because of the history of the swing rhythm in North American jazz. Other common types of ji include the horse-beat ji (\"don dogo don dogo\"; in Western drum notation:\"1.&12.&a3.&a4.&a\") and the matsuri, or festival, ji (\"DON doko don DON, DON doko don DON\").\n\nThe ji is usually played throughout a song to hold the other instruments together rhythmically. For this reason, the ji is prevalent when playing taiko, which is a Japanese art form in which the drums are the central instrument. When playing taiko, the ji is often simple and loud, played most often on a smaller rope-tied drum (the \"shime-daiko\") which is high-pitched and has a sharp attack, making it easily audible over the rumble of the larger taikos. It can by played on almost any instrument, however. For example, it is commonly played on the largest drum (the \"ōdaiko\"), either as backing for the other instruments, or to aid a soloist playing on the other head of the drum.\n"}
{"id": "1794136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794136", "title": "Beachley", "text": "Beachley\n\nBeachley is a village in Gloucestershire, England, near the border with Monmouthshire. It is located on a peninsula at the confluence of the rivers Wye and Severn, where the Severn Bridge ends and the smaller secondary bridge for the River Wye begins, both bridges carrying the M48 motorway between England and Wales though the motorway is not directly accessible from the village. The tidal range on this stretch of water is the highest in the UK. Before the construction of the bridge it was a ferry port from where the Aust Ferry operated until 1966.The population in 2011 was 764.\n\nBefore the 9th century, the Beachley peninsula and the mouth of the Wye were part of the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. A small chapel was founded at what was then the southernmost point of the peninsula - now a tidal island known as Chapel Rock - traditionally in the 4th century by Tecla, a princess of Gwynedd who retired there as a hermit before being murdered by raiders from the sea. A chapel dedicated to St Twrog, perhaps containing a navigation light, was later built on the rock but was ruined before the 18th century. \n\nOffa's Dyke, built by the Mercians in the 8th century, cuts off the peninsula to the north. In 956, Beachley was part of lands granted by King Edwy to Bath Abbey. According to historians interpreting the writings of Walter Map, it is likely that Beachley was the site of an unprecedented meeting around 1056 between the unchallenged ruler of Wales, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, and the king of England, Edward the Confessor, to establish each one's areas of control.\n\nThe crossing of the Severn estuary between Beachley and Aust was probably in use from antiquity and was long the chief route between southern England and southern Wales. It was recorded in the 12th century when the de Clares, lords of Tidenham, granted quittance of the passage to the monks of Tintern, and was evidently much used in 1405 when great numbers of the English and Welsh were said to resort to the nearby chapel of St Twrog. The manor of Tidenham retained rights over the passage, and received rents from the parishes of Aust and Beachley, until the 19th century.\n\nBeachley was the site of fighting in the Civil War. It was garrisoned by Royalists under Sir John Wintour, but was overrun in October 1644 by Parliamentary forces under Col. Edward Massey.\n\nSt John's Church was built in 1833 by Bristol architects Foster and Okely. Its cost was borne largely by James Jenkins, the owner of Beachley Manor. In the 1850s the rector was Rev. G.W. Bridges, an early photographer.\n\nIn 1915, during World War I, the government requisitioned a large area of land at Beachley and constructed National Shipyard No.2. However, the war ended before production had begun. Instead, in 1924 it was decided to establish a British Army Apprentices School (which in 1966 was renamed as an Army Apprentices College) at Beachley to ensure a core of qualified soldiers with excellent technical education combined with first class military training as potential NCOs and officers mainly for the specialist corps Royal Engineers, REME Plant Operator mechanics and RAOC.\n\nThe AAC closed in 1994, and the army converted the site to an infantry barracks. After the recent reorganisation of the Army, \"Future Army Structures\" and \"Future Infantry Structures\" this is now the permanent home of the First Battalion The Rifles.\n\nThe old ferry slipway is now used by the Severn Area Rescue Association (SARA), whose Beachley lifeboat station is next to the slipway. SARA has been established for over 40 years and is considered to be the second largest UK lifeboat association (the largest being the RNLI). SARA currently operates six lifeboat rescue stations on the Severn between Newport and Kidderminster and is staffed entirely by volunteers. In addition to lifeboat duties, SARA also has cliff rescue, flood and land search capabilities. SARA is a member of Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MREW).\n\nThe Aust Severn Powerline Crossing runs over the river at Beachley to Aust. A tunnel also runs under the River Severn between Beachley and Aust carrying electric cables.\n\n\n\n"}

It has an area of approximately 114.2 km² and is in the southern foothills of the Yinshan mountains.\n\nAs of 2011, it had a population of roughly 377,100, including members of the Mongol, Hui, Manchu, Daur, Tibetan, Uyghur, Hmong, and Yi national minorities.\n\nAdministratively speaking, Ulanqab is a \"city\" and Jining a \"district\", in reality Jining is a \"de facto\" city, while Ulanqab is an administrative division covering a much larger area. See prefecture-level city for more information on this arrangement.\n\nJining South Railway Station () serves as a railway intersection to the border town of Erenhot to the north, Hohhot and Baotou to the west, and Shanxi province's Datong to the south.\n\nRecorded human activity in the Jining area dates back to the Shang Dynasty. It was originally named Bingzhou (). In the Song Dynasty it was part of the Yunzhong Commandery (); it was placed under the administration of Datong during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). During the Yuan Dynasty, it was named \"Jining\" for the first time. In 1675, the Jining area was placed under the administration of the Plain Yellow Banner of Chahar Province, and in 1750 was transferred to Fengzhen City's administration. In 1922, it was renamed Jining and became a municipality, and the following year a county. In 1948 Jining fell under the control of the Communist Party. The urban core was subsequently renamed Chengguan Town (roughly, \"urban district\"), then Pingdiquan Town (), then finally back to Jining in April 1956.\n\nIn 2004, Ulanqab League, to which it is the seat of government, was 'converted' to a prefecture-level city, and Jining is correspondingly changed from a county-level city to a district. Ulanqab is named Chaborte in the writings of P. Evariste Huc.\n\nJining is a major transport node in central Inner Mongolia. It is on the Beijing-Baotou railway, and the terminus of the Jining-Erenhot Railway, making the city a short connection away from urban centres such as Hohhot, Baotou, Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Beijing. High-speed rail access is available to Hohhot and Baotou; travel time to the regional capital is approximately an hour.\n\nJining is also on the route of China National Highway 208, China National Highway 110, and the G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway.\n\nIntercity buses are available to neighboring cities and towns.\n\nThe Jining area is a source of limestone and turquoise.\n"}

Written by Salomé, Danièle Thompson, and Jérôme Tonnerre, the film is about a mummy's spirit that possesses a woman (Sophie Marceau) in the Paris museum. Loosely based on the 1927 horror novel \"Belphégor\" by Arthur Bernède, this film is the third dramatized adaptation, following the first film in 1927, and a TV miniseries in 1965. \"Belphegor, Phantom of the Louvre\" was filmed on location at the Musée du Louvre, the first feature film to be shot in part inside the world-famous museum.\n\nA rare collection of artifacts from an archeological dig in Egypt are brought to the famous Musée du Louvre in Paris. While experts are using a laser scanning device to determine the age of a sarcophagus, a spirit escapes and makes its way into the museum's electrical system. Museum curator Faussier (Jean-Francois Balmer) brings in noted Egyptologist, Glenda Spencer (Julie Christie), to examine the findings, and she announces that the mummy inside the coffin was actually the evil spirit Belphegor.\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa (Sophie Marceau), a young woman who lives across the street from the museum, follows her runaway cat into the Louvre after closing time. She accidentally receives an electrical shock that transfers the stray spirit into her body. Soon Lisa is disguising herself as Belphegor and making off with the rare Egyptian treasures on display at the museum, convinced that they are rightfully hers. When Belphegor proves more than a match for the Louvre's security forces, renowned detective Verlac (Michel Serrault) is brought out of retirement to find out why the museum's Egyptian collection has been shrinking.\n\n\nCritical reception for \"Belphegor, Phantom of the Louvre\" has been mostly negative.\nJustin Felix from DVD Talk gave the film a mixed two and a half out of five stars, writing, \"\"Belphegor: Phantom of the Louvre\" is modestly entertaining, despite some very familiar plot elements and so-so CGI work.\" Chris Parry from \"eFilmCritic\" awarded the film two out of five stars, panning the film's acting, special efects, screenplay, and familiar premise. Steve Barton from Dread Central rated the film two and a half out of five stars, writing, \"For all that it has going for it in the acting department, \"Belphégor Phantom of the Louvre\" comes up on the short side of the fence nearly everywhere else. It’s a decent little time killer, but you’ll ultimately start forgetting about it even before the end credits run.\"\n\n"}

Born John Stevenson, he took his screen name from Steve Brodie, a daredevil who claimed to have jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge in 1886 and survived.\n\nBrodie appeared in 79 feature films during his career (1944-1988), plus a profusion of appearances on episodic TV. He worked at various studios, including MGM, RKO and Republic Pictures, appearing mostly in westerns and B-movies. He played supporting roles in the majority of his films, including the 1947 film noir classic \"Out of the Past\" and 1950's \"Armored Car Robbery\". \n\nAn exception was 1947's \"Desperate\", where he had a starring role. Later appearances included roles in two Elvis Presley films: 1961's \"Blue Hawaii\" and 1964's \"Roustabout\".\n\nBeginning in the mid 1950s, he appeared mostly on television, with guest-starring roles in such series as \"Stories of the Century\" (as the outlaw Harry Tracy), \"Crossroads\", \"Sugarfoot\", \"Colt .45\", \"Stagecoach West\", \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective\", \"The Public Defender\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"The Alaskans\", \"Pony Express\", \"The Brothers Brannagan\", \"Going My Way\", \"The Asphalt Jungle\", \"\", and \"The Dakotas\".

{"id": "1794197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794197", "title": "Olivetans", "text": "Olivetans\n\nThe Olivetans, or the Order of Our Lady of Mount Olivet, are a monastic order formally recognised in 1344. They have formed the Olivetan Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation since 1960.\n\nThe Order of Our Lady of Mount Olivet is a small Roman Catholic order, founded in 1313 by Bernardo Tolomei (born Giovanni Tolomei) along with two of his friends from the noble families of Siena, Patrizio Patrizi and Ambrogio Piccolomini. They initially lived as hermits in the \"savage waste of Accona\". The building of the monastery here began with the approbation of the foundation charter by Guido Tarlati, bishop of Arezzo (26 March 1319).\n\nThe name \"Olivetan\" comes from the name of the order's original hermitage, called Monte Oliveto in honour of Christ's Passion. The monastery later became known as \"Monte Oliveto Maggiore\" (\"greater\") to distinguish it from successive foundations at Florence, San Gimignano, Naples and elsewhere. It is still the mother house of the order or congregation. \n\nAfter the arrival of a number of new followers, the nascent community adopted the Rule of St. Benedict and was recognised by Pope Clement VI in 1344. In 1408 Gregory XII gave them the extinct monastery of St. Justina at Padua, which they occupied until the institution there of the Benedictine reform.\n\nUnlike many other Benedictine congregations, the Olivetans have a centralized structure, supervised by the abbot general at Monte Oliveto Maggiore. Olivetan Benedictines wear a white habit. \n\nThe Olivetan monks run Bec Abbey in France, which was left in ruins in 1792 by the French Revolution. In 1948 Olivetans from the Monastery of Our Lady of Holy Hope at Mesnil-Saint-Loup and the Monastery of the Virgin Mary at Cormeilles-en-Parisis re-established the monastery at Bec. \n\nIn 1955, Benedictine monks from St. Benedict's Abbey in Wisconsin took over the former Trappist monastery of Our Lady of Guadalupe Abbey in Pecos, New Mexico. In 1985, the monastery became part of the Olivetan congregation. The abbey offers retreats and spiritual direction.\n\nThe Monastery of Christ Our Saviour was founded in 1980 in the village of Turvey Abbey, Bedfordshire. Adjacent to the monastery is the Priory of Our Lady of Peace of Olivetan Benedictine nuns. The monastery and the priory share worship services. While the monks have no outside apostolate, guests are welcome. The priory is not open to the public, but the chapel is open and visitors are welcome.\n\nThe Congregation also maintain abbeys and prioral churches in Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil. In 1960 they formed the Olivetan Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation.\n\nOlivetan nuns are distinguished from the sisters in that the nuns focus primarily on the Divine Office according to the Rule of Saint Benedict, while the sisters engage in outside apostolates such as religious education or pastoral care, and therefore follow a modified form of the rule.\n\nIn 1874, Benedictine sisters from the Convent of Maria Rickenbach in the Canton of Unterwalden, Switzerland, arrived as teachers in Maryville, Missouri. Shortly thereafter some of the sisters were sent to Arkansas. In 1893 the Arkansas community affiliated with the Olivetans. In 1900, they opened St. Bernard's Hospital in Jonesboro.\n\nThe Prophecy of St. Malachy is a supposed list of 112 popes beginning in 1143 with Pope Celestine II and continuing apparently to the end of time. It was allegedly discovered around 1595 by Benedictine monk Arnold de Wyon, who attributes it to the 12th century Malachy of Armagh. Each pope is identified with a short cryptic motto. The next to last pope has the motto \"Gloria oliuæ\" (Glory of the olive).\n\nAfter the election of Joseph Ratzinger to the papacy in 2005, proponents of the prophecy connected him to the entry for the next to last pope: Ratzinger chose the name Benedict; one of the Benedictine congregations is the Olivetans, thus, \"Gloria oliuæ\".\n\nHowever, there is no particular connection between the Olivetan Order and Pope Benedict XVI. In 1139, Malachy visited Rome, stopping at Clairvaux Abbey both on the way and on his return. His contemporary, Bernard of Clairvaux wrote a \"vita\" of St. Malachy, providing many interesting anecdotes, but does not mention any prophecy. Reputable church historians since the 18th century have considered \"The Prophecy of St. Malachy\" a forgery, most likely written around 1590. Most scholars consider the document a 16th-century elaborate hoax, bearing similarities to a 1557 history of the popes by Onofrio Panvinio, including mistakes.\n\nThomas Groome, of Boston College said, \"...the 'Prophecies of St. Malachy' are a grand old fun tale that have about as much reliability as the morning horoscope\".\n\n\n"}

At the time of its opening in November 1998, it was the biggest shopping mall in Hong Kong. Festival Walk is acquired by Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (\"MNACT\"). There are also four floors of offices on top of the mall.\n\nFestival Walk is located in Yau Yat Chuen, Sham Shui Po District, and is directly linked to Kowloon Tong station, which is an interchange station of the East Rail Line and the Kwun Tong Line of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway. Festival Walk has a direct rail connection to Mainland China. It also has a pedestrian link to the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nConstruction of the mall commenced in 1994 and was completed in 1998. Significant challenges were faced in the creation of the 21,000 m² site due to its terraced land form as well as its narrow land shape. The tunnels for the Kwun Tong Line of the MTR run through the full length of the site. During the construction of the building's four basement levels, 460,000 m³ of earth had to be removed.\n\nFestival Walk was jointly owned by Swire Properties and CITIC Pacific until 2006, when Swire Properties bought out the 50% stake held by its partner. In July 2011, Mapletree Investments acquired the property for HK$18.8 billion (approximately US$2.4 billion), making it the world's largest retail real estate deal in 2011.\n\nIn 2015 it was announced that the AMC Cinema, a major anchor tenant, would move to Yuen Long due to a rent increase that the director of Broadway Circuit (operator of the AMC chain in Hong Kong) called \"very astonishing\". The AMC cineplex had been a tenant of Festival Walk for over 17 years. The cinema was replaced by an eight-screen Festival Grand Cinema in 2016.\n\nFestival Walk comprises some one million square feet of retail space. It has approximately 220 shops and restaurants, a multiplex cinema and an ice rink. Located above the mall is an additional of office space. Festival Walk's three level car park can accommodate 830 cars.\n\nFestival Walk is positioned as a \"comfortable\" middle-market mall with the emphasis on service rather than price. The relatively spacious stores are mid-range to high-end and include brands such as Agnes B flagship store, Calvin Klein Jeans, Hollister, H&M, Juicy Couture and Kate Spade New York. Like malls in many western countries, Festival Walk has information booths to assist shoppers.\n\nThe seven-storey shopping mall occupies three lower-ground levels, a ground level and three levels above ground. A six-level atrium, some 120 m long and 30 m wide atrium cuts longitudinally through the interior of the mall. A glass skylight over the atrium provides natural light to the interior of the building. There is a food court on the mall's topmost floor, with a view of the indoor skating rink.\n\nFestival Walk is equipped with a waste management system for all food service outlets within the mall. An organic food digester was installed to accelerate the decomposition of food waste into waste water and food residue which is then discharged harmlessly into the sewerage system. The developers also installed a water-cooled air-conditioning system in 2002 at a cost of HK$13 million. The developer claims the system's high energy efficiency has saved 5 million kWh each year.\n\nThe development was a 50:50 joint venture between Swire Properties and CITIC Pacific. The partners secured the plot in a Government land auction in 1993 with a HK$2.9 billion bid, and developed it at an estimated cost of $2.2 billion. In January 2006, in Hong Kong's biggest property deal, Swire Properties paid HK$6.18 billion to buy out its partner's half share. In July 2007, it was announced that Swire Pacific was contemplating listing the property as a real estate investment trust. In July 2011, Mapletree Investments acquired Festival Walk at a property value of HK$18.8 billion which was the largest global retail real estate deal in 2011 In 2013, Festival Walk was divested to Mapletree's fourth real estate investment trust, the Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust, as one of its two seed assets in 2013. In 2018, Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust renamed as Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust upon completion of acquisition of Japan portfolio. The mall is now managed by Mapletree North Asia Property Management Limited.\n\nAt approximately 9:00 pm (0800 GMT) on 30 March 2014 hailstones the size of golfballs shattered the ceiling windows of Festival Walk during a heavy thunderstorm, causing rain to pour straight into the interior of the mall. Some sections of interior ceiling collapsed and ankle-deep flooding was reported. Water from the shopping mall overflowed into the attached railway station. Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust Management, the manager of Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust, which owns Festival Walk, said its staff were on site to render assistance. However, mall management were criticized for failing to alert the public through the mall's website and via relevant social media networks. Evacuation of the public was also done poorly, as at 10:00 pm the public was still on scene sending live images to social media networks.\n\n"}

He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team and professionally for the Chicago Bulls in the NBA. He is married to Nikki Bonacorsi and is the father of one daughter, Amelia.\n\nThen known as Jason Williams, he won the 2001 NCAA Championship with Duke, and was named NABC Player of the Year in 2001 and 2002. He was drafted second overall in the 2002 NBA Draft by the Bulls. He asked to be called Jay on joining the Bulls, to avoid confusion with two other players in the NBA at the time. His playing career was effectively ended by a motorcycle accident in 2003. He last signed with the Austin Toros of the NBA Development League, but was waived on December 30, 2006 due to lingering physical effects from his accident.\n\nSince retiring, he has worked as an analyst for ESPN, initially working on \"ESPN College Basketball\". In 2019, however, Williams was reassigned to the NBA full-time with his addition on ESPN's \"NBA Countdown\" program.\n\nWilliams grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey, and attended St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, graduating in 1999. He not only excelled at basketball, but took an active interest in other activities, most notably chess. His nickname in high school was \"Jay Dubs.\" Williams also played junior varsity soccer during his freshman year and was the state volleyball player of the year during his senior year. In basketball that year, Williams was named a First Team All-State Player in New Jersey, the New Jersey Player of the Year, a \"Parade\" All-American, a \"USA Today\" first team All-American, and a McDonald's All-American, where he competed in the Slam Dunk Contest and the McDonald's All-American Game, scoring 20 points in the contest. In his last year of high school he averaged 19 points, 7.0 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 3.7 steals per game; he had started each of the 4 years he spent at St. Joseph, and set school records in total points (1,977) and steals (407). He was also named the recipient of the 1999 Morgan Wootten Award for his basketball achievements and his work in the classroom, where he maintained a 3.6 GPA.\n\nAt Duke, Williams, a , point guard, became one of the few freshmen in school history to average double figures in scoring and was named ACC Rookie of the Year and National Freshman of the Year by The Sporting News, averaging 14.5 points, 6.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds per contest. He was also a first team Freshman All-American by \"Basketball Times\".\n\nThe next season Williams started all 39 games and led the Devils to the 2001 NCAA National Championship, earning NABC Player of the Year honors. His 841 points broke Dick Groat's 49-year Duke record for points in a season, while he led all tournament scorers with a 25.7 ppg average. Williams also set the NCAA Tournament record for three-pointers attempted (66), while also making 132 three-point field goals—good for the sixth-highest total in NCAA history. His 21.6 ppg led the ACC and made him the first Duke player since Danny Ferry (1989) to lead the league in scoring. His 6.1 assists were good for second in the league, while he also ranked second in three-point field goal percentage (.427) and first in three-pointers made (3.4 per game). Williams was widely considered the best player in college basketball, earning both the prestigious Naismith Award and Wooden Award as College Basketball's Player of the Year in 2002. He graduated with a degree in Sociology in 2002, and left Duke with 2,079 points, good for sixth all-time, and with his jersey number 22 retired at Senior Day.\n\nHe had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season (tied for 5th-most in Duke history as of March 28, 2010, with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and J.J. Redick).\n\nIn 2001–02, Williams, Carlos Boozer, and Mike Dunleavy Jr. each scored at least 600 points for the season, a feat only matched at Duke by Jon Scheyer, Kyle Singler, and Nolan Smith in the 2009–10 season. Williams (841) and Shane Battier (778) on the 2001 national championship team were one of only two Duke duos to each score over 700 points in a season, the other duo being Scheyer (728) and Singler (707) in the 2009–10 season.\n\nWilliams was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the second overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft, after Yao Ming was selected by the Houston Rockets.\n\nHe played for the US national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.\n\nWilliams was a starter in the Bulls' line-up for most of the 2002–03 NBA season. Although his performance was inconsistent and he competed for playing time with Jamal Crawford, he showed signs of promise including posting a triple-double in a win over his home state team, the New Jersey Nets.\n\nOn the night of June 19, 2003, Williams crashed his Yamaha YZF-R6 motorcycle into a streetlight at the intersection of Belmont and Honore streets in Chicago's Roscoe Village neighborhood. Williams was not wearing a helmet, was not licensed to ride a motorcycle in Illinois, and was also violating the terms of his Bulls contract by riding a motorcycle. Williams' injuries included a severed main nerve in his leg, fractured pelvis and three torn ligaments in his left knee including the ACL. He required physical therapy to regain the use of his leg. A week after the motorcycle crash the Bulls drafted point guard Kirk Hinrich. When it became clear Williams would not be returning to the Bulls for a long time, if at all, because of his injuries, he was waived. Legally, the Bulls did not have to pay him any salary, because his injuries occurred while he was violating his contract by riding a motorcycle. Instead, the Bulls gave Williams $3 million when they waived him, which Williams could use toward future rehabilitation expenses. Williams stated at the time that he would continue to train and intended to make a return to the Bulls, but in his 2016 memoir, he mentioned that a lot of the Bulls' severance package fueled his addiction to illegal painkillers. In the interim, he appeared in college and high school basketball broadcasts on ESPN as a commentator.\n\nOn September 28, 2006, the New Jersey Nets announced that they had signed Williams to a non-guaranteed contract, giving Williams the opportunity to play in his home state. However, on October 22, the Nets released Williams.\n\nHe then signed with the Austin Toros of the NBA Development League, but on December 30, 2006, the Toros waived him due to injury. Williams subsequently announced that he had no plans to resume his basketball career.\n\nWilliams works for ESPN as an NBA analyst. Previously, Williams covered college basketball for the network. He has also done motivational speaking and worked as an analyst on CBS College Sports Network during the 2008 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. He was a recruiter for sports agency Ceruzzi Sports and Entertainment from 2007–09. In 2016, Williams released his autobiography, \"\"Life Is Not an Accident: A Memoir of Reinvention\"\". Presently, Williams is the Spokesperson of Visions Federal Credit Union, headquartered in Endwell, New York. He was also an announcer in NBA Live 19.\n\nAccording to a May 2020 article on BlackEnterprise.com, Williams co-founded a management consulting company named Simatree, serves as a partial owner of The CabinNYC restaurant, works as an advisor to a digital marketing agency, and partners with EPIC Insurance to provide financial guidance to athletes and celebrities.\n\n"}

They are part of the Blue Ridge Mountain Province of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. The Unicois are located immediately south of the Great Smoky Mountains and immediately west of the Cheoah Mountains. Most of the range is protected as a national forest, namely the Cherokee National Forest on the Tennessee side and the Nantahala National Forest on the North Carolina side— although some parts have been designated as wilderness areas and are thus more strictly regulated.\n\nThe Unicoi Mountains remain one of the most primitive, undeveloped areas in the eastern United States. Human habitation in the range's river valleys and deep hollows was never more than sparse, and while logging occurred, logging operations in the Unicoi area were not as extensive as in other forested areas in the region. The Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest, located in the northeastern Unicois, is home to one of the last remaining old growth cove hardwood forests in the eastern United States. Grassy balds and heath balds are not an uncommon occurrence atop summits in the Unicoi Mountains, the highest of which rise to elevations of over 5,000 feet. The Cherohala Skyway— a National Scenic Byway completed in 1996— traverses the crest of the Unicoi Mountains connecting Tellico Plains, Tennessee with Robbinsville, North Carolina.\n\nThe name \"Unicoi\" comes from the Cherokee word ᎤᏁᎦ (\"unega),\" which means \"white.\" It refers to the low-lying clouds and fog that often drape the Southern Appalachian mountains in the early morning or on humid or moist days. The name \"Unaka\"— which historically refers to the mountains along the Tennessee–North Carolina border— has the same root as \"Unicoi.\"\n\nThe Unicoi Mountains stretch for roughly between the Little Tennessee River in the north and the Hiwassee River to the south, and for approximately from its foothills along the Tennessee River at the range's western extreme to the Cheoah River at its eastern extreme. The range covers just over .\n\nThe sources of several rivers and major streams are located high in the Unicoi Mountains. The Tellico River rises on the slopes of McDaniel Bald in the southeastern corner of the Unicois and flows northwestward across the entire range before emptying into the Little Tennessee River near Vonore, Tennessee. Another tributary of the Little Tennessee, Citico Creek, is formed by the convergence of two streams which rise in a densely forested area of the northwestern Unicois known as Jeffrey Hell. The Bald River rises on the slopes of Beaverdam Bald in the southern Unicois and winds its way northward through a scenic gorge before plunging over an oft-photographed waterfall en route to its mouth along the Tellico River. Santeetlah Creek rises on the western slope of Huckleberry Knob and flows down around the base of the mountain en route to the Santeetlah Lake impoundment of the Cheoah River to the east. Its tributary, Little Santeetlah Creek, drains the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest.\n\nThe highest summits in the Unicoi Range rise above 5,000 feet (1,500 meters), although most fall between 4,000 and 5,000 feet along the two crests and between 3,000 and 4,000 feet beyond the crest to the east and west. Huckleberry Knob— the highest mountain in the Unicoi Range at — has of topographical prominence. Other summits with 1,000+ feet of prominence include Bob Stratton Bald along the southern boundary of the Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness and Beaverdam Bald in the southern part of the range. The Benton MacKaye Trail, a cross-country hiking trail that traverses the Southern Appalachian Mountains, passes over several summits in the Unicois.\n\nThe Unicoi Mountains consist chiefly of Precambrian metasedimentary rocks of a type known as the Ocoee Supergroup, formed over a billion years ago from ancient ocean deposits. Quaternary Period rocks are sometimes found in alluvial areas along streambeds. The Unicoi Mountains were formed roughly 250 million years ago during the Alleghenian orogeny, when a continental collision thrust the rocks upward.\n\nThe Unicoi Mountains are coated by a primarily second-growth mixed hardwood and pine forest. Cove hardwood forests are typically found at the lower elevations along rivers and streams, and chiefly consist of yellow poplar, white oak, red oak, hemlock, and multiple other species. A mixed hardwood-pine forest covers the mountain slopes, and chiefly consists of white oak, red oak, hickory, table mountain pine, pitch pine, and shortleaf pine.\n\nWhile the vast majority of trees in the Unicoi Mountains are second-growth, the range is home to one of the few remaining stands of old growth forest in the eastern United States. The Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest along Little Santeetlah Creek is home to a substantial stand of virgin cove hardwood forest, and contains some of the oldest and tallest trees in the Unicoi Range. The largest trees in Joyce Kilmer are over tall and have circumferences of just over . The oldest trees in the forest are over 400 years old. Other stands of old growth forest include a patch around Falls Branch Falls and a remote section of the Citico Creek Wilderness near Glenn Gap.\n\nThe understories of the mountain slopes and ridgecrests are often covered by dense thickets of rhododendron and mountain laurel. These thickets are often called \"hells\" due to their general impassability. The most outstanding example of rhododendron-laurel thicket is Jeffrey Hell, located in the Citico Creek Wilderness. Grassy balds—a type of highland meadow consisting of fields of thick grass and sparse tree coverage—are not uncommon in the higher elevations. The summit of the highest mountain in the range—Huckleberry Knob—is a grassy bald. Other grassy balds include Oak Knob (a subpeak of Huckleberry), Hooper Bald, and Bob Bald (a subpeak of Stratton).\n\nFor centuries, Native Americans used a footpath in the southern Unicoi Mountains to travel from one side of the southern Appalachian range to the other. Known as the Wachesa Trail (after a later Cherokee who lived at its eastern terminus), the path stretched from modern Cowee to a halfway point near Beaverdam Creek and descended through Unicoi Gap to Great Tellico. Present-day Joe Brown Highway roughly follows the ancient trail.\n\nBy the time Euro-American explorers arrived in the region in the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Cherokee had established numerous villages in the outlying areas of the Unicoi Mountains. The Middle towns— located in the Robbinsville vicinity— included Tassetchee, Elijay, and Nequassee. The Overhill towns included Tallassee, Chilhowee, Citico, and numerous other villages in the Little Tennessee Valley at the range's northern extremes, Great Tellico along the Tellico River in modern Tellico Plains, and Great Hiwassee along the Hiwassee River at the western base of Starr Mountain. Excavations conducted at Citico (at the mouth of Citico Creek) revealed that it is a multiphase site, with periods of occupation stretching back thousands of years.\n\n16th-century Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to see the Unicoi Mountains. In 1540, the Hernando de Soto expedition passed just west of the mountains en route from the Chiaha villages in East Tennessee to the Coosa chiefdom in northern Georgia. In 1567, the Juan Pardo expedition visited the villages of \"Chalahume\" and \"Satapo\" (later Chilhowee and Citico) in the Little Tennessee Valley while attempting to find a route between Spanish settlements on the Atlantic coasts and Spanish settlements in Mexico.\n\nWhile English explorers and traders were probably using the Wachesa Trail as early as the 1690s, the first documented crossing was that of Colonel George Chicken in 1725. Chicken, a South Carolina emissary travelling to the Overhill towns in hopes of obtaining their support in the colony's ongoing struggles with the Creek tribe, left Little Tellico in the Middle towns at 10am on July 24, 1725 and proceeded approximately across the southern Unicois to a campsite \"about five Miles Short of a place called the Beaver Dam.\" Chicken's party departed at 5am the following morning and arrived at the village of Great Tellico at 3pm, having travelled another .\n\nIn 1730, Sir Alexander Cuming, a flamboyant English emissary, travelled from Charleston, South Carolina to the Overhill town of Tanasi in the lower Little Tennessee Valley in hopes of gaining the allegiance of the Cherokee for England (although Cuming's trip was part of an attempt to scam the people of Charleston). Cuming followed the same trail Chicken had taken five years earlier, departing from Tassetchee in the Middle towns and proceeding to a campsite \"3 miles from Beaver Dam Creek.\" The following day, Cuming's party passed over \"Ooneekawy Mountain\" and proceeded another to Great Tellico.\n\nAlthough the Unicoi Turnpike— which closely followed the old Wachesa Trail— was completed in 1816, the Unicoi Mountains remained largely devoid of all but a few mountain families. The family of John Stratton (1799–1862) settled in the area now known as Stratton Meadows (atop the main crest near where Cherohala Skyway crosses the state line) in the 1830s. John's father, Absolum, died while visiting his son in 1852 and is thus buried at Stratton Meadows. John's son, Robert \"Bob\" Stratton (1825–1864) eventually moved a few miles north of Stratton Meadows to the mountain that now bears his name, Stratton Bald. Stratton lived just west of the mountain's summit in a meadow now known as \"Bob Bald\" until 1864, when he was ambushed and killed by bushwhackers at the height of the U.S. Civil War.\n\nSometime after the Civil War, the family of John and Albertine Denton moved to Little Santeetlah Creek, where they built a log cabin. According to family lore, the Dentons lived in a hewed-out giant chestnut tree log while they were building their cabin. The log had a diameter of over and housed the entire family of seven in two rooms. The Denton family remained in the area until around 1900. The cabin was dismantled by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, and today only a chimney fall remains.\n\nAround 1911, George Gordon Moore— an official for the Whiting Manufacturing Company— attempted to establish a boar hunting reserve atop Hooper Bald in the southeastern Unicois. The reserve consisted of a enclosed lot stocked with Russian blue boars imported from Europe. Most of the boars were able to escape from the lot, however, and fled to the remote slopes and stream bottoms. The introduced boars continue to thrive in the Appalachian environment to this day. The boars are considered a nuisance by forest officials due to the erosion damage they cause to the local watersheds.\n\nIn 1915, the Babcock Lumber Company began a massive logging operation in the northern Unicoi Mountains. The company logged nearly two-thirds of the Slickrock Creek watershed until 1922, when the construction of Calderwood Dam along the Little Tennessee River threatened to flood the railroad tracks leading into the area and forcing an end to the company's logging operations in what is now the Joyce-Kilmer Slickrock Wilderness. That same year, however, Babcock began logging the Citico Creek watershed on the Tennessee side of the mountains. This operation continued until 1925, when a massive forest fire destroyed the company's logging tramways and wiped out nearly half the forest. The company continued low-scale logging in the Doublecamp area until 1929. The logging practices of Babcock and other logging companies proved extremely detrimental to the forest environment of the Unicoi Mountains, and the U.S. Forest Service began buying up the land in the 1930s. The forest service's policy of letting natural processes heal the forest has allowed the forest to recover to a great extent.\n\nIn 1958, Sam Williams— a resident of Tellico Plains— led a well-publicized covered wagon train across the Unicoi Mountains to Murphy, North Carolina, which became an annual event to promote the construction of a highway linking the Tennessee and North Carolina side of the Unicois. The original path of the highway would follow the ancient path of the Wachesa Trail and Unicoi Turnpike, although organizers chose a more feasible route over the Unicoi crest to Robbinsville. The highway— named \"Cherohala Skyway\" (a fusion of \"Cherokee\" and \"Nantahala\")— was completed in 1996.\n\nAlong with the Cherokee National Forest and the Nantahala National Forest, several designated areas protect various parts of the Unicoi Mountains.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The FX replaced the QX4 as Infiniti's mid-size SUV. It shares the same FM platform as the rear-wheel drive Nissan 370Z, and it \"made no claims of climbing mountains.\" Rather, its aggressive shape promised style and quick handling. The similarly sized Nissan Murano is based on the same D platform as the front-wheel drive Nissan Altima. The FX does not have Nissan-branded equivalent, and is not sold in Japan.\n\nThe FX introduced its second generation for the 2009 model year as the FX35 and FX50.\n\nThe nameplates FX35 and FX45 refer to the two available engines. The FX35 is available in two drivetrains, the RWD and the AWD, which are both fitted to a dual overhead cam 3.5-liter 24-valve V6 VQ35DE gasoline engine, with aluminum-alloy block and heads, electronically controlled throttle system, and low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons that makes use of the continuous variable valve timing which in part optimizes the opening of intake valves. This is also coupled with an electronically controlled super-wide ratio five-speed automatic with a manumatic shift mode that includes the option of sequentially selected manual gearshifts and downshift rev matching.\n\nThe AWD FX45 incorporates a 4.5-liter (4,494 cc) 32-valve V8 DOHC VK45DE gasoline engine with four valves per cylinder, microfinished camshafts with aluminum-alloy block and heads, low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons, titanium intake and exhaust valves, modular cylinder heads, microfinished crankshaft, lightweight pistons, super-silent single stage cam drive chain, and a Continuously Variable Valve Timing Control System that optimizes opening of intake valves. Development began in 1999 under newly appointed CEO Carlos Ghosn's NRP. Design work was completed in rapid succession in 2000, for late 2002 production. Designed prior to that, earlier on in 2000 under the \"Bionic Cheetah\" theme, the 2001 Infiniti FX45 Concept was introduced at the NAIAS in January 2001. From mid-2001, a new concept based on the production design was developed and completed in late 2001. Sketches were first released in late November 2001. The second-generation 2002 FX45 Concept was introduced in January 2002 at the NAIAS '02 as a thinly-veiled production FX (S50) and planned production was announced for early 2003. In January 2003, the 2003 FX45 made its debut at the 2003 NAIAS and went on sale January 24, 2003.\n\nIn 2003 for the 2004 model, changes were the addition of a standard eight-way power front passenger seat that replaced the previous four-way design, the availability of aluminum roof rails and chrome-plated 20-inch wheels. Also new were a dark silver metallic finish for the 20-inch wheels (non-chrome-plated), the addition of a standard HVAC filter for all models and the addition of a new Snow-Mode function.\n\nIn September 2004 for the 2005 model year, the FX range received enhancements such as lane departure warning (LDW) system that helps alert drivers to an unintended movement of the vehicle out of a designated traffic lane. Infiniti's system monitored the lane markings to alert passengers via an audible buzzer that the driver is drifting unintentionally. The LDW system, which utilize a small camera, speed sensor, an indicator and an audible warning buzzer, was offered on models. The 2005 Infiniti FX was the first passenger vehicle to offer a lane departure warning system in the United States market. \nIn addition to LDW, the 2005 Infiniti FX range was now equipped with standard roof-mounted curtain supplemental curtain airbags with rollover protection for front and rear outboard seat occupants.\n\nOther changes included the addition of dark chrome grille, headlight and clear taillight accents to the FX45 (also available as part of the V6 Sport Package on FX35 models), a new key fob design for the Infiniti Intelligent Key system and two new exterior colors, Sapphire and Sheer Platinum. Interior changes included a new standard etched aluminum trim.\n\nTotal 2007 sales of the FX45 were 1,598 units, about a tenth of the FX35s.\n\nThe FX series was updated for the 2006 model year with new options and standard features. The updates included an exterior facelift with new grille, bumper, wheel design and three new exterior colors, and inside a revised center console with new color screen. Many features previously optional were made standard, including the 300-watt Bose audio system, RearView Monitor, 7-inch color display, Advanced Air Bag System (AABS), leather seating surfaces with heated front seats, ten-way power driver's seat with power lumbar support and eight-way power passenger's seat.\n\nThe FX45 featured additional upgrades, including new 20-inch wheels, leather-appointed seats, a revised sport-tuned four-wheel independent suspension with new dampers, a Bluetooth system, and the Premium Package became standard. Sales began in January 2006, after production commencement in November 2005. Production of the S50 ended in February 2008.\n\nFX35: \n\nFX45: \n\nThe redesigned 2009 Infiniti FX was officially unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show on March 4, 2008, and went on sale in June 2008. The V6 model was still called FX35 with the VQ35HR V6, but the V8 model was renamed FX50 in recognition of its 5-liter engine, the newly developed VK50VE.\n\nThe exterior retained some of the first generation's \"Bionic Cheetah\" look and \"giant scarab\" profile, while incorporating new styling cues. Features of the new design included longer, shark-like sculpted headlights, a large trapezoidal grille filled with horizontal dark-chrome waves, and functional side air vents. The overall size and dimensions of the new model, both external and internal, remained similar to the previous model.\n\nThe interior was completely redesigned to bring the FX up to the level of luxury found inside of other Infiniti models like the G37 and EX35. Features included stitched leather seats, stained maple wood or piano black finishes, and matte-finish surfaces.\n\nFront suspension was a new double-wishbone design, similar to that found on the G37 and EX35; this replaced the previous generation FX's front strut-type suspension. The suspension's upper and lower A-arms were designed to improve control of a wheel's motion, especially when the suspension compresses and extends, providing more travel than the previous strut design. The body was also designed to be 1.6 times more torsionally rigid and 3.4 times more resistant to bending than the previous model. All Wheel Drive (AWD) was standard, and notably, Infiniti's AWD system always engages a 50:50 power split when stationary, ensuring maximum off-the line traction at all times. Up to 100 percent of the engines power can be sent to the rear wheels when needed, with a maximum of 50 percent available to the front.\n\nA Europe-specific FX37 was unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor Show, and went on sale in Europe in October, 2008 with the VQ37VHR. Europeans get the 325-hp FX37 as their entry level model instead of the FX35, which will be available in FX37 GT and FX37S versions. The FX37 GT came equipped with 20-inch alloy wheels, power and heated/ventilated front seats, adaptive xenon headlamps, parking camera sensors, all-wheel-drive, and a 7-speed automatic with paddle shifting. The FX37S added 21-inch alloy wheels, Continuous Damping Control, and sports seats.\n\nA Europe-specific FX30d was released in late 2010, powered by a new 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel V9X Engine. The engine was developed by the Renault-Nissan Alliance, and will also power the EX and M models.\n\nThis engine, which is the first diesel in Infiniti's history, was specifically designed to deliver high levels of refined performance in line with Infiniti philosophy. Although a V8 diesel engine was entertained, the V6 format was selected early on as the ideal layout for the unit, providing the optimum balance between overall performance and refinement.\n\nThe engine produces a total of and of torque. Peak torque can be achieved from as low as 1,750 rpm and is available all the way to 2,500 rpm, while as much as is available from a mere 1,500 rpm. Idle speed is an exceptionally low 650 rpm with none of the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) usually associated with a diesel.\n\nStandard comfort features include dual-zone automatic climate control, a premium 11-speaker, 300 watt Bose stereo with in-dash 6 CD changer and 2GB hard drive, steering wheel mounted audio controls, premium leather seating surfaces, heated front bucket seats, heated power mirrors, 10-way power driver seat w/ lumbar adjustment, 8-way power passenger seat, individual driver memory system (drivers seat, side mirrors, and steering wheel positions), RearView back-up camera, UV reflective glass, and Infiniti's Intelligent Key system. The Intelligent Key design from the first generation FX now incorporates a Push Button Ignition system. With this system, the driver does not have to remove keys to drive the vehicle; a simple electronic fob carried on the driver allows the driver to lock/unlock and start the vehicle keyless.\n\nOther standard features include Scratch Shield paint (first introduced on the Infiniti EX), black lacquer interior trim, high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps, LED brake lamps, 12-point sequential welcome lighting, electronic liftgate closure assist, automatic dimming rear-view mirror with compass, glass moonroof, rear privacy glass, integrated rear spoiler, and dual chrome exhaust tips.\n\nStandard safety features include dual front air bags, side impact airbags, and rear curtain airbags with rollover sensor, as well as Zone Body construction with front and rear crumple zones.\n\nOptions include Infiniti's Hard Drive Navigation with touch screen and 3D building images, All-Around View Monitor (first introduced on the Infiniti EX) which displays a virtual bird's-eye view of the vehicle and surroundings to aide in parking, and Intelligent Cruise Control, which provides the benefits of standard cruise control with the ability to add speed and distance intervals, as well as automatically slowing the vehicle in slowing traffic to help provide a safe distance. When traffic flow ahead speeds up, Intelligent Cruise Control then reaccelerates to the preset speed and distance settings. Optional industry-first Distance Control Assist intuitively helps the driver release the throttle and apply the brakes as needed in slowing traffic. Another option, Forward Collision Warning uses the Intelligent Cruise system's laser rangefinder to alert the driver of a potential collision, and if the driver does not respond, Brake Assist automatically engages the brakes to help reduce collision speed and impact. The Premium Package adds heated and cooled front seats, a power adjustable steering wheel, iPod integration system, folding outdoor mirrors, and aluminum paddle shifters to adjust the gears when using the manual shift mode.\n\nAll 2009 FX models came standard with Infiniti's new 7-speed automatic transmission, which was also introduced on the 2009 G37 coupe.\n\nThe FX35 (U.S.) is available in both rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configuration, while the FX35 (Canada), FX37 (Europe) and FX50 (all) come standard with all-wheel drive. The FX uses Nissan's ATTESA E-TS all-wheel drive system.\n\nAll FX50 models ordered with the Sport package (FX50S) come equipped with Active Steering package. This package features a planetary gearset on the steering shaft (similar to BMW), that varies the steering ratio between 12.0:1 and 18.5:1. The package also includes a rear-wheel steering system that induces up to one degree of steer to the rear wheels, to provide increased handling response for the vehicle.\n\nChanges to the Infiniti FX include a redesigned front grille and front fascia design, revised meter illumination, standard heated front seats on all models, a new exterior color, Graphite Shadow (replaces Platinum Graphite), a new 20-inch wheel design for the FX35 Deluxe Touring Package, addition of Adaptive Front lighting System (AFS) to the FX50 Sport Package, a shift of the quilted leather climate-controlled front seats to the FX35 Deluxe Touring Package from the Premium Package.\n\nThe Limited Edition is based on the FX35 AWD, with exclusive Iridium Blue body color, 21-inch 10-spoke dark finish aluminum-alloy turbine wheels, Infiniti Hard Drive Navigation System, Around View Monitor, dark tinted adaptive headlamps, and dark tinted side air vents and lower door trim.\n\nUS models went on sale in October 2011. Early models included FX35, FX35 AWD, FX50 AWD.\n\nIt is a version of the Infiniti FX50 with Moonlight White body colour, matte white exterior color, F1-inspired carbon fiber front air dam with white LED running lights, F1-inspired side skirts and rear air dam, 21-inch 10-spoke black-finish aluminum wheels, dark tinted adaptive headlamps, dark tinted rear tail lamps, satin aluminum door handles, side air vents and exterior trim, carbon fiber rear wing, carbon fiber interior trim, F1-inspired steering wheel and suede seating surfaces, unique Sebastian Vettel badging on the side fenders, rear liftgate, interior center console and embroidered front seats; increased engine power to , a front air dam providing increased downforce, 20 millimeters lower ride height and 30 percent improved coefficient of drag over the standard FX.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show by Formula 1 driver Sebastian Vettel.\n\nIt is a limited (150 units (50 in Western Europe)) version of the Infiniti FX50 based on the Sebastian Vettel Edition concept, with Moonlight White body colour.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.\n\nUK models went on sale for £100,800, with a carbon rear spoiler available at an extra cost.\n\nFX35:\n\nFX37 (Europe):\n\nFX50:\n\nAll vehicles are built at Nissan Motor Company's plant in Tochigi, Japan.\nFrom 2013, also build at Nissan Motor Company's plant in Shushari, Saint-Petersburg,Russia until 2014.\n\nChanges to the Infiniti FX include the removal of the Limited Edition model.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in the 2013 Geneva Motor Show.\n\nUS models went on sale in June 2013 as 2014 model year vehicles. Early models included QX70 5.0 AWD, QX70 3.7 AWD and QX70 3.7. 5.0 AWD was last offered in the U.S. in the 2014 model year.\n\nIn August 2013, total of 3,026 QX70 vehicles were delivered, for total of 20,556 vehicles.\n\nThree QX70 vehicles were used in the Riyadh campaigned titled 'Inspired Light by Infiniti'.\n\nThe QX70 Limited was unveiled in the 2016 New York International Auto Show.\n\nUS models of QX70 Limited went on sale in summer 2016, followed by QX70 3.7, QX70 3.7 AWD.\n\nIn July 2017, dealers were notified that the QX70 — formerly known as Infiniti FX — will not be offered in the 2018 model year. \n\n"}

The supposed jump, of which the veracity was disputed, gave Brodie publicity, a thriving saloon and a career as a performer.\n\nBrodie's fame persisted long past his death, with Brodie portrayed in films and with the slang term \"Brodie\"—as in to \"do a Brodie\"—entering American vernacular, meaning to take a chance or a leap, specifically a suicidal one.\n\nThe bridge, then known as the East River Bridge, had opened just three years before Brodie's claimed jump. A swimming instructor from Washington, D.C. named Robert Emmet Odlum, the brother of women's rights activist Charlotte Odlum Smith, was killed while attempting the same stunt in May 1885.\n\nThe jump supposedly made by Brodie on July 23, 1886, was from a height of , the same as a 14-storey building. The contemporary \"New York Times\" account said the jump was from a height of about .\n\nThe \"New York Times\" backed his account of the jump and said that Brodie practiced for the leap by making shorter jumps from other bridges and ships' masts, and that it was witnessed by two reporters. He leaped into the East River, feet first, and emerged uninjured, though with pain on his right side. He was jailed after the jump. \"The Times\" described Brodie as a \"newsboy and long-distance pedestrian\" who jumped from the bridge to win a $200 bet, equal to $ today. In other accounts he is described as a bookmaker and gambler.\n\nA Bowery storekeeper named Isaac Meyers claimed that he encouraged Brodie to jump off the Brooklyn bridge after Brodie said that he wanted to be famous.\n\nAnother account holds that Moritz Herzber, a liquor dealer, offered to back a saloon for Brodie if he made the jump and lived.\n\nIf true, he would have been the first person to have jumped off the bridge and survived, but his claim was disputed. It was subsequently claimed that a dummy was thrown from the bridge and that Brodie fell out of a row boat.\n\nAfter the jump, Brodie opened a saloon at 114 Bowery near Grand Street, which also became a museum for his bridge-jumping stunt. Among the decorations was an affidavit from the boat captain who claimed to have pulled him from the water. He became an actor capitalizing on his reputation, appearing in the vaudeville musicals \"Mad Money\" and \"On the Bowery\", and opened a saloon in Buffalo, New York.\n\nBrodie died in San Antonio, Texas, in 1901. The cause of death has been variously described as diabetes and tuberculosis.\n\nDoubt whether Brodie actually made the claimed jump arose immediately and has lingered to this day. \n\nBrodie, who was unemployed and aware of the publicity generated by Odlum's fatal jump, bragged to his pals on the Bowery that he would take the jump. Wagers were made for and against, but Brodie never announced when he would make the attempt. The \"Brooklyn Eagle\" reported in 1930 that a retired police sergeant and friend of Brodie, Thomas K. Hastings, said that Brodie had told him that he didn't make the leap and never said he did. \n\nIn his book \"The Great Bridge\", historian David McCullough said that he probably did not make the jump. McCullough said that it was commonly believed by skeptics that a dummy was dropped from the bridge, and that Brodie merely swam out from shore and surfaced beside a passing barge.\n\nThe NYPD said in 1986, the 100th anniversary of the supposed jump, that two or three people jump from the bridge every year and some live. Only one month after Brodie's jump, Larry Donovan jumped from an even higher point of the bridge, making him the first confirmed survivor of a Brooklyn Bridge leap.\n\nBrodie became a popular symbol of the Bowery and appeared personally in musical shows, and his character was used many times in film depictions of old New York. He starred in a three-act play titled \"On the Bowery\" by Robert Neilson Stephens, which opened in 1894. A facsimile of Brodie's saloon was the setting for the second act, and Brodie sang a song, \"My Poil is a Bowery Goil\". Valerie Bergere played Blanche Livingstone, the girl he rescues and then falls in love with. The play culminated with Brodie jumping off the bridge. \n\nGeorge Raft portrayed Brodie in the 1933 movie \"The Bowery\" which presents a fictional account of Brodie's dive. Years later, an actor named John Stevenson used Brodie's name for his movie stage name.\nIn the 1946 noir film \"The Dark Corner\" (starring Lucille Ball and Mark Stevens), a Taxi Driver, when asked about William Bendix's gangster character falling to his death, said he \"[n]ever saw anyone ever pull a Brodie and bounce.\"\nIn 1949, Warner Brothers released the Merrie Melodies cartoon \"Bowery Bugs\", in which Bugs Bunny tells an old man the story of the Steve Brodie jump (in typical \"Looney Tunes\" fashion, of course; in the episode Brodie's name is spelled \"BRODY\" on a plaque on the bridge in the spot where \"Brody\" supposedly jumped from). It's never mentioned in the cartoon whether or not Bugs was trying to sell the old man the Brooklyn Bridge or simply the story of \"Brody's\" jump. At the end, Bugs says to the old man, \"And that's why Steve Brody jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. Anything more you want to know?\" and the old man replies, \"Nope. That's enough, son. I'll buy it\". Bugs then breaks the fourth wall with a wink as the old man starts counting money into Bugs's hand.\n\nThe disastrous 1965 Broadway musical \"Kelly (musical)\" was inspired by Brodie and climaxes with the lead character Hop Kelly completing the dive.\n\nThe phrase \"taken a Brody\" is used in Thomas Pynchon's 1963 novel \"V.\": \"And next day she would read in the paper where Esther Harvitz, twenty-two, honors graduate of CCNY, had taken a Brody off some bridge, overpass or high building.\" Pynchon also used in The Crying of Lot 49: \"...my best guide to the Trystero has taken a Brody.\" It also appears in David Foster Wallace's 1996 novel \"Infinite Jest\": \"McDade bitched at the meeting that if he had to watch \"Nightmare on Elm Street XXII: The Senescence\" one more time he was going to take a brody off the House's roof.\"\n"}

It is a type of soft tissue sarcoma.\n\nThe name \"synovial sarcoma\" was coined early in the 20th century, as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to synovium, and its propensity to arise adjacent to joints, indicated a synovial origin; however, the actual cells from which the tumor develops are unknown and not necessarily synovial.\n\nPrimary synovial sarcomas are most common in the soft tissue near the large joints of the arm and leg but have been documented in most human tissues and organs, including the brain, prostate, and heart.\nSynovial sarcoma occurs in about 1-2 per 1,000,000 people a year. They occur most commonly in the third decade of life, with males being affected more often than females (ratio around 1.2:1).\n\nSynovial sarcoma usually presents with an otherwise asymptomatic swelling or mass, although general symptoms related to malignancies can be reported such as fatigue.\n\nThe diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t(X;18) chromosomal translocation.\n\nTwo cell types can be seen microscopically in synovial sarcoma. One fibrous type, known as a spindle or sarcomatous cell, is relatively small and uniform, and found in sheets. The other is epithelial in appearance. Classical synovial sarcoma has a biphasic appearance with both types present. Synovial sarcoma can also appear to be poorly differentiated or to be monophasic fibrous, consisting only of sheets of spindle cells. Some authorities state that, extremely rarely, there can be a monophasic epithelial form which causes difficulty in differential diagnosis. Depending on the site, there is similarity to biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, although the genetic findings are distinctive.\n\nLike other soft tissue sarcomas, there is no universal grading system for reporting histopathology results. In Europe, the Trojani or French system is gaining in popularity while the NCI grading system is more common in the United States. The Trojani system scores the sample, depending on tumour differentiation, mitotic index, and tumour necrosis, between 0 and 6 and then converts this into a grade of between 1 and 3, with 1 representing a less aggressive tumour. The NCI system is also a three-grade one, but takes a number of other factors into account.\n\nMost, and perhaps all, cases of synovial sarcoma are associated with a reciprocal translocation t(x;18)(p11.2;q11.2). There is some debate about whether the molecular observation itself is definitive of synovial sarcoma.\n\nThe diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t(X;18). This translocation event between the SS18 gene on chromosome 18 and one of 3 SSX genes (SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4) on chromosome X causes the presence of an SS18-SSX fusion gene. The resulting fusion protein brings together the transcriptional activating domain of SS18 and the transcriptional repressor domains of SSX. It also incorporates into the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, a well known tumor suppressor. SS18-SSX is thought to underlie synovial sarcoma pathogenesis through dysregulation of gene expression.\n\nThere is some association between the SS18-SSX1 or SS18-SSX2 fusion type and both tumour morphology and five-year survival.\n\nTreatment is usually multimodal, involving surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy:\n\n\n"}

His body of work also preserves and rescues the elements of the psychology, idiosyncrasy, customs and slang of the afro-American culture.\n\nFacing the subject of the difference between classes, Ortiz used his characters to personalize and flesh out these political themes into very human and realistic stories. A specific point he touches in the novel \"Juyungo\", for example, is the relationship of the Black and Mestizo races (personified by Lastre's descendant and the Mestizo Diaz).\n\nOutside of the aspects of social commentary, Ortiz's prose is celebrated and acclaimed as possessing singular beauty and elegance.\n\nIn 1995 the Ecuadorian Government awarded him with the Eugenio Espejo National Prize celebrating the entirety of his work.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

With this album, the band settled on what would, from then on, be their primary lineup: vocalist Elizabeth Fraser, guitarist Robin Guthrie and bass guitarist Simon Raymonde. This new lineup also coincided with the development of the ethereal sound associated with the band's music.\n\nThe album reached number 29 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the band's first UK Top 40 album, and charted for eight weeks. It also became one of the band's most critically successful releases, although the band considered it underdeveloped.\n\nThe album was recorded from August to September 1984 at Palladium Studios, Edinburgh and Rooster, West London.\n\nRaymonde alluded to it being rushed and unfinished, while Guthrie referred to it as \"an abortion\" and to the period in which it was made as \"arty-farty pre-Raphaelite\". Nonetheless, as Raymonde observed, \"It seems to be the one that people like the best and it's probably sold the best\".\n\n\"Treasure\" is considered by many fans to be the band's finest work, and has received critical acclaim. \"Pitchfork\" wrote, \"Cocteau Twins' third album was titled simply enough. \"Treasure\" was an adjective for the endlessly inventive melodic lines you'd find buried in these songs, and a verb for what you'd do with them for years to come\", and noted that the record signaled the start of the Cocteau Twins' \"signature ethereality\". Ned Raggett of AllMusic complimented its \"accomplished variety\", saying, \"\"Treasure\" lives up to its title and then some as a thorough and complete triumph\". \"BBC Online\" wrote, \"\"Treasure\" was where the Cocteau Twins first got it 100 percent right\". \"Melody Maker\" described the album as \"true brilliance\" and stated that the band were \"the voice of God\".\n\nIn March 2018, the album was repressed on 180g vinyl using new masters created from high definition files transferred from the original analogue tapes.\n\nJennifer Makowsky of \"PopMatters\" included the album on the \"12 Essential Alternative Rock Albums from the 1980s\" list and wrote that the album stood the test of time and paved the way for bands like Sigur Rós and Beach House. Jeff Terich of \"Treblezine\" placed the album on his list of best dream pop albums, stating: \"In contrast to the band's more abrasive post-punk albums that arrived earlier, \"Treasure\" is an exercise in making beauty seem alien, and making alienation seem sublime, for that matter\". \"Slant Magazine\" listed the album at No. 74 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s, while \"NME\" named \"Treasure\" the 37th best album of 1984. \"Pitchfork\" listed \"Treasure\" as the 98th best album of the 1980s. \"Paste\" magazine's Josh Jackson listed the album at No. 38 on his list of \"The 50 Best Post-Punk Albums\", describing it as \"the first full realization of the band's ethereal pop sound\". \"PopMatters\" included it in their list of the \"12 Essential 1980s Alternative Rock Albums\" saying, \"Fraser's ability to deliver her nonsensical lyrics with the diaphanous touch of a moth or with the muscle of a ravenous lion is astonishing\". Jennifer Makowsky concluded that \"\"Treasure\" is an aptly titled album\". The album was included in the 2008 edition of \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".

His great-grandfather Gerhard the Great, having also been a Regent of the Kingdom of Denmark, had received the Duchy of Sønderjylland from the Danish crown as a hereditary fief. It had been lost for the Schauenburgs between 1330 and 1375, with Queen Margaret I of Denmark restricting the regained ducal power in 1386, and again from 1414 to 1440.\n\nCount Adolph's parents were Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and Catherine Elisabeth of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Adolph was only three years old when his father was killed in action against the Ditmarsians in the Battle at Hamme near Heide (today's Schleswig-Holstein), on 4 August 1404. Adolph was educated at the court of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg at Hohenzollern Castle.\n\nAdolph's elder brother Henry IV succeeded their father. As Duke of Schleswig, he was under the tutelage of the Danish crown due to his minority until 1414. However, then the crown denied Henry's claim to dukedom. Henry and his mother and brothers stood together and fought for his claim. During the Danish-Holstein-Hanseatic war Henry was killed in action beleaguering Flensburg on 28 May 1427.\n\nAdolph and his younger brother Gerhard VII then succeeded Henry as Counts of Holstein-Rendsburg, continuing their efforts to receive the Duchy of Schleswig. However, Gerhard died in 1433 in Emmerich upon Rhine. In July 1435 Adolph and the Danish King Eric of Pomerania concluded the second Treaty of Vordingborg at Vordingborg Castle, confirming Adolph's de facto holdings in Schleswig duchy. In 1439, the new Danish King Christopher III acquired the loyalty of Adolph by granting him the entire Duchy of Schleswig as a hereditary Danish fief. Adolph's lands were located in both sides of the border between Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe current branch of Danish royal house became extinct in 1448 with the death of Christopher III of Denmark. Adolph was a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark, whose mother Queen Dowager Margaret Sambiria had obtained a papal confirmation of the right of also female descendancy of Christopher I of Denmark to succeed to the throne of Denmark. Adolph was also the cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophia; Christopher III was the last descendant of King Abel's sons.\nThe throne was offered by the Rigsråd to Adolph, who as Duke of Schleswig, was the vassal with the biggest holdings in the Danish realm. Adolph, by that time old and childless, declined and supported the candidacy of his own nephew the Count of Oldenburg who became Christian I of Denmark.\n\nAdolph was married on 5 March 1435, to Margaret of Höllenstein of the German noble family of Hohnstein. They had one son, who died young. In 1459 Adolph died and left no descendants to inherit. His sisters were the late Helvig (Hedwig), who was married with Dietrich, Count of Oldenburg and had left children, and the elderly Ingeborg of Holstein, Abbess of Vadstena, who lived as a nun and was both unmarried and childless. His brother Gerhard had mixed twins, with the son Henry drowned still young and the daughter Catherine a nun in Preetz Priory. There were several claimants to Holstein-Rendsburg and Schleswig, since then the Schauenburgs still continued to rule the County of Holstein-Pinneberg in the male line, and several extinct lines of the family, counts of different parts of Holstein, had left female offspring and their cognatic heirs. Adolph's branch was not genealogically very senior.\n\nThe representatives of Schleswig and Holstein (nobility and some delegates of the Estates) convened in Ribe where, on 5 March 1460, the succession was confirmed to Christian I of Denmark, the eldest nephew of the late Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein-Rendsburg.\n\nHis seal shows the coats-of-arms of Schleswig (two lions) and Holstein (the so-called stylised \"nettle leaf\"). The inscription says: SIGILLUM*ADOLPHI*DUCIS*SLEVICENSIS*HOLTSACIE*COMITIS (Seal • of Adolphus • Duke • of Schleswig • Holstein's • Count)\n\n\nThis article derives mainly from the 2nd edition (JH Schultz Forlag. 1915 to 1930).\n\n"}

Many archaeological sites have been discovered in the gorge that show that people have been dwelling in the canyon for at least 10,000 years.\n\nPrior to the completion of Hales Bar Dam in 1913 and the subsequent raising of the water-level, the stretch of the Tennessee River flowing through the Gorge was notorious for its navigational hazards, whirlpools, eddies, shoals, and one huge rock.

Populations have been documented from four Tennessee counties and nine Georgia counties and is protected under the US Endangered Species act as it is a threatened species. The Latin specific epithet \"montana\" refers to mountains or coming from mountains.\n\nThis plant has a single, erect square stem and may grow 30 to 60 cm in height. The leaves are simple, opposite in arrangement, lanceolate to ovate with crenate to serrate margins, and the blades are 5 to 8 cm long and 3 to 5 cm wide. Characteristic to this species, the leaves have a soft pubescence with glandular and non-glandular hairs on both surfaces. As the common name suggests, the inflorescence are large at 2.6 to 3.5 cm long; flowers are terminal and blue and white in color. Another characteristic specific to this species and used to distinguish it from other \"Scutellaria\" species is that the inflorescence lack an annulus within the corolla tube near the top of the calyx; this is the only species of the genus that is exannulate. Flowers bloom from mid-May to June, and fruits mature in June and early July.\n\nThis plant grows in mid- to late-successional forests dominated by oak and pine trees, most often \"Quercus alba\", \"Q. velutina\", and/or \"Q. montana\", and \"Pinus echinata\" or \"P. taeda\". The soil is acidic, rocky, and shallow, sometimes as shallow as 3 centimeters. It is dry to somewhat moist in the habitat.

It was developed by Racdym and published by Atlus. Many reviewers compared its style to that of the \"Mario Kart\" series. An enhanced port, Snowboard Kids Plus, was released in Japan in January 1999 for the PlayStation.\n\nIn addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, \"Snowboard Kids\" adds \"Shots\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.\n\nThe game has nine main courses. Although many of the courses are snowy mountains, some are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival. Each track has a unique shape, containing various obstacles, hazards, and short-cuts.\n\nThere are two item slots, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Players are required to pay 100 gold in order to collect an item during a race. Gold can be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also require players to race down the hill for multiple laps. At the bottom of the hill, the player needs to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and cannot be attacked by other players in this transition.\n\n\"Snowboard Kids\" features six playable characters: Slash, Nancy, Jam, Linda, Tommy, and Shinobin, the last being the only unlockable character in the game, becoming available after the player completes all nine tracks. The characters have three aspects which affect their racing style: speed, which determines the straight line speed of the character; corner, which determines how quickly the character is able to turn; and trick, which determines the hangtime characters get while jumping, allowing for tricks to be executed to earn the player coins.\n\nThe game was showcased at the Tokyo Game Show held on September 5-7, 1997.\n\nThe game was generally well received by critics. IGN gave the game an 8 out of 10 score, favorably comparing the game to the \"Mario Kart\" series, referring to the game as \"a solid title that incorporates the graphic and gameplay styles of Mario Kart into a snowboarding environment. The result is a satisfyingly cute snow racer that's sure to please gamers more interested in a simplistic shreddin' experience than a realistic one.\" Nintendo Life gave the game a 7 out of 10 rating, concluding that the game had \"bold, colourful graphics, tons of charm, memorable tunes and, most importantly, tight gameplay, Snowboard Kids is worthy of a place in anyone’s collection. Atlus’s first foray into the world of snowboarding on the Nintendo 64 may not present a particularly lengthy challenge or deep experience, but it can always be relied upon to provide a quick blast of fun now and then, alone or with friends.\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"In the final analysis, \"Snowboard Kids\" is an entertaining title that, despite its lack of originality, does most things right. Considering the infrequency of truly compelling N64 titles, gamers could do worse than spending some time on the slopes with \"Snowboard Kids\".\"\n\nThe game would lead to several future releases in the series. In 1999, a sequel, \"Snowboard Kids 2\", was released for the Nintendo 64. The series lay dormant for seven years, until a new entry in the series, \"\", was released for the Nintendo DS in 2005.\n"}

They began flying charters and scenic flights from the Bar Harbor town dock. By 1950, they had established a base of operations at the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport.\n\nBar Harbor Airlines started flying in 1971, using the Hancock County Airport as its hub. The airline's first route was to Boston.\n\nThe route proved so popular, especially among those from Maine who had daily jobs in Boston, that by 1972, the airline expanded its route system by 350 percent, including seven cities and becoming an international airline, with a flight from Boston to Quebec City in Canada. It adopted the slogan, \"Linking Maine With the World\".\n\nBy 1974, the airline offered round-trip services between each city it served. Being a commuter airline made this easy, as each of its services consisted of short flights with quick turnaround times, and, with a large number of aircraft available, Bar Harbor had hubs in every city it served. During the 1970s, Bar Harbor Airlines primarily used Cessna 402's and 310's, later adding Beech 99 aircraft.\n\nThe airline also offered cargo service to the destinations it served. Bar Harbor's first crash, on August 16, 1976, was on a cargo flight from Bangor International Airport in Bangor, Maine, to Bar Harbor. The airplane carried only one person, the pilot, and he was not injured. Peter Monighetti, chief pilot for the airline, was ferrying a Beechcraft 99 airplane from Bangor when the plane crashed on a ridge in Lamoine, Maine. Monighetti had been making an approach upon Bar Harbor Airport, located across the Jordan River in Trenton, Maine.\n\nIn May 1978, the company announced the establishment service between Portland and Hartford, Maine. At this time, T. J. Caruso was president of the company.\n\nThe airline's second accident proved to be tragic. On May 16, 1978, a flight carrying company founder Thomas Caruso, his son Gary Caruso (Vice President of the Company) and two other company pilots, Peter Monighetti and Malcolm Connell, crashed in heavy fog near Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton, Maine. There were no survivors. The cause of the crash was later ruled to be a manufacturer defect and several family members of the crash victims received cash settlements from the manufacturer of the aircraft.\n\nOn August 25, 1985, a Beechcraft Model 99 operating as Flight 1808 crashed while landing in Auburn, Maine. Two crew members and six passengers, including Samantha Smith, died in the crash.\n\nOther than the crash in 1985 of a Beechcraft that carried Samantha Smith, the airline did not receive much bad publicity outside New England after the accident. This was partly because commuter air carriers are generally known only around the communities they serve. Bar Harbor Airlines decided to make Boston's Logan International Airport its only permanent base, apart from the Bar Harbor airport hub. Also during this decade, the airline bought some Convair 600, CASA C-212 Aviocar, Saab 340, Beechcraft 1900, and ATR 42 turboprop aircraft, putting them into service immediately. Bar Harbor began to operate flights under a code-share agreement with Eastern Air Lines, and later with Continental Airlines.\n\nAs of 1982, Bar Harbor had an agreement with Eastern Airlines to handle reservations at some airports.\n\nIn April 1987, Texas Air Corporation purchased 50% of Bar Harbor Airlines and arrange for the sale of its own Provincetown-Boston Airlines (PBA) to Bar Harbor. Texas Air had acquired PBA through its merger with People Express, and already owned Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines. At the time, Provincetown-Boston (PBA) was operating as Continental Express, and Bar Harbor as Eastern Express. Texas Air continued to operate the consolidated PBA/Bar Harbor as a commuter carrier for both Continental and Eastern, with hub operations at Boston, New York/LaGuardia, Newark, Philadelphia, Tampa and Miami.\n\nIn October 1988, a Bar Harbor commuter flight was involved in an incident where it came much closer than usual to Air Force One, with Ronald Reagan on board, during both plane's descent to Newark, New Jersey; the incident was found to be due to a cumulation of errors at four separate FAA facilities along the east coast.\n\nIn 1989 Bar Harbor moved its headquarters to Houston, Texas from Maine after the state refused to renew a multimillion-dollar tax break.\n\nWith additional aircraft financing, Texas Air International (through Eastern Air Lines and Continental Airlines) acquired a majority interest in Bar Harbor. Bar Harbor stopped flying its older aircraft and the older PBA aircraft by the beginning of 1990 in favor of newer, modern aircraft. After Eastern's strike, bankruptcy filing, and ultimate separation from Texas Air, Bar Harbor too had to be divided between the two carriers. The aircraft fleet was divided between the two parents; the Saab 340s and Beechcraft 99s went to Eastern, and the ATR 42s went to Continental. The routes were divided between the two carriers. The Miami and Tampa hubs went to Eastern and continued operating as Eastern Express, while the Newark, LaGuardia, and Boston hubs went to Continental and operated as Continental Express. Employees were given the choice of going with either the Eastern Express division or the Continental Express portion of Bar Harbor. The Bar Harbor Airlines name and operating certificate ironically went to Eastern for the Florida operation. Continental then merged the New England portion of Bar Harbor and PBA with its other commuter carriers: Britt Airways (based in Terre Haute, Indiana) and Rocky Mountain Airways (based in Denver), and operated Continental Express under the Britt Airways certificate.\n\nBar Harbor Airlines and its parent Eastern Airlines suffered economically from the Gulf War of 1991. Rising fuel costs from the war, as well as management and labor issues were contributing factors in Eastern's demise. Only two months after Eastern stopped flying in January 1991, Bar Harbor ceased flying as Eastern Express. Efforts by a small group of investors were made to purchase Bar Harbor's former Eastern Express assets prior to their liquidation but ultimately proved futile as they too were liquidated along with the remains of Eastern.\n\nBar Harbor's former northern routes continued to grow and develop operating as Continental Express, now under the Britt Airways operating certificate. By 1992, Continental Express gave up the original Bar Harbor route (Bar Harbor to Boston) to Colgan Air, as well as the Boston and LaGuardia hubs completely, consolidating East coast operations at Newark. Many of the former Bar Harbor and PBA cities (Bangor, Portland, Presque Isle, Burlington, Hartford, Manchester, Albany, Philadelphia, Hyannis) continued to operate with flights to Newark using ex-Bar Harbor ATR 42 aircraft.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the airline featured a rather simple, small yellow cheatline livery on otherwise all-white airplanes. Later, a bold livery of single red and blue stripes separated by large blue stars was adopted. As an Eastern Express carrier, Bar Harbor utilized a modified Eastern Airlines color scheme including a flared \"hockey stick\" livery on the tail.\n\nThe following are major incidents and accidents that occurred involving Bar Harbor aircraft. \n\n"}

{"id": "1794320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794320", "title": "Benefic planet", "text": "Benefic planet\n\nThe term ‘benefic’ is derived from the Greek term \"agathopoios\" which literally means “good-doer”. According to Ancient Greek culture, planets were believed to have influences and provide guidance to humans, as they lived their lives. The planet's nature determines if it is Benefic or not, based on whether it helps the affected areas, with money problems for example. A planet with negative attributes would be classified as Malefic, from the Greek term \"kakopoios\" which literally means “bad-doer”. Planets are naturally Malefic or Benefic, however, a planet can change because of the astrological signs they house. Changes are dependent upon, and specific to each individual person. Horoscopes and their Zodiac sign indicate the goal of the planet for each person, as to which will be Malefic and which will be Benefic. This system is also used in Vedic astrology.\n\nSome examples of Benefic planets are:\nA planet is deemed Malefic because it can interfere with the positive effects of a Benefic planet. A Malefic planet often cause delay, destruction and uncertainty. Some examples of Malefic planets include:\n\nVedic Astrology can be defined as the science explains in details the planetary movements and positions in respect to day and time. In existence for thousands of years, Vedic astrology is the same as Indian Vedic astrology. It has many things in common with Western astrology. There are twelve Zodiac signs present, which have the ability to influence your decisions, thus helping to determine your future. It also follows the movement of the planets as to whether you receive positive influence or negative influences through them, much like in Ancient Greek mythology. Vedic astrology was documented by the Maharishi (Wise Men) and appears throughout Hindu scripture.\n\nA big difference between Western and Vedic astrology is the existence of Rahu and Ketu. Western astrology is just the nine planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto (even though it is not longer considered a planet) along with The Moon and The Sun. Appearing in Vedic astrology, along with the same celestial objects in Western astrology, is Rahu and Ketu. Their existence, according to Hindu mythology, is a result of a demon being decapitated. Rahu (the head) became immortal while Ketu (the remaining body) was left as a mortal. They became enemies of the sun and the moon, and it is said that Rahu and Ketu swallowed up The Sun and The Moon, thus causing an eclipse. Rahu and Ketu are considered to be invisible planets but really represent the North lunar node (pole) and the South lunar node.\n\nThere are twelve signs in the Zodiac, each one belonging to certain Malefic and Benefic planet. Not only that, but some planets are neutral in the signs. The planets hold different meanings depending on your personal astrological signs. For example, someone could have Mars as a Benefic planet due to their Zodiac sign but someone else could have Mars as a Malefic planet due to their Zodiac sign.

{"id": "1794330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794330", "title": "Top Gear Rally", "text": "Top Gear Rally\n\nTop Gear Rally is a 1997 racing video game developed by Boss Game Studios and released for the Nintendo 64. A follow-up to Kemcos original \"Top Gear\" game, it features a championship mode where a single player must complete six seasons of two to four races, as well as a multiplayer mode where two players may compete against each other via a split-screen display. The game's tracks combine both road and off-road surfaces and can be played in different weather conditions, including night, fog, rain, and snow. Players may customize their car with different tire grips and adjust its suspension stiffness and steering sensitivity. An option that allows players to custom paint their cars is also included.\n\n\"Top Gear Rally\" was conceived after Boss created a non-interactive demonstration running on Silicon Graphics workstations that featured two- and four-wheel drive vehicles racing through different driving conditions. The game features a physics engine with a functioning suspension that reacts to a variety of challenging terrain. Although the cars featured in the game are fictitious, they were modeled after real vehicles. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the technical aspects of its graphics and its fluid yet challenging gameplay. Criticism was targeted at its weak sound effects and limited multiplayer mode. In 1999, the game was ported to Microsoft Windows as \"Boss Rally\".\n\n\"Top Gear Rally\" is a racing game where players must drive cars on tracks that combine both road and off-road surfaces. Tracks are relatively open and may include hidden shortcuts, and each of them can be played in sunny, nocturnal, foggy, rainy, or snowy conditions. Before starting a race, players can custom paint their car, select different tire grips, adjust the suspension stiffness and steering sensitivity, and choose either a manual or automatic transmission. The acceleration, top speed, drivetrain, and engine placement of each car are different. These factors, along with the road and weather conditions, affect the handling of each car significantly. For example, the engine placement often determines how a car lands after a jump, while four-wheel drive cars have more grip on gravel tracks. Although cars can be damaged, their performance is not affected.\n\nThe game comprises four gameplay modes: Championship, Arcade, Time Attack, and Practice. In Championship mode, a single player must complete six seasons of two to four races in different weather conditions, with each race requiring the player to overtake 19 opponents controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Points are awarded based on the rank the player finishes a race. If the required quantity is not met, the player will not be able to progress to the next season. As the player progresses through the Championship mode, new cars and tracks are unlocked. A total of nine cars and four tracks are included in the game, in addition to two bonus cars and a hidden track that can be unlocked by completing the game and finishing first in every race during the last season of the Championship mode. A mirror variant for each track can also be unlocked, which reverses curves left-to-right and right-to-left.\n\nThe Arcade, Time Attack, and Practice modes are single-race challenges on tracks that have been unlocked in the game's Championship mode. Arcade involves the player racing against an opponent while reaching designated checkpoints under a time limit, whereas Time Attack requires the player to race against a ghost car that represents their best time. In Practice mode, the player can freely drive a car on a track without opponents or time restrictions. Both the Arcade and Practice modes support up to two players. A horizontal split-screen display is used if two players compete against each other. The game features three driving perspectives for the player to choose from. These include an exterior and interior view with or without a rearview mirror. The game is compatible with both the Rumble Pak and Controller Pak. The latter is used to save custom paint jobs and the player's progress through the Championship mode.\n\n\"Top Gear Rally\" was developed by Boss Game Studios as a follow-up to Kemcos original \"Top Gear\" game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Development of the game started in July 1996, after the company created a non-interactive demonstration that featured two- and four-wheel drive vehicles racing through different driving conditions. The demonstration was enough to convince Nintendo of America that Boss could develop a game for the Nintendo 64 console. Although the demonstration was developed on Silicon Graphics workstations that were more powerful than the Nintendo 64 and included vehicles that were modeled in 15,000 polygons, Boss was confident that their finished game would be very similar, stating that technical aspects such as lighting effects could be ported easily. Although \"Sega Rally Championship\" was a major inspiration, the company considered \"Top Gear Rally\" a game that would feel and look very different.\n\nBoss spent between two and three months developing the programming tools for the game, including a physics engine with a functioning suspension that reacts to a variety of challenging terrain. According to lead designer Colin Gordon, \"The physics are very accurate, and the shocks, brakes, and handling are specific to each car. No car [drives] like another\". The tracks were designed in such a way as to ensure that the game's distance fog and scenery rendering were not apparent. A level editor, which would let players create their own tracks, and a Battle Mode similar to the combat-based races of \"Super Mario Kart\", were originally planned to be included in the game. The developers opted to limit the multiplayer mode to two players because simultaneous four-player racing would have forced them to compromise on either the draw distance or their target frame rate of 30 frames per second. Although Boss did not have licenses to use automobile manufacturing brands, the cars featured in the game were modeled after real vehicles such as the Ford Escort, the Toyota Celica, the Toyota Supra, and the Porsche 911. The soundtrack was composed by Barry Leitch and produced in 8-bit samples.\n\n\"Top Gear Rally\" was originally intended to be released in the first quarter of 1997. In January 1997, it was reported that nearly 50% of the game was complete. By May 1997, around 80% of the game was complete. \"Top Gear Rally\" was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta in June 1997, where attendees could play a demo. In North America, the game was published by Midway Games and released in October 1997. In Europe, \"Top Gear Rally\" was released in November 1997. The Japanese version, which was released on December 5, 1997, includes a built-in EEPROM in the Nintendo 64 Game Pak that allows players to save their progress without the need of a Controller Pak. It also includes a new title sequence and car models that were more popular in Japan, such as the F150 and the Mitsubishi Pajero.\n\n\"Top Gear Rally\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it superior to \"\"—another Nintendo 64 game that shares similar features. \"Next Generation\" described \"Top Gear Rally\" as \"a fabulous off-road racer with tons of bonus cars, courses, and replay value to make it a keeper\", stating that the game \"exceeds everything good \"Sega Rally\" came up with, then adds some twists of its own.\" \"Game Informer\" remarked that the game feels more natural than \"MRC\" and that its tracks are longer and more fun. In a less positive review, \"GameSpot\" felt that the game was too realistic and may frustrate players, but acknowledged that it \"demands respect for its graphics, physics, and track design.\" \"Edge\" concluded that \"Top Gear Rally\" \"certainly has its moments, but they are scattered too few and far between to create a continuously thrilling white-knuckle ride.\"\n\nThe game was widely praised for its clean and crisp graphics. \"GameSpot\" remarked that \"backgrounds and foregrounds seamlessly blend in an effect that's nearly photorealistic\" and that the game's high frame rate \"creates an impressive illusion of speed.\" Graphically, \"N64 Magazine\" stated that \"Top Gear Rally\" rivals most arcade games of the time, while \"GamePro\" noted details such as the reflective mud in the game's jungle track and the fact that cars can be damaged. However, some reviewers said that the game has a barren scenery and repeats textures frequently. The music and sound effects were considered weak, with \"Nintendo Power\" stating that the soundtrack does not suit the game's fast pace. Occasional glitches were found, including an instance of two cars overlapping when colliding side by side and the fact that players can get stuck on slanted roadsides, requiring them to restart the race.\n\nThe gameplay was highlighted for its fluidity and realistic feel. \"N64 Magazine\" noted the game's suspension physics, writing that \"Each wheel has a mind of its own, and jiggles up and down as it goes over bumps. Crest a hill too fast and the whole car will take off, the wheels dangling down until you land with a 'crump', the car then bouncing up and down for a while as the suspension settles down.\" Many critics agreed that, although the Championship mode starts off slow and the controls require some practice, the game gradually becomes more fun and challenging as players unlock more powerful cars. The track's length and varied weather conditions were also highlighted. The split-screen multiplayer mode was criticized because of its black area on the right side of the screen, which contains the game's HUD but leaves a relatively small portion of the screen for players to observe their surroundings. The fact that both players cannot race against computer-controlled opponents was also criticized.\n\n\"Top Gear Rally\" was ported by Boss to Microsoft Windows in 1999. Because Kemco owns the \"Top Gear\" license, Boss had to released it as \"Boss Rally\". Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, \"Boss Rally\" features three more cars and an additional track, and comprises three gameplay modes: Championship, Time Attack, and Quick Race. Both the Championship and Time Attack modes are similar to those from \"Top Gear Rally\", whereas Quick Race is a single-race challenge where the player must race against a computer-controlled opponent. A multiplayer mode that supports up to eight players is also included.\n"}

{"id": "1794366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794366", "title": "The Execution of Lady Jane Grey", "text": "The Execution of Lady Jane Grey\n\nThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey is an oil painting by Paul Delaroche, completed in 1833, which is now in the National Gallery in London (until 27 January 2019, on loan to an exhibition in the Houston Museum of Fine Arts). It was enormously popular in the decades after it was painted, but in the 20th century realist historical paintings fell from critical favour and it was kept in storage for many decades, for much of which it was thought lost. Restored and displayed again since 1975, it immediately once again became a highly popular work, especially with younger visitors.\n\nThe painting portrays, erroneously in some regards, the moments preceding the death of Lady Jane Grey, who on 10 July 1553 was proclaimed Queen of England, only to be deposed nine days later and executed in 1554. Jane is sometimes referred to as the \"Nine Days' Queen\" due to the brevity of her reign.\n\nLady Jane Grey was the great-granddaughter of Henry VII of England and first cousin once removed to his grandson, the short-lived Edward VI. After Edward's death she was proclaimed queen, being given precedence over Henry VIII's daughters, Mary Tudor and Elizabeth. Two weeks after the death of her brother, Mary, who had the support of the English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished, having reigned for only nine days. Jane, her husband Lord Guilford Dudley, and her father, were imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of high treason. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but the death penalty handed to her was temporarily suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father, who had been released, was one of the rebel leaders in Wyatt's rebellion. On Friday 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband beheaded. Her father followed two days later.\n\nDelaroche painted the subject of Lady Jane's execution in 1833, nearly 300 years after the event, drawing upon contemporary historical sources to help him portray it accurately. Delaroche had built his reputation in the Paris salon with large, realistic portrayals of famous events from the previous few centuries. Despite the artist's familiarity with the painting of historical narratives, there are aspects of the painting which are inaccurate.\nThe painting depicts the moment that Jane, blindfolded, is being assisted to lay her head upon the block for the executioner. Her outstretched hand reaches uncertainly down to find the block. She is being assisted by a man who is identified as John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos. Chandos was a Lieutenant of the Tower at the time of Jane's execution. While imprisoned in the Tower, Jane was attended by ladies in waiting, one of whom was the nursemaid of her infancy. Two ladies in waiting are depicted in the painting, showing their grief at the event which is about to take place.\n\nThe execution actually was conducted in the open air, in a part of the grounds of the Tower of London that is known as Tower Green, and where Henry VIII's wives Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard had been executed. The painting indicates either that Delaroche was not familiar with this aspect of the event and has constructed the location according to his historical knowledge of other such events, or that he chose to take a great deal of artistic license.\n\nIn the picture, the execution is taking place upon a raised wooden platform similar to those on which executions of royalty and nobility had taken place in the French Revolution. The edge of this platform can be seen, draped with a black cloth, across the foreground of the picture. At the rear of the pictorial space the handrail of stairs descends, and the tops of two weapons indicate the presence of guards. Delaroche was presumably aware that the Tower of London was founded by William of Normandy. In the painting, two stout Norman columns with cushion capitals, a blind arcade, and a large chevroned arch create a backdrop indicative of the antiquity of the site. However, the buildings within the Tower of London span the reigns of many monarchs. In fact, the execution took place outside the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, which was constructed not at the time of William the Conqueror but by order of Henry VIII, and therefore in a style postdating that of the architecture in the painting by nearly 500 years.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain by the setting and the lighting whether it was the artist's intention to create the impression that the scene was taking place outside a building or in an interior. The architectural features shown can occur on both interiors and exteriors of Norman buildings. The darkness of the upper part of the painting is suggestive of an interior, while the light that bathes the central figure is daylight. Ghislaine Kenyon, Head of Education at the National Gallery, commented on the sense of foreboding that the darkness was intended to create.\n\nThe intensely dark areas that occupy a large proportion of the painting's surface play a big part in the drama. Not only is the shadow of the upper section of the painting black, so also are the cloth that covers the platform, the dress of one of the ladies, the cloak of Baron Chandos and the sleeves of the executioner. Three garments form accents of warm colour, the brown dress of one of the ladies, the orange fur of the Lieutenant's collar and the blood-red hose of the executioner. The colour of Lady Jane's red-gold hair is picked up in the straw beneath the block. Against the darkness, Lady Jane, with her pallid flesh, her white bodice and satin petticoat, makes a splash of light. The artist seizes the eye of the viewer by placing the most intense patches of white on Jane's blindfold and the area of her skirt just between her outstretched hand and the sharply defined edge of the block.\n\nDelaroche has used many small details in telling the story and increasing the dramatic and emotive quality of the painting. The figures play their parts like actors through the expressions and gestures of grief and despair of the two women, the almost fatherly tenderness with which the Lieutenant of the Tower assists the blindfolded girl to take up the required position and the displeasure in the face of the executioner at the task that confronts him. Other narrative details include the rings on the block with the ropes which lash it steady to the floor, and the well-honed but well-worn edge to the axe. Kenyon points out that the clean straw, commonly placed near the site of an execution to soak up blood, and the white dress were devices used by the artist to make the observer suppose what would happen to them next.\n\nThe painting was made after the July Revolution of 1830 which deposed Charles X of France, the last of the French Bourbon monarchs. Charles X's brother was Louis XVI of France whose throne was usurped and who was executed during the French Revolution. It is also redolent of the execution of Marie-Antoinette. Unsurprisingly, the emotive painting caused something of a sensation. The painting was highly popular in the Paris salon when it was first exhibited there in 1834.\n\nIt was originally bought by Anatole Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato as part of the Demidov collection. From there it passed in 1870 to Henry Eaton, 1st Baron Cheylesmore after whose death in 1891 it realised £1,575 (lot 78) at his sale at Christie's the next year, less than a quarter of the price of the star of the sale, \"The Monarch of the Glen\" (lot 42, £7,245) by Sir Edwin Landseer, one of the most popular paintings of the age. It was bought by his son, William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore, who bequeathed it to the National Gallery, London in 1902, with four other paintings, including two other Landseers from his father's collection.\n\nThe painting was thought to have been destroyed in the disastrous Tate Gallery flood of 1928 during the 1928 Thames flood, and was only rediscovered in 1973 by Tate Gallery curator Christopher Johnstone. He was writing a book on the British painter John Martin and going through the damaged canvases remaining from the flood in search of a missing painting by the artist. He found Martin's \"The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum\", albeit in very poor condition, rolled inside the Delaroche painting which was in perfect condition and transferred to the National Gallery where it should have gone when the national art collections were rationalised following the establishment of the Tate.

It began in 1921 as San Jose Seminary to which \"outsiders\" were later admitted. When the seminarians moved to a new facility the remaining school became an \"externado\". In 2015 Externado was ranked fourth among 440 schools in El Salvador by the University of El Salvador on the basis of test scores, and had a larger enrollment than the first three schools combined.\n\nIn 1921 the Jesuits founded San José School seminary school, in the center of San Salvador next to San José Church (later destroyed by fire). Later \"outsiders\" not contemplating the priesthood were admitted for baccalaureate studies. to the school, which included boarding and day students. Years later the seminarians moved to the new seminary of San José de la Montaña. Those remaining justified the name \"externs\" or San Jose Externado.\n\nIn the 1940s work began on a new school with more adequate facilities on the outskirts of San Salvador, the school's present location. Four Jesuit brothers from the Basque area of Spain did much of the construction at 25 North or \"Üniversity\" Avenue. The primary division moved there in 1954 and the secondary school in 1955. In 1963 the chapel of St. Ignatius of Loyola was built with a capacity for a thousand people. In 1956 the night school, Loyola Academy, was founded to tend to the needs of workers and employees. In 1972 an evening shift was added, to better serve the poor. In 1978, co-education was introduced.\n\nOn 10 October 10, 1986, the San Salvador earthquake critically damaged the three-story building, and it had to be demolished. While new facilities were being constructed the primary school met in the chapel and the Baccalaureate at Central American University (UCA). In 1988 the new and current facilities were opened, with financial help from Jesuits provinces outside El Salvador.\n\nSan Jose is academically selective; its students have ranked highest in the Learning and Academic Aptitude Test scores (PAES) since its inception in 1997. Externado San José was long considered a school for the elites, but after the Second Vatican Council and the Conference of Latin American Bishops at Medellin in the 1960s the Jesuits and staff determined to make education more accessible to the poor. They initiated a sliding scale for tuition, based on family income. No longer seen as elitist, the school nonetheless has maintained high admission and academic performance standards. For secondary students, low grades and/or demerits in personal conduct can lead to expulsion. At the same time, Christian Formation courses took on the goal of forming men and women devoted to serving their society. This included some elements of Liberation Theology which would bridge the deep social divide in El Salvador. At the time many upscale families withdrew their children from the school, and six Jesuits at their sister school UCA would become martyrs for their open opposition to the elitist government.\n\nExternado San José still operates with this system of differentiated quotas, and remains coeducational. Its graduates include many prominent Salvadoreans, among them former presidents Armando Calderón Sol and Mauricio Funes, and the internationally acclaimed poet Roque Dalton.\n\nThe last year of preschool and nine years of primary school meet from 7:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Besides usual subjects children receive classes in Christian formation, sports, music, crafts, English (from second grade), and chess (from third grade). This is followed by two years of Baccalaureate meeting from 7:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. From grade seven on, group work and creativity are promoted along with various forms of research, fostering development in the group and emotional maturity. These programs are supplemented by physical education, Christian training, computer skills, and study skills.\n\nThe Evening Shift covers grades 4 through 9, with a school day from 1:00 to 6:15 p.m. Many, but not all, students in this shift receive financial assistance according to their family's proven need.\n\nThe school campus occupies about 19 acres in the middle of San Salvador. It includes six blocks for classrooms plus laboratories for physics, chemistry, and biology, two computer rooms, two projection rooms, and rooms for music, crafts, and chess. The school library contains about 25,000 volumes and includes a separate reading room and group work room. St. Ignatius of Loyola Chapel seats a thousand people and Mary Queen of Peace Chapel holds fifty. There is an auditorium seating seven hundred people and another seating two hundred.\n\nSports facilities include a 25-meter swimming pool, soccer fields including one regulation and surrounded by a track, three volleyball courts, and three basketball courts.\nThe flowering staff in the upper left symbolizes Saint Joseph and several volcanoes in the upper right symbolize Jesuit work in the Central American Province. The lower left has the coat of arms of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, and the bottom right has the letters \"AMDG\" taken from the Latin for the Ignatian motto, \"To the greater glory of God.\" The parrot is the mascot of the school, usually portrayed by a cute rendering of a parakeet, a very common bird in Central America.\n\nIn line with the Jesuit objective of training men and women for others, throughout the year various activities are carried out such as coexistence, retreats, Christian formation classes, and community celebrations (Pentecost, Easter, Confirmations...). To encounter people who live in poverty and are marginalized in the country, regular visits are arranged to institutions for children, for young people, and for the elderly, people who are often at risk, abused, or deprived of their basic needs; this is followed by group reflection. The school is a part of the Ignatians for Haiti drive among Jesuit schools in Latin America.\n\nThe Department of Communications and Cultural Activities (DECOMACCU) offers three programs which run throughout the year. \"Periqueando\" newsletter is produced for elementary (K – 6) and \"Perquiting\" for secondary (7 – 11) students. Student activities of a cultural, athletic, pastoral, or social nature are covered. Festivals and cultural contests discover, promote, and reward the creative and artistic talents of students, through writing (composition, poetry, and narrative), speaking (oratory and declamation), and performing (music, drawing, theater, and dance). Their best literary efforts are published in \"Green Letter Anthology\", which can be viewed online. Occasionally cultural events are staged within the school, featuring prominent artistic groups.\n\nStudents in ninth grade through high school take physical education, which teaches swimming, basketball, volleyball, soccer, and fitness. Intramural tournaments are also conducted for students from first grade through high school, in soccer, swimming, volleyball, basketball, kickball, and track and field. The more skilled students compete at various levels in interscholastic sports in basketball, as well as in soccer and volleyball which also have national championships.\n"}

Founded on 12 March 1954, it is supported by, though independent of, the Indian government. Its office is located in Rabindra Bhavan near Mandi House in Delhi.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi organises national and regional workshops and seminars; provides research and travel grants to authors; publishes books and journals, including the Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature; and presents the annual Sahitya Akademi Award of Rs. 100,000 (approx. USD 1,500 (in year 2013)) in each of the 24 languages it supports, as well as the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Library is one of the largest multi-lingual libraries in India, with a rich collection of books on literature and allied subjects.\n\nIt publishes two bimonthly literary journals: \"Indian Literature\" in English and \"Samkaleen Bharatiya Sahitya\" in Hindi.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi supports work in the following languages:\n\n\nThe idea of constituting a National Academy of Letters in India was considered by the colonial British government, and in 1944 a proposal from the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal for the formation of a 'National Cultural Trust' was, in principle, accepted. The original plan conceived of three institutions, or academies, devoted to the visual arts, performing arts, and letters. The independent Government of India carried out this proposal, constituting a National Academy of Letters, called the 'Sahitya Akademi' by a government resolution on 15 December 1952.\n\nThe first General Council of the Akademi included members such as S. Radhakrishnan, Abul Kalam Azad, C. Rajagopalachari, K.M. Panikkar, K.M. Munshi, Zakir Hussain, Umashankar Joshi, Mahadevi Varma, D. V. Gundappa, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, and was presided over by the then-Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The Government of India clarified that the choice of Prime Minister Nehru as the first chairperson was \"not because he is Prime Minister, but because he has carved out for himself a distinctive place as a writer and author.\"\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954 in New Delhi. A ceremony was held in the Indian Parliament's Central Hall, with speeches by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and S. Radhakrishnan. S. Radhakrishnan elaborated on the purpose of the Sahitya Akademi in his speech, noting that,\n\"The phrase, Sahitya Akademi, combines two words. 'Sahitya' is Sanskrit, and 'Academy' is Greek. This name suggests our universal outlook and aspiration. Sahitya is a literary composition; Academy is an assembly of men who are interested in the subject. So Sahitya Akademi will be an assembly of all those who are interested in creative and critical literature. It is the purpose of this Akademi to recognise men of achievement in letters, to encourage men of promise in letters, to educate public taste and to improve standards of literature and literary criticism.\"\n\nA key concern in the early days of the Sahitya Akademi was the establishment of its autonomy from the Central Government. This concern was echoed by the Prime Minister, who noted that, \"...it is an honour to be the President of an organisation which includes it in its fold the eminent writers of India in various languages. As President of that Akademi I may tell you quite frankly, I would not like the Prime Minister to interfere in my work.\" The first Council made recommendations to amend the Akademi's governing constitution, including proposals to have the chairman elected by the Council and not appointed by the Government. Some of these suggestions were incorporated, and the Akademi was constituted as a society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860, as it had not originally been incorporated by an Act of Parliament, but by an executive order. The Council was reconstituted and elected Prime Minister Nehru as its president, and he continued in that capacity until his death in 1964.\n\nSubsequent presidents of the Sahitya Akademi have included S. Radhakrishnan (1958) who succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru after serving as the Vice-President along with him; Zakir Hussain (1963); Suniti Kumar Chatterjee (1967); K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar (1969, and re-elected in 1973); Umashankar Joshi (1978); Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya (1983); U. R. Ananthamurthy (1993); Ramakanta Rath (1998); and Gopi Chand Narang (2003). Sunil Gangopadhyay was elected president in 2008, and held office until his death in 2012. The current president is Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari. The Akademi has never elected a female president although, in 2003, Mahasweta Devi unsuccessfully contested Gopi Chand Narang for the position.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi was constituted by the Government of India by a resolution passed on 15 December 1952. It was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954. It initially functioned under executive order, but was subsequently registered as a society under the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860. The constitution of the Sahitya Akademi provides that it shall be run by three authorities — a General Council, an Executive Board, and a Finance Committee.\n\nThe General Council is empowered to elect a president and vice-president, from a panel of three candidates chosen by the Executive Board. In addition to these, the Executive Board appoints a secretary, who functions as both the Secretary of the Akademi and as ex-officio secretary of all three governing bodies.\n\nThe General Council of the Sahitya Akademi operates for a term of five years, following which it is reconstituted. It meets once a year and performs several important functions, including appointing the Akademi's president and vice-president, electing members of the Executive Board, framing rules and procedures for the Akademi, and electing fellows on the recommendation of the Board.\n\nThe General Council consists of the following members: \n\nThe Executive Board of the Sahitya Akademi exercises executive authority and is responsible for supervising and controlling the Akademi's work. It prepares the Akademi's annual budget, appoints the secretary, and prepares panels of nominees for the General Council to consider and select fellows. It consists of the president, the vice-president, the financial advisor, two of the Government of India's nominees in the General Council (one of whom must represent the Ministry of Culture) and one person to represent each of the Akademi's supported languages, as nominated by the General Council.\n\nThe Finance Committee's role is to prescribe the limit for total expenditure by the Sahitya Akademi in a financial year, and consider and recommend budget estimates to the Executive Board. The Finance Committee consists of a financial advisor, a nominee from the Government of India, a representative each from the General Council and Executive Board, and the vice-president of the Akademi. The accounts of the Sahitya Akademi are audited by the Auditor General of India.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi publishes several regular publications, in addition to its bi-monthly journal, \"Indian Literature\". It undertakes bibliographic surveys, conducts translation workshops, seminars, and an annual festival of letters.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi publishes bibliographies, compilations, and critical editions in addition to publishing individual works and anthologies of literature and translation in the 24 languages that it supports. Amongst other things, it publishes the National Bibliography of Indian Literature (NBIL), an ongoing selective index of publications in 24 languages. The first series of the NBIL consisted of four volumes, spanning literature published between 1901 and 1953. The Sahitya Akademi has stated that the second series will cover literature published between 1954 and 2000. The second series will consist of 16 volumes, of which seven have been published. In addition, the Sahitya Akademi has published the \"Collected Works of Maulana Azad\" in Urdu and Telugu, and critical editions of books by Kalidasa, Bankimchandra Chatterjee, and Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi maintains reference materials for Indian literature, including the National Register of Translators, the Who's Who of Indian Writers, and the Who's Who of Sanskrit literature. Two ongoing series of reference material are the \"Makers of Indian Literature\", which consist of biographical monographs on Indian writers, and \"Histories of Indian Literature\", 18 of which have been published thus far. It publish two journal: \"Indian Literature\" (started in 1957) in English, and \"Samakaleen Bharatiya Sahitya\" (started in 1980) in Hindi.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi holds over 100 programmes related to Indian literature every year across India. It holds frequent seminars on Indian literature, as well as translation workshops. In addition, it holds several regular and annual events, including a Festival of Letters and the Samvatsar Annual Lecture.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi periodically holds International Seminars, sometimes in collaboration with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. The first international seminar was held in 1961, in New Delhi, to mark 100 years since the birth of Rabindranath Tagore. About 25 writers from 16 countries, along with 39 writers from India met over four days to discuss and commemorate Tagore's works. Attendees included Aldous Huxley, Martin Wickremesinghe, Jean Guehenno, Zaki Naguib Mahmoud, Isaiah Berlin, and Louis Untermeyer as well as Amrita Pritam, Ramdhari Sinha Dinkar, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, and Premendra Mitra. In 1991, the Akademi organised a second International Seminar on Tagore in collaboration with the Sangeet Natak Akademi, the Lalit Kala Akademi and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.\n\nThe Akademi's second International Seminar in 1975 was also held in New Delhi and focused on the Ramayana tradition in Asia. Participants, including U Thein Han, Soewito Santoso, Harry M. Buck, C.E. Godakumbra, Kapila Vatsyayan, Camille Bulke and Umashankar Joshi, presented 44 papers on Ramayana traditions, which were published by the Akademi in a commemorative volume. A second International seminar on the same theme was held in New Delhi in 1981.\n\nInternational Seminars have since been held to mark the birth centenary of Hindi-language writer Premchand, in 1981; to mark the birth centenary of Tamil-language poet Subramania Bharti in 1983; on the Mahabharata, in 1987; and on 'the Narrative' in 1990.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters is held in February and is the occasion at which the Akademi presents its awards. The festival is accompanied by an exhibition that covers major literary events of the previous year, as well as a 'Writers' Meet' which is a literary seminar spanning three days.\n\nThe Samvatsar Annual Lecture is organised by the Sahitya Akademi and is delivered during the Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters. The Sahitya Akademi notes that these lectures \"should open up new vistas of thinking regarding a literary movement, a current literary trend, some original thinking about a great writer or a great classic or a new path in literary criticism or literary creation\". The Lectures have been delivered since 1986 by people including the Hindi writer Sachchidananda Vatsyayan (1986), Marathi poet and writer Vinda Karandikar (1991), Assamese novelist Nabakanta Barua (1994), and Malayalam author and director, M T Vasudevan Nair (1999).\n\nIn 2014, the lecture was delivered by Girish Karnad, a Kannada playwright and author. The most recent lecture was delivered by Dr. Chandrashekhar Shankar Dharmadhikari, an author, lawyer, and former judge in the Bombay High Court on 17 February 2016.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi organises regular public interactions with published Indian authors. These sessions, titled 'Meet the Author' consist of a 40-minute lecture by the invited author followed by an open session of questions and discussions. 'Meet the Author' programmes have been conducted in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bengaluru. Over 180 authors have participated to date.\n\nTo complement this, the Sahitya Akademi has held a parallel lecture series titled 'Men in Books' in which the Akademi invites persons distinguished for interdisciplinary studies to speak about literature. Notable speakers in the past have included film-maker Adoor Gopalakrishnan, journalist Dilip Padgaonkar, lawyer Laxmi Mall Singhvi, and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nThe Kavi Anuvadak programmes, started in 2001, consist of a live performance of poetry in the original language and in translation. Nine Kavi Anuvadaks have been held to date, featuring, amongst others, K. Satchidanandan, Manglesh Dabral, and Ayyappa Paniker.\n\nSahitya Akademi Award (Devnagari: साहित्य अकादमी पुरस्कार) is a literary honor in India which Sahitya Akademi annually confers on writers of the most outstanding books of literary merit published in any of the major Indian languages recognised by the Akademi.\n\nSahitya Akademi conferres annually the Yuva Puraskar to young writers (under 35 years) of outstanding works in one of the 24 major Indian languages. It was founded in 2011.\n\nOther programmes organised by the Sahitya Akademi include the Mulakat lectures, a special platform for lesser-known authors; the Through My Window lectures, in which one author speaks on the works of another Indian author; and the Loka programmes on Indian folklore and the Kavisandhi poetry readings.\n\nThere have been widespread allegations of corruption and controversial appointments under the Presidency of Gopi Chand Narang who headed Sahitya Akademi from 2003 to 2007 and the President Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari. Agrahara Krishnamurthy, appointed as the Secretary of Sahitya Akademi by Narang, had undergone a CBI probe in a paper purchase scam at the time of his appointment, and was censured and forced to retire after being accused of financial irregularities in 2012. Agrahara Krishnamurthy who has been granted relief by the High Court has alleged a conspiracy against him by a cabal of writers and officials. The appointment by a committee composed of Narang, Tiwari and others of the current Secretary K. Sreenivasa Rao, is controversial as Rao's academic credentials for the top job, who had joined the Akademi as a lower division clerk (LDC), are said to be insufficient and extremely dubious.\n\nThe 171st Parliamentary Standing Committee on the functioning of Sahitya Akademi and three other institutions chaired by Sitaram Yechury and tabled at the Lok Sabha in August 2011 states, \"It was felt that most of these institutions were not able to live up to the original mandates set out by their founding fathers. Controversies of different kind involving these institutions that keep cropping up from time to time, had caught this Committee’s attention. Questions were also raised about the indifference and helplessness shown by the Ministry of Culture to do anything in the face of autonomy enjoyed by these institutions.\"\n\nThe Committee also urged Sahitya Akademi to adopt the recommendation of the Haksar Committee (1988) of having its head appointed by the President of India, a practice followed by Sangeet Natak and Lalit Kala Akademies, to avoid \"the inevitable complications of the existing system of elections.\"\n\nMany controversial appointments of unqualified candidates to key positions at the Sahitya Akademi, done during Gopi Chand Narang's time, continue unchallenged to this day. Khurshid Alam and Mrignayani Gupta, both dismissed in 2004 for presenting counterfeit degree certificates, have made a backdoor entry and have been subsequently promoted to higher positions. There have been widespread allegations in the Hindi press that the certificates of the current secretary, K. Sreenivasa Rao, who completed his M.Phil and PhD degrees while being employed as Deputy Secretary (Administration) at the Sahitya Akademi without availing a single day's leave, are fake and fraudulent. Appeals by the writers community to the Ministry of Culture to launch an inquiry have not yielded any result.\n\nIt has been alleged time and again that the procedure of nomination of litterateurs for the coveted Sahitya Akademi Awards is not transparent. The ground-list of books (from which the jury members make two short-lists and the final selection for the award) is supposed to be made by the General Council. But the books are provided to this council by the bureaucrats and employees of the Akademi who are allegedly unqualified to make any kind of literary selection. Though the award regulations makes the recommendations of the Language Advisory Board mandatory, the recommendations of the board are often dismissed and ignored by the officials without citing any reason. This lack of transparency and rigour in the selection process has resulted in a lot of controversy. It has even resulted in writers being forced to return the award when it has been proven that the selection procedure was fraudulent, as was the case with the Sahitya Akademi award for a translation into Odia in 1999.\n\nSahitya Akademi is also highly criticized by writers such as Khushwant Singh for ignoring eminent writers and awarding below-par writers and sub-standard literary works.\n\nOn the occasion of its Golden Jubilee, the Akademi awarded the following prizes for outstanding works of poetry in translation from Indian languages.\n\n\nThe Golden Jubilee Prizes for Life Time Achievement were awarded to Namdeo Dhasal, Ranjit Hoskote, Neelakshi Singh, Abdul Rasheed and Sithara S.\n\n\n"}

He was the first manager of Celtic Football Club, and one of the most successful managers in Scottish football history. During his managerial tenure, Maley led Celtic to thirty major trophies (16 league championships and 14 Scottish Cups) in forty-three consecutive years as manager.\n\nMaley was born in Newry Barracks, County Down, Northern Ireland, the third son of Thomas Maley and Mary Montgomery. Thomas came from Ennis, County Clare, while Mary had been born in Canada to Scottish parents. At the time of his son's birth, Thomas was stationed in Newry as a sergeant in the 21st (Royal North British Fusilier) Regiment of Foot. In 1869, Thomas took honourable discharge from the British Army and the family moved to Scotland, settling in Cathcart - at that time a village just south of Glasgow.\n\nWillie Maley left school at the age of 13 and worked for a few years in the printworks of Miller, Higginbotham & Co., and then at the Telephone Company of Glasgow. Eventually he was offered the opportunity to train as a chartered accountant with Smith and Wilson, a Glasgow accountancy firm. As a young man, Maley was much more involved in athletics than in football, although he had played a few games for Cathcart Hazelbank Juniors in 1886 and had played with Third Lanark from later that year.\n\nIt was on a visit to in Cathcart in December 1887 to invite his brother Tom Maley to join Celtic that Brother Walfrid and the rest of the Celtic deputation first met Willie Maley and they casually invited Willie to come along. In 1888, he was signed by the fledgling Celtic and became one of the club's first players as a midfielder. In 1896, he made a single appearance for Manchester City in a Second Division match against Loughborough.\n\nDue to his Scottish maternal grandparents and having lived in Scotland since the age of one, Maley played for the Scottish national team, earning two caps in 1893 against England and Ireland. Maley represented the Scottish League twice.\n\nIn 1897, the board of Celtic directors appointed Willie Maley, at just 29 years of age, as Secretary-Manager – the first manager – of Celtic. He won the Scottish League championship for the club in his first full season as manager. Mr Maley never worked with his players in training, he watched games from the directors' box and never indulged in team talks or spoke to his players at half-time or post-match. Maley would not even announce the team: players learned if they were in or out through reading the line-up in the newspaper.\n\nCeltic had been a buying club in their opening decade, spending heavily to bring professionals to the club. Maley decided to scrap that and rely almost entirely on recruiting youngsters fresh from junior football.\n\nMaley created a young team who won six consecutive league titles in a row between 1905 and 1910 and won the first Scottish League and Scottish Cup doubles. They were the best team in Glasgow, and the six-in-a-row record remained unbroken until the 1960s. As his six-in-a-row team began to age, Maley set about the task of building a younger team. This younger side, which included Patsy Gallacher and the apparently 'ageless' Jimmy McMenemy, won four league titles in succession between 1914 and 1917. They also set a UK record for an unbeaten run in professional football, 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn) from 13 November 1915 until 21 April 1917, which stood until it was broken by Brendan Rodgers' Celtic in November 2017.\n\nThat side won two more titles, in 1919 and 1922. Celtic continued to gather trophies throughout the 1920s and in the mid-1930s Maley built his third great team, featuring Jimmy Delaney and Jimmy McGrory. This side won the league title in 1936 and 1938 and the Scottish Cup in 1937. By then, Maley was approaching 70. The Maley years ended in a less than happy fashion. With Celtic at the bottom of the table, Maley finally retired after a meeting with the board of directors in February 1940. He was the longest-serving manager in Celtic's history. In his 43 years as manager, he won 16 Scottish League championships, 14 Scottish Cups, 14 Glasgow Cups and 19 Glasgow Charity Cups.\n\nHis Celtic career is detailed in the song \"Willie Maley\", written by David Cameron, one of the most popular Celtic songs amongst fans. The song was unheard of until Cameron gave it to Charlie and the Bhoys, who rewrote some of the lyrics and made the song what it is today.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794389", "title": "Rajasthani language", "text": "Rajasthani language\n\nRajasthani (Devanagari: ) refers to a group of Indo-Aryan languages and dialects spoken primarily in the state of Rajasthan\nand adjacent areas of Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in India. There are also Rajasthani-speakers in the Pakistani provinces of Sindh and Punjab. The Rajasthani language is distinct from neighbouring related Hindi languages as it is a western Indo-Aryan language.\n\nRajasthani has a literary tradition going back approximately 1500 years. The ancient astronomer and mathematician Brahmagupta of Bhinmal composed the \"Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta\". In 779 AD, Udhyotan Suri wrote the Kuvalaya Mala partly in Prakrit and partly in Apabhraṃśa. Maru-Gurjar or Maruwani or Gujjar Bhakha (1100–1500 AD), ancestor of Gujarati and Rajasthani, was spoken by the Gurjars in Gujarat and Rajasthan. Texts of this era display characteristic Gujarati features such as direct/oblique noun forms, post-positions, and auxiliary verbs. It had three genders as Gujarati does today. During the medieval period, the literary language split away from Gujarati.\n\nBy around 1300 CE a fairly standardised form of this language emerged. While generally known as Old Gujarati, some scholars prefer the name of Old Western Rajasthani, based on the argument that Gujarati and Rajasthani were not distinct at the time. Also factoring into this preference was the belief that modern Rajasthani sporadically expressed a neuter gender, based on the incorrect conclusion that the [ũ] that came to be pronounced in some areas for masculine [o] after a nasal consonant was analogous to Gujarati's neuter [ũ]. A formal grammar of the precursor to this language was written by Jain monk and eminent scholar Hemachandra Suri in the reign of Solanki king Jayasimha Siddharaja. Maharana Kumbha wrote \"Sangeet Raj\", a book on musicology and a treatise on Jai Deva’s Geet Govinda.\n\nThe Rajasthani languages belong to the Western Indo-Aryan language family. However, they are controversially conflated with the Hindi languages of the Central-Zone in the Indian national census, among other places. The varieties of the Rajasthani language are:\n\n\nMost of the Rajasthani languages are chiefly spoken in the state of Rajasthan but are also spoken in Gujarat, Haryana and Punjab. Rajasthani languages are also spoken in the Bahawalpur and Multan sectors of the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Tharparkar district of Sindh. It merges with Riasti and Saraiki in Bahawalpur and Multan areas, respectively. It comes in contact with Sindhi from Dera Rahim Yar Khan through Sukkur and Ummerkot. This language is common in many areas of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Many linguists (Shackle, 1976 and Gusain, 2000) agree that it shares many phonological (implosives), morphological (future tense marker and negation) and syntactic features with Riasti and Saraiki. A distribution of the geographical area can be found in 'Linguistic Survey of India' by George A. Grierson.\n\nToday, both India's National Academy of Letters, the Sahitya Akademi, and its University Grants Commission recognize Rajasthani as a distinct language, and it is taught as such in both Jodhpur's Jai Narain Vyas University and Udaipur's Mohanlal Sukhadia University. The state Board of Secondary Education included Rajasthani in its course of studies, and it has been an optional subject since 1973. National recognition has lagged, however.\n\nIn 2003, the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly passed a unanimous resolution to insert recognition of Rajasthani into the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. In May 2015, a senior member of the pressure group Rajasthani Bhasha Manyata Samiti, said at a New Delhi press conference: “Twelve years have passed, but there has absolutely been no forward movement.”\n\nAll 25 Members of Parliament elected from Rajasthan state, as well as Rajasthan's Chief Minister, Vasundhara Raje Scindia, have also voiced support for official recognition of the language.\n\nIn India, Rajasthani is written in the Devanagari script, an abugida which is written from left to right. Earlier, the Mahajani script, or Muriya, was used to write Rajasthani. In Pakistan, where Rajasthani is considered a minor language, a variant of the Sindhi script is used to write Rajasthani dialects.\n\nIn common with most other Indo-Iranian languages, the basic sentence typology is subject–object–verb. On a lexical level, Rajasthani has perhaps a 50 to 65 percent overlap with Hindi, based on a comparison of a 210-word Swadesh list. Most pronouns and interrogative words differ from Hindi, but the language does have several regular correspondences with, and phonetic transformations from, Hindi. The /s/ in Hindi is often realized as /h/ in Rajasthani — for example, the word ‘gold’ is /sona/ (सोना) in Hindi and /hono/ (होनो) in the Marwari dialect of Rajasthani. Furthermore, there are a number of vowel substitutions, and the Hindi /l/ sound (ल) is often realized in Rajasthani as a retroflex lateral /ɭ/ (ळ).\n\nRajasthani has 10 vowels and 31 consonants. The Rajasthani language Bagri has developed three lexical tones: low, mid and high.\n\nRajasthani has two numbers and two genders with three cases. Postpositions are of two categories, inflexional and derivational. Derivational postpositions are mostly omitted in actual discourse.\n\n\nLinguists and their work and year: [Note: Works concerned only with linguistics, not with literature]\n\n\n"}

It is a common species of Europe and adjacent regions (Near East and the Maghreb). While it is found widely throughout Scandinavian countries, which have a maritime climate, it is absent from parts of the former USSR which are at the same latitude but have a more continental climate.\n\nUp to four subspecies are listed by some authors, while others consider the willow beauty a monotypic species or accept only \"rhomboidaria\" and \"sublutearia\" as distinct:\n\nUnder its junior synonym \"Geometra rhomboidaria\", the willow beauty is the type species of its genus \"Peribatodes\". This was initially proposed as a subgenus of \"Boarmia\" but eventually elevated to full genus rank.\n\nThe adult's wingspan is 40–48 mm. The wings of this species are whitish-grey or -yellowish, though they have a buff or grey appearance from a distance, as they are heavily speckled with brown or black dots. Running over the fore- and hindwings in a semicircle are the two blackish bands commonly found in Ennominae, but they are broken and somewhat indistinct in this species. A tell-tale characteristic is a single bulge in the forewing part of the outer blackish bands. Melanic forms (e.g. \"rebeli\") sometimes occur. The sexes can be distinguished by their antennae, which are strongly feathered in the male, but almost smooth in the female.\n\nThis moth inhabits woodland, gardens and similar habitat. Either one or two generations occur each year, depending on locality. The adults are on the wing during summer – e.g. June to September on the British Isles, while in the more continental climate of Austria they are rarely seen anymore in late August. They fly at night and are attracted to light.\n\nThe caterpillar larva is reddish-brown and feeds on a variety of trees and shrubs, but – despite its name – rarely or never on willows (\"Salix\"). The species overwinters as a small larva. As evidenced by the species distribution, it does not seem to tolerate severe and dry winters very well.\n\nWillow beauty larvae are highly polyphagous and not adapted to a specific lineage of foodplants.

He dropped the \"John\" for most of his professional career. After graduating Harvard in 1900, he established himself as a music critic, writing for the New York Globe, New York Mail and finally New York World-Telegram. As a poet he was published in \"Trend\", for which he served as an editorial staffer beginning in 1914. As a novelist, his 1929 novel \"Prima Donna\" was called by one New York Times critic “an amazing achievement; nothing quite like it has been done in this country before.” He went on to put Sanborn in the same league with Willa Cather, Edith Wharton and Thornton Wilder. Sanborn was remarked upon as one of the great originals of 1920s-1930s culture. Sanborn's wealth of connections in intellectual and cultural circles included Van Wyck Brooks, Rosa Ponselle, Mark Van Doren and Llewelyn Jones. His friendship with Wallace Stevens (whom he met at Harvard) included a great influence upon Stevens’ interest in music and thus his poetry. He was a good friend and sometimes lover of Carl Van Vechten, who he convinced to assume editorship of \"Trend\". He was also a radio commentator for the Philadelphia Orchestra. Sanborn died at 61 of an apparent heart attack in his Greenwich Village apartment a few hours after he had attended a performance at the Metropolitan Opera House. He had just completed the first paragraph of his review. \n\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "1794449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794449", "title": "George Dern", "text": "George Dern\n\nGeorge Henry Dern (September 8, 1872 – August 27, 1936) was an American politician, mining man, and businessman. He is probably best remembered for co-inventing the Holt–Dern ore roasting process, as well as for his tenure as United States Secretary of War from 1933 to his death in 1936. He also served as the sixth Governor of Utah for eight years, from 1925 to 1933. Dern was a progressive politician who fought for tax reform, public education, and social welfare. He was an exceptional public speaker, able to captivate and entertain his audience, whether they were Progressives, Democrats, or Republicans.\n\nGeorge Henry Dern was born in Dodge County, Nebraska on September 8, 1872. He was the son of John Dern, a pioneering Nebraska farmer, mine operator, and industrialist, and Elizabeth, whose maiden name was the same as her married name, Dern. His parents were German immigrants. John was president of the Mercur Gold Mining and Milling Company and no doubt had a profound influence on George, who would follow in his father's footsteps when he entered the mining business. Dern graduated from Nebraska's Fremont Normal College of Midland University in 1888 and from 1893 to 1894 attended the University of Nebraska. Dern was also a talented athlete, serving as the University's football captain during that time. In 1894 he accompanied his family to Salt Lake City, joining the Mercur Gold Mining and Milling Company, which his father served as president. Rising rapidly from bookkeeper to company treasurer, he was promoted in 1901 to general manager of the company, which had been reorganized as the Consolidated Mercur Gold Mines Company. Dern was co-inventor of the Holt-Dern roaster, a furnace for carrying out the Holt-Christenson roasting process, a technique for recovering silver from low-grade ores. Mercur Gold Mining and Milling shut down in 1913, however Dern's experience and passion for mining would be reflected later on in his political career. On June 7, 1899, in Fremont, Dodge County, Nebraska, he married Charlotte \"Lottie\" Brown and had six living children altogether: (Mary J. (1902), John H.(1904), William B. (1907-1947), Margaret (1909), Elizabeth (1914-1941), and James G. (12/27/1915 to 12/10/78), Margaret died as a child, Betsy and Jimmy were not married at the time of George's death in 1936. Lottie died on September 5, 1952 in Chicago, and is buried next to her husband in Mt. Olivet Cemetery, Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nDern entered politics in 1914, running on a Democratic and Progressive fusion ticket in a Utah state senate district encompassing Salt Lake County. He was elected in 1914, serving until 1923 in the state senate, where he was twice selected as Democratic floor leader. His tenure there was marked by strong advocacy of progressive legislation, including a landmark mineral leasing act that leased, rather than sold, Utah's mineral rights to private concerns. Dern gained the Democratic nomination for governor in 1924, and during the campaign he received backing from the Utah Progressive Party and an endorsement from Progressive presidential candidate Robert La Follette. Challenging incumbent Republican governor Charles R. Mabey, Dern ran on the catchy slogan \"We want a Dern good governor, and we don't mean Mabey.\" Since Mabey's election in 1920, Utah had leaned Republican and continued to do so throughout Dern's terms as governor. However, Dern led a swing to Democratic control of the state which began in 1933 and continued for nearly 20 years.\n\nAs governor, Dern focused on using Utah's rich natural resources to develop the state economy and devoted himself to education, social welfare, and tax reform, thus further embroidering his reputation as a progressive. Arguing that the general property tax was unfair as the sole source of state revenue, Dern secured the adoption of a state income tax and a corporate franchise tax against strong opposition. He also took a leading role in resolving important interstate problems related to the building of the Boulder Dam on the Colorado River. Dern, whose state had the disadvantage of being upstream from the dam, staunchly defended the theory that, with the exception of navigation, the waters of western streams were state rather than federal resources. This controversy brought him into direct conflict with U.S. secretary of commerce Herbert Hoover, who was attempting to mediate the dispute for the Calvin Coolidge administration.\n\nIn yet another demonstration of Dern's appeal to Republican voters, Dern was reelected governor in 1928 by a landslide 31,000 votes despite the fact that Utah voted for the Republican National ticket by a margin of 14,000 votes. He subsequently served from 1929 to 1930 as chair of the National Governors' Conference, where he worked with New York governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. Dern's record as a progressive western governor also commended him to Roosevelt, who after the November 1932 election to the presidency appointed Dern as his Secretary of War.\n\nRoosevelt initially wanted Dern for the post of Secretary of the Interior but settled on appointing him to the War Department. Although he had no military experience and was reputed to have pacifist leanings, Dern won the support of military circles by promoting greater efficiency and readiness, calling for a military structure that could be expanded quickly and easily in a crisis. Dern initiated a five-year plan to equip the army with newer airplanes, more tanks, semiautomatic rifles, and modernized artillery. He advocated increased strength for the army Air Corps and investigated charges of lobbying in the War Department, resulting in the court-martial and dismissal of two high-ranking army officers who were found guilty of lobbying. These reforms won him the support and admiration of most military leaders.\n\nDuring Dern's tenure the War Department oversaw the administration of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Dern's department provided the CCC with food, clothing, transportation, and medical care for 300,000 unemployed who joined its ranks for work in the preservation and conservation of America's public lands. The army's Corps of Engineers began several important public works projects during Dern's tenure, including the dredging of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, the construction of the Florida ship canal. Under the aegis of the PWA, the Corps also built such projects as the Bonneville and Fort Peck dams; and began the aborted \"Quoddy\" Dam project. Dern worked closely with army chief of staff Douglas MacArthur on such projects. Dern was often at odds with President Roosevelt over plans to coordinate water resource development, and in\n1935 and 1936 he opposed legislation to establish a permanent National Resources Board, even though it was strongly supported by the New Deal administration. While still serving as Secretary of War, Dern died in Washington, D.C., from heart and kidney complications following a bout of influenza.\n\nDern was fond of outdoor sports such as fishing and hiking and is remembered as a hard-working member of the Roosevelt cabinet, one who could also be an entertaining public speaker. Ultimately, George Dern served as Secretary of War during a rather inconsequential time period for that position. The country was in the midst of the Great Depression, and due to the financial crisis, had adopted an isolationist approach toward foreign policy. After years of tight military budgets and an isolationist foreign policy, the War Department was a relatively inconsequential post during Dern's tenure. While he was generally well liked by other members of the cabinet, he never played a decisive role in the determination of administration policies. This is why Dern's political career is less documented than someone who served in his same position during a time of war.\n\nHis wife was Charlotte \"Lottie\" Brown (the daughter of William Steele Brown and Ida Belle Martin); the couple had seven children. He was grandfather of Academy Award-nominated actor Bruce Dern, and the great-grandfather of Academy Award-winning actress Laura Dern.\n\nBibliography\n"}

He won 69 caps for England and 5 for the British and Irish Lions.\n\nGrewcock was born in Coventry and attended Templars Primary School in Tile Hill then the secondary in Eastern Green Woodlands School, Coventry, leaving school in 1989. His rugby career started with Barkers Butts and Coventry and he played for the Warwickshire U21 side at age 19.\n\nHe is a graduate of Manchester Metropolitan University.\n\nIn 1996–97 he moved into the professional ranks with Coventry. It was Coventry's most successful period of the modern era, coming within touching distance of the Premiership. Along the way, with Grewcock an ever-present, they beat a Newcastle Falcons side featuring 15 internationals by 19-18 at Coundon Road. They eventually finished third to Newcastle and champions Richmond, and lost a promotion play-off against London Irish despite taking a narrow first leg advantage to Sunbury. Despite their second-tier status, both Grewcock and team mate Rob Hardwick were capped by England in this era.\n\nGrewcok's first cap for England came in the 1997 tour to Argentina, scoring his first international try in the test in Buenos Aires. He was sent off during England's 1998 trip to New Zealand. He joined Saracens later that summer but switched to Bath for the 2001–02 season.\n\nHe played in all three Test matches for the British and Irish Lions against Australia and in six of the ten tour matches overall. \n\nHe was only able to make one appearance during the 2003 World Cup after a toe injury, and breaking a hand in England's match against Uruguay. He was replaced in the squad by Simon Shaw. He received a World Cup winner's medal in December 2004.\n\nGrewcock returned to domestic rugby with Bath and produced some outstanding rugby, which led to his international recall as the successor for Martin Johnson in the Six Nations. He started in all three Autumn 2004 tests.\n\nHe was selected for the 2005 Lions tour to New Zealand. He was suspended for two months after being found guilty of biting All Blacks hooker Keven Mealamu during the first Test on 25 June.\n\nGrewcock continued to play for England in the Six Nations Championship, where he received a yellow card against Ireland. He received a suspension that ruled him out of the 2007 World Cup. Grewcock signed a one-year extension to his Bath contract, which kept him there until the end of the 2010/11 season. \n\nHe retired in 2011 and took up a role with the Bath Academy. He has since worked as Director of Sports at Oundle School. \n\nHe earned a five-week ban for a kicking offence after being sent off in 1998 at Carisbrook and six years later he received a six-week suspension after being found guilty of reckless use of his boot on Daniel Carter. When he returned in 2005 with the Lions, Grewcock was banned for two months for biting Keven Mealamu's finger. The suggestion that Mealamu had been in the process of hooking Grewcock's mouth was not proven, but the length of suspension given to Grewcock was way below that usually given to a player found guilty of biting. He also kicked Wales scrum half Dwayne Peel in the face during Wales' 11–9 victory over England in 2005. He received a yellow card after stepping over a ruck to try to win the ball before the scrum half had picked it up.\n\nOn 8 September 2002 he was sent-off following a clash with his one-time flatmate Kyran Bracken in Bath's 28–3 Zurich Premiership defeat to Saracens. Grewcock was initially banned for five-weeks after being found guilty of reckless use of his boot. Bath appealed against the ban; with Bracken's support and new photographic evidence of the incident, the appeal was successful and Grewcock's ban quashed. In March 2003, he was cited by the RFU of two counts of striking another player during Bath's 27–10 Premiership defeat to Northampton Saints on 15 March 2003. Grewcock was found not guilty of both striking charges but the unsporting behaviour complaint, where he was accused of ripping up the scrum-cap of Northampton lock Mark Connors, was upheld and a fine of £500 issued. An eventful season culminated with the receipt of a red card for punching Lawrence Dallaglio, in Bath's 30–48 European Challenge Cup final defeat to London Wasps on 25 May 2003. A post-match disciplinary hearing saw Grewcock suspended for 14 days, with the suspension commencing on 1 June 2003 and consequently ruling him out of the New Zealand leg of England's summer tour of Australasia. Consequently, having originally been named in the original 37-man squad, he was replaced by Tom Palmer.\n\nFollowing a citing, Grewcock pleaded guilty to stamping on Nathan Bonner-Evans in Bath's 18–16 home Guinness Premiership victory over Sale Sharks on 22 December 2006. He received a one-week suspension for the offence. The same season saw him cited a second time, this time for a punch on Thibault Privat in Bath's 22–16 defeat by Clermont Auvergne in the European Challenge Cup final on 19 May 2007. He was found guilty and suspended for the period 8 June – 15 September 2007 which, taking into account the close season of inactivity, meant that he was suspended from playing rugby for a period of seven weeks, the start of his season being judged to be 4 August 2007. He lodged an appeal against the ban but was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter remaining trouble-free for over two years, he was cited for striking Neil de Kock in Bath's home Guinness Premiership 11–12 defeat to Saracens on 31 October 2009. He pleaded guilty to the charge and received a two-week suspension. On 23 January 2010, Grewcock received his third red card in Bath's colours when he stamped on the forearm of Ulster's Stephen Ferris in the club's 10–28 home Heineken Cup defeat; the dismissal saw him receive a seven-week suspension. \n\nGrewcock was awarded an MBE in the Queen's 2003 New Year's Honours list, along with other players from Bath – Iain Balshaw, Mike Catt and Mike Tindall - who were in England's World Cup squad.\n\nHe is a supporter of Coventry City FC.

Worthington's preferred style was the Gothic Revival.\n\nWorthington was born in Crescent Parade, Crescent, Salford, Lancashire, on 11 April 1826. He was the fourth of six sons of a Salford Unitarian cotton merchant, also called Thomas, and his second wife Susanna (1792–1869). He left school, aged 14, and was articled to Henry Bowman, architect (Bowman & Crowther). Before he was twenty he had won two medals: one for a church design (Royal Society of Arts) and one for an essay on \"Brick\" (Royal Institute of British Architects). After completing his articles in 1847, he assisted William Tite who was building Carlisle railway station. On the suspension of this work in 1848, he went on an eight-month study tour to France, Italy and Switzerland accompanied by a friend, Henry A. Darbishire. Their journey took them through Tuscany, Latium and Campania; Worthington's notes and sketches from the trip provided him with a first-hand knowledge of Italian Gothic and Renaissance architecture, which give him inspiration for his own later work.\n\nAfter returning to Manchester in October 1848, Worthington spent a short time gaining experience of quantity surveying, before opening his own architectural practice in King Street the following year.\n\nWorthington was strongly influenced by his Unitarian upbringing, becoming committed to social reform and joining numerous learned societies, including the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, the Portico Library and the Royal Manchester Institution.\n\nPartly as a result of his social concerns, Worthington was often commissioned to design public buildings, ranging from public baths and hospitals to workhouses and Unitarian churches. These were often designed in a Gothic style, not dissimilar to that of his contemporary and rival Alfred Waterhouse.\n\n\n\nHis sons also trained as architects and worked in the family firm, Thomas Worthington & Sons. Hubert, later Sir Hubert Worthington (1886–1963) trained with Sir Edwin Lutyens and was professor of architecture at the Royal College of Art before becoming Slade lecturer in architecture at Oxford University. Percy Worthington (1864–1939), also worked for the firm.\n\nThomas Worthington lies buried at the churchyard of the Victorian gothic Brookfield Unitarian Church, Gorton, Manchester.\n\n"}

Originally a sky spirit, her compassion for human suffering brought her to earth to share our fate.\n\nLaumės are the very oldest goddesses of Lithuanian mythology. The image of these goddesses may have formed during the historical Mesolithic period, just after the Ice Age. \nLaumės could appear in the form of animals, as mares or as female goats, bears and dogs. Later, Laumės had an anthropomorphic appearance: they usually had birds’ claws for feet and appeared as women with the head or lower body of a female goat. Other forms included half-human/half dog or half mare, similar to centaurs. Like cyclops, Laumės often had only one eye. They also had large breasts with stone nipples; pieces of belemnitida found on the ground were called \"Laumės nipples.\"\n\nLaumės were dangerous, especially to men. They could tickle or tweak them to death and then eat their bodies, and in this way, they were similar to Lamia of Greek mythology. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laumės kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after very cold weathers, the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their udders. Laumės were afraid of tools made from iron.\n\nLaumės can be considered as atmospheric goddesses. It is said that Laumė was a beautiful goddess, who lived in clouds and had a diamond throne. Some myths claimed Laumė was a bride of thunder god Perkūnas; however, they did not marry because Laumė fell in love with the Moon, who was considered a male god in Lithuania. In other stories, the bride was stolen by the devil Velnias, named Tuolius. That's why Laumė liked moonshine. In other myth, the bride of Perkūnas was a Laumė called Vaiva. The rainbow was called the ribbon of Vaiva. Despite her marriage, she had a beloved singer named Straublys. Straublys had stolen the ribbon of Vaiva. During the rain, Straublys stretches the ribbon of Vaiva across the sky, while Perkūnas is angry and shouts in thunder. It was believed it is the rainbow that causes the rain, while Lithuanian shepherds had a prayer or curse by which the rainbow had to turn to pieces and make the rain go away. The other myth claimed Laumė fell in love with a beautiful young man down to earth. They both had a son named Meilius (name derived from word 'Meilė' - love). Laumė descended to the sky to feed her son with her breasts from time to time. However, the highest God found out about the son of sacrilegious love, smashed him into the highest place of the sky and gave him a place between stars. After that he cut Laumės breasts, and so, stone pieces of it can be found on Earth.\n\nLaumės descended from the sky to Earth. They lived nearby lakes, abandoned bath-houses, in islands of lakes or dense forests. Lots of names of water pools in Lithuania are named after the word Laumė. Laumės liked to gather near rivers, lakes, swamps, in meadows, there dew fell in the night in New Moon or Full Moon. They danced and enjoyed themselves, leaving circles (like Fairy Ring) in the grass. Usually, Laumės were most powerful at Friday of New Moon, at the rainiest days of the month in Lithuania. Laumės could cause hail, storm or rain by singing, dancing or by curses. Laumės song was traditionally performed during weddings up until the 19th century. The song was performed by girls dancing in a circle, with one in the middle. The dance and song was also said to cause rain.\n\nLater on, Laumės were depicted as very beautiful women, who appeared both naked or wearing very fine clothing. The Rainbow was often called a ribbon lost by Laumės. What's how they were associated with weaving. Laumės usually appeared in groups of three. They were able to do women’s work perfectly, as are especially skilled in weaving and spinning. They love children, respect industriousness and help those in need. They punish those who ridicule them, and those who are lazy. Following are two examples folk tales featuring Laumės:\n\nA woman was harvesting a flower bed and had taken her child with her. She was so busy with her work that the child slept the day through, and she left the little one behind.\n\nThe woman went home at the end of the day to milk the cows and make dinner. She served her husband, who asked her \"Where’s my son?\" With terror, she whispered, \"I have forgotten him!\" She ran as fast as she could to the place in which she left her son, hearing a Laumé speak: \"Čiūčia liūlia, forgotten child.\" The mother, from the distance, asked the Laume for her child back. The fairie said, \"Come, come, dear woman, take your child, we have done nothing to him. We know that you work very hard, at many jobs, and that you didn’t want to leave your child behind.\"\n\nThe fairies then went on to shower the babe with much treasure, enough gifts to raise several children upon. The mother went home with her precious baby and with her gifts; she was greeted with great joy.\n\nAnother woman, hearing of her good fortune, was taken over by jealousy. She took to thinking, \"I shall do the same as her, and also be showered in gifts.\" The next evening, at dusk, she took her child, left him in the fields and went home. She ate dinner, thoughtlessly, before pausing to think of her child—and the treasure.\n\nWhen she approached the field, she heard the fairies, \"Čiūčia liūlia, you left your child in greed.\" And the child screamed with such great pain, for he was pinched and tortured mercilessly. They continued their torture until the mother came. The fairies tossed the child at her feet. The babe was dead.\n\nA Laumė would come to a window and would yell, \"Hundreds born, hundreds died, what of his fate?\" Another would answer back, \"Birth at night, death at night.\" And again they would yell and moan at the window. From within another would answer, \"This nightly birth is a big work smarter not harder, to live well whole life long.\" Again, yelling at the window, \"Hundreds born, hundreds dead, what of his fate?” Another answer: \"Morning time born will be a strong worker\". And again, after some time, begins the same questioning. The answer was \"Noontime born is a very happy child, full of bubbles and envy for what is not strictly in accordance with wealth.\"\n\nIn Latvian mythology Lauma is an assistant at birth, assuring the health and welfare of both mother and child. If the mother does not survive or gives the child up, she takes on the role of spiritual foster mother for the child. She spins the cloth of life for the child but weeps at the fate of some. The fact that the cloth can, to a degree, weave itself, indicates a higher power than Lauma.\n\nOver the years, her image has gradually degraded. Accused of baby-snatching by disrespectful husbands (since she is unable to bear children of her own), her looks and sweetness were lost, turning her into an evil old hag. She weeps at her destined fate, hoping for the day when she will return to her former beautiful self.\n"}

Built in 1892 and 1870 respectively, the two buildings are good examples of late 19th-century school architecture, and the former high school is a particularly good example of Richardsonian Romanesque design. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The high school now houses school administration offices, and the East School houses court offices.\n\nThe Old Rockville High School and East School are located in the commercial downtown area of Rockville, on the north side of School Street extending eastward from the junction with Park Street. The high school is located at the corner, while the East School is separated from that building by a parking lot and parking garage. The high school is an asymmetrical masonry structure, built mainly out of red brick with granite trim. It exhibits most of the elements typical of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, including large round-arch openings, bands of windows headed by stone lintels, and a four-story pyramidal tower. The East School is also of brick construction, but is considerably more plain, with a paired brackets in its gabled eaves, and a portico supported by paneled posts rising to rounded arches.\nThe East School was built in 1870, during a period of rapid growth in Rockville caused by the post-Civil War economic boom, and was designed to relieve crowding pressure on smaller district schools. The high school was built in 1892, to a design by Francis Richmond of Springfield, Massachusetts. The era in which it was built also coincided with Rockville's continuing economic prosperity, and was built to provide a higher level of education called for by the area's employers. Although it was state of the art at the time of its construction, it served the town as a high school only until 1924, and now houses school administrative offices.\n\n"}
{"id": "1794464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794464", "title": "Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway", "text": "Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway\n\nThe Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CK&PR) was an English railway company incorporated by Act of Parliament on 1 August 1861, to build a line connecting the town of Cockermouth with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) West Coast Main Line at Penrith. Arrangements for the use of the stations at either end (Cockermouth was already served by the Cockermouth and Workington Railway (C&WR)) were included. Passenger and goods traffic was worked by the LNWR and mineral traffic by the North Eastern Railway, both of whom had shares in the company (the NER inheriting its holding from the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which had encouraged the promotion of the line). The line was in length, and had eight intermediate stations.\n\nFrom west to east:\n\nThe company had its immediate origins in a meeting at Keswick in September 1860 which agreed to promote a railway linking Keswick to existing railways at Cockermouth (to the West) and Penrith (to the East). A project for a railway linking the towns had been promoted during the Railway Mania, getting as far as a survey of the proposed route, but nothing had come of this (nor of a projected railway from Cockermouth to Windermere via Keswick). Consequently, a Keswick resident complained in 1857, \"Here we are buried - shut out from the world, as it were - 15 hours from a morning paper while other people know at an instant what happens at the other end of the kingdom\" However, the prospectus for the company argued, what would make the line profitable was not local traffic to Keswick, but potential two-way mineral traffic between the haematite orefield of West Cumberland and the coke-ovens of South Durham.\n\nThe project was supported by the London and North Western Railway (whose line would be joined at Penrith), and by the Stockton and Darlington Railway which had been behind a series of lines engineered by Thomas Bouch which together gave access from South Durham to the West Coast Main Line at Clifton just south of Penrith. The Cockermouth and Workington Railway, with which the CK&PR was to link at its western end, initially intended to support the CK&PR directly, but was not in a financial position to do so; instead many of the C&W directors took substantial shareholdings in the new line, with some sitting on its board. The company's Bill was unopposed, and its Act received its Royal Assent in August 1861. \nWork on the line began May 1862, the first sod being cut at Great Crosthwaite by the company chairman. The directors were able to make inspection trips to Keswick from either end of the line in May–June 1864; on their trip from Cockermouth they were accompanied by goods waggons, thereafter Keswick was \"supplied with coal by rail from the Workington pits\" (implying that the Cockermouth-Keswick section of the line was \"de facto\" open for mineral traffic). The line was officially opened for goods traffic on 1 November 1864; mineral traffic may have been running over it from 26 October 1864.\n\nOn 29 September 1864 passenger trains had been run from either end of the line to Keswick for an agricultural show there 'though the line is not yet officially open, owing to the punctilios of a certain government official' (free tickets were issued by the contractor for the line and the Cockermouth and Workington Railway lent carriages and staff). The Penrith-Keswick mail coach had ceased to run in mid-November 'being knocked off the road by ... the Railway Engine', but the railway was not officially opened for passenger traffic until 2 January 1865. Trains ran to and from a new joint station at Cockermouth. At first they merely connected there with the C&WR service to Workington, but by April passenger trains were timetabled to work through from Penrith to Whitehaven along the CK&PR/C&WR route. \n\nThe CK&PR had agreed with its sponsoring railways that the LNWR was to work passenger and goods traffic on the line (receiving one-third of earnings) whilst the S&D was to work mineral traffic (the S&D to receive 35% of earnings, and the CK&PR to pay for waggons). The CK&PR also provided non-moving staff. The line was laid out by Bouch with the object of the utmost economy; although the bridges were permanent (stone and iron rather than timber trestles). The CK&PR joined the West Coast Main Line by a north-facing junction at Penrith; trains to or from the south would have had to go to Penrith and reverse direction, had the NER not built a 'loop line' (at Red Hills, south of Penrith) giving a south to west junction. The line was single throughout; when the LNWR recommended instead that the line be built from the start as double-track, the CK&PR board rejected this advice, preferring to delay doubling until actual receipts justified it. Furthermore, according to a pseudonymous contemporary critic, the engineering of the line, and the purchase of land made no provision for future doubling: consequently the line was \"really a miserable affair, anything but a first-class line as it was originally boasted to be. Everything connected with it has been sacrificed to cheapness, which in this undertaking, as everyone must see, has been unquestionably carried too far. The line is single, the bridges are single; everything appertaining or belonging to it is single, and, strange to say, land has been taken up for a single line only.\"\n\nWith the adoption of 'absolute block' working in 1892 (at the insistence of the Board of Trade), the section between Thelkeld and Troutbeck had to be converted into two blocks (by the addition of a signal box just to the west of the Mosedale Viaduct) to prevent excessive delays . The line was eventually doubled over the heavy gradients between Threlkeld and Red Hills: doubling between Threlkeld and Troutbeck (west of the summit) was in effect by 1896; extension of this to Penruddock was undertaken in 1900, along with doubling east of the summit (Red Hills to Blencow) and was not completed until spring 1901.\n\nIt had been predicted that the mineral traffic over the line would (on its own) ensure dividends of at least 5% as soon as the line opened, but this proved to have been optimistic. The line cost more to build than anticipated, and the mineral traffic was not as large as predicted. The profitability was also low; through rates were effectively governed by those set by the Maryport and Carlisle Railway. These were deliberately set by the M&C at underpriced levels (as low as d per mile) which should have deterred the construction of competing lines. Unlike the M&CR, the CP&KR had severe gradients (westbound a climb of 1 in 70 between Penrith and Blencow, eastbound 1 in between Threlkeld and Troutbeck) and therefore higher running costs; a CK&PR chairman claimed that a locomotive could haul on the M&CR a train three times as heavy as it could haul over the CK&PR. Nor did the CK&PR have the lucrative local colliery traffic of the M&CR. Passenger and goods traffic on the line were, however, sufficient to make the CK&PR profitable; eventually passenger traffic became the main revenue as mineral traffic declined further. Technological improvements in steelmaking reduced the dependence of the British steel industry on Cumbrian haematite. Blast furnaces were established close to the orefield, and processed much of the ore locally. Although, initially, they needed to import coke to do so, later improvements in coke-making allowed them to increasingly use coke made from local coal; considerable volumes of Welsh coke also began to reach West Cumbria by sea. Increased foreign production of iron and steel meant a loss of foreign markets and over-capacity in the British iron and steel industry.\n\nTourist traffic was a vital contributor to passenger revenue. In 1863, a shareholders' meeting authorised the expenditure of £11,000 on the construction of a first-class railway hotel; such a hotel, the directors had urged, was essential if Keswick was to compete with the Scottish lochs and Switzerland. By 1865, when the hotel had been built, it was evident that the capital cost of the railway had overrun to an alarming extent; the LNWR advised strongly (and the NER concurred) that railway hotels were not profitable when run by railway companies; furthermore it was now thought that the hotel needed to be extended before anyone could run it profitably. The hotel was therefore sold to a separate company, floated for the purpose, with a considerably overlapping directorate, and with railway shareholders being given first refusal on the hotel company shares. Keswick also attracted day trips (works outings, Sunday school treats) from Carlisle and industrial West Cumberland, and was a popular venue for Temperance demonstrations, although much depended on the weather:Soon after the departure from Carlisle the rain commenced to fall in heavy showers, and continued throughout the whole of the day without the slightest perceptible abatement. Between eleven and twelve o'clock the whole of the excursion trains had arrived, and the streets of Keswick were literally crowded by an immense concourse of people, whose wet and weary appearance indicated the entire absence of enjoyment. It was impossible to look upon the drifting multitude without feelings of compassion. Those local places of interest which have given to Keswick an attractive reputation were unvisited, and the people seemed to wander from the tea rooms to the public-houses during the whole day … If the weather had been propitious, the Demonstration would have proved a marked success, for seldom has such a large number of people accompanied an excursion to Keswick. As the excursionists returned to the station towards evening, a more reliable estimate could be formed of the number present, which was represented by several thousands. Beyond a few expressions of sympathy with some loitering excursionists who missed the homeward train, nothing transpired in the shape of an accident to call forth regret save the serious weather, which reminded many of the not altogether groundless proverb that, \"it always rains at Keswick\"\n\nIn return for subscribing for £25,000 of CK&PR shares, the LNWR had been granted running rights over the CK&PR in perpetuity. Although in the LNWR 'jumped over the head of' the CK&PR to absorb the Cockermouth and Workington Railway, and the Whitehaven Junction Railway in 1866 (almost as soon as they had been connected to the LNWR by the CK&PR), it made no similar offer for the CK&PR until 1890 when it offered to lease the CK&PR for 5%. The CK&PR's dividend had averaged 5% over the last four years, and its board held out for 6%, which the LNWR refused to offer. The LNWR also rebuffed subsequent attempts by the CK&PR to reopen negotiations, and the latter continued to operate as a separate company until the 1923 Grouping, when it was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.\n\nThe line was closed west of Keswick in April 1966. The Keswick to Penrith section followed suit in March 1972, though freight trains continued to run to Flusco and Blencow, at the eastern end of the line, until the following June.\n\nKeswick Museum and Art Gallery displays many items connected with the railway, including the barrow and spade used in the ceremony to cut the first sod for the railway on 21 May 1862, train tickets from the 19th century, and a platform guard's whistle.\n\nThe development of the A66 road used much of the former track path from Cockermouth to beyond Bassenthwaite Lake. Much of the section between Keswick and Penrith, through the National Park, has been made into a cycle and walking route, and is maintained as such by the park authority.\n\nThere is a proposal to reopen the line as a modern railway and a feasibility study has been commissioned by CKP Railways plc to examine the business case. However, Eden District Council appears to be against the reopening plan and are allowing development at Flusco Business Park to straddle the trackbed. A proposal to demolish the Mosedale Viaduct was cancelled by the British Rail Property Board in 1997 because of the plan to reinstate the line.\n\nThe project to reopen the railway has been dealt some serious blows, including numerous trackbed breaches, lack of funding and the NWRDA saying the case was not strong enough compared to other much more urgent projects. During floods in 2015, three bridges were damaged or destroyed. This makes it even more unlikely that the railway will be opened once more.\n\nIn January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments).\n\n"}

It is the 14th stop eastbound on the current Eastside MAX. This station is where all three lines split, with Blue Line trains proceeding east to Gresham, Green Line trains proceeding south to Clackamas, and Red Line trains proceeding north to Portland International Airport. When opened in 1986, it was the busiest station on the Portland–Gresham MAX line, the only line in the system at that time, and was the terminus of 11 bus lines. Currently seven bus lines serve the Gateway Transit Center.\n\nThe transit center is next to the interchange of Interstate 84 and Interstate 205, and behind a Fred Meyer store in the Gateway Shopping Center. Neighborhoods served by this station include Hazelwood, Woodland Park, Parkrose Heights, Madison South and Montavilla.\n\nThe transit center includes three light rail tracks and platforms, with bus stops located on the east side of the station. The easternmost track is used by inbound (westbound) Blue and Green Line trains. Trains on this track open up doors to both the side and center platforms. The middle track is to the west of the center platform and is used by inbound Red Line trains. The westernmost track has a side platform and is used by all outbound (eastbound) trains.\n\nInbound Red Line trains use the center track but inbound Blue and Green Line trains use the inbound main line track because of the way the Red Line junction is configured. Because the tracks going into Gateway eastbound approach from the north, running the Red Line north to the airport from Gateway would have required the operator to change cabs. To rectify the problem, TriMet created a special configuration to the Red Line junction. Inbound, the double track line becomes a single track route about 1/2 mile north of Gateway. The track runs adjacent to I-205, crosses under the main line, then swings around north on a tight horseshoe turn, and merges with the outbound track just south of Gateway. Inbound trains then use the center track switches to cross over to the inbound track. Future construction is proposed to reconfigure the junction and build separate platforms so that Red Line trains can travel straight north from Gateway without traveling through the loop.\n\nIn comparison, the Green Line's junction with the Blue Line, 1/2 mile south of Gateway, is configured as a standard diverging junction.\n\nParking at this station and transit center was originally entirely in the form of surface lots, but in June 2006 TriMet opened a new 690-space parking garage. This compensated for the closure of the surface lot closest to the station, which was replaced by a medical building. A surface lot to the south of the station, in place since the station's opening in 1986, was not affected.\n\nThis station in the Gateway District is served by the following bus lines:\n\nThe station has the following features:\n\n\n"}

As a result, there have been two railway stations at Merstham.\n\nThe original station at was located 3/4 mile south of the current station. It was opened by the L&BR on 1 December 1841, and from 1842 it was also used by SER and was the point at which travellers between the two railways exchanged trains. The section of line between Coulsdon and Redhill was transferred to SER operation, and the new owners decided to close Merstham station on 1 October 1843, thereby forcing passengers wishing to change trains to walk between the two stations at Redhill. This was a tactic to force the L&BR to share the new SER \"Reigate\" station at Redhill. \nOnce the L&BR had given way and closed their existing station at \"Reigate Road\", Redhill, the SER opened a new station at Merstham on the present site.\n\nThis station was opened 4 October 1844.

For this feat, he was knighted in 1937. On the political front, he was a co-founder of the National Unionist Party which ruled the United Panjab Province in pre-independent India and kept Congress and Muslim League at bay.\n\nChhotu Ram was born as Ram Richpal in a Jat family in the village of Garhi Sampla, Rohtak district, Punjab Province. His parents were Chaudhary Sukhiram Singh Olihan and Sarla Devi. He acquired the nickname Chhotu Ram as he was the youngest of his brothers.\n\nChhotu Ram joined primary school in January 1891, passing out four years later. When he was around eleven years of age he married Giano Devi. He studied for his middle school examination in Jhajjar, 12 miles from his village, then enrolled in the Christian Mission School in Delhi. He passed his intermediate examination in 1903 and proceeded to St. Stephen's College, Delhi from where he graduated in 1905 with a distinction in Sanskrit. He gained his LLB from Agra College in 1910 and began his practice as an advocate in 1912. He started the Anglo-Sanskrit School on 26 March 1913 in Rohtak. He joined Indian National Congress in 1916. Chhotu Ram worked as the President of the Rohtak District Congress Committee from 1916 to 1920. Parts of his education were funded by the prominent Jat philanthropist Seth Chhaju Ram.\n\nAfter 1920, Ram tried to create a non-sectarian peasant group consciousness. He formed the Unionist Party (Zamindara League) in 1923, which was a cross-communal alliance of Hindu and Muslim agriculturists. He soon aligned with such Muslim leaders as Fazli Husain.\n\nThe Unionist Party won elections in 1935 to form the provincial government in the capital at Lahore. As revenue minister, he brought in changes in the law to stop the practice of usury (charging interest on interest). Among the supporters of the party at this point were such prominent urban Muslims as Abdul Qadir.\n\nRam initially approved the Bhakhra Dam Scheme. He got an agreement between the Maharaja of Bilaspur, in whose territory the waters of river Sutlej were to be impounded. And the Punjab Government signed only a few weeks before he died on 9 January 1945.\n\nHe studied the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and was very much influenced by its philosophy. There are many instances, which represent his value for education and compassion for the poor. A substantial portion of his salary as minister was set aside for scholarships and stipends for economically poor but bright students.\n\nThe enactment of two agrarian laws was primarily due to his contribution. These were the Punjab Relief Indebtedness Act of 1934 and the Punjab Debtor's Protection Act of 1936, which emancipated the peasants from the clutches of the moneylenders and restored the right of land to the tiller.\n\nRam died in Lahore on 9 January 1945. His body was carried back to his home in Rohtak city, where it was cremated at the Jat Heroes Memorial Anglo Sanskrit Senior Secondary School in the presence of thousands of people.\n\nChhotu Ram was awarded the title of 'Rao Bahadur'. He was knighted in 1937 and was popularly known as \"Deen Bandhu\" (in Urdu as \"Rahbare Azam\", which translates as \"messiah of the poor\").\n\nHis legacy has been evoked by the formation of a new party, the National Unionist Zamindara Party by guar farmers in Rajasthan in 2013.\n\nRam's place of residence in Rohtak was known as \"Prem Nivas\" and \"Nili Kothi\" (English: Blue Bungalow). The chowk (road square) nearest to his house is now known as \"Chhotu Ram Chowk\" and a Dharamshala exists at the same place in his name. A samadhi (tomb) was created in his memory at the school campus where he was cremated, and there people pay homage on his birthday each year.\n\nChhotu Ram State College of Engineering College in Murthal (Sonepat District), Haryana, is named after him (the name of the college has since been changed to Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology abbreviated as DCRUST, after it got the University Status in 2006).\n\nSir Chhotu Ram College of Education, Kurukshetra is named after him. Further, Sir Chhotu Ram Institute of Engineering & Technology at Meerut is also named after him.\n\nThe Indian government issued a commemorative stamp on 9 January 1995.\n\nThe Jat-Anglo Sanskrit School was started by him on 26 March 1913 in Rohtak. A Bachelor of Education college at the same campus, is also named after him.\n\nCh. Birender Singh, Sir Chhotu Ram's maternal grandson got built a 64 feet statue by Ch.

It is spread over a flat terrain under Sivalik Hills of Himalayas. The city is developed on the banks of Ganges Canal, its dominant feature, which flows from north–south through middle of the city. Roorkee is home to Asia's first engineering college Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, formerly known as Thomson College of Civil Engineering. Roorkee is also known for the Roorkee Cantonment, one of the country's oldest military establishment and the headquarters of Bengal Engineer Group since 1853. Roorkee has the distinction of being one of the endpoints of the first train journey in India (along with Piran Kaliyar) on 22 December 1851.\n\nBefore 1840, the city was a tiny hamlet consisting of mud huts on the banks of the Solani rivulet. Digging work on the Upper Ganges Canal formally began in April 1842, under the aegis of Proby Cautley, a British officer. Local works were designed and overseen by the engineer Thomas Login. Soon, Roorkee developed into a town. The canal, which was formally opened on 8 April 1854, provided irrigation waters for more than 767,000 acres (3,100 km²) in 5,000 villages.\n\nCol. P.T. Cautley, an officer in the British Army, was most instrumental in constructing the canal. According to Dept. of Hydrology the canal, which is still considered as a marvel of engineering, was built in 1853. However, water was released in the canal on 8 April 1854.\n\nTo look after the maintenance of canal, the Canal Workshop and Iron Foundry were established in 1843 on the civil lines on the canal bank which is known as Irrigation workshop nowadays. This was followed by the establishment of Civil Engineering School; classes started in 1845 to train local youth to assist in the civil-engineering work of the Upper Ganges Canal. This was to become the first engineering college established in India. On 25 November 1847, the college was formally constituted through a proposal by the Sir James Thomason, Lt. Governor of North Western Province (1843–53). After his death in 1853, the college was rechristened as Thomason College of Civil Engineering. The college later upgraded to University of Roorkee in 1949; on 21 September 2001, through an Act of parliament, it was made one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, IIT Roorkee. In 1853 Bengal Sappers and Miners were stationed here which provided a controlling influence during the 1857 uprising. Other important events in the history of Roorkee include that under the Post Office Act of 1866, it was among the first few towns to have a post office and first telegraph office in the district. Now Roorkee has a General Post Office (GPO) and a number of post offices located in Roorkee City and Cantt. In 1886, Roorkee was placed on the Railway map of India. In 1907, first provincial trunk road Meerut-Roorkee-Dehradun was constructed. In 1920, Roorkee became the first town in Uttar Pradesh to have Hydroelectricity.\n\nIndia's first aqueduct was constructed over the Solani river, near Roorkee, part of the Ganges Canal project, which itself was India's first irrigation work in North India, started by the British. The Ganges Canal led to another first for Roorkee — India's first steam engine Jenny Lind, (specially shipped from England moved on rails in India) ran in Roorkee on 22 December 1851, between Roorkee and Piran Kaliyar, two years before the first passenger train ran from Bombay to Thane in 1853. Operated by the Bengal Sappers, the railway line was built to carry soil used for the construction of the Upper Ganges Canal aqueduct from Piran Kaliyar, 10 km (6.2 miles) from the city. The locomotive rail paths are still intact. A replica of what the locomotive is thought to have looked like is exhibited at Roorkee Railway Station.\n\nThe municipality of Roorkee was created in 1868. Now it is a Municipal Corporation. It had been home to the Bengal Sappers and Miners since 1853, and two artillery units were stationed there. Today, the Roorkee Cantonment has a large army base. The Bengal Engineering Group and Centre (BEG&C), are still there today.\n\nIn 1901, when the city had a population of 17,197, it was made headquarters of the Roorkee Tehsil, in Saharanpur district of the United Province of the British Raj; the tehsil included in it 426 villages (of the \"parganas\" of Jwalapur, Manglaur and Bhagwanpur) and six towns, most important among them being Haridwar and Manglaur. The Old Cemetery in the city is a protected monument, by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nRoorkee is located at . It has an average elevation of 268 metres (879 feet).\n\nRoorkee is north of the Indian capital, New Delhi, between the rivers Ganges and Yamuna, close to the foothills of the Himalayas. It is 70.02 kilometres away from Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand. Before the creation of Uttarakhand on 9 November 2000, Roorkee was a part of the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn Roorkee, the climate is warm and temperate. Roorkee is a city with significant rainfall.

{"id": "1794477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794477", "title": "Boilie", "text": "Boilie\n\nBoilies are boiled paste fishing baits, usually combinations of fishmeals, milk proteins, bird foods, semolina and soya flour, which are mixed with eggs as a binding agent and then boiled to form hardish round baits which will last in the water. Additional flavourings and attractors are also usually included in the mix. The round shape allows the baits to be catapulted accurately when fishing at range.\n\nThe ability to provide a bait of a fairly large size with a hard outer skin, meant that the other species such as tench and bream were less able to consume the bait. Boiled baits also meant that they could be left longer in the water without fear that they had fallen off the hook, in the same way as bread or other traditional baits might.\n\nThough boilies are typically made and sold by large suppliers, many people choose to make their own unique homemade boilies.\n\nBoilies are now one of the most established carp baits, available in a huge range of colours and flavours. Boilies come in all different shapes and sizes, from tiny micro boilies (some even as small as eight millimetres) up to as large as 40 mm which are more suited to waters where 'nuisance fish' are present.\n\nThere are buoyant boilies, commonly known as pop-ups, that are used to make the bait sit just off the bed of the lake making them easier for the fish to find and take. Pop-ups can be used in various situations, where there is weed or silt present on a lake bed, or with a normal boilie to create a 'snowman' rig, the pop-up is generally smaller than the normal boilie, this creates what is known as a critically balanced bait, or neutral buoyancy, and makes it easier for the fish to take in the bait.\n\nThe carp angler has many types of boiled bait to choose from, some of which have added preservatives in them so that they can be kept at room temperature on shop shelves for a long time (shelf-life bait). Boilies that lack these added preservatives need to be refrigerated or frozen to stop them from going off; these are known as freezer baits. There have been many arguments discussing the pros and cons of both freezer and shelf-life boilies but the common opinion of many carp anglers is that due to the artificial preservatives in shelf-life baits they are not as nutritionally beneficial to the carp and therefore lack some attraction. Also, since in order to keep freezer baits fresh they need to be frozen soon after being rolled, not only will the ingredients used be of a much higher quality than in shelf lives but the ingredients used to make them will not lose much of their nutrients and attraction before being used in a fishing situation (much like frozen vegetables). Due to these facts freezer baits are often much more expensive than their shelf life counterparts.\n\nThe most commonly used set-up anglers use to present a boilie is a hair rig (the bait is not attached directly to the hook) which allows the boilie to sit off the back of the hook. This not only means that the bait will behave more naturally in the water (for example when disturbed by feeding fish) it also will often make the difference between a good hook hold and a bad one. Due to the nature in which a carp feeds the bait is blown out of the mouth soon after it has been picked up and the fact that the bait can move independently from the hook it allows the hook to stay back inside the mouth and find its way preferably into the bottom lip.\n\n"}

{"id": "1794481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794481", "title": "Suwałki Region", "text": "Suwałki Region\n\nSuwałki Region (, ) is a small region around the city of Suwałki (known in Lithuanian as \"Suvalkai\") in northeastern Poland near the border with Lithuania. Lithuania disputed Suwałki being part of the new Polish Republic after its re-emergence as an independent state after World War I. This dispute along with the Vilnius question was the cause of the brief Polish-Lithuanian War and the Sejny Uprising. The area has been subsequently part of Poland until today, with the exception of the brief occupation by the Germans during WWII. \nThe Suwałki Region remains a center of the Lithuanian minority in Poland. It corresponds to the southern part of the former Suwałki Governorate.\n\nThe Neolithic era ushered in the first settled agricultural communities in the area of present-day Poland, whose founders had migrated from the Danube River area beginning about 5500 BC. Later, the native post-Mesolithic populations would also adopt and further develop the agricultural way of life (between 4400 and about 2000 BC). The northeast corner of what is now Poland was populated by West Baltic tribes. They were at the outer limits of any substantial cultural influence from the Roman Empire. After the local Yotvingians were eradicated or Germanized by the Teutonic Order in the 14th century, their southern lands were repopulated by Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians, while their northern territories (Suvalkija) remained largely void of settlement until the 16th century when Lithuanians began to migrate into the area.\n\nThe region belonged (either fully or partially) to: the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (divided between the Crown and the Grand Duchy), the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Duchy of Warsaw.\nIn 1815 the Suwałki Region became part of Congress Poland, a state which was tied by personal union to Russia and absorbed by the Russian Empire in the aftermath of the November Uprising. The Suwałki Governorate, according to a Russian census conducted during the 1880s, was majority (about 58%) Lithuanian. Most of its territory is now part of Lithuania, with only three counties (Augustów, Suwałki, and Sejny) partially located in Poland.\n\nThe 1897 Russian Census recorded the linguistic composition of local towns: \n\nThe three corresponding uyezds (counties) had the following population (by language): \n\nThe town of Sejny was located on the Polish-Lithuanian ethno-linguistic boundary. During World War I, the region was captured by the German army and incorporated into Ober Ost. According to the German census of 1916, Poles constituted 86.6% of the inhabitants in the Augustów Kreis (district) and 74.2% in the Suwałki Kreis; Lithuanians accounted for 0.3% and 9.6% respectively. The Sejny Kreis had a Lithuanian majority of 51%, while Poles made up 43.3% of the population.\n\nIn the wake of World War I, Poland was established as an independent state, but many of the new borders were contested. In 1918 the Suwałki Region was claimed by re-established independent Lithuania based on cultural heritage and later 1920 peace treaty with Soviet Russia, but Poland officially insisted on dividing the area along the ethnic lines. \n\nMost of the area was controlled by the Lithuanian forces in 1919, and again in 1920 during the Polish-Bolshevik War. In 1920, however, the Polish control of Suwałki Region after fighting the Lithuanian forces was legalised by the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nIn July 1919, the Entente ordered the German army to leave the Suwałki Region, and adopted the Foch Line as a demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania. The line left on the Polish side: the counties of Suwałki and Augustów, the town of Sejny, and four communes (gminas) of the Sejny county: Krasnopol, Krasnowo, Berżniki, and Giby. It coincided approximately with the eastern ethnic boundary of Lithuania and evolved into the future Polish–Lithuanian border, which was internationally recognized in 1923 (while being rejected by the Lithuanian government). A small ethnically Lithuanian area (north of Sejny (Lithuanian: Seinai) and around Puńsk (Lithuanian: Punskas)) was left under Polish control. The Suwałki section of the Polish–Lithuanian border remained unchanged after World War II. \n\nDuring the Interwar period, the Lithuanian authorities claimed that the region consisted of three counties (see administrative divisions of Lithuania), that were illegally occupied by Poland. These included:\n\n\nThe aforementioned units roughly correspondended to the actual administrative division of the area into powiats of Augustów, Suwałki and Sejny of the Białystok Voivodeship of Poland, respectively. The region was the least economically developed part of Poland in the interwar period. The Suwałki Region was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1939 and adjoined to East Prussia. After World War II, Poland regained control over the territory. \n\nThe area is still inhabited by the Lithuanian minority. Lithuanians are concentrated in the Sejny County where they accounted for 20.2% of the population in 2011 and exceeded 10% of the inhabitants in two communes – Gmina Puńsk (73.4%) and Gmina Sejny (15.5%). There are Lithuanian schools and cultural societies present in the Suwałki region and the Lithuanian language is spoken in the offices in the commune of Puńsk.\n\nThe Suwałki Region has many lakes and forests and is considered a relatively undeveloped region in Poland.\n\nMajor towns:\n\nForests:\n\nLakes:\nParks:\n\n\"a\" Parts of the Augustów powiat (including the area of modern town of Augustów) belonged, with some breaks, to Mazovia (from the mid-13th c. to 1409). After 1569, Augustów was transferred to the Crown and absorbed by the Augustów starostwo ().\n\n\"b\" Buchowski gives the following data: Lithuanians – 60%, Poles – 20%, Jews – 16%, Germans – 3%, Russians – 1%.\n\n\"c.\" Most of the Sejny county (10 out of 14 communes) remained on the Lithuanian side of the border.\n\n\"d\" Puńsk had a Jewish majority in the late 19th century and was inhabited mainly by Jews in the interwar period. Today both Puńsk and Gmina Puńsk have Lithuanian majorities.\n\n\"e\" According to the Polish census of 2002, 90% of Lithuanians lived in the areas close to the Polish-Lithuanian border and nearly 60% of them resided in Gmina Puńsk. The 2011 census, which allowed respondents to declare double national and ethnic identity, found that 49% of the people who declared Lithuanian nationality (either as their first or second identity) lived in Gmina Puńsk and Gmina Sejny (3,846 out of 7,863).\n\n\n\n"}

The first station was designed by David Mocatta and was on a larger scale than other intermediate stations on the line. Horley was situated almost midway between London and Brighton, and was chosen for the erection of the London and Brighton Railway carriage sheds and repair workshops. These were later moved to Brighton railway works. The station was enlarged in 1862 by addition of a second storey to the building. A canopy and footbridge were added in 1884.\n\nThe current Horley station opened 31 December 1905, to coincide with the quadrupling of the railway line by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway.

She was born into a Jewish household, and she was the thirteenth child and seventh daughter born to Mayer and Leah Marinoff, who shortly died after she was born. At age 6, Marinoff, who was nicknamed Fanny as child, was smuggled onboard an overcrowded passenger ship headed to America. She arrived in Boston where she lived undernourished and uneducated. At the age of 8, Marinoff was sent to live with her older brother, Michael. While living with him and his wife, Marinoff was tortured on a regular basis. She was locked in dark rooms, which were infested with rats, for hours on end. A year later, Marinoff made her stage debut as a little boy in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" at the El Itch Theater. This launched the beginning of what would be a 50-year career.\n\nIn 1914, Marinoff married American writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten. The two were introduced through mutual friends in the summer of 1912 in New York City. Shortly after meeting, they formed a strong bond. Within the first year together, Van Vechten told Marinoff that she was more than he could have dreamed of, saying she was “the only one that I have ever found who completely satisfies me.” From the beginning of their relationship, Marinoff was aware of Van Vechten's homosexual desires.

He is sometimes called Ciarán the Younger to distinguish him from the 5th-century Saint Ciarán the Elder who was bishop of Osraige. His name produced many variant spellings, including Ceran, Kieran, Queran and Queranus.\n\nCiarán was born in around 516 in County Roscommon, Connacht, in Ireland. His father was a carpenter and chariot maker. As a boy, Ciarán worked as a cattle herder.\n\nHe was a student of Finian's at Clonard and in time became a teacher, himself. Columba of Iona said of Ciarán, “He was a lamp, blazing with the light of wisdom.” In about 534, he left Clonard for Inishmore where he studied under Enda of Aran, who ordained him a priest and advised him to build a church and monastery in the middle of Ireland. Later, he travelled to Senan on Scattery Island (in about 541). In 544, he finally settled in Clonmacnoise, where he founded the Monastery of Clonmacnoise with ten fellow companions. As abbot, he worked on the first buildings of the monastery; however, he died about seven months later of a plague, in his early thirties. His feast day is 9 September.\n\nVarious legends are connected to St Ciarán. One of the most famous relates that it was his cow – which he took with him as payment when he went to Clonard and gave milk to all at the Abbey – which supplied the parchment for the \"Leobr na h'Uidre\", \"Book of the Dun Cow\", one of the oldest and most important Irish literary collections, compiled by a Clonmacnoise scribe in 1106.\n\nOne story tells that he lent his copy of the Gospel of St Matthew to fellow-student St Ninnidh. When Finnian tested the class, Ciarán knew only the first half of the Gospel. The other students laughed and called him “Ciarán half-Matthew.” St Finnian silenced them and said, “Not Ciarán half-Matthew, but Ciarán half-Ireland, for he will have half the country and the rest of us will have the other half.” \n\nAnother tale relates that as a student, a young fox would take his writings to his master, until it was old enough to eat his satchel. Yet another tale tells of the other Irish saints envying him to such a degree that every one of them (apart from St Columba) prayed for his early death; and finally, he is supposed to have told his followers that upon his death, they were to leave his bones upon the hillside, and to preserve his spirit rather than his relics.\n\nThe monastery at Clonmacnoise became one of the most important centres of learning and religious life in Ireland. Unusually, the title of abbot which included the title \"Comarba of Saint Ciarán\" at the community was not hereditary, which reflected the humble origins of its founder. It managed to survive the plunderings of the Viking raids and the Anglo-Norman wars, and was only destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1552. The ruins still exist, and remain a centre of civic and religious activity to this day.\n\nThe treasures of Ciarán's shrine were dispersed throughout the Medieval era; although the Clonmacnoise Crozier still exists and is stored in the National Museum of Ireland.\n\nThe Celtic scholar Charles Plummer suggested that Ciaran of Clonmacnoise was the patron saint of Cornwall Saint Piran challenging the broadly accepted belief that he was Ciaran of Saigir. The difference in spelling is for dialect or linguistical reasons between the two Insular Celtic languages. Brytonic was catagorized as P-Celtic, as it replaced the harder ‘c’ or k sound in the Goidelic languages with the softer letter ‘p’. On the other hand Goidelic was seen by scholars as being Q-Celtic, as the earliest Ogham inscriptions used a 'Q' transcribed by Queirt, which represented the Apple Tree to phonetically pronounce the k sound, although Q was later replaced by the letter 'C' in the Old Irish alphabet. \n\nA primary school in Hartstown, Dublin 15 is named after Saint Ciarán.\n\n\n"}

The oldest parts can be dated back to around 1150–1250.\n\nThe parish is named after the old farm Fåvang (Norse \"Fǫðvangr\"), since the first church was built there (see Fåvang Stave Church). The first element is the rivername \"Få\" (see also Fådalen and the old name of Lysakerelva), the last element is \"vangr\" m 'meadow'.\n\n\n"}

He appeared as a live on-screen guest as well as scripting and recording skits for live playback.\n\nHelliar rose to national attention in 1999, when he became a regular (aka side-kick) to Rove McManus on \"Rove\", which aired on the Nine Network. In 2000, the show moved networks to Channel Ten, where Helliar and the show remained until its ending in late 2009. Helliar also wrote for the show.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Helliar was part of an ensemble cast in the comedy sketch program, \"skitHOUSE\", that ran on network Ten as well as being sold overseas.\n\nIn 2010, Helliar joined the Seven Network to appear on their new \"family friendly\" football show, \"The Bounce\", alongside Leigh Matthews and Matthew Richardson. The series was cancelled after just a few weeks.\n\nOn 18 May 2010, Helliar was guest co-host on \"The Morning Show\", alongside Kylie Gillies, while Larry Emdur was on holidays. In the summer of 2010 and 2011, he hosted the quiz show \"The Trophy Room\" that aired on ABC1.\n\nIn 2013, Helliar created, wrote, co-produced and co-directed his own eight episode comedy series titled, \"It's a Date\".

The character was the last pick in the 2004 AFL national draft, and yet to get a game for his new club Collingwood.\n\nFor the role, Helliar dons a blonde mullet wig and attempts to play up an Australian bogan stereotype. The comedy is achieved by self-effacing humour, putting Strauchan in situations that highlight his weight, lack of fitness and general inability while his egotistical personality and delusions of grandeur mean he is completely unaware of these weaknesses. The character of Strauchanie has made several subsequent appearances across different media.\n\nIn the 2009 'EJ Whitten Legends' football match, Helliar broke his ankle late in the game after being tackled.

His support for the painters George Whiting Flagg and Thomas Cole were particularly significant contributions to the development of American painting during the early 19th century. He also commissioned works from artists such as Asher B. Durand.\n\nReed was born on a farm in Green River (in the area that is now Austerlitz), New York. He began his business career as a store clerk in the Hudson River village of Coxsackie, New York, where his family relocated (c. 1789) before moving to New York City in 1815. There he became one of the city's most prominent merchants with the Front Street dry-goods firm he established with various partners, the last being Jonathan Sturges (1802–1874). With his wealth, Reed assembled in the course of six years one of the earliest and most significant collections of European and American art in the United States, which he displayed in a specially designed two-room gallery in his house on Greenwich Street in lower Manhattan.\nMaking his mark as a patron of both established and aspiring contemporary American artists, Reed attempted to nurture the creation of a national artistic culture as sophisticated and accomplished as that of Europe. His interest in landscape painting and portraiture notwithstanding, Reed was also an avid collector of genre paintings depicting scenes from everyday life.\n\nIn 1844, his substantial collection was purchased by a group of his associates in New York with the intention to form a public art collection, later the New York Gallery of Fine Arts. The collection was later donated to the New York Historical Society in 1858. It is one of the most important early 19th-century collections of American art that survives intact.\n"}

{"id": "1794502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794502", "title": "Hair rig", "text": "Hair rig\n\nThe hair rig is a fishing method which allows a bait to be presented without sitting directly on the hook. It is mainly associated with boilies, but also works effectively with many other baits. The hair rig became popular in the 1980s and was a joint invention by Kevin Maddocks and Len Middleton. It has been experimented with by many anglers, and has revolutionised carp fishing.\n\nAt the beginning, natural hair (from Len's head) was used to attach the bait to the hook after many 'tank test' experiments with captive carp and other materials. Before that all sorts of other materials were tried but a human hair worked from the start This is why it was called the 'hair rig'. This material was very discreet and the carp seemed unaware of it when picking up a bait attached to it and also taking in the hook, but it was a little fragile. In tests, the carp only took the free offerings and left the hook bait if the bait was not attached to a 'hair'. Human hair was also a problem because anglers sometimes lost their baits while they were casting. These problems have been solved with the appearance of braided thread, a new material that allows threads to be as discreet as natural ones but more resistant to breaking.\nMany believe however, that the whole concept works, because the hook is NOT buried in the bait or boilie\nand due to the carp sucking and blowing, the sharp hook point catches in the mouth or lips. A heavy semi-fixed lead (2 ozs upwards) then pulls the hook into the flesh and usually the fish bolts off in alarm, so effectively this is a self hooking rig, with no need for the angler to 'strike' as in the past. Many variations of the 'Hair' are now used by carp anglers and most of these are not like original 'hairs' at all, but 'Hook Out' rigs designed to allow the bare hook to catch in the mouth or lips.\n\nKnotless knot\n\n"}

{"id": "1794542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794542", "title": "Swithland Wood and The Brand", "text": "Swithland Wood and The Brand\n\nSwithland Wood and The Brand is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest south of Woodhouse Eaves in Leicestershire. Swithland Wood is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade II. The Brand is designated a Precambrian site in the Geological Conservation Review site, but the dating has been changed due to the discovery of trace fossils from the succeeding Cambrian period.\n\nSwithland Wood is a public woodland in Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire. Although close to the village of Swithland, it is almost entirely within the parish of Newtown Linford. It is just north of Bradgate Park and also near Woodhouse Eaves and Cropston. The wood is Leicestershire's most important ancient woodland for nature conservation. Quarries within the wood were a source of the distinctive \"Swithland Slate\" roofs found on many local buildings as well as the slate gravestones common in Leicestershire churchyards. Swithland Wood has been a public woodland since 1925, upon its acquisition by the Leicester Rotary Club, having previously been part of the estate of the manor of Groby. Since 1931 it has been managed by the Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood Trust.\n\nSwithland Wood is classed as Ancient semi-natural woodland. Medieval ridge and furrow shows that most of the area was once cleared of trees, and used for growing crops. Documentary evidence of its use as woodland dates back to 1512 by which time at least part of the site was established woodland. It was probably not 'planted', but simply recolonised the soon-abandoned farmland. However it has been woodland continuously since then, primarily managed through coppicing. It was subdivided into compartments known by various names: Great Lynds, Little Lynds, Dunham Lynns, Hollgates Wood, Slate Pit Hey and Slate Pit Hill. The woodland was part of the Grey family's Bradgate Estate throughout their time as earls of Stamford. In 1880 they had 26 woodlands on the Bradgate Estate and these were an integrated part of the Grey estates throughout the 17th to 19th centuries. The earliest known use of the name 'Swithland Wood' is in a schedule of 1772. The name now covers all of the Grey estate woodlands on this site. Adjoining the woods on the east are two areas of woodland in Swithland Parish, historically known as Stocking Wood and Whites Wood. These were part of the estates of the Danvers family, and then the earls of Lanesborough. These two woods remain private, and are not part of the Swithland Wood public woodland, although they are part of the designated SSSI.\n\nSwithland Slate has been a traditional local roofing material since Roman times. Swithland gives its name to a line of 'slate' outcrops found along the east side of Charnwood, from Hallgates and Little John, through Swithland Wood and The Brand, up to Woodhouse Eaves. All these locations have old slate quarry pits, as does a corresponding outcrop on the other side of the Charnwood anticline at Groby. Swithland Wood had been quarried for many centuries for small-scale slate production. Many of the 24 small pits in Swithland Wood may relate to early slate quarrying. Unlike the management of the woodland, the quarries were leased to local quarrymen. Two industrial scale quarries developed within the woods, one in the 'Great Pit' in the centre of the woods, and the other near the road at the northern end. Similar scales of activity also developed on the other side of Swithland Road, in The Brand, where four more water-filled pits remain.\n\nBy the mid-19th century under the management of John Ellis of Leicester, among other things Chairman of the Midland Railway, slate in the Great Pit was being extracted from a depth of more than 180 ft (55 m). Swithland Slate began being used on vernacular roofs from around 1750 and is still very common on older buildings throughout Charnwood and beyond. Unlike the thinner, lighter Welsh Slates, which are used with fixed sized slates, Swithland Slate roofs are graded from small slates along the ridge to largest sizes at the base. Notable buildings on which the slates were used included the Midland Railway's London terminus at St Pancras railway station and the Leicester houses designed by Ernest Gimson. Headstones for graves have been made from Swithland Slate since the 17th century and are found in graveyards throughout Leicestershire and in neighbouring counties, especially Nottinghamshire. They could be engraved with detailed letterings and patterns, which prove to be much more durable than on many other types of stone. Other uses included kerbstones, windowsills and sinks. Once the canals and railways could transport Welsh slate in large quantities at low prices, the demand for local slates diminished. Quarrying in the northern pit ended in 1838, and then in 1887 the Great Pit ceased production. Both pits now have deep water and are fenced off for safety reasons, but paths around the quarries afford good views of the pools and rock faces. The Great Pit is used occasionally for scuba diving.\n\nAfter the closing of the quarries the area continued to be an important woodland resource, with active timber management and planting by the Grey Estate. However in 1921, as part of a wholesale disposal of the Bradgate Estate lands, the woods, along with two local farms, were bought by William Gimson. Two adjacent areas of woodland totalling 137 acres (554,000 m²) were offered to the Rotary Club of Leicester in order to preserve these important ancient woodlands and provide public access for the benefit of the people of Leicester and Leicestershire in perpetuity. A Charitable Trust was established and a fund-raising appeal raised £6,000 (more than half of it from members of the Rotary Club itself) which covered not only the £3,000 purchase price but also renewed fencing, woodland management works and public access facilities. The Rotary Club employed rangers and managed the country park directly for seven years. On the rock face of the Great Pit is an inscription recording the Rotary Club's donation which reads \"The Leicester Rotary Club Secured Swithland Wood For A National Heritage\".\n\nThe area is notable in spring for its bluebells and other spring flowering bulbs which cover large areas of the woodland floor. In 1927 the Rotary Club, in partnership with Swithland Parish Church, initiated an annual Bluebell Service by the Great Pit, and this tradition continues, with the Bluebell Service being held on the afternoon of the third or fourth Sunday of April.\n\nIn 1928 a leading Leicester businessman, Charles Bennion, similarly bought the adjacent and larger Bradgate Park for preservation and the public benefit, vested in a Charitable Trust supported by the Leicester and Leicestershire City and County Councils and the National Trust. In 1931, with the Bradgate Park Trust fully established, the Rotary Club offered to merge Swithland Wood with Bradgate Park. This was readily agreed by all parties and the two Trusts were combined as the Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood Trust. Since then Swithland Woods has been managed by the Trust rather than the Rotary Club, open to the public, and greatly appreciated for its conservation and leisure value.\n\nAccording to Natural England: \"The site includes some of the best remaining examples of oak-lime and alder\nwoodland in Leicestershire and is representative of ancient woodland on somewhat acid, loamy soils in the English Midlands.\" Swithland Wood has received a blend of continuity and disruption in its management that has stimulated its diversity of plant life, whilst allowing complex ecosystems to survive and develop. The disruptions include the quarries, substantial periods of felling in the 19th century, construction of a water main across the site, clearing back of rides and paths, and the arrival of countless tramping feet. Each of these has impacted on some of the trees and plants, but created additional habitats, allowing other species to become established. But as a whole, Swithland Wood has had great continuity, at least since the medieval ploughing ceased. The woods themselves are mixed, principally mature oak, ash, lime and holly. These have been the predominant species for many hundred years, and on the rockiest places have probably always been there. This provides the continuity that has enabled such richness to develop. The result is a woodland with a Flora Score = 147, the highest score of any of the Leicestershire and Rutland woodlands., ahead of Owston Woods (132) and Burley Wood (125).\n\nThe ancient rocks that characterise Charnwood Forest are an eroded anticline - the layers of sediment built up on a sea floor were uplifted some 420 million years ago, at the end of the Silurian Period. This created a dome, the top of which was eroded to expose successively more ancient rocks. The oldest rocks are found at the northern core, at Blackbrook Reservoir, while Swithland Wood lies on the south-eastern edge of the anticline. The Swithland Slates and other rocks of the 'Brand Group' are the most recent of the \"Charnian\" rocks. For most of the 20th century they had been classified as Precambrian rocks along with the more central Charnwood outcrops. This would have dated them to around 545 million years ago. However, recent discoveries of trace fossils, evidence of animals burrowing in the soft mud that became the Swithland Slate, have reclassed all of the Brand Group rocks as Cambrian, formed around 530 million years ago. Although the Charnwood Precambrian rocks have the internationally significant fossils of the frond-like lifeforms of Charnia species, clear evidence of trace fossils of burrowing animal life places the Swithland Formation firmly in the Cambrian Period. Some of these trace fossils can be seen on Swithland Slate headstones, such as those in Ratby churchyard.\n\nThe mud that became Swithland Slate was deposited in great quantity on the sea bed, after the more dramatic Precambrian volcanic activity had subsided. It was very fine sediment resulting in fine-grained evenly bedded material. Subsequent deposits above it, combined with the uplifting of the anticline, produced the heat and pressure which turned the mud into hard rock (Lithification). The tensions created during uplift are what created the cleavage plane in the slates, and it is along these cleavage joints (rather than the bedding planes) that the slates are split to create roof slates. With the Charnwood area uplifted into a high mountain range, the processes of erosion began.\n\nBy the Triassic Period, (240 million years ago) the mountains were eroded down to something like their current height. There then began a new deposition, this time of desert sand and fine dust, that produced a new layer of soft red marl, creating the gentler rolling appearance of the land, with just the tips of the older rocks reaching the surface. Over most of Swithland Wood the marl is the surface rock type (although the slate beds will occur underneath that).\n\nFinally, during the ice age, glacial erosion stripped back the Triassic material (plus whatever had accumulated above that), to re-expose the eroded peaks of the older rocks. At the end of the ice age, patches of boulder clay were deposited over much of the local area, including parts of Swithland Wood.\n\nSwithland Wood is open to the public during daylight hours. There are pay and display car parks on Roecliffe Road at and on Swithland Road at . There is also access via a footpath from near the Hallgates entrance to Bradgate Park . There are several bridleways within the wood for horse-riding, and a network of marked cycle routes.\n\n\n"}

Many graphics programs focus exclusively on either vector or raster graphics, but there are a few that operate on both. It is simple to convert from vector graphics to raster graphics, but going the other way is harder. Some software attempts to do this.\n\nIn addition to static graphics, there are animation and video editing software. Different types of software are often designed to edit different types of graphics such as video, photos, and vector-based drawings. The exact sources of graphics may vary for different tasks, but most can read and write files.\n\nMost graphics programs have the ability to import and export one or more graphics file formats, including those formats written for a particular computer graphics program. Examples of such programs include GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, CorelDRAW, Pizap, Microsoft Publisher, Picasa, etc.\n\nThe use of a swatch is a palette of active colours that are selected and rearranged by the preference of the user. A swatch may be used in a program or be part of the universal palette on an operating system. It is used to change the colour of a text or image and in video editing. Vector graphics animation can be described as a series of mathematical transformations that are applied in sequence to one or more shapes in a scene. Raster graphics animation works in a similar fashion to film-based animation, where a series of still images produces the illusion of continuous movement.\n\nThis software enables the user to create illustrations, designs, logos, 3-dimensional images, animation and pictures.\n\nSuperPaint (1973) was one of the earliest graphics software applications.\n\nFauve Matisse (later Macromedia xRes) was a pioneering program of the early 1990s, notably introducing layers in customer software.\n\nCurrently Adobe Photoshop is one of the most used and best-known graphics programs in the Americas, having created more custom hardware solutions in the early 1990s, but was initially subject to various litigation. CorelDraw holds a stronger user base in Europe than Adobe. GIMP is a popular open source alternative to Adobe Photoshop.\n"}
{"id": "1794553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794553", "title": "Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth", "text": "Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth\n\nThe general sejm (, also translated as the full or ordinary sejm) was the bicameral parliament of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569 from the merger of the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Seimas of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia. It was one of the primary elements of the democratic governance in the Commonwealth (see Golden Liberty). The sejm was a powerful political institution and the king could not pass laws without the approval of that body.\n\nDuration and frequencies of the sejms changed over time, with the six-week sejm session convened every two years being most common. Sejm locations changed throughout history, eventually with the Commonwealth capital of Warsaw emerging as the primary location. The number of sejm deputies and senators grew over time, from about 70 senators and 50 deputies in the 15th century to about 150 senators and 200 deputies in the 18th century. Early sejms have seen mostly majority voting, but beginning in the 17th century, unanimous voting became more common, and 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous \"liberum veto\", particularly in the first half of the 18th century. This vetoing procedure has been credited with significantly paralyzing the Commonwealth governance.\n\nIn addition to the regular sessions of the general sejm, in the era of electable kings, beginning in 1573, three special types of sejms (convocation, election, and coronation sejms) handled the process of the royal election in the interregnum period. In total, 173 sejms met between 1569 and 1793.\n\nThe Polish word sejm is derived from old Czech \"sejmovat\", which means \"to bring together\" or \"to summon\". In English, the terms general, full, or ordinary sejm are used for the \"sejm walny\".\n\nThe Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569 and merged the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Both countries had centuries-long tradition of public participation in policy making, traced to the Slavic assembly known as the \"wiec\". The sejmik \"little sejm\" was a regional or local assembly, among whose later tasks were sending delegates and instructions to the \"general sejm\". Another form of public decision making in Poland was that of royal election, which occurred when there was no clear heir to the throne, or the heir's appointment had to be confirmed. With time the power of such assemblies grew, entrenched with milestone privileges obtained by the nobility (\"szlachta\") particularly during periods of transition from one dynasty or royal succession system to another (such as the Privilege of Koszyce of 1374). Tracing the history of the Sejm of Poland, Bardach points to the national assemblies of the early 15th century, Jędruch prefers, as \"a convenient time marker\", the sejm of 1493, the first recorded bicameral session of the Polish parliament. Sedlar, however, noted that 1493 is simply the first time such a session was clearly recorded in sources, and the first bicameral session might have taken place earlier.\n\nThe first traces of large nobility meetings in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania can be found in the Treaty of Salynas of 1398 and the Union of Horodło of 1413. It is considered that the first Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Hrodna in 1445 during talks between Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Lithuanian Council of Lords. As the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars raged the country almost continuously between 1492 and 1582, the Grand Duke needed more tax revenues to finance the army and had to call the Seimas more frequently. In exchange for cooperation, the nobility demanded various privileges, including strengthening of the Seimas. At first the Seimas did not have the legislative power. It would debate on foreign and domestic affairs, taxes, wars, state budget. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Seimas acquired some legislative powers. The Seimas could petition the Grand Duke to pass certain laws.\n\nSejms, including their senate (the upper chamber), and sejmiks severely limited the king's powers.\n\nAlready the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland has a great impact on the king's powers. From 1505 the king could not pass laws himself without the approval of the sejm, this being forbidden by Polish \"szlachta\" privilege laws like \"nihil novi\". According to the \"nihil novi\" constitution, a law passed by the sejm had to be agreed by the three estates (\"stany sejmujące\"; the king, the senate and deputies from the sejm proper - the lower chamber). There were only few areas in which the king could pass legislation without consulting the sejm: on royal cities, peasants in royal lands, Jews, fiefs and on mining. The three estates of the sejm had the final decision in legislation on taxation, budget and treasury matters (including military funding), foreign policy (including hearing foreign envoys and sending diplomatic missions) and ennoblement. The sejm received fiscal reports from deputy treasurers, and debated on most important court cases (the sejm court), with the right of amnesty. The sejm could also legislate in the absence of the king, although such legislation would have to be accepted by the king \"ex post\".\n\nFollowing the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; in most cases the senators could only vote together with the sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited. Legislative power was limited to the deputies of the sejm (not senators voting separately, except on the senate's privilege of veto, a suspension of a given legislation until the sejm votes on it again during the next session). The king, who nominated senators, ministers and other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws together with the executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created \"Straż Praw\" or the Guardianship of Laws). The sejm also had the supervisory role, as government ministers and other officials were to be responsible to it.\n\nUntil the end of the 16th century, unanimity was not required and majority voting predominated. Later, with the rise of the magnates' power, the unanimity principle was enforced with the \"szlachta\" privilege of \"liberum veto\" (from the Latin: \"I freely forbid\"). From the second half of the 17th century, the \"liberum veto\" was used to paralyze sejm proceedings and brought the Commonwealth to the brink of collapse. The growing power of sejmiks also contributed to the inefficiency of the sejm, as binding instructions from sejmiks could prevent some deputies from being able to support certain provisions. The pro-majority-voting party almost disappeared in the 17th century, and majority voting was preserved only at confederated sejms (\"sejm rokoszowy, konny, konfederacyjny\"). The \"liberum veto\" was finally abolished by the Constitution of May 3, 1791.\n\nReforms of 1764–66 improved the proceedings the sejm. They introduced majority voting for items declared as \"non crucial\" (most economic and tax matters) and outlawed binding instructions from sejmiks. Reforms of 1767 and 1773–75 transferred some competences of the sejm to the commissions of elected delegates. From 1768, hetmans were included among the senate members, and from 1775 also the Court Deputy Treasurer.\n\nIn the senate there was no voting; after all the senators who wished had spoken on a given matter, the king or the chancellor formed a general opinion based on the majority.\n\nThe Constitution of May 3, 1791 finally abolished the \"liberum veto\", replacing it by majority voting, in most important matters requiring 75% of the votes.\n\nThe sejm comprised two chambers, with varying numbers of deputies. After the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Kingdom of Poland was transformed into the federation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the numbers of sejm participants were significantly increased with the inclusion of the deputies from Lithuanian sejmiks. The deputies had no set term of office, although in practice it was about four months long, from their election at a regional sejmik, to their report on the next sejmik dedicated to hearing and discussing the previous sejm's proceedings (those sejmiks were known as relational or debriefing). Deputies had parliamentary immunity and any crimes against them were classified as \"lèse-majesté\".\n\nThe two chambers were:\n\nThe Constitution of May 3 specified that the deputies were elected for two years, and did not require reelection in that period if any extraordinary sejms were to be called. Senators for the most part were selected by the king from a number of candidates presented by the sejmiks.\n\nUsually larger voivodeships could send 6 deputies, smaller 2; ziemias, depending on their sizes, would send 2 or 1. Numbers of deputies elected to the sejm by sejmiks from particular localities, in the order of precedence, based on a 1569 decree, were as follows:\n\nA sejm began with a solemn mass, a verification of deputies mandates, and election of the Marshal of the Sejm (also known as the Speaker). (The position of the Marshal of the Sejm (and sejmik) who presided over the proceedings and was elected from the body of deputies evolved in the 17th century.) Next, the kanclerz (chancellor) declared the king's intentions to both chambers, who would then debate separately till the ending ceremonies.\n\nAfter 1543 the resolutions were written in Polish rather than Latin. All legislation adopted by a given sejm formed a whole and was published as a \"constitution\" of the sejm. Prior to the May 3 Constitution, in Poland the term \"constitution\" (Polish: \"konstytucja\") had denoted all the legislation, of whatever character, that had been passed at a sejm. Only with the adoption of the May 3 Constitution did \"konstytucja\" assume its modern sense of a fundamental document of governance. From the end of the 16th century, the constitutions were printed, stamped with the royal seal, and sent to the chancelleries of the municipal councils of all voivodeships of the Crown and also to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Such constitutions were often subjected to some final tweaking by the royal court before being printed, although that could lead to protests among the nobility.\n\nMajority of the sejms where held at the Warsaw's Royal Castle. A few were held elsewhere, particularly in the first years of the Commonwealth, and from 1673, every third sejm was to take place at Grodno in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (first hosted in the Old Hrodna Castle, later in the New Hrodna Castle). In practice, most of the sejms were still held in Warsaw, which hosted 148 sejms, compared to 11 sejms hosted in Grodno.\n\nThe sejms in Warsaw were held in the Warsaw Castle, within the Chamber of Deputies (Hall of Three Pillars), with the upper Senate Chamber located literally above it. In the late 17th century, new quarters were constructed for the Chamber of Deputies, and were joined on the same level by the senate quarters in the mid-18th century. The new Senate Chamber was the larger of the two, as it was intended to host both chambers during the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nIn the mid-15th century the general sejm of the Kingdom of Poland met about once per year. There was no set time span to elapse before the next session was to be called by the king. If the general sejm did not happen, local sejmiks would debate on current issues instead.\n\nKing Henry's Articles, signed by each king since 1573, required the king to call a general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: \"sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny\") that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) in response to an invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.\n\nAfter the Constitution of May 3, 1791, sejms were to be held every two years and last 70 days, with a provision for an extension to 100 days. Provisions for extraordinary sejms were made, as well as for a special constitutional sejm, which was to meet and discuss whether any revisions to the constitution were needed (that one was to deliberate every 25 years).\n\nIt is estimated that between 1493 and 1793 sejms were held 240 times. Jędruch gives a higher number of 245, and notes that 192 of those were successfully completed, passing legislation. 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly in the first half of the 18th century. The last two sejms of the Commonwealth were the irregular four-year Great Sejm (1788–92), which passed the Constitution of the 3 May, and the infamous Grodno Sejm (1793) where deputies, bribed or coerced by the Russian Empire following the Commonwealth defeat in the War in Defense of the Constitution, annulled the short-lived Constitution and passed the act of Second Partition of Poland.\n\nIn addition to the regular sessions of the general sejm, three special types of sejms handled the process of the royal election in the interregnum period. Those were:\n\nConfederated sejm (\"Sejm skonfederowany\") first appeared in 1573 (all convocation and election sejms were confederated), and became more popular in the 18th century as a counter to the disruption of liberum veto. Seen as emergency or extraordinary sessions, they relied on majority voting to speed up the discussions and ensure a legislative outcome. Many royal election sejms were confederated, as well as some of the normal \"sejm walny\" (general sejm) sessions.\n\nJędruch, who classifies the regular general sejm session as ordinary, in addition to the convocation, election and coronation sessions, also distinguished the following additional types:\n\n"}

It is down the line from , measured via , on the Arun Valley Line and the Sutton & Mole Valley Lines, and train services are provided by Southern. Services on the Sutton & Mole Valley Line from London Victoria via Dorking terminate here, the others continue into the Arun Valley: a half-hourly service from London Victoria to or (alternating) and . These trains usually divide here with the front (Southampton/Portsmouth) portion travelling fast (next stop ) and the rear (Bognor Regis) half providing stopping services.\n\nA new Thameslink service (TL5) entered service in March 2018, running from Horsham to Peterborough (via Redhill). This now connects London Bridge, Farringdon and Kings Cross St Pancras in central London, through north London, to Huntingdon and Peterborough.\n\nHorsham would have been an important midway point in two of the original proposals for a London to Brighton railway via the Adur valley but in the event Sir John Rennie's proposed direct line through Three Bridges (in east Crawley) and Haywards Heath was given parliamentary approval. As a result, the original Horsham station was the terminus of a single track branch line from Three Bridges opened by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in February 1848.\nBetween 1859 and 1867, the station was enlarged on several occasions to coincide with the doubling of the branch line from Three Bridges; the extension of the railway from Horsham along the Arun Valley Line; the opening of new lines from Horsham to Shoreham via Steyning and from Christ's Hospital to Guildford. Finally, in 1867, a new route to Dorking, Leatherhead and thence to London, was opened. The station was again partially rebuilt and resignalled, with three signal boxes, in 1875.\nThe present station was built by the Southern Railway in the International Modern Style in 1938 to coincide with the electrification of the line. The building was designed by James Robb Scott and is grade II listed, see external links below. The lines to Guildford and Shoreham both fell victim to the Beeching Axe in the mid 1960s, the former being closed to passengers on 14 June 1965 and the latter on 7 March 1966.\n\nIn September 2011, the station frontage was closed to undergo extensive refurbishment work to the main ticket hall. It reopened late in 2012 with a new side entrance, internal lift access, relocated barriers and stairway, a new ticket office, and new information screens. The platforms received a rebuild of the roofing and refurbished waiting rooms. Previously, the building was shared with Henfield Hire, who vacated in order to give the floor space needed to create the new features and new ceiling and lights and so completing a complete reconfiguration of the layout.\n\nServices are operated by Southern and Thameslink. As of May 2019, the off-peak service is:\n\nThere is no Saturday evening or Sunday service on the Dorking line, whilst the fast service via Crawley to and from Victoria drops to hourly in the late evening. On weekends, the Thameslink service to Peterborough runs only as far as . Sundays see hourly services to both Victoria and London Bridge and to Bognor Regis.\n\nFrom 10 December 2007, the service towards Portsmouth Harbour/Southampton Central and Bognor Regis now divides at this station and attaches here towards London Victoria via Gatwick Airport and East Croydon during off-peak hours, as part of the new West Coastway timetable.\n\nA small wooden motive power depot was built at the station in 1876. This was replaced by a brick-built ten-road semi-roundhouse together with a 46 ft (14 metre) turntable in 1880. This in turn was extended with a further eight-roads in 1900. In 1927 the Southern Railway installed a 55 ft (16.8 metre) turntable. This depot was closed in 1964.\n\nNearby is the type 13 signal box dating from 1938, which is also Grade II listed. It closed in 2005 when its controls were transferred to Three Bridges Integrated Electronic Control Centre.\n\nNew services from Horsham have been introduced to destinations north of central London from December 2018. The new timetable was originally proposed in May 2014, with services between Horsham and extended to Peterborough via St Pancras International, Stevenage and St Neots.\n\n"}

He is best known as one half of the comedy duo Tim & Eric, along with Eric Wareheim. They are noted for creating the television shows \"Tom Goes to the Mayor\", \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\", and \"Tim & Eric's Bedtime Stories\".\n\nHeidecker has also acted in several films, including \"Bridesmaids\" (2011), \"Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie\" (2012), \"The Comedy\" (2012), \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018) and \"Us\" (2019). He currently co-hosts the parodic film review web series \"On Cinema\" and stars in the comedy series \"Decker\", both alongside Gregg Turkington.\n\nHeidecker was born and raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He attended Allentown Central Catholic High School and Temple University.\n\nHeidecker and Wareheim first became known as the creators, writers, and stars of \"Tom Goes to the Mayor\", a limited animation series that originally aired from November 2004 to September 2006 on the Adult Swim channel. Tim plays \"Tom,\" the protagonist of the show. He continually brings his ideas to the Mayor (played by Wareheim), who ends up thwarting them in most cases and leaving Tom worse off than when he started. According to their website Wareheim and Heidecker had mailed copies of an early version of the show to comedian Bob Odenkirk, who agreed to take on the project as the executive producer of the series and sold it to Adult Swim.\n\nThe duo's next show, \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\", premiered on February 11, 2007, on Adult Swim. The eleven-minute show features \"live action, sketch, animation, emotions, phone calls, love, etc.\"\n\nHeidecker starred in \"Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie\". Wareheim and Heidecker appeared together as Debt Collectors on the Adult Swim special, \"The Young Persons Guide to History\" and have made guest appearances in the movie \"Let's Go to Prison\", as well as the Scottish video game series \"VideoGaiden\" and a Version 2 episode of \"Mega64\". Heidecker also had a small role in the 2011 film \"Bridesmaids\", and a leading role in the 2012 independent drama \"The Comedy\", directed by Rick Alverson and also starring Wareheim. In July 2012, Heidecker starred in an episode of \"Workaholics\". In August 2012, he guest starred in Dinosaur Jr.'s music video \"Watch the Corners.\" In the same year, Heidecker made a cameo appearance on the independent movie reviewing site, Red Letter Media. Heidecker appeared in an episode of the \"RedLetterMedia\" series, \"Half in The Bag.\" The episode is titled \"Season Finale: Step Up Revolution.\" Within the short sketch comedy, Heidecker plays a VCR repairman named \"Tim\". Shortly after his introduction into the scene, he flies through the ceiling and makes his exit from the skit.\n\nHeidecker starred in a series of films for Absolut Vodka's website with Wareheim and Zach Galifianakis. In March 2010, Heidecker and Wareheim directed a series of Old Spice commercials starring actor Terry Crews. Using characters and skits from Awesome Show, Heidecker and Wareheim (via their Abso Lutely Productions company) created an online-only show called \"Tim and Eric Nite Live!,\" originally broadcast on the website SuperDeluxe.\n\nSince 2012 Heidecker has been hosting a parodic web series and podcast called \"On Cinema\", where he and special guest (Gregg Turkington) discuss films from past and present.

He made an appearance in the 2008 Ben Folds and Regina Spektor music video entitled \"You Don't Know Me\".\n\nAlthough Davin Wood composed the music for \"Awesome Show\", Heidecker would sometimes sing and write lyrics. Williams Street Records released both \"Awesome Record, Great Songs!\" and \"Uncle Muscles Presents Casey And His Brother\" in 2008, featuring music from the first two seasons. Wood previously composed the music for \"Tom Goes To The Mayor\", and he and Heidecker form the duo Heidecker & Wood. Inspired by 1970s soft rock, they released their first album, \"Starting From Nowhere\", on March 15, 2011. The duo released a second album in the same style on November 12, 2013, \"Some Things Never Stay the Same\". They cite the influence of Randy Newman, Warren Zevon, Harry Nilsson, and Boz Scaggs. The duo will perform in October at Festival Supreme.\n\nIn October 2012, Heidecker contributed a parody campaign jingle for Herman Cain's presidential bid titled \"Cain Train\". This was the first of nine songs which would eventually become a full album, titled \"Cainthology: Songs in the Key of Cain\". All of the proceeds from the album's sales go to benefit the Violence Intervention Program. The number nine was chosen as the number of songs, and $9.99 the original price, in reference to Herman Cain's 9-9-9 financial plan.\n\nBefore the release of Bob Dylan's album \"Tempest\" in September 2012, Heidecker released a Dylan pastiche called \"Titanic\", spoofing the news that the album would feature a 14-minute track about the RMS Titanic. In 2013, he released two more Dylan parodies—\"Running Out the Clock\", inspired by Dylan's 1983 album \"Infidels\", and \"Long Black Dress\", a song in the actual style of Dylan's album \"Tempest\"—and collaborated with the indie band The Earth is a Man on a cover of Dylan's \"All the Tired Horses.\"\n\nIn December 2013, Heidecker released the album \"Urinal St. Station\" under the Drag City label with his band, The Yellow River Boys. The lead single, \"Hot Piss,\" was released in June 2013. \"Vice Magazine\" named \"Urinal St. Station\" as the best album of 2013.\n\nHeidecker and Davin Wood composed and performed the song \"Weatherman\" which was used in the 2014 film \"The Age of Reason\".\n\nOn June 24, 2014, Heidecker and Wareheim released a 12″ single, \"Jambalaya\", as Pusswhip Banggang.\n\nHeidecker's solo album \"In Glendale\" was released May 20, 2016 on Rado Records.\n\nHe released \"\" via Jagjaguwar on November 8, 2017—a year to the date since Trump's election. It includes songs about Richard Spencer, the white nationalist with the trendy haircut; about the inner monologue of Trump's private pilot, who intends to kill Trump by crashing the plane (Father John Misty contributes a cover); and about the colorectal complications stemming from Trump's poor diet of fast food staples like KFC, among other topics.\n\nHeidecker is married to Marilyn Porayko. They have a daughter, Amelia (born November 2013), and a son, Charlie (born October 2016).\n\nHeidecker joined the Democratic Socialists of America in June 2018.\n\nHeidecker describes himself as an atheist and an agnostic.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This sport and its champions were described by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Karl Philipp Moritz, Christian Joseph Jagemann, Richard Colt Hoare, Jacob Burckhardt, William Wetmore Story, Giacomo Leopardi, Edmondo de Amicis, Giuseppe Baretti, Antonio Francesco Grazzini, Ottavio Rinuccini, Gabriello Chiabrera, Tommaso Grossi, Giuseppe Gioachino Belli. Bracciale was played also in France, Germany, Austria, England, Netherlands and famous Italian champions organized tournaments in USA, Argentina, Egypt. \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" (1991) includes a brief film depiction of this game.\n\nBalls are struck back and forth with a wooden cylinder, called a \"bracciale\", worn over the forearm: if carelessly played, a broken arm can result because a bracciale weighs 1 to 2 kilograms. Originally the ball was inflated, but now a hard rubber ball is used: this ball has circumference of 39 centimetres and weighs 350 grams (originally 750 grams). Scoring is by fifteens and tens, as in tennis, in this manner: 15 – 30 – 40 – 50 or victory of a game but early was 15 – 30 – 45 – 60; the team which wins 12 games is final winner of the match. A notable feature is that the ball is put into play by a designated server, called the \"mandarino\", who otherwise is not part of the game. The receivers can reject serves at will. Pallone is often played on courts marked out on town streets.\n\nFour kinds of pallone are now played:\n\nPallapugno, or formerly \"pallone elastico\", is a game originally played in Piedmont and Liguria with a bandaged fist. This sport and its champions were described by Cesare Pavese, Beppe Fenoglio, Giovanni Arpino. In the second half of the 20th century a championship was organized in California and played during various years. The professional Italian pallapugno league is the top level of competition: in 2008 ten teams competed.\n\nEach team has four players. The court, or \"sferisterio\", is 90 metres long and 18 metres wide; the rubber ball has a diameter of 10.5 centimetres and weighs 190 grams. Scoring is also by fifteens and tens in every game, but a second bounce can result in a \"chase\" rather than an outright point, similar to real tennis; the team which wins 11 games is the winner of the match.\nPallapugno leggera is played in a court the same size of a volleyball court, but without a net. Each team has 4 players with 2 reserve players. A match consists of one set or three sets. This game is played in all Italian 20 regions and they dispute regular championship.\n\nPantalera or \"pallapugno alla pantalera\" is generally played on urban streets. The first action of every match consists of playing the ball onto a roof called the \"pantalera\" in Piedmontese language. Other rules are the same as pallapugno.\n\nThis form was invented by Italian physical education teacher Luigi Gigante in 1986 and in 1992 started a regular championship. Each team has 5 players and there are 2 goals at ends of court.\n\nPallonetto or \"pallonetto ligure al lungo\" is generally played on urban streets with tennis balls without covering felt. The playing field is long, between 60 and 90 metres, with a width of 18 metres, with or without a lateral wall. Players strike the ball using one bandaged hand in these version:\nWhoever wins 5 games is the winner of the match; other rules are the same of pallapugno. Other versions of this game are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Envelope Building, is a former industrial facility located at 121 West Main Street in the Rockville section of Vernon, Connecticut. Developed in stages between 1864 and 1916, it exhibits changes in mill construction technology over that period, include a rare early example of Second Empire architecture. Now converted into senior housing, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nThe former Florence Mill complex is located in Vernon's industrial Rockland section, on the south side of West Main Street opposite its junction with Ward Street. It is set on of land between West Main Street and the Hockanum River, which historically provided its power. Its main building is a four-story brick structure, more than in length, with a Second Empire-style mansard roof and an Italianate tower. To this are appended a number of later buildings, also built out of brick, with later industrial Italianate features.\n\nThe Florence Mill was built in 1864 to replace an earlier textile mill which was destroyed by fire. In 1881, it was described as the largest brick building in Rockville, and continued in the production of textiles. It was purchased in 1881 by White & Corbin, who expanded the building several times, making it the largest manufacturing plant in the United States for the manufacture of envelopes. The building was used for this purpose by White & Corbin and its successors (including the U. S. Envelope Company), until 1975. Currently, the building is used as an independent living retirement home and has 113 apartments.\n\n\n"}

From then on, command performances were frequently staged, often calling upon the leading actors from the London theatres, until the death of Prince Albert in 1861. There were no further command performances until they recommenced in 1881. These included plays, revues, comic operas and other musical theatre. King Edward VII called for several performances per year.\n\nIn 1911 a Great 'Gala' performance was given by the theatrical profession at His Majesty's Theatre in London in celebration of the coronation of King George V.\n\nIn 1912, King George V and Queen Mary attended an all-star Royal Command Performance at London's Palace Theatre in aid of the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund, now the Royal Variety Charity.\n\nThis was followed in 1919 by the first to be named the Royal Variety Performance. The reason for the name change followed desire from Buckingham Palace that the show should 'clearly reflect all areas of show business popular amongst the masses of the time'. Hence, a variety of entertainment, including music (of all genres), comedy, dance, music-hall and speciality acts - rather than for it be incorrectly perceived as one reflecting the Royal Family's own specific choice of artistes.\n\nKing George V became patron of the Royal Variety Charity in 1921 and decreed that the monarch or a senior member of the British Royal family would attend an annual event in aid of the Royal Variety Charity and its care home for elderly entertainers, Brinsworth House, once a year thereafter. This tradition and fundraising event for the Royal Variety Charity, continues to the present day, with the Royal Variety Performance now attracting over 150 million worldwide television viewers, making it the longest running and most successful entertainment show in the world.\n\nAs long as there has been a monarchy, kings and queens have maintained minstrels and jesters to entertain their courts, and these performances could be called \"command performances\". The history of the command performance as we recognise it today dates back at least to the time of Queen Elizabeth I, during whose reign the first permanent theatre was built. In addition, Elizabeth built her own theatre where she could watch plays performed by her own company of players. This was formed in 1583 by Edmund Tilney, the then Master of the Revels, and was known as \"Queen Elizabeth's Men\".\n\nLater British monarchs continued the tradition of sponsoring their own theatrical companies until the dissolution of the monarchy, with its subsequent abolition of the theatre, during the Protectorship of Oliver Cromwell. The restoration of the monarchy following the death of Cromwell also resulted in the restoration of the relationship between the monarch and theatre.\n\nAt the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign in 1837 the command performance was an established part of Britain’s theatrical life. The first Royal Command Performance as we know it today is generally accepted to have been that staged at Windsor Castle on 28 December 1848 by order of Queen Victoria. The play was \"The Merchant of Venice\", and the cast included Mr and Mrs Charles Kean, Mr and Mrs Keeley, Henry Lowe, Leigh Murray and Alfred Wigan. From then on, command performances were frequently staged, often calling upon the leading actors from the London theatres and their supporting casts, until the death of Prince Albert in December 1861.\n\nThere were no further command performances until they recommenced on 4 October 1881 with a production of Burnand's \"The Colonel\". Queen Victoria called for a command performance of W. S. Gilbert's play \"Sweethearts\" (together with \"Uncle's Will\") on 1 February 1887, starring Mr and Mrs Kendal. The great Shakespearean actors Henry Irving and Ellen Terry performed for the Queen in 1889 and 1893. In 1891, the Queen enjoyed two performances by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, namely \"The Gondoliers\" on 6 March 1891 at Windsor Castle and \"The Mikado\" on 4 September 1891 at Balmoral. Performances of operas by the Royal Opera Company and the Carl Rosa Opera Company were given on several occasions in the 1890s for Victoria.\n\nOn 21 July 1896 the first Royal Command Film Performance was held at Marlborough House. The film showed the Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra visiting the Cardiff Exhibition. When Birt Acres, the cinematographer, requested permission to show the film to the general public the Prince asked to see it himself before agreeing. The film was screened before forty royal guests in a specially erected marquee along with a collection of other short films.\n\nKing Edward VII called for several performances per year. These included \"Quality Street\" by the company of husband and wife stars Ellaline Terriss and Seymour Hicks and plays by Sir Charles Wyndham's company and Arthur Bourchier's company. Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company played for both Victoria and Edward during their respective reigns.\n\nOn 27 June 1911 a Great 'Gala' performance was given by the theatrical profession at His Majesty's Theatre in London in celebration of the coronation of King George V. The proceeds from this event were used to found the 'King George's Pension Fund for Actors and Actresses'. From 1913, it was decided to make this a regular annual 'all-star' event to continue contributing to the fund. The 1913 show was a production of the Dion Boucicault comedy \"London Assurance\" at St James's Theatre on 27 June 1913 and raised £1,093. These events are now called Royal Variety Performances.\n\n\n"}

He stood down at the 2017 general election, following the announcement of Theresa May's snap election in June 2017. \n\nJim Dowd grew up in Lewisham, London, with an Irish father and German mother. He was educated at the Dalmain Infant and Junior Schools in Forest Hill; the Sedgehill Comprehensive School, Catford, and the London Nautical School, Lambeth. He began his career in telephone engineering as an apprentice in 1967 with the General Post Office (GPO). Following his apprenticeship, he became a manager in 1972 at a Heron petrol station for a year before joining Plessey as a telecommunications engineer in 1973, where he remained until his election to the House of Commons.\n\nDowd was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham in 1974, becoming deputy leader in 1984 for two years. He was twice deputy mayor in 1987 and 1990, and was the Mayor of Lewisham in 1992. He stepped down from the council in 1994.\n\nDowd first stood for parliament at the 1983 general election for the seat of Beckenham, finishing in third place behind the long-standing Conservative MP Philip Goodhart by 17,330 votes. At the 1987 general election he contested the marginal seat of Lewisham West, but was defeated by John Maples by 3,772 votes.\n\nAt the 1992 general election, Dowd again contested Lewisham West, and defeated Maples by 1,809 votes. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 10 June 1992.\n\nJim Dowd was appointed as an opposition whip in 1994, before becoming the spokesman on Northern Ireland in 1995. Following the election of the Labour government at the 1997 General Election he was given a place in the Blair government as a whip. He was unexpectedly sacked after the 2001 general election, since when he was a member of the Health Select Committee and maintained a voting record strongly in line with government policies. In June 2012, Dowd joined the Science and Technology Select Committee.\n\nIn 2005, he was involved in a heated confrontation in Parliament with fellow Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews over the Terrorism Bill. He was a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group.\n\nHe supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.\n\nOn 20 January 2014, Dowd made a speech in the House of Commons during a debate on the Intellectual Property Bill, stating that he had asked for Worcester Sauce whilst eating a meal at the Hare and Billet pub in Blackheath and that he was provided with Henderson's Relish. Dowd used Henderson's as an example of \"parasitic packaging\", implying in the debate that it was attempting to pass itself off as Lea and Perrins.\nHenderson's Relish is well known within Sheffield and parts of Yorkshire and has been manufactured there for over 100 years. Dowd upset supporters of the sauce; the Sheffield Central member of parliament, Paul Blomfield, offered to bring a bottle to Parliament and invite Dowd for a meal with him using it – an invitation accepted by Dowd.\nSimon Freemanthe managing director of Henderson'sjokingly stated that he would order \"an internal investigation to find out how it got out of Yorkshire\"; a local newspaper, the \"Sheffield Star\", launched a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #Hendogate to defend Henderson's, attracting support locally. Dowd later stated his \"amazement\" at the backlash his comments had caused, which he said included threats of violence. The assistant manager of the Hare and BilletAdam Beastonclaimed that Dowd branded Henderson's a \"blatant copy\" of Lea and Perrins at the time but that he warned the MP that such a view would be \"blasphemy in Sheffield\".\n\nDowd lists his interests as music, theatre and reading, and enjoys travelling in Cornwall.

{"id": "1794643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794643", "title": "Amagasaki derailment", "text": "Amagasaki derailment\n\nThe was a fatal railway derailment which occurred on 25 April 2005 at 09:19 local time (00:19 UTC), just after the local rush hour. A seven-car commuter train came off the tracks on the JR West Fukuchiyama Line in Amagasaki, Hyogo prefecture (near Osaka), just before Amagasaki Station on its way for Dōshisha-mae via the JR Tōzai Line and the Gakkentoshi Line, and the front two carriages rammed into an apartment building. The first carriage slid into the first floor parking garage and as a result took days to remove, while the second slammed into the corner of the building, being crushed against it by the weight of the remaining carriages. Of the roughly 700 passengers (initial estimate was 580 passengers) on board at the time of the crash, 106 passengers, in addition to the driver, were killed and 562 others injured. Most passengers and bystanders have said that the train appeared to have been travelling too fast. The incident was Japan's most serious since the 1963 Tsurumi rail accident in which two passenger trains collided with a derailed freight train, killing 162 people.\n\nThe train involved was train number 5418M, a limited-stop \"Rapid\" commuter service from to . It was a seven-car 207 series electric multiple unit (EMU) formation consisting of a 4-car set and a 3-car set coupled together as shown below, with car 1 leading. The train was carrying approximately 700 passengers at the time of the accident.\n\nThe front four cars derailed completely, with the first car ramming into the parking lot of the apartment building and the second car colliding into the external wall of the building becoming almost completely compacted by the third and fourth cars, which were themselves pushed from the rear by the fifth car.\n\nInvestigators have primarily focused on the speeding by the 23-year-old driver, later identified as Ryūjirō Takami (who was among the dead), as being the most likely cause of the derailment. 25 minutes before the derailment, Takami had run a red signal, causing the automatic train stop (ATS) to bring the train to a halt. The train had also overshot the correct stopping position at an earlier stop at Itami Station, requiring him to back up the train, and resulting in a 90-second delay, about 4 minutes before the disaster. By the time the train passed Tsukaguchi Station at a speed of 120 km/h, the delay had been reduced to 60 seconds.\n\nInvestigators speculate that the driver may have been trying to make up this lost time by increasing the train's speed beyond customary limits. Many reports from surviving passengers indicate that the train was traveling at a faster than normal speed. Furthermore, it is speculated that the driver may have felt stressed because he would have been punished for the two infractions. Ten months before the crash, the driver had been reprimanded for overshooting a station platform by 100 meters. In the minutes leading up to the derailment, he may have been thinking of the punishment he would have faced, and may have not been totally focused on driving.\n\nThe West Japan Railway Company is very strict when it comes to punctuality, and commuters often depend on near-perfect timing on the part of trains to commute to and from work on time. This is because at stations (including the derailed train's next scheduled stop at Amagasaki Station) trains meet on both sides of the same platform to allow people to transfer between rapid and local trains running on the same line. As a result, a small delay in one train can significantly cascade through the timetable for the rest of the day due to the tightness of the schedule. Immediately after the crash occurred, some of the mass media pointed to the congested schedule of the Fukuchiyama Line as an indirect factor. In fact, cumulative changes over the previous three years had reduced the leeway in the train's schedule from 71 to 28 seconds over the 15 minutes between Takarazuka and Amagasaki stations.\n\nDrivers face financial penalties for lateness as well as being forced into harsh and humiliating retraining programs known as , which include weeding and grass-cutting duties during the day. The final report officially concluded that the retraining system was one probable cause of the crash. This program consisted of severe verbal abuse, forcing the employees to repent by writing extensive reports. Also, during these times, drivers were forced to perform minor tasks, particularly involving cleaning, instead of their normal jobs. Many experts saw the process of \"nikkin kyoiku\" as a punishment and psychological torture, and not as driver retraining. The driver had also received a non-essential phone call from the general control station at the time he was rounding the bend.\n\nThe speed limit on the segment of track where the derailment happened was . The data recorder in the rear of the train (the rear cars were new and equipped with many extra devices) later showed that the train was moving at at that point. Investigators ran a series of simulations and calculated that the train would derail on that curve if going any speed over . It has been speculated that the driver was so stressed about the inevitability of going back to \"nikkin kyoiku\" due to the prior infractions from that morning that he did not notice that the train was going too fast. When the driver did notice it, four seconds before the derailment, he used the service brake, instead of the emergency brake, presumably to avoid another infraction, since the use of the emergency brake had to be justified.\n\nJapanese building codes do not regulate the distance between train lines and residential buildings due to high confidence in the engineering of the rail system. Railway lines often pass close to residential buildings in metropolitan areas.\n\nAmongst other things, the Ministry of Land and Transportation asked all railway companies to update their automatic stopping systems so that trains brake automatically to slow down as they approach sharp curves.\n\nIt is believed that a contributing factor in the accident was the JR West policy of schedule punctuality. As a result of this, Masataka Ide, JR West adviser who played a major role in enforcing the punctuality of the company's trains, announced that he would resign in June 2005 at the company's annual shareholder meeting, with the company's chairman and president resigning in August.\n\nThe section where the crash occurred, between Amagasaki and Takarazuka stations, was re-opened for service on 19 June 2005. The speed limits were reduced from for the straight section and from for the curved rail section around the accident site.\n\nAccording to the investigations carried out by the Hyōgo Prefecture police, out of the 107 deaths, at least 43 (27 men, 16 women), including the driver, were in the first car, at least 45 (22 men, 23 women) were in the second car, and at least one was in the third car. This information was determined by questioning 519 of the approximately 550 injured passengers.\n\nOn 26 December 2005, Takeshi Kakiuchi officially resigned from the presidency of JR West in a move intended to take responsibility for the accident. Kakiuchi's successor was Masao Yamazaki, who had previously served as the railway's vice president, based in Osaka. While Kakiuchi's resignation came a day after another serious accident on JR East, officials at the railway did not make any explicit connection between the recent accident and the resignation.\nA 2008 \"The Daily Yomiuri\" article stated that survivors of the disaster still faced physical and mental health issues.\n\nOn 8 July 2009, West Japan Railway Co. President Masao Yamazaki was charged with negligence. On the same day, he announced at a press briefing in Osaka that he would resign, \"so the company can operate normally.\"\n\nOn 11 January 2012, Yamazaki was found not guilty of professional negligence by judge Makoto Okada of the Kobe District Court, saying the accident was not sufficiently predictable to merit a finding of guilt. The court, however, criticized JR West for faulty risk assessment of the curve where the accident happened.\n\nThe building hit by the train was demolished in 2017. As of April 2019, a memorial was built on its site and only one corner of the building was left standing.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Construction of the building began in 1825, and was completed in 1835, at a cost of £30,000. A Grade I listed building, it is his only public building in the Greek neo-classical style. The Institution held regular art exhibitions, collected works of fine art and promoted the arts generally from the 1820s until 1882, when the building and its collections were transferred under Act of Parliament to Manchester Corporation, becoming Manchester Art Gallery.\n\nIn the basement a laboratory was installed by Lyon Playfair who worked there briefly as Professor of Chemistry after he left Thomson's of Clitheroe. He was succeeded by Frederick Crace Calvert who made phenol which was used by Joseph Lister as an antiseptic.\nThe first school of design in Manchester was accommodated in the building from 1838. The school was renamed the school of art in 1853 which became a sectional department of the Royal Manchester Institution. In 1892 it became the Municipal School of Art. In the 1880s it moved to premises in Cavendish Street, Chorlton on Medlock, which it still occupies as part of the Manchester Metropolitan University. The latter building was designed by G. T. Redmayne (1880-81) and is now known as the Grosvenor Building of the Metropolitan University.\n\nThe Manchester School of Art undertook teaching at various levels and became a central institution serving a wide area around Manchester. Two branches of activity were undertaken, the training of creative artists, and the training of trade craftsmen. The resources of the school included well equipped studios and workrooms, a museum of applied art and a library. The school conferred the diploma of associateship on successful students, and also prepared students for diplomas conferred by other bodies including the Board of Education's scheme for training art teachers.\n\nAmong the vice-presidents of the Institution was Joseph Jordan, a pioneer in provincial medical education, who served in that role in 1857.\n\n\n"}

He spent two seasons there before moving to Second Division Bradford (Park Avenue), where he developed into a strong and aerially powerful right-half.\n\nDespite breaking both his wrist and leg in 1933–34, Crayston was signed by First Division champions Arsenal in 1934 as a replacement for Charlie Jones. He scored on his competitive debut in an 8–1 thrashing of Liverpool on 1 September 1934 and became a regular in the Arsenal side straight away, largely pushing Frank Hill out of the right-half spot. With Arsenal he won the League championship in 1934–35 and 1937–38, and the FA Cup in 1935–36.\n\nDuring this time, Crayston also became an England international; he made his debut in a 3–1 win against Germany on 4 December 1935, and in all won eight caps for his country between 1935 and 1937, scoring one goal. His final cap came in a 5-4 win against Czechoslovakia on 1 December 1937.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, the Second World War robbed Crayston of what should have been the peak of his career; he joined the Royal Air Force whilst still playing irregular wartime football. However, a serious knee injury in a wartime match against West Ham United in 1943 forced Crayston to retire from playing. He played 207 matches in total (168 league matches), scoring 17 goals (16 league goals).\n\nAfter his premature retirement and demobbing from the RAF, Crayston moved into coaching, and in June 1947 he became assistant to new Arsenal manager Tom Whittaker. After Whittaker's death in 1956, Crayston became caretaker manager on 24 October 1956 and permanent manager on 21 December 1956. However, his stewardship of the team was brief and unsuccessful; unable to bring any new players in, the team started to decline. In 1957–58 Arsenal slipped to 12th in the League (their worst position for 38 years) and faced a humiliating FA Cup defeat at the hands of Third Division South Northampton Town. Disillusioned, in May 1958 he resigned as Arsenal manager, and took up the reins at Doncaster Rovers a couple of months later, holding the post until his retirement from the game in 1961. He died in 1992, at the age of 82.\n\n"}

His poetry was one area through which he was well known. He was perhaps the most politically influential Jew in Muslim Spain.\nSamuel ibn Naghrillah was an Andalusian Jew born in Mérida in 993. He studied Jewish law and became a Talmudic scholar who was fluent in both Hebrew and Arabic.\n\nHe started his life as a shopkeeper and merchant in Córdoba. However, civil war broke out in 1009 against the Amirid Kingdom and Berbers took the city in 1013, forcing him to flee from Córdoba. In Málaga, he started a spice shop. His relations with the Granada royal court, and his eventual promotion to the position of vizier, happened in a coincidental manner. Jacobs, pulled from the \"Sefer Seder ha-kabbalah\" this interesting account. The shop he set up was near the palace of the vizier of Granada, Abu al-Kasim ibn al-Arif. The vizier met Samuel ibn Naghrillah when his maid servant began to ask Naghrillah to write letters for her. Eventually Naghrillah was given the job of a tax collector, then a secretary, and finally an assistant vizier of state to the Berber king Habbus al-Muzaffar.\n\nWhen Habbus died in 1038, Samuel ibn Naghrillah made certain that King Habbus’ second son, Badis, succeeded him, not his first born, Bulukkin. The reason behind this act was that Badis was more favored by the people, compared to Bulukkin, with the general Jewish population under Samuel ha-Nagid supporting Badis. In return for his support, Badis made Samuel ibn Naghrillah his vizier and top general. Some sources say that he held office as a viziership of state for over three decades until his death sometime around or after 1056. Because Jews were not permitted to hold public office in Islamic nations as an agreement made in the Pact of Umar, that Samuel Nagid, a Jew or dhimmi, should hold such a high public office was rare. His example was used to support the Golden Age theory, regarding Jewish life under Muslim rule, rather than the lachrymose view. His unique position as the viziership made him the highest ranking Jewish courtier in all of Spain. Recognizing this, in the year of 1027, he took on the title of \"nagid\", or Prince. The peculiar fact regarding his position as the top general in the Granada army was that he was a Jew. That a Jew would command the Muslim army, which he did for 17 years, having them under his authority, was an astonishing feat. Other leading Jews, including Joseph ibn Migash, in the generation that succeeded Samuel ha-Nagid, lent their support to Bulukkin and were forced to flee for their safety.\n\nAs a Jew, Samuel ha-Nagid actively sought to assert an independence from the Babylonian geonim by writing independently on Jewish law for the Spanish community. The Nagid became the leader of Spanish Jewry around the late 1020s. He promoted the welfare of the Jewish people through various acts. For example, he promoted Jewish learning by purchasing many copies of the Talmud, the massive compendium of commentaries on the Jewish oral law. He also promoted the study of the Talmud by giving a form of scholarship to those who wanted to study the Torah for a living. He died in 1056 of natural causes.\n\nIt has often been speculated that Samuel was the father or otherwise an ancestor of Qasmūna, the only attested female Arabic-language medieval Jewish poet, but the foundations for these claims are shaky.\n\nKfar HaNagid, a moshav in modern Israel, was named after him.\n\nIn 1049 CE, Samuel ibn Naghrillah arranged a marriage for his son Joseph ibn Naghrela (Yusef ibn Naghrillah) (1035–1066) to the only daughter of the most respected Torah sage of the generation, Rav Nissim Gaon of Kairouan. Joseph succeeded his father as vizier of Granada before turning twenty-one. Many Muslims, envious of his position and unhappy with Joseph's excesses, accused him of using his office to benefit Jewish friends. Joseph ha-Nagid was assassinated in a mob uprising against him on December 30, 1066. The people then proceeded to crucify his body upon the city's main gate. The following morning, on December 31, 1066, the massacre of Granada's Jews began and a mob went on a rampage in Granada, killing a large number of Jewish inhabitants. The Jewish community was later reestablished but was destroyed again in 1090 by the Almoravids.\n\nSamuel Nagid was a famous Hebrew poet of the Middle Ages, as well a patron of many other poets, and was well known for his homoerotic poetry.\nEban says that the Nagid's influence was in that he established a new style of Hebrew poetry by applying aspects of Arabic poetry to biblical Hebrew. This unique application made Hebrew poetry access the major genres of Arabic poetry. He also wrote poetry in the battlefield. When he defeated the allied armies of Seville, Malaga and the Berbers on Sept. 8, 1047 at Ronda, he wrote in his Hebrew poem of gratitude for his deliverance: \"A redemption which was like the mother of my other redemptions and they became to it as daughters.\"His main poetic works include \"Ben Tehillim\" (Son of Psalms), \"Ben Qoheleth\" (Son of Ecclesiastes), and \"Ben Mishlei\" (Son of Proverbs), each of which imitates the \"father work\". He founded the yeshiva that produced such brilliant scholars as Yitzhaq ibn Ghiath and Maimon ben Joseph, the father of Maimonides.\n\n\"Ben Tehillim\" (Son of Psalms),\n\"Ben Qoheleth\" (Son of Ecclesiastes), and\n\"Ben Mishlei\" (Son of Proverbs).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794655", "title": "Japonisme", "text": "Japonisme\n\nJaponisme is a French term that refers to the popularity and influence of Japanese art and design in western Europe in the nineteenth century following the forced reopening of trade of Japan in 1858. \n\nJaponisme was first described by French art critic and collector Philippe Burty in 1872. \n\nFrom the 1860s, \"ukiyo-e\", Japanese woodblock prints, became a source of inspiration for many Western artists. These prints were created for the commercial market in Japan. Although a percentage of prints were brought to the West through Dutch trade merchants, it was not until the 1860s that ukiyo-e prints gained popularity in Europe. Western artists were intrigued by the original use of color and composition. Ukiyo-e prints featured dramatic foreshortening and asymmetrical compositions.\n\nGregory Irvine argues that Japanese decorative arts, including ceramics, enamels, metalwork, and lacquerware, were as influential in the West as the graphic arts. During the Meiji era, Japanese pottery was very successfully exported around the world. From a long history of making weapons for samurai, Japanese metalworkers had achieved a very expressive range of colours by combining and finishing metal alloys. Japanese cloissoné enamel reached its \"golden age\" from 1890 to 1910, producing items more advanced than ever before. Lacquer from Japanese workshops was recognised as technically superior to what could be produced anywhere else in the world. These items were widely visible in nineteenth-century Europe: a succession of world's fairs displayed Japanese decorative art to millions and it was picked up by galleries and fashionable stores. Writings by critics, collectors and artists expressed considerable excitement about this \"new\" art. Collectors including Siegfried Bing and Christopher Dresser displayed and wrote about these works. Thus Japanese styles and themes reappeared in the work of Western artists and craftsmen.\n\nDuring the Edo period (1639–1858), Japan was in a period of seclusion and only one international port remained active. Tokugawa Iemitsu ordered that an island, Dejima, be built off the shores of Nagasaki from which Japan could receive imports. The Dutch were the only country able to engage in trade with the Japanese, however, this small amount of contact still allowed for Japanese art to influence the West. Every year the Dutch arrived in Japan with fleets of ships filled with Western goods for trade. In the cargoes arrived many Dutch treatises on painting and a number of Dutch prints. Shiba Kōkan (1747–1818) was one of the notable Japanese artists that studied the Dutch imports. Kōkan created one of the first etchings in Japan which was a technique he had learned from one of the imported treatises. Kōkan would combine the technique of linear perspective, which he learned from a treatise, with his own ukiyo-e styled paintings.\nThrough the seclusion era, Japanese goods remained a sought after luxury by European monarchs. Japanese porcelain manufacturing began in the seventeenth century after Korean potters settled in Kyusyu area. They unearthed kaolin clay near Nagasaki and began to make high quality pottery. Japanese manufacturers were aware of the popularity of porcelain in Europe, therefore, some products were specifically produced for the Dutch trade. Porcelain and lacquerware became the main exports from Japan to Europe. Porcelain was used to decorate the homes of monarchs in the Baroque and Rococo style. A popular way to display porcelain in a home was to create a porcelain room. Shelves would be placed throughout the room to display the exotic decorations.\n\nDuring the Kaei era (1848–1854), after more than 200 years of seclusion, foreign merchant ships of various nationalities began to visit Japan. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan ended a long period of national isolation and became open to imports from the West, including photography and printing techniques. With this new opening in trade, Japanese art and artifacts began to appear in small curiosity shops in Paris and London. Japonisme began as a craze for collecting Japanese art, particularly ukiyo-e. Some of the first samples of ukiyo-e were to be seen in Paris. In about 1856 the French artist Félix Bracquemond first came across a copy of the sketch book \"Hokusai Manga\" at the workshop of his printer, Auguste Delâtre. The sketchbook had arrived in Delâtre's workshop shortly after Japanese ports had opened to the global economy in 1854; therefore, Japanese artwork had not yet gained popularity in the West. In the years following this discovery, there was an increase of interest in Japanese prints. They were sold in curiosity shops, tea warehouses, and larger shops. Shops such as \"La Porte Chinoise\" specialized in the sale of Japanese and Chinese imports. \"La Porte Chinoise,\" in particular, attracted artists James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas who drew inspiration from the prints.\nEuropean artists at this time were seeking an alternative style to the strict academic methodologies. Gatherings organized by shops like \"La Porte Chinoise\" facilitated the spread of information regarding Japanese art and techniques.\n\nUkiyo-e prints were one of the main Japanese influences on Western art. Western artists were inspired by different uses of compositional space, flattening of planes, and abstract approaches to color. An emphasis on diagonals, asymmetry, and negative space can be seen in the Western artists who were influenced by this style. \n\nVincent van Gogh began his deep interest in Japanese prints when he discovered illustrations by Félix Régamey featured in \"The Illustrated London News\" and \"Le Monde Illustré.\" Régamey created woodblock prints, followed Japanese techniques, and often depicted scenes of Japanese life. Van Gogh used Régamey as a reliable source for the artistic practices and everyday life scenes of the Japanese. Beginning in 1885, van Gogh switched from collecting magazine illustrations, such as Régamey, to collection ukiyo-e prints that could be bought in small Parisian shops. Van Gogh shared these prints with his contemporaries and organized a Japanese print exhibition in Paris in 1887. Van Gogh's \"Portrait of Pere Tanguy\" (1887) is a portrait of his color merchant, Julien Tanguy. Van Gogh created two versions of this portrait, which both feature a backdrop of Japanese prints. Many of the prints behind Tanguy can be identified, with artists such as Hiroshige and Kunisada featured. Van Gogh filled the portrait with vibrant colors. He believed that buyers were no longer interested in grey-toned Dutch paintings, rather paintings with many colors were seen as modern and were sought after. He was inspired by Japanese woodblock prints and their colorful palettes. Van Gogh included into his own works the vibrancy of color in the foreground and the background of paintings that he observed in Japanese woodblock prints and made use of light to clarify.\n\nIn the 1860s, Edgar Degas began to collect Japanese prints from \"La Porte Chinoise\" and other small print shops in Paris. Degas’ contemporaries had begun to collect prints as well which gave him a large collection for inspiration. Among the prints shown to Degas was a copy of Hokusai's \"Random Sketches\" which had been purchased by Bracquemond after seeing it in Delâtre's workshop. The estimated date of Degas’ adoption of japonismes into his prints is 1875. The Japanese print style can be seen in Degas’ choice to divide individual scenes by placing barriers vertically, diagonally and horizontally. Similar to many Japanese artists, Degas’ prints focus on women and their daily routines. The atypical positioning of his female figures and the dedication to reality in Degas’ prints aligned him with Japanese printmakers such as Hokusai, Utamaro, and Sukenobu. In Degas' print \"Mary Cassatt at the Louvre: The Etruscan Gallery\" (1879-1880), the commonalities between Japanese prints and Degas' work can be found in the two figures: one that stands and one that sits. The composition of the figures was familiar in Japanese prints. Degas also continues the use of lines to create depth and separate space within the scene. Degas' most clear appropriation is of the woman leaning on a closed umbrella which is borrowed directly from Hokusai's \"Random Sketches.\"\n\nJapanese art was exhibited in Britain beginning in the early 1850s. These exhibitions featured a variation of Japanese objects, including maps, letters, textiles and objects from everyday life. These exhibitions served as a source of national pride for Britain and served to create a separate Japanese identity apart from the generalized \"orient\" cultural identity. James Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American artist who worked primarily in Britain. During the late 19th century, Whistler began to reject the Realist style of painting that his contemporaries favored. Instead, Whistler found simplicity and technicality in the Japanese aesthetic. Rather than copying specific Japanese artists and artworks, Whistler was influenced by general Japanese methods of articulation and composition which he integrated into his works. \n\nThe aesthetic of Japanese gardens was introduced to the English-speaking world by Josiah Conder's \"Landscape Gardening in Japan\" (Kelly & Walsh, 1893). It sparked the first Japanese gardens in the West. A second edition was required in 1912. Conder's principles have sometimes proved hard to follow:\n\nSamuel Newsom's \"Japanese Garden Construction\" (1939) offered Japanese aesthetic as a corrective in the construction of rock gardens, which owed their quite separate origins in the West to the mid-19th century desire to grow alpines in an approximation of Alpine scree. According to the Garden History Society, the Japanese landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto was involved in the development of around 200 gardens in the UK. In 1937 he exhibited a rock garden at the Chelsea Flower Show, and worked on the Burngreave Estate at Bognor Regis, a Japanese garden at Cottered in Hertfordshire, and courtyards at Du Cane Court in London.\n\nThe impressionist painter Claude Monet modeled parts of his garden in Giverny after Japanese elements, such as the bridge over the lily pond, which he painted numerous times. By detailing just on a few select points such as the bridge or the lilies, he was influenced by traditional Japanese visual methods found in \"ukiyo-e\" prints, of which he had a large collection. He also planted a large number of native Japanese species to give it a more exotic feeling.\n\nIn the United States, the fascination with Japanese art extended to collectors and museums creating significant collections which still exist and have influenced many generations of artist. The epicenter was Boston in no small part due to Isabella Stewart Gardner, a pioneering collector of Asian art. As a consequence, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston now houses the finest collection of Japanese art outside Japan. The Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery house the largest Asian art research library in the United States and house Japanese art together with the Japanese influenced works of Whistler.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Still a minor at this time (hence, his moniker \"mts'ire\"), Bagrat was compelled to remain in his capital, Kutatisi, as the provinces were being divided by the rivaling noble factions. In 1330, George V, the resurgent king in eastern Georgia, took advantage of the situation and of being Bagrat's relative and crossed the Likhi Range into Imereti, being welcomed by many Imeretians, worn of persistent violence and anarchy.

In 1922 he returned to Hungary to attend the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied composition with Zoltán Kodály, violin with Jenö Hubay, and orchestration with Leó Weiner.\n\nHe greatly admired and became a young apprentice of Béla Bartók. \nFor the most part his efforts were highly praised, both by Bartók and by colleagues. Bartók's Viola Concerto took two or three years of Serly's efforts to compile from sketches into a performable piece. It is now one of the most widely performed viola pieces. One of Serly's most famous original works is Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra. His work bringing Bartók's work to fruition has paid off in the sense that his works are often paired with those of his better known teacher, on recordings and in live performance.\n\nSerly taught composition at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City (among other institutions) and was also a featured composer/conductor with the Danish radio orchestra. He taught orchestration to Carlyle W. Hall Sr., a trumpet player and arranger for Tommy Tucker's band, who went on to orchestrate the Broadway hit musical \"Man of La Mancha\", as well as \"Cry for Us All\" (a musical version of \"Hogan's Goat\"), \"Come Summer\", and several others.\n\nAmerican Objectivist poet Louis Zukofsky wrote a dedicatory poem to Serly, published in the avant-garde magazine, \"Blues\", in February 1929. As a violist, Serly was chosen to be part of the NBC Symphony Orchestra for its debut season, 1937-1938, the same orchestra conducted by the legendary Arturo Toscanini. He left after the first season to concentrate on compositional activities.\n\nIn the course of rethinking the major developments in harmony found in the work of Stravinsky, Milhaud, Prokofiev, and Vaughan Williams as well as Bartók and other composers, Serly developed what he referred to as an \"enharmonicist\" musical language. In his book \"Modus Lacscivus\" (1975) he explored a set of 82 basic tertian chords. Serly titled several of his later works as being \"in modus lascivus\", including sonatas for violin, viola, and piano. (The 1973 edition of his piano sonata misspells the term \"modus lascivus\" on the cover, copyright, and title pages, putting the \"s\" and \"c\" in reverse order.) His \"Concertino 3 X 3\" uses this compositional system, but is most memorable for its formal structure: it consists of nine movements, the first three for piano solo, the second set of three movements for orchestra without piano, and the final set combining the previous sets, played simultaneously.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794671", "title": "High grading", "text": "High grading\n\nThe term high grading in forestry, fishing and mining relates to selectively harvesting goods, to “\"cut the best and leave the rest\"”. In mining, it can also be a term for theft.\n\nIn forestry, high grading, also sometimes referred to as selective logging, is a selective type of timber harvesting that removes the highest grade of timber (i.e. the most merchantable stems ) in an area of forest. The stunted, slow growing or poorly formed trees that are left as residuals will, if ecological conditions permit, reseed the space that has been created. Over time the practice of high grading can therefore give rise to forest stands containing stems of less value in terms of timber quality. It is different from Selection cutting.\n\nNot only are economic forestry aspects destroyed, but also ecological values are threatened. The forests so managed will be degraded in terms of biodiversity, genetic diversity and species mix. The variety needed of different ages and species mixes will be threatened and funding good silvicultural practices will be harder without an even flow of value from timber, non-timber forest products and other land values such as hunting, wildlife watching or amenity use of forests. Forests may become unsafe for people to go in them due to a large amount of unmanaged trees at risk falling on them in a storm.\n\nThe opposite of this practice is low grading, where the lower quality trees are periodically harvested, making the genetic stock faster growing and of better timber quality. Such stems might well be taken by use of thinning methods as part of a thinning régime, especially via the thinning from below method.\n\nHigh grading is a practice of selectively harvesting fish so that only the best quality fish are brought ashore. The practice is popular in situations under individual fishing quotas where only a limited number of fish are allowed to be harvested. Following the letter, but not the spirit of the law, fish are caught, and if not considered optimal, thrown back into the ocean. The practice of high grading allows fishers to get higher prices for their limited catch but is environmentally destructive because many of the fish returned to the water die. This was an issue with the EU regulation of fisheries. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, a celebrity chef, led a campaign against this with a TV show called \"Hugh´s Fish Fight\", which successfully lobbied for a change in EU law to reduce the waste (discards) from thrown back fish in sea fishery.\n\nIn mining, high grading refers to mining out the portions of the orebody that has the highest grade of material to be mined. However, it may also refer to the concealment and theft of valuable gold or silver ore by miners for personal profit. Common in the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century, high graders would usually conceal the highest grades of ore they encountered during their work day in a pocket or lunch pail, or within the body, and later attempt to fence it on the black market.\n\nAs mining companies became more aware of the growing problem, they built changing stations where they forced the miners to shower after their shift in the mines, making it easier to foil attempts at theft.\n\n\n"}

Since his departure from the band, the musical project called Recoil became his primary musical enterprise, which initially started as a side project to Depeche Mode in 1986. Wilder has also provided production and remixing services to the bands Nitzer Ebb and Curve.\nHe is a classically trained musician.\n\nAlan Charles Wilder was born into a middle class family and was raised in Acton, West London. He began piano at the age of eight, through the encouragement of his parents. Later on, he learned the flute at St Clement Danes grammar school and became a leading musician in his school bands. After school, Alan worked as a studio assistant at DJM Studios. This led to him ending up working for bands such as The Dragons and Dafne & the Tenderspots (as Alan Normal). Others include Real to Real (featuring Adrian Chilvers on bass, Pete Fresh on guitar, Wolfgang Marlander on drums and Paul St. James on vocals), The Hitmen, and The Korgis, appearing on the UK No. 13 single \"If I Had You\" (1979).\n\nFollowing the departure of Vince Clarke, Depeche Mode placed an advertisement in the music magazine \"Melody Maker\": \"Keyboard player needed for established band – no timewasters.\" Even though the ad was looking for someone under 21 (Wilder was 22) he lied about his age to get the job, and got away with it. He joined Depeche Mode in January 1982, initially as a tour keyboardist, and soon thereafter as a full member of the recording band.\n\nWilder wrote a handful of songs for Depeche Mode, including \"Two Minute Warning\" and \"The Landscape Is Changing\" (and a B-side, \"Fools\") from the album \"Construction Time Again\", and \"If You Want\" (and a B-side, \"In Your Memory\") from the album \"Some Great Reward\" and finally co-wrote \"Black Day\" (and a B-side, \"Christmas Island\") from the album \"Black Celebration\".\nHowever, Wilder's more notable contributions to Depeche Mode were as a musician, arranger, and producer.\n\nIn addition to playing synthesizer throughout his time with Depeche Mode, Wilder also played piano on the band's signature ballad \"Somebody,\" and oboe on the band's hit anthem, \"Everything Counts.\" In the documentary film \"101\", Wilder demonstrates how different synthesizer parts of a song are split and arranged across a sampling keyboard for playing them live during the concert, just one small example of Wilder's ongoing contributions to Depeche Mode during his time as a member of the group. For the recording of the album \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\" and its corresponding Devotional Tour, Wilder also played live drums.\n\nFor \"Enjoy the Silence\" from the album \"Violator\", Wilder took Martin Gore's melancholy ballad-esque demo and re-envisioned the song as a percolating, melodic dance track. The resulting single went on to become one of the most commercially successful songs in Depeche Mode's history.\n\nOn 26 June 1995, Wilder announced his departure from Depeche Mode:\n\nAfter his split from Depeche Mode, Wilder was approached by Robert Smith with an offer to join the Cure. Wilder respectfully declined.\nAccording to Wilder himself, the possibility was offered on behalf of the Cure by Daryl Bamonte (tour manager for both Depeche Mode and the Cure, and brother of the Cure member Perry Bamonte), and he declined as joining another band was the last thing on his mind.\n\nHe briefly reunited with Depeche Mode during the Teenage Cancer Trust concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 17 February 2010, and enjoyed a rapturous reception. During the encore, Wilder accompanied Martin Gore on piano for \"Somebody\". Gore returned the favour and played a DJ set on one of Recoil's Selected Events.\n\nIn 2011, Wilder provided two mixes for the Depeche Mode track \"In Chains\".\n\nRecoil began in 1986 as a two-track experimental EP. Simply entitled \"1 + 2\", this collection of primitive demos caught the attention of Mute Records label boss Daniel Miller and was inconspicuously released as a mini-album on 12\" vinyl. An album, \"Hydrology\", soon followed in 1988 and both were eventually re-issued by Mute on CD as \"Hydrology plus 1 + 2\". Wilder described the project at the time as \"an antidote to Depeche Mode; a way to alleviate the frustrations of always working within a pop format\".\n\nAlmost immediately, Wilder found himself back in the studio to record what would become the most successful Depeche Mode album to date, \"Violator\". It wasn't until the band finally allowed themselves an extended break after the World Violation Tour that Alan could return to Recoil—not, however, before agreeing to produce \"Ebbhead\", another album for label-mates Nitzer Ebb.\n\nIt was during this time that he cemented a working relationship with lead singer Douglas McCarthy who would return the favour by singing on Recoil's next album, \"Bloodline\". For the \"Bloodline\" LP, released in 1991, Wilder recruited guest vocalists for the first time, with further contributions from Toni Halliday and Moby. 'Bloodline' also marked the first Recoil single, a cover of Alex Harvey's song 'Faith Healer' as well as 'Electro Blues For Bukka White', featuring the sampled voice of bluesman White set into a post-modern context.\n\nBetween 1992–93 Wilder resumed his Depeche Mode duties as the band recorded the album \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\". Depeche Mode embarked on their most adventurous tour to date, enduring a gruelling fifteen months on the road. Although the group had reached the pinnacle of success, aspects of the lifestyle had taken their toll on everyone and things eventually came to a head. In June 1995, having spent thirteen years as an integral part of one of the most popular and influential bands the UK has ever produced, Alan Wilder made the decision to leave Depeche Mode.\n\nFree from his group commitments, Wilder could now focus solely on Recoil. In September 1996, he began work in his own studio, The Thin Line, gradually piecing together what would become Recoil's next album \"Unsound Methods\". Guest vocalists this time played a more up-front role than ever and featured Maggie Estep, Siobhan Lynch, the reappearance of Douglas McCarthy, and Hildia Campbell.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, Recoil released \"Liquid\" which this time featured fellow Mute artist Diamanda Galás, 1940s gospel crooners the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet, along with New York spoken-word performers Nicole Blackman and Samantha Coerbell.\n\nFollowing a five-year break from recording, Alan Wilder returned in 2007 with Recoil's fifth studio album, entitled \"SubHuman\".\n\n2010 saw the release of 'Selected', a selection of Recoil tracks chosen by Alan who explains: \"The collection is made up of my personal favourites, remastered and edited together into what I consider a cohesive and total listening experience.”\n\nA tour entitled ‘A Strange Hour’ was presented during 2010 & 2011 in 52 cities across the world, as part of the ‘Selected Events’, which celebrated 25 years of the Recoil project. It signified the first time Recoil had ever taken to the road. The events were not so much ‘live’ band but more art or video installation. Wilder gathered together filmmakers from as far as Russia, via the Czech Republic and Hungary, all the way to Argentina for this purpose, working very fast, and in the modern way, by creating a central server where everybody could upload their work for others to see, react to and feedback on. Says Wilder: “This for me typifies the whole essence of what Recoil is all about – a collective but with a focused direction – and a very thrilling process it was too, watching and hearing ’A Strange Hour’ come together from our base in the UK.”\n\nRecoil returned in 2012 to release the concert film 'A Strange Hour In Budapest' on Blu-ray, with 5.1 surround sound, directed by Attila Herkó.\n\nAlso in 2012, we saw Alan Wilder turn up again as Executive Producer & contributor for a new tribute album to Mark Hollis & Talk Talk. Recoil offered two cover versions for the album featuring the vocals of Linton Kwesi Johnson, Shara Worden and Paul Marshall. Wilder also mixed a track for Richard Reed Parry from Arcade Fire. ‘Spirit of Talk Talk’ was released in September 2012 on Fierce Panda Records.\n\n\nWilder appeared on all of Depeche Mode's releases from \"Get the Balance Right\" (31 January 1983) up to \"In Your Room\" (10 January 1994), later taking part in reissues and compilations containing material from his time in the band.\n\nStudio albums:\n\nLive albums:\n\nCompilations:\n\nSingles:\n\nVideo albums:\n\n\nWilder organized with Omega an auction selling a lot of DM collectable items on 3 September 2011 in Manchester. A DVD called \"Collected +\" was released as promotion for these events.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794676", "title": "Emily Thornberry", "text": "Emily Thornberry\n\nEmily Anne Thornberry (born 27 July 1960) is a British politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington South and Finsbury since 2005. A member of the Labour Party, she has served as Shadow Secretary of State for International Trade since 2020. She had previously served in the Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn as Shadow First Secretary of State from 2017 to 2020 and Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2016 to 2020. \n\nThornberry practised as a barrister from 1985 to 2005. She was first elected to Parliament in 2005, and served as Shadow Attorney General in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2011 until she resigned in 2014 after sending a tweet that was described as \"snobby\". After Jeremy Corbyn won the 2015 leadership election, Thornberry was appointed shadow employment minister. In January 2016, she was appointed Shadow Defence Secretary, and in June 2016 she was appointed Shadow Foreign Secretary. She was a candidate to succeed Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party in the 2020 leadership election, but was eliminated from the race after failing to obtain the number of nominations needed. She was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet of Keir Starmer as Shadow International Trade Secretary in April 2020, succeeding Barry Gardiner.\n\nThornberry was born in Guildford, Surrey on 27 July 1960. Her parents were Sallie Thornberry, a teacher, and Cedric Thornberry, at the time teaching international law at the London School of Economics, and later a United Nations Assistant Secretary-General. When Thornberry was seven, her parents divorced and she had to leave their home with her mother and two brothers. After this, she relied on free school meals and food parcels, and their cats were euthanised to save money. Her mother later became a Labour councillor and mayor, and her father stood as the Labour candidate for Guildford in the 1966 general election.\n\nShe failed the eleven-plus exam, so attended a secondary modern school. She left to live with her father when she was fifteen until he left without warning to work for the United Nations when she was seventeen. She worked as a cleaner and a barmaid in London alongside resitting her O-Levels and taking her A-Levels. She went on to study law at the University of Kent in Canterbury, graduating in 1982. She was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn and practised as a barrister specialising in human rights law from 1985 to 2005 under Michael Mansfield at Tooks Chambers.\n\nThornberry joined the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1985.\n\nIn the 2001 general election, she stood as the Labour candidate in Canterbury, but was defeated by the Conservative incumbent, Julian Brazier.\n\nFollowing the decision of Chris Smith not to stand again, Thornberry was selected as the Labour candidate for Islington South and Finsbury for the 2005 general election through an all-women shortlist of prospective candidates. She was elected to Parliament with a majority of 484. Nick Smith (who subsequently was elected to Parliament representing Blaenau Gwent) served as her election agent.\n\nThornberry made her maiden speech in the House of Commons on 24 May 2005. In Parliament, she has been a member of the Environmental Audit Committee and was on the Communities and Local Government Select Committee during the 2005–10 Parliament. She has served as vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Cycling Group and the All-Party Parliamentary Pro-Choice and Sexual Health Group.\n\nIn 2006, Thornberry was criticised by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Philip Mawer for adding a quote from herself into a news release by the Electoral Commission. She was found not to have broken the Parliamentary code of conduct.\n\nThornberry's main interests since becoming an MP have been in health, housing, the environment and equality. She has also spoken on the need for more affordable housing, particularly in Islington. In 2006, Thornberry introduced the Housing Association Bill, a Private Member's Bill which sought to improve the control of housing association tenants over their landlords. Many of the ideas from this bill were taken up by the Cave Review. On environmental matters, Thornberry worked with Friends of the Earth and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to campaign for a Climate Change Bill and a Marine Bill. In 2006, Thornberry won the ePolitix Award for Environment Champion of the Year after being nominated by WWF.\n\nIn 2008, Thornberry supported a change in the law to allow single women and lesbian couples to seek in vitro fertilisation treatment.\n\nIn 2009, she was appointed as a ministerial aide in the Department of Energy and Climate Change and attended the Copenhagen Summit in December that year with Joan Ruddock and Ed Miliband.\n\nIn May 2010, Thornberry was returned as MP for Islington South and Finsbury with an increased majority, in a seat identified as the Liberal Democrats' top target in England for the 2010 general election.\n\nThornberry was promoted to Shadow Minister for the Department of Energy and Climate Change in May 2010. In the role she shadowed Charles Hendry. Thornberry missed out on a place in Labour's shadow cabinet, then elected by Labour MPs, by one vote. She was instead promoted to the role of shadow care minister under the shadow health secretary John Healey.\n\nAs shadow care minister, Thornberry criticised the coalition government's lack of action over failing care home operator Southern Cross, calling for action and that the government put in place a plan B should the operator fail. She criticised the government over the Winterborne View care home abuse scandal, calling for an investigation into the affair. In April 2011, Thornberry surveyed all the local government directors of adult social care and highlighted the pressures on care for the elderly by the coalition government's cuts to local authority funds.\n\nThornberry was appointed shadow attorney general in October 2011, in which capacity she attended shadow cabinet meetings. Thornberry called for action by Dominic Grieve over Applied Language Solutions' failure to provide interpreters for court proceedings, and called on the attorney general to ensure that allegations of bribery involving Bernie Ecclestone were properly investigated.\n\nIn 2011, Thornberry challenged David Cameron over his false claims about wages at Islington Council, campaigning against government measures which Thornberry claimed to have exacerbated child poverty in Islington, and answering over 1,000 enquiries a month from constituents.\n\nThornberry resigned her shadow cabinet position on 20 November 2014, shortly after polls closed in the Rochester and Strood by-election. Earlier in the day, she had received criticism after tweeting a photograph of a house in the constituency adorned with three flags of St. George and the owner's white van parked outside on the driveway, under the caption \"Image from #Rochester\", provoking accusations of snobbery. She was criticised by fellow Labour Party MPs, including leader Ed Miliband who said her tweet conveyed a \"sense of disrespect\", Chris Bryant who said that it broke the \"first rule of politics\" and Simon Danczuk who said that the party had been \"hijacked by the north London liberal elite\".\n\nIn September 2015, she was appointed as the shadow minister for employment by the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. She was promoted to shadow defence secretary in January 2016, replacing Maria Eagle. Thornberry advocated spending money on the army rather than on the UK's Trident nuclear programme. On being appointed, Thornberry was interviewed by the British Forces Broadcasting Service, where she defended her appointment, saying she had \"quite a lot more experience than people might think.\" During her role as shadow defence secretary, Thornberry conducted a review of defence policy, including the role of the nuclear deterrent, which was delayed following the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. During a private Labour discussion about the nuclear deterrent, Thornberry asked what \"Defcon One\", a status of the United States nuclear defence rating, meant.\n\nThornberry was promoted to Shadow Foreign Secretary in June 2016 after Corbyn fired Hilary Benn. She held the role of Shadow Brexit Secretary concurrently until Keir Starmer took on the role later that year. She accused Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan of sexism after he asked her to name French minister of foreign affairs and international development, Jean-Marc Ayrault and the president of South Korea, which she was unable to do. Following the 2017 general election, she was given the additional role of Shadow First Secretary of State, effectively acting as Corbyn's number 2.\n\nThornberry opposed Britain's involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis. She said that \"while Saudi Arabia will remain a valued strategic, security and economic ally in the years to come, our support for their forces in Yemen must be suspended until the alleged violations of international humanitarian law in that conflict have been fully and independently investigated.\" In May 2018 Thornberry said support in Syria for the country's president, Bashar al-Assad, had been “underestimated” in the West. In October 2018 Thornberry criticised Theresa May's government's response to Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance as \"too little, too late\". She said: \"Imagine how this government would have reacted if either Russia or Iran had abducted–and in all likelihood murdered–one of their dissident journalists within the sovereign territory of another country.\"\n\nAfter Corbyn announced he was stepping down as leader, Thornberry was the first person to officially announce that she would be running for leader of the Labour Party, in the 2020 leadership election.\n\nIn the week after the election, defeated Labour MP Caroline Flint appeared on \"Sophy Ridge on Sunday\" and accused Thornberry of saying that Brexit voters in Northern England were 'stupid'. Thornberry appeared on \"ITV News\" and accused Flint of 'making up shit about her' and threatened to take legal action. She was eventually eliminated from the leadership election after failing to achieve enough nominations from the party's MPs and MEPs.\n\nAfter the killing of Qasem Soleimani in the 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, Thornberry condemned the actions of the United States government. She said that she shed no tears over the death, but was fearful of escalating tensions in the region.\n\nThornberry was replaced as Shadow Foreign Secretary by Lisa Nandy upon the election of Keir Starmer as Leader of the Labour Party. Thornberry herself was not sacked from the Official Opposition frontbench, but instead moved to a lower-ranking frontbench role, becoming the new Shadow Secretary of State for International Trade. She replaced Barry Gardiner, and said on Twitter that, \"It's been a pleasure to work with Barry Gardiner these past four years... I hope I can take the fight to the government on International Trade as effectively as he did, and I'll be very lucky to have his advice\".\n\nThornberry's constituency falls within the London Borough of Islington, one of the most deprived areas of the country with disproportionately high house prices and private sector rents. She has supported measures by Islington Council to free up under-occupied homes by supporting tenants to downsize and to stop foreign investors from buying new homes and leaving them empty. She has also called for a greater degree of control over private sector rents and more support for social house-building. Thornberry has frequently campaigned for a greater commitment to affordable and social housing. She was criticised when the local \"Islington Tribune\" newspaper discovered that her husband had bought a former social house which was being rented out to her aides. Thornberry said the purchase was \"not about property speculation\".\n\nIn 2015 Thornberry clashed with Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, over the proposed redevelopments of the Mount Pleasant Mail Centre, the sorting office run by the Royal Mail, and the Clerkenwell Fire Station, both in her constituency. Camden and Islington councils sought to require a high proportion of the resulting new homes to be made available for social rent, but Johnson overturned this and allowed homes designated as \"affordable\" to charge rents of up to 80 percent of market rates. Thornberry criticised Johnson, describing his definition of affordability as \"nonsense\", and called for at least 50% of homes in the new developments to be made available for social rent.\n\nIn 2013, the 100th anniversary of the death of the suffragette Emily Davison, Thornberry called for a statue commemorating Davison in Parliament. She arranged a public meeting to discuss options for a memorial, attended by around 800 people, and settled on the idea of a statue as an appropriate memorial, pointing out that there were very few statues of female politicians and activists in Parliament.\n\nIn March 2015, Thornberry launched a campaign for a new Equal Pay Act. She said that, 45 years after the original Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970, women still earned 19% less than men on average.\n\nThornberry has lived in Islington since the early 1990s. In July 1991 she married fellow barrister Christopher Nugee, of Wilberforce Chambers, in Tower Hamlets, and they have two sons and a daughter. Nugee later became a Queen's Counsel, then a High Court Judge, when he was knighted, at which point Thornberry became entitled to be styled Lady Nugee, although she does not use the title. Since 1993 they have lived on Richmond Crescent, Barnsbury, where Tony Blair also lived until the 1997 general election, moving in on the same day as the Blairs. Thornberry also part-owns properties in Guildford and South London; her property portfolio \"is believed to be worth £4.6 million.\"\n\nIn April 2005, it was reported that Thornberry had sent her son to the partially selective Dame Alice Owen's state school from her home and outside her constituency. The school was formerly based in Islington and still reserves ten per cent of its places for Islington pupils. The Labour Party opposes selection and Thornberry was widely criticised over the issue as a result. Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools, said: \"I celebrate her good sense as a parent and deplore her hypocrisy as a politician. When will those who espouse the virtues of comprehensive education apply the logic of their political message to their children?\" Later, Thornberry's daughter attended the same school.\n\n\n\n"}
