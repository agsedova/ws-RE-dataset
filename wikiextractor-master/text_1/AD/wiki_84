The system will include different types of rapid transit like light rail (which will run underground in some areas), bus and more.\n\nWork on the Red Line, the first in the project, started on September 21, 2011, following years of preparatory works and numerous delays. The Red line is planned to open in 2021. Construction of the Purple line started in December 2018. Work on the Green line was set to begin in January 2019.\n\nThe first proposals for a tramway in the area were made by the Lebanese engineer George Franjieh in November 1892, about nine weeks after the inauguration of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway. The plan called for a main line between southern and northeastern Jaffa, with spurs to the harbor and the eastern orchards. The plan was considered uneconomical and was shelved. A later plan called for a light railway from Jaffa to the nearby settlements of Rishon LeZion, Petah Tikva and Wilhelma.\n\nA Decauville light railway was built in Jaffa and Tel Aviv in World War I, connecting the port with the Yarkon River. It was used for about a decade after the war, and dismantled at a later date.\n\nA subway system was first planned in the mid-1960s, and in 1967 a station at the Shalom Meir Tower was inaugurated in the presence of then Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. However, financial difficulties forced the abandonment of the project, and Shalom Meir remains the only subway station in Tel Aviv, disconnected from other transport links.\n\nIn 2000, the plan for a subway was changed to one for light rail, and more plausible plans for a mass transit system in Tel Aviv were unveiled. The first Red Line has been approved, and excavation began in late 2009, with construction of the underground stations beginning in August 2015. The Red Line is expected to become operational in 2021.\n\nIn December 2006, the MTS group was awarded a BOT contract for the Red Line of the light rail, by which they are to build and operate the line for its first 32 years. MTS consisted of Africa Israel, Siemens of Germany, the Egged Bus Cooperative, Chinese infrastructure company CCECC, the Portuguese infrastructure firm Soares da Costa, and the leading Dutch transportation company HTM. After many years of delays due to MTS financing issues, in December 2010 the government revoked MTS' concession and nationalized the project, putting it under the authority of NTA, the government agency which was in charge with overseeing the overall development of the rapid transit system in the Tel Aviv metro area.\n\nConstruction on the first line, from Bat Yam to Petah Tikva, began in August 2015. In February 2017, most of the stations on the red line were already under construction. The preparations for the construction of the second line (Green Line) started on February 5, 2017 on Ibn Gabirol Street in Tel Aviv. Infrastructure works for the Purple Line began in December 2018.\n\nThe blueprint includes four lines: two in planning stages, one under approval and one under construction. They will cover 100 km (62 mi) around the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.\n\nAbout of the Red Line is to be built underground, with the remaining overground segment constructed in as a light rail/tram. It is to have 33 stops, 10 of which would be underground, with an average distance of 500 metres between them. The average distance between the overground stops would be 1 km. The line would run from Bat Yam in the southwest, through Jaffa and central Tel Aviv, and carry on to Petah Tikva, through Ramat Gan and Bnei Brak. An interchange is planned for Tel Aviv Central railway station. It has been forecast that by 2020, 100 million people would be using this line annually.\n\nStations (underground in \"italics\"): Nissenbaum, HaAmal, Kaf Tet BeNovember, Yoseftal, Bar Ilan, Balfour, Jabotinsky, Rothschild, HaAztmaut, Machrozet, HaBaashat, Issakov, Erlich, Ben Tzvi, Salame, Elifelet, \"Allenby\", \"Carlebach\", \"Yehudit\", \"Shaul HaMelech\", \"Arlozorov\", \"Abba Hillel\", \"Bialik\", \"Ben-Gurion\", \"Aharonowitz\". From Aharonowitz, one branch continues to Shenkar, Rabin, Beilinson, Dankner, Orlov, Pinsker, Petah Tikva Central Bus Station (Terminal); another continues to \"Em HaMoshavot\" and the Kiryat Aryeh Maintenance Depot.\n\nThe work on Allenby station began on February 8, 2015.\n\nThe second or Green Line, in the tender phase, is a line with 62 stops that would run from the west of Rishon LeZion northwards through Holon through central Tel Aviv and will split into two branches: One to Herzliya in the north, and one to Ramat HaHayal neighborhood in Tel Aviv in the northeast. Only its central Tel Aviv segment would be underground, from Levinski Street through Ibn Gabirol Street until the Yarkon River. Four of the fifty-eight stations will be underground. The expected annual passenger forecast is 65 million. NTA is including the design and boring of the Green Line's tunnels as part of Red Line's tunnels overall contract so that work on the Green Line's underground portion can commence immediately following the completion of the Red Line tunnels.\nThe preparations for the construction of this line begun on Feb 5th 2017 in Ibn Gabirol street in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe third, or , is envisaged as a line with 44 stops and will connect Sheba Hospital through Giv'at Shmuel and Kiryat Ono, and will connect Arlozorov in Tel Aviv to Yehud and Or Yehuda through Ramat Gan. This line will be over-ground for its entire route.\n\nThe sixth, or Brown Line, is a planned BRT line that will serve the southern metropolitan area, beginning in Moshe Dayan Railway Station at western Rishon LeZion in a connection with the Red Line and the Green Line, continues east via central Rishon Lezion, bypasses Assaf HaRofeh Medical Center, and continues to Ramle where it splits into two branches: One continues to Lod in the northeast, and the second continues to eastern Ramle in the east. There is a possibility of making it a light rail line eventually.\n\nThe following lines were planned but some of them are now expected to be replaced by the Tel Aviv Metro lines.\n\nThis line would have begun in Kfar Saba then continued on to Hod Hasharon, Herzliya, Ramat Hasharon on Sokolov Street, before joining Ben-Gurion Street in Ramat Gan, then Yitzhak Rabin Street in Givataim, then Moshe Dayan Street in Tel Aviv, Mikveh Israel, it would end in Holon after crossing Ariel Sharon Park. This line was designed initially as a bus rapid transit, however, currently the possibility of making it a metro line is being considered.\n\nThe fifth, or Blue Line, was the first line of the BRT system and the first line not to pass via Tel Aviv. The line would begin in Rehovot and continue to HaRishonim Railway Station in Rishon LeZion via Ness Ziona and end at the Holon junction. This line's route is part of the Tel Aviv Metro plan.\n\nThe seventh, or Pink Line, was a planned BRT line that will serve the northern metropolitan area, beginning in northeastern Kfar Saba and continues through its main streets until, crossing Highway 4 to Ra'anana and continues through Ahuza Street until western Ra'anana and continues to Herzliya and crosses it until the Marina area, where it terminates. There is an alternative service of the line through Highway 4 and Highway 2 to Tel Aviv, that splits from the main service in the Kfar Saba-Ra'anana border.\n\nThe eighth and last to date, or \"Orange Line\", is a planned BRT line that will be the only line which is isolated from the system. It will serve only the city of Netanya in the northern metropolitan area. It will be a circular line that connects both sides of the city, crossing Highway 2. Actual route of the line is still unknown. The line will be connected to the system only by other transport means, such as Israel Railways and buses.\n\n\n"}

This differs from deep veins that are far from the surface.\n\nSuperficial veins are not paired with an artery, unlike the deep veins, which typically have an artery with the same name close by.\n\nSuperficial veins are important physiologically for cooling of the body. When the body is too hot the body shunts blood from the deep veins to the superficial veins, to facilitate heat transfer to the surroundings. Superficial veins can be seen under the skin. Those below the level of the heart tend to bulge out. This can be readily witnessed in the hand: raised above the heart and the blood should drain; lowered below the heart and it will fill. Veins become more visually prominent when lifting heavy weight, especially after a period of proper strength training.\n\nPhysiologically, the superficial veins are not as important as the deep veins (as they carry less blood) and are sometimes removed in a procedure called vein stripping, which is used to treat varicose veins. \n\nThe United States Department of Health and Human Services makes the following distinction, \"Spider veins can usually be seen under the skin, but they do not make the skin bulge out like varicose veins do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2297330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297330", "title": "USS Saratoga (1780)", "text": "USS Saratoga (1780)\n\nUSS \"Saratoga\" was a sloop in the Continental Navy. She was the first ship to honor the historic Battle of Saratoga. Having disappeared in 1781, her fate remains a mystery.\n\"Saratoga\" was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Warton and Humphries. She was begun in December 1779 and launched on 10 April 1780.\n\nCommanded by Captain John Young, \"Saratoga\" departed Philadelphia on 13 August 1780 escorting the packet, \"Mercury\", which was sailing for Europe carrying Henry Laurens. The former President of the Continental Congress was planning to seek money on the European continent to finance the American government.\n\nTwo days later, the \"Saratoga\" passed frigates and in the upper Delaware Bay. Captain Young and Henry Laurens communicated with the frigates and they were to join \"Saratoga\" in a cruise as a squadron. The frigates, continued on up the Delaware River to replenish at Philadelphia.\n\nAfter waiting in vain for the frigates to return, \"Saratoga\" and \"Mercury\" passed through the Delaware Capes out to sea by themselves. Because of inadequate ballast, the \"Saratoga\" was unstable under a heavy spread of canvas and was forced to proceed much more slowly than the \"Mercury\". Thus, the \"Mercury\" was forced to heave to each night to allow the \"Saratoga\" to catch up. This schedule continued until 23 August, when Henry Laurens released the \"Saratoga\" from her escorting duty with the suggestion that she \"...make a short cruise and then return to Philadelphia...\" Afterwards, the unescorted \"Mercury\" was captured by the British off Newfoundland and Laurens was imprisoned in England.\n\nFor more than a fortnight, Captain Young operated east of the shipping lanes while he trained his crew in operating their ship and fighting her guns. On the afternoon of 9 September, a lookout spotted a sail to the northwest. By then, Young had managed to get \"Saratoga\" into fighting shape.\n\nHe headed his ship toward the unknown sail and set out in pursuit. By twilight, he was close enough to see that his quarry was a brig flying British colors. Some two hours later, \"Saratoga\" had closed within hailing distance and learned that the chase was the Royal Navy's brig, , and not about to surrender. \"Saratoga\" opened fire with a broadside and was quickly answered by \"Keppel\", opening an inconclusive, three-hour battle. During the action, due to gale force seas, coinciding with her insufficient ballast, the \"Saratoga\"s guns were unable to inflict any serious damage on \"Keppel\". After Captain Young’s repeated efforts to close to boarding distance of the \"Keppel\" and the British brig evading those efforts, and midnight approaching, Young ordered the helmsman to end the chase and head for home.\n\nThree days later, as \"Saratoga\" approached Cape Henlopen, she came upon the \"Sarah\", a British ship bound for New York laden with rum from the West Indies. The merchantman surrendered without resisting, and the two ships proceeded into the Delaware. They anchored off Chester, Pennsylvania, the following afternoon where the \"Sarah\" was promptly condemned and sold, along with her cargo, which brought the continental treasury funds desperately needed to refit the frigate, , for sea.\n\nThe \"Saratoga\" spent three days at \"Chester\", where she replenished her stores and took on additional iron for ballast before heading back down the Delaware toward the open sea and another cruise. She cleared the Delaware Capes on 18 September and sailed northward along the New Jersey coast. A week later, off the Jersey highlands, she came upon the \"Elizabeth\", which had been taken in Chesapeake Bay several weeks before by British privateer, \"Restoration\". The \"Saratoga\" captured the 60-ton American brig, and Captain Young sent the brig to Philadelphia under a prize crew.\n\n\"Saratoga\" remained in the vicinity of the Jersey highlands without encountering any further ships. Toward the end of the month, she turned south. The \"Saratoga\" cruised parallel to the coast. Captain Young constantly exercised her crew at her guns and in her rigging to sharpen their fighting capability. The crew had an opportunity to prove their seamanship when on 10 October they safely brought their ship through a storm with but superficial damage. This same storm decimated the British squadron which Admiral Rodney had sent out of New York to patrol the American coast.\n\nThat night, she turned north again. At dawn the next day, she spotted two sails far off her port bow. The \"Saratoga\" was due east of Cape Henry when she began the chase. As she closed the distance between herself and her quarry, Captain Young ordered his helmsman to head for the open water between the enemy ships which proved to be the large, 22-gun letter of marquee ship, \"Charming Molly\", and a small schooner, the \"Two Brothers\". When the \"Saratoga\" was between the two English vessels, Captain Young ordered the \"Charming Molly\" to surrender, but she refused to do so. After the \"Saratoga\" had fired a broadside into the \"Charming Molly\", a boarding party, led by Lt. Joshua Barney, leapt to the merchantman's deck and opened a fierce hand-to-hand fight which soon compelled the British captain to lower his colors.\n\nAn American prize crew under Lieutenant Barney promptly took the place of \"Charming Molly\"s British skipper, officers, and tars. Captain Young then set out after the fleeing sloop the \"Two Brothers\" which, when overtaken, surrendered without resistance. The second prize, \"Two Brothers\", promptly headed for the Delaware for libeling in Admiralty court in Philadelphia.\n\nFrom the prisoners captured on the \"Charming Molly\", Captain Young learned that she and the \"Two Brothers\" had been part of a small merchant fleet which had sailed from Jamaica and had been scattered by the recent storm. As soon as his crew had finished temporary repairs to \"Charming Molly\"s battle-damaged hull, the \"Saratoga\" began to search for the remaining merchant fleet, a ship and two brigs. About mid-day on 11 October, a lookout saw three sails slowly rise above the horizon dead ahead, and another chase began. As the \"Saratoga\" approached the strangers, Captain Young ordered his helmsman to head between the ships. As she passed between the enemy vessels, she fired both broadsides, her port guns fired at the \"Elizabeth\", and her starboard muzzles belched fire and iron at the brig \"Nancy\". The enemy's shots passed above the \"Saratoga\", causing only minor damage to her rigging while the first American salvo knocked the \"Nancy\" out of action and did substantial damage to the \"Elizabeth\", which surrendered after taking another volley. Meanwhile, the other brig raced away; and Captain Young, being busy with his two new prizes, allowed her to escape free of pursuit.\n\nThe \"Saratoga\"'s crew labored repairing the battered hulls of the prizes before sending them toward the Delaware Capes. About midnight, the \"Saratoga\" herself got underway northward. At dawn, near Cape Henlopen, a blue jacket sailor aloft reported seeing two unknown sails, one dead ahead and the other several miles off her port quarter. The first was later identified as American brig, \"Providence\" which was at that time a British prize heading for New York. The second ship was the 74-gun British ship-of-the-line, . Despite the proximity of the British man-of-war, Captain Young set out after the Providence and recaptured her after about an hour's chase. Captain Young quickly put a prize crew on board the \"Providence\" and then the \"Saratoga\" got underway for the Delaware. The \"Saratoga\" was anchored off Chester, Pennsylvania, at dawn on 14 October.\n\nOn 15 December, after being refitted at Philadelphia, the \"Saratoga\" got underway for Hispaniola to pick up a load of French military supplies which were awaiting transportation to America. New officers and men had come on board to replace those who had left the ship to man her prizes. A number of merchantmen awaited her just inside the capes hoping to be escorted to a safe offing. On the morning of 20 October, favorable weather enabled the \"Saratoga\" to put to sea escorting her 12 charges. The next afternoon, after one of the merchantmen signaled that an unknown sail had appeared, \"Saratoga\" set out to investigate. Within two hours, after seeing the British ensign flying from her mast, the \"Saratoga\" had reached within firing range and sent a warning 4-pounder shot across the stranger's bow. Instead of surrendering, the British privateer, \"Resolution\", maneuvered to attack. The ships fired at the same instant, \"Resolution\"s gunners fired high and only did superficial damage to the \"Saratoga\". The \"Saratoga\"s broadside damaged the \"Resolution\"s hull and superstructure and forced her to surrender.\n\nCaptain Young embarked the \"Resolution\"s crew in \"Saratoga\" as prisoners; and placed an American crew on the prize. The two ships then headed toward Cape Henlopen which they reached on New Year's Day, 1781. Captain Young turned his prisoners over to the Continental agent at Lewes, Delaware, and headed the \"Saratoga\" back toward the Caribbean the same day.\n\nOn the morning of 9 January 1781, off the coast of then England's loyal province of East Florida, the \"Saratoga\" captured a 20-gun letter of marquee the \"Tonyn\" in a fierce battle. The \"Tonyn\" had recently sailed from St. Augustine laden with turpentine, indigo, hides, and deerskins intended for Liverpool England.\n\nCaptain Young spent a day repairing the \"Tonyn\" and the \"Saratoga\"s rigging, then the two ships got underway on the morning of 11 January for Hispaniola. On the 16th, \"Saratoga\" captured, without resistance, an armed brig, the \"Douglas\", which was carrying wine from Madeira to Charleston, South Carolina, that important Southern port which had fallen into British hands. Captain Young sent this prize to Philadelphia.\n\nOn 27 January, the \"Saratoga\" and the \"Tonyn\" reached Cap-Français where Captain Young turned the \"Tonyn\" over to the French Admiralty court and arranged to have \"Saratoga\" docked to have her hull scraped and coated with pitch while awaiting the arrival of military cargo and French frigates to assist in convoying a fleet of Allied merchantmen. The governor of the French colony of Saint Dominique suggested that the \"Saratoga\" join her sister Continental frigates, the and the \"Confederacy\", an American privateer, the \"Fair American\", and a French naval brig, \"Cat\", in a cruise through the Windward Passage to Jamaica. The little fleet departed Cap-Français on 20 February and returned eight days later with a British ship the \"Diamond\", which they had captured as she approached Jamaica laden with plunder taken by the British during Admiral Rodney's conquest of the Dutch Island, St. Eustatius.\n\nBy mid-March, all was ready. The French warships were on hand; the Continental warships were loaded, and 29 heavily laden merchant ships were in the harbor awaiting escorts. The convoy left from Cap-Français on the 15th, the ides of March. Three days later on 18 March, a lookout high over the \"Saratoga\"s deck reported two sails far off to westward, the \"Saratoga\" left the convoy in pursuit of the strangers. About mid-afternoon, she caught up with one of the fleeing ships which surrendered without a fight. Captain Young placed an American crew on board the prize and got underway after the second ship. Midshipman Penfield, commander of the prize crew, later reported that as he was supervising his men's efforts to follow the \"Saratoga\", the wind suddenly rose to fearful velocity and almost capsized his ship. When he had managed to get the snow-rigged merchantman back under control, he looked up and was horrified to learn that the \"Saratoga\" had vanished. After numerous successful victories and prizes, \"Saratoga\" disappeared, lost at sea. The \"Saratoga\"s fate remains a mystery.\n"}

The airport is owned by the Salina Airport Authority. It is primarily used for general aviation operations, with service by one passenger airline, SkyWest Airlines (operating as United Express), subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.\n\nSalina Regional Airport is the home of the Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus Aviation Program with degrees available in Airport Management, Aviation Certificates, Aviation Electronics, Aviation Maintenance Management, Aviation Safety, Professional Pilot, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Design and Integration, and Unmanned Aircraft Systems Flight and Operations.\n\nThe airport is on the site of the former Schilling Air Force Base (previously known as Smoky Hill Army Air Field and Smoky Hill Air Force Base).\n\nThe construction of military airfields after the Pearl Harbor Attack that caused the entry of the United States into World War II resulted in the construction of the Smoky Hill Army Air Field (AAF) on , southwest of Salina, Kansas. The first unit associated with the airfield was the 376th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, whose engineers first laid out the base in April 1942. Construction began in May 1942 with the aid of nearly 7,000 construction workers. The airfield was officially activated on 1 September 1942 and was assigned to the II Bomber Command, Second Air Force.\n\nEnough construction was completed that the 376th moved into facilities on 10 September. The first aircraft to arrive, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, arrived later that month and were assigned to the 346th Bombardment Group. The mission of Smoky Hill AAF was that of a Second Phase Heavy Bomber Operational Training Unit (OTU). Combat groups formed in First Phase training were reassigned to the airfield, training focused to teamwork of the combat crew was stressed: bombing, gunnery, and instrument flight missions were performed by full crews. Upon completion, the groups moved on to third phase the final level of training before overseas deployment to the combat theaters.\n\nThe 366th was joined by the 400th Bombardment Group in the training mission at Smoky Hill AAF on 31 July 1943. The 366th concentrated on B-17 Flying Fortress training; the 400th on B-24 Liberator training.\n\nThe airport was the takeoff and landing point for the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, flown by Steve Fossett in the first nonstop, non-refueled solo circumnavigation of the earth from February 28 to March 3, 2005. Fossett's later nonstop non-refueled solo circumnavigation in the GlobalFlyer was also Salina to Salina, from March 14 to March 17, 2006, setting a new record for greatest distance traveled on a closed course.\n\nSalina Regional Airport has memorialized the records set by Steve Fossett with Fossett Plaza. The plaza features a memorial, seating area, plaques with the story of the Global Flyer and Steve Fossett, and a viewing area to observe the many flight operations at the airport.\n\nThe airport used to be served by Great Lakes Airlines under the Essential Air Service program, however currently it is served by United Express.\n\nSalina Regional Airport covers 2,862 acres (1,158 ha) at an elevation of 1,288 feet (393 m) above mean sea level. It has four asphalt runways: 17/35 is 12,300 by 150 feet (3,749 x 46 m); 12/30 is 6,510 by 100 feet (1,984 x 30 m); 18/36 is 4,301 by 75 feet (1,311 x 23 m); 4/22 is 3,648 by 75 feet (1,112 x 23 m).\n\nIn the year ending January 30, 2014 the airport had 91,101 aircraft operations from general aviation, air taxi, military, and scheduled commercial.\n\nPossessed of such a long runway and located approximately 85 miles southeast from the continental center of the United States, many corporate and private jets stop at this airport to refuel and allow passengers to have a break, earning Salina the moniker \"America's Fuel Stop.\" Avflight Salina is responsible for all fueling and ground handling of transient and military aircraft.\n\nThe airport also hosts a variety of Forward Operating Location (FOL) activity and has been the operating site for many missions by NASA, NOAA, Wings of Freedom, the Commemorative Air Force and Virgin Atlantic Global.\n\nA report from the 40th Bombardment Wing in 1953 described the problem. \"One of the foremost and the first problems encountered was an excessive amount of solvent being required to properly wash and clean aircraft,\" the report said. \"Some method of reducing the amount of solvent used was needed. This problem was met by installing a system of settling tanks ... Approximately 12,000 to 14,000 gallons of solvent are used per month.\"\n\nIn 1989, the Salina School District unearthed three of 107 underground fuel storage tanks on its vo-tech property. It first became known that Trichlorethylene (TCE), a degreaser used to clean aircraft and a carcinogen, as well as other compounds disposed of on the former base, have migrated into the soil and groundwater, forming a toxic plume. In 1999, the US Army Corps of Engineers published its first remedial investigation.\nIn 2005, the Corps shared the draft of a second remedial investigation of the contamination in the Salina Airport Industrial Area. Residents in the area of the plume were advised not to drink the water, per the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Soilwater intrusion assays in 1999 by EPA and again in 2005 showed vapor levels inside Kansas State University's Tullis building did not exceed state standards for air quality, but they may exceed federal EPA guidelines. As of 2005, the federal government had spent more than $17 million studying the problem in its jurisdiction. In December 2007 the Corps groundwater contamination cleanup was put on hold. In August 2008, the city of Salina offered to clean-up former Schilling AFB, as suggested by the Corps.\nIn 2010, after the plume had reached residential areas near the former base, Salina officials, the Salina Airport Authority, the Salina school district and Kansas State University – Salina (now Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus), who own 96% of the property filed a federal lawsuit in Kansas City, Kansas, for the clean up costs. In spring of 2013 the Department of Justice signed a settlement that the government would pay $8.4 million merely toward developing the plan to clean up the former base. A remedial investigation, feasibility study and cleanup remedy were estimated to cost about $9.3 million, of which the Salina public entities agreed to pay $936,300. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment oversees the cleanup process. As of September 2015 studies have continued to find groundwater contamination in soil and bedrock, and no concentrations of vapor requiring immediate action were found in an area around Salina Regional Airport.\n\n"}

{"id": "2297349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297349", "title": "Ichigo Kurosaki", "text": "Ichigo Kurosaki\n\nKubo said that Ichigo was created to replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn't suited for the role. His character has been well received among both readers and reviewers. Ichigo is often featured in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" character popularity polls. He was consistently ranked as the most popular character in \"Bleach\". The 2007 Japanese \"Newtype\" magazine polls ranked Ichigo as one of the top 100 most-loved anime characters. Reviewers of the series have praised his personality, though some consider him to be a stereotypical anti-hero. Merchandise based on Ichigo's likeness has been released, including toys, clothing and action figures. In the animated adaptations of \"Bleach\", Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese. In the English adaptations, he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. In the live-action film, he is played by Sota Fukushi.\n\nWhen drawing the manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first \"Bleach\" character he introduced, was originally intended to be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having dark hair and softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch. While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile.\n\nKubo has stated that Ichigo's greatest strength is his considerate and thoughtful nature; he always thinks about other's needs. However, he also noted it as his greatest weakness, since worrying about his friends tends to put him in danger. When asked in an interview if he had any plans to focus on the love triangle between Ichigo, Orihime, and Rukia, Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it as he didn't want to focus on romance. Kubo attributes Ichigo's popularity among readers to the fact that he \"looks cool\". He also mentioned that as people read more about him they will discover that he is a warm and kind-hearted person.\n\nFollowing over fifty volumes of the manga's released, Kubo believes that Ichigo was the most developed character. He said that Ichigo leads the story and introduces readers to the events in it. When the Arrancar arc ended, Kubo rebooted the series which resulted in Ichigo losing his Soul Reaper powers. In the same way Ichigo became a Soul Reaper during the series' first chapter; he starts searching for methods to recover his original powers.\n\nIchigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in the Japanese anime, while as a child he is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka. Morita said that Ichigo was one of his favorite characters he ever played alongside Tidus from \"Final Fantasy X\". Johnny Yong Bosch voices him in the English dub as a teenager, and Mona Marshall as a kid. While describing Ichigo as one of his best roles, Morita notes that voicing him can be at times difficult. Bosch has enjoyed voicing Ichigo's character due to his personal interest in the character's morals. However, he experienced difficulty voicing him in some scenes where Ichigo shouts for a long time.\n\nSota Fukushi portrays Ichigo in the live-action adaptation of the series which adapts the storyline's first arc, with Johnny Yong Bosch reprising\nhis role in the film's English dub.\n\nIchigo is one of the teenagers attending Karakura High School and having the ability to see ghosts. He meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki from a secret organization called the Soul Society who are in charge of sending souls to the afterlife. At the same time, Ichigo's family is attacked by a Hollow, a deceased spirit that became a warped soul-eating monster which Soul Reapers deal with. After being wounded in an attempt to shield Ichigo from a Hollow attack, Rukia transmits her Soul Reaper powers to him so he can save his family. In following months, Ichigo acts in Rukia's place as the Soul Reaper in protecting Karakura Town from Hollows as their friendship continues to bloom. Ichigo's past is also revealed as he faces the Grand Fisher, a hollow who killed his mother when he was nine years old. In time, the Soul Society sends two high-seated officers to take Rukia back for committing the crime of transferring her Soul Reaper powers to a human. In training with Kisuke Urahara in order to rescue Rukia, Ichigo obtains his own Soul Reaper powers and learns the name of his Zanpakutō, . In his search for Rukia, Ichigo is confronted by members of Gotei 13, the main military force in the Soul Society. As he approaches the prison where Rukia is being held captive, Ichigo does battle with, faces and defeats enemy Soul Reapers including Renji Abarai, Kenpachi Zaraki, Byakuya Kuchiki, who adopted Rukia as his sister. For his match against Byakuya, Ichigo learns his \"Bankai\", , which highly increases his speed. After a long fight, he defeats Byakuya, who confesses why he tried to kill his sister. Captain Sōsuke Aizen, who faked his death prior, have been behind Rukia's sentencing and the chaos that plagued the Soul Society. He flees to Hollows' realm of Hueco Mundo before the other Soul Reapers can apprehend him.\nIn time, Aizen begins targeting Karakura Town with an army of Arrancars, Hollows that assumed human form with Soul Reaper powers, after subjecting them to the Hōgyoku. In order to defeat the Arrancars and to control his Hollow powers, Ichigo begins his training with the group of Soul Reaper outcasts known as the Vizard. During the Arrancar's attack on Karakura Town, Ichigo's friend Orihime Inoue has been abducted by Ulquiorra Cifer of the Aizen's strongest Arrancars: The Espadas. When the Soul Society refuses to help save Orihime, Ichigo and his friends go to Hueco Mundo to rescue her. In Hueco Mundo, after defeating the Espada Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez, Ichigo manages to save Orihime and defeat Ulquiorra. Soon after, Ichigo returns from Hueco Mundo to Karakura Town, and confront Aizen. During the battles interim, Ichigo learns a technique called the that weakens and defeats Aizen, allowing Urahara to seal him within a kidō barrier, at the expense of Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers.\n\nSeventeen months later, Ichigo becomes a senior in high school. The start of the Lost Agent arc describes Ichigo's life after he loses his Soul Reaper powers. One day, he meets Kūgo Ginjō, a Fullbringer from the group Xcution. Ginjo offers to replenish Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers in return for helping him and his group to become ordinary humans. With their help, Ichigo unlocks his own Fullbring powers through his Substitute Soul Reaper Badge. However, Ichigo later learns that Ginjo and his ally Shūkurō Tsukishima, a Fullbringer with ability to change people's memories, used him to take Fullbring powers for Xcution's use. Luckily, Rukia transfers the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami through a special sword and restores Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo fights Ginjo with his improved Shinigami powers and during their duel, it is revealed that Ginjo was the first Substitute Soul Reaper. Despite learning the truth, Ichigo resolves to protect everyone (something about him which Rukia notes has never changed) and kill Ginjo, which he does after a prolonged fight. Though learning from Ginjō that the Soul Society monitor and limit their powers, Ichigo tells the Court Squad that he will continue to fight by their side as he asks for their consent to bury Ginjō.\n\nWhile patrolling Karakura Town, Ichigo is informed about invasion of Hueco Mundo by Wandenreich, a group of Quincies. He goes to Hueco Mundo with his friends to liberate it from one of the Wandenreich's high-ranked officers Quilge Opie. After dealing with Opie, Ichigo finds out that the Quincies are attacking the Soul Society. Arriving just after Head Captain Yamamoto's death, Ichigo encounters the Wandenreich's leader Yhwach. At the end of the encounter, which ends in a draw, Ichigo learns his mother was a Quincy. During the fight, Ichigo's \"Zanpakutō\" is shattered while attempting to stop Yhwach from escaping. Ichigo goes back to the World of Living where he learns the truth that his mother was a Quincy who was on a verge of hollowification until she was saved by Isshin at the cost of his Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo later learns that entity he believed to be Zangetsu is actually the embodiment of his Quincy powers yet accept him as he gains his reforged Zanpakutō in its new split \"Shikai\" form. During the second invasion by the Wandenreich, Ichigo and his friends confront Yhwach at the Soul King's Palace. During the prolonged fight that followed, Ichigo is defeated by Yhwach. With help from new allies, Ichigo faces Yhwach once again and slices him in two after getting help from the now free Aizen.\n\nAs revealed in the light novel \"Bleach: Can't Fear Your Own World\", Ichigo was a potential heir of the Spirit King due to the nature of his origins and was sparred the burden when a new Soul King was created from Yhwach's remains. The manga's epilogue, taking place ten years after Yhwach's defeat, depicts Ichigo and Orihime with a son named Kazui, who destroys the remnants of Yhwach's power.\n\nIchigo appears in each films for the series, including \"\"; \"\"; \"\" and \"\". He also appears in both of the original video animations; fighting against a Hollow called the Grand Fisher in the first one and combating the rogue Soul Reaper Baishin in the second. In the \"Bleach\" video games, Ichigo is a playable character, including the and series. In some games, his Hollow form and \"Bankai\" state are available as separate characters. In \"Rock Musical Bleach\", a musical based on the \"Bleach\" series, Ichigo is played by Tatsuya Isaka. His character is featured in two volumes from the \"Bleach Beat Collection\" CD soundtrack series which features themes composed by his Japanese voice actor, Masakazu Morita. These include the first of them, in which he is the only character and the fourth season's fourth volume along with Rukia. Ichigo also appears in the first volume of \"Bleach Breathless Collection\" CD soundtrack series together with the embodiment of his Quincy powers that posed as the Zanpakutō spirit Zangetsu.\n\nAmongst the \"Bleach\" reader base, Ichigo has been always highly ranked in the \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" popularity polls for the series. He has usually taken first place, though in early 2008 he dropped to third. His sword, Zangetsu, also ranked third in the \"Zanpakutō\" popularity polls. In the 2007 Japanese \"Newtype\" magazine poll, Ichigo was ranked one of the best male anime characters. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA), Ichigo was elected for the best anime male character in 2008. The Japanese music distributor \"Recochoku\" has made two annual survey of which anime characters that people would like to marry. Ichigo ranked tenth in the category \"The Character I Want to Be My Groom\" from the 2008 survey and eight in the 2009 poll. Wizard Entertainment considered Ichigo the best hero from 2007, commenting that he doesn't try to be a typical hero but he fights in order to protect his friends. He was also 20th in IGN's \"Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time\" with comments focused on his design and personality. Ichigo has also appeared twice in the Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters. At the first Seiyu Awards in March 2007, Masakazu Morita won in the category \"Best Rookie Actor\" for his role as Ichigo Kurosaki. Ichigo's voice actor in the English adaptation, Johnny Yong Bosch, has also been praised for his voice work on Ichigo's character by Anime News Network (ANN), which favorably compared Bosch and Morita's work. Various merchandise based on Ichigo's appearance has been created, including action figures, plush toys and key-chains. Since the series was released, replica models of Ichigo's \"Zanpakutō\" and \"Bankai\" have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans.\n\nSeveral publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Ichigo's character. ANN's Melissa Harper commented that Ichigo's initial rebellious actions make him almost a stereotypical anti-hero, but note that he is soon revealed to be a more complex character with a sad past. \"Los Angeles Times\"s Charles Solomon comments Ichigo's character has little in common with protagonists from other series due to his bad temper and how he tends to fight. However, he added that readers from the series still \"love\" Ichigo. The way Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper was found to be relatively common by Carlos Alexandre. He noted that Ichigo's character of a \"tough guy with a heart of gold\" had already been done in several series. Charles White from IGN praised Ichigo's climactic fight against Byakuya Kuchiki as one of the best fights in the \"Bleach\" series, and later Ramsey Isler gave additional praise to both the design and voice acting for Ichigo's inner Hollow. Ichigo's development during the Rescue arc in which he sets to save Rukia Kuchiki from being executed have been praised by ANN's Theron Martin. He praised the scenes in which Ichigo manages to stop Rukia's execution and his subsequent demonstration of his \"Bankai\" as one of the \"eminently satisfying landmark moments in the series\". Wired News's Corrina Lawson stated that she liked Ichigo's strong sense of responsibility, and commented it was one of the reasons of the series' popularity.\n\nDuring the serialization of the manga, Tite Kubo said he received a letter from a reader who decided to name his son \"Ichigo\". This brought joy as well as fear to the manga artist due to how his work influenced other people. While feeling that he also made a good manga during this comment, Kubo decided to work more on the character in hopes that once the real Ichigo grows up, he would feel proud with his name.\n\n"}

An intelligence officer and linguist during the Vietnam War, he was awarded the Bronze Star and Air Medal in 1970. In 1971 he began teaching English at Union 32 High School in East Montpelier, Vermont, where he taught specialized classes in journalism and expository writing at an advanced level, and worked for the \"Christian Science Monitor\" between 1987 and 1997. As of 2009, he has been published by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. He now lives in New York City.\n\nDanziger lampooned the George W. Bush administration in many of his cartoons, some of which are collected in the anthologies \"Wreckage Begins with 'W\"' and \"Blood, Debt and Fears.\" In an interview with \"The Comics Journal\", Danziger said, \"Keep in mind that I agree with a great many things that the Republicans have been traditionally for. I am in favor of a solid economy. I am in favor of a strong dollar. I am in favor of looking after troops. I am in favor of maintaining a strong army, and I am in favor of the ability to go into business and make a profit and not pay taxes for silly purposes.\"\n\nIn addition to his editorial cartoons, he also created the comic strip \"McGonigle of the Chronicle\" (distributed by the Field Newspaper Syndicate), which ran from 1983 to 1985 in newspapers across the country, and a weekly series, \"The Teeds: Tales of Agriculture for the Young and Old\" that continues to run in Vermont newspapers.

{"id": "2297370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297370", "title": "Logos Foundation (Australia)", "text": "Logos Foundation (Australia)\n\nLogos Foundation was an influential and controversial Christian ministry that flourished in Australia in the 1970s and 1980s, under the leadership of Howard Carter, originally a Baptist pastor from Auckland, New Zealand. Logos Foundation was initially a trans-denominational charismatic teaching ministry, and primarily Protestant but with some ties with Catholic lay groups and individuals.\n\nLogos Foundation was Reconstructionist, Restorationist, and Dominionist in its theology and works.\n\nIt was established by Paul Collins in New Zealand as a trans-denominational teaching ministry serving the Charismatic Renewal through publishing the Logos Magazine. Paul Collins moved it to Sydney, Australia, c.1969, where it also facilitated large trans-denominational renewal conferences in venues such as Sydney Town Hall and the Wentworth Hotel. It was transferred to Howard Carter's leadership, relocating to Hazelbrook, lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales for a few years, and in the mid-1970s to Blackheath, upper Blue Mountains. During these years the teaching ministry attracted like-minded fellowships and home groups into loose association with it.\n\nPublishing became a significant operation, distributing charismatic themed and Restorationist teachings focused on Christian maturity and Christ's pre-eminence in short books and the monthly Logos/Restore Magazine (associated with New Wine Magazine, USA). It held annual weeklong conferences of over 1,000 registrants, featuring international charismatic speakers, including Derek Prince, Ern Baxter, Don Basham, Charles Simpson, Bob Mumford, Kevin Conner (Australia), Peter Morrow (New Zealand) and others.\n\nA Bible College was also established nearby at Westwood Lodge, Mount Victoria. At the main site in Blackheath a Christian K-12 school, Mountains Christian Academy was established which was a forerunner of more widespread Christian independent schools and home schooling as a hallmark of the movement. It carried over the Old Covenant practice of tithing (to the local church), and expected regular sacrificial giving beyond this.\n\nTheologically it taught orthodox Christian core beliefs - however in matters of opinion Logos teaching was presented as authoritative and alternative views were discouraged. Those who questioned this teaching tended to leave the movement eventually. Over time, a strong cult-like culture of group conformity developed and those who dared to question were quickly brought into line by other members with automated responses shrouded in spiritualised expression. In some instances the leadership engaged in bullying-type behavior to enforce unquestioning compliance. The group viewed itself as separate from 'the world' and any alternative views and even other expressions, denominations or interpretations of Christianity were regarded at best as suspect but mostly as false.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s a hierarchical ecclesiology was adopted in the form of the Shepherding Movement's whole-of-life discipleship of members by personal pastors (usually their \"cell group\" leader), who in turn were accountable also to their personal pastors. Followers were informed that even their leader, Howard Carter, related as a disciple to the apostolic group in Christian Growth Ministries of Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson, Ern Baxter, Derek Prince, and Don Basham, in Ft Lauderdale, USA (whose network was estimated to have approx. 150,000 people involved at its peak c.1985). Howard Carter's primary pastoral relationship was with Ern Baxter, a pioneer of the Healing Revival of the 1950s and the Charismatic Renewal of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Written covenants of submission to the individual church pastors were encouraged for the members of one representative church, Christian Faith Centre (Sydney), and were said to be common practice throughout the movement at the time.\n\nIn 1980 the Logos movement churches adopted the name, Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities (AFoCC), and were led through an eschatological shift in the early 1980s from the pre-millennialism of many Pentecostals (described as a theology of defeat), to the post-millennialism of the Presbyterian Reconstructionist theonomists (described as a theology of victory). A shift to an overt theological-political paradigm resulted in some senior leadership, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre Sydney, leaving the movement altogether. In the mid-1980s AFoCC re-branded yet again as the Covenant Evangelical Church (not associated with the Evangelical Covenant Church in the USA). The Logos Foundation brand name continued as the educational, commercial and political arm of the Covenant Evangelical Church.\n\nIt moved for the final time in 1986 to Toowoomba, Queensland where there were already associated fellowships and a demographic environment highly conducive to the growth of extreme right-wing religio-political movements. This fertile ground saw the movement peak in a short time, reaching a local support base of upwards of 2000 people.\n\nThe move to Toowoomba involved much preparation, including members selling homes and other assets in New South Wales and the Logos Foundation acquiring many homes, businesses and commercial properties in Toowoomba and the Darling Downs.\n\nIn the process of relocating the organisation and most of its members, it absorbed a number of other small Christian Churches in Toowoomba. Some of these were house churches/groups more or less affiliated with Carter's other organisations. Carter and some of his followers attempted to make links with Queensland Premier Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, a known Christian conservative, in order to further their goals.\n\nCarter continued to lead the shift in eschatology to post-millennialism and prominently religio-political in nature. More of his leadership team left the movement as Carter's style became more authoritarian and cultish. Colin Shaw was a key member at this time, who believed that Pastor Howard Carter was an \"anointed man of God\" and Shaw later became the \"right-hand\" man of Carter in his \"outreach and missionary works\" in Quezon City, Philippines. Logos used this Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church) as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Colin Shaw coordinated and sponsored under the Christian Renewal Centre's name, conferences featuring Carter. Many poorly educated and sincere Filipino pastors and locals, usually from small churches were influenced to support the wider Logos movement and to tithe from their limited funds into it. However, soon after the revelation of Howard Carter's scandalous immorality and corrupt lifestyle broke, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and dispersed back into established local churches. Colin Shaw was said to abandon the Shepherding movement at this time and engaged in soul searching and self exile for a time, fueled by severe guilt over the way these Filipino Christians were manipulated.\n\nIn 1989 Logos controversially involved itself in the Queensland State election, running a campaign of surveys and full-page newspaper advertisements promoting the line that candidates' adherence to Christian principles and biblical ethics was more important than the widespread corruption in the Queensland government that had been revealed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Published advertisements in the Courier-Mail at the time promoted strongly conservative positions in opposition to pornography, homosexuality and abortion, and a return to the death penalty. Some supporters controversially advocated Old Testament laws and penalties. This action backfired sensationally, with many mainstream Churches, community leaders and religious organisations distancing themselves from the Logos Foundation after making public statements denouncing them. At times the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law. The Sydney Morning Herald later described part of this campaign when they published, \"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern.\" The same article quoted Carter from a letter he had written to supporters at the time, \"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also\". These views were not new. An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of such people, who stated \"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\".\n\nAlthough similar behaviours existed prior, these last years in Queensland saw Logos Foundation develop cult-like tendencies. This authoritarian environment degenerated into a perverse and unbiblical abuse of power. Obedience and unhealthy submission to human leaders was cultish in many ways and the concept of submission for the purpose of 'spiritual covering' became a dominant theme in their teaching. This idea of spiritual covering soon perverted into a system of overt abuse of power over people's lives. This occurred despite opposition to the Shepherding movement from respected evangelical and Pentecostal leaders in the United States beginning as early as 1975. However, in Australia, through the Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church, this movement flourished beyond the time that it had effectively entered a period of decline in North America. Followers in Australia, were effectively quarantined by Carter from the truth of what had begun to play out in the U.S.A.\n\nThe movement had ties to a number of other groups including World MAP (Ralph Mahoney), California; Christian Growth Ministries, Fort Lauderdale; and Rousas Rushdoony, the father of Christian Reconstructionism in the United States. Activities included printing, publishing, conferencing, home schooling and ministry training. Logos Foundation (Australia) and these other organizations at times issued theological qualifications and other apparently academic degrees, master's degrees and doctorates following no formal process of study or recognized rigour, often under a range of dubious names that included the word \"University\". Carter conferred on himself a Master of Arts degree in 1987 which was apparently issued by the Pacific College Theological. Visiting preachers from the United States were frequently gifted such 'qualifications' by Carter including a PhD purportedly issued by the \"University of Oceania Sancto Spiritus\". The recipient thereafter used the title of \"Doctor\" in his itinerant preaching and revival ministry throughout North America.\n\nThe Shepherding movement worldwide descended into a cultish movement characterized by manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements. It had been an attempt by mostly sincere people, to free Christianity of the entrenched reductions of traditional and consumerist religion. However, with its emphasis on authority and submissive accountability, the movement was open to abuse. This, combined with spiritual hunger, an early measure of success and growth, mixed motives, and the inexperience of new leaders all coalesced to form a dangerous and volatile mix. Howard Carter played these factors skillfully to entrench his own position.\n\nThe Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church did not survive long the scandal of Howard Carter's standing down and public exposure of adultery in 1990. Hey (2010) has stated in his thesis, \"Suggested reasons for Carter's failure have included insecurity, an inability to open up to others, arrogance and over confidence in his own ability\". Like many modern evangelists and mega-church leaders, he was placed on a pedestal by the movement's followers. This environment where the leader was not subject to true accountability, allowed his deception and double life to flourish unknown for many years. In the years immediately prior to this scandal, those who dared to question were quickly derided by other members or even disciplined, thus reinforcing a very unhealthy environment. When the scandal of Carter's immorality was revealed, full details of the lavish lifestyle to which he had become accustomed were also exposed. Carter's frequent travel to North America was lavish and extravagant, utilizing first class flights and five-star hotels. The full financial affairs of the organization prior to the collapse were highly secretive. Most members had been unaware of how vast sums of money involved in the whole operation were being channelled nor were they aware of how the leaders' access to these funds were being managed.\n\nA significant number of quite senior ex-Logos members found acceptance in the now defunct Rangeville Uniting Church. The congregation of the Rangeville Uniting Church left the Uniting Church to become an independent congregation known as the Rangeville Community Church. Prior to the Rangeville Uniting Church closing an earlier split resulted in a significant percentage of the total congregation contributing to the formation of the Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba.\n\n"}

This direct sequel to \"Getter Robo\" was broadcast on Fuji TV from May 15, 1975 to March 25, 1976, with a total of 39 episodes (some episodes were rebroadcast, erroneously giving the impression that there were 43 episodes).\n\nMattel's popular Shogun Warriors toy collection included Getter Robo G's robot formations in that toy line: Getter Dragon (Dragun), Getter Liger (Raider), and Getter Poseidon (Poseidon). As a result of the popularity of these toys in the US, Jim Terry included this series in his Force Five anime lineup under the title of Starvengers. Some Starvengers episodes were re-dubbed and released by FB Productions under the Robo Formers title. The original \"Getter Robo\" series, however, has yet to appear in the U.S. (although the Shin Getter Robo OVAs have appeared). In the UK, Starvengers episodes were released on video by Krypton Force under the name Formators.\n\nAfter the final defeat of the Dinosaur Empire and the death of Musashi Tomoe in the original Getter Robo series, Dr. Saotome (Dr. Copernicus in \"Starvengers\"), creator of Getter Robo, fears that the peace the Getter Robo team has won will be short lived and that even greater enemies will appear. Dr. Saotome's fears are justified when the Hundred Demon Empire (Hyakki Teikoku, also known as the Pandemonium Empire in \"Starvengers\") appears. Composed of horned, devil-like alien humanoids and possessing a technology advanced enough to build giant demonic robots, this militaristic organization intends to steal Saotome's Getter Generator to fulfill their own goals of world domination.\n\nHowever, Dr. Saotome is prepared with the creation of an even more powerful Getter Robo, Getter Robo G and a new Getter Robo base. Also, with Musashi dead, Dr. Saotome needs a third pilot, which he finds in baseball player Benkei Kuruma.\n\nLike its predecessor, Getter Robo G is composed of three jet-like vehicles piloted by one of the three pilots. Dragon is the red jet, controlled by the pilot of Getter Dragon. Liger, the blue jet, is used by Getter Liger's pilot. Getter Poseidon's operator uses Poseidon, the yellow machine. All three are armed with missiles but are generally very weak and never used in combat unless absolutely necessary. They also appear when the pilots use the Open Get (Break Formation in the English Version) verbal command to break up the current form, so that they can change into another, or so they can dodge an enemy's attack.\n\n\nMecha Oni are the monsters of the week that appear much like the mechasauruses in the first series. It is stated and proven in a few episodes that destroying their horns will critically weaken, if not destroy, a Mecha Oni. Most Mecha Oni take up the likeness of their pilots, primarily in the head, with a few exceptions.\n"}

It originates on the medial (ulnar) side of the dorsal venous network of the hand and travels up the base of the forearm, where its course is generally visible through the skin as it travels in the subcutaneous fat and fascia lying superficial to the muscles.\n\nNear the region anterior to the cubital fossa, in the bend of the elbow joint, the basilic vein usually connects with the other large superficial vein of the upper extremity, the cephalic vein, via the median cubital vein (or median basilic vein). The layout of superficial veins in the forearm is highly variable from person to person, and there is a profuse network of unnamed superficial veins that the basilic vein communicates with.\n\nAs it ascends the medial side of the biceps in the arm proper (between the elbow and shoulder), the basilic vein normally perforates the brachial fascia (deep fascia) above the medial epicondyle, or even as high as mid-arm. There, around the lower border of the teres major muscle, the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral veins feed into it, just before it joins the brachial veins to form the axillary vein.\n\nAlong with other superficial veins in the forearm, the basilic vein is an acceptable site for venipuncture. Nevertheless, IV nurses sometimes refer to the basilic vein as the \"virgin vein\", since with the arm typically supinated during phlebotomy the basilic vein below the elbow becomes awkward to access, and is therefore infrequently used.\n\nVascular surgeons sometimes utilize the basilic vein to create an AV (arteriovenous) fistula or AV graft for hemodialysis access in patients with kidney failure.\n\n\n"}

Produced by Ben Schwalb and directed by Edward Bernds, it stars Zsa Zsa Gabor, Eric Fleming, and Laurie Mitchell. The screenplay by Charles Beaumont, about a revolt against a cruel Venusian queen, is based on an idea supplied by Ben Hecht and originally titled Queen of the Universe. Upon its release, the film was promoted by Allied Artists and distributed to some locations as part of a double feature with \"Frankenstein 1970\" starring Boris Karloff.\n\nIn 1985, Captain Patterson (Eric Fleming) and his space crew (Dave Willock, Patrick Waltz and Paul Birch) take a rocket to a space station near Earth. En route, however, the space station is destroyed by an interstellar energy beam which also affects their rocketship. The space crew crash land on Venus and are captured. They learn the planet is under the dictatorship of the cruel Queen Yllana (Laurie Mitchell), a masked woman who has most men killed, keeping only mathematicians and scientists on a prison colony moon which orbits Venus. In the palace, the astronauts are aided by a beautiful courtier named Talleah (Zsa Zsa Gabor) and her friends (Lisa Davis, Barbara Darrow and Marilyn Buferd). The women long for the love of men again and plot to overthrow the evil queen to reestablish the \"old order\". \n\nOnce Patterson is alone with the queen in her bedchamber, he has the opportunity to remove her mask, revealing that her face is horribly disfigured due to radiation burns caused by men during a war between Venus and another planet \"10 Earth years ago\". Later, in a fury, the queen decides to destroy Earth to protect her world and to preserve her own power. In the presence of her armed guards, Talleah and the crewmen can only watch as she aims the energy-beam \"disintegrator\" at Earth. Just after the queen activates the weapon, Talleah's allies arrive. As a large struggle ensues, the disintegrator begins to malfunction, explodes, and the queen dies. Talleah is now the new leader of Venus and at a subsequent ceremony announces that Patterson's rocket has been repaired and he and his crew can return to Earth. Talleah's technicians have also repaired the \"electronic televiewer\", which allows space command on Earth to contact Patterson. Command orders him not to attempt a return home but to remain on Venus for at least a year, until a relief expedition can arrive. Although the crew could return to Earth in their repaired ship, they are elated to follow orders and stay. The film ends with the men and Venusians celebrating in a flurry of hugs and passionate kisses.\n\nAlso included in the cast are Guy Prescott as Colonel Ramsey (uncredited), Gerry Gaylor as base commander, Ralph Gamble as officer in anteroom (uncredited) and Joi Lansing as an astronaut's girlfriend (uncredited). Venusians are played by Tania Velia, Norma Young, Marjorie Durant, Brandy Bryan, Ruth Lewis, June McCall, and Marilyn Buferd, who was a former Miss America (1946). This was Buferd's final role in her decade-plus film career.\n\nThe Three Stooges and the Bowery Boys director Edward Bernds recalled that, after famed producer Walter Wanger was released from prison for shooting agent Jennings Lang in the groin for having an affair with his wife Joan Bennett, Wanger could only find work at the low-rent Allied Artists (formerly Monogram Pictures). In 1952, Wanger brought a ten-page idea for a screenplay by Ben Hecht called Queen of the Universe that was a satirical look at a planet run by women. Several years later, with the idea of science fiction films being more common, Allied Artists revived the project with Wanger replaced on the film by Ben Schwalb, who was then producing the Bowery Boys films. Screenwriter Charles Beaumont did not think there was much in the Hecht screenplay, but Schwalb suggested spoofing the idea and had former Three Stooges screenwriter Ellwood Ullman touch up Beaumont's screenplay. Allied Artists retitled the film \"Queen of Outer Space\" as they thought the original title sounded more like a beauty pageant.\n\nThe central plot of a planet ruled by women was recycled from other science fiction productions of the era, including \"Abbott and Costello Go to Mars\" (1953), \"Cat-Women of the Moon\" (1953), and the British feature \"Fire Maidens from Outer Space\" (1955). \"Queen of Outer Space\" also recycled many props, costumes, and other elements used in earlier films of the 1950s, most prominently the C-57D crewmen's uniforms and Altaira's wardrobe from \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956); models, sets, and special effects from Bernds' \"World Without End\" (1956); stock footage of an Atlas missile taking off; and a model rocketship built for \"Flight to Mars\" (1951). The model was used as well by the Bowery Boys in \"Paris Playboys\" (1954), which was co-written by Bernds and Ullman. It is noteworthy too tha the queen's guards wore uniforms that foreshadow (and may have influenced) those worn on the later \"\" television series, coming in the same three Starfleet colors; red, blue, and gold.\n\nIn her 1991 autobiography \"One Lifetime is Not Enough\", Gabor recounts a memorable line of her dialogue in the film and cites the production costs for creating the highly tailored fashions worn by her character:\n\nIn 1958, the film received generally positive reviews from critics in major newspapers and in trade publications. Most reviewers, including Charles Stinson of the \"Los Angeles Times\", approached the film in their assessments as an amusing, mildly erotic parody or spoof, not as a true science fiction offering or even a faintly serious space adventure. In his November 13 review, Stinson characterizes the feature as \"cheery frivolity\" with \"well-constructed cheesecake\", all of which is visually punctuated by \"luscious DeLuxe color\". He even compliments Gabor's performance: \nMarjory Adams, writing for \"The Boston Globe\", also recognized the Gabor vehicle as a \"merry spoof of science fiction\" that no one either on the screen or in theater audiences takes seriously, especially with regard to the actors' lines. \"The dialogue\", notes Adams, \"is of the sort which might be written by a high school freshman\", adding \"the only unexpected twist is [Zsa Zsa] isn't the queen.\" \"Variety\"—for decades a leading trade publication in covering the United States' entertainment industry—simply deemed \"Queen of Outer Space\" as \"a good-natured attempt to put some honest sex into science-fiction\".\n\nIn Canada in 1958, Mike Helleur, a reviewer for Toronto's \"The Globe and Mail\", compares the film's portrayal of life on Venus to \"living backstage at the Folies Bergère\", complete with light entertainment and rather scantily clad young women, who in this case take a \"slapstick romp\" through a Venusian queen's palace. One of several oddities that Helleur notices in the film is Gabor's singular identity among all the planet's inhabitants met by the Earthlings: \"She is...the only girl in Outer Space with a Hungarian accent.\"\n\nAs of 2019, Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 18% based on reviews from 11 critics.\n\nThe trade publication \"Motion Picture Daily\" reported in 1958 that the National Legion of Decency objected to the content of \"Queen of Outer Space\". In its October 3rd issue, less than a month after the film's release, the magazine provides a few examples of the Legion's classification system for judging a Hollywood production's level of \"decency\":\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2297434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297434", "title": "Polylactic acid", "text": "Polylactic acid\n\nPolylactic acid, or polylactide (PLA) is a thermoplastic polyester with backbone formula or , formally obtained by condensation of lactic acid with loss of water (hence its name). It can also be prepared by ring-opening polymerization of lactide , the cyclic dimer of the basic repeating unit. \n\nPLA has become a popular material due to it being economically produced from renewable resources. In 2010, PLA had the second highest consumption volume of any bioplastic of the world, although it is still not a commodity polymer. Its widespread application has been hindered by numerous physical and processing shortcomings. PLA is the most widely used plastic filament material in 3D printing.\n\nThe name \"polylactic acid\" does not comply with IUPAC standard nomenclature, and is potentially ambiguous or confusing, because PLA is not a polyacid (polyelectrolyte), but rather a polyester.\n\nThe monomer is typically made from fermented plant starch such as from corn, cassava, sugarcane or sugar beet pulp.\n\nSeveral industrial routes afford usable (i.e. high molecular weight) PLA. Two main monomers are used: lactic acid, and the cyclic di-ester, lactide. The most common route to PLA is the ring-opening polymerization of lactide with various metal catalysts (typically tin octoate) in solution or as a suspension. The metal-catalyzed reaction tends to cause racemization of the PLA, reducing its stereoregularity compared to the starting material (usually corn starch).\n\nAnother route to PLA is the direct condensation of lactic acid monomers. This process needs to be carried out at less than 200 °C; above that temperature, the entropically favored lactide monomer is generated. This reaction generates one equivalent of water for every condensation (esterification) step. The condensation reaction is reversible and subject to equilibrium, so removal of water is required to generate high molecular weight species. Water removal by application of a vacuum or by azeotropic distillation is required to drive the reaction toward polycondensation. Molecular weights of 130 kDa can be obtained this way. Even higher molecular weights can be attained by carefully crystallizing the crude polymer from the melt. Carboxylic acid and alcohol end groups are thus concentrated in the amorphous region of the solid polymer, and so they can react. Molecular weights of 128–152 kDa are obtainable thus.\n\nPolymerization of a racemic mixture of L- and D-lactides usually leads to the synthesis of poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA), which is amorphous. Use of stereospecific catalysts can lead to heterotactic PLA which has been found to show crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity, and hence many important properties, is largely controlled by the ratio of D to L enantiomers used, and to a lesser extent on the type of catalyst used. Apart from lactic acid and lactide, lactic acid \"O\"-carboxyanhydride (\"lac-OCA\"), a five-membered cyclic compound has been used academically as well. This compound is more reactive than lactide, because its polymerization is driven by the loss of one equivalent of carbon dioxide per equivalent of lactic acid. Water is not a co-product.\n\nThe direct biosynthesis of PLA similar to the poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s has been reported as well.\n\nAnother method devised is by contacting lactic acid with a zeolite. This condensation reaction is a one-step process, and runs about 100 °C lower in temperature.\n\nDue to the chiral nature of lactic acid, several distinct forms of polylactide exist: poly--lactide (PLLA) is the product resulting from polymerization of ,-lactide (also known as -lactide). PLA is soluble in solvents, hot benzene, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane.\n\nPLA polymers range from amorphous glassy polymer to semi-crystalline and highly crystalline polymer with a glass transition 60–65 °C, a melting temperature 130-180 °C, and a tensile modulus 2.7–16 GPa. Heat-resistant PLA can withstand temperatures of 110 °C. The basic mechanical properties of PLA are between those of polystyrene and PET. The melting temperature of PLLA can be increased by 40–50 °C and its heat deflection temperature can be increased from approximately 60 °C to up to 190 °C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA (poly--lactide). PDLA and PLLA form a highly regular stereocomplex with increased crystallinity. The temperature stability is maximised when a 1:1 blend is used, but even at lower concentrations of 3–10% of PDLA, there is still a substantial improvement. In the latter case, PDLA acts as a nucleating agent, thereby increasing the crystallization rate. Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA. The flexural modulus of PLA is higher than polystyrene and PLA has good heat sealability.\n\nSeveral technologies such as annealing, adding nucleating agents, forming composites with fibers or nano-particles, chain extending and introducing crosslink structures have been used to enhance the mechanical properties of PLA polymers. Polylactic acid can be processed like most thermoplastics into fiber (for example, using conventional melt spinning processes) and film. PLA has similar mechanical properties to PETE polymer, but has a significantly lower maximum continuous use temperature. With high surface energy, PLA has easy printability which makes it widely used in 3-D printing. The tensile strength for 3-D printed PLA was previously determined.\n\nThere is also poly(-lactide-\"co\"-,-lactide) (PLDLLA) – used as PLDLLA/TCP scaffolds for bone engineering.\n\nPLA can be solvent welded using dichloromethane.\n\nPLA is soluble in a range of organic solvents. Ethylacetate, due to its ease of access and low risk of use, is of most interest. If the filament is soaked in a small amount of ethylacetate, it will dissolve and can be used to clean 3D printing extruder heads or remove PLA supports. The boiling point of ethylacetate is low enough to also smooth PLA in a vapor chamber, similar to ABS and acetone.\nOther safe solvents to use include propylene carbonate, which is safer than ethylacetate but is difficult to purchase commercially. Pyridine can also be used however this is less safe than ethylacetate and propylene carbonate. It also has a distinct bad fish odor.\n\nPLA is used as a feedstock material in desktop fused filament fabrication 3D printers (e.g. RepRap). PLA-printed solids can be encased in plaster-like moulding materials, then burned out in a furnace, so that the resulting void can be filled with molten metal. This is known as \"lost PLA casting\", a type of investment casting.\n\nPLA can degrade into innocuous lactic acid, so it is used as medical implants in the form of anchors, screws, plates, pins, rods, and as a mesh. Depending on the exact type used, it breaks down inside the body within 6 months to 2 years. This gradual degradation is desirable for a support structure, because it gradually transfers the load to the body (e.g. the bone) as that area heals. The strength characteristics of PLA and PLLA implants are well documented.\n\nPLA can also be used as a decomposable packaging material, either cast, injection-molded, or spun. Cups and bags have been made from this material. In the form of a film, it shrinks upon heating, allowing it to be used in shrink tunnels. It is useful for producing loose-fill packaging, compost bags, food packaging, and disposable tableware. In the form of fibers and nonwoven fabrics, PLA also has many potential uses, for example as upholstery, disposable garments, awnings, feminine hygiene products, and diapers. Thanks to its bio-compatibility and biodegradability, PLA has also found ample interest as a polymeric scaffold for drug delivery purposes.\n\nRacemic and regular PLLA has a low glass transition temperature, which is undesirable. A stereocomplex of PDLA and PLLA has a higher glass transition temperatures, lending it more mechanical strength. It has a wide range of applications, such as woven shirts (ironability), microwavable trays, hot-fill applications and even engineering plastics (in this case, the stereocomplex is blended with a rubber-like polymer such as ABS). Such blends also have good form stability and visual transparency, making them useful for low-end packaging applications. Pure poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), on the other hand, is the main ingredient in Sculptra, a long-lasting facial volume enhancer, primarily used for treating lipoatrophy of cheeks. Progress in biotechnology has resulted in the development of commercial production of the D enantiomer form, something that was not possible until recently.\n\nPLA is degraded abiotically by three mechanisms:\n\n\nThe hydrolytic reaction is:\n\n<chem>-COO + H2O -> - COOH + -OH-</chem>\n\nThe degradation rate is very slow in ambient temperatures. A 2017 study found that at 25 °C in seawater, PLA showed no degradation over a year.\n\nPure PLA foams are selectively hydrolysed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (a solution mimicking body fluid). After 30 days of submersion in DMEM+FBS, a PLLA scaffold lost about 20% of its weight.\n\nPLA samples of various molecular weights were degraded into methyl lactate (a green solvent) by using a metal complex catalyst.\n\nPLA also be degraded by some bacteria, such as \"Amycolatopsis\" and \"Saccharothrix\". A purified protease from \"Amycolatopsis\" sp., PLA depolymerase, can also degrade PLA. Enzymes such as pronase and most effectively proteinase K from \"Tritirachium album\" degrade PLA.\n\nFour possible end of life scenarios are the most common:\n\n\n\n"}

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he was murdered in his home in 2001 by electrician Daniel Pelosi, who was convicted in 2004. Ted and his wife, Generosa Ammon, were in the midst of a divorce at the time of his death, and Daniel Pelosi was later romantically linked to Ammon's soon-to-be ex-wife. Ammon and his wife had originally married on February 2, 1986, and had two children, the twins Greg Ammon and Alexa Ammon, whom they adopted from the village of Medvedivtsi in the Mukachevo Region of Ukraine, in October 1992.\n\nAt the time of the murder, the couple were near finalization of their divorce. The custody agreement had been signed on October 18, 2001, and the divorce settlement was expected to be consented to the following week. Four months after Ted's death, Generosa married Daniel Pelosi on January 15, 2002; she died of cancer on August 22, 2003.\n\nAfter the Ammons moved back to the United States, he secured a position with Lord, Day and Lord. He subsequently went to work at the law firm of Mayer, Brown and Platt. One of this firm's clients was the then small investment firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. (KKR). In 1983, following his legal work on a KKR deal (and his divorce from his first wife), Ammon was recruited by the private equity firm, which specialized in leveraged buyouts. Ammon served as an Associate at Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. from 1984 to 1989 and as a General Partner from 1990 to 1992. He worked on many deals, notably the famous $31 billion RJ Reynolds/Nabisco takeover. He joined his colleagues in becoming a multimillionaire and was quoted numerous times in the book \"\". According to Russ Baker in the May 2002 issue of \"Gotham\", \"He was along for the wild ride as KKR grew into one of Wall Street's most aggressive and storied leveraged buyout outfits.\"\n\nIn 1992, Ammon left KKR in order to establish his own company, Big Flower Press. The firm became a leader in the printing of advertising inserts for newspapers. Ammon's goal was to create relationships with newspapers nationwide and then to provide them with other needed commodities. Big Flower was later renamed Vertis Holdings, Inc. Through more than thirty acquisitions, the firm diversified geographically and became a leading international supplier of integrated marketing services, including high-value printing, advertising, and imaging technology.\n\nVertis went public in 1995; in 1999, it was acquired by a group of investors, including Ammon, in a private leveraged recapitalization. Ammon served as Chief Executive Officer from the company's inception until April 1997 and as Chairman of the Board from the company's formation through December 2000. With Vertis facing dramatically changing market conditions (e.g., a high debt multiple and a slowing pace of acquisitions), a mutually advantageous separation/payout agreement was worked out between Vertis and Ammon. During his time at Vertis, Ammon had put together a \"deal team\" and venture capital program, managing an in-house venture business. He also had set up several holding companies, which held the vast share of his ownership interests.\n\nThese ventures directly invested in both public and non-public companies and in such general areas as technology, media, marketing and management services, and the internet. The specific fields of these companies included print and digital technology, diagnostic radiology, long-distance telephone service, and biopharmaceutical innovation.\n\nAfter leaving Vertis, Ted oversaw his team's venture capital investments through the entities that he had established. Much of the money that Vertis had paid to Ammon provided seed money for his investments. Two of the most profitable investments were in Moore Corporation Limited, a Vertis competitor, and in National Imaging Associates, Inc., a provider of health care services.\n\nTed's marriage turned hostile after Generosa found a receipt for a divorce lawyer in his desk. They were days from finalizing their divorce when on October 22, 2001, he was found bludgeoned to death in his East Hampton, NY weekend home. Because their divorce was not finalized and Ted's will had not been changed, Generosa inherited 50% of his estate, in accordance with the will, with the balance going to the Ammon Foundation. On January 15, 2002, Generosa married Daniel Pelosi, then sold the properties she had owned jointly with Ted.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. was appointed along with Generosa as co-executors of the estate. Ultimately, Generosa's estate inherited Ted's estate. The estate did not pass until after her death.\n\nPelosi was convicted of Mr. Ammon's murder in December 2004 and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nWith a total net worth of some $100 million, Ammon created the largest scholarship fund at Bucknell. Subsequently, he complemented this endowed program with a challenge/matching grant, resulting in added incentives for others to contribute to his alma mater. He served on the boards of the Municipal Art Society, and the YMCA. He attained to the title of Chairman at Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he worked closely with Wynton Marsalis.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, Greg and Alexa Ammon donated a $1 million gift from the Ammon Foundation to Jazz at Lincoln Center to name the R. Theodore Ammon Archives and Music Library. \"Ted considered the archive and music library essential to the integrity of this institution. The Ammon Archives and Music Library will be accessible to students and lovers of jazz the world over,\" said Wynton Marsalis, Managing and Artistic Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. \"My father's deep commitment to Jazz at Lincoln Center inspired my sister Alexa and I to continue his legacy with this naming gift for the preservation and perpetuation of the music he loved so much. Wynton's vision for The Ammon Archive and Music Library aligns with my father's commitment to enrich people's lives around the world with jazz,\" said Greg Ammon.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Jazz at Lincoln Center hosted a private ribbon cutting for The Ammon Archives and Music Library followed by the New York City film premiere of Greg Ammon's documentary, \"59 Middle Lane\" later that evening. Proceeds from the premiere event benefited Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute.\n\nThousands of people attended a Manhattan memorial service for Ammon in Alice Tully Hall, the home of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Among the Wall Street dignitaries in attendance were Henry Kravis, head of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co, Apollo Capital chief Leon Black, and Roger Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary under U.S. President Bill Clinton. Ammon's two children sat with the family but without their mother since, at the request of Ammon's sister Sandra, Generosa did not attend.\n\nAt the service, Wynton Marsalis honored Ammon with a New-Orleans-style jazz send-off. Before playing the funeral march, Marsalis spoke to the congregation. \"We want to know the particulars of death — it repulses us, it calls us, it fascinates us ... but only the dead know the facts of death, and they never tell.\"\n\nGenerosa died of breast cancer in August 2003. She left the majority of her estate to the twins, and legal guardianship of them to their nanny, Kaye Mayne. Full custody of the twins was eventually awarded to Ammon's sister; they spent the remainder of their childhood with her in Huntsville, Alabama. \n\nDavid Sutcliffe played Ammon in the TV movie \"Murder in the Hamptons\" (also known as \"Million Dollar Murder\").\n\nHis maternal grandmother was Neva Morris of Ames, Iowa, (August 3, 1895 - April 6, 2010), who at age 114 was the oldest person in the United States when she died.\n\n"}

He earned a Diploma of Teaching at the Auckland Teachers College in 1956. After gaining his teaching qualification he worked as a teacher at District High School, Reporoa, New Zealand, in 1960 and 1961. In 1962, he gained a Licentiate of Theology (LTh) from Whitley College, Melbourne, and, in 1965, a Diploma of Ministry from the Baptist Theological College, Auckland. He was a minister at the Manurewa Baptist Church in New Zealand from 1962 to 1968. He awarded himself a Master of Arts degree (Pacific College Theological) in 1987.\n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, Carter he was influential in the charismatic movement's growth in mainstream churches in Australia and New Zealand, regularly organising \"Holy Spirit Teaching Seminars\" in Sydney. His teaching was centred on themes of Christ's authority, \"victorious living\" and charismatic gifts. The majority of his teachings were distributed through Logos Foundation's \"Restore\" magazine and short books. Carter was a charismatic leader who became involved with a number of fundamentalist authoritarian Protestant religious groups and churches in Australia and the South Pacific.\n\nCarter moved his family from New Zealand to Australia in 1969. In the mid-1970s he was instrumental in introducing to Oceania the Shepherding Movement and associated discipleship from the \"Fort Lauderdale Five\" of Christian Growth Ministries (CGM) in the U.S.A. The movement promoted a pyramid-like authoritarian hierarchy, in which each \"disciple\" was accountable to a personal pastor (usually the leader of the \"Household\" - the name used for cell groups) for whole-of-life direction and personal decisions, and written covenants were encouraged. All these aspects theologically distanced the Logos movement from the majority of mainstream Protestant Christians.\n\nDoctrines of submission to God's delegated authorities in order to provide \"covering\" and complete spiritual protection were regularly promoted and were narrowly applied to wives obeying husbands, children obeying parents and disciples obeying leaders. The concept gained momentum over time and was eventually exercised in an almost cult-like manner. Leaders in the movement were required to be addressed by titles \"Brother\" and \"Sister\", which had a side effect of distancing them socially even further from the ordinary members in the movement. \"Brother Howard\" announced that he was in \"a submitted relationship\" to the CGM apostolic group of Bob Mumford, Ern Baxter, Charles Simpson, Derek Prince and Don Basham. While the teachings appeared to be biblical and promoted disciplined living, the result for non-leaders was a disempowering of their abilities and a neglect of their individual gifts and insights.\n\nIn 1980, the Logos-related churches became the Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities and in the mid-1980s were renamed the Covenant Evangelical Church. In the early 1980s, Carter led the Logos movement through a shift in eschatology from pre-millenarianism (described as a theology of defeat) to post-millenarianism (described as a theology of victory) of the specific stream of Dominionist, Reconstructionist Theology. Carter's interpretations and teaching became more extreme, and his style more cultish and authoritarian, causing some of his leadership team, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre, Sydney, to leave the movement.\n\nA key member at that time, Colin Shaw, believed that Carter was an \"anointed man of God\" and Shaw later became the Carter's \"right-hand\" man in his \"outreach and missionary works\" in Quezon City, Philippines. Logos used the Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church), as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Shaw coordinated and sponsored conferences featuring Carter as the lead speaker, under the Christian Renewal Centre's name. However, soon after the revelation of Carter's lifestyle, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and dispersed back into established local churches.\n\nDuring that period, Carter lived an extravagant lifestyle which frequently involved first-class air travel to North American and other international locations, staying at five-star hotels, and indulging in many other luxuries that were beyond the means of his loyal supporters. He drove a Mercedes Benz and lived in a large mansion with magnificent views from the Toowoomba escarpment. The Logos Foundation even owned and operated a motel in Canada with Australian staff. The financial affairs of Logos Foundation were shrouded in secrecy from most followers with little or no accountability regarding the vast sums of money that had been accumulated.\n\nIn the 1989 Queensland State election, Carter advanced the position that adherence to fundamentalist Christian doctrine was a more important consideration than opposition to the widespread corruption in the conservative Queensland government that had been exposed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Carter's campaign was vehemently anti-homosexual and, at times, the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law. An article in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" noted: \"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern\". The same article quoted from a letter Carter had written to supporters at the time: \"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also\". An earlier article published in the \"Herald\" quoted a Logos spokesman, in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of them, who stated \"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\".\n\nAt the peak of his power towards the end of that period, Carter used alleged \"personal revelations from God\" to exert enormous influence over the lives of his followers and the direction of the organization. His \"revelations\" were put on a par with scripture by his followers, and at times were effectively treated as being over and above scripture. That marked an effective shift from fundamentalist religion to the overt traits of a cult.\n\nBy the late 1980s, what remained of the Shepherding Movement worldwide had descended into manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements. Carter played these factors skilfully to entrench his own position and ensure the continuation of Logos Foundation.

Carter's alleged submission and accountability to the Fort Lauderdale Five, who were purported to provide a fail-safe discipleship that would in part protect him from personal failures, was a farce.

{"id": "2297500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297500", "title": "Nocturnes (Debussy)", "text": "Nocturnes (Debussy)\n\nNocturnes, L. 91, CD. 98, sometimes Trois Nocturnes or Three Nocturnes, is an impressionist orchestral composition in three movements by the French composer Claude Debussy, who wrote it between 1892 and 1899. It is based on poems from \"Poèmes anciens et romanesques\" (Henri de Régnier, 1890).\n\nBased on comments in various Debussy letters and in Leon Vallas's biography, it has generally been assumed that composition of the \"Nocturnes\" began in 1892 under the title \"Trois Scènes au Crépuscule\" (\"Three Scenes at Twilight\"), an orchestral triptych. However, the lack of actual manuscripts makes it impossible to determine whether such works were truly related to the \"Nocturnes\".\n\n\"Trois Scènes au Crépuscule\" was inspired by ten poems by Henri de Régnier entitled \"Poèmes anciens et romanesques\" (published in 1890).\nRégnier was a symbolist poet, and his poems contain vivid imagery and dreamlike associations of ideas. In a letter to Jacques Durand on 3 September 1907, Debussy writes \"I am more and more convinced that music, by its very nature, is something that cannot be cast into a traditional and fixed form. It is made up of colors and rhythms\"; he found suitable material in the imagery of these poems.\n\nDebussy may have begun creating the work for an intended performance in New York City, promoted and sponsored by Prince André Poniatowski, a banker and writer, and a confidant to whom Debussy frequently expressed himself in long letters. The New York performance was to consist of the premiere of Debussy's \"Fantaisie\" for piano and orchestra completed two years earlier, a rather traditional work in classical form but a tradition which Debussy in the next two years would reject and musically move away from (resulting in the \"Fantaisie\" never being performed or published in his lifetime); his experimental oratorio \"La Damoiselle élue\", from four years prior, also still unperformed as yet; and the \"Twilight Scenes\", which Debussy told the prince were \"pretty much finished\" even though he hadn't put anything on paper yet. The American concert deal fell through.\n\nDebussy was already working with difficulty on his opera \"Rodrigue et Chimène\", a biography of \"El Cid\"; it has been said that he eventually destroyed its complete score because he felt he could no longer write \"that kind of music\" to \"that kind of literature\", but his biographer says he merely concealed them and they remained in private collections.\n\nHe was also working on another orchestral triptych after a cycle of three poems by another symbolist poet, Stéphane Mallarmé, called \"L'après-midi d'un faune\", that was more in keeping with the new style of music and inspiration Debussy was seeking. He had in fact asked Henri de Régnier, a close associate of Mallarmé, to inform the latter of his interest in setting the poems to a new kind of musical impression. Mallarmé was vehemently opposed to juxtaposing poetry and music and was strongly against Debussy's compositional idea. After he heard the completed \"Prélude\" based on his first poem, however, Debussy had evidently caused him to completely reverse his belief, as he expressed his astonishment in lavishing praise and admiration in a personal letter to the composer.\n\nMeanwhile, Debussy's \"Scènes au Crépuscule\", after Régnier's poetry, were completed in piano score in 1893, but before Debussy had a chance to orchestrate them he attended the premiere performance of his String Quartet in G minor in December, given by the Ysaÿe Quartet led by Belgian violin virtuoso Eugène Ysaÿe. Debussy was impressed and flattered by Ysaÿe's interest in his music and decided to rewrite his \"Twilight Scenes\" into a piece for solo violin and orchestra.\n\nIn 1894, after completing the first movement of his Mallarmé triptych entitled \"Prélude\" (to \"The Afternoon of a Faun\"), he began the recomposition of the \"Twilight Scenes\" in a new inspired style, retitling the new version \"Nocturnes\" after a series of paintings of the same name by James McNeill Whistler, who was living in Paris at the time.\n\nIn September he described the music to Ysaÿe as \"an experiment in the different combinations that can be achieved with one colour—what a study in grey would be in painting\". Whistler's most famous painting was a portrait of his mother called \"Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1\". Debussy scored the orchestral part of the first of the three pieces for strings alone; the second for three flutes, four horns, three trumpets, and two harps; and the third for the two groupings together.\nThe first version of the \"Nocturnes\" seems to be the one described; he later abandoned the idea of the solo violin arrangement when he was unable to get Ysaÿe to undertake the performance.\n\nFollowing the abandonment of \"Rodrigue et Chimène\" in 1893, Debussy had immediately begun work on an opera more to his liking, \"Pelléas et Mélisande\", which occupied him with no small measure of trouble over the next nine years, until it premiered on 30 April 1902.\nThus it wasn't until 1896 that he informed Ysaÿe that the music for the \"Nocturnes\" had pretty much been completed and he still wanted Ysaÿe to perform the solo violin part.\n\nBy 1897, Debussy had decided to dispense with a solo violin part and the orchestral groupings, and simply write all three movements for a full orchestra. He worked for the next two years on the \"Nocturnes\", and once confessed to his friend and benefactor, the publisher Georges Hartmann, that he was finding it more difficult to compose these three orchestral nocturnes than a five-act opera. Wanting to equal the sensation caused by the success of \"The Afternoon of a Faun\" piece, he drove himself toward an over-perfectionism with the \"Nocturnes\". Having worked on the composition for as long as seven years, constantly revising it and changing its very structure several times, he expected it to live up to his own grand, avant-garde views:\nA full score of the manuscript of the \"Nocturnes\" was signed with the completion date of 15 December 1899. The manuscript bears a dedication to Georges Hartmann, who helped to support Debussy financially beginning in 1894. It was published under contract to Hartmann's publisher, under the Eugène Fromont imprint in 1900. This printed score contained dozens of errors.\n\nThe first two movements, \"Nuages\" and \"Fêtes\", received their premiere on 9 December 1900 in Paris by the Lamoureux Orchestra conducted by Camille Chevillard. The third movement \"Sirènes\" could not be staged because the female choir needed for it was unavailable.\n\nThe complete work was premiered by the same orchestra and conductor on 27 October 1901. Though these initial performances received a cool response from the public, they were more positively hailed by fellow musicians. A review by Pierre de Bréville in the \"Mercure de France\" has been translated as saying: \"It is pure music, conceived beyond the limits of reality, in the world of dreams, among the ever-moving architecture that God builds with mists, the marvelous creations of the impalpable realms.\"\n\nFor several years after their publication, almost until the day he died, Debussy continued to tinker with the composition, at first making corrections to dozens of errors in his copy of the published score, then moving on to adjusting small passages and fundamentally revising the orchestration. Debussy made many subtle changes to \"Sirènes\" to integrate the wordless singing of the women's chorus with the orchestra.\n\nTwo of these scores exist with Debussy's changes in different colors of pencils and inks, and often these changes are contradictory or simply alternate versions. As Debussy told conductor Ernest Ansermet when the latter asked which were the right ones: \"I'm not really sure; they are all possibilities. Take this score with you and use whatever you like from it.\"\n\nDebussy continued to modify the composition just as he had for the seven years prior to its publication, sometimes just not satisfied or sometimes thinking of a new experiment in sound, a new color combination of instrumental timbres he hadn't heard yet.\nMany of these changes were finally incorporated into a \"definitive version\" published in 1930 by Jobert. This version continues to be performed today.\n\nA comprehensive version addressing many more of Debussy's \"possibilities\" was published in 1999 by Durand, edited and annotated by Denis Herlin. One reviewer states \"in this new critical edition for the Debussy \"œuvres complètes\", all of the most important questions concerning the establishment of a text of the \"Nocturnes\" for practical performance have been confidently answered.\" Herlin has carefully traced and analyzed four printings of the \"Nocturnes\" by Fromont, ending in 1922; multiple scores by Jean Jobert between 1922 and 1930; multiple versions of a heavily revised Jobert score appearing between 1930 and 1964; a 1977 edition by Peters of Leipzig; and a study score from Durand.\n\nThe \"Nocturnes\" were performed as a ballet in May 1913, with Loie Fuller dancing.\nThe \"Nocturnes\" are considered one of Debussy's most accessible and popular works, admired for their beauty and for holding new possibilities and wonder upon repeated hearings.\n\nThere are three movements, each with a descriptive title. The entire work lasts approximately 25 minutes. Debussy wrote an \"introductory note\" to the \"Nocturnes\" and each of the individual movements, printed in the programme for the first complete performance in 1901:\n\n2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais (English horn), 2 (soprano) clarinets in B, 3 bassoons;\n\n4 valve (French) horns in F;\n\n2 timpani in B & D, harp;\n\n(strings): 1st & 2nd violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses.\n\nModéré – Un peu animé – Tempo I – Plus lent – Encore plus lent.\n\nBiographer Léon Vallas recorded Debussy's comments on the genesis of this piece:\n\n3 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais (English horn), 2 (soprano) clarinets in B, 3 bassoons;\n\n4 valve (French) horns in F, 3 valve trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba;\n\n2 harps, 3 timpani in D, A, & E, cymbals, snare drum;\n\n(strings): 1st & 2nd violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses.\n\nAnimé et très rythmé – Un peu plus animé – Modéré mais toujours très rythmé – Tempo I – De plus en plus sonore et en serrant le mouvement – Même Mouvement.\n\nLéon Vallas, in his biography, continues:\n\n3 flutes, oboe, cor anglais (English horn), clarinets in A, 3 bassoons;\n\n4 valve (French) horns in F, 3 trumpets in F;\n\n2 harps;\n\n(female chorus): 8 sopranos, 8 mezzo-sopranos;\n\n(strings): 1st & 2nd violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses.\n\nModérément animé – Un peu plus lent – En animant surtout dans l'expression – Revenir progressivement au Tempo I – En augmentant peu à peu – Tempo I – Plus lent et en retenant jusqu'à la fin.\n\nDebussy's biographer, Léon Vallas, said that Debussy's description of the \"Sirens\" movement reminded him of James Abbott McNeill Whistler's \"Harmonies in blue and silver\", saying \"The painter was a favourite with Debussy, and their art has often been compared.\"\nThe two were mutual influences, with Whistler\nborrowing from musical vocabulary to name his pictures, while Debussy chose painters' terms to entitle his symphonies.\nThe complete work was transcribed in 1910 for two pianos by Maurice Ravel and Raoul Bardac (Debussy's pupil and stepson), and was first performed in 1911. \"Fêtes\" was arranged for solo piano by the English pianist Leonard Borwick, and the arrangement has been recorded by Emil Gilels, among others. \"Fêtes\" has also been transcribed for large symphonic wind ensemble by Merlin Patterson and William Schaefer.\n"}

It applies the basic principle of heat transfer which occurs during evaporation of water. It was named after the place where it was invented – the small mining town of Coolgardie, Western Australia, near Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\n\nCoolgardie was the site of a gold rush in the early 1890s, before the Kalgoorlie-Boulder gold rush. \n\nFor the prospectors who had rushed here to find their fortune, one challenge was to extend the life of their perishable foods – hence the invention of the Coolgardie safe.\n\nThe safe was invented in the late 1890s by Arthur Patrick McCormick, who used the same principle as explorers and travelers in the Outback used to cool their canvas water bags: when the canvas bag is wet the fibers expand and it holds water. Some water seeps out and evaporates. It is most effective when air continually moves past it, such as when in a moving vehicle or when exposed to a breeze.\n\nThis technology is commonly thought to have been adopted by explorer and scientist Thomas Mitchell, who had observed the way some Indigenous Australians used kangaroo skins to carry water.\n\nThe Coolgardie safe was made of wire mesh, hessian, a wooden frame and had a hot dip galvanised iron tray on top. The galvanised iron tray was filled with water. The hessian bag was hung over the side with one of the ends in the tray to soak up the water. \n\nGradually the hessian bag, acting as a wick, would draw water from the tray by the process of capillary action. When a breeze came it would pass through the wet bag and evaporate the water. This would cool the air inside the safe, and in turn cool the food stored in the safe. This cooling is due to the water in the hessian needing energy to change state and evaporate. This energy is taken from the interior of the safe (metal mesh), thus making the interior cooler. There is a metal tray below the safe to catch excess water from the hessian.\n\nIt was usually placed on a veranda where there was a breeze. The Coolgardie safe was a common household item in Australia until the mid-twentieth century. Safes could be purchased ready-made or easily constructed at home. Some of the metal panel safes are highly decorated.\n\n"}

The novel describes the adventures of a half-Native American, half-English woman, who is shipwrecked on an island. The protagonist uses her knowledge of Christianity to convert the indigenous inhabitants on the island as part of her survival mode.\n\nThis work belongs to the literary genre of the Robinsonade, in that - like other works of its era - it emulates Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel \"Robinson Crusoe\". Although there are many similarities to Defoe's novel, the differences are what make \"The Female American\" distinctive. For instance, the narrator is not only a woman but is also biracial, as the daughter of a Native American princess and an English settler who resided in Virginia. The protagonist is also multilingual. Although Defoe's protagonist (Robinson Crusoe) chooses to leave his home and set out into an unexplored and dangerous life abroad, Winkfield's protagonist's (Unca Eliza Winkfield) trials and adventures are forced upon her. It is only in the latter part of the narrative that the female protagonist finds a living condition on the island that is more favorable than her American or European origins. In addition, the novel engages with the theme of finding one's home away from the native land, which can be identified in a range of fiction of 18th-century England. While Defoe's protagonist remains condescending towards the native people that he encounters and easily deserts his companions for personal salvation, Winkfield's protagonist is compassionate and benevolent towards the indigenous community, embracing its practices. Similarly, the native people that Unca Eliza discovers easily accept Christianity unlike Man Friday in Michael Tournier's modern revision of the Robinson Crusoe narrative, \"Friday\".\n\nHistorical references to colonial America and eighteenth-century England, the fantasy of a feminist utopia, and the woman's role in colonialism and religious conversion are just a few of the components of this narrative. One of the criticisms that accompanied its publication in 1767 was that female readers might possibly partake in similar adventures, thus questioning their lives and limitations. The fear was that the virtue of the women of this period would be potentially endangered. In order to assuage such concerns, the introduction emphasizes that the story is not only \"pleasing and instructive\" but \"fit to be perused by the youth of both sexes, as a rational, moral entertainment.\"\n\nThe poem opens with a declaration of the author's intention to relate the events of her life, which introduces the first major theme of female adventure outside of the domestic sphere. She describes her grandfather's plantation in Virginia, and the of settlers by the native Indians, which leaves her grandfather dead and her father, Mr. William Winkfield, captured. As her father is about to be put to death by the Indians, a young Indian princess, named Unca, saves his life and secures his liberty by taking a liking to him and putting him in favor with the king. Unfortunately, his troubles mount when the sister of the young princess grows equally fond of him, and solicits him for marriage. He responds unfavorably, claiming love only for Unca, so she poisons him and leaves him for dead. Unca comes upon him and saves his life yet again, and they remove themselves from the village to live with the settlers. They are not there long before their daughter, Unca Eliza, is born, and they are visited by two Indian men sent from Alluca, the jealous sister of princess Unca. The two men reveal daggers and a skirmish leaves Unca and one of the assassins dead, while Mr. Winkfield escapes death and takes the remaining assassin prisoner. Under the council of the other settlers, he decides to set him free, sending him back to the village with a promise of revenge on Alluca from Mr. Winkfield. She dies of grief before revenge can be had, and sends her heart and a request for forgiveness to Mr. Winkfield.\n\nOvercome with grief for his murdered wife, Mr. Winkfield decides to return to England with his daughter in order to take care of his sick brother. While there, Unca Eliza grows up in the company of her cousins, is educated and exposed to Christianity, under which she was baptized, and notes with what great attention the English attend to her due to the complexion of her skin and her mixed Indian and English dress. Shortly after arriving in England, the grief-stricken Mr. Winkfield desires to return to Virginia, but intends for Unca Eliza to remain in England to finish her education. When she is eighteen years old, she is summoned by her father to return, and she makes the journey alongside her cousin, John Winkfield, who solicits her for marriage. She denies him, claiming she will never marry a man who cannot use a bow and arrow any better than she. Soon after arriving back in Virginia, Unca Eliza's father dies, and she is left alone. She desires to return to England when she is twenty-four, so she purchases a sloop and assembles a crew for the journey. On the way, her chosen captain solicits her for marriage to his son, but she refuses in the same manner as before. He is outraged by this, and threatens to leave her on an uninhabited island - securing all her money to him - if she does not reconsider. An altercation ensues, and the captain is thrown overboard by two slaves. (He is later recovered.) He gives Unca Eliza another opportunity to reconsider, but she does not, and he leaves her on an uninhabited island.\n\nOnce on the island, Unca Eliza, realizing she is a castaway grieves, then quickly devotes herself to God realizing how lucky she is to be alive. Unca Eliza finds an abandoned hermitage shortly after, which she takes as her shelter. Inside, she finds a manuscript of the previous occupant telling her how to survive as they have. The manuscript implies the occupant may soon be dead. She begins settling into her new lifestyle. She learns how to fend for herself and begrudgingly eats some goats and roots. After several weeks of this, she realizes the gravity of her situation and is much distressed, and comes down with a debilitating fever. Once she recovers, she consults the manuscript for more information, and learns that there is life on the island after all. She decides to explore her new habitation and understands the hermitage to be a religious temple of the sun, which contains numerous mummies. Upon returning from her explorations, she is startled by the presence of the hermit, who she thought was no longer on the island. The hermit dies overnight, and Unca Eliza makes more explorations and discovers an underground passageway leading to an idol of worship. While she is there she discovers that she can climb inside \"the oracle\" and it allows her voice to be heard for a great distance. A tempest brews outside, trapping her in the passageway. Afterward, the temple is visited by a group of Indians, as the manuscript predicted, and Unca Eliza hides in the secret passageway. While she is in there, she resolves to convert the Indians to Christianity (\"from their idolatry\") and develops a plan to hide within the body of the idol and to speak to the Indians when they arrive for their worship on the following year. An earthquake ensues during her practicing of the plan, and upon its conclusion, she discovers it has destroyed her abode. When the Indians arrive for their worship, she converses with the high-priest from within the idol, instructing the Indians in Christian principles.\n\nBy the end of Volume I, Unca has instructed the Indians to come back to visit her the following week for further instructions. She takes this time to reconsider what she had said to the Indians and how she should continue on with them. She also explored the island and discovered an extraordinary four footed animal. It was the size of a large dog, with long legs, a slender body, it had uncommonly large eyes which projected far from its head, and two rows of sharp but short teeth. This creature excited Unca's curiosity so she followed it. Other animals who were larger than it, fled at the sight of it. It came to a grassy area and extended itself as if dead, with eyes shut and lips closed. She sat down at some distance to watch it. The hair on his body was thick and long, five or six inches (152 mm), and formed bunches of clusters. A great number of field mice came up to him and began nibbling at the clusters of hair. It continued to lie still until a considerable number of mice had employed themselves among it. He then got up and shook violently, but the mice were stuck on him. He turned around, extended his long neck and began eating the mice greedily. In a few minutes he ate near three hundred of them because his body was almost covered in mice. Unca's curiosity was satisfied.\n\nThe day had come when the Indians were instructed to return to the island for further instructions. Unca took her place in the statue and waited. Only seven priest returned so she asked them why they did not bring their people? The high priest responded that it was their business to instruct their people after she has taught them. The priest explained that if she taught everyone, then they no longer had any means of employment. Unca told them that she will not teach them only and that they should not fear. She instructed the priest to go back and return with their people. He agreed and told her that they will return with their people in the morning because it will take up too much time in one day to complete this task.\nThe next morning, the priest returned with a considerable number of people. She lectured for three hours and then told them to break for refreshments. She also instructed them to retire further from her so that she may emerge from the statue and take a refreshment for herself. She encouraged the people to ask her questions but they responded that \"our priest know all, teach our priest and they will teach us\". She concluded from this answer that the priest had instructed the people in private and then reminded everyone of what she had told them the previous day. Finishing her lecture, she told everyone that she had much more to teach them and that they should return once a week. The high priests being old should come if he pleased and all other could also choose to come if they wished. Unca excused the Indians and soon they all left the island.\n\nBeing suspicious of the priest because they would never suffer to be useless to their people, Unca decided that she must live among the Indians. Unca wished to make more progress with her teachings and it would be hard to do so from the statue once a week. It would also be inconvenient for them to come during the rainy season. She also considered her living arrangement. It would be hard for her to live underground during the summer and she would be confined to it also in the winter. After much thought she decided that it would be absolutely necessary to live with the Indians. She planned to introduce herself to the Indians but keep them ignorant of who she was and how she came to them so that she \"might preserve a superiority over them\". When the Indians returned to the island, she told them that they were ignorant of the true God and that God will send a holy woman to instruct them more fully. She told them to not be fearful or suspicious of that person who will be a woman. She will bring holy writings. They must respect her, do everything she commands, do not ask her where she comes from or when she is leaving, when she wishes to visit the island do not follow her or do anything that she forbids. Unca told them that she does not wish to force this woman upon them. They tell her to \"Let her come! We will love and obey her!\" She then instructed them to come back three days later, two hours after sunrise, and they will see the woman dressed like a high priest. After the Indians received her instructions and left, Unca began preparing for her departure.\n\nUnca rises early and begins preparing for the return of the Indians. She dresses herself in white and adorns herself in ornate jewelry of gold and precious stones. She leaves her shelter, locks it, and covers it up. Unca arrives at the statue and awaits the return of the Indians with her a staff, her bow and arrow, and a bundle of treasures. She also remembers to pray to God, that He might take away her fear and guide her on this grand task. The Indians arrive and the high-priest greets Unca respectfully. Unca announces her intentions: she will live with them for some time and instruct them on God's teachings, which she says will make them \"happy for ever.\" Unca does not fail to mention a set of rules which include the following: they must obey her orders, learn her teachings, and never ask where she came from, or when she is leaving. At this, the high-priest responds with bows of acceptance and gratitude but follows with a proposal that surprises Unca. Since their previous king had died recently and left no heirs, he asks Unca to take her place as their queen. She thanks him for the offer but declines saying she will be only their \"instructor.\" They all agree and Unca presents the high-priest and many of the people with rings from her treasures. A few of the Indians come forward and offer Unca some food and drink and Unca stands to say grace. This marks the beginning of her Christian teachings. She then mentions Jesus Christ and explains the Christian understanding that he is the son of God to whom they owe their thanks and praise.\n\nBefore embarking with the Indians, Unca prays to God. After the prayer, she sings a hymn in the Indian language to demonstrate the Christian ritual for the Indians. She leaves with the large group by canoe, and is welcomed in the Indian country where she is provided with lodging and 6 Indian servant girls. She is presented with gifts of liquor, dried meat, flowers, and fruit. Unca begins daily instruction for the priests on Scripture, and a weekly public instruction to spread the Christian faith. She reflects upon her surprise at the willingness and enthusiasm of the Indians to learn about Christianity. Unca also begins to translate her prayer books and the Bible from English into the Indian language. She admits that she is not happy living among the Indians, and that she knows she is perceived to be more than mortal and deliberately takes advantage of this. In her spare time, she shoots her bow and arrow, and revisits her old island. Two years pass living with the Indians, and Unca completes her translation of the Bible, the Catechism, and most of her Prayer Book. She is proud to have replaced the Indians religion of idolatry with Christianity.\n\nReturning on a regular trip to her island, Unca immediately perceives Europeans approaching the Idol. Concerned that they might try and enslave the Indians she ascends into the Oracle. Realizing that her cousin is among them she decides to speak to them through the Idol. Their discussion confirms that it is her cousin Winkfield and Unca assures him - via the Oracle's booming voice - that she is alive. She then asks them to sing a hymn her uncle wrote during which she sets up an Indian instrument to play through the Oracle's mouth and dresses herself in ceremonial robes. Unca sneaks up behind them and holds a sun staff in front of her face, slowly revealing herself, further terrifying the company in the process. While her cousin is relieved to see her alive, the rest of his company has been deeply disturbed by the loud speech of the Oracle, the music which Unca made it play, and her sudden appearance in luxurious robes. Unca tells her cousin that she will explain all these things in good time, but the company is so frightened by her that they are unable to speak.\n\nThe company returns to their ship and Cousin Winkfield explains that the day after Unca was left on the island Captain Shore captured the vessel that she was on. The same Captain brought her cousin here to look for her, but now he is concerned the rest of the party has frightened the crew so much that she might not be able to get on board. Unca needs to leave for a while to settle things in her adopted home, but her cousin does not want her to leave at all. She insists and while she is waiting with her cousin and Captain Shore the crew members send a representative party to meet them. The party states that they are so terrified by Unca that they declare her to be the bride of Satan. Unca's cousin then agrees that she should return to her village and they make plans to meet on her island in the morning to set sail, which should give him time to calm down the crew.\n\nAs Unca leaves the sailors let out a shout for joy and she returns to the Idol to think about what has happened. She cries over her own folly and worries that her cousin might be murdered until she is exhausted and seeks some refreshment. Walking to her provisions she is immediately met by her cousin who tells her that they will not let him on board the ship. He assures her that Captain Shore will attempt to calm down his crew and will return in the morning to take them both on board. Unca and her cousin sit down to eat and he relates the fantastical claim of the crew: that they had seen her fly, filling the air with the smell of brimstone. Captain Shore challenged their claims saying that they are mutineers, but the crew insists that they are not, they just refuse to have the She-Devil or her friends on board. Unca and Winkfield decide to return to the island in the morning to see what Captain Shore has accomplished with his crew.\n\nUnca meets up with her canoe and tells the Indians - who had never seen a white man - that he is a relation of hers, which satisfies them. As they return to her village Unca tells her story to her cousin, who wishes to join her on her Christian mission. She discourages him and he proposes to her, which she delays answering as they have arrived on shore. They dine with the priests and return to her island in the morning. They spend most of the day on the island and are about to give up hope of seeing the ship when they find a note that Captain Shore has left for them. In it he states that the crew is resolute in their foolishness and the best he can do is leave Winkfield's effects on the shore and return for him with a new crew. This will take a year at least, but he will tell his family that both he and his cousin are alive, and when he returns he will leave them a means to signal his ship. Winkfield is happy because he can renew his suit of Unca, who only loves him as a friend and relation. She does consider that marriage would give them the chance to be alone together, as being alone with a man she is not married to hurts her modesty.\n\nWinkfield's effects are taken to the village including some clothes for Unca for which she is very grateful. They also introduce chickens to the island along with a gun, telescope, and other goods, the result of which is to make the Indians as impressed with him as they are with Unca. Winkfield and Unca observe the sabbath and preach in English and the native dialect until Winkfield is fluent in the native language. Unca becomes so impressed with Winfkield that they are married within two months of his arrival and have both church and Indian ceremonies. The Indians are now baptized, married, and are \"admitted to the Lord's supper.\" At this point Unca asks her husband Winkfield how his arrival came about. Winkfield recounts how Captain Shore sought out audience with his father and related the story of her abandonment. Captain Shore tells them that he became a pirate out of need, but vowed not to kill anyone, and made his crew promise the same. They were about to simply rob Unca's ship when they saw her Indian servant hanging from the yard-arm and demanded that the captain explain himself. The Indian is taken down and he tells Shore the entire story of the captain's treachery and Unca's abandonment on the island.\n\nShore continues to recount his story saying that he found Unca's effects on board the ship, but is resolved to make the captain confess. Shore threatens to hang the captain at the yard-arm upon which the captain immediately admits to everything. Shore is about to hang the captain when he has a religious epiphany and repents, resolving to change his ways, repair his past, and bring the captain to proper justice in England. The captain is restrained and Unca's wounded servants are attended to; the male servant dies within a few days, but the two female servants survive. Shore then tells his crew that he hopes to lead them to repent just as he led them to sin and they all agree not to be pirates anymore. He hopes that Winkfield Sr. will help them procure a pardon so that they may turn in the captain and start their lives anew. He also pledges that whoever can prove that he robbed them will have their stolen effects returned. Shore then asks if Winkfield Sr. will accept this proposal, if he will not, then Captain Shore will leave them unharmed. They agree to the plan and give Shore passage to France so that he may await his pardon in safety.\n\nWinkfield continues to relate the story to Unca, stating that they received the conditional pardon for Shore and brought the captain and his crew to justice. While Shore was preparing to return to his crew he spent a great deal of time with cousin Winkfield who had hoped to find the island where Unca was abandoned in the hopes of bringing her home or properly mourning her. Winkfield is given permission by his family to search for Unca and Captain Shore is glad to take him to the island he suspects Unca to be upon. Winkfield has thus filled in Unca on all that had happened between her abandonment and her discovery. Their life continues on the island with Winkfield returning to Unca's island every two weeks until he finds a cannon with which to signal Captain Shore's ship. Captain Shore then spends three days in their village, further updating them on events in England. The treacherous captain was brought to trial and hanged along with three of his crew-mates. Captain Shore delivered the pardon to his crew and spent time returning stolen goods to their original owners. Unca and Winkfield then tell Shore what they have been doing and Shore asks to join their village, which they consent to. They then return to Unca's island to collect the gold to pay for their needed purchases and destroy the Idol to prevent the Indians from worshiping it ever again. Winkfield and Shore then return to England to get the family's blessing and to bring back books and other needed items. Shore and Winkfield return to the island and Unca sends back her manuscript whose final passage states that none of them have any intention of returning to Europe ever again.\n\nFemale authority is a major theme in \"The Female American\". This is evident from the outset of the novel, beginning with the great power and political influence of the young princess in the Indian tribe. Also, despite the fact that the book follows the Robinsonade genre conventions, it explores the possibility of a female adventurer rather than a typically male one. Unca Eliza is a powerful and independent heroine who commands respect outside of the normal domestic setting. For instance, she displays her dominance in her numerous denials for marriage. In response to her cousin's persistent proposals, she contends:\n\"I would never marry any man who could not use a bow and arrow as well as I could; but as he still continued his suit, I always laughed at him, and answered in the Indian language, of which he was entirely ignorant; and so by degrees wearied him into silence on that head\" (51).\nThis also exemplifies Unca Eliza's superior worldliness, and her ability to compete on an equal level with her male counterparts. What complicates this theme is that Unca Eliza, though solitary on the deserted island, is aided in survival by the experiences and manuscript of a male character. However, it is ultimately Unca Eliza's decision to trust in God, and the ingenuity of her endeavor to convert the Indians to Christianity, that provide her with a successful way off the island.\n\nHowever, even with this authority, Unca Eliza, does conform, at the end of the novel, to what is expected of her. She marries. Even when her cousin has not accomplished the task of mastering the bow and arrow. It seems this event is the author's attempt of satisfying the readers of the day. They would expect the woman to marry because isn't that what every 18th century woman strives for? For Unca Eliza the marriage serves more as a way to have companionship. She does not lose her independence and works beside her husband instead of under him. This may not be considered authority but equality.\n\nWhen Unca decides to convert the Indians to Christianity the use of performance is important to note because the reader can visually see how Unca uses the body of a male cleric to promote her ability as a female missionary, a role usually designated to men. Before Unca’s performance, she describes the sun idol saying that, “The image itself, of gold, greatly exceeded human size: it resembled a man clad in a long rob or vest” (Winkfield 86). Kristianne Vaccaro is surely right in reference to this part when she says “what is most significant about the text’s—and, ultimately, about Unca’s—performance of these religious “truths” is that she herself cannot access them without first playing the role of male cleric” (Vaccaro 136). Unca uses the body of the sun idol to instill religious truths because she herself would not be able to do so as a female. Once the performance begins, the reader can clearly see how Unca has used the body of the sun idol to perform her duty as a female missionary. She narrates that “\"High-Priest.\" Did God send you to teach us? \"Answer.\" He brought me hear, and I will teach you.” (Winkfield 104). Unca has successfully convinced the Indians of her religious truths and has used the sun idol to her aid in establishing her authority not only over the Indians but the reader as well. Unca no longer refers to herself as Unca but “\"Answer”\" signaling that the reader can now take all that she says for truth because she has successfully transformed into her role as a female missionary. This performance was necessary because Unca could not assert her authority without first performing a role she was not physically in reality; the role of a male cleric. Unca’s performance allows her to move through genders fluidly and assert her authority as a female missionary to both the Indians and the reader.\n\nWhile this performance does help Unca to establish authority in this instance, the loss of Unca's voice towards the end of her narrative complicates her position as both a female authority figure and missionary. \"The Female American\" is no longer in the voice of Unca but “we” as she succumbs to marrying her white European cousin, they narrate “ As we never intended to have any more to do with Europe, captain Shore and my husband ordered the ship, by whom, for my father and mother’s satisfaction, I sent over these adventures” (Winkfield 162). Unca has become a “we”, much different from her previous position as the “\"Answer”\" showing that once her cousin came back, societal gender roles were put back into play and it did not matter what Unca did to try and assert herself. She even changes her “history” into “adventures” because it is no longer a history about her life but her helping her husband, the missionary, in this new world. Unca may seem to be a trailblazer at the beginning of her narrative but only exposes herself to be a pawn used to “keep intact the social hierarchies from which [she] arises” (Vaccaro 150).\n\nUnca's faith in God and her desire to convert the Indians to Christianity prompt her to speak forth from the Idol as a type of \"Queen\" or female \"God.\" This raises the issue of capitalist accumulation, colonial conquest, and political imperialism which many theorists have associated with Defoe's novel, Robinson Crusoe. There are several situations and events in the novel which portray Unca's relation to this theory. After Unca first speaks to the Indians through the masking of the Idol, she is uncertain whether she had done an evil act. Although she does affirm that Idol Worship is contrary to Christian doctrine, but she bravely used this same idol to dispel a belief in false gods. Then speaking through this idol, she revealed her true intent, and through her diligence, she converts the natives to Christianity.\n\"I heartily repented that I had ever spoken to them... Thus I was distracted whether I determined to stay, or go; to stay was attended with certain evils; to go, too probably, with very great ones. Miserable wretch! cried I, what shall I do? tears succeeded; and I could think no more, with any coherence\" (110).\nWhile she is unsure of the morality of her decision to speak to them as a God, she still goes on to enforce her superiority over them:\n\"[B]y keeping them ignorant of who I was, or how I came to them, I might preserve a superiority over them, sufficient to keep them in awe, and to excite their obedience: yet I determined to speak no untruth\" (110).\nUnca's desire to \"preserve a superiority over them\" stems from an even deep-seated fear and an increased longing for protection and safety. To her, God is a powerful force, yet in a moment of despair, He is not her savior. Unca turns to a statue, a false idol, to give her protection from the unknown and in an attempt to preserve her life, she readily embraces this new found \"superiority\" and power over the Indians.\n\nShe does however, retain her dignity by remaining truthful throughout her conversations with the Indians. The fact that she had slaves who \"begged\" to go with her on her travels is yet another incident which can be seen as Capitalist Accumulation. And relating her strategies with those of Robinson Crusoe's, hers seem more manipulative than severe. She does have two weapons: a knife and a bow and arrow. However, she only uses them (the knife) when absolutely necessary.\n\nEarly in the novel there is another scene that discusses imperialism. In this scene, Unca's father is reflecting on a conversation he once had with his elder brother, who was a clergyman. His brother clearly disagrees with imperialism and tries to dissuade Unca's father from invading other countries:\n\n\"We have no right to invade the country of another, and I fear invaders will always meet a curse; but as your youth disenables you from viewing this expedition in that equitable light that it ought to be looked on, may your sufferings be portionably light! for our God is just, and will weigh our actions in a just scale\" (37).\n\nEven though Unca's father had this dramatic warning from his brother, he still goes on to try and conquer foreign countries. His brother even tries to infuse guilt into his speech, but it still does not register with Unca's father. Unca's father's attitude is clearly reflected in Unca when she uses the idol statue to convert the Indians.\n\nUnca Eliza Winkfield's grandfather is said to be Edward Wingfield, the first President of the Virginia colony. Winkfield was dismissed as president when the Colony of Virginia fell under a harsh food shortage, which in turn caused many internal political disputes about Winkfield's ability to successfully govern Virginia. His immediate predecessors were John Ratcliffe and then the famous John Smith. After being expunged from his presidential duties, Edward Winkfield wrote a famous text by the name of \"Discourse on Virginia.\" In this text he speaks of his true passions, his resentment of being asked to leave, future plans that he had for Virginia, outlooks on Virginian society in general and the faults of Virginia that could possibly lead to its Demise.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2297594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297594", "title": "Ashok Banker", "text": "Ashok Banker\n\nAshok Kumar Banker (born 7 February 1964 in Mumbai, India) is an author and screenwriter. His writing spans crime thrillers, essays, literary criticism, fiction and mythological retellings. The author of several well-received novels including a trilogy billed as \"India's first crime novels in English\", he became widely known for his retellings of Indian mythological epics, starting with the internationally acclaimed and best-selling eight-volume \"Ramayana\" Series, which has been credited with the resurgence of mythology in Indian publishing. \"The New York Times\" credited him with making mythology the most successful category in Indian publishing, describing his work as being \"better written than many books in the genre that have followed – introduced the Ramayana to a new generation of readers.\" His books have sold over 2 million copies and have been published in 16 languages in 58 countries. His Epic India Library is an attempt to retell all the myths, legends and itihasa of the Indian sub-continent in one massive story cycle comprising over 70 volumes, \"an epic library of India\". He is frequently nominated and shortlisted as one of India's top thinkers and celebrities. The upcoming two-film adaptation of his \"Mahabharata\" is expected to be the biggest Indian film production to date.\n\nIt was Banker's British grandmother, May Agnes Smith, who effectively raised and supported him. May Agnes Smith had been born and raised in Ceylon. When that country achieved independence, all other members of her family chose to claim British citizenship and either return to the UK or migrate to other countries. May Agnes was the only member of her family to move to India. She married Mr. D'Souza, an Indian Christian from Goa, which was in those days a Portuguese territory. The couple settled in the neighbourhood of Byculla in Mumbai, or Bombay as it was then known.\n\nIt was in the same house in Byculla that Banker grew up, under the care of his grandmother. He has mentioned in interviews how she not only encouraged him to write but even financed the publication of his first book, a collection of his poetry titled \"Ashes in the Dust of Time,\" which he self-published at age 15, and which was selected to represent Young India at the World Book Fair in Paris. He also found early support from his school Principal, Miss Sophy Kelly, a prominent patron of the arts and leader of the Bene Israel Jewish community in Mumbai at the time. Among his first literary efforts was an ambitious play based on the Book of Revelations of St. John from the Bible, produced by Kelly and performed by Banker and other students at their high school auditorium, Hill Grange. The school itself was the alma mater of many prominent personalities.\n\nSubsequently, Banker has said in numerous interviews that when the time came for him to choose which religion he wished to belong to, he chose simply \"to stay human\".\n\nBanker has often commented publicly about abuse he faced growing up on account of his lack of religion, caste or racial identity. Describing himself as a 'post-racial post-religious' Indian. His refusal to identify himself as belonging to a caste, religion or community caused many conflicts during his childhood, since it was at odds with India's traditional caste-based social structure. This culture of segregation and systematic bias turned him away from his estranged biological father's religion Hinduism, and Banker grew up with little or no exposure to Hindu culture, religion or literature. He identified himself with other minorities and his closest friends were Muslims, Parsis, Christians and Jews. He took Persian and Urdu lessons for a time and even won a college-level prize for Urdu-Translation in collaboration with a Pakistani friend. The son of an Iranian dissident fleeing the Shah regime stayed briefly with Banker's grandmother in Byculla, exposing Banker further to radical Islamic thought and culture and making him even more determined to stay iconoclastic in his religious outlook. Among his close friends were the son and daughter of the Rabbi of the Magen David Synagogue in Byculla, who also studied at the same high school.\n\nAshok Banker worked as a successful freelance journalist and columnist for several years, breaking front-page news for publications such as \"The Times of India\", Mumbai, and cover stories for \"Outlook magazine\", New Delhi. He was earlier also known as a prolific reviewer and commentator on contemporary Indian literature, and as a candid essayist with a particular focus on media hypocrisy in India, and the western racial bias against South Asian writers. He was a prolific literary critic and reviewer, known for his candour and bluntness in reviewing books by Indian authors. His views often veered from the outright derogatory to effusive praise.\n\nBanker is a contemporary Indian novelist often counted among the significant literary names in post-colonial Indian literature His work is the focus of several academic studies for its cross-cultural themes and realistic portrayals of Indian urban issues. He is one of few contemporary Indian authors writing in English to be included in prestigious anthologies such as \"The Vintage Book of Modern Indian Literature\" and \"The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature\". His work has been the subject of dissertations, course study material, and is frequently included in the syllabi or reading lists of management institutes and studies of modern Indian English Literature. He is credited as having introduced Indian mythology to a new generation of readers with works that have been described as \"better written than many books in the genre that followed\", \"well paced\" and \"breathes humanity into characters that most Indians consider deities. This brings freshness to the old stories and makes their intricate, discursive narratives more accessible to an audience that has been bred on the linear plots of Hollywood and Bollywood movies.\" His novel \"Vertigo\" is considered a \"remarkable\" fictional representation of the new Bombay; it is \"an autobiographical novel about a young man in advertising who lives with his disturbed Christian mother\". First published in 1992, \"Vertigo\" was highly praised by critics and readers alike at the time, including the late Dom Moraes. Although it has often appeared on readers' choice polls as a favourite contemporary fiction on post-liberalisation India, it is one of Banker's lesser known works.\n\nBanker has published in several genres, ranging from contemporary fiction about urban life in India to multi-volume mythological epics, as well as cross-genre works. Three of his early novels to be published were crime thrillers, claimed to be the first written by an Indian novelist in English. They gained him widespread attention and still continue to be regarded with critical approval. Most recently, literary critic Zac O'Yeah wrote: \"Slimmer and much more hard-boiled are three striking crime novels written by Ashok Banker many years ago. I still remember reading The Iron Bra, a blood-soaked story of a female investigator, Sheila Ray, whose finger rests lightly on the trigger as she defends her family’s reputation and takes on gangsters in a particularly unforgettable shootout. The growing city’s construction sites were a crucial component in the tight plot. Tragically, my own copy is long lost and second-hand copies cost $129 (approx. Rs6,000) plus shipping on an online bookshop, so it looks like it’s high time to have this gem of a crime novel reissued in an omnibus edition along with Banker’s Ten Dead Admen and Murder & Champagne (all three originally published in 1993).\" His Kali Rising is a contemporary radical feminist thriller series featuring only women protagonists. The first book, Blood Red Sari, was launched at the Tata Literature Live! literary festival in Mumbai in November 2012.\n\nThe stories of his \"\"Devi\"\" series are short works featuring Avatars of the Hindu goddess Devi, and have appeared in various science fiction, fantasy, and horror magazines. Several of these genre publications have claimed that his was the first speculative fiction by an Indian author writing in English to be published. Due to his early association with the scifi genres, his work is often found on several recommended reading lists and discussed in seminars, conventions, essays and books. His \"Gods of War\" was released by Penguin in 2009. But it was his recasting of Indian mythology in the mould of \"western-style fantasy\" that got him international attention and made him an important addition to the history of post-Independence literature.\n\nThree of his novels contain autobiographical elements and are closely related to one another. His first novel (though the fifth published) \"Vertigo\" is about a man struggling to make a successful career and home life in Bombay (the former name of Mumbai). \"Byculla Boy\" takes its name from the Byculla suburb of Bombay where he and his mother grew up. \"Beautiful Ugly\" and the complementary documentary of the same title are a tribute to his mother, portraying the tragic events of her life.\n\nBanker is best known for his Ramayana Series, a freely imaginative retelling of the ancient Sanskrit epic poem. The series is ranked at No.1 on the \"Internet Book List\". The eight-book Series was published in 56 countries and 7 languages to considerable critical acclaim. In India, the Series continues to enjoy popularity and sales. It is often credited with being either directly or largely responsible for the current resurgence of interest in mythology. It has been called \"super-cool\" (The Hindu), \"a milestone\" (India Today) and \"a magnificent labor of love\" (Outlook) and appeared on most major recommended reading lists during its publication. The first series fiction to find such success in Indian publishing, it has since been followed by numerous imitators, spawning the burgeoning mythology genre. At least one Indian publisher, Westland Books, has capitalised on the success of Banker's Ramayana Series by publishing other authors such as Amish Tripathi and Ashwin Sanghi, finally signing on the \"epic Indian storyteller\" himself in 2012 for his 18-volume Mahabharata Series.\n\nBanker has been credited as the creator and sole scriptwriter (story, screenplay and dialogues) for \"A Mouthful of Sky\", India's first television series in English, originally aired on DD Metro in the Indian sub-continent, retelecast on Star World. Subsequently, the series was telecast in over 30 countries worldwide and ran for 252 half-hour episodes. Banker was also co-writer of Malaysia's television series in English, titled City of the Rich, produced by UTV. The creator of several dozen successful and award-winning advertising commercials, documentaries and docudramas, including the multiple award-winning Whose World Is It Anyway, for which he also wrote several original songs. Writing sporadically for television from the mid 1980s onwards, Banker scripted over 520 episodes of broadcast television for various series. He is also credited or thanked in numerous Hindi language feature films and at least one English-language animated films for his contributions to story, or script. Banker has also contributed creative consultancy or story and/or screenplay inputs to several historical or mythological series. His work has been optioned for adaptation to television or film several times over the years, usually with Banker himself attached as screenwriter. He is reported to have several television shows in development and production, including the highly successful historical TV show \"Chakravartin Ashoka Samrat\" on Colors.\n\nMany of Banker's original screenplays have been optioned or purchased for production but remain unproduced to date due to the daunting budgets required to bring his epic stories to the big screen. His original English-language screenplay Sid is an inspired retelling of the life of Gautama Buddha reborn in present-day America; it was optioned in 2009 by Excel Entertainment to be produced and directed by Farhan Akhtar. His original graphic novel script titled Becoming Kali was purchased by DC Comics in 2010. The film rights were purchased for development by Warner Bros in 2011. In June 2013, Disney UTV purchased the rights to Banker's ongoing Mahabharata Series, with Banker commissioned to adapt the epic himself in an original screenplay intended for a big-budget live-action feature film adaptation in Hindi and Sanskrit, to be split into two parts for release in 2016/17. Disney India CEO Siddhartha Roy Kapur is attached to produce and Director Abhishek Kapoor is signed to direct the film. Banker has also confirmed that he has been commissioned by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to write the script for his forthcoming film, tentatively titled \"Raja\". At the launch of Banker's historical fiction novel Ten Kings in Chennai, filmstar Kamalhaasan was asked if he was adapting the book to the screen, but Kamalhaasan denied the rumour on camera and in subsequent interviews.\n\nOne of the first Indian authors to embrace changing technology, Banker began sharing his work online with readers as early as 1995, when public internet access began in India. He has been credited as the author of the first ebook by an Indian author, the first online serial novel, the first multimedia novel, and numerous other early experiments with digital publishing. In response to increasing demand from his readers and the considerable delay by Indian publishers in embracing electronic publishing technologies, Banker began publishing and distributing ebook editions of his own work through his website and later through a dedicated ebookstore. The result was India's first ebook best-sellers and first successful independent ebookstore. As of May 2014, AKB eBOOKS had sold over 180,000 ebooks accounting for about 9% of Banker's total book sales. As a result, Banker has said he intends to use the knowledge he has acquired in the course of researching and writing his epic mythology series into creating \"informative, interactive books for the iPad\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrequel Series\nMahabharata Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Initially, as per its royal charter, it acted as the central bank for British India prior to the formation of the Reserve Bank of India in 1935.\n\nThe Imperial Bank of India came into existence on 27 January 1921 through the reorganisation and amalgamation of the three Presidency Banks of colonial India into a single banking entity. The decision of his majesty's government was certainly influenced by the 1912 book \"Indian Currency and Finance\" authored by John Maynard Keynes. The Presidency Banks were the Bank of Bengal, established on 2 June 1806, the Bank of Bombay (incorporated on 15 April 1840), and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on 1 July 1843). The Imperial Bank was 80% privately owned while the rest were owned by the state.\n\nThe Imperial Bank of India performed all the normal functions which a commercial bank was expected to perform. In the absence of any central banking institution in India until 1935, the Imperial Bank of India also performed a number of functions which are normally carried out by a central bank.\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, which is the central bank of India, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, which was renamed on 30 April 1955 to the State Bank of India. This transformation from the Imperial Bank of India to the State Bank of India was given legal recognition through an Act of the Parliament of India, which came into force from 1 July 1955. On that day, the bank had 480 branches and sub-offices, as well as three local head offices; slightly more than a quarter of the resources of the Indian banking industry was under its control and command. The branch network of the State Bank of India has since grown to 24050 branches as of 31 March 2018. In 2007, the Reserve Bank of India transferred its stake in the State Bank of India to the Indian Government.\n\n\n"}

Marie Josèphe was the mother of three kings of France, including Louis XVI, as well as Madame Élisabeth.\n\nMaria Josepha was born on 4 November 1731 in Dresden Castle to Augustus III, Prince-Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, and Maria Josepha of Austria. Maria Josepha was the ninth of sixteen children and the fifth daughter.\n\nDauphin Louis, eldest son of King Louis XV of France, was widowed on 22 July 1746 when his wife, Maria Teresa Rafaela, died giving birth to their only child, a daughter named after herself. King Ferdinand VI of Spain, Maria Teresa Rafaela's half-brother, had offered the Dauphin another Spanish princess, Maria Antonietta. Instead, the King of France and his all-powerful mistress Madame de Pompadour wanted to open up diplomatic channels.\n\nThe marriage between Maria Josepha and the Dauphin had first been suggested by her uncle Maurice de Saxe. Louis XV and his mistress were convinced that the marriage would be advantageous to French foreign affairs. France and Saxony had been on opposing sides in the recent War of the Austrian Succession and thus the marriage between the Saxon princess and the Dauphin would form a new alliance between the two nations. There was one problem with the suggested bride: Maria Josepha's grandfather Augustus II of Poland had deposed Stanisław I Leszczyński from the Polish throne. Leszczyński was the father of Maria Leszczyńska, Louis XV's wife and mother of the Dauphin. The marriage was said to have humiliated the simple-living Queen, even though she and Maria Josepha would later get on well.\n\nOther proposals came from Savoy in the form of Princess Eleonora of Savoy or her sister Maria Luisa of Savoy. Both were refused. Despite the disapproval of the Queen, Maria Josepha married the Dauphin on 9 February 1747.\n\nPrior to the marriage, tradition demanded that the bride wear a bracelet which had a picture of her father on it; the Queen seeing the Dauphine asked to see the bracelet. The witty Maria Josepha then revealing the bracelet to the Queen showed a portrait of the Queen's father. The Dauphine said that the portrait represented the fact that the Duke of Lorraine was Maria Josepha's grandfather by marriage. The Queen and the court were strongly impressed by the tact of this girl of 15 years. The Dauphine was also very close to her father-in-law Louis XV.\n\nAt the time of the marriage, the Dauphin was still grieving for his Spanish wife. This grief was very public on the part of the Dauphin but Maria Josepha was praised greatly for her conquering the heart of the Dauphin \"bit by bit\". Despite Maria Josepha being the patient wife, the Dauphin's grief worsened in April 1748 when his only child with the Infanta died at the age of two. The Dauphin was deeply affected by the child's death. Maria Josepha later commissioned a painting (now lost) of her stepdaughter to be left over her cradle.\n\nThe new Dauphine was very grateful to Madame de Pompadour for helping arrange her marriage, and always maintained a good relationship with the royal mistress.\n\nLike her husband, Maria Josepha was very devout. Together with her mother-in-law, she formed a counterbalance to the libertine behaviour of her father-in-law and his court. The couple were not fond of the various entertainments held at Versailles every week, preferring to stay in their apartments which can still be seen on the ground floor of Versailles overlooking the \"Orangerie\".\n\nThe couple's first child was a daughter, born in 1750 on the feast day of Saint Zephyrinus and named Marie Zéphyrine. The birth was greeted with much joy by her parents even though Louis XV had been disappointed the child was not a male. She died in 1755. Their second child, Louis, was born on 15 September 1751. The royal couple concentrated so much time and energy on their eldest son that their other children suffered from neglect. He died on 22 March 1761 after having fallen from a toy horse. He started limping and a tumour began to grow on his hip. This was operated on, but he never recovered the use of his legs. The couple's second son, Xavier, was born in 1753, and died a year later. As a result, their third son, Louis Auguste, born on 23 August 1754, became second in line to the French throne after his father.\n\nThanks to Maria Josepha's close relationship with the King and the Dauphin, the relationship between father and son was soon repaired. The Dauphin was at the center of the \"Dévots\", a group of religious-minded men who hoped to gain power when he succeeded to the throne. They were against the way Louis XV openly had affairs at court in blatant view of the Queen. Naturally they were not popular with Louis XV.\n\nHer father-in-law named his loving daughter-in-law \"la triste Pepa\"; in 1756, Frederick II of Prussia invaded her native Saxony and that started the Seven Years' War, which France later joined. Politically reserved, she exerted herself only once, in 1762, in vain, for the preservation of the Society of Jesus in France. The Society had been dissolved by order of the Parlement of Paris, inspired by Jansenist magistrates, against the will of the King.\n\nThe death of her husband, on 20 December 1765, dealt Maria Josepha a devastating blow from which she never recovered, sinking into a deep depression which lasted till her own death 15 months later. To save her the torment of remaining with memories of her dead husband, Louis XV re-arranged the allocation of apartments within Versailles, so that Maria Josepha moved out of the apartments that she had shared with her husband and into the apartments of Madame de Pompadour, who had died in 1764. There, the king visited her more than he had in the past, paid her many kind attentions, and discussed with her the possible wedding of her son, the new dauphin. Maria Josepha was not pleased with the idea of her eldest son marrying a daughter of Maria Theresa of Austria, in whose favour Maria Josepha's own mother (a cousin of Maria Theresa) had been disinherited.\n\nSoon, Maria Josepha's health declined. She died on 13 March 1767 of tuberculosis, and was buried in the Cathedral of Saint-Étienne in Sens. The marriage of her son, the future Louis XVl, with Maria Theresa's daughter Marie Antoinette was celebrated three years later.\n\n\n"}

Maragogi was initially a small village called Gamela. In 1887, it was granted the status of an adopted the name of Isabel, to honor the Brazilian Princess who signed a law ending slavery in Brazil. Later on, in 1892, it was named as Maragogi after the river that baths the city. \"Maragogi\", according to some historians, comes from “Marahub-gy”, or river of the Marauba tribes.\n\nMaragogi has a typical tropical climate, with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year.

The municipality is the second most visited city after Maceio the state capital of Alagoas.\n\nIts major attraction is the \"Galés\", a group of tropical pools formed at low tide about 6 kilometers from the city's beach. They are served by 15 large registered catamarans leaving from various points in the municipal area. Individual tours are also available.\n\nIn 2015 the city started to host sports events, with the launching of the first Trail Running competition on the region: the WINGSMAN Maragogi and then started to become the destination for adventure and outdoors tourism along with the traditional tourist looking for the best beaches in the country. \nMaragogi's history includes the battles between Dutch and Portuguese colonizers as well as the growth of the sugar cane and coconut plantations that formed the first wealth of the region. Today, it is tourism that provides the most important economic impact in the region. But, its potential remains unexplored. Even so, the busy waterfront in the City of Maragogi has a variety of restaurants, stores and stalls selling local arts and crafts.\n\nTrips to snorkel or scuba dive the reefs can be interspersed by excursions on the reefs themselves or a sail (or even fish) on the local \"jangada\" sailing rafts. The deserted beaches of Maragogi and other rural attractions can be accessed by renting beach buggies readily available at the hotels and pousadas.\n\nBeaches in Maragogi have calm waters, without strong waves, with coral reefs and fine sands. During low tide, sand banks emerge forming natural pools, known as Croas (5 km away from the coast) and Galés (6 km away). \"Jangadas\" and boats can take tourists to these pools. On the beach's southern tip, between Vila de Japaratinga and Pontal, visitors find the less urbanized beaches with 20-m high sea cliffs. Visitors can also go on a boat ride to coral reefs 6 km away from the coast. Maragogi beach is near Maragogi River, with calm waves, flat sands and coral reefs.\n\n"}

He is the older brother of major league catchers José Molina and Yadier Molina.\n\nInitially regarded as a \"good glove, no hit\" catcher with a strong arm and an exceptional ball blocker, Molina won a Gold Glove as the top defensive player at his position in consecutive seasons in and . But he also developed into a very good contact hitter and free-swinging power hitter. Between 2000 and 2007, he struck out just 331 times, and in 2000 led the American League in average at-bats between strikeouts, with 14.3. He is the only player in history to hit a home run and not get credit for the run. He was regarded as one of the slowest baserunners of his day.\nBengie currently provides color commentary on the Spanish language radio broadcast for the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nMolina graduated from Maestro Ladí High School with honors in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, and played shortstop for Arizona Western College in Yuma, Arizona, in 1991 and 1992.\n\nMolina entered the major leagues by playing two games for the Anaheim Angels in , and a handful of games in . He became the Angels' regular catcher in 2000 and remained so through the season. Over his last few seasons with the Angels, his backup as catcher was his brother, José Molina. Molina got his first championship ring in 2002 after the Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in seven games in the 2002 World Series.\n\nMolina's contract with the Angels expired after the 2005 season, and the team decided not pursue him because of the salary he would demand. He signed a 1-year $5 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, with a mutual option for a second year. After signing with the Blue Jays, Molina expressed his anger at the Angels over how he parted company with them. \"The way they let me go without a notice, without calling me, that said a lot,\" Molina said. \"That's what really hurts me. I think I built a good relationship with them,\" he said. \"They never let me know. They just threw me like a piece of trash.\" Molina's agent, Alan Nero, later confirmed however, that both he and Molina had in fact received calls from the Angels informing them of the team's decisions. Nero suggested that Molina's comments were born of his disappointment that he was not retained by the Angels.\n\nWhile Molina was expected to catch most of the Jays' season with Gregg Zaun serving as his backup, his difficulties with right-handed pitchers led the Jays to use a platoon system.\n\nAfter the 2006 season, Molina became a free agent and signed a three-year, $16 million deal with the San Francisco Giants.\n\nMolina hit his 100th home run on September 5, 2007, off Jorge Julio in the sixth inning of a 5–3 victory against the Colorado Rockies.\nMolina was announced as the Willie Mac Award winner for 2007 (for spirit and leadership) in a pregame ceremony on September 21, 2007. He got the most out of 1,617 votes from the fans. Later in that September 21 game, Molina knocked in career RBI number 500 in the bottom of the first on a single that scored Dave Roberts. They lost the game to the Cincinnati Reds 9–8 in 11 innings. In 2007, Molina walked only 2.9% of the time, the lowest percentage in the NL.\n\nOn September 26, 2008, Molina became the first player in MLB history to hit a home run and not get credit for a run scored. In the 6th inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he hit a ball off the right field wall at AT&T Park which the umpire called in fair play, and wound up at first base. Emmanuel Burriss immediately ran out to first base to pinch run for Molina before anyone else could intervene, as Giants manager Bruce Bochy discussed the matter with the umpires. However, the umpires used instant replay and subsequently ruled the hit a home run, but refused Bochy the opportunity to reinsert Molina into the game. San Francisco continued the game under protest, but won 6–5 in the 10th inning. Preceding the same game, Molina had received the Willie Mac Award for the second year in a row.\n\nIn 2009, he led the majors in sacrifice flies (with 11), and walked in only 2.5% of his plate appearances, the lowest percentage in majors for those with qualifying plate appearances.\n\nOn January 19, 2010, Molina re-signed a 1-year $4.5 million contract with the San Francisco Giants.\n\nFollowing one of the Giants' longer losing streaks of the season, and the sudden emergence of rookie catcher Buster Posey, Molina was traded to the Texas Rangers on June 30, 2010, for relief pitcher Chris Ray and a player to be named later, which was minor league RHP Michael Main. As two of the Giants' best pitchers commented upon Molina's departure, his contributions to the Giants were very significant. \"He helped me mature and succeed. I've said time and time again that he deserves half of those awards that I've gotten,\" said Tim Lincecum, the reigning two-time National League Cy Young Award winner. \"The things he's done for me – for calling a game, to give me confidence throwing different pitches in different counts – really, really, really benefited me,\" Matt Cain said of Molina.\n\nNotorious for his lack of baserunning ability, on July 16, 2010, Molina hit for the cycle against Boston. He had (in order) a single, double, home run (grand slam), and triple. He was then pinch run for and left the game in the top of the 8th inning after hitting the triple, with a leg injury. He is the fifth Texas Ranger to hit for the cycle. He is also the first catcher in MLB history to hit a grand slam and hit for the cycle in the same game.\n\nDuring the 2010 American League Division Series Molina (again despite his poor baserunning ability) stole a base in Game 5, his first in over four years. He also hit a home run in Game 1.\n\nIn Game 4 of the 2010 American League Championship Series, with 2 outs in the 6th inning and the Rangers trailing the New York Yankees, 3–2, Molina hit a three-run home run off A. J. Burnett. The home run, arguably one of the most important in Rangers history, proved to be the game-winner for the Rangers and gave the underdog Rangers a commanding 3–1 lead in the series. The Rangers won the ALCS against the Yankees in six games, which allowed the Rangers to enter the World Series for the first time in franchise history.\n\nSince the Texas Rangers made it to the World Series, along with the San Francisco Giants, Molina became the sixth player to play for the two World Series teams in the same season. Due to having played for both Giants and Rangers during the 2010 season, Molina was guaranteed to receive a World Series ring regardless of whether his current or former team won the World Series. In the 2010 World Series, Molina batted only .182 with one RBI. The Rangers eventually lost the World Series to the Giants in five games. After the season was over, Molina was released as a free agent.\n\nMolina spent most of the 2011 season on free agency and eventually retired.\n\nAfter his retirement, Molina accepted the Cardinals' offer on December 14, 2012 to be their assistant hitting coach to John Mabry.\n\nMolina joined the Rangers' coaching staff for the 2014 season as their first base coach and catching instructor.\n"}

Rogers played college football for the University of South Carolina, earned All-America honors, and won the 1980 Heisman Trophy. He was the first overall pick in the 1981 NFL Draft, and he played professionally for the New Orleans Saints and Washington Redskins of the NFL. As a professional, Rogers rushed for over 7,000 yards.\n\nRogers was highly recruited out of high school, and decided to attend the University of South Carolina when coach Jim Carlen told him that he could play in his freshman year. Due to his large size, he seemed destined to play fullback rather than tailback. However, the Gamecocks had two running backs who graduated at the same time, so he began his college career as the starting tailback midway through his freshman season.\n\nRogers rushed for 1,006 yards (playing in only eight games) during his sophomore year, despite splitting time with fellow sophomore Johnnie Wright. In Rogers' junior campaign, he had 1,681 rushing yards. After that season, he was given first-team All-America honors by the Associated Press and Newspaper Enterprise Association, and second-team honors from United Press International. He finished seventh in voting for the Heisman Trophy.\n\nIn 1980, the stage was set when the Gamecocks returned plenty of talent, which was headlined by senior and Heisman candidate Rogers. South Carolina finished the season with an 8–3 record. Rogers' 1,781 rushing yards was the best in the nation and earned him a spot as a finalist for the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThe Downtown Athletic Club in New York City named Rogers as the winner of the 1980 Heisman Trophy. Rogers beat out an impressive group of players, including Pittsburgh defensive lineman Hugh Green and Georgia running back Herschel Walker. Rogers also earned spots on eight All-America teams, all first-team honors.\n\nRogers had his number 38 retired during halftime ceremonies at South Carolina's final 1980 home game. He was the first University of South Carolina player to have his jersey retired while still active at the school.\n\nRogers left the Gamecocks football program as its most successful running back, and many of his records remain after all these years. His 5,204 yards is still the highest career total by any Gamecock running back, and his 31 rushing touchdowns is tied with Harold Green for second. He is second on the all-time points scored list, with 202. He also gained more than 100 yards in each of his final 22 college games.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Includes bowl games.\n\nIn the 1981 NFL Draft the New Orleans Saints selected Rogers with the first pick overall (one pick before the New York Giants selected Lawrence Taylor). He was the first of five Heisman Trophy winners selected by the Saints (Danny Wuerffel in 1997, Ricky Williams in 1999, Reggie Bush in 2006 and Mark Ingram Jr. in 2011 were the other four).\n\nIn his first season, Rogers led the league in rushing with 1,674 yards, which set a record for rookies and is still the single season record for the Saints. He earned a trip to the Pro Bowl and was selected as the NFL Rookie of the Year.\n\nRogers spent his first four seasons in New Orleans. He played alongside quarterback Archie Manning in 1981 and eventually running back Earl Campbell, who was brought in during the 1984 season.\n\nOn April 26, 1985 Rogers was traded to the Washington Redskins together with the Saints' fifth-, tenth- and 11th-round selections in the 1985 NFL Draft in return for the Redskins first-round pick.\n\nRogers played three more seasons, all for the Washington Redskins. When he arrived in Washington, Pro Football Hall of Fame running back John Riggins was ending his professional career, while coach Joe Gibbs was trying to rebuild the team after the retirement of Riggins and quarterback Joe Theismann. Rogers had some of his biggest professional success in Washington, including a Super Bowl title in 1987, defeating the Denver Broncos, 42–10, in Super Bowl XXII. Rogers retired due to nagging injuries after the 1987 season, ending his professional career with the Super Bowl victory. When he left the NFL, Rogers had rushed for 7,176 yards with 54 touchdowns in seven seasons. Rogers ranks second all-time to Eric Dickerson on the single season rookie rushing yards record with 1,674 yards.\n\nFollowing his rookie season with the Saints, Rogers testified to a federal grand jury during an investigation into trafficking by another Saints player, that he along with other teammates had purchased and used cocaine during his rookie season with the Saints in 1981. He claimed to have spent more than $10,000 on cocaine during the season. He checked himself into a drug treatment center for cocaine addiction in 1982. Rogers claimed after a clean urine test in July 1982 while still in rehab, that he had stopped using the drug. In April 1990, George Rogers was arrested along with two other men in Columbia, South Carolina. All three were charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of marijuana. All were released after posting $5,000 bonds. Since then, he appears to have overcome those problems and works at his alma mater in public relations and fund-raising and speaks out against the drug culture.\n\nIn 1992, Rogers was named to the All-Century Team at University of South Carolina. He holds memberships in the University of South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame, South Carolina Football Hall of Fame, the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, and the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame. In 1997, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Also, the road that runs along the north end of Williams-Brice Stadium was renamed in his honor and is now known as George Rogers Boulevard. A statue of Rogers was erected on the boulevard in 2015.\n\nDecember 14, 2017 Rogers will have another road named after him (George Rogers Avenue) in his hometown of Duluth, Georgia.\n\n\n"}

It belongs to the true woodcreepers (tribe Dendrocolaptini) of the ovenbird family (Furnariidae).\n\nIt is the only member of the genus \"Sittasomus\", but includes 15 vocally and morphologically distinct subspecies in 5 groups, some of which are candidates for a future split.\n\nThis small woodcreeper is a slender bird, typically long, and weighing . The head, upper back and underparts are lighter or darker greyish olive, and the wings, tail and lower back are light rufous. The bill is short and thin.\n\nThe normal call is a fast, high-pitched trill \"wu-wu-wu-we-we-we-we-ee-ee-ee-ee-we-we-we-we\", but this varies geographically.\n\nIt breeds from southern Mexico through tropical Central and South America to northern Argentina and Uruguay, and also on Tobago. The species is found throughout the Amazon basin, but is absent from its lowest reaches, including much of the adjacent Guyanas.\n\nThere, the subspecies of the northeastern Amazon (\"S. g. axillaris\") ranges at least to the Pakaraima Mountains, where it is fairly common at ASL, descending to about ASL on occasion. The olivaceous woodcreeper has also been recorded from extreme southern Guyana and the Essequibo River (which may be its eastern limit in the region). It is apparently completely absent from eastern Guyana eastwards through Suriname and French Guiana.\n\nIn Uruguay, the olivaceous woodcreeper was found for the first time in 1997 in the gallery forests of the Yaguarón River, in Cerro Largo Department. Since then, it has also been recorded near Cuchilla de Mangrullo, as well as in the Sierra de los Ríos.\n\nThe olivaceous woodcreeper is a common and widespread bird of forests and other woodlands. It feeds on insects and spiders. It normally forages on tree trunks or large branches or on the ground, usually singly.\n\nThese birds may associate with foraging groups of golden lion tamarins (\"Leontopithecus rosalia\") to snatch prey startled by the monkeys. They can also be occasionally seen catching flying prey like termites in mid-air, and will sometimes join mixed-species feeding flocks. In some places (e.g. in the Serra de Paranapiacaba of Brazil), they may even form a core species of such flocks.\n\nIt builds a nest lined with dead leaves in a tree hole and lays three white eggs.\n\nDue to its extremely wide range, the olivaceous woodcreeper is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.\n\n\n"}

He was the Boies Professor of United States History at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHackney was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1933, and educated in the Birmingham public school system. He was a graduate of Ramsay High School. After graduating from Vanderbilt University, Hackney earned his Ph.D. in American History at Yale University, where he worked with eminent Southern historian C. Vann Woodward. He subsequently served in the Navy for five years.\n\nHackney began his career as a lecturer in history at Princeton University. There, he taught in an Upward Bound program for disadvantaged students and played a role in the creation of the university's African American Studies program. While at Princeton, he moved into administration, serving as the provost from 1972 to 1975. \n\nFrom 1975 to 1980, Hackney was the president of Tulane University. At Tulane, Hackney was best known for approving the November 1979 decision to tear down Tulane Stadium, the on-campus home of the Green Wave football team from 1926 through 1974. The Wave moved to the Louisiana Superdome upon its completion in August 1975. Tulane Stadium stood vacant for nearly five years after Tulane and the NFL's New Orleans Saints played their final games there, hosting high school football games and an ill-fated ZZ Top concert in 1976.\n\nHackney was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993. He was also the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1993 to 1997, appointed by President Clinton. His defining initiative in the job was his first: \"A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity,\" a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997.\n\nHackney specialized in the history of the American South since the Civil War.

He played for four teams in MLB, and for the Puerto Rican national team in the World Baseball Classic (WBC). Noted for his abilities in pitch-framing and in handling pitching staffs, Molina is a two-time World Series champion in MLB and a two-time silver medalist with Puerto Rico.\n\nMolina is the middle of three brothers (older brother Bengie and younger brother Yadier), all of whom have played catcher in Major League Baseball. They are the only three brothers in MLB history to all win World Series rings. Bengie and José did it together as members of the 2002 Anaheim Angels, and Yadier with the 2006 and 2011 Cardinals. José later won a second ring with the 2009 New York Yankees.\n\nMolina graduated from Maestro Ladi High School in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico in 1993, and attended Ladislao Martinez High School in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico.\n\nMolina was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 14th round of the 1993 amateur draft. His first major league team was the Cubs, for which he played 10 games as a September callup in 1999.\n\nHe joined the then-Anaheim Angels in 2001 as a free agent, but played only a handful of games before establishing himself during the 2002 season as the Angels backup catcher for his brother, Bengie.\n\nIn 2002, Molina got his first World Series ring as the Angels won the 2002 World Series against the San Francisco Giants.\n\nIn 2005, he hit a career-best six home runs, and tied his career-high with 25 RBI, as he hit .306 against lefties.\n\nFollowing Bengie's departure from the Angels, Molina entered the 2006 season as the Angels' new starting catcher, though it was expected that rookie Jeff Mathis would also see substantial time handling the team's catching duties over the course of the season. However, Mathis struggled during the first month of the season and, as a result, he was ultimately demoted to the minor leagues. Molina himself then struggled offensively, and the promising offensive performance of Mathis' replacement on the roster, rookie Mike Napoli, once again relegated Molina to the role of backup catcher. Still, he played in a career-high 78 games and had a career-best 225 at-bats in 2006.\n\nOn July 21, 2007, Molina was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league pitcher Jeff Kennard. At the time of the trade, he had a .237 lifetime batting average, but had hit lefties much better (.269). He would go on to hit .318 for the Yankees with 1 home run.\n\nOn December 3, 2007, the Yankees signed Molina to a two-year deal. He served as the team's starting catcher following a shoulder injury to Jorge Posada, but returned to the backup role when the Yankees acquired Iván Rodríguez.\n\nMolina was successful in eight of nine sacrifice bunt attempts in 2008. On September 21, 2008, Molina hit the last home run in the original Yankee Stadium, in the Yankees' final game at the ballpark, which was against the Baltimore Orioles. Following this event, Molina expressed satisfaction at being the final answer to the question presented by Babe Ruth in his last public speech at the facility, which closed by stating, \"I was glad to have hit the first home run in this park. God only knows who will hit the last.\" Controversy emerged around the home run ball hit by Molina in a dispute regarding ownership involving fans and Yankee Stadium security. Later in 2008, the ball would come to auction, where it was estimated by auctioneer Guernsey's at $200,000-$300,000. ESPN stated \"[the ball] was expected to fetch up to $400,000, but was pulled after offers fell short of the suggested opening bid of $100,000.\" and blamed the economic crisis of 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Molina again served as the Yankees' primary backup catcher, catching most of A. J. Burnett's games when possible and hitting .219 in 138 at bats (52 games). On October 29, 2009 in Game two of the 2009 World Series, he picked off Jayson Werth at first base becoming the first Yankees catcher to pick a baserunner off in the World Series since Yogi Berra who did the same in the 1950 World Series, also against the Philadelphia Phillies. Molina got his second World Series ring as the Yankees defeated the Phillies in the 2009 World Series in 6 games.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, Molina signed a one-year contract that included an option for 2011 with the Toronto Blue Jays. He had one of his best offensive seasons in 2010, producing a .681 OPS with 6 home runs over 57 games.\n\nMolina returned to the Blue Jays for the 2011 season, providing veteran guidance to rookie J. P. Arencibia. The club picked up his option for $1.2 million.\n\nIn a rarely seen lineup move, Molina was named the designated hitter on May 27, 2011 against the White Sox. In addition to getting three hits off Mark Buehrle, Molina and Rajai Davis executed a double steal; this was only Molina's 11th stolen base in his 12-year career.\n\nOn November 28, 2011, Molina signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. After posting a .223 average with 8 home runs and 32 RBI, Molina's 2013 contract option for $1.8 million was picked up by the Rays. On December 2, 2013, after another season with Tampa Bay in which he hit .233 with 2 home runs and 18 RBI, Molina signed a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Rays.\n\nMolina was released on November 24, 2014.\n\nOn November 6, 2015, Molina was hired as the minor league catching coordinator for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to work with catchers in their farm system.\n\nIn the minors, Molina was rated as the best defensive catcher in the Pacific Coast League by \"Baseball America\" in 2002. In his years with the Cubs and Angels, he displayed better than average range as a catcher, and also played 9 games at first base. In 2004, he threw out 22 of 45 base stealers (48.89%), tops in the AL (minimum of 40 attempts). He also led AL catchers with five pickoffs in 2004, despite only 57 starts. In 2005, he caught more than half of those who attempted to steal against him, again the best percentage in the AL. In 2008, he again played excellent defense, and displayed his excellent arm, replacing the injured Jorge Posada.\n\nIn a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on April 25, 2010, Molina set a Blue Jays club record by throwing out four attempted basestealers in one game, including defending American League basestealing champion Carl Crawford, who was thrown out twice. This was the first time an AL catcher had caught four basestealers in one game since Terry Steinbach in 1992.\n\nMolina earned a silver medal as a backup catcher to his brother Yadier on the Puerto Rican team during the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\n\n"}

For many years his mother, a former actress, ran a small theatre in L.A. His father, who died in 1990, was a photographer. When Erickson was a child he stuttered badly and teachers believed he couldn't read.

For a few years he worked as a freelance writer for alternative weekly newspapers. His first novel, \"Days Between Stations,\" was published in 1985. Along with two non-fiction books, \"Leap Year\" and \"American Nomad\", Erickson has published a total of ten novels in a dozen languages, and there are unconfirmed rumors that 2017's \"Shadowbahn\" may be his last. Erickson himself appeared briefly as a fictional character in Michael Ventura's 1996 novel, \"The Death of Frank Sinatra\".\n\nErickson has written for the \"New York Times Magazine\", \"Esquire\", \"Smithsonian\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"Conjunctions\", \"American Prospect\" and \"Los Angeles\" magazine among others, and twice has been a finalist for the National Magazine Award. For fourteen years he was founding editor of the literary journal \"Black Clock\" until it ceased publication in 2016. He is a Distinguished Professor at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nConsidered a \"writer's writer,\" Erickson frequently is regarded as one of America's great living novelists even as readers in his country remain unfamiliar with him. His work has been cited by Thomas Pynchon, Haruki Murakami, David Foster Wallace, Dana Spiotta, Neil Gaiman, Richard Powers, Kathy Acker, Jonathan Lethem, William Gibson and Mark Z. Danielewski. Cultural essayist Greil Marcus has called Erickson \"the only authentic American surrealist,\" and Rick Moody has declared Erickson \"in the league of Pynchon, DeLillo, Atwood, Rushdie, Okri, Pamuk, Ondaatje, Lethem—a maximal visionary.\" In characterizing his influences, Erickson was quoted early in his career as stating:When I think of writers who have had an impact on me, I come up with people that never get named [by my reviewers]. Faulkner, Henry Miller, the Brontës, Stendhal, Paul Bowles, Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler. I would have to include in that group Márquez, who is one writer that has been cited, and you've probably got to include in that group Pynchon, simply because Pynchon is a little like Joyce. His influence is so pervasive these days that you can't help but be influenced by him. Erickson's \"Tours of the Black Clock\" appears on critic Larry McCaffery's list of the . In a winter 2008 poll by the National Book Critics Circle of 800 novelists and writers, \"Zeroville\" was named one of the five favorite novels of the previous year. In the December 2015 issue of \"Granta\", Lethem called the then-still-unpublished \"Shadowbahn\" the best American novel of whatever year in which it was ultimately released.\n\nBBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of \"Shadowbahn\" as part of its \"Dangerous Visions\" series in June 2018. A motion picture adaptation of \"Zeroville\" starring James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jacki Weaver and Megan Fox was released in September 2019.\n\nErickson lives with his family in Topanga Canyon, California.\n\nErickson's novels revolve around controversial and sometimes misunderstood concepts. One is slavery, both actual and metaphorical. \"Arc d'X\" begins with the story of the love affair between Thomas Jefferson and a slave girl, Sally Hemings. In a number of Erickson's novels men are profoundly trapped by what they seek or purport to possess, and in virtually all of his novels—particularly \"The Sea Came in at Midnight\" and \"Our Ecstatic Days\" where female characters dominate—a female protagonist is the catalytic figure who sets events into motion. Another important theme in Erickson's novels is parenthood and the loss of a child. \"Our Ecstatic Days\" follows a mother's search for her missing son over the course of a quarter century. The Occupant from \"The Sea Came in at Midnight\" is left by his wife and child. In \"Days Between Stations\" Adolphe and Maurice Sarre are abandoned by their mother and Lauren's son Jules dies. The profound estrangement from his father of \"Zeroville\"'s central character, Vikar, leads to his obsession with movies, and later he becomes a paternal figure to the teenage Zazi after her mother dies. In \"These Dreams of You\", the adoptive parents of the four-year-old Ethiopian orphan Sheba set out to find the girl's birth mother; in turn Sheba and her brother reappear twelve years older in \"Shadowbahn\" on a road trip to reunite with their mother and reconcile with the memory of their father.\n\nSometimes Erickson relies on autobiographical information filtered through an unconventional imagination. \"Amnesiascope\" is almost a memoir in which actual people and events from Erickson's life mix with his imagination. Recurring themes are music (in \"These Dreams of You\" and \"Shadowbahn\") and filmmaking, presented from the perspective of a director (\"Days Between Stations\" and \"The Sea Came in at Midnight\"), screenwriter (\"Rubicon Beach\"), critic (\"Amnesiascope\") and film editor (\"Zeroville\"). Often the films are transgressive and rejected by the audience.\n\n\"For all his time-traveling, his dream logic, his cinematic jump-cuts, his erotic interludes, his post apocalyptic future worlds,\" Sarah Vowell wrote for \"Salon\" in 2000, \"...[Erickson's] narrative voice never quite sheds its fundamental idealism.\" The preeminent theme of America dominates Erickson's novels from \"Rubicon Beach\" to \"Amnesiascope\" to \"These Dreams of You\", culminating with \"Shadowbahn\". Some of this work that has been described as apocalyptic now appears prescient. Since the late 1980s these stories have anticipated America's political crumbling and the slow obliteration of the world in which Erickson's characters live. Long before general public awareness of climate change, nature itself became an alien force out of control in Erickson's books (the long winter in Paris, sand storms in L.A. and the disappearance of water in Venice and the Mediterranean region in \"Days Between Stations\"; the earthquake in \"Amnesiascope\"; the lake that floods L.A. in both \"Rubicon Beach\" and \"Our Ecstatic Days\"; the vanishing rain in \"Shadowbahn\"). The characters of the novels often live in metropoles—L.A., New York City, Berlin, Paris or Tokyo—in which unexpected natural phenomena cause chaos and reveal how brittle civilization actually is. Erickson makes occasional use of somewhat supernatural elements such as bizarre artifacts (a bottle with human eyes from \"Days Between Stations\"), the extraordinary gifts of some characters (Catherine from \"Rubicon Beach\"), and impossible historical events (the Twin Towers' reappearance in the Dakota Badlands from \"Shadowbahn\"). The most powerful force of Erickson's universe is love, often passionate, sensual, overpowering, unstoppable. Lovers hurt each other but at the same time cannot live without each other. When the love is lost, people become empty, bitter or full of hatred. The affection is almost like possession.\n\nErickson's characters appear in multiple books. Besides the children of \"These Dreams of You\" who are grown in \"Shadowbahn\", Adolphe Sarre from \"Days Between Stations\" is alluded to in \"Zeroville\" and \"Amnesiascope\", Lauren from \"Days Between Stations\" reappears briefly in \"Arc d'X\", and Carl has recurring cameos in \"Days Between Stations\", \"Tours of the Black Clock\", \"Amnesiascope\" and \"The Sea Came in at Midnight\". Lauren and Janine from \"Days Between Stations\", and Catherine and Leigh from \"Rubicon Beach\", are imaginings of the protagonist in the subsequent \"Tours of the Black Clock\". Wade and Mallory from \"Rubicon Beach\" reemerge as major characters in \"Arc d’X\" as does Sally Hemings who is introduced in the supposedly nonfiction \"Leap Year\". Viv from \"Amnesiascope\" returns years later as the adoptive mother in search of her daughter's past in \"These Dreams of You\", and Maxxi Maraschino from \"The Sea Came In At Midnight\" is mentioned on a concert poster in \"Zeroville\". Kristin features in both \"The Sea Came in at Midnight\" and \"Our Ecstatic Days\" while Banning Jainlight from \"Tours of the Black Clock\" manifests as an altered incarnation with the same name in \"Our Ecstatic Days\". Cale from \"Rubicon Beach\" returns, in altered form with his name spelled Kale, in \"Our Ecstatic Days\". Erickson's friend and fellow novelist Michael Ventura shows up in \"Leap Year\", \"Amnesiascope\" and \"American Nomad\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1959 she became a trainee reporter, first on the \"Uxbridge Post\", and in the early 1960s on \"Boyfriend\", a weekly magazine for teen girls. In 1964, she joined the staff of \"Disc\", a weekly pop music magazine (later \"Disc and Music Echo\"), as a journalist and record reviewer, becoming for a time Britain's most influential reviewer of new pop singles. According to fellow journalist Richard Williams, \"She was probably the first woman to write about pop music as though it really mattered.\" She loved soul music, and supported singers such as Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye before they became famous. In 1965 she also recorded the novelty single \"I Want To Kiss Ringo Goodbye\" which celebrates The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr. As a young woman, she also wrote articles for a variety of publications on the then-current \"Swinging London\" phenomenon.

{"id": "2297679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297679", "title": "Guy J. Velella", "text": "Guy J. Velella\n\nGuy John Velella (September 25, 1944 – January 27, 2011) was a Republican New York State Senator from The Bronx.\n\nA political leader, state assemblyman, and state senator for over 30 years, Velella was indicted in 2002 on 25 counts of bribery and conspiracy for allegedly accepting at least $137,000 in exchange for steering public-works contracts to the paying parties. He ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy in the fourth degree, a class E felony, admitting that he helped clients obtain business from government agencies, and that the clients paid fees in excess of $10,000 to his father's law firm, in exchange for a year in jail. As part of the plea agreement reached with the Manhattan District Attorney, Velella resigned his seat in the State Senate and his position as Chairman of the Bronx County Republican Party. He was also disbarred. He served a total of six months (in two separate stints) of his sentence at Rikers Island.\n\nVelella was born on September 25, 1944, in East Harlem, then a heavily Italian-American neighborhood, in Manhattan. Velella's father, the late Vincent J. Velella, was a lawyer who became wealthy through real estate deals. The Velella family moved to the Bronx in the late 1950s. In 1967, Velella graduated from St. John's University, Jamaica, New York. He then earned a law degree from the Suffolk School of Law (today the Suffolk University Law School) in Boston, Massachusetts, and joined his father's law practice. \n\nIn 1972, aged 28, Velella, a Republican, ran for the New York State Assembly in the East Bronx. The incumbent Democrat withdrew from the race unexpectedly, and Velella won the race. He served in the Assembly from 1973 to 1982, sitting in the 180th, 181st, 182nd, 183rd and 184th New York State Legislatures. After redistricting, Velella found himself running in a new Democratic district in 1982, which then covered Throggs Neck and Parkchester. In a bitter campaign, he ran against popular Assemblyman and head of the Parkchester Tenants Association John C. Dearie. After losing that election by a wide margin, Velella told the \"Bronx News\", a local weekly newspaper, that he was done with politics. In January 1983, Velella returned to practicing law full-time. Despite his pledge that his political career was over, Velella was elected to the local school board. Many political observers expected Velella to run for the seat in Congress held by Mario Biaggi, a Democrat, when he retired.\n\nVelella returned to elected office on April 22, 1986, when he was elected to the New York State Senate, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John D. Calandra. The three-way race was bitter and costly, as JoAnn Calandra, Calandra's widow, backed by the late senator's partisans and patronage recipients, and hoping to capitalize on the late senator's ties to the Senate Majority establishment, sought to retain family control of the seat. The Democratic candidate, Michael Durso, also generated interest. The 34th Senate District included mostly white neighborhoods in the Bronx and parts of lower Westchester County, areas hand-picked by Calandra during the last redistricting and including portions of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and all of Pelham. Velella received the endorsements of the Right to Life Party and the Bronx section of the Conservative Party of New York.\n\nIn a battle that echoed those for the Republican nomination and the Senate Seat itself, Velella also became chairman of the Bronx Republican Party. He was subsequently re-elected to the State Senate in November 1986 and in every subsequent election until November 2002, sitting in the 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 193rd, 194th and 195th New York State Legislatures. He resigned his seat on May 14, 2004, as part of a plea bargain reached on criminal charges that he took bribes to help businesses win lucrative state contracts. According to the text of the indictment, the bribes were in the form of payments to the Velellas' law firm for little or no work.\n\nAs a state senator, Velella brought millions of state dollars into his district, which funded local projects. Velella also endeared himself to his constituents through his advocacy on their behalf with the federal, state, and city government. Velella's success in securing money for his district and excellent record on constituent service made him very popular in his district, including conservative Democrats (or \"Reagan Democrats\").\n\nAs one of the handful of Republican State Senators from New York City, Velella exercised considerable influence in the state legislature and in both Westchester County and New York City politics. Over the decades, many Democrats in the Assembly often turned to Velella to introduce their legislation in the New York State Senate, which was controlled by the Republicans from 1966 until 2009.\n\nIn 1989, Velella became chairman of the powerful Senate Insurance Committee. In this capacity, Velella secured passage of numerous laws affecting the insurance industry in New York. Velella reached the height of his influence and power during the mid-1990s. He enjoyed access to important elected officials, many of them Republicans, such as U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Governor George Pataki, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and NYS Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. Velella used his many contacts to secure patronage jobs for his supporters. Other key backers such as Bill Newmark, the chairman of the Bronx Conservative Party, joined his legislative payroll. \n\nDuring Rudy Giuliani's first mayoral bid in 1989, Velella and D'Amato acted together to deny Giuliani the support he needed to beat David Dinkins, the eventual Democratic nominee, even going so far as to engineer a completely spurious candidacy on the part of cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder to challenge Giuliani in the Republican primary. Victor B. Tosi, Velella's executive assistant and a long-time Bronx Republican activist, served as Lauder's campaign manager. Lauder lost the primary, but the nearly $13 million he spent on negative campaign commercials damaged Giuliani's candidacy.\n\nIn the general election, Velella endorsed Giuliani, who went on to lose narrowly to Dinkins. Later, when D'Amato and the Governor-Elect Pataki decided to foment a coup against then-Majority Leader Ralph Marino, who had clashed repeatedly with Pataki during the latter's brief tenure in the New York State Senate, Velella acted as Pataki's and D'Amato's agent, drafting Senate Members for a Thanksgiving coup in 1994 against Long Island's Marino and in favor of upstate Rensselaer County's Joe Bruno. This occurred even though Velella had been, upon the retirement of former Majority Leader Warren M. Anderson, one of a small circle who had helped to engineer Marino's ascension to the Leader's post and was one of Marino's most visible and rewarded allies during the ensuing years.\n\nWhile serving in the state legislature, Velella also maintained a thriving law practice, which benefited from his Senate role as Insurance Chairman. He was a partner, with his father, in Velella, Velella, Basso, and Calandra, a law firm in the Morris Park section of The Bronx. After his conviction, Velella surrendered his law license. In 2004, the law firm changed its name to Velella, Basso, and Cirrincione and then, after the retirement of Vincent Velella, to Basso and Cirrincione.\n\nIn 1987, Velella admitted that he had fathered a child out of wedlock with an Albany woman with whom he had had a longtime affair. The year before, Velella's supporters distributed campaign literature that championed him as an advocate of family values and criticized liberal Democrats for undermining sexual morality. Velella later said he had made financial arrangements with the child's mother to support his newborn daughter, Alexandra Velella.\n\nIn 1993, Velella was accused of fixing local school board elections. No criminal charges were filed.\n\nIn 1981, then-Assemblyman Velella ran for New York City Council President against the incumbent Democrat, Carol Bellamy and lost by a landslide. In 1985, Velella ran for New York City Comptroller against the three-time Democratic incumbent, Harrison J. Goldin, but also lost by a wide margin.\n\nIn 1986, Velella became the chairman of the Bronx Republican Party. He resigned that position in 2004. Critics charged that Velella did nothing to build the local GOP and maintained a \"non-aggression pact\" with the Bronx County Democratic organization. With the exception of himself, no other Republican was ever elected to any office in the Bronx during his 18-year term. In 1994 and 1996, Velella ran with the endorsement of the Bronx Democratic Party.\n\nAlthough he maintained a cordial and mutually-beneficial relationship with the Bronx Democratic political machine, Velella did work hard to get Republicans elected to prominent offices. In 1992, Velella campaigned for Senator D'Amato, who was facing a tough re-election fight against Democratic challenger, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams. D'Amato was narrowly re-elected. Velella and Giuliani put aside their previous animosity, and the Bronx Republican leader enthusiastically campaigned for him in 1993. On Election Day, Velella oversaw a \"ballot security program,\" which sought to deter voter fraud at the polls. In 1994, Velella devoted his resources to the Pataki and Vacco campaigns, which were both successful.\n\nIn 2001, Velella endorsed former Bronx Borough President and Congressman Herman Badillo, who became a Republican in the 1990s, in the race to succeed the term-limited Mayor Giuliani. In the Republican primary, Badillo faced billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who won the endorsement of the city's four other Republican county chairmen in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. When Velella realized he was the only Republican county chairman in the city supporting Badillo, Velella stopped actively campaigning for Badillo and publicly called on him to withdraw from the race. Velella explained to the \"New York Post\" that he didn't like primaries although he enthusiastically backed Lauder in 1989 against Giuliani. Bloomberg won the primary handily. Velella then campaigned for Bloomberg, who went on to narrowly defeat Mark Green in the general election.\n\nIn late 2002, a number of Morris Park residents expressed their concerns over a (now-defunct) web site with the domain www.morrispark.com. The site reportedly contained pornographic images, racial and ethnic jokes and insults, and criticism of local businesses, community leaders and politicians, including Velella. The site's domain was registered under what was believed to be a false name, and its owner has never been identified. Velella announced that he would draft legislation that would require web site operators to register with the New York State Attorney General. Velella's action sparked the creation of a now-defunct \"Stop Guy\" Web site.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, Velella was sentenced to one year in jail for bribery under a plea deal, but was released from Rikers Island on September 28, 2004 after less than twelve weeks by the Local Conditional Release Commission, an obscure New York City agency. (Ironically, in the State Senate, Velella had voted to abolish the LCRC.) His early release sparked outrage, especially in the media. Both the \"New York Post\" and \"New York Daily News\", which both endorsed Velella in past campaigns, published editorials demanding his return to jail. The \"New York Post\" pasted Velella's face on a Monopoly \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card and published it daily in its opinion section.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg called for an investigation into the circumstances of Velella's early release. The city's Department of Investigations, which looked into the matter, found that the Local Conditional Release Commission had violated established procedures when it granted Velella's request. Mayor Bloomberg then forced the resignation of all four commission members in October and reconstituted the panel by appointing five new members, who on November 19, 2004, ordered Velella back to prison. Although Velella appealed the decision, the New York State Appeals Court refused to give him another reprieve. He returned to Rikers Island in late December to resume his sentence, and was released on March 18, 2005, after serving only 182 days of his original one-year sentence.\n\nGuy Velella received slot #94 in reporter and conservative commentator Bernard Goldberg's book, \n\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America\", citing his change in stance of crime and justice issues before and after his incarceration .\n\nVelella continued to receive an annual state pension of $75,012. In 2005, he told the \"New York Daily News\" that he did some political and business consulting. In 2007, he purchased a new home in Eastchester, a town in Westchester County, New York, but remained a resident of Morris Park.\n\nOn January 21, 2011, the New York \"Daily News\" disclosed that Velella was suffering from \"inoperable lung cancer\" and moved to Calvary Hospital for the terminally ill in the Bronx, where he died on January 27, 2011, aged 66.\n"}

It is the first major ridge in the far northeastern extension of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains, and reaches its highest elevation (the state's highest), 1,803 feet, at High Point in Montague Township. Kittatinny Mountain forms the eastern side of Wallpack Valley; the western side comprises the Wallpack Ridge (highest elevation: above sea level.\n\nMost of the range is publicly owned and protected. In the far northeast, High Point State Park protects the area around High Point itself. Further southwest, Stokes State Forest encompasses much of the range from the southern boundary of High Point State Park to the eastern boundary of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. The recreation area encompasses the entire southern half of the range, and also contains the smaller Worthington State Forest, which also protects the southwestern end of the range near the Delaware Water Gap itself.\n\nThe name comes from a Lenape Native American word meaning \"endless hill\" or \"great mountain\". The highest peak in the range is High Point at , which is also the highest point in the state of New Jersey. This peak is located in High Point state park and has a road leading to the top. The second highest mountain is Sunrise Mountain, located within Stokes State Forest. The elevation here is and has a road leading almost to the top. At the top there is a shelter with a roof but no sides.\n\nThe Kittatinny Mountain is of the Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate which is mainly composed of quartz. Due to the hardness of the quartz, the mountain is extremely resistant to weathering.\n\nAround four hundred fifty million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America. The North American plate went under the chain of islands. The islands went on top of the edge of North America creating the Highlands and the Kittatinny Valley which is the Ordovician Martinsburg Shale. Quartz and other sedimentary conglomerate was transported to the inland sea, which was over part of the Martinsburg Shale. A small continent then collided with North America around four hundred million years ago. Geologic pressure resulted, which caused compression and then folding and faulting resulted. The folding ran perpendicular to the directional forces. During folding, intense heat melted silica which cemented the quartz and other stones together. Also the intense heat allowed the rock layers to bend, thus the Kittatinny Mountain was born.\n\nNear the base of the west side of the mountain is the Silurian High Falls Formation, which is red and green shale and sandstone. The east side of the mountain near the base is of the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation which contains slate, shale and sandstone. The top of the mountain has a fairly even elevation ranging between and . There are two exceptions. One is Culver's Gap, which was created by an ancient stream which was diverted and is now a wind gap. The base of Culver's Gap is at least below the top of the mountain. Culver's Gap is located near Culver's Lake, just west of Branchville. The second is a small gap in the mountain, south of Catfish Pond, which is north of the gap. This gap is about deep.\n\nCulver's Gap was a route used by Paleo Indians and the Lenape Native Americans to go through the mountain to trade and hunt. The second is a groove or depression in the mountain ridge near Catfish Pond. This is about deep as the base of the depression is and the top of the mountain at that place is . The top of the mountain ranges from 50 meters wide to nearly wide.\n\nWest of the Kittatinny Mountain, at the northwestern end is the Port Jervis trough, also called the Minisink Valley. Next to the mountain on the western side is the Flatbrook Valley or Walpack Valley which runs from Steam Mill to Flatbrookville.\nFrom the Delaware Water Gap to the New York line is but the ridges continues into New York State where it is known as the Shawangunk Mountains. The ridge continues to nearly Kingston, New York.\n\nThe Wisconsin glacier covered the entire mountain about 21,000 BC, and melted about 13,000 BC. The terminal moraine is located near Belvidere. The glacier has left end moraines, periglacial rock fields, and kettles, at the northern end of the mountain in Stokes State Forest.\n\nThe area was a Tundra biome after the glacier melted and then became a Taiga biome as the climate warmed. At that time coniferous trees such as spruce and pine inhabited the area. The area warmed more around 8000 BC so oak, maple, birch, willow, and other deciduous trees began to grow.\n\nPaleo Indians inhabited the Delaware River Valley around 10,500 BC. after the Wisconsin Glacier melted. They hunted, fished and gathered plants to eat in the Delaware Valley and on Kittatinny Mountain. They had no permanent camps and traveled often in search of food. As the glacier melted, grasslands developed which eventually turned into coniferous and later deciduous forests after thousands of years. Big game roamed the grassland which allowed Paleo Indians to survive. Around 8000 B.C. deciduous trees began to grow, in which nut trees began to grow to allow the collection of nuts. This allowed Paleo Indian populations to increase slowly.\nThe Marshall Creek Mastodon found just north of the Gap was dated at 10,210BC ±180 years. Other big game existed at the time such as caribou and muskox.\n\nThe Lenape Native Americans that came to the area two thousand years ago from the Mississippi River valley traveled on the mountain in search of plant foods and game. They collected acorns, walnuts, hickory nuts, beech nuts, chestnuts, and butternuts from the deciduous forest and collected water from fresh streams. The Lenapes also hunted deer, elk, and bear on the mountain.\n\nThere is one waterfall on the western side of the mountain known as Buttermilk Falls. This is about south of US Route 206, in which a dirt road leads to the base of it. A wooden staircase has been built near it, so people can climb to the top.\nA second falls is seasonable during heavy rains next to Interstate 80 near the Big Cliffs. Water slides over the rocks and drops over a small ledge before going under Interstste 80.\n\nThere are several cliffs on the mountain. The largest is located at the Delaware Water Gap. The cliff is up to high and starts at Interstate 80 and extends about 400 meters along the mountain The second largest cliff is located north of the Gap, on the eastern side. Small rock faces exist on the western face and eastern face along the mountain. The southeastern face of the mountain has a steeper pitch than the northwestern face.\n\nThe top of the mountain has 14 lakes and ponds. Sunfish Pond, Catfish Pond, Mountain Ridge Lake, Blue Mountain Lake, Long Pine Pond, Lake Success, Crater Lake, Hemlock Lake, Kittatinny Lake, Steeny Kill Lake and Lake Marcia are some of them. Lake Marcia is the lake with the highest elevation on the mountain, above sea level. This lake is located in High Point State Park which is at the northern end of Kittatinny Mountain.\n\nThe mountain is a northern deciduous forest of various oaks, hickories, maples, birches, walnut, elm, ash, birch, sycamore, cherry, beech, chestnut, and sweet gum. Wild blueberries and rhodendrum also grow on the mountain.\nAnimals such as whitetailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, chipmunks, gray fox, bobcats, beaver, Mountain lion, black bears as well as a large variety of birds inhabit the mountain. Turkey Vultures and Red Tail Hawks are also common.\nFish such as trout, pickerel, and bass are also in the lakes.\n\nCopper mining began in the 1750s at the Pahaquarry Copper Mine, which is north of the Gap, off Old Mine Road. \nThis mine is located in the Silurian High Falls Formation on the west side of the mountain. This sandstone is very hard and made mining very difficult. The copper was between 2 and 3 percent in the ore which made mining unprofitable. Mining was done in the 1800s, by various companies which went bankrupt. The mine sold several times.\n\nSilver mining began in the 1880s with John Snook digging a mine at the northern end and western face of the Kittatinny mountain in an area now known as Stokes State Forest. He extracted silver ore for a short time and the silver ore was depleted. The mine is now flooded with water.\n\nTo the east of the Kittatinny Mountain, is the Great Kittatinny Valley. This is drained by the Paulinskill river in the south and the Wallkill River in the north. The Big Flatbrook drains the mountain on the northwestern end beginning at Steam mill swamp and flows in a southwesterly direction which drains into the Delaware River near Flatbrookville. This area is known as the Flatbrook Valley. \nThe Port Jervis trough is at the northwestern end of the mountain.\nThe Delaware River flows near the mountain at the south end, finally cutting across the ridge at the Delaware Water Gap just south of Mount Tammany.\n\nThe Kittatinnies are a far northeastern extension of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains. In Pennsylvania, the ridge forming the Kittatinnies becomes known as Blue Mountain and runs southwest for , nearly to Maryland. In Franklin County, Pennsylvania, however, a parallel ridge to Blue Mountain is named \"Kittatinny Mountain\"; the Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels through both ridges (a very short distance apart) with the western tunnel named \"Kittatinny Mountain\" and the eastern one \"Blue Mountain.\" To the north in New York, the ridge is known as the Shawangunk Mountains which goes to Kingston, New York.\n\n\n"}

Mozart composed the concerto in the winter of 1785–1786, finishing it on 24 March 1786, three weeks after completing his Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major. As he intended to perform the work himself, Mozart did not write out the soloist's part in full. The premiere was in early April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Chronologically, the work is the twentieth of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos.\n\nThe work is one of only two minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos features a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and timpani. The first of its three movements, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, in E major—the relative major of C minor—features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, is a theme and eight variations in C minor.\n\nThe work is one of Mozart's most advanced compositions in the concerto genre. Its early admirers included Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. Musicologist Arthur Hutchings declared it to be, taken as a whole, Mozart's greatest piano concerto.\n\nMozart composed the concerto in the winter of 1785–86, during his fourth season in Vienna. It was the third in a set of three concertos composed in quick succession, the others being No. 22 in E major and No. 23 in A major. Mozart finished composing the No. 24 shortly before the premiere of his comic opera \"The Marriage of Figaro\"; the two works are assigned adjacent numbers of 491 and 492 in the Köchel catalogue. Although composed at the same time, the two works contrast greatly: the opera is almost entirely in major keys while the concerto is one of Mozart's few minor-key works. The pianist and musicologist Robert D. Levin suggests that the concerto, along with the two concertos that precede it, may have served as an outlet for a darker aspect of Mozart's creativity at the time he was composing the comic opera. \n\nThe premiere of the concerto was on either 3 or 7 April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna; Mozart featured as the soloist and conducted the orchestra from the keyboard.\n\nIn 1800, Mozart's widow Constanze sold the original score of the work to the publisher Johann Anton André of Offenbach am Main. It passed through several private hands during the nineteenth century before Sir George Donaldson, a Scottish philanthropist, donated it to the Royal College of Music in 1894. The College still houses the manuscript today. The original score contains no tempo markings; the tempo for each movement is known only from the entries Mozart made into his catalogue. The orchestral parts in the original score are written in a clear manner. The solo part, on the other hand, is often incomplete: on many occasions in the score Mozart notated only the outer parts of passages of scales or broken chords. This suggests that Mozart improvised much of the solo part when performing the work. The score also contains late additions, including that of the second subject of the first movement's orchestral exposition. There is the occasional notation error in the score, which musicologist Friedrich Blume attributed to Mozart having \"obviously written in great haste and under internal strain\".\n\nThe concerto is divided into the following three movements:\n\nThe concerto is scored for one flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. This is the largest array of instruments for which Mozart composed any of his concertos.\n\nIt is one of only two of Mozart's piano concertos that are scored for both oboes and clarinets (the other, his concerto for two pianos, has clarinets only in the revised version). The clarinet was not at the time a conventional orchestral instrument. Robert D. Levin writes: \"The richness of wind sonority, due to the inclusion of oboes and clarinets, is the central timbral characteristic of [the concerto]: time and again in all three movements the winds push the strings completely to the side.\"\n\nThe solo instrument for the concerto is scored as a \"cembalo\". This term often denotes a harpsichord, but in this concerto, Mozart used it as a generic term that encompassed the fortepiano, an eighteenth-century version of the modern piano that among other things was more dynamically capable than the harpsichord.\n\nThe first movement is longer and more complex than any that Mozart had previously composed in the concerto genre. It is in ; among Mozart's 27 piano concertos, No. 4 in G Major, No. 11 in F major and No. 14 in E major are the only others to commence in triple metre.\n\nThe first movement follows the standard outline of a sonata form concerto movement of the Classical period. It begins with an orchestral exposition, which is followed by a solo exposition, a development section, a recapitulation, a cadenza and a coda. Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation.\n\nThe orchestral exposition, 99 measures long, presents two groups of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the tonic of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is \"piano\". The theme is tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of C minor until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly chromatic: in its 13 measures, it utilises all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.\n\n</score>\n\nThe solo exposition follows its orchestral counterpart, and it is here that convention is discarded from the outset: the piano does not enter with the principal theme. Instead, it has an 18-measure solo passage. It is only after this passage that the principal theme appears, carried by the orchestra. The piano then picks up the theme from its seventh measure. Another departure from convention is that the solo exposition does not re-state the secondary theme from the orchestral exposition. Instead, a succession of new secondary thematic material appears. Musicologist Donald Tovey considered this introduction of new material to be \"utterly subversive of the doctrine that the function of the opening tutti [the orchestral exposition] was to predict what the solo had to say.\"\n\nOne hundred measures into the solo exposition, which is now in the relative major of E, the piano plays a cadential trill, leading the orchestra from the dominant seventh to the tonic. This suggests to the listener that the solo exposition has reached an end, but Mozart instead gives the woodwinds a new theme. The exposition continues for another 60 or so measures, before another cadential trill brings about the real conclusion, prompting a ritornello that connects the exposition with the development. The pianist and musicologist Charles Rosen argues that Mozart thus created a \"double exposition\". Rosen also suggests that this explains why Mozart made substantial elongations to the orchestral exposition during the composition process; he needed a longer orchestral exposition to balance its \"double\" solo counterpart.\n\nThe development begins with the piano repeating its entry to the solo exposition, this time in the relative major of E. The Concerto No. 20 is the only other of Mozart's concertos in which the solo exposition and the development commence with the same material. In the Concerto No. 24, the material unfolds in the development in a manner different from the solo exposition: the opening solo motif, with its half cadence, is repeated four times, with one intervention from the woodwinds, as if asking question after question. The final question is asked in C minor and is answered by a descending scale from the piano that leads to an orchestral statement, in F minor, of the movement's principal theme.\n\nThe orchestral theme is then developed: the motif of the theme's fourth and fifth measures descends through the circle of fifths, accompanied by an elaborate piano figuration. After this, the development proceeds to a stormy exchange between the piano and the orchestra, which the twentieth-century Mozart scholar Cuthbert Girdlestone describes as \"one of the few [occasions] in Mozart where passion seems really unchained\", and which Tovey describes as a passage of \"fine, severe massiveness\". The exchange resolves to a passage in which the piano plays a treble line of sixteenth notes, over which the winds add echoes of the main theme. This transitional passage ultimately modulates to the home key of C minor, bringing about the start of the recapitulation with the conventional re-statement, by the orchestra, of the movement's principal theme.\n\nThe wide range of thematic material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor. The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form, contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, which has not been heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello. The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.\n\nMozart did not write down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no evidence of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.\n\nThe conventional Mozartian coda concludes with an orchestral tutti and no written-out part for the soloist. In this movement, Mozart breaks with convention: the soloist interrupts the tutti with a virtuosic passage of sixteenth notes and accompanies the orchestra through to the final \"pianissimo\" C-minor chords.\n\nAlfred Einstein said of the concerto's second movement that it \"moves in regions of the purest and most moving tranquility, and has a transcendent simplicity of expression\". Marked \"Larghetto\", the movement is in E major and cut common time. The trumpets and timpani play no part; they return for the third movement.\n\nThe movement opens with the soloist playing the four-measure principal theme alone; it is then repeated by the orchestra.\n\n</score>\n\nThis theme is, in the words of Michael Steinberg, one of \"extreme simplicity\". Donald Tovey refers to the fourth bar, extremely bare and lacking any ornamentation, as \"naive\", but considers that Mozart intended for it to be so. Mozart's first sketch of the movement was much more complex. He likely simplified the theme to provide a greater contrast with the dark intensity of the first movement. After the orchestra repeats the principal theme, there is a very simple bridge or transitional passage that Girdlestone calls \"but a sketch\" to be ornamented by the soloist, arguing that \"to play it as printed is to betray the memory of Mozart\".\n\nFollowing the bridge passage, the soloist plays the initial four-measure theme for a second time, before the orchestra commences a new section of the movement, in C minor. A brief return of the principal theme, its rhythm altered, separates the C minor section from a section in A major. After this new section, the principal theme returns to mark the end of the movement, its rhythm altered yet again. Now, the theme is played twice by the soloist, the two appearances being connected by the same simple bridge passage from the beginning of the movement. Girdlestone argues that here \"the soloist will have to draw on his imagination to adorn [the simple bridge passage] a second time\". The overall structure of the movement is thus ABACA, making the movement in rondo form.\n\nIn the middle statement of the principal theme (between the C minor and A major sections), there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.\n\nThe form of the movement is nearly identical to that of the second movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata in B major, K. 570.\n\nThe third movement features a theme in C minor followed by eight variations upon it. Hutchings considered it \"both Mozart's finest essay in variation form and also his best concerto finale.\"\n\n</score>\n\nThe tempo marking for the movement is \"Allegretto\". Rosen opines that this calls for a march-like speed and argues that the movement is \"generally taken too fast under the delusion that a quick tempo will give it a power commensurate with that of the opening movement.\" Pianist Angela Hewitt sees in the movement not a march but a \"sinister dance\".\n\nThe movement opens with the first violins stating the theme over a string and wind accompaniment. This theme consists of two eight-measure phrases, each repeated: the first phrase modulates from C minor to the dominant, G minor; the second phrase modulates back to C minor. The soloist does not play any part in the statement of the theme, entering only in Variation I. Here, the piano ornaments the theme over an austere string accompaniment.\n\nVariations II to VI are what Girdlestone and Hutchings independently describe as \"double\" variations. Within each variation, each of the eight-measure phrases from the theme is further varied upon its repeat (AABB). Variations IV and VI are in major keys. Tovey refers to the former (in A) as \"cheerful\" and the latter (in C) as \"graceful\". Between the two major-key variations, Variation V returns to C minor; Girdlestone describes this variation as \"one of the most moving\". Variation VII is half the length of the preceding variations, as it omits the repeat of each eight-measure phrase. This variation concludes with an extra three-measure passage that culminates in a dominant chord, announcing the arrival of a cadenza.\n\nAfter the cadenza, the soloist opens the eighth and final variation alone, with the orchestra joining after 19 measures. The arrival of the final variation also brings a change in metre: from cut common time to compound duple time. Both the final variation and the coda which follows contain numerous neapolitan-sixth chords. Girdlestone referred to the \"haunting\" effect of these chords and stated that the coda ultimately \"proclaims with desperation the triumph of the minor mode\".\n\nLudwig van Beethoven admired the concerto and it may have influenced his Piano Concerto No. 3, also in C minor. After hearing the work in a rehearsal, Beethoven reportedly remarked to a colleague that \"[w]e shall never be able to do anything like that.\" Johannes Brahms also admired the concerto, encouraging Clara Schumann to play it, and wrote his own cadenza for the first movement. Brahms referred to the work as a \"masterpiece of art and full of inspired ideas.\"\n\nAmong modern and twentieth-century scholars, Cuthbert Girdlestone states that the concerto \"is in all respects one of [Mozart's] greatest; we would fain say: \"the\" greatest, were it not impossible to choose between four or five of them.\" Referring to the \"dark, tragic and passionate\" nature of the concerto, Alfred Einstein states that \"it is hard to imagine the expression on the faces of the Viennese public\" when Mozart premiered the work. The musicologist Simon P. Keefe, in an exegesis of all of Mozart's piano concertos, writes that the No. 24 is \"a climactic and culminating work in Mozart's piano concerto \"oeuvre\", firmly linked to its predecessors, yet decisively transcending them at the same time.\" The verdict of the Mozart scholar Alexander Hyatt King is that the concerto is \"not only the most sublime of the whole series but also one of the greatest pianoforte concertos ever composed\". Arthur Hutchings's view is that \"whatever value we put upon any single movement from the Mozart concertos, we shall find no work greater as a concerto than this K. 491, for Mozart never wrote a work whose parts were so surely those of 'one stupendous whole'.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2297714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297714", "title": "Human Rights Party (United States)", "text": "Human Rights Party (United States)\n\nThe Human Rights Party (HRP) was a left-wing political party that existed in Michigan during the early and mid-1970s. The party achieved electoral success in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. It eventually expanded to include several other Michigan cities with large student populations. In 1975, the HRP became the Socialist Human Rights Party, and it later merged with the Socialist Party of Michigan. \nThe organization was established in 1970 under the leadership of Zolton Ferency, and it quickly gained strength following the 1971 ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which gave 18-year-olds the right to vote. In October 1971, the Radical Independent Party of Ann Arbor, Michigan (RIP), which had been formed by members of the Students for a Democratic Society, New University Conference, and International Socialists, merged with the HRP. The Human Rights Party’s platform included calls for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from foreign soil, the end of the ROTC and Selective Service, repeal of laws against homosexuality and prostitution, the closure of all state prisons, and provision of day care and health care based on ability to pay.\n\nWorking to gain electoral votes among the city's large population of students at the University of Michigan, the HRP succeeded in electing two candidates to the Ann Arbor city council in 1972, and successfully defended one of the seats in 1974. Building support through rock concerts, local radio spots, and coverage in the underground press, the HRP won 25 percent of the 30,000 ballots cast in the 1972 Ann Arbor municipal election. The party's victors in the city-council races – Jerry DeGrieck, a history student at the University of Michigan, and Nancy Wechsler, a U-M graduate, both 22 years of age – defeated two professors, both of whom were Democrats, and one of whom was an incumbent member of the City Council. As DeGrieck later noted, the party garnered substantial support not only from students, but also from low-income voters and factory workers. In two other Ann Arbor wards, reported the \"New York Times\", \"the Human Rights Party drew off enough votes from the Democratic candidates to help conservative Republicans win.\" In the next-door city of Ypsilanti, the HRP elected two city council members in 1974, both of whom were re-elected in 1976.\n\nDuring the 1972 election, the HRP chose a fifteen-year-old Sonia Yaco, an activist affiliated with Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor, as its Ann Arbor school-board candidate. Yaco's demands for a student voice in school governance earned her 1,300 votes as a write-in candidate, or eight percent of the total, and indirectly influenced the establishment of the experimental alternative Community High School later that year. One of the first HRP candidates was Lawrence (\"Larry\") Pallozola, who unsuccessfully ran for school board in Garden City, Michigan, in the early 1970s.\n\nFrom April 1972 to April 1973, the two Human Rights representatives were able to significantly influence the decisions of the Ann Arbor city council, since no political party held a majority. In addition to the HRP members, there were five Republicans and four Democrats. During their time on city council, HRP members successfully pushed for a number of progressive ordinances, including the city's famously lenient \"five-dollar pot law,\" which had the effect of decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use (see \"Cannabis laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan\"). In addition, the HRP led a push for a citywide anti-discrimination ordinance, which banned discrimination based on race, national origin, sex, age, and religion. The ordinance was the first of its kind in Michigan. In 1972, the pioneering ordinance was amended to add sexual orientation, and to require affirmative-action measures by city contractors.\n\nOn zoning issues, the party worked to restrict the construction of fast-food chains in the city's downtown area. Alongside its electoral work, the HRP put on a number of protests, supported area workers' strikes, organized city tenants, and aided the anti-war movement. As Nancy Wechsler told the \"Wall Street Journal\", the HRP also fought successfully to set aside federal revenue-sharing dollars for health and child care at a time when \"most cities are spending revenue-sharing money for more police cars.\"\n\nAt a joint press conference following a homophobic incident at a local restaurant, both of the 1972 HRP winners, Nancy Wechsler and Jerry DeGrieck, came out as gay and lesbian during their term on city council - thus simultaneously becoming the first openly lesbian and openly gay elected public officials in the United States. When Wechsler declined to run for reelection in 1974, her seat was won by HRP candidate Kathy Kozachenko. Already publicly known to be a lesbian, she thus became the first openly gay or lesbian candidate to be elected to public office in the United States.\n\nIn 1974 the HRP activists in Ypsilanti helped to pass the Ypsilanti Marijuana Initiative, a $5 fine for marijuana use or possession. In the same election, the HRP elected council members Eric Jackson and Harold Baize to their first term of office. Jackson and Baize championed anti-discrimination, fair rental practices, women's rights, and environmental issues. When Ypsilanti police ignored the voter's mandate by enforcing State marijuana laws rather than the Ypsilanti Marijuana Initiative, Jackson and Baize called for an emergency meeting of the city council to deal with the issue. Although most of the other members of the city council boycotted the meeting, hundreds of citizens did not, resulting in a near riot.\n\nHuman Rights Party city council members Eric Jackson and Harold Baize were re-elected in 1976 and continued their struggles for progressive policies. Following the loss of ballot status for the Michigan HRP, Harold Baize was elected to a third term as a Democrat in 1978. The Ypsilanti HRP changed its name to the Democratic Socialist Caucus and elected other members to the city council as well as electing Peter Murdock as mayor. At one point, the DSC controlled nine of the eleven city council seats as well as the mayor's position. It ceased to exist in 1986.\n\nWith the introduction of a strong third party in Ann Arbor, concerns grew among Democrats and HRP supporters that the city's progressive vote would be split, thus allowing Republicans to win offices on pluralities. This scenario came to pass soon after the emergence of the HRP. In 1973 Republican James E. Stephenson won the mayoral office with a plurality, defeating Democratic candidate Franz J. Mogdis and HRP candidate Benita Kaimowitz despite garnering only 47% of the vote. To head off a repeat of this result, the HRP spearheaded a petition campaign to place the Instant-runoff voting (IRV) system on the city ballot in spring of 1974. Most Democratic and HRP voters supported the proposal, which passed with 52% approval.\n\nIn April 1975, during the first (and only) Ann Arbor mayoral race using IRV, the Republican incumbent James E. Stephenson received 49% of the first-choice ballots, leading his Democratic challenger Al Wheeler, who received 40%, and the HRP candidate Carol Ernst with 11%. However, since most HRP voters had ranked Wheeler as their second choice, these votes moved to the Democrat's column, and Wheeler won the election by a slim 121 votes, becoming the city's first African American mayor. The election represented the first use of IRV in a U.S. mayoral contest.\n\nThe IRV system survived a court challenge by Republicans, but Ann Arbor voters repealed the system in an April 1976 special election. The IRV system was not again used in a United States election until San Francisco began using a similar system in 2004.\n\nWith the nationwide decline in student activism, the Human Rights Party's power waned in the mid-1970s. In 1973, Ann Arbor's Democratic/HRP governing coalition lost power, as Republican James E. Stephenson won the mayoralty and Republicans also took control of seven of the ten council seats.\n\nThe Ann Arbor chapter lost its last remaining city-council seat in 1976. In 1975, the HRP became the Socialist Human Rights Party, and it later merged with the Socialist Party of Michigan. Some members joined the Democratic Party. However, several of its landmark initiatives, notably the Ann Arbor anti-discrimination ordinance and the lenient municipal marijuana penalties, survive in modified form to this day.\n\n\n\n"}

It is known that for each\nformula_12 there are exact formula_8-covers which cannot be written as a union of two covers. For example,\n\nis an exact 2-cover which is not a union of two covers.\n\nThe first example above is an exact 1-cover (also called an \"exact cover\"). Another exact cover in common use is that of odd and even numbers, or\n\nThis is just one case of the following fact: For every positive integer modulus formula_8, there is an exact cover:\n\nThe Mirsky–Newman theorem, a special case of the Herzog–Schönheim conjecture, states that there is no disjoint distinct covering system. This result was conjectured in 1950 by Paul Erdős and proved soon thereafter by Leon Mirsky and Donald J. Newman. However, Mirsky and Newman never published their proof. The same proof was also found independently by Harold Davenport and Richard Rado.\n\nCovering systems can be used to find primefree sequences, sequences of integers satisfying the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers, such that consecutive numbers in the sequence are relatively prime but all numbers in the sequence are composite numbers. For instance, a sequence of this type found by Herbert Wilf has initial terms \nIn this sequence, the positions at which the numbers in the sequence are divisible by a prime \"p\" form an arithmetic progression; for instance, the even numbers in the sequence are the numbers \"a\" where \"i\" is congruent to 1 mod 3. The progressions divisible by different primes form a covering system, showing that every number in the sequence is divisible by at least one prime.\n\nPaul Erdős asked whether for any arbitrarily large \"N\" there exists an incongruent covering system the minimum of whose moduli is at least \"N\". It is easy to construct examples where the minimum of the moduli in such a system is 2, or 3 (Erdős gave an example where the moduli are in the set of the divisors of 120; a suitable cover is 0(3), 0(4), 0(5), 1(6), 1(8), 2(10), 11(12), 1(15), 14(20), 5(24), 8(30), 6(40), 58(60), 26(120) ) D. Swift gave an example where the minimum of the moduli is 4 (and the moduli are in the set of the divisors of 2880). S. L. G. Choi proved that it is possible to give an example for \"N\" = 20, and Pace P Nielsen demonstrates the existence of an example with \"N\" = 40, consisting of more than formula_19 congruences.\n\nErdős's question was resolved in the negative by Bob Hough. Hough used the Lovász local lemma to show that there is some maximum \"N\"<10 which can be the minimum modulus on a covering system.\n\nThere is a famous unsolved conjecture from Erdős and Selfridge: an incongruent covering system (with the minimum modulus greater than 1) whose moduli are odd, does not exist. It is known that if such a system exists with square-free moduli, the overall modulus must have at least 22 prime factors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2297825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297825", "title": "Ramming", "text": "Ramming\n\nIn warfare, ramming is a technique used in air, sea, and land combat. The term originated from battering ram, a siege weapon used to bring down fortifications by hitting it with the force of the ram's momentum, and ultimately from male sheep. Thus, in warfare, ramming refers to hitting a target by running oneself into the target.\n\nToday, hand-held battering rams are one tool among many used by law enforcement and military personnel for door breaching. Forcible entry by criminals has been implemented using such methods as vehicles rammed into buildings.\n\nThe ram was commonly used in antiquity, and was an important part of the armament of the galleys of Imperial Rome. The ancient Greeks used their trireme vessels for ramming as well. In ancient China, rams were largely unknown, as the lack of a keel and the flat shape of the junk's bow was not conducive to the build of an elongated underwater spur.\n\nThe ram's first recorded use in modern times between major warships, however, was in the American Civil War, at the Battle of Hampton Roads, when the armored Confederate warship rammed the Union frigate , sinking her almost immediately.\n\nAnother significant success of the ram in wartime was at the 1866 battle of Lissa, between Italy and Austria. The Italian ironclad \"Re d'Italia\" had been damaged aft by gunfire, and had no rudder. Lying helpless in the water, she was struck amidships by the Austrian \"Ferdinand Max\", the flagship of the Austrian Commander-in-Chief Admiral Tegetthoff. The Austrian ship retreated unharmed as the Italian vessel rolled over and sank.\n\nDuring the War of the Pacific, the Peruvian ironclad repeatedly rammed the Chilean corvette , sinking the wooden steam- and wind-powered ship.\n\nDuring World War I, rammed and sunk German submarine . This was an incidental use of the ship's bow, however. In 1918, the British troop ship HMT \"Olympic\" rammed in which the submarine sustained such heavy damage that its crew was forced to scuttle and abandon ship.\n\nIn World War II, naval ships often rammed other vessels, though this was often due to circumstances, as considerable damage could be caused to the attacking ship. The damage that lightly constructed destroyers took from the tactic led to it being officially discouraged by the Royal Navy from early 1943, after was dry-docked for three months following sinking in December 1942 and was torpedoed and sunk following damaging her propellers during the ramming of in March 1943. rammed ; and rammed .\n\nOn 29 January 1943 the Japanese submarine was rammed and wrecked by the New Zealand naval trawlers, and in shallow water at Kamimbo Bay, Guadalcanal, during Operation Ke. The submarine of 2,135 tons was much larger and more heavily armed than the minesweeping trawlers of 607 tons each.\n\nOn 5 November 1942 the rammed the Soviet submarine \"Щ 305\" in the Sea of Åland and sank it. \"Vetehinen\" was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact, \"Vetehinen\" launched a torpedo, which missed probably due being fired at too short distance. \"Vetehinen\" then opened fire with its deck guns and managed to damage the Soviet submarine, which by then had started an emergency dive. The captain of \"Vetehinen\", determined not to let the submarine escape, ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel, which at last was a success.\n\nDuring anti-submarine action, ramming was an alternative if the destroyer was too close to the surfaced submarine for her main guns to fire into the water. The tactic was used by the famous British anti-submarine specialist Captain Frederic John Walker from December 1941 to the end of the war.\n\nThe British destroyer (formerly USS \"Buchanan\", supplied under Lend-Lease) was disguised as a German destroyer for the purpose of ramming the gates of the Normandie dry dock at St. Nazaire on 28 March 1942. This was to prevent the Normandie dock ever being used by the German battleship . It was the only dock on the Nazi-occupied Atlantic coast capable of repairing such a large vessel. The operation was a success, and a large explosive time bomb charge hidden in the bow of the ship exploded the next day, putting the dock out of commission for five years.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 1943, while returning from a \"Tokyo Express\" night reinforcement mission in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese destroyer \"Amagiri\" spotted USN PT boats at a range of about 1,000 yards. Rather than open fire--and give away their position--the destroyer captain, Lieutenant Commander Kohei Hanami, turned to intercept and closed in the darkness at 30-knots. \"PT-109\" commanded by Lt. John F Kennedy was rammed and crushed by the slower less maneuverable Japanese destroyer. \n\nLt. Commander Gerard Roope, the captain of the G-class destroyer , was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for the 1940 ramming of the German cruiser following a close-range action in bad weather off the Norwegian coast. More recent claims suggest that \"Admiral Hipper\" was actually attempting to ram \"Glowworm\" and the two ships simply collided.\n\nDuring the Cod Wars between Britain and Iceland, unarmed fishing trawlers found themselves opposed by Icelandic Coastguard vessels and converted trawlers. As well as Royal Navy coastguard vessels, Britain sent large, ocean-going tugs and frigates to protect them and there were numerous ramming incidents against both sides, sometimes with very serious consequences.\n\nIn 1988, two US naval ships, destroyer and cruiser , were lightly rammed by Soviet Mirka II-class light frigate (FFL 824) and Burevestnik-class frigate \"Bezzavetny\" (FFG 811) inside contested Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, near the port of Foros. None of the ships involved suffered significant damage.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, the Venezuelan patrol boat \"Naiguatá\" rammed the cruise ship \"RCGS Resolute\" after failing to damage it with a volley of gunfire. The \"Naiguatá\" was badly damaged from striking the strengthened hull of the \"Resolute\", built to break ice, and she sank shortly afterwards.\n\nRamming in air combat is a last-ditch tactic that was used when all else had failed. The ramming pilot could use his entire aircraft as a ram or he could try to destroy the enemy's controls using the propeller or wing to chop into the enemy's tail or wing. Ramming took place when a pilot ran out of ammunition, yet was still eager to destroy an enemy, or when his plane had already been damaged beyond saving. Most ramming occurred when the attacker's aircraft was economically, strategically, or tactically less valuable than the enemy's, such as by pilots flying obsolescent aircraft against superior ones or by single-engine aircraft against multiple-engine bombers. Defenders rammed more often than invaders.\n\nA ramming attack was not considered suicidal in the same manner as \"kamikaze\" attacks—the ramming pilot stands a chance of surviving, though it was very risky. Sometimes, the ramming aircraft itself could survive to make a controlled landing, though most were lost due to combat damage or the pilot bailing out. Ramming was used in air warfare in the first half of the 20th century, in both World Wars and in the interwar period. In the jet age, as air combat speeds increased, ramming occurred much less frequently—the probability of successfully executing (and surviving) a ramming attack approached zero.\n\nIn World War II, at least one incident of a tank ramming an enemy tank has been reported. In 1944, an Irish Guards Sherman rammed a Tiger II during Operation Goodwood.\n\nThe FBI describes \"vehicle ramming attacks—using modified or unmodified vehicles—against crowds, buildings, and other vehicles.\" Such attacks are often carried out by lone-wolf terrorists. Examples of ramming attacks as acts of political terrorism include the September 11 attacks, the 2014 Jerusalem tractor attack, the 2006 UNC SUV attack, the 2008 Jerusalem bulldozer attack, and the 2008 Jerusalem vehicular attack.\n\nRam-raiding is sometimes used by criminals to breach shops to steal cash or merchandise.\n\n\n"}

Shirow's characterization of Batou in the manga, and indeed the other members of Section 9, is notably more light-hearted than the characterization used in Mamoru Oshii's films of the same name. His eyes, though prosthetic, often bulge comically when he is alarmed. He frequently jokes with Motoko, Togusa, the Tachikomas, and practically everyone else who crosses his path. His serious side becomes much more pronounced in a chapter of the manga where Yano, a trainee of Batou's, is murdered by a cybercriminal named Koil Krasnov. Batou loses his temper and impulsively calls up Section 9 Chief Aramaki, demanding an explanation for Yano's death, then storms off announcing (in the English translation), \"That… Koil is dead meat!\"\n\nBatou had seemingly hated anyone who tried to make Section 9 fix the mess of another organization, such as the AI hijacking of the Jigabachi choppers in the SAC series. However, in the \"Ghost in the Shell\" movie he appears more stoic and silent than his TV and manga counterpart. Particularly in \"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\", Batou also appears moderately distant and possibly bitter. In addition, he jokes around with a hint of irony being mentioned.\n\n\"Stand Alone Complex\" character designer Hajime Shimomura said that Batou's image was based on the Minotaur.\n\nWhile his name is officially romanized as \"Batou\", in some copies of the first film's subtitles and credits, it is spelled \"Bateau\" (the French word for \"boat\").\n\nThe name \"Batou\" means \"horse\" in Japanese and may refer to Japanese Buddhism's Batou Kannon (Horse-Headed Kannon) with his small robotic implant eyes and long face as visual references. It also means \"eight-headed\" in Mandarin Chinese, which is significant since \"Kusanagi\" was the name of a sword that was taken from Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed mountain dragon in Japanese mythology.\n\nOf all Section 9 characters, Batou is closest with the Major professionally and in civilian life. Even on missions, he is known to disregard her rank or authority to \"speak freely\" without permission.\n\nBatou originally appeared in the manga authored by Masamune Shirow, serialized in Kodansha's \"\"Young Magazine Pirate Edition\"\" from 1989 to 1991. Unlike \"S.A.C.\", where in a similar situation Batou spares the life of an ex-C.I.A. operative, Batou makes good on his threat and personally terminates Koil. His appearance and style of dress vary considerably over the series' run.\n\nIn \"Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface\", Botou's head is shaved, and he is dressed in a simple black outfit, though his sense of humor remains intact. During a psychic monitoring of the virtual contact between the main character of the manga and another entity on the net, the psychic states, \"Something of substance, something fruitful has passed between them,\" to which Batou remarks, \"A persimmon maybe?\" This prompts Chief Aramaki to issue an ultimatum: \"If you can't be serious you can leave the room.\" He also asks to link with the psychic when she suffers a similar experience to Motoko's contact with the Puppet Master, but his request is denied.\n\nThe portrayal of Batou in Mamoru Oshii's films is very different from the depiction in the anime series. \"Ghost in the Shell\" and \"\" depict a Batou who is much more subdued, even to the point of brusqueness. His appearance consists of a white crew-cut (similar to the manga) in the first film, while in the second film he has a short ponytail. Batou is voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in Japanese and Richard Epcar in English in all \"Ghost in the Shell\" media with the exception of \"The Laughing Man\" and \"Individual Eleven\" OVAs where he is voiced by David Kaye in English, and \"\", where he is voiced by Kenichirou Matsuda and Christopher Sabat respectively.\n\nBatou is the central character of \"Innocence\", which centers around his personal life after the disappearance of Major Motoko Kusanagi at the end of the first film. Oshii has commented that the investigation is really secondary to the plot. What is most notable about Batou's emotion in \"Innocence\" is his lack thereof; for the most part he expresses nothing whatsoever. The commentary on the \"Innocence\" DVD touches on the fact that it is Batou's lone companion, a Basset Hound named Gabriel, that express almost all of the emotion in the entire film. When Batou is required to leave in order to continue his investigation, Gabriel is left in the care of Togusa and his family. Ishikawa, Batou's senior, chides him for keeping such a high-maintenance dog since he is a single man in a dangerous line of work. The film strongly suggests that Batou harbors romantic feelings for the Major; however, no definitive statement of his feelings is ever made.\n\nAfter shooting his own right arm as a result of brain-hacking, Batou is fitted with a new DNA-matched prosthetic arm with a shotgun hidden inside. He is depicted as being tougher than in the other \"Ghost in the Shell\" incarnations, when he is seen to shoot two live grenades and survive the blast, and withstand a substantial leap down the shaft of the Locus Solus factory ship. In both films, Batou carries a gun dubbed a \"Jericho 942,\" based on the real Jericho 941 made by IMI but chambered for .50AE. In \"Innocence\", he is also seen with a compact S&W pistol and a small semiautomatic shotgun. The \"Innocence\" prequel novel, \"After the Long Goodbye,\" notes that Batou's S&W pistol is chambered for the .40 S&W cartridge.\n\nPilou Asbæk portrays Batou in the 2017 live action film. \"The manga is very philosophical, very weird, very spiritual,\" said Asbæk. \"So I knew that my job with Batou was to bring in a little bit of heart and soul into this futuristic sci-fi world.\" Asbæk had a hard time understanding his character until he looked back at the \"Ghost in the Shell\" source material. \"I didn’t have any idea what to do with the character and then I looked at the manga again, and I saw two things. I saw he likes beer, and he likes pizza. And if you know me for five minutes, that’s 80 percent of my personality!\" he said. The novelization of the film describes Batou as a Scandinavian.\n\nIn \"\", Batou's personality closely resembles his manga counterpart. He is depicted as an outgoing jokester, but with a quick temper. Unlike the Major, Batou often expresses his anger at injustice and cruelty quite openly. He is sometimes shown to be impatient with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa. At times, Batou acts as a voice of reason and displays great concern for the Major, and she in turn admits that she can confide in him. Like Oshii's films, the series suggests romantic tension between the Major and Batou. The film \"\" more openly addresses this tension, when Batou admits that he'd been covering up the Major's involvement in any cases prior to the Puppeteer case. The movie closes with Batou putting his arm around the Major, although whether or not this is foretelling of any relationship between the two is left ambiguous.\n\nBatou had served in a military special forces unit and often states that he was a Ranger-trained soldier with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) before entering Section 9. Despite the fact that his prosthetic body has little to gain from exercise, Batou often lifts weights and jogs. He is shown to have an affinity for martial arts and is widely regarded as nearly the best hand-to-hand combatant in Section 9, second only to the Major. He once idolized a famous boxer, Zaitsev, with whom he later spars while on an undercover mission.\n\nBatou is the favorite superior of the Tachikomas because he regularly showers them with care and affection; in episode 2.15, it also is apparent that he shares a physical resemblance with their chief programmer. He has even dubbed one unit as his \"personal\" Tachikoma, refusing to operate any other and treating it with organic oil, both habits which culminate in problems. Later in the series, the Tachikomas' AI starts to develop rapidly, which is attributed to a mutation in a protein chip caused by Batou's oil. Also, since Batou treats them as individuals as opposed to interchangeable units, they begin to view themselves as such, which contributes to the development of their AI.\n\nBatou is often seen driving a yellow Lancia Stratos coupe, a rare Italian car from the 1970s. He is shown to be very protective of the car and is hesitant to allow others to drive it. Togusa refers to Batou's love of the car as a comeback after Batou chides him for using a revolver instead of a more modern weapon. In \"Solid State Society\", Batou drives a yellow Ford GT with black racing stripes. When the Major notices the new vehicle, she comments to Batou that \"his tastes had changed.\"\n"}

Signed to Mercury Records between 1996 and 2003, he released five studio albums for the label – \"Mark Wills\", \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Permanently\", \"Loving Every Minute\", and \"And the Crowd Goes Wild\" – as well as a greatest hits package. In that same timespan, he charted sixteen singles on the \"Billboard\" country charts, all of which made the top 40. After leaving Mercury in 2003, he signed to Equity Music Group and charted three more singles. Two of these were later included on his sixth studio album, \"Familiar Stranger\", which was released on the Tenacity label in 2008.\n\nOf his albums, \"Wish You Were Here\" is the best-selling, with a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. This album's title track and the late 2002-early 2003 release \"19 Somethin'\" both reached No. 1; on the Hot Country Songs charts. Besides these, six more of his singles have reached top 10 on the chart: his debut single \"Jacob's Ladder\", \"Places I've Never Been\", \"I Do (Cherish You)\", \"Don't Laugh at Me\", \"She's in Love\", and a cover version of Brian McKnight's \"Back at One\". Two songs originally recorded by Wills, \"Somebody\" and \"What Hurts the Most\", were later hit singles for Reba McEntire and Rascal Flatts, respectively.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, Wills was invited to become the 218th member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted on January 11, 2019.\n\nWills was born in Cleveland, Tennessee. His family later moved to Blue Ridge, Georgia. \n\nIn his teenage years, Wills played in garage bands, taking inspiration from rock groups such as Bon Jovi. During his young adulthood, however, he began to take an interest in country music. He entered a local talent contest in Marietta, Georgia, at age 17, and after winning the contest, he began to perform locally. From there, he went to work as a demo singer in Atlanta, Georgia, before doing the same in Nashville, Tennessee. While in Nashville, he was discovered by record producers Carson Chamberlain and Keith Stegall, who helped him sign to a recording contract with Mercury Records Nashville.\n\nWills's self-titled debut album was released in 1996 under the production of Carson Chamberlain and Keith Stegall. Its lead-off single, \"Jacob's Ladder\", went to number 6 on the country charts. \"High Low and in Between,\" the B-side to \"Jacob's Ladder,\" was the next single, reaching number 33. Finishing off the single releases was the number five \"Places I've Never Been.\" Despite the success of its first and third singles, the album did not sell well, and it peaked at No. 38 on the country albums charts.\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\" was Wills's second album. This was his most commercially successful, earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The lead-off single \"I Do (Cherish You)\" and its followup, \"Don't Laugh at Me\", both reached No. 2 on the country charts, with the former bringing him to the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the first time. Following the pair of No. 2-peaking songs was the album's title track. Co-written by Bill Anderson, Skip Ewing, and Debbie Moore, it became Wills's first No. 1 country hit in 1999. Later that year, the boy band 98 Degrees covered \"I Do (Cherish You)\" on their album \"98 Degrees and Rising\". Following \"Wish You Were Here\" was \"She's in Love\", the final single from \"Wish You Were Here\", which peaked at No. 7. In 1998, Wills received an Academy of Country Music award for Top New Male Vocalist.\n\nIn 2000 he voiced the character of Huckleberry Finn in MGM's animated remake of Tom Sawyer. Also for the film, Wills and Lee Ann Womack, who plays the singing voice of Becky in the film, as a duet sing the end title song \"Never Ever and Forever\".\n\nWills's eighth chart entry was a cover of R&B singer Brian McKnight's 1998 hit single \"Back at One\". This cover was a top 5 country hit for Wills in early 2000 and the first single from his third album, \"Permanently\". This album was Wills's highest entry on the country albums charts, peaking at No. 3 there. Following \"Back at One\" was another R&B cover, this time of Brandy's 1999 single \"Almost Doesn't Count\". This cover reached Top 20, and was followed by \"I Want to Know (Everything There Is to Know About You)\", which reached No. 33. \"Permanently\" was ceritifed gold by the RIAA. Unlike his previous albums, this album was produced entirely by Carson Chamberlain, as Stegall had exited Mercury in 2000.\n\n\"Loving Every Minute\" was the title of Wills's fourth studio album and its lead-off single. This song, co-written by Michael White, only peaked at No. 18, however, and the album's other single – the Jamie O'Neal duet \"I'm Not Gonna Do Anything Without You\", which was also on O'Neal's debut album \"Shiver\" – reached No. 31. Also included on this album was the song \"Somebody\", which later became a Number One hit in 2004 when Reba McEntire recorded it for her 2003 album \"Room to Breathe\".\n\nWills's biggest chart hit, \"19 Somethin'\", was released in late 2002. It topped the country charts in early 2003, and stayed at Number One for six weeks. The song was also his highest Hot 100 entry, peaking at No. 23. This song was the first of two newly recorded songs on his 2003 greatest hits album, which reprised all of his chart singles to that point except \"High Low and in Between\" and \"I Want to Know (Everything There Is to Know About You)\". The other new song on this album, \"When You Think of Me\", was a No. 28 country hit in early 2003. Wills produced these two new tracks with Chris Lindsey.\n\n\"And the Crowd Goes Wild\", his fifth studio album, came later in 2003. This was his first full studio album which he co-produced, again doing so with Chris Lindsey. Although the album itself peaked at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums chart, its two singles only made the middle and lower top 40 regions on the Hot Country Songs chart. Its Jeffrey Steele-penned country rock and country rap-generated title track was the lead-off single, reaching No. 29 on the country charts. Following it was \"That's a Woman\", which stopped at No. 40. Like his previous studio release, this album included a song that would later become a number-one hit for another artist: \"What Hurts the Most\", which was a number-one country and adult contemporary hit for the group Rascal Flatts when they covered it on their 2006 album \"Me and My Gang\". This song was also a single for Jo O'Meara in 2005 and Cascada in 2007. Wills's own rendition was a minor hit on the Hot Digital Songs charts in 2006. Also included on \"And the Crowd Goes Wild\" was a cover of Ronnie Milsap's hit \"Prisoner of the Highway\", recorded as a duet with Milsap.\n\nDue to the poor performance of \"And the Crowd Goes Wild\", Wills exited Mercury in 2004. In 2004, Wills also recorded a cover of Elvin Bishop's \"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\" for the southern rock tribute album \"Southern Rock Country Style\". He did not record again until country singer Clint Black signed him to his Equity Music Group label in 2006. Wills's first release for the label was \"Hank\", which peaked at No. 49 and was never included on an album. His first album for the label, titled \"Familiar Stranger\", was originally slated for release in September 2007, and was repeatedly pushed back due to the poor chart performance of \"Take It All Out on Me\" and \"Days of Thunder.\" Tenacity Records then acquired the album and released it in 2008, issuing \"The Things We Forget\" as its third single. After this song came \"Entertaining Angels\", co-written by Willie Mack. In late 2009, he released then a fifth single, \"Crazy White Boy,\" written by Brett James and Blair Daly. Wills released the compilation album \"2nd Time Around\" in July 2009, which comprises re-recordings of several Mercury singles.\n\nWills released a new single in January 2011 called \"Looking for America\", written by Bernie Nelson, Philip Douglas and Jeremy Bussey. It served as the title track to his 2011 album of the same name, released June 21, 2011, from Big Red Records and Tenacity Records.\n\nHe was invited by Vince Gill to become the 218th member of the Grand Ole Opry on December 21, 2018, and was inducted on January 11, 2019\n\nIn 1996, Wills married his wife, Kelly, whom he met at Atlanta's music club, Buckboard. They have two daughters.\n\nIn November 2010, Wills was hospitalized for surgery after his large intestine ruptured. He was told that had he waited any longer to seek medical help, he would have died.\n\n"}

His doctoral thesis concerned the measurement of anaerobic threshold in the sport of running.\n\nFerrari was a consultant to the Italian Track and Field Federation (FIDAL) from 1977 to 1980. He became a specialist in sports medicine at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1981.\nHe was co-author of more than 20 papers in journals of sports physiology. He studied parameters of athletes in a variety of sports, such as track and field, cycling, swimming, skiing, and speed-skating. Subsequently, until 1983, he was the sports physician of the National Italian Biathlon team (FISI).\n\nEventually he settled on his lifelong interest in the development of training programmes for professional cyclists. One of Ferrari's earliest successes was coaching Francesco Moser to achieve the hour record in 1984, crushing Eddy Merckx's mark by more than a mile.\n\nInitially Ferrari worked with Professor Francesco Conconi at the University of Ferrara, who developed testing techniques for human performance, using methods such as monitoring the heart rate during exercise and recovery. Another controversial Italian doctor, Luigi Cecchini, is their common disciple. They have shared the care for some cyclists throughout their careers.\n\nFrom 1984 onwards, Ferrari achieved extraordinary improvements in the fitness of many cyclists. Ferrari popularised the use of VAM, a parameter now used in cycling as a measure of fitness and speed.\n\nIn 1994, Ferrari was the team doctor for Gewiss. The team had an excellent season, winning many races. In the Flèche Wallonne, the team realized a historic triple victory. Concerned by the domination of the Italian team, some observers pointed a finger of suspicion at the team doctor. Far from calming this controversy, Ferrari compared erythropoietin to orange juice. \"EPO is not dangerous, it's the abuse that is. It's also dangerous to drink 10 liters of orange juice\". This statement cost him his job as team physician. But his reputation was made, and his name thereafter was associated with use of EPO in particular. In 1995, Ferrari started his own private medical practice.\n\nProfessional bicycle racers who were clients, in some capacity, of Ferrari include: Lance Armstrong, Michael Rogers, Alexander Vinokourov, Michele Scarponi, Denis Menchov, Giovanni Visconti, Yaroslav Popovych, Alessandro Bertolini, Gianluca Bortolami, Gianni Bugno, Mario Cipollini, Claudio Chiappucci, Roman Kreuziger, Armand de Las Cuevas, Fernando Escartín, Gianni Faresin, Giorgio Furlan, Ivan Gotti, Andreas Kappes, Kevin Livingston, Eddy Mazzoleni, Axel Merckx, Thomas Dekker, Abraham Olano, Daniele Pontoni, Tony Rominger, Paolo Savoldelli, Filippo Simeoni, Pavel Tonkov, Enrico Zaina and Beat Zberg.\n\nPerhaps the most famous athlete to have been coached or advised by Ferrari is Lance Armstrong. Ferrari claims they were introduced to each other by Eddy Merckx in 1995. Earlier that year, Armstrong had begun doping. Ferrari was involved with the US Postal Service Cycling Team until October 2004, helping Armstrong train during several of his seven consecutive Tour de France victories. Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's teammate who later confessed to doping, worked with Ferrari for one year, according to his own account in a television interview.\n\nIn October 2004, Ferrari was sentenced to one-year prison (suspended) and a fine of 900 euros, for sporting fraud and abusive exercise of the profession of pharmacist. \nFerrari's conviction in Italian court was based partly on testimony from Italian bicycle racer Filippo Simeoni. Admitting he had been doped since 1993, Simeoni told how he became affiliated with Ferrari in 1996. Simeoni testified that, in addition to a prescription of EPO hormone, \"we spoke about Andriol (testosterone), which I was to use after hard training sessions, with the aim of increasing my muscular power. Dr. Ferrari recommended I use Emagel the morning before controls, and another product to decrease my hematocrit.\" Ferrari argued, in his defense: \"Andriol is easily detectable for several days in a normal urine test, so, it is impossible that I suggested he take one Andriol 20 hours before another race.\"\n\nLance Armstrong responded to Ferrari's guilty verdict for malpractice in the Italian Court case:\n\nFerrari then announced his intention to appeal his sentence. Ferrari was acquitted of all charges against him on May 27, 2006, because, according to the court, \"the facts do not exist\" to support the charges.\n\nOn 13 June 2012, Ferrari was officially charged by USADA with administration and trafficking of prohibited substances. As Ferrari did not formally contest this indictment, he was issued a lifetime ban from professional sport in July 2012. In December 2012, Ferrari still protested his innocence in an interview with Al Jazeera. He notably stated about Lance Armstrong in that interview: “So, either he was clean – and in my opinion, he was clean and he says he was clean – or the tests are not powerful,” Ferrari added, before laughing: “Or the UCI was corrupt.” In January 2013, after Lance Armstrong had confessed to using PEDs, Ferrari claimed on his blog that the cyclist could have achieved similar blood values and performance with altitude training.\n\nIn November 2013, Armstrong settled a lawsuit with Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC). AIC had sought to recover $3 million it had paid Armstrong as bonuses for winning the Tour de France from 1999–2001. The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum one day before Armstrong was scheduled to give a deposition under oath. In written testimony for the suit, Armstrong admitted under oath that Ferrari had been one of four individuals who had supplied him with PEDs during his cycling career.\n\n\n"}

A Roman Senator during the waning days of the Roman Republic, Decius solves mysteries, while at the same time working his way steadily up the \"cursus honorum\".\n\nThe \"SPQR\" series takes the form of Decius's memoirs, written during the reign of Augustus Caesar, when he has outlived all his friends and enemies, and no longer cares whom he offends or what anyone might do to him.\n\nBorn in 95 BC into the prominent Caecilii Metelli family, a (fictional) nephew of Metellus Pius, Decius began his career serving as a military legate and scout commander, in the civil war against Quintus Sertorius, during which he receives a scar from an Iberian spear.\n\nHe holds several political and judicial offices in the turbulent days leading up to the Roman Civil War. He becomes an ally of Cicero, a reluctant ally of Cato the Younger, a close friend of Titus Annius Milo, and a mortal enemy of Publius Clodius Pulcher. He later marries Julia, the (fictional) niece of Julius Caesar (by a lucky accident, the political marriage desired by his family coincides with his and Julia's own wishes).\n\nImmediately before the Civil War, he is touring southern Italy as praetor peregrinus (a sort of roving magistrate who adjudicates cases related to resident non-citizens).\n\nThe volume most recently published in English, \"The Year of Confusion\", takes place the year before Caesar's assassination, while Caesar is exercising his dictatorship in Rome. Decius is the sole surviving member of his family (or at least the only member still in the Senate), since his family connection with Caesar has separated him from the rest of his family, who have been disgraced and destroyed for their support of Pompey. Decius's activities between the previous novel, \"Oracle of the Dead\" and the events of \"Confusion\" are not detailed in the novels (except for a reference at the end of the fourth, \"The Temple of the Muses\", that he was in Egypt with Caesar during his famous mediation between Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra).\n\nBy the time of his memoirs' writing, he is an elderly senator during the reign of Augustus, whom he despises so much that he refuses to refer to him except as \"The First Citizen,\" one of his more innocuous titles. Augustus leaves Decius alone, knowing him to be powerless, and even occasionally calls on him to solve a mystery (the subject matter of some of the short stories).\n\nIt is confirmed in \"Oracle\" that Julia, his wife, has predeceased him. Their inability to conceive a child is a source of tension in their marriage during the novels, but, according to one of the short stories, he has at least one grandson, indicating that he and Julia had at least one child before she died.\n\nAfter Decius solves the murder of Julia the Elder's lover in 22 BC, clearing Julia of all suspicion, Augustus offers him the position of Rex Sacrorum. Decius declines, declaring that he views exile on an unknown island as being preferable. His exploits after that are unknown.\n\n"}

It was developed in 1943 by Hans Mueller. In this technique, the effect of a particular optical element is represented by a Mueller matrix—a 4×4 matrix that is an overlapping generalization of the Jones matrix.\n\nDisregarding coherent wave superposition, any fully polarized, partially polarized, or unpolarized state of light can be represented by a Stokes vector ; and any optical element can be represented by a Mueller matrix (M).\n\nIf a beam of light is initially in the state formula_1 and then passes through an optical element M and comes out in a state formula_2, then it is written\n\nIf a beam of light passes through optical element M followed by M then M it is written\n\ngiven that matrix multiplication is associative it can be written\n\nMatrix multiplication is not commutative, so in general\n\nWith disregard for coherence, light which is unpolarized or partially polarized must be treated using the Mueller calculus, while fully polarized light can be treated with either the Mueller calculus or the simpler Jones calculus. Many problems involving coherent light (such as from a laser) must be treated with Jones calculus, however, because it works directly with the electric field of the light rather than with its intensity or power, and thereby retains information about the phase of the waves.\n\nMore specifically, the following can be said about Mueller matrices and Jones matrices:\nStokes vectors and Mueller matrices operate on intensities and their differences, i.e. incoherent superpositions of light; they are not adequate to describe either interference or diffraction effects.\n\nAny Jones matrix [J] can be transformed into the corresponding Mueller–Jones matrix, M, using the following relation:\nwhere * indicates the complex conjugate <nowiki>[</nowiki>sic<nowiki>]</nowiki>, [\"A\" is:]\n\nand ⊗ is the tensor (Kronecker) product.\n\nWhile the Jones matrix has eight independent parameters [two Cartesian or polar components for each of the four complex values in the 2-by-2 matrix], the absolute phase information is lost in the [equation above], leading to only seven independent matrix elements for a Mueller matrix derived from a Jones matrix.\n\nBelow are listed the Mueller matrices for some ideal common optical elements:\n\nGeneral expression for reference frame rotation from the local frame to the laboratory frame:\n\nwhere formula_10 is the angle of rotation. For rotation from the laboratory frame to the local frame, the sign of the sine terms inverts.\n\n\nThe Mueller matrices for other polarizer rotation angles can be generated by reference frame rotation.\n\nThe Mueller/Stokes architecture can also be used to describe non-linear optical processes, such as multi-photon excited fluorescence and second harmonic generation. The Mueller tensor can be connected back to the laboratory-frame Jones tensor by direct analogy with Mueller and Jones matrices.\n\nwhere formula_23 is the rank three Mueller tensor describing the Stokes vector produced by a pair of incident Stokes vectors, and formula_24 is the 2×2×2 laboratory-frame Jones tensor.\n\n\n"}

He was instrumental in the post-war capture of former Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann and also played an essential role in starting the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials.\n\nBauer was born in Stuttgart, to Jewish parents, Ella (Hirsch) and Ludwig Bauer. He attended Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium and studied business and law at the Universities of Heidelberg, Munich and Tübingen.\n\nIn 1928, after receiving his Phd in law (at 25, the youngest \"Doktor der Rechte\" [Jur.Dr.] in Germany), Bauer became an assessor judge in the Stuttgart local district court. By 1920, he already had joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). In the early 1930s, Bauer was, together with Kurt Schumacher, one of the leaders of the SPD's Reichsbanner defense league in Stuttgart. In May 1933, soon after the Nazi seizure of power, a plan to organize a general strike against the Nazis in the Stuttgart region failed, and Schumacher and Bauer were arrested with others and taken to Heuberg concentration camp. The more prominent and older Schumacher, who had been an outspoken opponent of the Nazis as an SPD deputy in the Reichstag, remained in concentration camps (which destroyed his health) until the end of World War II, whereas the young and largely unknown Bauer was released. A short time later Bauer, like most Jews, was dismissed from his civil service position. \n\nIn 1935, Bauer emigrated to Denmark, then in 1943 to Sweden after the Danish government resigned and the Nazis declared martial law which endangered the Jewish population in Denmark. The fact that Bauer was a homosexual – a fact that he was careful to keep to himself – placed him in even further peril should he remain in Germany or in Nazi-occupied Denmark. In Sweden Bauer founded, along with Willy Brandt, the periodical \"Sozialistische Tribüne\" (). Bauer returned to Germany in 1949, as the postwar Federal Republic (West Germany) was being established, and once more entered the civil service in the justice system. At first he became director of the district courts, and later the equivalent of a U.S. district attorney, in Braunschweig. In 1956, he was appointed the district attorney in Hessen, based in Frankfurt a. M. Bauer held this position until his death in 1968.\n\nIn 1957, Bauer relayed information about the whereabouts in Argentina of fugitive Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann to Israeli Intelligence (the Mossad) that allowed Eichmann to be captured. Bauer thus was instrumental in bringing him to trial in Israel in 1960. Bauer also was active in the postwar efforts to obtain justice and compensation for victims of the Nazi regime. In 1958, he succeeded in getting a class action lawsuit certified, consolidating numerous individual claims in the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, which opened in 1963. \n\nIn 1968, working with German journalist Gerhard Szczesny, Bauer founded the Humanist Union, a human-rights organization. After Bauer's death, the Union donated money to endow the Fritz Bauer Prize. Another organization, the Fritz Bauer Institute, founded in 1995, is a nonprofit organization dedicated to civil rights that focuses on history and the effects of the Holocaust.\n\nFritz Bauer's work contributed to the creation of an independent, democratic justice system in West Germany, as well as to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals and the reform of the criminal law and penal systems.\n\nWithin the postwar German justice system, Bauer was a controversial figure due to his political engagements. He once said, \"In the justice system, I live as in exile.\"\n\nBauer died in Frankfurt am Main, aged 64. He was found drowned in his bathtub. A post mortem examination found that he had taken alcohol and sleeping tablets.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2297943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297943", "title": "Pushkar Lake", "text": "Pushkar Lake\n\nPushkar Lake or Pushkar Sarovar is located in the town of Pushkar in Ajmer district of the Rajasthan state of western India. Pushkar Lake is a sacred lake of the Hindus. The Hindu scriptures describe it as \"Tirtha-Guru\" – the perceptor of pilgrimage sites related to a water-body and relate it to the mythology of the creator-god Brahma, whose most prominent temple stands in Pushkar. The Pushkar Lake finds mention on coins as early as the 4th century BC.\n\nPushkar Lake is surrounded by 52 bathing ghats (a series of steps leading to the lake), where pilgrims throng in large numbers to take a sacred bath, especially around Kartik Poornima (October–November) when the Pushkar Fair is held. A dip in the sacred lake is believed to cleanse sins and cure skin diseases. Over 500 Hindu temples are situated around the lake precincts.\n\nTourism and deforestation in the surroundings have taken a heavy toll on the lake, adversely affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population. As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme.\n\nPushkar Lake around which the Pushkar town has developed is in the Ajmer district in the state of Rajasthan, India amidst the Aravalli range of hills. The mountain range known as \"Nag Parbat\" (\"snake mountain\") separates the lake from the city of Ajmer. The valley is formed between the two parallel ranges of the Aravalli hills (in elevation range of running south-west to north-east. Situated at northwest from Ajmer, the artificial Pushkar Lake created by building a dam is surrounded by deserts and hills on all three sides. The lake is categorized as a \"Sacred Lake\" under the list of \"Classification of Lakes in India\".\n\nThe soil and topography in the catchment are predominantly sandy with very low water retention capacity. The land use pattern in the Pushkar valley that drains into the lake comprises 30% of the area under shifting sand dunes, 30% under hills (degraded and barren) and streams and 40% of the area is agricultural.\n\nThe region experiences semi-arid climatic conditions with dry and hot summers and cool winters. The summer months of May and June are the hottest, with a maximum temperature of around . During the winter months, the maximum mean temperature is in the range of . Rain mainly occurs during a short spell of two months during July and August. The recorded average rainfall is in the range of . Rainfall is also recorded some times during winter months of January and February.\n\nFrom April to September, strong winds blowing in the southwest to northeast direction add to the formation of sand dunes.\n\nThe Pushkar Lake drains a catchment of the Aravalli hills covering an area of . The lake has a water surface area of . It is a perennial lake sourced by the monsoon rainfall over the catchment. The depth of water in the lake varies from season to season from . The total storage capacity of the lake is 0.79 million cubic metres (1.03 million cu yd). As the lake periphery is encircled by 52 ghats of various sizes, the surface water flow from the catchment into the lake is channeled through a series of arches under a footbridge, long at the southern end. The footbridge facilitates the \"parikrama\" (circumambulation) that is performed by pilgrims around the lake covering all the 52 ghats (covers an area of ).\n\nPushkar Lake, when full, is rich in fish and other aquatic life. The depth of the lake has substantially shrunk – to less than from a maximum of – resulting in the death of large fish weighing , caused due to the viscous water and the lack of oxygen for the fish to survive. Since the region where the lake and its valley is situated is arid, the flora and fauna recorded relate to desert plants, including cactus and thorny bushes, as well as desert animals like camels and cattle. Man-eating crocodiles used to be a menace in the Puskhar Lake, resulting in the deaths of people. Pilgrims were aware of this fact, yet many considered it as lucky to be eaten by crocodiles. The crocodiles were caught with nets by the British and shifted to a nearby reservoir.\n\nPushkar Lake's history dates back to the 4th century BC. Numismatics, in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time. The inscriptions found at Sanchi attest to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even if it did not lie on the trade route.\n\nIn the fifth century AD, Chinese traveller Fa Xian made reference to the number of visitors to Pushkar Lake.\n\nA story tells of a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lakeshore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into the lake and was astonished to see that the Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.\n\nThe creation of Pushkar Lake, as an artificial lake, is also credited to the 12th century when a dam was built across the headwaters of the Luni River. The 10th Sikh guru, Guru Govind Singh (1666–1708), is said to have recited the Sikh sacred text \"Guru Granth Sahib\" on the banks of the lake.\n\nDuring the Mughal rule, there was a short break in the lake's importance due to the levy of a pilgrim tax and a ban on religious processions. In 1615–16, the Mughal emperor Jahangir (1569–1627) built his hunting lodge (seen now in total ruins) on the shores of the Pushkar Lake to celebrate his victory over the local Rajput Rana (king). He came to this lodge 16 times for hunting during his stay in Ajmer, about from Pushkar. This act violated the local tradition of not killing any animals in the precincts of the sacred lake. He also committed an idolatrous act by breaking the image of Varaha – the boar Avatar of the god Vishnu, as it resembled a pig and symbolically hurt Islamic sensitivity. Thereafter, Jahangir's grandson emperor Aurangzeb (1618–1707) destroyed and desecrated several temples, which were later rebuilt. However, during the rule of Jahangir's father, Emperor Akbar (1542–1605), there was a revival of not only the lake but also the Ajmer's Dargah dedicated to sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti, of whom Akbar was a devout follower.\n\nThe Rajput rulers of Amber, Bundi, Bikaner and Jaisalmer made great efforts to restore the importance of the lake and its surrounding temples. Credits given for modern additions to the building of ghats and the renovation/construction of temples go to Maharaja Man Singh I of Amber for the Raj Ghat and Man temple; Maha Rana Pratap for the Varaha temple; Daulat Rao Scindia for Kot Tirth Ghat, the Marathas-Anaji Scindia to the Koteshwar Mahadev temple and Govind Rao, the Maratha governor of Ajmer for Shiva Ghat; to the British rule for combining the religious pilgrimage with a cattle fair to generate taxes for improving the lake and its surroundings; and gifting of the Jaipur Ghat and the Main Palace on the ghat in 1956 by the Maharaja of Jaipur.\n\nThere are various legends from Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata and the Puranic scriptures which mention the Pushkar Lake and the town of Pushkar surrounding it.\nAccording to the Hindu scripture \"Padma Purana\", Brahma saw the demon Vajranabha (Vajranash in another version) trying to kill his children and harassing people. He immediately slew the demon with his weapon, the lotus-flower. In this process, the lotus petals fell on the ground at three places, where springs emerged creating three lakes: the Pushkar Lake or Jyeshta Pushkar (greatest or first Pushkar), the Madya Pushkar (middle Pushkar) Lake, and Kanishta Pushkar (lowest or youngest Pushkar) lake. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the flower (\"pushpa\") fell from Brahma's hand (\"kar\") as \"Pushkar\". It is also said that the sacred Sarasvati River emerged at Pushkar as five streams. The three lakes were assigned their presiding deities as the Hindu Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, respectively. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the lotus fell as 'Pushkar'. Brahma then decided to perform a yagna at the place, at the main Pushkar Lake. However, his wife Savitri (called Sarasvati in some versions) could not be present at the designated time to perform the essential part of the yagna. Brahma, therefore, married a Gujjar,a dominant agricultural race named Gayatri and completed the yagna with his new consort sitting beside him. However, when Savitri finally arrived at the venue, she found Gayatri sitting next to Brahma in her rightful place. Agitated, she cursed Brahma that he would be worshipped only in Pushkar. As a result of this, yagna performed in the presence of all the gods, it is said that a dip in the lake created at this place is credited with holiness, assuring salvation from all sins. It is now one of the five holiest centres of pilgrimage for Hindus.\n\nRamayana and Mahabharata refer to Pushkar Lake as \"Adi Tirtha\", or the \"original sacred water-body\". The famous Sanskrit poet and play-writer Kalidasa also referred to this lake in his poem Abhijñānaśākuntalam. The Ramayana mentions that Vishwamitra performed penance at Pushkar Lake for a thousand years. In spite of Brahma appearing before him and granting him the higher status of a rishi instead of a royal-sage (\"rajarishi\"), Vishwamitra continued his penance, but, the celestial nymph apsara, Menaka came to the lake to take a bath. Vishwamitra was enamoured by her beauty and they decided to live together in pursuit of pleasure for ten years. Then, Vishwamitra realized that his main activity of penance was disturbed. He, therefore, took leave of Menaka and went away to the north to continue his meditation. Vishwamitra was also described as building the Brahma temple at Pushkar after Brahma's yagna. Mahabharata mentions that Pushkar is a holy place of the god Vishnu, considered as the Adi Tirtha where millions of tirthas united during sunrise and sunset, and visiting the lake and taking a holy bath in the lake would wash off all sins.\n\nAccording to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes collectively called \"Panch-Sarovar\" ('Sarovar' means \"lake\"). Namely, Mansarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar; hence, Pushkar is considered one of the most sacred places in India. It is also the belief of devotees that a dip in the waters of the lake on Kartik Poornima would equal the benefits that would accrue by performing yagnas (fire-sacrifices) for several centuries. Pushkar is often called \"Tirtha-Raj\" – the king of pilgrimage sites related to water-bodies. The scriptures also mention that doing parikrama (circumambulation) of the three lakes (the main Pushkar, Madya Pushkar where there is a Hanuman temple and an old Banyan tree, and Kanistha Pushkar where a Krishna temple exists), which cover a distance of , during the Kartik Poornima day would be highly auspicious. \"International Business Times\" has identified Pushkar as one of the ten most religious places in the world and one of the five sacred pilgrimage places for the Hindus, in India.\n\nPushkar Lake and its precincts offer a plethora of monuments of national importance, such as the Pushkar city, the Brahma temple at Pushkar and the ghats on the periphery of the lakes. The lake is the central divine theme for the popularity of all the monuments seen in the town and the fairs held here.\n\nPushkar city, with a population of 14,791 at the 2001 census, is one of the oldest cities in India. The city lies on the shore of Pushkar Lake. The date of its actual origin is not known, but legend associates Brahma with its creation concurrent with the lake; Brahma is said to have performed penance here for a \"darshan\" (sight) of god Vishnu. Thus, its uniqueness lies in the fact of its historic-religious-cultural background, and as a result it attracts approximately 100,000 visitors every month, apart from the very large congregation that occurs during the annual Pushkar Fair. However, Pushkar Lake is central to its sustenance as a religious centre. The tourist arrivals during 2005 were reported to be about 16.12 million (said to be the maximum among all tourist attractions in Rajasthan), out of which the foreign tourists were about 63,000.\n\nApart from the sacred Lake, Pushkar is said to have over 500 temples (80 are large and the rest are small); of these many old temples were destroyed or desecrated by Muslim depredations during Aurangzeb's rule (1658–1707) but were re-built subsequently. The most important of these is the Brahma temple. Though the current structure dates to the 14th century, the original temple is believed to be 2000 years old. Pushkar is often described in the scriptures as the only Brahma temple in the world, owing to the curse of Savitri, but also as the \"King of the sacred places of the Hindus\". Although now the Pushkar temple does not remain the only Brahma temple, it is still one of very few existing temples dedicated to Brahma in India as well as the most prominent. Hindu pilgrims, including holy men and sages visit this temple after taking a ceremonial sacred bath in the Pushkar Lake. Other notable temples around the lake include Varaha temple – dedicated to Varaha (the boar incarnation of god Vishnu), Savitri temple and Gayatri temple, dedicated to the consorts of Brahma.\n\nGhats (stone steps laid on a gradual bank slope to descend to the lake edge) at Pushkar are integral to the lake. Ghats are also used for sacred bathing and rites, such as ancestor worship. Out of 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy bath in the lake, ten important ghats on the periphery of the lake, which have other contiguous ghats adjoining them, have also been declared as 'Monuments of National Importance'. These ghats are: the Varaha Ghat, the Dadhich Ghat, Saptarishi Ghats, Gwalior Ghat, Kota Ghat, Gau ghat, Yag Ghat, Jaipur Ghat, Karni Ghat and Gangaur Ghat. These ghats, as well as the sacred Pushkar Lake (which is also a declared heritage monument), have been refurbished over the centuries by the Royal families of Rajasthan and by the Maratha kings. These are now undergoing further works as part of a heritage improvement programme launched with funds provided by the Government of Rajasthan and several departments of the Government of India. There are strict codes to be followed while taking a bath in the ghats, such as removing shoes away from the ghats and avoiding the passing of unwarranted comments about Hindu religious beliefs by non-Hindus, since the ghats and the temples are linked to the divine lake. The sacred water of the lake is said to be curative of many skin diseases. Local belief is that water around each ghat has a special curative power. While many ghats have been named after the Rajas who built them, some ghats have particular importance. Varaha ghat is so named since Vishnu appeared here in his incarnation of a boar (\"Varaha\"). Brahma Ghat is so named since Brahma bathed here. The Gau Ghat was renamed as Gandhi Ghat after Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed at this ghat. Nart Singh Ghat, close to Varaha Ghat, has a stuffed crocodile on display.\n\nA coinage known as \"Puskar Passport\" used by visitors to the lake and the ghats denotes the red thread that is tied on the wrists of pilgrims by the priests (for a dakshina – an unspecified fee). This indicates that the pilgrim has visited Pushkar Lake and is usually not approached by priests again for further rites and fees.\n\nPushkar Lake and its precincts become very heavily populated during the annual Pushkar Fair or \"Pushkar mela\", which has both a religious as well as an economic aspect. During the fair, a very large gathering of pilgrims takes a holy dip in the lake and the camel fair is an adjunct celebration. Pushkar Fair commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi, the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight and ends on Kartik Poornima – the full Moon day in the month of Kartik (October–November), the latter being the most important day of the fair. This fair is held in the honour of god Brahma. A ritual bath on Kartik Poornima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one to salvation. It is believed circling the three Pushkars on Kartik Poornima is highly meritorious. Sadhus, Hindu holy men, gather here and stay from the Ekadashi to full moon day in caves. The Pushkar fair is also Asia's largest camel fair. The colourful and lively Camel Fair reportedly attracts 2 lakh people and 50,000 camels. In this fair held on the banks of the lake, camels are very colourfully decorated and paraded in the sand dunes on the southern part of the lake. Tribes from several neighbouring villages are seen in their traditional colourful costumes. The fair on Kartik Poornima, the day when Brahma is believed to have concluded his Yagna establishing the lake. It is organized by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), Pushkar Municipal Board and the Animal Husbandry Department of Rajasthan. The fair is a colourful cultural event also with folk dances, music, camel races, and the cattle fair. The tug of war is a popular entertaining sport held during the fair. This event is held between the Rajasthanis and foreigners; locals invariably win the event.\n\nThe natural environment of Pushkar Lake and its precincts has become increasingly degraded in the last few decades. The problems arise primarily from the over development of tourist facilities as well as the deforestation of the surrounding area.\n\nThe critical issues related to the conservation of the lake have been identified as:\n\n\nIn recent years, storage in the Pushkar Lake has been reduced alarmingly, leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the situation became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks near one of the upper ghats, fed by tube wells from groundwater sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake.\n\nThe lake does not meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high concentration of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.\n\nTo supplement water supply to the lake, even as early as in 1993, the government built 12 deep tube wells to supplement water supply to the lake. However, most tube wells were dysfunctional, thereby aggravating the problem. The Union Ministry for Environment and Forests included Pushkar Lake on a list of five lakes under the National Lake Conservation Project (NLCP) for restoration. They have been providing funds since 2008 for the restoration works, but the situation has not eased.\n\nDevelopment plans are under various stages of implementation to address the critical issues related to the lake. They aim to improve water quality, increase water storage capacity, prevent encroachment of the lake periphery, improve the ambiance around the lake, as well as to introduce recreational and revenue generating schemes.\n\nSewage outfalls into the lake are proposed to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders into the lake and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation in the bed of feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation to reduce the risk of death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.\n\n\n"}

The river was designated by \"Backpacker\" magazine as one of the 10 best rivers for canoeing in the United States.\n\nAlong the National Scenic River are numerous waterfalls that empty into the river from the surrounding cliff and canyon walls; the highest one is Smith Falls, which drops almost 63 feet (19 m) into the river valley. There are short sections of Class I and II rapids on the river, and several locations further downstream require a portage around the rapids. The westernmost 26 miles (40 km) of the Scenic River section, from the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge (just east of Valentine) to the Rocky Ford portage, offer outstanding canoeing, kayaking, and tubing opportunities. Although the remainder of the river can be paddled, access is limited by private landholder permission. Around 75,000 people visit the river annually, with the months of June through August being the busiest. Water levels decline slightly in late summer, but the river can still be enjoyed by canoe, kayak, and inner tube. To reach the first public access on the Scenic River section, drive northeast of Valentine on Nebraska Highway 12 until the sign for the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge put-in.\n\nConsidered an extraordinary example of a Great Plains river, the Niobrara is home to over 500 plant species many at or beyond their usual range, including many not otherwise naturally found within several hundred miles. These species include birch, ponderosa pine and a rare hybrid aspen (quaking X bigtooth). Species from six different vegetation communities can be found in proximity. Northern boreal forest types occur on north facing slopes where shade and abundant ground water create cooler microclimates. Species growing here include paper birch, aspen, ferns and club mosses. Rocky Mountain forest plants include ponderosa pine, serviceberry, and horizontal juniper. Eastern deciduous forests grow on the moist bottom lands and islands of the Niobrara. They include American elm, basswood, cottonwood, green ash, bur oak, hackberry and box elder. Three types of prairie are found in the river valley, displaying a botanical transition between among the eastern tallgrass prairie, the Sandhills mixed-grass prairie, and Northern Mixed-grass prairie. Mule deer, beaver, mink, pronghorn, river otter and even bison can be found in the area. Approximately 300 bison and a few dozen elk are protected in the 19,000 acre (77 km) Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge, which is located along the river.\n\nIn the Niobrara river, minnows such as sand shiners, red shiners and flathead chubs search for their food of aquatic insects near streambank margins. Larger fish, such as rainbow and brown trout, prefer cooler, clear water where springbranch canyon tributaries enter the river. Channel catfish, a popular game fish, prefer deeper waters or cover during the day and feed at night in the riffles. Softshell, snapping or painted turtles may be found sunning on logs in summer.\n\nThe scenic river is spanned by 15 bridges, including six which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n"}

{"id": "2297979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297979", "title": "Hilde Gueden", "text": "Hilde Gueden\n\nThe Austrian soprano Hilde Gueden, or Güden (15 September 1917 – 17 September 1988), was one of the most appreciated Straussian and Mozartian sopranos of her day. Her youthful and lively interpretations made her an ideal interpreter of roles like Zerbinetta in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" and Susanna in \"Le nozze di Figaro\".\n\nShe was born Hulda Geiringer in Vienna, and studied singing with Otto Iro, piano with Maria Wetzelsberger, and dancing at the Vienna Music Academy. She debuted, as Hulda Gerin, in 1937 in Benatzky's operetta \"Herzen im Schnee\" at the Vienna Volksoper. Her operatic debut came in 1939, when she sang Cherubino in \"Le nozze di Figaro\" at the Zurich Opera.\n\nIn 1941, the famous conductor Clemens Krauss engaged her for the Munich State Opera, where she sang with much success. From this time she used Hilde Gueden as her stage name. However, she had some Jewish ancestry, and this forced her to leave Germany under the Nazis. Rumour has it that she was almost arrested by the Gestapo in Munich, but she had by then obtained a fake passport showing that she was a Roman Catholic Polish woman and could avoid arrest.\n\nIn Italy, Tullio Serafin invited her to sing Sophie (\"Der Rosenkavalier\") in Rome and Florence. From then on, she gained great successes in Paris, Milan, London, Venice, Glyndebourne, and other major cities. She made her debut at Salzburg Festival in 1946 by singing Zerlina in Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" in 1946. In 1947, she started a long membership with the Vienna Staatsoper, where she was still of the greatest stars up to 1973. In December 1951, she debuted at the Metropolitan Opera as Gilda in \"Rigoletto\". In 1953, she sang Ann Trulove in the first U.S. performance of Stravinsky's \"The Rake's Progress\" at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nFrom late 1950s, she moved from light parts to lyric parts in the same operas; from Susanna to Countess Almaviva (\"Le nozze di Figaro\"), from Zerlina to Donna Elvira (\"Don Giovanni\"), from Despina to Fiordiligi (\"Così fan tutte\"), from Nannetta to Alice Ford (\"Falstaff\"), and from Musetta to Mimi (\"La bohème\"). She was also praised for her performances of Violetta in \"La traviata\", Marguerite in \"Faust\", and Micaela in \"Carmen\".\n\nShe was a most versatile and accomplished singer. Besides her usual Mozart and Richard Strauss, she was also an ideal operetta singer. Her Rosalinde in \"Die Fledermaus\" is considered one of her best roles. In the bel canto repertoire, she became a famous Gilda in \"Rigoletto\" and Adina in \"L'elisir d'amore\". She was also noted for her Lieder and oratorio work.\n\nShe died, aged 71, in Klosterneuburg.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hilde Gueden made dozens of recordings with the best artists of her generation, especially for the Decca/London label. Following is a selection of her recorded works:\n\n1. Mozart: \"Le nozze di Figaro\" (as Susanna) with Lisa della Casa, Cesare Siepi, and Erich Kleiber (conductor); Vienna State Opera Chorus and Vienna Phiharmonic Orchestra; rec.1955 (Decca)\n\n2.

{"id": "2297980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297980", "title": "Hydroxychloroquine", "text": "Hydroxychloroquine\n\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ), sold under the brand name Plaquenil among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat malaria in areas where malaria remains sensitive to chloroquine. Other uses include treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and porphyria cutanea tarda. It is taken by mouth. HCQ is being studied to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). High-quality evidence of benefit for such use is lacking, with concerns of potential harms from side effects.\nCommon side effects may include vomiting, headache, changes in vision, and muscle weakness. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions, vision problems, and heart problems. Although all risk cannot be excluded, it remains a treatment for rheumatic disease during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine is in the antimalarial and 4-aminoquinoline families of medication.\nHydroxychloroquine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In 2017, it was the 128th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than five million prescriptions. The speculative use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID‑19 threatens its availability for people with established indications.\n\nHydroxychloroquine treats rheumatic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and porphyria cutanea tarda, and certain infections such as Q fever and certain types of malaria. It is considered the first-line treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. Certain types of malaria, resistant strains, and complicated cases require different or additional medication.\n\nIt is widely used to treat primary Sjögren syndrome but does not appear to be effective. Hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of post-Lyme arthritis. It may have both an anti-spirochete activity and an anti-inflammatory activity, similar to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe drug label advises that hydroxychloroquine should not be prescribed to individuals with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. There are several other contraindications, and caution is required if the person considered for treatment has certain heart conditions, diabetes, or psoriasis.\n\nThe most common adverse effects are nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Other common adverse effects include itching and headache. The most serious adverse effects affect the eye, with dose-related retinopathy as a concern even after hydroxychloroquine use is discontinued. Serious reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine use include agitation, mania, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations, psychosis, catatonia, paranoia, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In rare situations, hydroxychloroquine has been implicated in cases of serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Reported blood abnormalities with its use include lymphopenia, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytosis.\n\nFor short-term treatment of acute malaria, adverse effects can include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heart problems, reduced appetite, headache, nausea and vomiting. Other adverse effects noted with short-term use of HCQ include low blood sugar and QT interval prolongation. Idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions have occurred.\n\nFor prolonged treatment of lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, adverse effects include the acute symptoms, plus altered eye pigmentation, acne, anemia, bleaching of hair, blisters in mouth and eyes, blood disorders, cardiomyopathy, convulsions, vision difficulties, diminished reflexes, emotional changes, excessive coloring of the skin, hearing loss, hives, itching, liver problems or liver failure, loss of hair, muscle paralysis, weakness or atrophy, nightmares, psoriasis, reading difficulties, tinnitus, skin inflammation and scaling, skin rash, vertigo, weight loss, and occasionally urinary incontinence. Hydroxychloroquine can worsen existing cases of both psoriasis and porphyria.\n\nChildren may be especially vulnerable to developing adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine.\n\nOne of the most serious side effects is retinopathy (generally with chronic use). People taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine or less per day generally have a negligible risk of macular toxicity, whereas the risk begins to increase when a person takes the medication over five years or has a cumulative dose of more than 1000 grams. The daily safe maximum dose for eye toxicity can be computed from a person's height and weight. Macular toxicity is related to the total cumulative dose rather than the daily dose. Regular eye screening, even in the absence of visual symptoms, is recommended to begin when either of these risk factors occurs.\n\nToxicity from hydroxychloroquine may be seen in two distinct areas of the eye: the cornea and the macula. The cornea may become affected (relatively commonly) by an innocuous cornea verticillata or vortex keratopathy and is characterized by whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits. These changes bear no relationship to dosage and are usually reversible on cessation of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThe macular changes are potentially serious. Advanced retinopathy is characterized by reduction of visual acuity and a \"bull's eye\" macular lesion which is absent in early involvement.\n\nHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are extremely toxic in overdose. Serious symptoms of overdose generally occur within an hour of ingestion. These symptoms may include sleepiness, vision changes, seizures, coma, stopping of breathing, and heart problems such as ventricular fibrillation and low blood pressure. Loss of vision may be permanent. Low blood potassium, to levels of 1 to 2 mmol/L, may also occur. Cardiovascular abnormalities such as QRS complex widening and QT interval prolongation may also occur.\n\nChloroquine has a risk of death in overdose in adults of about 20%, while hydroxychloroquine is estimated to be two or three fold less toxic. While overdoses of hydroxychloroquine have historically been uncommon, one report documented three deaths out of eight cases.\nTreatment recommendations include early mechanical ventilation, heart monitoring, and activated charcoal. Supportive treatment with intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be required with epinephrine being the vasopressor of choice. Stomach pumping may also be used. Sodium bicarbonate and hypertonic saline may be used in cases of severe QRS complex widening. Seizures may be treated with benzodiazepines. Intravenous potassium chloride may be required, however this may result in high blood potassium later in the course of the disease. Dialysis does not appear to be useful.\n\nThe drug transfers into breast milk. There is no evidence that its use during pregnancy is harmful to the developing fetus and its use is not contraindicated in pregnancy.\n\nThe concurrent use of HCQ and the antibiotic azithromycin appears to increase the risk for certain serious side effects with short-term use, such as an increased risk of chest pain, congestive heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular causes. Care should be taken if combined with medication altering liver function as well as aurothioglucose (Solganal), cimetidine (Tagamet) or digoxin (Lanoxin). HCQ can increase plasma concentrations of penicillamine which may contribute to the development of severe side effects. It enhances hypoglycemic effects of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Dose altering is recommended to prevent profound hypoglycemia. Antacids may decrease the absorption of HCQ. Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nWhile there may be a link between hydroxychloroquine and hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, this risk may be low in those of African descent.\n\nSpecifically, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) drug label for hydroxychloroquine lists the following drug interactions:\n\nHydroxychloroquine has similar pharmacokinetics to chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption, large distribution volume, and elimination by the kidneys. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, 2C8, 3A4 and 3A5) metabolize hydroxychloroquine to \"N\"-desethylhydroxychloroquine. Both agents also inhibit CYP2D6 activity and may interact with other medications that depend on this enzyme.\n\nAntimalarials are lipophilic weak bases and easily pass plasma membranes. The free base form accumulates in lysosomes (acidic cytoplasmic vesicles) and is then protonated, resulting in concentrations within lysosomes up to 1000 times higher than in culture media. This increases the pH of the lysosome from four to six. Alteration in pH causes inhibition of lysosomal acidic proteases causing a diminished proteolysis effect. Higher pH within lysosomes causes decreased intracellular processing, glycosylation and secretion of proteins with many immunologic and nonimmunologic consequences. These effects are believed to be the cause of a decreased immune cell functioning such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and superoxide production by neutrophils. HCQ is a weak diprotic base that can pass through the lipid cell membrane and preferentially concentrate in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles. The higher pH of these vesicles in macrophages or other antigen-presenting cells limits the association of autoantigenic (any) peptides with class II MHC molecules in the compartment for peptide loading and/or the subsequent processing and transport of the peptide-MHC complex to the cell membrane.\n\nHydroxychloroquine increases lysosomal pH in antigen-presenting cells. In inflammatory conditions, it blocks toll-like receptors on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs). Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9), which recognizes DNA-containing immune complexes, leads to the production of interferon and causes the dendritic cells to mature and present antigen to T cells. Hydroxychloroquine, by decreasing TLR signaling, reduces the activation of dendritic cells and the inflammatory process.\n\nIn 2003, a novel mechanism was described wherein hydroxychloroquine inhibits stimulation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 family receptors. TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses through activation of the innate immune system.\n\nAs with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the antimalarial mechanism of action of quinine has not been fully resolved. The most accepted model is based on hydrochloroquinine and involves the inhibition of hemozoin biocrystallization, which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing death.\n\nHydroxychloroquine increases the risk of low blood sugar through several mechanisms. These include decreased clearance of the hormone insulin from the blood, increased insulin sensitivity, and increased release of insulin from the pancreas.\n\nThe wholesale cost in the developing world was about per month , when used for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. In the United States the wholesale cost of a month of treatment is about . In the United Kingdom this dose costs the National Health Service about £5.15.\n\nIt is frequently sold as a sulfate salt known as hydroxychloroquine sulfate. 200 mg of the sulfate salt is equal to 155 mg of the base.\n\nBrand names of hydroxychloroquine include Plaquenil, Hydroquin, Axemal (in India), Dolquine, Quensyl, Quinoric.\n\nOn 17 March 2020, the AIFA Scientific Technical Commission of the Italian Medicines Agency expressed a favorable opinion on including the off-label use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID‑19.\n\nIn the US, several state pharmacy boards reported that some doctors and dentists were writing prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, to themselves, family members, and staff. Sudden demand spikes caused by hospital use for severely ill COVID‑19 patients and prescriptions for prophylaxis have resulted in shortages; doctors have expressed concern that patients who have long taken hydroxychloroquine for other approved indications, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, will be unable to procure needed medicine.\n\nOn 28 March 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and used for certain people who are hospitalized with COVID‑19.\n\nIn anticipation of product shortages, the FDA issued product-specific guidance for chloroquine phosphate and for hydroxychloroquine sulfate for generic drug manufacturers. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is not recommended outside the context of a clinical trial due to safety concerns with this combination and no clinically demonstrable benefit to combining these medications.\n\nDuring a press briefing on 19 March 2020; Donald Trump, the President of the United States, promoted the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for COVID‑19. Trump claimed that chloroquine had been FDA \"approved very, very quickly\" while discussing treatments for COVID-19. The FDA later said they had not given approval for the drug to be used in treatment of COVID-19, but was now allowing chloroquine under compassionate use guidelines. Trump's remarks led to a shortage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.\n\nA related compound, chloroquine phosphate, is used for the treatment of fish parasites and infections. It has a different chemical structure from chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which, when used in humans and other animals, could result in death. In the state of Arizona, a man died, leaving his wife in critical condition, as a result of ingesting a product containing chloroquine phosphate designed for treating sick fish. The couple believed the fish treatment could prevent them from contracting COVID‑19.\n\nOn 18 May 2020, Trump publicly stated that he was taking hydroxychloroquine combined with zinc and an initial dose of azithromycin during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite evidence indicating that it is \"linked to higher rates of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pre-existing conditions\", and other studies that show it to be ineffective. The World Health Organization suspended hydroxychloroquine from its global drug trials for COVID-19 treatments on 26 May 2020 due to safety concerns. It had previously enrolled 3,500 patients from 17 countries in the Solidarity Trial, which was the official name of its study of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19. Due to the increased risks, France, Italy and Belgium also banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment.. None of the results used as the basis of these bans involved outpatient treatment. The first results for outpatient clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin are expected in September 2020.\n\nOn 29 May 2020, the EMA issued a public health statement reminding healthcare professionals to closely monitor people with COVID-19 who are receiving hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThere is no strong scientific evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine for preventing or treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While its use is not approved by the FDA for COVID‑19 treatment, as of April 2020, there is an Emergency Use Authorization for its use, and it has been used off label for potential treatment of the disease. On 24 April 2020, citing the risk of \"serious heart rhythm problems\", the FDA posted a caution against using the drug for COVID‑19 \"outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial\".\n\nIn May 2020, a multinational study of 96,032 people with COVID‑19 from 671 hospitals found that use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without azithromycin or clarithromycin) provided no benefit, but instead increased the risk of heart arrhythmias and death compared to those who did not receive these drugs in their treatment. The study strongly recommended that the drug not be used outside of carefully controlled trials. There is no strong evidence supporting the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for COVID‑19 treatment. Concerns have arisen about both the database and methodology used for the study.\n\nOn 29 May 20202, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a list of references of observational studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID-19.\n\n"}

In 1936, her 24-room residence there was declared a state historic monument. In 1967, a plaque was unveiled to indicate that Carpenter had once lived there. At the age of seven, she moved with her family to Austin. Carpenter stood in the forefront of the Women's Movement when it began and never wavered from her platform. Her projects and causes ranged from supporting high tech to fighting cancer. Often called the \"funniest woman in politics\", she was in demand as a public speaker until her death.\n\nCarpenter launched her journalism career at Austin High School in Austin as the editor of the school paper, \"The Austin Maroon\". Another aspiring journalist, Leslie E. \"Les\" Carpenter (ca. 1921–1974) of Austin, was business manager of the newspaper. The two became best friends, majored in journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, and worked together on the university newspaper, \"The Daily Texan\". Liz Carpenter was a member of Texas Orange Jackets, the University's oldest women's honorary service organization. Les firmly supported Liz when she was elected vice president of the student body, the first woman to have held that position.\n\nIn 1942, Carpenter began covering the White House and Congress for the \"Austin American-Statesman\". For the next eighteen years, she reported on presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy as a Washington reporter.\n\nLes and Liz Carpenter were married on June 17, 1944, after he was discharged from the United States Navy during World War II. They launched the Carpenter News Bureau in the National Press Building in Washington, D.C. For the next sixteen years Carpenter covered Congress and the White House for various newspapers in Texas. She missed work only briefly when their two children, Scott and Christy, were born.\n\nShe was still a working reporter at the time of the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. She soon joined the staff of Lyndon B. Johnson in his campaign for Vice President in 1960 and traveled on his foreign missions as a press spokeswoman. After Kennedy's election, she became the first woman executive assistant to the vice-president.\n\nCarpenter was in Dallas on November 22, 1963, at the time of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She drafted the fifty-eight words that Johnson used on his return to Washington:\n\nFollowing Johnson's succession to the presidency, Carpenter became the first professional newswoman to be press secretary to a first lady for Lady Bird Johnson (1963–1969), for whom she also served as staff director. Carpenter also contributed to the speeches of President Johnson, particularly in the field of humor by creating the White House Humor Group.\n\nAfter the Johnson Administration ended in 1969, she wrote \"Ruffles and Flourishes\", her account of her White House experiences.\n\nShe was a vice president of Hill and Knowlton in Washington after leaving the White House. In 1971, she was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and co-chair of ERAmerica, traveling the country to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nShe was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the International Women's Year Commission, by President Jimmy Carter to serve as Assistant Secretary of Education for Public Affairs, and by President Bill Clinton to serve on the White House Conference on Aging.\n\nCarpenter was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1977 to 1983.\n\nIn 1974, Les Carpenter died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-two, just a year after the death of Lyndon Johnson. In 1976, Carpenter returned to Austin: \"Family roots, the love for Texas and the University of Texas and the LBJ Library brought me back home.\" She purchased a house, which she named \"Grass Roots\", located in the West Lake Hills overlooking the Austin skyline and the Colorado River\nHer books include: \"Unplanned Parenthood\", Random House 1994; \"Getting Better All the Time\", Simon and Schuster 1986, as well as countless articles and forays on the lecture circuit. \"Start With a Laugh\", gives humorous advice on speech writing, was published by Eakin Press and launched at the opening of the National Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future in Dallas. Her most recent book, \"Presidential Humor\", Bright Sky Press 2006, is a compilation of quips and quotes from \"George the First to George the Worst.\"\n\nCarpenter was named a Distinguished Alumna of the University of Texas in 1975, and in 1990 was named distinguished alumnae of the Department of Communications. She was named by Governor Mark White to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. She was given the ProBene Award of the College of Liberal Arts.\n\nThe Liz Carpenter Lectureship was established in 1984 by a group of her friends, including Erma Bombeck and Mark Russell, who gave a performance at the Paramount Theater to raise funds for it.\nIn the last several years, Mrs. Carpenter's lectureship in the College of Liberal Arts has brought President Bill Clinton, President Gerald Ford, Hillary Clinton, Jehan Sadat, Maya Angelou, Bill Moyers, Jane Goodall, and writers such as Betty Friedan, Nora Ephron, Shana Alexander, and Jean Auel and nationally known humorists such as Fannie Flagg and Carol Channing.\n\nThe Liz Carpenter Award is given annually for the best scholarly book on the history of women and Texas published during the calendar year. The Award was established in 1992 by an anonymous donor who is committed to the publication of scholarly research on the history of women and Texas. The award honors Liz Carpenter, a sixth-generation Texan, for her commitment to the pursuit of the history of women in Texas and for a lifetime of achievements that qualify her as a maker of that history.\n\nShe is the recipient of Alpha Phi's Frances E. Willard Award in 1980. She died in Austin, Texas in March 2010.\n\n\"Liz Carpenter is much more than an American original: she is an American and a Texas original. Her inside stories of our nation's political life over the last half-century are priceless.\" —Walter Cronkite\n\n\"No one remains the same person after meeting Liz ...(she) makes Auntie Mame look like a shut-in.\" —Erma Bombeck\n\n\"Her combination of wit and wisdom is infectious, encouraging, enlightening.

{"id": "2298005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298005", "title": "New Zealand Customs Service", "text": "New Zealand Customs Service\n\nThe New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) (In Māori, \"Te Mana Ārai o Aotearoa\") is a state sector organisation of New Zealand whose role is to provide border control and protect the community from potential risks arising from international trade and travel, as well as collecting duties and taxes on imports to the country.\n\nNew Zealand's current Minister of Customs is Jenny Salesa.\n\nCustoms is the oldest government department in New Zealand. Formed on 5 January 1840, it pre-dates the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi by one month. Its early establishment was necessary to collect revenue for the fledgling government, and over the years duties, tariffs and taxes collected by Customs have remained a major source of revenue for the country, although customs has also been used to impose various control over the movement of people and the distribution of particular products, in particular alcohol and tobacco.\n\nIn 1996, the New Zealand Customs Department was renamed the New Zealand Customs Service.\n\nIn recent years Customs has modernised itself in order to keep pace with new technologies and the ever-increasing volumes of international passengers and trade, while balancing its law enforcement and compliance obligations. Staffing levels sit between 1300 - 1500 nationally, with its head office located in Wellington. Staff are based at various ports and locations around New Zealand and are a mixture of frontline uniformed staff such as those seen at the airports and sea ports, as well as plainclothes staff in varying other roles.\n\nCustoms is a law enforcement agency in its own right, and is responsible for intercepting contraband, and checks international travelers and their baggage, as well as cargo and mail, for banned or prohibited items. Contrary to popular belief, it is not responsible for biosecurity items such as food and other agricultural items declared at ports of entry - this is the responsibility for the Ministry for Primary Industries. Customs is also responsible for assessing and collecting Customs duties, excise taxes and Goods and Services Tax on imports and protecting New Zealand businesses against illegal trade. It is second only to the Inland Revenue Department for the amount of revenue it collects for the New Zealand Government. It exercises controls over restricted and prohibited imports and exports, including objectionable material (such as child sex abuse images), drugs, firearms and hazardous waste and also collects import and export data.\n\nCustoms is responsible for documentation of all imports and exports (in 2006/7 this was 47 million imports and 33 million exports). Since 1999 all documentation to Customs has been electronic.\n\nCustoms works closely with New Zealand's other border agencies, the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Aviation Security Service (AvSec) and Immigration New Zealand. It also works very closely with the New Zealand Police and the Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand in joint operations involving the importation of drugs.\n\nCustoms established the Trade Single Window in 2013 to provide a single place to lodge import and export documents with all of New Zealand Government.\n\nWhilst an unarmed agency, some Customs officers are authorised to carry handcuffs and make arrests in relation to offences relating to the importation of drugs and other prohibited goods.\n\nCustoms is also the administrative body of the New Zealand Government responsible for the domestic collection and control of excise tax on tobacco and alcohol.\n\nCustoms officers continue to make significant seizures of pseudoephedrine, a precursor for Methamphetamine. Open source media and Customs reporting to government suggests that pseudoephedrine makes up the large majority of Customs seizures. These seizures have resulted in multiple arrests and successful prosecutions by Customs and Police officers.\n\nIn October 2010, then Comptroller of Customs Martyn Dunne advised a New Zealand Parliament committee that 796 kg of Pseudoephedrine, with a value of $90 million, had been seized in the nine months to 30 September, compared with 733 kg for the whole year in 2009. It was later revealed that Customs seized over a tonne of pseudoephedrine in 2010.\n\nCustoms officers are based at the main cities in New Zealand, as well as a number of smaller ports. Its headquarters is in Wellington, New Zealand's capital city. Customs also has liaison officers based at the following overseas locations: Bangkok, Beijing, Brussels, Canberra, Hong Kong, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.\n\nCustoms conducts national intakes, with the number of intakes per year varying dependent on the needs of the Service. Typically each intake will consist of 20 - 30 recruits who are referred to as 'cohorts'. Recruiting usually begins with Customs advertising nationwide, calling for applications for persons who meet requisite criteria. Applications are then reviewed and accepted or rejected. The majority of applicants are culled at this initial stage. Persons who pass the initial application process are then invited to 'open days' at central locations (usually Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch) during which they are given insights into the various roles Customs undertakes as well as being placed into groups and are assessed during group problem solving scenarios, where individuals are observed by assessors and are judged on various factors such as interaction, initiative and leadership traits. Those who are deemed suitable must then pass an interview, police checks and medical test before being offered a space on the next intake.\n\nTraining consists of a 6 week, classroom based course. This is gives new cohorts extensive knowledge in Customs, covering Customs history, relevant legislation, questioning techniques, physical training, self-defense training, and presentations from various other work areas In Customs. During the course, multiple examinations are undertaken, and if passed, new cohorts will be awarded their \"stripes\" in the form of epaulettes.\nFollowing the classroom course, there is on-the-job training for one year. At the conclusion of all training, cohorts will have a graduation ceremony where they will be awarded with a certificate confirming their graduation.\n\n"}

The bridge links the suburb of Mankhurd in Mumbai with Vashi in Navi Mumbai, the satellite city of Mumbai. It is one of four entry points into Mumbai (other three being the Airoli Bridge, Mulund check naka and Dahisar check naka), and handles traffic directed towards the region to the south and east of Mumbai.\n\nThe first bridge to connect Mumbai to Navi Mumbai was conceived by Adi Kanga and was built in 1973. The bridge is 1837m in length and has a substandard 3 lane carriageway. Within two years of its opening to traffic, corrosion cracks were noted on the bottom side of the prestressed girders of some spans. This led to a series of extensive repairs including external prestressing. It was simultaneously decided to construct a new bridge to replace the faulty one.\n\nConstruction on a new bridge began in 1987 and opened to traffic in 1992. The original Vashi Bridge or the 1st Thane Creek Bridge remains closed to traffic.\n\nA new bridge having a 6 lane divided carriageway and length of 1837.35 m (30 m down stream) was constructed from 1987 to 1997 with several unique features in the construction and design with emphasis on durability and a formal QA/QC programme. Proof Consultants were appointed to oversee each aspect of planning, design and construction. Open foundations were taken into the bedrock with foundation concrete being laid in the dry, with the sea water being pumped out using submersible pumps. The piers in the intertidal zone were protected by epoxy coal tar paint painted on 6 mm thick m.s. plate which was considered as a lost shuttering. The superstructure was a P.S.C. box girder, one for each carriageway, constructed using balanced cantilever cast-in-situ segments. The new bridge (also the Vashi Bridge) has performed without any problems whatsoever. This bridge was constructed by U.P State Bridge Corporation Ltd. for which it was awarded the most outstanding concrete structure award.\n\nThe new bridge is also known as the 2nd Thane Creek Bridge. The lane expansion work on Vashi Bridge, also known as the Thane Creek Bridge, is likely to begin later this year, with the authorities identifying a contractor for the work. Larsen and Toubro (L&T) emerged as the lowest bidder for the contract last week. \n\n"}

Towards the end of his playing career, Hughes took on coaching responsibilities, and was appointed manager of Falkirk in 2003 (initially as co-manager with Owen Coyle). Hughes guided Falkirk to promotion to the Scottish Premier League and a Scottish Cup Final during his time in charge. He eventually left Falkirk to take up the managerial role at Hibernian in 2009, but left by mutual consent after sixteen months.\n\nHughes was appointed manager of Livingston in February 2012, but left in November to take over at English club Hartlepool United. He departed Hartlepool in May 2013 after being unable to prevent their relegation to League Two. Hughes soon returned to football when he was appointed manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle in December 2013. He led the club to their first major silverware with the Scottish Cup in May 2015 and their first foray into European football. Hughes left Inverness in May 2016. He then had a brief stint with Raith Rovers, which ended in them being relegated to Scottish League One.\n\nHughes is \"one of six kids from the classic, working-class family\" in Leith. He started his playing career in junior football with Newtongrange Star, before beginning his senior career with Berwick Rangers, where he played as a striker. After a brief stint in the Football League with Swansea City, Hughes established himself as a central defender at Falkirk.\n\nHis playing career peaked when he signed for Celtic in 1995. He scored a late, headed equaliser in the derby against Rangers at Ibrox on 17 March 1996.\n\nHe subsequently played for his local club Hibernian, Ayr United and finally returned to Falkirk in a joint player and coaching role.\n\nHughes shares his name with former Celtic, Crystal Palace and Sunderland player John 'Yogi' Hughes. As a result, Hughes is often referred to as 'Yogi' himself. He famously performed a streak during his first stint at Falkirk whilst team-mate Mo Johnston was being interviewed for STV's Scotsport.\n\nHughes landed his first managerial job in 2003, when he and Owen Coyle were appointed co-managers of Falkirk. Coyle subsequently left Falkirk to join Ian McCall at Dundee United, leaving Hughes in sole charge. He then guided Falkirk to promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2005. As well as maintaining their SPL status for four seasons, Hughes led Falkirk to the 2009 Scottish Cup Final.\n\nHughes was appointed Hibernian manager in the 2009 close season. He led the club to Europa League qualification in his first season in charge, as they finished in fourth place in the SPL. Poor results at the start of the following season, however, led to fans jeering their own team. Hughes left the club by mutual consent on 4 October following a 2–0 defeat against St Johnstone.\n\nHughes interviewed for the Swindon Town job in the 2011 close season. Hughes was appointed manager of Livingston on 14 February 2012.\n\nAfter nine months at Livingston, Hughes moved to English club Hartlepool United. He took the job when the team were in the midst of a 20-match-run without a win. Despite an upturn in form that earned him a Manager of the Month award, Hartlepool were relegated to Football League Two. Hughes publicly stated his desire to remain at the club, but he was sacked on 9 May 2013.\n\nHughes was appointed manager of Scottish Premiership club Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 4 December 2013 on a two-and-a-half-year contract. Soon after this appointment, Hughes led Inverness CT to their first major final after beating Hearts in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final of the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup. Inverness drew 0–0 against Aberdeen in the final, but, after extra-time, lost the tie 4–2 on penalties.\n\nAt the beginning of season 2014–15, \"Caley Thistle's\" excellent early performances led him to receive the award of SPFL Manager of the Month for August. He followed this by also winning the award for January 2015, as his Inverness side continued to impress. In April 2015, Hughes led \"Caley Thistle\" to their first ever Scottish Cup final after a controversial 3–2 win over favourites, Celtic, and at the end of the month he was shortlisted for PFA Scotland Manager of the Year. On 3 May, Hughes was announced as the winner of the managerial award, ahead of Ronny Deila, Derek McInnes and Robbie Neilson. Further success soon followed as he guided Inverness to a highest ever league finish – 3rd place, and with it, a milestone debut in European competition for the club. The accolades continued, with Hughes winning the SFWA Manager of the Year award, to complete the managerial 'double' for 2014–15. He led the club to their first major silverware with a Scottish Cup final success over his old club Falkirk in May 2015 to conclude the club's most successful season.\n\nHughes left Inverness at the end of the 2015–16 season.\n\nHughes was appointed manager of Scottish Championship club Raith Rovers in February 2017. The club finished ninth in the Championship, and were relegated to League One after they lost in the playoffs to Brechin City. Immediately after the game, Raith announced that Hughes and his assistant Kevin McBride would be leaving the club.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298021", "title": "Menispermaceae", "text": "Menispermaceae\n\nMenispermaceae ( Botanical Latin : 'Moonseed Family' from Greek \"mene\" 'crescent moon' and \"sperma\" 'seed' ) is a family of flowering plants. The alkaloid Tubocurarine, a neuromuscular blocker and the active ingredient in the 'tube curare' form of the dart poison curare, is derived from the South American liana Chondrodendron tomentosum. Several other South American genera belonging to the family have been used to prepare the 'pot' and calabash' forms of curare. The family contains 68 genera with some 440 species, which are distributed throughout low-lying tropical areas with some species present in temperate and arid regions.\n\n\nIt is thought that the cauliflorous species are pollinated by small bees, beetles or flies although there are no direct observations of this. Birds disperse the purple or black drupes, for example \"Sayornis phoebe\" (a Tyrant flycatcher) eats the fruit of \"Cocculus\". In \"Tinospora cordifolia\" a lapse of 6–8 weeks has been observed between fertilization and the first zygotic cell division.\n\nThe menispermaceae predominantly inhabit low altitude tropical forests (up to 2,100m), where they are climbers, but some genera and species have adapted to arid locations (\"Antizoma\" species have adapted to the South African deserts or \"Cocculus balfouri\" and its phylloclades have adapted to the climate on the island of Socotra) and other temperate climates. C3 photosynthesis has been recorded in \"Menispermum\".\n\nThe family contains a wide range of benzylisoquinoline compounds (alkaloids) and lignans such as furofuran, flavones and flavonols and some proanthocyanidins. The most notable are the wide variety of alkaloids derived from benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline and aporphine, which accumulate as dimers, as well as the alkaloids derived from morphinan and from hasubanan and other diverse types of alkaloid such as derivative of aza-fluoranthene. Sesquiterpenes such as picrotoxin and diterpenes such as clerodane diterpene are also present, while the triterpenes are scarce and where present are similar to oleanane. Ecdysone steroids have also been found. Some species are cyanogenic.\n\nThe Menispermaceae have been used in traditional pharmacopeia and drugs have been formulated from these plants that are of great use in modern medicine. These drugs are based on alkaloids and include tubocurarine from curare, a poison used by indigenous South American tribes on their poison darts, that is obtained from species of Curarea, Chondrodendron, Sciadotenia and Telitoxicum. A similar poison was used in Asia (ipos) that was obtained from species of Anamirta, Tinospora, Coscinium and Cocculus. Tubocurarine and its synthetic derivatives are used to relax muscles during surgical interventions. The roots of \"kalumba\" or \"colombo\" (\"Jateorhiza palmata\") are used in Africa for stomach problems and against dysentery. Species of \"Tinospora\" are used in Asia as antipyretics, the fruit of \"Anamirta cocculus\" is used to poison fish and birds and the stems of \"Fibraurea\" are used to dye fabric yellow. The South East Asian species \"Coscinium fenestratum\", a local Thai remedy for stomach ailments ( which contains berberine and related alkaloids ) was recently implicated in mass harvesting operations to prepare extracts usable as precursors in the manufacture of the drug MDMA.\n\nThe extinct genus \"Callicrypta\" from the Siberian Middle Cretaceous appears to be referable to Menispermaceae.\n\nThe APG II system (2003; unchanged from the APG system of 1998) recognizes this family and places in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. Their trimerous flower structure is similar to the Lardizabalaceae and Berberidaceae, although they differ from them in other important characteristics. The APW (Angiosperm Phylogeny Website) considers that they form part of the Order Ranunculales, and that they are a sister group on the branch formed by the Lardizabalaceae and Berberidaceae families in a reasonably advanced clade of the order (cf. AP-website). Kinship with the Berberidaceae is further borne out by similarities in phytochemistry e.g. in the presence of berberine and related alkaloids. It is a medium-sized family of 70 genera totaling 420 extant species, mostly of climbing plants. The great majority of the genera are tropical, but with a few (notably \"Menispermum\" and \"Cocculus\") reaching temperate climates in eastern North America and eastern Asia.\n\nThe genetic factors within this family are very narrow, as there are many genera with one or a few species. There is not currently enough data from genetic studies to evaluate either this situation or the traditional division into five tribes (see Kessler, 1993, in the References section). This division is fundamentally based on characteristics of the seed (endosperm and cotyledons) but there is doubt as to whether the tribes are monophyletic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298022", "title": "Ice cream parlor", "text": "Ice cream parlor\n\nIce cream parlors (American English) or ice cream parlours (British English) are places that sell ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and/or frozen yogurt to consumers. Ice cream is typically sold as regular ice cream (also called hard-packed ice cream), and/or soft serve, which is usually dispensed by a machine with a limited number of flavors (e.g., chocolate, vanilla, and \"twist\", or \"zebra\", a mix of the two). Ice cream parlors generally offer a number of flavors and items. Parlors often serve ice cream and other frozen desserts in cones, cups or dishes, the latter two to be eaten with a spoon. Some ice cream parlors prepare ice cream desserts such as sundaes (ice cream topped with syrup, whipped cream and other toppings) or milkshakes, or even a blend (known as a Boston shake).\n\nWhile the origins of ice cream are often debated, most scholars trace the first ice cream parlor back to France in the 17th century. In 1686, Francesco Procopio del Coltelli opened Paris' first café. The Café Procope, named by its Sicilian founder, introduced gelato to the French public. The dessert was served to its elite guests in small porcelain bowls.\n\nUntil 1800, ice cream remained a rare and exotic dessert enjoyed mostly by the elite. The introduction of insulated ice houses in 1800, the first ice cream factory in Pennsylvania in 1851, and industrial refrigeration in the 1870s made manufacturing and storing ice cream much simpler. The first ice cream factory was built by Jacob Fussell, a milk dealer who bought dairy products from Philadelphia farmers and sold them in Baltimore. The mass production of ice cream cut the product's cost significantly, making it more popular and more affordable for people of lower classes.\nIn the early 1800s, an early form of a U.S. ice cream parlor was existent in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that sold \"all kinds of refreshments, as Ice Cream, Syrups, French Cordials, Cakes, Clarets of the best kind, Jellies, etc.\" According to one source, the first U.S. ice cream parlor opened in New York City in 1790.\n\nGelato is a type of Italian ice cream with more milk and less cream than American ice cream. Sorbet is a frozen treat made from fruit, syrup and ice. No milk or cream is used. Frozen yogurt is a common low-fat ice cream alternative with a smooth texture that is similar to soft serve ice cream. All of these frozen products may be sold in ice cream cones, cups, sundaes, and milkshakes. Some parlors may also sell ice cream cakes, ice cream bars and other pre-packaged frozen sweets. In addition to frozen dessert products, some modern ice cream parlors also sell a variety of hot fast foods.\n\nParlors vary in terms of size and environment. Some only have an order window and outside seating, while others have complete indoor facilities. Some parlors have drive-through windows. There are even parlors that combine several of these methods. Some parlors remain open all year round, typically in warmer weather locations and urban areas, and others in colder climates stay open only during warmer months, particularly from March to November. For example, some ice cream parlors in Vienna, Austria close in the winter months. \n\nSome ice cream parlors in Moscow, Russia, offer alcoholic beverages along with ice cream.\n\nBecause ice cream parlors are located throughout the world, there are both small, local franchises as well as large, global enterprises. Some of the most notable large, global ice cream parlors include Baskin-Robbins, Ben & Jerry's, Bruster's Ice Cream, Carvel, Cold Stone Creamery, Dairy Queen, Dippin' Dots, Friendly's, and Häagen-Dazs. Yogurtland, Yogen Früz, and sweetFrog are notable frozen yogurt parlors.\n\nJust as the size, style, and selection within each ice cream parlor may differ, so may its notoriety. Each July in the United States, in honor of National Ice Cream Month, several prominent publications rank the popularity of ice cream parlors throughout the United States. In 2014, Travel + Leisure, National Geographic, Business Insider, Food & Wine, and TripAdvisor published their top ranked ice cream parlors.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298023", "title": "Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior", "text": "Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior\n\nThe sinking of the \"Rainbow Warrior\", codenamed Opération Satanique, was a bombing operation by the \"action\" branch of the French foreign intelligence services, the \"Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure\" (DGSE), carried out on 10 July 1985. During the operation, two operatives sank the flagship of the Greenpeace fleet, the \"Rainbow Warrior\", at the Port of Auckland in New Zealand on its way to a protest against a planned French nuclear test in Moruroa. Fernando Pereira, a photographer, drowned on the sinking ship.\n\nFrance initially denied responsibility, but two French agents were captured by New Zealand Police and charged with arson, conspiracy to commit arson, willful damage, and murder. As the truth came out, the scandal resulted in the resignation of the French Defence Minister Charles Hernu. The two agents pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to ten years in prison. They spent a little over two years confined to the French island of Hao before being freed by the French government.\n\nSeveral political figures, including then New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, have referred to the bombing as an act of terrorism or state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nFrance began testing nuclear weapons in 1966 on Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. In 1985 eight South Pacific countries, including New Zealand and Australia, signed a treaty declaring the region a nuclear-free zone.\n\nSince being acquired by Greenpeace in 1977, \"Rainbow Warrior\" was active in supporting a number of anti-whaling, anti-seal hunting, anti-nuclear testing and anti-nuclear waste dumping campaigns during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since early 1985, the ship was based in the southern Pacific Ocean, where its crew campaigned against nuclear testing. After relocating 300 Marshall Islanders from Rongelap Atoll, which had been polluted by radioactivity by past American nuclear tests, it travelled to New Zealand to lead a flotilla of yachts protesting against French nuclear testing at the Mururoa Atoll.\n\nDuring previous nuclear tests at Mururoa, protest ships had been boarded by French commandos after sailing into the shipping exclusion zone around the atoll. For the 1985 tests, Greenpeace intended to monitor the impact of nuclear tests and place protesters on the island to monitor the blasts.\n\nFrench agents posing as interested supporters or tourists toured the ship while it was open to public viewing. DGSE agent Christine Cabon, who had previously worked on intelligence missions in the Middle East, posed as environmentalist \"Frederique Bonlieu\" in order to infiltrate the Greenpeace office in Auckland. While working for the Auckland office, Cabon secretly monitored communications from the \"Rainbow Warrior\", collected maps, and investigated underwater equipment.\n\nThree agents on board the yacht \"Ouvéa\" imported the limpet mines used for the bombing. Two more agents, Dominique Prieur and Alain Mafart, posing as the newlywed couple \"Sophie and Alain Turenge\", picked up the mines and delivered them to the bombing team, consisting of the divers Jean Camas (\"Jacques Camurier\") and Jean-Luc Kister (\"Alain Tonel\").\n\nAfter sufficient information had been gathered, Camas and Kister attached two limpet mines to the \"Rainbow Warrior\" berthed at Marsden Wharf. They were detonated 10 minutes apart. The first bomb went off at 23:38, blasting a hole about the size of an average car. The agents may have intended the first mine to cripple the ship so that it would be evacuated safely by the time the second mine was detonated. However, the crew did not react to the first explosion as the agents had expected. While the ship was initially evacuated, some of the crew returned to the ship to investigate and film the damage. A Portuguese-Dutch photographer, Fernando Pereira, returned below decks to fetch his camera equipment. At 23:45, the second bomb went off. Pereira drowned in the rapid flooding that followed, and the other ten crew members either safely abandoned ship on the order of Captain Peter Willcox or were thrown into the water by the second explosion. The \"Rainbow Warrior\" sank four minutes later.\n\n\"Operation Satanic\" was a public relations disaster. France, being an ally of New Zealand, initially denied involvement and joined in condemning what it described as a terrorist act. The French embassy in Wellington denied involvement, stating that \"the French Government does not deal with its opponents in such ways\".\n\nAfter the bombing, the New Zealand Police started one of the country's largest police investigations. They identified two of the French agents, Captain Dominique Prieur and Commander Alain Mafart, as possible suspects. Prieur and Mafart were identified with the help of a Neighbourhood Watch group, and arrested. Both were questioned and investigated. Because they were carrying Swiss passports, their true identities were discovered, along with the French government's responsibility.\n\nThe other agents of the French team all escaped from New Zealand. Christine Cabon, whose role had ended before the bombing, had left for Israel immediately prior to the sinking. After she was identified as a participant in the operation, Auckland police requested that the Israeli authorities detain her. Cabon was tipped off and fled before she could be arrested.\n\nThree other agents, Chief Petty Officer Roland Verge (\"Raymond Velche\"), Petty Officer Jean-Michel Bartelo (\"Jean-Michel Berthelo\") and Petty Officer Gérard Andries (\"Eric Audrenc\"), who had carried the bombs to New Zealand on the yacht \"Ouvéa\", escaped by that yacht, and were arrested by Australian police on Norfolk Island, but released as Australian law did not allow them to be held until the results of forensic tests came back. They were then picked up by the French submarine \"Rubis\", which scuttled the \"Ouvéa\".\nSeveral agents, including Jean-Luc Kister, one of the bombers, had posed as tourists. They took a ferry to the South Island, went skiing at Mt Hutt, and then left the country using false documents about 10 days later. Another agent, Louis-Pierre Dillais, possibly the commander of the operation, was also never captured.\n\nOnce it was realised that the bombing was the action of the government of a friendly state, the New Zealand government stopped referring to it as a \"terrorist act\", instead calling it \"a criminal attack in breach of the international law of state responsibility, committed on New Zealand sovereign territory\". The \"breach of international law\" aspect was referred to in all communications with the United Nations in order to dissuade any arguments from the French government that might imply justification for their act.\n\nPrieur and Mafart pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on 22 November 1985. France threatened an economic embargo of New Zealand's exports to the European Economic Community if the pair were not released. Such an action would have crippled the New Zealand economy, which was dependent on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom.\n\nFrance launched their own commission of enquiry headed by which declared the French government innocent of any involvement in the terrorist act, claiming that the arrested agents, who had not yet pleaded guilty, had merely been spying on Greenpeace. When \"The Times\" and \"Le Monde\" contradicted these findings by claiming that President Mitterrand had approved the bombing, Defence Minister Charles Hernu resigned and the head of the DGSE, Admiral Pierre Lacoste, was fired. Eventually Prime Minister Laurent Fabius admitted the bombing had been a French plot: on 22 September 1985, he summoned journalists to his office to read a 200-word statement in which he said: \"The truth is cruel,\" and acknowledged there had been a cover-up; he went on to say that \"Agents of the French secret service sank this boat. They were acting on orders.\"\n\nIn the wake of the bombing, a flotilla of private New Zealand yachts sailed to Moruroa to protest against a French nuclear test.\n\nAt that time, French nuclear tests in the Pacific were halted. However, another series of tests was conducted in 1995.\n\nA Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior benefit concert at Mt. Smart Stadium, Auckland, on 5 April 1986 included performances by Herbs, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Topp Twins, Dave Dobbyn and a Split Enz reunion.\n\nThe \"Rainbow Warrior\" was refloated for forensic examination. She was deemed irreparable and scuttled in Matauri Bay, near the Cavalli Islands on 12 December 1987, to serve as a dive wreck and fish sanctuary. Her masts had been removed and put on display at the Dargaville Maritime Museum.\n\nOn 14 October 2011, Greenpeace launched a new sailing vessel called \"Rainbow Warrior III\", which is equipped with an auxiliary electric motor.\n\nIn 1987, after international pressure, France paid $8.16m to Greenpeace in damages, which helped finance another ship. It also paid compensation to the Pereira family, reimbursing his life insurance company for 30,000 guilders and making reparation payments of 650,000 francs to Pereira's wife, 1.5 million francs to his two children, and 75,000 francs to each of his parents.\n\nThe failure of Western leaders to condemn this violation of a friendly nation's sovereignty caused a great deal of change in New Zealand's foreign and defence policy. New Zealand distanced itself from the United States, a traditional ally, and built relationships with small South Pacific nations, while retaining excellent relations with Australia and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom.\n\nIn June 1986, in a political deal with Prime Minister of New Zealand David Lange, presided over by United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, France agreed to pay NZ$13 million (US$6.5 million) to New Zealand and apologise, in return for which Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur would be detained at the French military base on Hao Atoll for three years. However, the two agents had both returned to France by May 1988, after less than two years on the atoll. Mafart returned to Paris on 14 December 1987 for medical treatment, and was apparently freed after the treatment. He continued in the French Army and was promoted to colonel in 1993. Prieur returned to France on 6 May 1988 because she was pregnant, her husband having been allowed to join her on the atoll. She, too, was freed and later promoted. The removal of the agents from Hao without subsequent return was ruled to be in violation of the 1986 agreement.\n\nFollowing the breach of the arrangement, in 1990 the secretary-general awarded New Zealand another NZ$3.5 million (US$2 million), to establish the New Zealand / France Friendship Fund. Although France had formally apologised to the New Zealand Government in 1986, during a visit in April 1991 French Prime Minister Michel Rocard delivered a personal apology. He said it was \"to turn the page in the relationship and to say, if we had known each other better, this thing never would have happened\". The Friendship Fund has provided contributions to a number of charity and public purposes. During a visit in 2016, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls reiterated that the incident had been \"a serious error\".\n\nIn 2005, French newspaper \"Le Monde\" released a report from 1986 which said that Admiral Pierre Lacoste, head of DGSE at the time, had \"personally obtained approval to sink the ship from the late president François Mitterrand.\" Soon after the publication, former Admiral Lacoste came forward and gave newspaper interviews about the situation, admitting that the death weighed on his conscience and saying that the aim of the operation had not been to kill. He acknowledged the existence of three teams: the yacht crew, reconnaissance and logistics (those successfully prosecuted), plus a two-man team that carried out the bombing.\n\nOn the twentieth anniversary of the sinking, it was revealed that Mitterrand had personally authorised the mission.\n\nA 20th anniversary memorial edition of the 1986 book \"Eyes of Fire: The Last Voyage of the Rainbow Warrior\" by New Zealand author David Robie – who was aboard the bombed ship – was published in July 2005.\n\nTwenty years after the bombing, Television New Zealand (TVNZ) sought access to a video record made at the preliminary hearing in which the two French agents pleaded guilty. The footage had remained sealed since shortly after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. The two agents opposed release of the footage—despite having both written books on the incident—and unsuccessfully took the case to the New Zealand Court of Appeal and, subsequently, the Supreme Court of New Zealand. On 7 August 2006, judges Hammond, O'Regan and Arnold dismissed the former French agents' appeal and TVNZ broadcast their guilty pleas the same day.\n\nIn 2005, in an interview with New Zealand state broadcaster TVNZ, Louis-Pierre Dillais acknowledged his involvement with the bombing.\nIn 2007 the New Zealand Green Party criticized the government over its purchase of arms from Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal, whose U.S. subsidiary was led by Dillais. At that time, Greenpeace was still pursuing the extradition of Dillais for his involvement in the act.\n\nIn 2006, Antoine Royal revealed that his brother, Gérard Royal, had claimed to be involved in planting the bomb. Their sister is French Socialist Party politician Ségolène Royal who was contesting the French presidential election. Other sources identified Royal as the pilot of the Zodiac inflatable boat that carried the bombers. The New Zealand government announced there would be no extradition request since the case was closed.\n\nIn September 2015, TVNZ's \"Sunday\" programme tracked down Jean-Luc Kister, one of the two bombers. Kister, who retired from the DGSE in about 2000, admitted his lead role and feelings of responsibility for the lethal attack. He also pointed to the French President, as commander of the armed forces and intelligence services assigned the operation. Reporter John Hudson, who spent two days with Kister in France, said that Kister \"wanted an opportunity to talk about his role in the bombing... It has been on his conscience for 30 years. He said to us, 'secret agents don't talk', but he is talking. I think he wanted to be understood.\" Kister considered the mission \"a big, big failure\".\n\n\n\n\nFilms (all are productions for television):\n"}
{"id": "2298034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298034", "title": "Rape culture", "text": "Rape culture\n\nRape culture is a sociological concept for a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality. Behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include victim blaming, slut-shaming, sexual objectification, trivializing rape, denial of widespread rape, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by sexual violence, or some combination of these. It has been used to describe and explain behavior within social groups, including prison rape and in conflict areas where war rape is used as psychological warfare. Entire societies have been alleged to be rape cultures. It is associated with rape fantasy and rape pornography.\n\nThe notion of rape culture was developed by second-wave feminists, primarily in the United States, beginning in the 1970s. Critics of the concept dispute the existence or extent of rape culture, arguing that the concept is too narrow or that, although there are cultures where rape is pervasive, the idea of a rape culture can imply that the rapist is not at fault but rather the society that enables rape.\n\nThere have been many movements that been made in order to address rape culture, such as SlutWalk and Me Too. These movements have helped share people's stories through the use of hashtags which are embodied and connected to rape.\n\nThe term \"rape culture\" was first coined in the 1970s in the United States by second-wave feminists and was applied to contemporary American culture as a whole. During the 1970s, second-wave feminists had begun to engage in consciousness-raising efforts designed to educate the public about the prevalence of rape. Previously, according to Canadian psychology professor Alexandra Rutherford, most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating rarely happened. The concept of rape culture posited that rape was common and normal in American culture, and that it was one extreme manifestation of pervasive societal misogyny and sexism. Rape was defined as a crime of violence rather than a crime of sex as it had been before and the focus of rape shifted from desire for sexual pleasure to one of male domination, intimidation and a sense of control over gender norms. Rape also started to be reexamined through the eyes of the victims rather than the perpetrators.\n\nThe first published use of the term appears to have been in 1974 in \"\", edited by Noreen Connell and Cassandra Wilson for the New York Radical Feminists. In the book, the group stated that \"our ultimate goal is to eliminate rape and that goal cannot be achieved without a revolutionary transformation of our society\". This book, along with Susan Brownmiller's 1975 \"Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape\", was among the earliest to include first-person accounts of rape. Their authors intended to demonstrate that rape was a much more common crime than previously believed. In the book, Brownmiller comments upon the idea that women never spoke about rape because women would never want to be open about a \"crime against their physical integrity\" which explained the general public's ignorance over how often rape was occurring and to whom. Brownmiller, a member of the New York Radical Feminists, argued that both academia and the general public ignored the incidents of rape. She helped spark psychologists to begin observing and studying what sparked this \"rape supportive culture\". Her book, \"Against Our Will\", is considered a landmark work on feminism and sexual violence, and it is one of the pillars of modern rape studies.\n\nSociology professor Joyce E. Williams traces the origin and first usage of the term \"rape culture\" to the 1975 documentary film \"Rape Culture,\" produced and directed by Margaret Lazarus and Renner Wunderlich for Cambridge Documentary Films. She said that the film \"takes credit for first defining the concept\". The film discussed rape of both men and women in the context of a larger cultural normalization of rape. The film featured the work of the DC Rape Crisis Center in co-operation with Prisoners Against Rape, Inc. It included interviews with rapists and victims, as well as with prominent anti-rape activists such as feminist philosopher and theologian Mary Daly and author and artist Emily Culpepper. The film explored how mass media and popular culture have perpetuated attitudes towards rape.\n\nIn a 1992 \"Journal of Social Issues\" paper entitled \"A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change\", Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio suggested that the term originated as \"rape-supportive culture\" in Brownmiller's \"Against Our Will.\" By the mid-1970s, the phrase began to be used more widely in multiple forms of media.\n\nFeminists and gender activists conceptualize rape culture as a cultural environment that encourages gender violence, as well as perpetuating \"rape myths\", ranging from treating rape as merely \"rough sex\" to blaming the victim for inviting rape. \n\nMichael Parenti believes that rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as victim blaming, reluctance by authorities to go against patriarchial cultural norms, as well as fears of stigmatization suffered by rape victims and their families. Other sociologists posit that rape culture links non-consensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial worldviews, laced with misogyny and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape.\n\nOne explanation for the commonality of these myths is that only certain \"bad\" or \"misbehaved\" women are raped. This creates a category of women separated from the general population which encourages an \"otherness\" and reduces the idea that anyone is vulnerable to being raped. One common rape myth is that no event is random. This promotes the idea that the women who are raped were not raped for no reason, but that they deserved it. If women believe that they were the cause of the rape, they may not go to authorities. Society also uses the stereotype of men being aggressive as an excuse for their actions. This justifies and normalizes rape. Society creates these myths, scaring women before they are even raped. Another reason for the acceptance of rape culture is the \"just-world\" hypothesis which claims that what happens to an individual in life is inherently tied to their actions and thus seen as justly deserved. People who believe in this theory would also be more likely to believe women who are raped deserve it in some way. Finally, rape can be attributed to ways women were treated historically, as a factor used to oppress and create control over women.\n\nBrownmiller, in \"Against Our Will\", discusses three ideas that helped bring awareness to some clearly defined rape myths of the early to mid 20th century. First, any woman can be a rape victim regardless of age, size, shape, ethnicity, or status. Second, any man can be a rapist, not just \"evil\" or \"mentally ill\" men as thought in previous decades. Finally, rape can occur in many different forms besides the stereotype of a violent, forceful rape done by a stranger.\n\nThe idea any women could be raped was a new proposition that called attention to the notion of victim blaming. Now that rape could affect anyone, there would not be a proper way for men and women to avoid it. Some rape myths that were widely accepted on the basis of what kind of women would be raped were ideas that the victim was always \"young, careless [and] beautiful\" or they are \"loose\" women who \"invite rape\" by provoking men.\" Although Brownmiller's idea about victim blaming was supposed to expose rape myths thus eradicating victim-blaming, blaming the victim in rape circumstances is still a common practice.\n\nRape culture can manifest when third parties separate the sexual violence of select individuals and cast them off as deviant perverts rather than acknowledging that anyone can be capable of rape. In the 1960s, rapists were often seen as mentally ill or deviants in society, and this view persisted among some people into the 1990s.\n\nRape cases in which both parties previously knew one another has been coined as \"acquaintance rape\", a term first coined by Robin Warshaw in 1988, and subsequently used by prominent academics such as Mary P. Koss.\n\nChris O'Sullivan asserts that acts of sexism are commonly employed to validate and rationalize normative misogynistic practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being, or a rape victim might be blamed for being raped because of how she dressed or acted. O'Sullivan examines rape culture and fraternities, identifying the socialization and social roles that contribute to sexual aggression, and looks at \"frat life\" and brotherhood ideals of competition and camaraderie. In these groups, sex is viewed by young men as a tool of gaining acceptance and bonding with fellow \"brothers\", as they engage in contests over sex with women. In O'Sullivan's article, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as part of a continuum in a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.\n\nTo some, the root cause of rape culture is the \"domination and objectification of women\". However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture. Rape culture is a fluid and always-changing entity that is socially produced and socially legitimated, so throughout time and place its definitions will change. Reasoning about rape and rape culture is also influenced by gender and heterosexuality norms. For example, in South Africa the overriding \"war culture\", which emphasized masculinity and violence, led to a culture in which rape was normalized. A University of California Davis public document alleged that major causes of rape were the enforcement of women having to follow social rules and the conditioning of gender roles. Others say in a rape culture women are conditioned to assume responsibility for male sexuality, and gender roles are socially constructed and enforced on women through fear.\n\nSince the late 20th century, researchers and activists have repeatedly returned to the issue of rape culture on university campuses, especially in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. Often, victims are dissuaded from reporting sexual assaults because of universities' and colleges' ambivalent reactions to rape reports and desire to suppress bad news. Victims may not want to risk stigmatization and scrutiny in their lives, especially in campus society. Victim-hood is a social creation, and is associated with stigma. Definitions of what counts as \"rape\" and who is treated as a \"genuine victim\" are constructed in discourse and practices that reflect the social, political, and cultural conditions of society. For instance, rape victims may not be considered as such if it appears they did not struggle or put up a fight. Their emotional responses are observed and reported during investigations to aid in deciding if the victim is lying or not. In addition, college administration officials have sometimes questioned accounts of victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventive legislation as the Clery Act, which requires colleges to report on crimes.\n\nRape culture is closely related to slut-shaming and victim blaming, in which rape victims are considered at fault for being raped. Scholars argue that this connection is made due to a culture that shames all female sexuality that is not for the purpose of reproduction in a hetero-normative married household. That some victims do not report rapes to the police due to fear of not being believed is often cited as a symptom of a rape culture. 6% of women who did not report rape said it was because of fear of not being believed by police.\n\nVictim blaming is part of a phenomenon known as 'Rape Myth Acceptance,' a term coined by researcher Martha Burt in the 1980s. It is defined as prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists which can range from trivializing rape, denial of widespread rape, labeling an accuser as a liar, stating that most rape accusations are false, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or accepting that the victim \"deserved it\" because she was defined as a slut. Another cause of victim blaming has been the vague understanding of what constitutes rape in the scenario of a victim wanting to have sex with the perpetrator. If a victim wants to have sex but refuses to consent to sex and the perpetrator continues, the situation would be considered rape; however, it becomes easier for others to blame the victim for the situation because he or she did \"want to have sex\".\n\nFeminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of pornography, which is seen as an expression of a culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity. Accounts of rapists often feature fusion of several pornographic motifs.\n\nPrison rape is a topic about which jokes are abundant. Linda McFarlane, director of Just Detention International, states \"Humor is part of the cultural attitude that (prison) is the one place where rape is okay.\"\n\nSexualization and sexual objectification are practices that contribute to the normalization of hyper-sexualized perceptions of women, which is a theme in rape culture. Hyper-sexualized or pornographic media is often attributed with perpetuating aggressive behaviors and attitudes supporting violence against women. Media depictions of violent sexual activity are also noted to increase behavioral aggression. Sexualizing imagery surfaces and reinforces misogynistic beliefs in some instances. This media can come in forms of movies, music, advertising, video games and more.\n\nConsumption of pornography has shown to possibly encourage aggressive action as well. Positive associations between aggressive perceptions of women and consumption of pornography, especially violent pornography, have been found on multiple occasions. Individuals who more frequently consume pornography are more likely to engage in sexually aggressive acts or harbor sexually aggressive attitudes than others who consume less pornography or do not consume pornography at all.\n\n\"Victim blaming\" is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime is partially or entirely attributed as responsible for the transgressions committed against them. For instance, a victim of a crime (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggest that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim their own fault.\n\nVictim blaming may also occur among a victim's peers, and college students have reported being ostracized if they report a rape against them, particularly if the alleged perpetrator is a popular figure or noted athlete. Also, while there is generally not much general discussion of rape facilitated in the home, schools, or government agencies, such conversations may perpetuate rape culture by focusing on techniques of \"how not to be raped\" (as if it were provoked), vs \"how not to rape.\" This is problematic due to the stigma created and transgressed against the already victimized individuals rather than stigmatizing the aggressive actions of rape and the rapists. It is also commonly viewed that prisoners in prison deserve to be raped and is a reasonable form of punishment for the crimes they committed. Another factor of victim blaming involves racism and racial stereotypes.\n\n\"Slut shaming\" is a variant on victim blaming, to do with the shaming of sexual behavior. It describes the way people are made to feel guilty or inferior for certain sexual behaviors or desires that deviate from traditional or orthodox gender expectations. A study of college women from sociologists at the University of Michigan and the University of California found that slut-shaming had more to do with a woman's social class than it did with their activity. Slut shaming can create a double standard between men and women and discrimination. The SlutWalk movement aims to challenge victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.\n\nRape culture has been described as detrimental to both women and men. Some writers and speakers, such as Jackson Katz, Michael Kimmel, and Don McPherson, have said that it is intrinsically linked to gender roles that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men. According to political scientist Iris Marion Young, victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim. Others link rape culture to modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be \"rape free\" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and become visible in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that result in their using rape to suppress women.\n\nOthers also link rape culture to environmental insecurities, where men objectify women as part of their struggle to control their immediate environment. It is also linked to gender segregation, and the belief that rape proves masculinity. Other manifestations of rape culture include denial of widespread rape, institutional apathy toward the problem of rape, minimization of rape cases by government officials, and excusing rapists as social anomalies.\n\nOne concern is that the rape culture in the United States can influence juror decision-making in sexual assault trials. The result is that men who have committed sexual assault crimes may receive little to no punishment, which serves to strengthen the rape culture in the American judicial system and American society as a whole. In addition to the law as written not being put into effect in practice, legal definitions of rape have been criticized for placing a high burden of proof on victims to demonstrate non-consent. Individuals likely use legal definitions and jury convictions in their conceptualization of “real rape.” Laws, which are passed by (mostly male) lawmakers, tend to represent dominant groups' interests. Larcombe et al. posit \"a legal definition of rape as non-consensual penetration achieved through unlawful force, coercion, fraud or exploitation – that is, containing a fault element that describes the tactic the perpetrator used to effect the assault – may conform more closely to social and social science definitions of rape.\" In contrast, in some jurisdictions (e.g. Kentucky, Connecticut, Arkansas, Alaska, Alabama) words alone are still not sufficient to legally prove non-consent.\n\nAccording to a study by Acta Obstetrecia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, of a set of \"nearly 300 women who visited [a particular rape clinic],\" it was found that \"70 percent experienced at least 'significant' tonic immobility and 48 percent met the criteria for 'extreme' tonic immobility during the rape.\"\n\nThe legal process can be so traumatizing for victims that even professionals in the area would warn someone they care about against participating.\n\nAccording to Ann Burnett, the concept of rape culture explains how society perceives and behaves towards rape victims and rape perpetrators. For example, a number of rape myths that are held are \"no means yes\", women can resist rape if they really wanted to, women who are raped are promiscuous therefore \"asking to be raped\" and many women falsely report rape to protect their own reputations or because they are angry at the \"perpetrator\" and want to create a type of backlash. A theory for why rape myths are so common in society is because they are perpetuated by norms already present in society. Researchers claim that communication and language is created by the dominant patriarchy. In positions of power, men control how women are portrayed in the media, women's censorship of body and voice, etc. which forces women to submit to the gender stereotypes formed by the dominant culture. The dominance of the male language in society creates the concept of a \"slutty woman\" and forces women to begin to monitor their behavior in fear of how they will be perceived within the rape culture.\n\nOne effect rape culture has on women is their lack of understanding or a feeling of ambiguity surrounding the idea of consent and rape. Burnett's study followed college women's experiences of rape revealing that many students could not define what the term rape really meant, did not believe consent had to be verbal and felt sexual consent was always vague and hard to pinpoint. Along with this were people believing women who had \"allegedly been raped\" were \"asking for it\" because of how they were dressed or their flirtatious behavior. Women in the study also assumed that men expected sex in exchange for drinks or dinner bought earlier for the woman. Because of their lack of awareness of what rape was and because of how they were acting/what they were wearing, women believed they had in some way provoked the rape to happen. Some women also did not report the rape if it did not fit the stereotypical version of rape, physical injury and force committed by a stranger. When raped by someone the individual knew, women felt less inclined to label the assault as rape. They could not, therefore, report the incident or rape because they were either confused about what had happened or believed it to be their own fault.\n\nAfter a rape has already occurred or after the victim acknowledged that she has been raped, women still did not report the incident because they felt it would ultimately hurt or punish them. Some reasons that women did not report their rape is because they did not want to bring attention to themselves, psychologically, they did not want to have to remember what had happened to them, and they did not want people to find out and gain a negative reputation. Because of the existing rape myths mentioned above, women knew that reporting rape could potentially make them out to be a \"slut\" or \"easy\" and garnish a reputation that would affect how others perceived them. Many women noted that they felt that they could not even admit the rape to friends and family they trusted most because they were so afraid of the repercussions. Women felt that they would not be supported, would have their validity questioned or be blamed for the incidents that happened. As a result, rape can lessen women's trust in others and make them feel isolated.\n\nAnother effect rape culture has on young women is a victim's self-reflection. After a rape, women reported feeling dirty, thought of themselves as slutty, and believed that they had \"used or damaged goods.\" Women felt ashamed of themselves for what had happened and felt that they no longer fit the ideal \"pure and virginal\" stereotype that men want. Women's belief that they were somehow rotten and their feelings that no one would want to be with them after the rape created feelings of depression and anxiety amongst victims.\n\nIf women do choose to discuss their rape with others, many still remain under scrutiny unless it is proven that they are telling the truth. Men belonging to the college study reported that they felt the rape was validated if the woman had taken the accusation to court and then won. Only then was the rape taken seriously by men. Men were also more likely to victim blame than women for the rape, especially if the case was not reported. Women who chose not to tell or chose to tell only people who were close to her were often deemed liars or exaggerators when others found out about the rape. Because no legal action was attempted, onlookers often believed that the rape was \"not a big deal\" or \"must not have happened.\" Without some kind of validation from a person in authority, rape, according to college students in the study, was believed to not be as prominent or affect as many women as was the reality.\n\nAlthough there is a wide range of research on the consequences of sexual violence on victims, there is little information on the economic effect, especially for economically vulnerable victims such as Black and Latina women. These consequences of sexual violence disproportionately harm these specific demographics, because they make up a large portion of the group afflicted by income-poverty and asset poverty. Simply being from one of these poverty backgrounds increases the risk of sexual violence and discourages victims from reporting a rape crime as there is less confidence in the police services and there is a higher crime rate in areas of poverty.\n\n\"Toxic masculinity\"—a concept posited by some feminist scholars—is a number of negative traits and expectations burdening men in society.\n\nSociety has such strict notions regarding males and how they are supposed to act. However, when males are the victims of sexual assault people don’t normally believe it and that it cannot happen to males as normally they are the perpetrators that engage in the rape. Men are portrayed as strong, tolerant and emotionally resilient to these kinds of actions. Many of the men that are victims of rape are often blamed and told that they allowed it to happen because they did not fight hard enough. This concept of how men are supposed to act has created such strict notions of how men are supposed to present themselves. When men come forward and report the assault, they are often met with dismissal, and rejection by authority figures and medical practitioners. Often men have trouble when it comes to vulnerability and when men come forward with their assault, authority figures will often treat them little respect as their masculinity has been questioned.\n\nAfter a male has experienced a sexual assault, there have been many reported incidences of negative effects such as suicidal thoughts, depressive episodes, sexual dysfunctions, feelings of self-worthlessness, extreme anxiety and guilt which end up putting a strain on their future relationships. This shows that females and males have similar reactions when observing the trauma that is associated with rape victims.\n\nSexual assault that happens upon men from other men has only been recognized as existing in prisons, however, there has been a steady incline of male rape taken place among incarcerated men. Mitchell et al., (1999) presents that male rape takes place among male college students who were either forced or pressured into sexual acts. When it comes to male sexual assault, gay men are more likely to be rape victims and will not be treated as fairly as a lesbian when it comes to the judicial system. Rumney (2009) mentions how homosexuals and the gay community are at risk of becoming rape and sexual assault victims. In addition, Rumney suggests that being labeled as homosexual, it increases their risk to be a victim of sexual assault. When a male is sexually assaulted and they are labeled as homosexual it can create negative attributes and unjust treatments towards them in by the criminal justice system. An interesting fact that Rumney found was that homosexuals males are more willing to report a rape rather than heterosexual males.\n\nChapleau, Oswald, Russel (2008) address how we need to break down the gender differences in rape myths and learn to accept that it happens to both sexes. When it comes to how societies function on a social and ideological force, due to the fact that males and females experience the same negative effects such as rape, we need to start addressing and breaking down the rape myths. Whereas, Whatley and Riggio (1993) found that males blame the victim more than females even when the victims are males.\n\nWhile research about rape culture has been mostly conducted in Westernized countries, particularly the United States, there are a number of other countries that have been described as \"rape supportive\" societies. These places have similarities to Western countries in terms of beliefs and gender stereotyping, but there are some significant differences that explain the high rate of rape and sexual assault in these less developed parts of the world.\n\nIndia has a rape culture rooted in both its traditional Indian culture as well as its British colonial legacy, which blames victims of rape, is sympathetic to perpetrators, and which treats women who have been raped as \"damaged goods\" who then suffer further afterwards. While there are laws on the books to protect victims of rape, these laws are often not enforced, especially when the perpetrator is from a more powerful caste or is wealthier than the person who was raped, there is often a failure to properly gather evidence from rape victims and to care for them afterwards, and there is little legal assistance for them. Two main types of rape that are prevalent in Indian Society which are political rapes and honor (izzat) rapes. Beyond the typical type of assault for dominance and control, comes rape with the intention of revenge. Because women are not seen as individuals but rather as objects or possessions, rape is sometimes a political move to seek revenge against an enemy. Fights and feuds are settled by raping the rival's mother, wife, daughter or sister. Honor rapes are used as a tactic to take away sometime of value belonging to the woman. Because women are seen as objects for men to possess, taking away her honor through rape diminishes her worth. The societal attitude of linking a woman’s celibacy with family honor compels her to safeguard the family’s honor in India. However, in the case of rape, instead of endeavoring to transform male-dominated, socially constructed, biased attitudes, people expect women to change by demanding that they dress properly or restrict their activities.\n\nHistorically in India, journalistic coverage of rape and sexual abuse has been limited and typically prejudiced against the victim. Women victims who reported rape were seen as people who do not believe in preserving the honor of their family. The victim often fights a lonely battle against her tormentor where justice is not delivered timely. The increase in media coverage of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case helped to draw attention to the prevalence of sexual brutality towards women in India.\n\nAccording to NCRB 2015 statistics, Madhya Pradesh has the highest raw number of rape reports among Indian states, while Jodhpur has the highest per capita rate of rape reports in cities. Experts say that a woman is raped in India every 16 minutes. India, thus has been dubbed \"the most dangerous country for women\" by many human rights activists.\n\nViolence against women is seen as a private matter not believed to be \"appropriate for intervention or policy changes\". This is due to Pakistan's patriarchal society and gender roles that expect men to be violent and women to be fragile. Cultural norms also embrace violence and discrimination towards women, emphasizing that women would not be able to live alone without men. Normalization of violence against women continues to be reflected in the rates of rapes in Pakistan.\n\nRape is not often reported in Pakistan due to the inequality between the two genders. Some Women do not come out because they want to uphold their family's honor. Victims of rape that are discovered might lose their families, their husbands and their homes. They think of themselves as \"beghairat\" , a person without honor or someone who has lost self-respect, because of what has happened to them and they do not want to be stigmatized or humiliated by society. Women often feel discouraged from talking or reporting about their rape because of these reasons.\n\nA notable case occurred in 2002. 30-year-old Mukhtaran Bibi (Mukhtār Mā'ī) was gang raped on the orders of the village council as an \"honor rape\" after allegations that her 12-year-old brother had had sexual relations with a woman from a higher caste. In reality, he was kidnapped and sodomized by three men. Mukhar Maiai's 12-year-old brother, Abdul Shakoor (or Shakur), was abducted by three men from the Mastoi tribe, he was taken to a sugar field where he was gang raped and sodomized repeatedly. When the boy refused to stay silent about the incident, he was kept imprisoned in the home of Abdul Khaliq, a Mastoi man. When police came to investigate, Shakoor was instead accused of having an affair with Khaliq's sister, Salma Naseen, who was in her late 20s at the time. Shakoor was then arrested on charges of adultery but later released. In later trials, Shakoor's rapists were convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment. The Mastoi tribal council (jirga) convened separately regarding Shakoor's alleged affair with Naseen. They concluded that Shakoor should marry Naseen while Mai (a Gujar tribeswoman) be married to a Mastoi man. Villagers rejected this conclusion due to the belief that adultery must be punished with adultery. Mai was called to the council to apologize to the Mastoi tribe for her brother's actions. When she arrived, she was dragged to a nearby hut where she was gang raped in retaliation by 4 Mastoi men while an additional 10 people watched. Following the rape, she was paraded nude through the village . Although custom would expect her to commit suicide after being raped, Mukhtaran spoke up, and pursued the case, which was picked up by both domestic and international media. On 1 September 2002, an anti-terrorism court sentenced 6 men (including the 4 rapists) to death for rape.\n\nIn a study conducted by Rachel Jewkes, Yandina Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell and Kristin Dunkle, men from the three districts in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa were surveyed about rape. The prevalence among the men was high; about 1 in 4 men had raped another person, mostly young women.\n\nMen said they had committed rape for a number of different reasons. Many raped women and young girls for \"fun\" or out of boredom. Gang rapes were also quite common amongst the men, about 1 in 5 men had participated in one, which reflected the society's belief that it was common and \"what boys do\". Drinking and peer pressure were also common reasons for raping. A majority claimed they had raped because they were punishing the women, either acquaintances or girlfriends, for having made them angry. Sub-areas and communities saw rape as a legitimate punishment for women and reasonable under certain circumstances. Some men also had sex with very young women or virgins in order to \"cleanse themselves of diseases\". Young women were often targeted because they were virgins and because the men believed they were easy to overpower and would not report it. Men were not afraid of repercussions.\n\nResearchers have attempted to explain the high rate of rape in South Africa and have connected it to the traditional and cultural norms embedded within the society. Certain norms like the belief of rape myths, the inequality between men and women, and the need to express their dominance made the rape appear justified to the assailants. Many began raping when they were young teenagers for entertainment, reflecting the notion that rape is a pastime for young men and boys.\n\nRape and sexual violence are also prevalent in South Africa because of confusion about what is to be regarded as rape. Certain acts of sexual coercion may not be legally distinguishable. While the criminal offense of rape is condemned by the society, many rapes or sexual assaults might not be recognized as such and thus are not thought to be unacceptable behavior.\n\nActivist Pumla Dineo Gqola says that events like the rape trial of then Vice President and now President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma are not surprising and are a reflection of ideas of masculinity and femininity in contemporary South Africa.\nThe high rate of rape in South Africa, combined with the inability of the criminal justice system and the healthcare system to contain the crisis, have been compared to a 'gender civil war'. The majority of women in South Africa are raped by people they know. It is argued that rape in democratic South Africa has become socially acceptable and maintains patriarchal order.\n\nCorrective rape is a hate crime committed for the purpose of converting a gay person to heterosexuality. The term was first used in the early 2000s when an influx of these attacks were noted by charity workers in South Africa. This homophobic phenomenon and other ignorances perpetuate rape culture and put lesbian women at greater risk of rape. \nIntersectionality as a tool of analysis identifies that black lesbians face homophobia, sexism, racism and classism.\n\nOn 17 April 2016, a list of the names of 11 men and titled 'Reference List' was posted anonymously on Facebook. The post gave no descriptions or made any allegations. However, within a matter of time, students were able to connect what these students had in common which were rape allegations. The students demanded a suspension and investigation of the individuals on the list. The police were called to intervene in order to neutralize the protests at Rhodes University. This put rape in universities in the spotlight.\n\nOn 14 February 2012 the One Billion Rising campaign was launched globally. Its aims were to raise awareness of violence against women, to inspire action for justice and to promote gender equality. The ‘billion’ in the campaign’s title refers to the UN statistic that one in three women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime: approximately one billion women and girls. Many African countries were involved in the campaign, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Often cited as one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman, South Africa’s statistics for rape and gender-based violence galvanized thousands of South Africans to rise in support of the campaign at a range of events and through various media since the campaign’s inception.\n\nOn 6 August 2016, four women staged a silent protest at the IEC results announcement ceremony. The protesters said that they could not be silent given the rape and gender-based violence in South Africa. Even though President Jacob Zuma was acquitted of the charges, the young protesters says that an acquittal does not mean the president is innocent due to the failure of the legal system.\n\nCultural values stemming from traditional practices still influence South African rape culture. Ukuthwala, also known as \"wife abduction\", is a traditional marriage practice in which a man kidnaps a young woman with the intent of convincing the girl and her family to agree to the marriage. There are examples of this happening in Hindu societies of India as well. Another belief, kusasa fumbi or sexual cleansing, is the idea that having sex cleans the body, specifically from illnesses. A more specific type cleaning would be virgin cleansing, which is the belief that having sex with a virgin will eliminate deadly diseases such HIV/AIDS. Kusasa fumbi is a reflection of the indigenous medical views of the country.\n\nThere are societies in which rape is almost non-existent, such as the Minangkabau of Indonesia. According to anthropologist Peggy Sanday, rape is less likely to occur within cultures that are peaceful (have low rates of interpersonal violence), promote mutual respect between the sexes, and lack an ideology of male toughness (machismo). The society of Minangkabau has an Islamic religious background of complementarianism and places a greater number of men than women in positions of religious and political power. The culture is also matrilineal, so inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter. The society of Minangkabau exhibits the ability of societies to eradicate rape without social equity of genders.\n\nSome writers, academics and groups have disputed the existence or prevalence of rape culture or described the concept as harmful. Others believe that rape culture exists, but disagree with certain interpretations or analyses of it.\n\nThe Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), an anti-sexual violence organizations, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identified problems with an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, \"In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime.\" In the report, RAINN cites a study by David Lisak, which estimated that 3% of college men were responsible for 90% of campus rapes, though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators. RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape \"has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions\".\n\nProfessor Camille Paglia has described concerns about rape culture as \"ridiculous\" and \"neurotic\", an artifact of bourgeois liberal ideologies that people are essentially good and that all social problems can be remedied with education. This rape culture concept is much to the detriment of young college-educated women she says. Paglia argues that said individuals are ill-prepared to anticipate or cope with the small minority of deeply evil people in the world, who simply don't care about following laws or obeying social convention. Moreover, Paglia says, feminist proponents of rape culture tend to completely ignore male victims of sexual assault.\n\nCaroline Kitchens, in a 2014 article in \"Time Magazine\" titled \"It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria\" suggested that \"Though rape is certainly a serious problem, there's no evidence that it's considered a cultural norm. ...On college campuses, obsession with eliminating 'rape culture' has led to censorship and hysteria.\" Heather MacDonald suggested that \"In a delicious historical irony, the baby boomers who dismantled the university's intellectual architecture in favor of unbridled sex and protest have now bureaucratized both.\" According to Joyce E. Williams, \"the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men\".\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common \"one in four women will be raped in her lifetime\" claim is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, \"There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines.\"\n\nSommers and others have specifically questioned Mary Koss's oft-cited 1984 study that claimed 1 in 4 college women have been victims of rape, charging it overstated rape of women and downplayed the incidence of men being the victims of unwanted sex. According to Sommers, as many as 73% of the subjects of Koss's study disagreed with her characterization that they had been raped, while others have pointed out that Koss's study focused on the victimization of women, downplaying the significance of sexual victimization of men, even though its own data indicated one in seven college men had been victims of unwanted sex. Sommers points out that Koss had deliberately narrowed the definition of unwanted sexual encounters for men to instances where men were penetrated.\n\nOther writers, such as bell hooks, have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it is too narrowly focused; in 1984, she wrote that it ignores rape's place in an overarching \"culture of violence\". In 1993 she contributed a chapter to a book on rape culture, focusing on rape culture in the context of patriarchy in black culture.\n\nBarbara Kay, a Canadian journalist, has been critical of feminist Mary Koss's discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that \"rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture\" as \"remarkably misandric\".\n\nJadaliyya, an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, stating that orientalists had appropriated the term to promote racist stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men, as well as stereotypes of South Asians in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports demonizing Middle Eastern and South Asian men as \"racially prone to rape\" and similar tactics employed by the British as part of a racist Indophobic propaganda campaign during the 1857 rebellion casting resistance fighters as rapists.\n\nThe UN conducted its 'Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific' in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape. The study's general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study's methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study's sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape.\n\nSlutWalk is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made \nby Toronto police officer Michael Sanguinetti on 24 January 2011. While addressing the issue of campus rape at a York University safety forum, Sanguinetti said that \"women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized\". In addition, it also happened in India created by a group of college students to help address the violence enacted upon women. The SlutWalk happening in India shows that it is intended for women everywhere and that it should not only focus on urban women.\n\nThe SlutWalk movement are credited with popularizing the term via mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media. The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture—which they define as a culture in which \"sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable\"—and to end slut-shaming and victim blaming. One primary goal of this organization is to deconstruct the stigma that often comes with being a victim of rape or sexual assault. Ringrose and Renold said that \"the stigma relates to the way women dress and behave, but in fact male sexual aggression is the problem\". A SlutWalk that took place in London promoted several different kinds of attire including lingerie, nipple, tassels, and T-shirts with slogans to demonstrate what women wear is not a form of consent for sex. The SlutWalk of Philadelphia was rebranded as The March to End Rape Culture. The idea behind the name change is so the walk can be more inclusive and promotes more diversity in its participants, volunteers, and sponsors. The original SlutWalk took place in the city of Toronto, Ontario. Amber Rose is also a figure in the United States where she holds her annual Amber Rose SlutWalk in Los Angeles, California while also raising awareness for empowerment and the Amber Rose Foundation.\n\nSlutWalks have taken place in some conservative Catholic countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. According to \"Sex and the Barrio\" writers Edgerton and Sotirova, SlutWalk protests began in South America taking on the name \"Marcha de las Putas\". They are protesting the idea that women dressed in revealing clothing are asking to get raped. They held the walk in the South American capitol of Buenos Aires on 28 September 1990, a day that was named the Day for the Decriminalization of Abortion in Latin America. Due to the overwhelming Catholic influence, some SlutWalks have taken on an anti-Catholic tone in response to sermons, such as the one in Costa Rica, where a leading clergyman preached that \"Women should dress modestly to avoid being 'objectified'\", adding that the purpose of sex is \"fertilization\". The march even reached the Cathedral of San Jose just as mass was concluding.\n\nRape culture is so prevalent within western society that it is often broadcast on social media. Media and sexual violence among individuals have been linked through social media coverage which re-enforces the notions of rape culture. Media coverage has allowed individuals the freedom to post whatever they please with little restrictions. Images that allude sexual content often demonstrate how they wish to be seen by others. This suggests that how people portray themselves online could reflect how they are treated and thus blaming the victim for inviting rape to happen. When individuals are posting provocative material about themselves it elicits a persona that reinforces the notions of gender-stereotypical ideas of being hyper-femininized.  However, when there is media coverage on a case that involves rape, the reporters and news stations often sympathize with the perpetrators especially if they are younger and had a career lined up. Media coverage and reporters often pity the perpetrators because they will be forever labeled as sex-offenders, there is often little talk about the victim but rather blaming the victims.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2298055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298055", "title": "First Unitarian Church of Rochester", "text": "First Unitarian Church of Rochester\n\nThe First Unitarian Church of Rochester is located at 220 Winton Road South in Rochester, New York, U.S. The congregation is one of the largest in its denomination, the Unitarian Universalist Association. The non-creedal church conducts programs in the areas of spirituality, social concerns, music, and arts. This church is one of two Unitarian Universalist congregations in Monroe County, the other being First Universalist Church of Rochester.\n\nThe church was organized in 1829. Associated with social reform movements from its earliest days, it began attracting a group of reform activists from Quaker backgrounds in the 1840s, one of whom, Susan B. Anthony, became a national leader of the women's suffrage movement. After the first women's rights convention was held at Seneca Falls, New York in 1848, a follow-up convention, the Rochester Women's Rights Convention, was organized two weeks later at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester. Abigail Bush was elected to preside at this convention even though the idea of a woman chairing a public meeting was considered too daring even for some of the leaders of the emerging women's movement who were present.\n\nConcern with social issues has been a recurring theme in the church's history. In the late 1800s the church provided evening classes and other activities for children in the church's low-income neighborhood. At the turn of the century, church members played leading roles in the campaign to open the University of Rochester to women and in the local, state, and national campaigns for women's suffrage. In the 1930s the church provided office space for Planned Parenthood when other accommodations were difficult to find. In 1988 the church began providing classroom support to Rochester city schools. In 2006 the church initiated a program to improve the quality of life in a small township in Honduras. In 2009 it established a talk line to offer non-judgmental support to women who have had abortions.\n\nFirst Unitarian's building was designed by Louis Kahn and completed in 1962. It was described as one of \"the most significant works of religious architecture of the century\" by Paul Goldberger, a Pulitzer-Prize-winning architectural critic.\n\nThe First Unitarian Church of Rochester in Rochester, New York, U.S., is one of the largest in its denomination, the Unitarian Universalist Association. Its senior minister is Shari Halliday-Quan. The church conducts two weekly worship services on Sundays and an occasional Saturday service.\n\nThe church is non-creedal, having, in the words of its web site, \"No single religious text. No ten commandments. No creed to which you must agree ... This respect for individual particularity and openness to diverse sources of wisdom means our community is packed with a wide array of perspectives and beliefs.\" The church's mission statement is: \"Creating connection by listening to our deepest selves, opening to life's gifts and serving needs greater than our own - every day!\" The church school has a stated goal of encouraging children \"to seek their own truths, to clarify their values, and to live lives of meaning inspired by those values.\"\n\nThe church operates on a Policy Governance system by which the board of trustees focuses on the long-term goals of the church while the parish minister oversees its operation. The board specifies the results expected from the parish minister and sets limits for his or her activities. The board does not specify how those expectations should be achieved, but it does evaluate the results. Officers of the church are elected by annual congregational meetings.\n\nIn the 1970s the church developed a task force system to coordinate its activities in the area of social concerns. Members interested in a specific activity gather signatures to qualify as one of the church's task forces, which, if approved by the congregation, will be eligible to receive funds from the church budget. Oversight is provided by the Social Justice Council, which is composed largely of representatives from the task forces. Through this system, the church sponsors projects that provide classroom support for Rochester schools, temporary shelter within the church for homeless families, free Sunday suppers at a Catholic Worker program, improvements to the quality of life in a small township in Honduras, and other projects that focus on such issues as peace, reproductive rights, and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender concerns. The Council also oversees grant programs that provide financial support to community organizations.\n\nThe church's music and arts programs include a choir, a house band, a handbell choir, a drama group, a chamber music series, a coffee house, and an art gallery. Interest groups sponsored by the church include Soul Matters groups that focus on monthly worship themes, several types of meditation groups, Wellspring groups with programs of daily spiritual practice, Buddhist groups, qi gong, tai chi, book discussion groups, and several types of support groups.\n\nThe First Unitarian Church of Rochester was organized in 1829.\n\nThe city of Rochester, located in western New York, was a young frontier boom town at the time, having been incorporated in 1817 and boosted by the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. The American Unitarian Association, the Unitarian national body, was also young, having been formed in 1825 by Christians who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity.\nRochester Unitarians operated in the early years without a settled minister and, except for a brief period, without a church building. Informal leadership was provided by Myron Holley, a former Commissioner of the Erie Canal and one of the founders of the Liberty Party, which advocated the abolition of slavery. An early church history gave Holley primary credit for the church's establishment.\n\nIn 1842 Rufus Ellis, at the age of twenty-two, agreed to come to Rochester to be the congregation's minister for a one-year period. Ellis lodged at the home of Dr. Matthew Brown, president of the congregation. Brown, who earlier was a member of the First Presbyterian Church, was one of Rochester's founders. Along with his brother, he had developed Brown's Race, the canal that delivered water power to Rochester's factory district. He also served as the first chairman of the board of supervisors of Monroe County, in which Rochester is located. Brown was an opponent of slavery; on the day in 1827 when slaves in New York State were emancipated, a delegation of African Americans visited Brown to thank him for his work to secure that legislation.\n\nFunds were raised under Ellis' leadership for a new church building that was dedicated in 1843. In a letter to his brother, Ellis noted that \"Forty-five of the pews are already sold or rented, and are occupied by 'correct' people.\" During Ellis' ministry the church approved a seal that contained an image of the Bible and the words \"our Creed\". Membership grew partly as a result of the Finney revival movement, which generated a wave of religious enthusiasm so strong in western New York that the area was sometimes called the \"burned-over district.\" Not all churchgoers were comfortable with the new atmosphere in their congregations, however, and some transferred to the less doctrinaire Unitarian Church.\n\nFrederick Holland, who became minister of First Unitarian in 1843, helped to stabilize the new congregation and increase its membership. He resigned in 1848 to assume leadership of the American Unitarian Association.\n\nDissention within the Quaker community eventually led some of its members to First Unitarian. When objections were raised to abolitionist activities, about 200 people withdrew from the regional Hicksite Quaker body in 1848 and formed an organization called the Congregational Friends. This group soon changed its name to the Friends of Human Progress and ceased to operate as a religious body, focusing instead on organizing annual meetings in Waterloo, New York that welcomed anyone interested in social reform, including \"Christians, Jews, Mahammedans, and Pagans\". In July 1848, a month after the split, four women associated with the Quaker dissidents met in Waterloo with anti-slavery activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and issued a call for a Women's Rights Convention to be held a short distance away in Seneca Falls, thereby launching the modern women's rights movement. Organized on short notice, it nonetheless drew about 300 people, largely from the immediate area.\n\nMomentum from this event led to the organization of another women's rights convention two weeks later at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, about west. The Rochester Convention took the significant step of electing a woman to preside, an idea that seemed so radical at the time that Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, two organizers of the Seneca Falls convention, opposed it and left the platform when Abigail Bush took the chair. She performed her duties without incident, and a precedent was established.\n\nThe convention at First Unitarian was organized mainly by a circle of activists in Rochester led by Amy and Isaac Post, who had resigned from their Hicksite Quaker congregation in the mid-1840s when opposition to the Post's abolitionist activities was raised in the Quaker congregation. Several members of this circle had participated in the Seneca Falls convention, including Mary Hallowell, Catherine Fish Stebbins, and Amy Post, who convened the meeting at First Unitarian. Some of the organizers of the Rochester convention were also associated with First Unitarian, including Hallowell, Stebbins and Post.\n\nA church history written in 1929 said, \"Our church was probably by strong majority abolitionist, an earnest group of Hicksite Quakers having attached themselves to the church as their own meeting grew inactive and faded out—the Anthonys, Hallowells, Willises, Posts, Fishes, etc.\"\n\nOf these families, the Anthonys were particularly significant for First Unitarian. Daniel Anthony was born a Quaker but married Lucy Reid, a Baptist, a violation of Quaker rules for which he was required to apologize to his congregation in central New York. The congregation later disowned him for allowing a dance school to operate in his house. Despite this patchy relationship, the Anthony children were raised as Quakers. After the Anthonys moved to Rochester in 1845, their homestead became the Sunday afternoon gathering place for progressive Quakers and other social reformers in the area. Both Daniel and Lucy Anthony attended the Women's Rights Convention at First Unitarian along with Mary, one of their daughters. Sarah Anthony Burtis, a relative, served as its acting secretary.\n\nSusan B. Anthony, another Anthony daughter, was teaching school in central New York at the time and had little involvement with any of these activities. When she returned to Rochester in 1849, she found her family attending worship services at First Unitarian. She joined her family there, making it her church home and her most significant source of local connections until her death more than 50 years later. Susan B. Anthony was listed as a member of First Unitarian in a church history written in 1881. Although she no longer attended Quaker meetings in Rochester after the 1848 split, she never relinquished her membership there. \n\nSusan B. Anthony is best known as an organizer and campaigner for women's rights, but she promoted other social reforms as well. In 1851 she helped sponsor an anti-slavery convention at First Unitarian. In 1852 she helped bring 500 women to Rochester to create the Women's State Temperance Society, of which she became the state agent. In 1853 she organized a Women's Rights Convention in Rochester with the assistance of the minister of First Unitarian. In 1857 she served as clerk of the Friends of Human Progress, the social reform group created by dissident Quakers and also became upstate New York agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society. She helped organize two more anti-slavery conventions in Rochester, one of which was so threatened by mob violence that she and her associates had to be escorted from the building by police for their own safety. Anthony's reform work, especially in the national campaign for women's right to vote, led her to spend most of her subsequent years on the road until advancing age required her to cut back on traveling and settle once again in Rochester.\n\nAfter Rev. Holland's departure from First Unitarian in 1848, the congregation entered a period of discord and short-term ministries that lasted until after the Civil War. A history of the church written in 1881 notes that some of its members during that period \"were persons of extreme and pronounced opinions, sharply opposed to each other on political and social questions,\" with slavery a key item of contention. There was also tension between the membership and some of the ministers of that period, not all of whom were as liberal as the congregation and one of whom went on to become a chaplain in the Confederate Army.\n\nA prominent minister of First Unitarian during this unsettled period was William Henry Channing, who served from 1853 to 1854. Nationally known as a supporter of social reform, he attended the first National Woman's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850 and served on the central committee that coordinated national conventions and other women's rights activities in the following years. In Rochester he worked closely with Susan B. Anthony, writing the call for the Women's Rights Convention she organized there in 1853 and playing a leading role in it. At the 1854 New York State Women's Rights Convention in Albany, which Anthony also organized, he, along with Ernestine Rose, presented petitions to the New York State Assembly that the movement had gathered. He wrote one of the two appeals that Anthony circulated as part of her women's suffrage work in New York state. \n\nChanning wrote a brief inspirational text that has become known as \"Channing's Symphony,\" which reads: \"To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich; to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open heart; to study hard; to think quietly, act frankly, talk gently, await occasions, hurry never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common – this is my symphony.\"\n\nChanning was important to the Anthony family. Mary Anthony said \"The liberal preaching of William Henry Channing in 1852 proved so satisfactory that it was not long before this was our accepted church home.\" Susan B. Anthony's sense of spirituality was influenced by Channing. Her friend and co-worker Elizabeth Cady Stanton said in 1898, \"She first found words to express her convictions in listening to Rev. William Henry Channing, whose teaching had a lasting spiritual influence upon her. To-day Miss Anthony is an agnostic. As to the nature of the Godhead and of the life beyond her horizon she does not profess to know anything. Every energy of her soul is centered upon the needs of this world. To her, work is worship ... Her belief is not orthodox, but it is religious.\" Anthony expressed the latter thought in these words: \"Work and worship are one with me. I can not imagine a God of the universe made happy by my getting down on my knees and calling him 'great.'\"\n\nChanning had little success with his factionalized congregation. Finding that he could attract larger audiences when he spoke outside the church than within it, he even considered making a fresh start by forming a movement separate from the church. Instead he left the city for other posts, serving as chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives during the Civil War.\n\nThe church declined afterwards, sometimes finding it difficult to pay its ministers, none of whom served for long. In 1859 the church's building was destroyed by fire. Rochester Unitarians were once again without either minister or building, a situation that was not resolved until after the Civil War.\"\n\nFrederick Holland, who had served as First Unitarian's minister in the 1840s, returned in 1865 as minister for an additional three years to help the congregation band together and construct a new church building, which was dedicated in 1866.\n\nThe ministry of Newton Mann, who served from 1870 to 1888, was a period of stability and growth. Mann was interested in science. He owned a telescope, served a term as president of the Rochester Academy of Science and was especially interested in evolution. Mann discussed the religious significance of Charles Darwin's recently published book on evolution in a sermon delivered in Cincinnati just before the Civil War which, according to the \"Rochester History\" journal, was the first such sermon in the U.S. In 1872 Mann initiated the first public controversy over evolution in Rochester by inviting a professor to give a series of lectures on that topic at First Unitarian, which were extensively reported. In a sermon in 1874 that was also reported in the press, Mann extended the concept of evolution into the realm of religion, asserting that evolution operates on the soul as people become increasingly aware of their spiritual environment and respond by developing their spiritual capabilities.\n\nMann supported the idea that the Bible has a human rather than a supernatural origin in \"A Rational View of the Bible\", written in 1879, saying that a rational approach to the Bible makes it more appealing by giving it \"a purely human quality which quite atones for all the mistakes it contains.\"\n\nIn 1870 Mann was invited to give an evening lecture at Temple B'rith Kodesh, Rochester's oldest and largest synagogue. This interfaith event, the first of its type in Rochester, contributed to a formal split between reformers and traditionalists within B'rith Kodesh and, according to \"The Jewish Community in Rochester\" by Stuart Rosenberg, \"shook the Jewish community in America and even had reverberations abroad.\" First Unitarian and B'rith Kodesh held a joint Thanksgiving service in 1871, and Rabbi Landsberg and Rev. Mann began the practice of exchanging pulpits, with each delivering the sermon for the other's congregation. A history of B'rith Kodesh describes the relationship between the two congregations during this period as \"extremely close\". In 1874 First Unitarian, B'rith Kodesh, and the First Universalist Church of Rochester began their continuing tradition of holding annual Union Thanksgiving services. In 1883 Mann helped Landsberg with part of his project to translate a new prayer book from Hebrew to English. Their translation of the song \"Yigdal\" has been included in the \"Union Hymnal\" of Reform Judaism and in hymnals of other denominations, including the \"Presbyterian Hymnal\" (1990). In 1884 Landsberg occupied the pulpit at First Unitarian for seven weeks while Mann was ill, attracting visitors from other denominations and, according to an early Rochester history, leading to speculation about the development of a universal church. The congregation of B'rith Kodesh used First Unitarian as a temporary home in 1909 after their building was destroyed by fire.\n\nIn 1872 Susan B. Anthony convinced the election inspectors in her ward in Rochester that the recently enacted Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed equal protection to all citizens, implicitly gave women the right to vote. When the news spread that Anthony and her three sisters had succeeded in registering to vote, other women in Rochester also registered. Of the two dozen or so whose names are known, at least three worshiped with Anthony at First Unitarian. Mrs. Mann, the wife of First Unitarian's minister, attempted to register in her ward but was refused. On election day, only fifteen of those who had registered, including Anthony, were actually permitted to vote, and then only because the election inspector in that ward, a long-time abolitionist, defied orders and allowed them to do so. Susan B. Anthony was arrested for voting and found guilty in a widely publicized trial that generated protests across the country.\n\nIn 1878 the annual meeting of the National Woman Suffrage Association, which was founded by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, convened at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester on the thirtieth anniversary of the first Women's Suffrage Convention in Seneca Falls.\n\nIn 1883 First Unitarian vacated its building to make way for the construction of a new post office. To replace it, the congregation purchased an existing church building from the Third Presbyterian Church of Rochester, which had moved to another location.\n\nWilliam Channing Gannett served as minister from 1889 to 1908. He came from a prominent Unitarian family, his father, Ezra Stiles Gannett, having written the constitution for the American Unitarian Association and served as its first secretary. William Channing Gannett himself had gained prominence as a leader of the successful movement within the denomination to end the practice of binding it by a formal creed, thereby opening its membership to non-Christians and even to non-theists. While pastor of a Unitarian church in Wisconsin before coming to Rochester, he had served as vice president of that state's women's suffrage association.\n\nMary Thorn Lewis Gannett, Rev. Gannett's wife, was \"very nearly his co-pastor,\" according to a church history. Coming from a Philadelphia Quaker background, she never relinquished her membership there, attending Quaker meetings whenever she visited Philadelphia. In Rochester, however, she was active in the First Unitarian Church and assisted in the formation of several community organizations.\n\nThe Gannetts focused their energy on social issues. Urging the congregation to be \"a seven-day instead of a one-day church\", Rev. Gannett encouraged it to become more involved with its downtown neighborhood of low-income immigrants.\n\nThe Gannetts accordingly initiated the Boys' Evening Home, which opened in 1890 in the church's parish house. Within three months its membership had grown to 95 even though some of its members had to leave because they had been sentenced to the State Industrial School. By 1893 the Home had a paid superintendent and was teaching classes in manual arts and drawing, and by 1898 its offerings had expanded to include such subjects as current events, zoology, literature and journalism. A small newspaper produced by the boys campaigned against penny slot machines, which were illegal gambling devices that could be found in candy stores. The neighborhood boys came largely from Polish and Russian Jewish immigrant families. When they reached their late teens, several members of the Boys' Evening Home formed the Judean Club in Rochester, which eventually became, according to Rosenberg's \"The Jewish Community in Rochester\", \"the most important cultural forum in the Jewish community of that time.\" At least four members of the Boys' Evening Home went on to become rabbis, one of whom credited Rev. Gannett with helping him choose that profession. Benjamin Goldstein, another member, became executive secretary of Temple B'rith Kodesh. Another former member, Meyer Jacobstein, was elected to the House of Representatives in Washington. Volunteers from B'rith Kodesh assisted the work of the Boys' Evening Home.\n\nFrom 1889 to 1908 Mary Gannett led First Unitarian's Women's Alliance, through which \"much of the church's activity was organized and executed\". About 1902 the Women's Alliance opened the Neighborhood Friendly for Girls, which provided classes in housekeeping, cooking, and sewing for girls in the church neighborhood.\n\nThe Gannetts sponsored the formation of the Unity Club in 1889, which was initiated by the Women's Alliance but was open to anyone in Rochester. With as many as a hundred members, it was divided into small classes under the tutelage of the Gannetts for the intensive study of such thinkers as Thoreau, Hawthorne, George Eliot, and the Fabians. The secretary of the Social Topics class, which examined social problems of the day, was Emma Sweet, a member of First Unitarian who was Susan B. Anthony's secretary.\n\nIn 1889 Mary Gannett established the Woman's Ethical Club, an interfaith organization that discussed the ethical aspects of social topics and campaigned for the admission of women to the University of Rochester. By the middle of the 1890s, the Ethical Club was attracting several hundred women to its meetings.\n\nOther members of First Unitarian engaged in social and political work during the Gannett years. Mary Anthony, sister of Susan B. Anthony, was active in many aspects of church life and was also deeply involved with the campaign for women's rights. In 1885 a group of women gathered at her home to establish the Women's Political Club, later known as the Political Equality Club. This group of about forty women achieved several breakthroughs, including the appointment of Rochester's first police matron, the placement of women doctors on the city's health staff, and the appointment of women to state institutional boards. Mary Anthony became president of the club in 1892 and served in that capacity for eleven years. Mary Gannett was a member of the club for over twenty years and held various offices.\n\nIn 1891 African American activist Hester C. Jeffrey moved to Rochester. She joined Rochester's AME Zion Church and helped organize women's clubs in the African American community. She also developed strong ties to First Unitarian, often attending services there and forming close friendships with Susan B. Anthony and Mary Gannett. She joined the Political Equality Club and created a suffrage club for African American women called the Susan B. Anthony Club. In 1895, while keeping her membership in AME Zion, she also became a member of First Unitarian.\n\nIn 1891, at the age of 71, Susan B. Anthony decided to limit her work that required travel and to settle into the house she shared with her sister Mary in Rochester. She resumed routine attendance at First Unitarian, formally signed its membership book, and deepened her friendships with Rev. William and Mary Gannett. Later that year she was invited to speak at the annual Union Thanksgiving service, which was held that year at First Unitarian. Its theme was \"The Unrest of the Times a Cause for Thankfulness\". Anthony spoke on the women's movement.\n\nIn 1893 Susan B. Anthony became the main force behind the formation of the Rochester branch of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, which worked for the educational and social advancement of women. Mary Gannett presided at the founding meeting and became the chair of its Legal Protection Committee, often becoming personally involved in protecting working women from dishonest employers. In 1911 she became president of the organization.\n\nIn 1893 Mary Anthony became corresponding secretary of the New York State Woman Suffrage Association. During the statewide drive that year for the right of women to vote in New York elections, the Anthony home was converted into campaign headquarters, with public offices in the parlor and other activities throughout the rest of the house. The campaign for women's suffrage in New York state eventually succeeded, becoming law in 1918 and providing momentum for the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment nationally in 1920.\n\nIn 1898 Susan B. Anthony called and chaired a meeting of 73 local women's societies to form the Rochester Council of Women, later known as the Rochester Federation of Women's Clubs. At its first meeting it renewed the campaign to elect a woman to the local school board even though women were still not allowed to vote. Mary Gannett, speaking for both the Council of Women and the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, played a major role in this campaign, which succeeded when both major parties were convinced to nominate the same woman. The Council of Women's consumer's committee, headed by Mrs. Max (Miriam) Landsberg of B'rith Kodesh and Mary Gannett, developed into the local chapter of the National Consumers League.\n\nThe long campaign to open the University of Rochester to women students involved several members of First Unitarian and organizations they had helped to create. The \"Democrat and Chronicle\", a local newspaper, writing several years after the event, said that next to Susan B. Anthony, Mary Gannett was chiefly responsible for the success of this campaign.\n\nSusan B. Anthony had formed a committee as early as 1879 to pressure the university to admit women, but without success. In 1889 the Women's Political Club renewed the campaign with a series of articles in local newspapers. During a meeting in 1891 at the Anthony home, university officials agreed to admit women if $200,000 could be raised to defray costs. The Women's Ethical Club initiated a fund-raising drive, and Susan B. Anthony and Rev. William Channing Gannett appealed for contributions at a public meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. This drive, however, was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1898 the university once again agreed to admit women if enough money could be raised and in 1899 lowered the necessary amount to $50,000. Most of that amount had already been raised, with Mary Gannett playing a leading role in that effort. Just after Susan B. Anthony returned home from a trip to Wyoming, however, she was informed the evening before the deadline that the drive was still $8000 short. With seemingly no possibility of raising additional money, and with renewed opposition among the university trustees, this drive seemed to have failed also. Determined to succeed, Susan B. Anthony, at the age of 81, rode the next morning in a carriage in a last-minute push to close the funding gap, which she accomplished by raising the entire amount from members of First Unitarian, including herself and her sister Mary.\n\nAlthough Susan B. Anthony worked on several local projects during this period, she remained deeply involved in national activities as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, working for an amendment to give women the right to vote. Generally known as the Anthony Amendment, it became the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. When the Anthony sisters traveled to Berlin in 1904 for the founding of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, Susan B. Anthony was declared its first member and Mary Anthony its second.\n\nEdwin A. Rumball, who served as minister from 1908 to 1915, continued the orientation toward social service that had been established in the Gannett years. In 1910 the church's parish house was expanded to provide better quarters for the Boys' Evening Home and was named Gannett House to honor Rev. Gannett, who had retired two years earlier.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1914 Rumball edited \"The Common Good,\" which \"emerged as Rochester's leading journal of progressive reform\" according to \"Affirming the Covenant: A History of Temple B'rith Kodesh\" by Peter Eisenstadt. The magazine began in 1907 as the house bulletin of the Baden Street Settlement House, which was founded by the Temple B'rith Kodesh Sisterhood to serve a neighborhood of mostly Jewish immigrants. When Rumball became editor in 1910, it expanded into a monthly journal devoted to social betterment of the city. Campaigning for such things as cleaner milk supplies and better conditions for factory workers, the publication was fatally weakened when a strike in the local clothing industry created an atmosphere of bitterness that led to a sharp decline in advertising revenues, which in turn led to the magazine's demise in 1914.\n\nRumball became the secretary of the Rochester City Club when it was formally organized in 1910 to provide programs for weekly luncheons at a downtown hotel. Membership grew to be in the hundreds, and the programs, which included such speakers as Jane Addams and Felix Frankfurter, often made headline news. Women, who had their own Women's City Club, were expected to listen from the balcony. Mary Gannett created a stir by inviting two African American men to sit with her in the balcony who later joined the club as regular members. She was also invited to accompany two speakers to the platform: anarchist Emma Goldman and African American scholar and activist W. E. B. Du Bois. She joined the club herself when membership was opened to women in 1937.\n\nFrank Doan became the minister of First Unitarian in 1922. Formerly a professor at the Meadville Unitarian seminary, he was one of the originators of the religious humanism movement within the denomination. He retired in 1925 at the age of 48 because of ill health and died two years later.\n\nDavid Rhys Williams was minister from 1928 to 1958. He served as president of the Unitarian Fellowship for Social Justice, advocated Soviet-American cooperation, promoted the American Civil Liberties Union and supported several national legal defense campaigns. In 1933 Williams became one of the 34 signers of the Humanist Manifesto, which, among other things, declared the universe to be self-existing and not created, rejected the duality between mind and body, and called for religion to be reformed in light of the scientific spirit.\n\nWilliams was an advocate of family planning and served on the executive committee of the local Birth Control League. The federal Comstock laws made it difficult at that time to be closely associated with any aspect of birth control. When Margaret Sanger, a national leader of the family planning movement, spoke at Temple B'rith Kodesh in 1932, she was arrested for answering a question from the audience about where birth control devices could be obtained. Williams preached a sermon on \"The Spiritual Significance of Voluntary Motherhood\" and invited Sanger to speak from the pulpit at First Unitarian a few weeks after she was arrested. A group of eight women, including Wilma Lord Perkins from First Unitarian, subsequently formed an organization that eventually became Planned Parenthood of Rochester/Syracuse. When the organization found it difficult to obtain office space elsewhere, First Unitarian provided them space in Gannett House from 1934 to 1937.\n\nIn 1933 a group of Quakers began meeting in the home of Mary Gannett for the purpose of reestablishing a formal presence in Rochester, where the last Quaker organization had disbanded in 1915. The new Quaker group began holding worship services the following year in Gannett House, First Unitarian's parish house. Gannett encouraged the new organization while continuing to devote her support activities to the First Unitarian Church of Rochester.\n\nIn 1940 \"Time\" magazine gave the church national publicity with an article about its ordination of James Ziglar Hanner as a Unitarian minister in an unusual ceremony that included two rabbis. Rabbi Phillip S. Bernstein of B'rith Kodesh gave Hanner his pastoral charge, basing it on the Hebrew text \"The Ethics of the Fathers\". The service closed with the singing of Yigdal, the hymn that had been translated from Hebrew to English in 1883 by Rabbi Landsberg of B'rith Kodesh and Rev. Mann of First Unitarian. Ziglar began his ministry in Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1953, during the McCarthy period, Williams' brother, Albert Rhys Williams, was accused by the House Un-American Activities Committee of having supported the Communist Party from 1919 to 1929. Rev. Williams supported his brother and criticized his attackers. Thirteen members of the congregation accused Williams of being soft on Communism and attempted to have him dismissed from the pulpit. When the issue was put to a congregational vote, the only votes against Williams were the thirteen who had made the accusation, all of whom subsequently left the church. A prominent member of First Unitarian who supported Williams during this controversy was Frank Gannett, founder of the Gannett newspaper chain, who had campaigned for the Republican nomination to run against Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential elections.\n\nIn 1957 several members of the congregation formed the Rochester Memorial Society, later called the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Greater Rochester, to encourage simple rather than ostentatious funeral services. By 1975 its membership had grown to over a thousand families. As of 2011, its mailing address continued to be the same as that of First Unitarian.\n\nIn 1958 Williams announced his intention to retire after 30 years of service. Three months later, while searching for his replacement, the church was informed that a project to build a downtown shopping mall would require the space occupied by their building, forcing the church to deal with two major issues at the same time.\n\nThe existing building had several deficiencies, and the church had been wrestling with problems of growth. Church committees had been investigating several alternatives including expanding the existing building, constructing a new church school, establishing daughter congregations, and purchasing the building that Temple B'rith Kodesh was vacating.\n\nThe church voted to sell their building to the Midtown Plaza developers in January 1959 with the understanding that they could continue to occupy it until July 1961. Construction activity nearby, however, soon weakened the building, forcing the congregation to move in September 1959. The church held Sunday services at the Dryden Theatre of the George Eastman House until a new building could be constructed.\n\nFirst Unitarian's previous building was architecturally significant, having been designed by Richard Upjohn, the first president of the American Institute of Architects. The church decided to replace it with a building designed \"by a leading 20th century architect, giving the community a notable example of contemporary architecture.\" The congregation voted to hire Louis Kahn in June 1959 to design their new building, which was completed in 1962.\n\nIn 1961 the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America merged to form the Unitarian Universalist Association. The possibility of merging Rochester's First Unitarian and First Universalist churches, which had conducted a joint church school in the 1950s and whose buildings had been only a block apart before the old Unitarian church was demolished two years earlier, was considered but not acted upon.\n\nWilliam Jenkins was minister from 1959 to 1963 and also served as president of the newly merged Unitarian Universalist Ministers' Association. Robert West was minister from 1963 until 1969, when he resigned to become president of the Unitarian Universalist Association.\n\nIn 1963 the church's Social Action Committee played the key role in creating Community Interests, Inc, an organization that provided minority families with housing loans. That organization was later absorbed by the Monroe County Housing Council.\n\nIn 1964 rapid growth in membership led the church to begin offering two Sunday worship services and church school sessions, with classes for older children relocated to the Harley School to ease crowding. Despite having originally informed Kahn that there would be no need to design the church to accommodate future enlargement, the church trustees decided in September 1964, less than two years after it was completed, to expand the building. Louis Kahn was hired once again as architect, and the addition was completed in May 1969.\n\nRichard Gilbert served as minister from 1970 until his retirement in 2002. Gilbert became one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II in 1973. During the 1970s Gilbert was a member of the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, a group of ministers and rabbis who helped women find safe abortions at a time when it was still illegal.\n\nIn 1980 Gilbert wrote \"The Prophetic Imperative: Unitarian Universalist Foundations for a New Social Gospel,\" a book used in seminars given by the denomination's Social Justice Empowerment Program. In 1983 Gilbert published the first of three volumes of \"Building Your Own Theology,\" a guidebook for examining and clarifying personal values and beliefs in a group setting. It became the most widely used adult education curriculum within the denomination.\n\nIn 1982 church member Joyce Gilbert called a meeting that led to the formation of the Unitarian Universalist Musicians Network. She and Ed Schell, First Unitarian's Minister of Music, served first as members of the organizing committee and then as presidents of the new organization. With a membership of several hundred, the organization played a major role in producing the denomination's new hymnals.\n\nIn 1988 the church volunteers began providing classroom support to Rochester city schools in a program called the UU/Schools Partnership.\n\nKaaren Anderson and Scott Tayler arrived as Parish Co-Ministers in 2004. In 2006 the church began its Greater Good Project, which asks members to cut their usual Holiday spending in half and contribute the other half to community projects. In its first year the congregation contributed $79,000, part of which was used to initiate the church's Honduras Project, which works to improve the quality of life in a small Honduras township.\n\nIn 2007 the church originated Wellspring, a program of spiritual deepening that has since been adopted by other Unitarian Universalist congregations.\n\nIn 2009 the church's Reproductive Rights Task Force began the process of establishing a talk line to offer \"support without judgment\" to women who have had abortions. Staffed by church volunteers and others in the community, the talk line, which is called Connect and Breathe, began operating in 2011. It operates in the eastern part of the U.S. in conjunction with a similar talk line that was already serving the western time zones.\n\nBecause of growth in membership, in 2010 the church began offering a Saturday worship service in addition to the two Sunday services.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2298065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298065", "title": "Nnewi", "text": "Nnewi\n\nNnewi is the one of the largest city in Anambra State in southeastern Nigeria. Nnewi as a metropolitan city encompasses two local government areas, Nnewi North, Nnewi South; Nnewi North is commonly referred to as Nnewi central, and comprises four autonomous quarters: Otolo, Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi. Nnewi North also includes Ichi, an autonomous neighbouring town. The first indigenous car manufacturing plant in Nigeria is located in the city while the first wholly made-in-Nigeria motorcycle, the 'NASENI M1' was manufactured in Nnewi.\n\n, Nnewi has an estimated population of 391,227 according to the Nigerian census. The city spans over in Anambra State. Nnewi Metropolitan Area and its satellite towns is home to nearly 2.5 million residents . Dimensionally, Nnewi has an edge over all other units, being recognized by the 1953 census figures as the largest inland town of all others in the Eastern states of Nigeria.\n\nIn Nnewi oral history and mythology, the 'ewi' () played a great role in saving the founders of Nnewi during wars. Throughout its history, Nnewi has used its military might to maintain its borders and because of this, the killing or eating of ewi in Nnewi is forbidden to the present day. Nnewi existed as an independent kingdom from the 15th century to 1904, when British colonial administration occupied the kingdom.\n\nNnewi kingdom was founded on four quarters (large villages), namely Otolo, Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi. Each village was divided into family units called 'umunna'. Each umunna had a first family known as the 'obi'.\n\nThese four quarters were these original names of the Sons of Edo: Otolo being the eldest and Nnewichi being the youngest of the sons Obi of Nnewi\n\nOriginally when the Igbos or Ibos settled in the present day Eastern Nigeria, they arrived with three leaders, two were spiritual leaders and the youngest of the three a hereditary King known as Obi a King by birthright. The first was the Eze Nri of Awka a Priest King, the second the Eze Aro of Arochukwu a King and the third the Obi of Nnewi a political and war ruler. The Obi of Onitsha was well qualified to become an Obi being disputably the first among the two sons of the Oba of Benin. The Onitsha people are visitors and later settlers in Igbo land. The Aros know this history (Nnewi being a relation and a leader among the Igbos) and this is part of the reason why there are no Aro settlements in Nnewi. The Obi of Nnewi Obi Okoli in1780s lost his throne when inside palace politics that hinged on tradition edged him out. Traditional royal law had it that the Crown Prince must perform the funeral rights of the late Obi before he can be crowned, Obi Okoli was absent and arrived home only after the late Obi Okoli 1st was buried. His Uncle (The late Obi Okoli the 1st younger brother) performed the funeral rights in his stead and took over as Igwe Nnewi he could not be enthroned as an Obi (which means the first son). The Obi Okoli royal lineage was forced into exile, they got refuge at Umune-Alam in Umudim, Nnewi where they still are to this day. The Obi Okoli family still bears the Ofor Nnewi till this day.\n\nEdo is the supreme deity of all the Alusi (Igbo: \"deity\") in the Anaedo country. The central shrine of this unifying Alusi is at Nkwo Nnewi, the central Market. There are four other deities in Nnewi: Ana, Ezemewi, Eze and Ele. Christianity was introduced by the Europeans in 1885 and many Nnewi people now practice Christianity.\n\nNnewi, Ichi and Oraifite made up the Anaedo state. Anaedo communities have common ancestries, beliefs and traditional value systems. Nnewi is a major trading and manufacturing center in Nigeria. Due to its high commercial activities, the city has attracted millions of migrants from other states and countries.\n\nThe Ofala Nnewi is a cultural festival held every year to celebrate the coronation of the Igwe of Nnewi. Afiaolu (New yam festival) and Ikwuaru are also among traditional festivals held annually in Nnewi.\nNnewi Kingdom is also known as \"Anaedo\" meaning the Land of Gold (The supreme deity and goddess of Nnewi).\n\nGeographically, Nnewi falls within the tropical rain forest region of Nigeria. Though it suffers from soil leaching and erosion which has reduced the soil in some areas to a porous sandy terrain, it remains an area of rich agricultural produce and the epicenter of business trade. The city is located east of the Niger River, and about 22 kilometers south east of Onitsha in Anambra State, Nigeria.\n\nThe traditional monarch of Nnewi is called the Igwe. The Igweship in Nnewi kingdom predates the arrival of Europeans, making it a unique monarchy in Igbo land. The Igbos are known for not having kings, hence the popular Igbo saying \"Igbo é nwě Eze\", meaning 'the Igbos have no king'. In other Igbo clans, the British colonial administrators created warrant chiefs who then assumed the office and title of Igwe and are elected to this day.\nIn Nnewi, the Igwe is the isi obi (head of the Obis) and hence the Igwe, which literally translates as the heavenly one or highness as he is the holder of the Ofo, the religious and political symbol. He is born and not made or elected, and the institution of inheritance is the traditional right and privilege.\nThe position is neither transferable nor negotiable. He is also an Obi. Obi is the title held by ruling chiefs; it is the equivalent of a duke in the nobility.\n\nThe present reigning monarch is His Royal Highness Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III; he is the longest serving monarch in Nigeria and he is currently the 20th monarch in the Nnofo Royal lineage. Igwe Kenneth Orizu III is the first class chief in Anambra state from Nnewi as well as the vice Chairman of the Anambra State House of Chiefs. \n\nThere are Obis in the four clans that make up Nnewi. The highest and the most senior obi is the Obi of Otolo, who is also the Igwe of Nnewi. Chief Afamefuna Obi, Obi Bennett Okafor and Obi George Onyekaba are the current obis of Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi, respectively. These three obis with Igwe Orizu, III as chairman constitute the Igwe-in-Council and they deliberate on the spiritual, traditional, and communal matters, in Nnewi.\n\nThere is also an active town union called the Nzuko-Ora Nnewi. It is a forum through which adult Nnewi indigenes (18 years or older) can contribute to the development of Nnewi. This union was set up to encourage and promote the establishment of structures and facilities that will promote and improve the quality of life of the residents of Nnewi.\n\nThe ancient legal system of Nnewi was not based upon a written law. It was purely a natural law, involving custom, tradition, and civil and criminal cases. The legal process in Nnewi passed through the labyrinth of extended family system. A report against an offender or a criminal in the first instance, had to be made to the head of his family at his ancestral home known as obi. The head of the family would invite elders and minor obis from his extended family unit to sit in judgment, while the complainant would also invite the elders and minor obis from his extended family side, if both of them were not from the same family. This obi would serve as the court of the first instance, depending, of course, on the nature of the offense or crime allegedly committed. The trial might end here, if both the complainant and the accused were satisfied with the judgment given, or they might take the case to the next senior obi of the same extended' family, in ascending order, until, probably, the matter got to the highest obi in the lineage. If the complainant was not satisfied at this point, he would appeal to the obi of the quarter and the leaders of his family could be summoned to defend their judgment.\n\nThrough this legal procedure, guilt or innocence could easily be established, as the decision was based purely on natural justice. Punishments for offenses and criminal acts were given in relation to their gravity. A man who was found guilty of a serious crime might have no option than to be sold into slavery or expelled from the community for life. He would not be killed because the killing of human beings was against the injunction of Edo Goddess.\nThe judicial system in Nnewi seems to have recognized three classes of cases, the minor offenses, the true criminal case, and the civil suits of debt, bride price and land. The breaking of by-laws was really an offence against some particular juju and as such was to be expiated by a sacrifice. It was, for example, forbidden to kill an \"eke\" snake, a type of python, or to eat \"ewi,\" rodent of rabbit family. It is probable these laws were never broken willingly and if broken by accident, the offender would automatically perform a sacrifice without any form of judicial trial being held.\nThe criminal code, with regard to serious crimes, appears to have been more developed in Nnewi than elsewhere in Igboland. There were seven main classes of offences, which were known as \"ori-obi,\" offenses against the obi, as their investigation was always carried out in the obi of the quarter.\n\nNnewi has contributed its fair share of key players in Nigerian politics. A. A. Nwafor Orizu; president of the Nigerian Senate in the First Republic and later, the Acting President before the first coup d’etat of 1966, M.C.K. Ajuluchukwu; a nationalist, anti-colonialist and first republic law-maker, Chief Z.C. Obi (Onunekwuluigbo Igbo); First republic politician, Sir Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu, OBE, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu (Ikemba Nnewi); former military Governor of defunct Eastern Nigeria and President of defunct Republic of Biafra, Comrade Dr. Edward Ikem Okeke; Deputy President of the PRP and Special Adviser to the President (Second Republic), Mr. F. C. Nwokedi; the first Nigerian Permanent Secretary, Dr. Dozie Ikedife (Ikenga Nnewi); former President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Professor A. B. C. Nwosu; Former Health Commissioner in East Central state and Anambra state, respectively, Dr. Chu Okongwu; Former Minister of Finance; Dr David Bennet Anagwu Ofomata;The first Indigenous Medical Director, Nigerian Railway Corporation, First CEO/Chairman Anambra Health Management Board & Chairman old Nnewi LGA;\n\nNnewi is also the ancestral home of prominent Nigerians including the esteemed individuals listed below. See (People).\n\nAgbo Edo, a forest land which belonged to Edo Nnewi deity, was cleared to make way for a new market called Nkwo Nnewi market. The development of this market propelled the fast development of the local economy.\n\nAs a fast developing city and a major industrial and commercial hub in Africa, Nnewi experiences voluminous financial activities, therefore hosts major banks, and other financial institutions. Industries are dotted around the city and adjoining towns. Palm oil, cosmetics, motor, and motorcycle spare parts, books, and stationery, textiles, electric cables, and so on are produced in commercial quantity in the area.\nIts main trading centers include Nkwo Nnewi market (the largest spare parts market in west Africa) and Nwafor market, Eke Amaobi market, Eke Ochie, Eke Ichi Market, Orie otube Market, etc.\n\nThe main occupation of Nnewi people is trading and farming, therefore they depend mainly on agriculture and commerce for their daily livelihood. Most Nnewian have mbubo (home gardens) and ubi (out-station gardens) where they usually cultivate their farm products. These crops when they are harvested are usually taken to the market for sale. Most of the prime cash crops include oil palm, raffia palm, groundnut, melon, cotton, cocoa, rubber, maize, et cetera. Food crops such as yam, cassava, cocoyam, breadfruit, and three-leaf yam are also produced in large quantities. The location of Nnewi within the tropical rainforest gives it the ecological basis for production of a wide range of tropical agriculture crops with widespread potential for industrial convention.\n\nNnewi is home to many major indigenous manufacturing industries including Ibeto Group of Companies, Cutix and ADswitch, Uru Industries Ltd, Omata Holdings Ltd, Cento Group of Companies, Coscharis of Companies Group, Innoson Group of Companies, Ebunso Nig. Ltd, John White Industries, Ejiamatu Group of Companies, Chicason Group, Louis Carter Group, etc.\nThe great majority of industrialists in the cluster of spare parts factories in Nnewi are also traders, and most of these traders are producing one or more of the products they specialize in marketing as traders (usually motor vehicle parts), and most began by distributing their products through their preexisting distribution networks. Nnewi is part of eastern Nigeria's industrial axis. The town has through culturally grounded institutions that act as sophisticated networks expanded to include an international dimension through trading relations with exporters from Asia. Over the last decade, the town of Nnewi has experienced relatively rapid industrialization. In excess of 20 medium-to-large-scale industries have been established across a variety of sectors. Since 1970, Nnewi residents have controlled approximately 80 to 90 percent of the motor-parts trade in Nigeria. Nkwo Nnewi Market is the major import and wholesale point for motor spare parts in Nigeria. The industrialists of Nnewi are adapting foreign technology to local needs, providing employment to thousands, and making available goods and services which are relevant actual needs of the Nigerian citizens. The first indigenous car manufacturing plant is located in the city, while the first wholly Made-in-Nigeria motorcycle was manufactured in Nnewi by the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI).\n\nNnewi is known for the vibrant auto industry in the city, the first Igbo man to own and drive a car was SIR LOUIS OJUKWU, the father of Dim CHUKWUEMEKA ODUMEGWU OJUKWU in 1912.\nBy 1940, Nnewi residents were at the center of an international trading network that dominated the supply of motor spare parts in Nigeria. The town subsequently became a center for commerce and industry, and has one of the largest automotive parts markets in Africa. Nnewi Township is an authentic \"manufacturing miracle.\" Small and medium-sized industries have set up in the town and are producing not only for the Nigeria markets but – albeit still to a limited extent – for markets abroad.\n\nIndustrialization of the town began around 1970 when Nnewi motor parts traders began marketing their own brand name products instead of the reproductions of \"original\" parts. There are a several auto and motorcycle spare parts dealers in Nnewi; the Nnewi Motorcycle spare parts market is well known throughout West Africa. There is also new auto plant, the first of its kind in Nigeria, owned by an Nnewi businessman, Innocent Chukwuma, Ono and a Chinese auto Company.\n\nNnewi, as a historical city, has many cultural events and places adorned with festivities and cultural monuments, including Edo Na Ezemewi shrine, Udoogwugwu shrine (Ichi), Kamanu shrine (Ichi), and many other shrines dotted across all sections of Nnewi city. Nnewi hosts many festivals, notably amongst them is the New yam (Afiolu, also known as Ifejioku festival) which all parts of the city participates and masquerades from all federating towns participates in. The festival attracts all sorts of activities and celebrations which Nnewi residents hold in the highest esteem.\n\nIn the average home of any Nnewi citizen, they usually keep kola nuts, garden egg and peanut butter in their refrigerator in case any stranger or visitor should visit their home. Every visitation to their home begins with the offering of the kola nuts to the visitor. The kola nut is indicating that the visitor is very much welcomed. The ritual of the offering of kola nut is inspired with the giving in prayers and blessing or lobby to the supreme God and other deities, for the protection of the visitor and the host. It seems to be a custom to the people of Nnewi in any of their traditional ceremonies.\n\nLocal artists thrive in this municipal rural communities. Works of art produced in the area comprises, carved doors, walking sticks of different designs, sculptures, flutes, wooden mortars and pestles, gongs, and the famous talking drums. Metal works and various types of productions are locally fashioned.\n\nThe Nnewi people, just like every other Igbo group, have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments: the udu, which is essentially designed from a clay jug; an ekwe, which is formed from a hollowed log; and the ogene, a hand bell designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar to the flute, ịgbà, and ịchàkà.\n\nTraditional marriage\nThere are three types of marriages in Nnewi as also practiced across the Nigerian society: the traditional marriage held in the house of the woman; the official wedding, held in a registry office and which allows only one wife; and the religious marriage.\n\nThe official marriage ceremony is called \"Igbankwu\", which is the Igbo word for the traditional marriage ceremony. Nnewi do not have an \"engagement\" ceremony. Rather, the Igbankwu is preceded by a series of events during which the potential bride's and groom's families engage each other to discuss the terms of the marriage. Perhaps this can be characterized as an engagement. Please note that Nigeria has 250 ethnic groups and each varies on marriage traditions. Further, within groups there can be even greater differentiation.\n\nThe traditional attire for the men is an overflowing jumper or a long-sleeved shirt worn over the gooji wrapper, which is tied around the waist, curving down to the ankles. This dress is matched with a cap and a walking stick, which aids as an instrument of support and defense. The traditional wear for the women is a blouse, worn over a loin cloth. This female attire goes with a head-tie ear rings and necklaces or traditional necklaces.\n\nIn Nnewi, the occasion of Iri-ji ohuu (new-yam eating) is a cultural festival because of its significance. Nnewi people celebrate their new yam festival usually at the end of August during which assortment of festivities mark the eating of new yam. These festivities normally include a lot of variety entertainment including performance of ceremonial rites by the Igwe (King), cultural dances by Igbo men, women and their children as well as a display of Igbo cultural activities in the form of contemporary shows, masquerade dance, and feasting at a grand scale on a wide variety of food making up the menu of the Igbos.\n\nThe first day of the festival the Igwe of Nnewi will officiate the Harvest thanksgiving ceremony at his palace where the yams are offered to gods and ancestors first before distributing them to the villagers. After the prayer of thanksgiving to god, The Igwe eats the first yam because it is believed that his position gives him the privilege of being intermediaries between Nnewi communities and the gods of the land. The rituals involved in the new yam eating are meant to express the community's appreciation to the gods for making the harvest of their yams possible. This therefore explains the three aspect of Igbo worldview, that they are pragmatic, religious and appreciative.\nThis ceremony has been celebrated for centuries and as has always presented the right conditions for all and sundry, family and friends to come together to demonstrate their commitment and solidarity to their local community. Due to this fact, the Igbos every where in the world do celebrate this event in a highly captivating manner in order to protect and celebrate the enriched cultural heritage of her people.\n\nReligion occupies a central place in the heart of Nnewi people. This counts for the huge churches and religious practices in the city. The people of Nnewi are 96% Christian, with small fractions of other faiths: 2% traditionalist, 0.2% Jews, 0.3% Muslims and 1.5% others.\nAmong the Christian community, the catholic and Anglican Communion shares a greater number of followers followed by other Pentecostal Christian groups.\nChristianity first came on the Southeastern part of Nigeria with the arrival of the Holy Ghost missionaries from Gabon to Onitsha under the leadership of Fr. Joseph Lutz late on Saturday December 5, 1885. Fr. Joseph Shanahan (The Apostle of Igboland) joined them in 1902 and when the mantle of leadership fell on him in 1905, history was set to record the evangelization of Roman Catholic Diocese of Nnewi. The stream of this evangelization was to flow through two main courses almost concurrently: one having Nnewi as its source and the other Ozubulu/Ihiala.\n\nThough individuals from various communities have come in contact with the faith as they traveled to Onitsha and other places for trade and in quest of western education, the actual planting of the seed of the gospel in Nnewi Diocese from the Catholic perspective sprang from the treks of Fr. Victor Duhaze to Ozubulu through Oguta (1906) and to Nnewi through Umuoji, Ojoto Mili Agu down to Odida Nnewichi in 1906.\n\nHowever, the Anglican Church was established in Nnewi from Obosi in 1893. But the seed of what is today Nnewi Diocese was sown in 1809. Requests were made by Odida. Community in Nnewichi inviting Fr. J. Shanahan. In the same year, some Ozubulu indigenes had registered the same requests for establishing a Church station at Ozubulu. Nnewi people are proud of there traditional Odinani as well as the new religion of Christianity.\n@(Note:The Church Missionary Society CMS under the leadership of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther and Reverend Henry Townsend arrived Onitsha on July 27, 1857)\n\nNnewi hosts a number of institutions and places of learning and healing, which include Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH) and a number of international agencies. The Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, is in the forefront of providing excellent health services to the nation. The hospital and its annexes since inception has provided specialized and comprehensive medical care to the immediate community and beyond. Its mandate also includes undergraduate and postgraduate medical and paramedical training as well as research. These services have grown from strength to strength through the years fueled by comprehensive annual plans approved by the Federal Government.\n\nThe ancient city of Nnewi hosts a number of traditional and formal learning institutions and places of learning, which include a Medical University: Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH)\nGovernment secondary schools: Okongwu Memorial Grammar School, Maria Regina Secondary School, Nnewi High School, Ichi Technical School (Ichi Community), Ichi Girls, Akoboezemu Community Secondary School, Anglican Girls Secondary School, Nnewi-Ichi Community Secondary School etc.\nPrivate schools: Summit International School, The Good Shepherd School, New Era School, Dr. Alutu's College of Excellence School ,christ the king, etc.\n\nCrime rates are low but civil disputes such as land ownership and family inheritance exist. In more recent times, the market square and banks have experienced well publicized and organized criminal attacks that have been allegedly linked to the local police. There are now open debates on reinstating a local vigilante crime fighting group called the Bakkassi Boys, who had a multi-year stint in Nnewi in the late 1990s when crime was on the increase. This group had a modus operandi that many considered barbaric but necessary – convicted thieves were killed in public by dismembering their body parts with a sharp machete and burning them alive. The activities of this group of men which had permission of the Governor of the state was seen by the Human rights activists and civil right movement as a violation of human rights and campaigned against their practices. Recently, Nnewi is relatively peaceful except for isolated occurrences of kidnapping of prominent local citizens for large ransoms.\n\nNnewi is well known as the home of several transport and logistics businesses since the end of the second world war.\nPhilip Odumegwu Ojukwu was one of Nigeria's first transporters and since then, many more transporters have emerged from Nnewi.\nSome of the Nnewi owned transport firms in Nigeria are:\n\nNnewi is also prominent in the hospitality industry with modern hotels that include;\n\n\nSeveral Nigerian fast food chains such as Mr Bigg's, Ever Fresh, Chicken De Royale are located in Nnewi. There are also a variety of local restaurants offering a variety of continental & Igbo dishes, indoor and outdoor catering services.\n\nNnewi is the ancestral home of prominent Nigerians, including:\n"}

Touted as an \"it girl\" of the late 1990s, Subkoff made her film debut in the thriller \"When the Bough Breaks\" (1994) opposite Martin Sheen, and has had supporting roles in \"As Good as It Gets\" (1997), \"The Last Days of Disco\" (1998), \"The Cell\" (2000), and \"The Notorious Bettie Page\" (2005). \n\nIn 2001, she co-founded an art collective-turned-fashion line, Imitation of Christ, which featured pieces hand-sewn solely from recycled vintage and thrift store clothing, and has since worked primarily as a conceptual artist. In 2015, she made her debut as a director with the horror film \"#Horror\" (2015), which was picked up for distribution by IFC Midnight.\n\nSubkoff was born in Westport, Connecticut. Her father was an antiques dealer who owned an antique store on 13th Street in Manhattan, and her mother was a schoolteacher in East Harlem. She grew up in what she described as a \"bohemian\" family, and attended boarding school at the Williston Northampton School in Massachusetts. After graduation, she attended the Parsons School of Design, but dropped out within a year of enrolling. She relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1991 to study acting, and took classes alongside Angelina Jolie and Keanu Reeves.\n\nSubkoff made her debut as an actress on television, appearing in \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" in 1994, followed by her feature film debut, a lead role in the 1994 crime thriller \"When the Bough Breaks\", opposite Martin Sheen and Ron Perlman. In 1996, she had a minor supporting part in the film \"Freeway\", and in the horror film \"Black Circle Boys\" (1997).\n\nThis was followed with lead roles in the drama \"All Over Me\" (1997), and the comedy \"Lover Girl\" (1997), co-starring Kristy Swanson. She had minor parts in \"As Good as It Gets\" (1997), Whit Stillman's \"The Last Days of Disco\" (1998), and an uncredited appearance in the 1999 teen sex comedy \"American Pie\". She also appeared in a supporting role in the sci-fi-horror film \"The Cell\" (2000) with Jennifer Lopez and Vincent D'Onofrio.\n\nIn 2017, Subkoff joined the group of women making the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, saying that the producer had sexually harassed her in the 1990s when she applied for a role in one of his films, and then had her blacklisted when she resisted. \"It became impossible for me to get work as an actress after this, so I then had to start a new career path and started Imitation of Christ\", she said.\n\nIn 2000, Subkoff began working on a project called Imitation of Christ with designer Matt Damhave, enlisting Chloë Sevigny as the project's creative director. Originally conceived as an art project, it has been described as \"DIY art collective misconstrued as a luxury fashion label.\" Every piece of clothing in the line was sewn by hand and recycled from vintage, thrift and Goodwill shops. Subkoff created pieces of wearable art with her fashion shows which garnered her a cult following. Models who wore the pieces for runway shows included actress Scarlett Johansson.\n\nReflecting on the line, Subkoff said: “We were talking about waste, throwing things away, and taking something that’s old and making it new again, putting the human hand back into a world that reeks of manufacturing. It felt very appropriate to do that in 2000.\"\n\nSubkoff and Damhave created four collections together, and the shows were described as \"guerilla-style, at least as much performance art as they were about [Subkoff's] refashioned, hand-sewn vintage clothes,\" with the project's earliest exhibitions taking place in a funeral parlor in the Manhattan's East Village. In 2003, she also collaborated with Bernhard Willhelm on a fashion collection inspired and authorized by Roberto Capucci.\n\nAfter Subkoff and Damhave parted ways, she continued to design pieces for the line through 2006. In 2007, Subkoff sold the label to Josh Sparks, the former chief executive of the Australian label Sass & Bide, for a reported $2 million. The following year, in 2008, the label went out of business. In 2012, Subkoff revived the label and began working on more pieces, shortening the brand name to simply \"Imitation.\"\n\nIn 2012, Subkoff created a ten-day art installation and continuous performance piece at the Carlton Festival of the Arts in São Paulo, Brazil. She also conceptualized a performance piece in a group show curated by Dimitri Antonitsis in Hydra, Greece.\n\nShe exhibited a three hour long installation at the Bortolami Gallery in New York City during the 2012 New York Fashion Week titled \"This is Not a Fashion Show,\" which featured a girl's choir in leotards performing “Carol of the Bells” (intimated as a \"slight to Yuletide consumerism\") and \"performers aging from 8 to 70 pruned and posing in front of antique mirrors lining the gallery walls.\" In explaining the idea behind the show, Subkoff said: \"We are a society that only sells commodities. We do not create anything unless it's to be bought and sold, so the idea of doing something where there isn't a commodity to sell, or what the commodity is to sell is very confusing, is extremely interesting to me.\"\n\nIn 2013, she collaborated with Milla Jovovich on a filmed installation in Venice, Italy titled \"Future/Perfect,\" which had Jovovich enclosed in a glass house, surrounded by boxes with consumer logos, artwork, and clothing.\n\nThough working predominantly in art, Subkoff also had a minor appearance in the film, including \"Tanner Hall\" (2009) and \"Abandoned\" (2010), with Brittany Murphy. Subkoff made her directorial debut in 2014 with the horror film \"#Horror\" (2015), which details a group of wealthy adolescent girls who experience a night of violence and terror after a social media game is tinged with cyberbullying. The film was screened out of competition at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, and was picked up for distribution by IFC Midnight, slated for a limited release in November 2015. According to Subkoff, she conceived the film after a conversation she'd had with her friend's daughter: \"[The idea] started because I asked my friend's daughter, \"What is horror, to you?\" This girl was cyberbullied very badly... Now, I was bullied badly as a kid, but I could always change schools. I could always go home. Now you can't…when bullying follows you home, and there's no escape and no end, to me, that's horror. And to so many girls, that's just life.\"\n\nSubkoff has been formerly romantically linked to Wes Anderson, and was formerly engaged to director Tom Hooper. In the fall of 2014, Subkoff married artist Urs Fischer. Subkoff gave birth to a daughter, Grace, in May 2016. In June 2016, it was reported that Subkoff and Fischer had filed for divorce. Subkoff resides in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 2009, Subkoff was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a benign brain tumor that required her to undergo a craniotomy in September 2009. Her symptoms had originally been diagnosed as TMJ by her doctor in 2003.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298087", "title": "Jim Leishman", "text": "Jim Leishman\n\nJim Leishman MBE (born 15 November 1953) is a Scottish Labour Party politician and former professional footballer who is currently Provost of Fife and an honorary director of Scottish Championship side Dunfermline Athletic.\n\nLeishman played for Dunfermline between 1970 and 1977 before being transferred to local rivals Cowdenbeath. When his playing career was cut short through injury he moved into coaching and then management with Kelty Hearts Junior Football Club, before becoming youth team coach and later reserve team coach at Dunfermline.\n\nHis most noticeable goal came in a 4-3 victory against Rangers. Jim still holds the record of being the last player to score a winning goal for the Pars at Ibrox. He likes to mention this fact as often as possible, much to the amusement of fans and friends.\n\nLeishman was appointed manager of the Pars, aged just 28, in 1982. The club were bottom of the Second Division, the third tier of Scottish football. The Pars finished third in 1984–85, missing out on promotion on the final day of the season. Leishman and assistant manager Gregor Abel then forged a side that would win successive promotions to the Scottish Premier Division, winning the Second Division in 1985–86 and finishing second to Greenock Morton in the 1986–87 First Division.\n\nAfter a hard-fought but ultimately unsuccessful campaign in the Premier Division in 1987/88, Leishman again led the club again to promotion from the First to Premier Division in the 1988/89 season. Throughout this time Leishman had helped rebuild the fanbase of the club. With publicity campaigns ranging from talks at local primary schools to national television appearances, Leishman arrested the downward spiral of the club since the early 1970s. The average gate of the club increased from approximately 1,500 in 1983/84 to 7,500 in season 1987/88.\n\nIn 1989/90 - Leishman's final year of his first tenure as the Pars' boss - the average home gate of Dunfermline Athletic Football Club was 13,500; the third largest in Scotland and the largest of all provincial clubs in the country. In this time he brought players such as George O'Boyle and record-signing Istvan Kozma to the club. His greatest success was keeping the club in the Premier Division at the end of the season. At the end of the campaign though, it was suggested that Leishman move from the dugout to the board-room with the club's suggestion that he take up the role of general manager. As a keen manager, he resisted the offer and left his post acrimoniously in July 1990. The move shocked the Pars' support and 4,000 fans marched on the club demanding his reinstatement as manager.\n\nFollowing his departure from the Pars in 1990, he had unproductive spells with Montrose and Inverness Thistle, as well as a spell in charge of Fife Junior outfit Rosyth Recreation. After this he enjoyed more than eight years with Livingston from 1995, latterly as coach. There he succeeded in taking Livi into the Scottish Premier League for the first time and the Europe by finishing 3rd following promotion. In August 2003 he returned to Dunfermline, ironically as General Manager. Following the sacking of Davie Hay with just three matches of the 2004–05 remaining, Leishman prevented relegation by steering the club to crucial wins over their main relegation rivals Dundee and Dundee United. Dunfermline had failed to win in their previous ten matches under Hay, but in Leishman's temporary care they hammered Dundee 5-0 and he soon took the job on a full-time basis.\n\nIn 2005–06 the Pars were once again tipped for relegation and almost lived up to that billing. They would have gone down had it not been, for his old club Livingston. An 11th-placed finish, although level on points with Falkirk and Dundee United, was enough to preserve their status. A particular low in this season came near the end of February when Celtic visited East End Park and left with a crushing 8-1 win. Exactly one month later Dunfermline faced Celtic in the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final and, despite an improved performance, they lost 3-0.\n\nLeishman is well known for his down to earth personality, excellent relationship with Dunfermline fans, and his \"aeroplane\" celebrations. At one point he enjoyed a reputation for his witty attempts at delivering his thoughts on football in verse. Leishman's strengths are considered to be his man-management skills and his renowned ability to motivate and install self-belief in his players.\n\nIn September 2006 another trademark of the man, his famous moustache, which he had had since the age of eighteen, was shaved off at a benefit dinner to mark the testimonial year of Dunfermline player Andy Tod. He was convinced to do so after people at the table he was sitting at, including current \"Pars\" players, put up £1000 for charity.\n\nPressure on Leishman increased steadily in 2006/07 after another poor start which brought just three wins in two months. On 26 October 2006, Leishman decided to return to his post as general manager, with former Hearts boss Craig Levein the initial favourite to take over. Leishman had himself recommended Levein and Livingston manager John Robertson as candidates but Levein moved to Dundee United following the sacking of Craig Brewster on 29 October 2006. Former Derry City boss Stephen Kenny took over in November 2006.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Leishman took up politics. He was elected as a Scottish Labour councillor for the Dunfermline Central ward of Fife Council at the 2012 election, and was subsequently appointed Provost of Fife.\n\nIn the Queen's Birthday Honours 2007, Leishman was appointed as a member of the Order of the British Empire for 'services to sport'. Leishman was further honoured in February 2008 by having a street in Dunfermline named after him.\n\n\n\nJim was awarded in 2010 a Great Scot Award and in the same year was given a Lifetime Achievement award from Radio Forth.\n\nAgain, in 2010 he received a fellow of the college award from Carnegie College at Dunfermline Abbey.\n\nIn 2012, Jim was elected as a councillor on the Friday then was made The Provost of Fife the following Thursday.\n\n"}

She is largely viewed sympathetically by historians as an unassuming and benevolent if overly doting woman who suffered much in her long life, who tried to influence the empire as well as she could, and who was not a party to her nephew's machinations, but whose failure, leading to the downfall of the Western Han Dynasty, was her overdependence on her clan (the Wangs).\n\nWang was born the second daughter of Wang Jin, the then-Minister of Justice and Lady Li. Although she was one of 12 children, only Wang and two brothers were born to Lady Li. Her parents tried to find Wang a husband; her suitors expired before their plans came to fruition. One suitor was the Prince of Dongping, but he died before the marriage. After this, Wang dedicated herself to studying books and playing the guqin. At age 18, she entered the palace as a palace woman, in the service of one of the imperial concubines.\n\nConsort Sima, the favorite consort of Crown Prince Liu Shi died from an illness. Crown Prince Shi was grief-stricken, became ill, and refused to see any of his concubines. His father, Emperor Xuan, suggested that Empress Xiaoxuan select palace women to attend the crown prince, as all the crown prince's concubines were so disagreeable. Wang was one of the palace women presented to the crown prince, among five others. The crown prince selected Wang, allegedly solely by the fact that she was seated closest to him at the time of selection. Three years after, Wang gave birth to a male child, Ao, whereas none of the crown prince's previous concubines had.\n\nIn 49 BC, Emperor Xuan died, and Crown Prince Shi became emperor. He made Consort Wang empress, and her son his heir apparent. Wang's father was created the Marquess of Yangping, a title later inherited by Empress Wang's brother Wang Feng (王鳳), who would later play a large role in government.\n\nEmperor Yuan was a relatively non-womanizing emperor, but he did have two favorite concubines in addition to Empress Wang—Consort Fu (傅昭儀) and Consort Feng Yuan (馮昭儀), each of whom bore him one son. Empress Wang apparently tried to maintain a cordial relationship with both, and she was largely successful, at least as far as Consort Feng was concerned. However, a struggle between Empress Wang and Consort Fu for their sons' heir status would erupt.\n\nAs Crown Prince Ao grew older, Emperor Yuan became increasingly unhappy with his fitness as imperial heir and impressed with Consort Fu's son, Prince Liu Kang of Shanyang (山陽王劉康). Several incidents led to this situation. One happened in 35 BC, when Emperor Yuan's youngest brother Prince Liu Jing of Zhongshan (中山王劉竟) died, Emperor Yuan became angry when he felt that the teenage Crown Prince Ao was insufficiently grieving—particularly because Princes Ao and Jing were of similar age and grew up together as playmates—and showing insufficient respect to Prince Jing. Prince Ao's head of household Shi Dan (史丹), a relative of Emperor Yuan's grandmother and a senior official respected by Emperor Yuan, managed to convince Emperor Yuan that Crown Prince Ao was trying to stop Emperor Yuan himself from overgrieving, but the seed of dissatisfaction was sown.\n\nAs the princes further grew, several things further led to an endearment between Emperor Yuan and Prince Kang. They shared affection and skills in music—particularly in the playing of drums. Prince Kang also showed high intelligence and diligence, while Crown Prince Ao was known for drinking and womanizing. When Emperor Yuan grew ill circa 35 BC—an illness that he would not recover from—Consort Fu and Prince Kang were often summoned to his sickbed to attend to him, while Empress Wang and Crown Prince Ao rarely were. In his illness, apparently encouraged by Consort Fu, Emperor Yuan reconsidered whether he should make Prince Kang his heir instead. Only the intercession of Shi Dan led Emperor Yuan to cease those thoughts. When Emperor Yuan died in 33 BC, Crown Prince Ao ascended the throne (as Emperor Cheng).\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Yuan and the accession of Emperor Cheng, Empress Wang became empress dowager. Prince Kang, as was customary with imperial princes, was sent to govern his principality—now at Dingtao (定陶). Despite the near-coup by Consort Fu and Prince Kang, however, Empress Wang and Emperor Cheng did not bear grudges, and, against the advice of officials who were concerned that Prince Kang would become the subject of conspiracies, Emperor Cheng often summoned Prince Kang to the capital Chang'an for extended visits.\n\nAs empress dowager, Empress Dowager Wang was kind but overly doting on her son and her brothers. Emperor Cheng was very trusting of his uncles (Empress Dowager Wang's brothers) and put them in important roles in government. In addition to Wang Feng, who had inherited his father's title as the Marquess of Yangping, six of Empress Dowager Wang's brothers were created marquesses, in violation of the rule laid by Emperor Gao, the founder of the dynasty, who had decreed that only those who had contributed to the empire in substantial ways could be made marquesses. Several (Wang Feng, Wang Shang (王商), and Wang Gen (王根)), in addition to Empress Dowager Wang's cousin Wang Yin (王音), served successively as the supreme commander of the armed forces and were in effective control of the administration. After Wang Gen, Empress Dowager Wang's nephew Wang Mang served in the same role.\n\n\nThe Wangs, while not corrupt in general and apparently genuinely trying to help the emperor, were largely concerned with aggrandizing their power and not with the best interests of the empire when selecting officials for various posts, and this led to a continued deterioration in the administration of Emperor Cheng, who at times considered modifying this power structure but always failed to do so. For example, in 24 BC, under the suggestion of an official Wang Zhang (王章, unrelated to the Wang clan), Emperor Cheng considered replacing Wang Feng with highly regarded official Feng Yewang (馮野王), the brother of his father's concubine Consort Feng. When Wang Feng realized this, Empress Dowager Wang became saddened, and in response Emperor Cheng executed Wang Zhang and relieved Feng Yewang of his post without any allegation of wrongdoing.\n\nEmperor Cheng was a womanizer with many favorites. His first favorite was Empress Xu (created 31 BC), from the clan of his murdered grandmother, the first wife of Emperor Xuan. He also favored Consort Ban. Neither Empress Xu nor Consort Ban bore him a child, however, and concerned with having a grandson to be heir, Empress Dowager Wang openly encouraged Emperor Cheng to take on more and more concubines, but that did not result in the birth of an heir. Circa 19 BC, however, when Emperor Cheng was visiting the Princess of Yang'a (陽阿公主), he became enamored with her dancing girl Zhao Feiyan (趙飛燕) and her sister Zhao Hede (趙合德) and made them his concubines, and they became favored over Empress Xu and Consort Ban. In 18 BC, the Zhao sisters falsely accused Empress Xu and Consort Ban of practicing magic; Empress Xu was deposed, and while Consort Ban was able to successfully plead her case, she did not wish to return to the same environment and instead became a lady in waiting for Empress Dowager Wang. Emperor Cheng wanted to then create Zhao Feiyan as empress, but Empress Dowager Wang complained about her low birth and prior occupation as a dancing girl; she finally capitulated to her son's wishes in 16 BC, but she was never pleased with the Zhao sisters. Neither the Zhaos nor another later favorite of Emperor Cheng's, Consort Li, bore him a son either, however.\n\nIn 9 BC, still heirless, Emperor Cheng appeared to come to the resolution of making either his younger brother Prince Liu Xing of Zhongshan (中山王劉興) or his nephew Prince Liu Xin of Dingtao (定陶王劉欣, Prince Kang's son) his heir. Emperor Cheng became convinced that Prince Xin was more capable, and at the same time, Prince Xin's grandmother Consort Fu was endearing herself to the Zhaos and Wang Gen with lavish gifts, and so the Zhaos and Wang Gen both praised Prince Xin as well. Emperor Cheng made Prince Xin crown prince in 8 BC.\n\nEmperor Cheng died suddenly in 7 BC, apparently from a stroke (although historians also report the possibility of an overdosage of aphrodisiacs given to him by Consort Zhao Hede). Immediately there were many rumors that he had in fact had concubines who bore him sons, but that those sons and their mothers were murdered by Consort Zhao Hede (out of jealousy) and possibly Emperor Cheng himself. Grieving her husband and apparently fearful of reprisal, Consort Zhao Hede killed herself. Crown Prince Xin ascended the throne as Emperor Ai.\n\nA report by officials commissioned by Empress Dowager Wang concluded in 6 BC that Emperor Cheng did have two sons—one born to Consort Cao in 12 BC and one born to Consort Xu (a relative of the deposed Empress Xu) in 11 BC. However, both of the sons were murdered in their infancy by orders of Consort Zhao Hede, with at least tacit agreement from Emperor Cheng, who was enamored with her; Consort Cao was forced to commit suicide after her son was murdered. In response, apparently at the urging of Empress Dowager Wang, Emperor Ai stripped the Zhaos' relatives of their marquess titles and exiled them; only Empress Zhao Feiyan was spared (for the time being).\n\nWhen Emperor Ai ascended the throne, Empress Dowager Wang received the title that she is later most known for—Grand Empress Dowager Wang. Initially, out of respect for her, Emperor Ai, while consolidating his own power base, left the Wangs, including Wang Mang, largely in the posts that they had been in.\n\nHowever, the influences of Emperor Ai's grandmother Consort Fu would soon be shown. Consort Fu was not content with her title of Princess Dowager of Dingtao; rather, she also wanted to be empress dowager. Grand Empress Dowager Wang was willing to let her have the title, and it was by her edicts that Consort Fu was also given the title Grand Empress Dowager (with a difference—Fu had the unique title, not again to be used, of \"Ditaitaihou\" (帝太太后) compared with Wang's regular title of \"Taihuangtaihou\" (太皇太后)); in an analogous manner, Emperor Ai's mother Consort Ding was also given the title of Empress Dowager (\"Ditaihou\", 帝太后; cf. Zhao Feiyan's title of \"Huangtaihou\", 皇太后)).\n\nConsort Fu was not content with titles, however, but did everything she could to control her grandson's administration. Part of her agenda involved the removal of the Wangs from government. Grand Empress Dowager Wang had no desire to contend with Fu, however, and voluntarily ordered members of the Wang family to resign and turn over power to the Fus and the Dings. Her humility and willingness to yield greatly impressed the people and the officials in government, and as the incompetence of Emperor Ai became apparent, the people and the officials—who were largely against the Wangs during the reign of Emperor Cheng—all clamored for the return of the Wangs. This yearning came partly from a thorough miscarriage of justice perpetrated by Consort Fu in 6 BC when she, still bearing a grudge from her struggles with her former romantic rival Consort Feng Yuan (who by that time was Princess Dowager of Zhongshan and the grandmother of Prince Liu Jizi of Zhongshan), falsely accused Consort Feng of practicing magic, forced her to commit suicide, and executed and exiled a large number of her family. In response, in 2 BC, Emperor Ai recalled Wang Mang to the capital to attend to Grand Empress Dowager Wang.\n\nIn 1 BC, Emperor Ai died without an heir, and this left the imperial household in immediate turmoil—during which Grand Empress Dowager Wang would play an important role.\n\nWhen Emperor Ai died, his male favorite (commonly believed to be homosexual lover) Dong Xian was in command of the armed forces and was the most powerful official in government, and there was great uncertainty what was going to happen next. It was at this time Grand Empress Dowager Wang would play the most crucial role in her life. She decided to immediately proceed to the imperial palace and seize the imperial seal and summon Dong. Her move caught Dong by surprise, and he was paralyzed and unable to act. Grand Empress Dowager Wang summoned Wang Mang to the palace as well and transferred the command of the imperial guard from Dong to Wang Mang. Dong, fearful of what was going to happen next, killed himself.\n\nWang Mang immediately moved to remove all obstacles to power, but at the same time maintaining an appearance of faithfulness to the Han Dynasty. With Grand Empress Dowager Wang's assent, he removed the Fus and Dings from government, and without her knowledge, he dishonored Consort Fu's and Consort Ding's graves. Grand Empress Dowager Wang then summoned her remaining stepgrandson Prince Jizi to the throne, as Emperor Ping.\n\nDuring Emperor Ping's reign, Wang Mang served as regent, with Grand Empress Dowager Wang's support. When in her presence, he did everything he could to convince her of his faithfulness to the Han Dynasty and also flattered her, but at the same time continued to purge the government of potential enemies and getting his associates to use propaganda to create an aura of holiness about him. In 1, convinced of her nephew's faithfulness, Grand Empress Dowager Wang created him Duke of Anhan (安漢公, literally \"Duke who made Han secure\")—even though previously there had not been a single duke created in Han history. In 2, when selecting an empress for Emperor Ping, Grand Empress Dowager Wang initially ordered that girls from the Wang clan be excluded, but Wang Mang immediately mobilized a mass of petitioners to surround the palace, urging her to make his daughter empress. Grand Empress Dowager Wang relented and selected Wang Mang's daughter to be Emperor Ping's empress, and she was created as such in 4.\n\nIn 3, another major event happened that greatly increased Wang Mang's power. Wang Mang's son Wang Yu (王宇), dissatisfied with his father's dictatorial rule, conspired with Emperor Ping's maternal uncles, the Weis, against Wang Mang. When their conspiracy was discovered, Wang Mang had not only Wang Yu and the Weis (except Consort Wei) put to death, but also used this opportunity to accuse many actual or potential political enemies as being part of the conspiracy and to execute or exile them. This included even his own uncle Wang Li (王立), whom he forced to commit suicide by forging an edict from Grand Empress Dowager Wang, from whom he hid the truth (and instead told that Wang Li had died of an illness). Wang Mang made Grand Empress Dowager Wang feel as if she were in control of the situation, however, by arranging for her to periodically survey the areas around the capital Chang'an to reward people with money and goods and to visit orphans and widows. He also ingratiated himself to her by building an impressive temple for her husband Emperor Yuan.\n\nIn 5, Wang Mang poisoned Emperor Ping after becoming concerned that Emperor Ping was going to take vengeance for Wang Mang's executing of his uncles. He also began to lift the façade of faithfulness to the Han in Grand Empress Dowager Wang's presence, effectively forcing her to grant him the title of acting emperor (假皇帝) against her wishes and to approve his selection of Liu Ying, a great-great-grandson of Emperor Xuan, as the new emperor (as Emperor Ruzi). In 8, Wang Mang usurped the throne and established the Xin Dynasty. When he demanded that Grand Empress Dowager Wang turn over the imperial seal, she initially refused, but eventually relented.\n\nWang Mang initially wanted to abolish Grand Empress Dowager Wang's title and give her a new title, but she immediately indicated that she was greatly offended at his suggestion. In response, he kept her title but gave her an additional one—\"Wenmu\" (文母), implying that she was a cofounder of his dynasty. She never acknowledged the new dynasty, and when Wang Mang changed the calendar and the holidays as well as the uniform of the imperial household attendants, she ordered her ladies in waiting to continue to observe the Han calendar and wear the Han uniforms. He tried to attend to her needs earnestly to try to please her, but his attempts failed.\n\nCirca 12, Wang Mang destroyed Emperor Yuan's temple and built another one, intended for Grand Empress Dowager Wang after her death. When she found out that her husband's temple had been destroyed, she was greatly saddened and cursed Wang Mang. She died in the spring of 13, and Wang Mang buried her, as was customary, in the same tomb as Emperor Yuan, but dug a trench between her and Emperor Yuan.\n\nHouse of Liu\nHouse of Wang\n\n"}

{"id": "2298105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298105", "title": "Filipinos", "text": "Filipinos\n\nFilipinos () are the people who are native to or citizens of the country of the Philippines. Filipinos come from various Austronesian ethnolinguistic groups. Currently, there are more than 185 ethnolinguistic groups, each with its own language, identity, culture and history. The number of individual languages listed for Philippines is 185. Of these, 183 are living and 2 are extinct. Of the living languages, 175 are indigenous and 8 are non-indigenous. Furthermore, , 39 are institutional, 67 are developing, 38 are vigorous, 28 are endangered, and 11 are dying.\n\nThe name \"Filipino\" was derived from the term \"las Islas Filipinas\" (\"the Philippine Islands\"), the name given to the archipelago in 1543 by the Spanish explorer and Dominican priest Ruy López de Villalobos, in honour of Philip II of Spain (Spanish: \"Felipe II\").\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period the term \"Filipino\" was used for the Spaniards born in the archipelago, especially when it was necessary to distinguish the \"indios\" of the Philippines from the \"indios\" of the Spanish colonies in the New World. In the latter half of the 19th century, an educated class of \"indios\" arose whose writings are credited with building Philippine nationalism. These writings are also credited with transforming the term \"Filipino\" from a reference to Spaniards born in the Philippines to refer to everyone born in the Philippines. The usage of the word \"Filipino\" to refer to the natives in many Spanish-era works and writings, such as in the \"Relación de las Islas Filipinas\" (1604) of Pedro Chirino, in which he wrote chapters entitled \"Of the civilities, terms of courtesy, and good breeding among the Filipinos\" (Chapter XVI), \"Of the Letters of the Filipinos\" (Chapter XVII), \"Concerning the false heathen religion, idolatries, and superstitions of the Filipinos\" (Chapter XXI), \"Of marriages, dowries, and divorces among the Filipinos\" (Chapter XXX), while also using the term \"Filipino\" to refer unequivocally to the non-Spaniard natives of the archipelago like in the following sentence:\n\nIn the \"Crónicas\" (1738) of Juan Francisco de San Antonio, the author devoted a chapter to \"The Letters, languages and politeness of the Philippinos\", while Francisco Antolín argued in 1789 that \"the ancient wealth of the Philippinos is much like that which the Igorots have at present\". These examples prompted the historian William Henry Scott to conclude that during the Spanish colonial period:\n\nWhile the Philippine-born Spaniards during the 19th century began to be called \"españoles filipinos\", logically contracted to just \"Filipino\", to distinguish them from the Spaniards born in Spain, they themselves resented the term, preferring to identify themselves as \"hijos del país\" (sons of the country).\n\nHistorian Ambeth Ocampo has suggested that the first documented use of the word \"Filipino\" to refer to Indios was the Spanish-language poem \"A la juventud filipina\", published in 1879 by José Rizal. Writer and publisher Nick Joaquin has asserted that Luis Rodríguez Varela was the first to describe himself as \"Filipino\" in print. Apolinario Mabini (1896) used the term \"Filipino\" to refer to all inhabitants of the Philippines. Father Jose Burgos earlier called all natives of the archipelago as \"Filipinos\".\n\nThe lack of the letter \"\"F\"\" in the pre-1987 Tagalog alphabet (Abakada) caused the letter \"\"P\"\" to be substituted for \"\"F\"\", though the alphabets and/or writing scripts of some non-Tagalog ethnic groups included the letter \"F\". Upon official adoption of the modern, 28-letter Filipino alphabet in 1987, the term \"Filipino\" was preferred over \"Pilipino\". Locally, some still use \"Pilipino\" to refer to the people and \"Filipino\" to refer to the language, but in international use \"Filipino\" is the usual form for both.\n\nA number of Filipinos refer to themselves colloquially as \"\"Pinoy\"\" (feminine: \"\"Pinay\"\"), which is a slang word formed by taking the last four letters of \"\"Filipino\"\" and adding the diminutive suffix \"\"-y\"\".\n\nOther collective endonyms for the Filipino people include: \"\"Patria Adorada\"\" (Spanish for \"Beloved Fatherland\") as popularized by Jose Rizal through his poem \"Mi último adiós\", \"\"Bayang Pilipino\"\" (Tagalog: \"Filipino nation\") or the more poetic \"\"Sambayanáng Pilipino\"\" (a formal term in Tagalog meaning \"one/entire Filipino nation\").\n\nIn 2010, a metatarsal from \"Callao Man\", discovered in 2007, was dated through uranium-series dating as being 67,000 years old.\n\nPrior to that, the earliest human remains found in the Philippines were thought to be the fossilized fragments of a skull and jawbone, discovered in the 1960s by Dr. Robert B. Fox, an anthropologist from the National Museum. Anthropologists who examined these remains agreed that they belonged to modern human beings. These include the \"Homo sapiens\", as distinguished from the mid-Pleistocene \"Homo erectus\" species.\n\nThe \"Tabon Man\" fossils are considered to have come from a third group of inhabitants, who worked the cave between 22,000 and 20,000 BCE. An earlier cave level lies so far below the level containing cooking fire assemblages that it must represent Upper Pleistocene dates like 45 or 50 thousand years ago. Researchers say this indicates that the human remains were pre-Mongoloid, from about 40,000 years ago. Mongoloid is the term which anthropologists applied to the ethnic group which migrated to Southeast Asia during the Holocene period and evolved into the Austronesian people (associated with the Haplogroup O1 (Y-DNA) genetic marker), a group of Malayo-Polynesian-speaking people including those from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Malagasy, the non-Chinese Taiwan Aboriginals or Rhea's.\n\nFluctuations in ancient shorelines between 150,000 BC and 17,000 BC connected the Malay Archipelago region with Maritime Southeast Asia and the Philippines. This may have enabled ancient migrations into the Philippines from Maritime Southeast Asia approximately 50,000 BC to 13,000 BC.\n\nA January 2009 study of language phylogenies by R. D. Gray at the University of California, Los Angeles published in the journal \"Science\", suggests that the population expansion of Austronesian peoples was triggered by rising sea levels of the Sunda shelf at the end of the last ice age. This was a two-pronged expansion, which moved north through the Philippines and into Taiwan, while a second expansion prong spread east along the New Guinea coast and into Oceania and Polynesia.\n\nThe Negritos are likely descendants of the indigenous populations of the Sunda landmass and New Guinea, pre-dating the Mongoloid peoples who later entered Southeast Asia. Multiple studies also show that Negritos from Southeast Asia to New Guinea share a closer cranial affinity with Australo-Melanesians. They were the ancestors of such tribes of the Philippines as the Aeta, Agta, Ayta, Ati, Dumagat and other similar groups. Today they comprise just 0.03% of the total Philippine population.\n\nThe majority of present-day Filipinos are a product of the long process of evolution and movement of people. After the mass migrations through land bridges, migrations continued by boat during the maritime era of South East Asia. The ancient races became homogenized into the Malayo-Polynesians which colonized the majority of the Philippine, Malaysian and Indonesian archipelagos.\n\nSince at least the 3rd century, various ethnic groups established several communities. These were formed by the assimilation of various native Philippine kingdoms. South Asian and East Asian people together with the people of the Indonesian archipelago and the Malay Peninsula, traded with Filipinos and introduced Hinduism and Buddhism to the native tribes of the Philippines. Most of these people stayed in the Philippines where they were slowly absorbed into local societies.\n\nMany of the \"barangay\" (tribal municipalities) were, to a varying extent, under the \"de jure\" jurisprudence of one of several neighboring empires, among them the Malay Srivijaya, Javanese Majapahit, Brunei, Malacca, Indian Chola, Champa and Khmer empires, although \"de facto\" had established their own independent system of rule. Trading links with Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Cambodia, Malay Peninsula, Indochina, China, Japan, India and Arabia. A thalassocracy had thus emerged based on international trade.\n\nEven scattered barangays, through the development of inter-island and international trade, became more culturally homogeneous by the 4th century. Hindu-Buddhist culture and religion flourished among the noblemen in this era.\n\nIn the period between the 7th to the beginning of the 15th centuries, numerous prosperous centers of trade had emerged, including the Kingdom of Namayan which flourished alongside Manila Bay, Cebu, Iloilo, Butuan, the Kingdom of Sanfotsi situated in Pangasinan, the Kingdom of Luzon now known as Pampanga which specialized in trade with most of what is now known as Southeast Asia, and with China, Japan and the Kingdom of Ryukyu in Okinawa.\n\nFrom the 9th century onwards, a large number of Arab traders from the Middle East settled in the Malay Archipelago and intermarried with the local Malay, Bruneian, Malaysian, Indonesian, and Luzon and Visayas indigenous populations.\n\nIn the years leading up to 1000 AD, there were already several maritime societies existing in the islands but there was no unifying political state encompassing the entire Philippine archipelago. Instead, the region was dotted by numerous semi-autonomous \"barangays\" (settlements ranging is size from villages to city-states) under the sovereignty of competing thalassocracies ruled by datus, rajahs or sultans or by upland agricultural societies ruled by \"petty plutocrats\". States such as the Wangdoms of Ma-i and Pangasinan, Kingdom of Maynila, Namayan, the Kingdom of Tondo, the Kedatuans of Madja-as, and Dapitan, the Rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu and the sultanates of Maguindanao, Lanao and Sulu existed alongside the highland societies of the Ifugao and Mangyan. Some of these regions were part of the Malayan empires of Srivijaya, Majapahit and Brunei.\n\nDatu – The Tagalog \"maginoo\", the Kapampangan \"ginu\", and the Visayan \"tumao\" were the nobility social class among various cultures of the pre-colonial Philippines. Among the Visayans, the tumao were further distinguished from the immediate royal families, or a ruling class.\n\nTimawa – The timawa class were free commoners of Luzon and the Visayas who could own their own land and who did not have to pay a regular tribute to a maginoo, though they would, from time to time, be obliged to work on a datu's land and help in community projects and events. They were free to change their allegiance to another datu if they married into another community or if they decided to move.\n\nMaharlika – Members of the Tagalog warrior class known as maharlika had the same rights and responsibilities as the timawa, but in times of war they were bound to serve their datu in battle. They had to arm themselves at their own expense, but they did get to keep the loot they took. Although they were partly related to the nobility, the maharlikas were technically less free than the timawas because they could not leave a datu's service without first hosting a large public feast and paying the datu between 6 and 18 pesos in gold – a large sum in those days.\n\nAlipin – Commonly described as \"servant\" or \"slave\". However, this is inaccurate. The concept of the alipin relied on a complex system of obligation and repayment through labor in ancient Philippine society, rather than on the actual purchase of a person as in Western and Islamic slavery. Members of the alipin class who owned their own houses were more accurately equivalent to medieval European serfs and commoners.\n\nBy the 15th century, Arab and Indian missionaries and traders from Malaysia and Indonesia brought Islam to the Philippines, where it both replaced and was practiced together with indigenous religions. Before that, indigenous tribes of the Philippines practiced a mixture of Animism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Native villages, called \"barangays\" were populated by locals called Timawa (Middle Class/ freemen) and Alipin (servants & slaves). They were ruled by Rajahs, Datus and Sultans, a class called Maginoo (royals) and defended by the Maharlika (Lesser nobles, royal warriors and aristocrats). These Royals and Nobles are descended from native Filipinos with varying degrees of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, which is evident in today's DNA analysis among South East Asian Royals. This tradition continued among the Spanish and Portuguese traders who also intermarried with the local populations.\n\n The Philippines was settled by the Spanish. The arrival of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan () in 1521 began a period of European colonization. During the period of Spanish colonialism the Philippines was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which was governed and controlled from Mexico City. Early Spanish settlers were mostly explorers, soldiers, government officials and religious missionaries born in Spain and Mexico. Most Spaniards who settled were of Andalusian ancestry but there were also Catalan, Moorish and Basque settlers. The \"Peninsulares\" (governors born in Spain), mostly of Castilian ancestry, settled in the islands to govern their territory. Most settlers married the daughters of rajahs, datus and sultans to reinforce the colonization of the islands. The \"Ginoo\" and \"Maharlika\" castes (royals and nobles) in the Philippines prior to the arrival of the Spanish formed the privileged \"Principalía\" (nobility) during the Spanish period.\n\nThe arrival of the Spaniards to the Philippines attracted new waves of immigrants from China, and maritime trade flourished during the Spanish period. The Spanish recruited thousands of Chinese migrant workers called \"sangleys\" to build the colonial infrastructure in the islands. Many Chinese immigrants converted to Christianity, intermarried with the locals, and adopted Hispanized names and customs and became assimilated, although the children of unions between Filipinos and Chinese that became assimilated continued to be designated in official records as \"mestizos de sangley\". The Chinese mestizos were largely confined to the Binondo area until the 19th century. However, they eventually spread all over the islands, and became traders, landowners, and moneylenders.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population.\nBritish forces occupied Manila between 1762 and 1764 as a part of the Seven Years' War. However, the only part of the Philippines which the British held was the Spanish colonial capital of Manila and the principal naval port of Cavite, both of which are located on Manila Bay. The war was ended by the Treaty of Paris (1763). At the end of the war the treaty signatories were not aware that Manila had been taken by the British and was being administered as a British colony. Consequently, no specific provision was made for the Philippines. Instead they fell under the general provision that all other lands not otherwise provided for be returned to the Spanish Empire. Many Indian Sepoy troops and their British captains mutinied and were left in Manila and some parts of the Ilocos and Cagayan. The ones in Manila settled at Cainta, Rizal and the ones in the north settled in Isabela. Most were assimilated into the local population.\n\nA total of 110 Manila-Acapulco galleons set sail between 1565 and 1815, during the Philippines trade with Mexico. Until 1593, three or more ships would set sail annually from each port bringing with them the riches of the archipelago to Spain. European \"criollos\", \"mestizos\" and Portuguese, French and Mexican descent from the Americas, mostly from Latin America came in contact with the Filipinos. Japanese, Indian and Cambodian Christians who fled from religious persecutions and killing fields also settled in the Philippines during the 17th until the 19th centuries.\n\nWith the inauguration of the Suez Canal in 1867, Spain opened the Philippines for international trade. European investors such as British, Dutch, German, Portuguese, Russian, Italian and French were among those who settled in the islands as business increased. More Spaniards arrived during the next century. Many of these European migrants intermarried with local \"mestizos\" and assimilated with the indigenous population.\n\nAfter the defeat of Spain during the Spanish–American War in 1898, Filipino general, Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence on 12 June while General Wesley Merritt became the first American governor of the Philippines. On 10 December 1898, the Treaty of Paris formally ended the war, with Spain ceding the Philippines and other colonies to the United States in exchange for $20 million.\n\nAngeles, Manila, and Olongapo. In addition, numerous Filipino men enlisted in the US Navy and made careers in it, often settling with their families in the United States. Some of their second- or third-generation families returned to the country.\n\nFollowing its independence, the Philippines has seen both small and large-scale immigration into the country, mostly involving American, European, Chinese, and Japanese peoples. After World War II, South Asians continued to migrate into the islands, most of which assimilated and avoided the local social stigma instilled by the early Spaniards against them by keeping a low profile and/or by trying to pass as Spanish mestizos. This was also true for the Arab and Chinese immigrants, many of whom are also post WWII arrivals. More recent migrations into the country by Koreans, Persians, Brazilians, and other Southeast Asians have contributed to the enrichment of the country's ethnic landscape, language and culture. Centuries of migration, diaspora, assimilation, and cultural diversity made most Filipinos accepting of interracial marriage and multiculturalism.\n\nPhilippine nationality law is currently based upon the principle of \"jus sanguinis\" and, therefore, descent from a parent who is a citizen of the Republic of the Philippines is the primary method of acquiring national citizenship. Birth in the Philippines to foreign parents does not in itself confer Philippine citizenship, although RA9139, the Administrative Naturalization Law of 2000, does provide a path for administrative naturalization of certain aliens born in the Philippines. Filipinos of mixed ethnic origins are still referred to today as \"mestizos\". However, in common parlance, mestizos are only used to refer to Filipinos mixed with Spanish or any other European ancestry. Filipinos mixed with any other foreign ethnicities are named depending on the non-Filipino part.\n\nPeople classified as 'blancos' (whites) were the insulares or \"Filipinos\" (a person born in the Philippines of pure Spanish descent), peninsulares (a person born in Spain of pure Spanish descent), Español mestizos (a person born in the Philippines of mixed Austronesian and Spanish ancestry), and tornatrás (a person born in the Philippines of mixed Austronesian, Chinese and Spanish ancestry). Manila was racially segregated, with blancos living in the walled city of Intramuros, un-Christianized sangleys in Parían, Christianized sangleys and mestizos de sangley in Binondo, and the rest of the 7,000 islands for the indios, with the exception of Cebu and several other Spanish posts. Only mestizos de sangley were allowed to enter Intramuros to work for whites (including mestizos de español) as servants and various occupations needed for the colony.\nIndio were native Austronesians, but as a legal classification, Indio were those who embraced Roman Catholicism and Austronesians who lived in proximity to the Spanish colonies.\nPeople who lived outside Manila, Cebu and the major Spanish posts were classified as such: 'Naturales' were Catholic Austronesians of the lowland and coastal towns. The un-Catholic Negritos and Austronesians who lived in the towns were classified as 'salvajes' (savages) or 'infieles' (the unfaithful). 'Remontados' (Spanish for 'situated in the mountains') and 'tulisanes' (bandits) were indigenous Austronesians and Negritos who refused to live in towns and took to the hills, all of whom were considered to live outside the social order as Catholicism was a driving force in Spanish colonials everyday life, as well as determining social class in the colony.\nPeople of pure Spanish descent living in the Philippines who were born in Spanish America were classified as 'americanos'. Mestizos and africanos born in Spanish America living in the Philippines kept their legal classification as such, and usually came as indentured servants to the 'americanos'. The Philippine-born children of 'americanos' were classified as 'Ins'. The Philippine-born children of mestizos and Africanos from Spanish America were classified based on patrilineal descent.\n\nThe term \"negrito\" was coined by the Spaniards based on their appearance. The word 'negrito' would be misinterpreted and used by future European scholars as an ethnoracial term in and of itself. Both Christianized negritos who lived in the colony and un-Christianized negritos who lived in tribes outside the colony were classified as 'negritos'. Christianized negritos who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for indios.\n\nA person of mixed Negrito and Austronesian ancestry were classified based on patrilineal descent; the father's ancestry determined a child's legal classification. If the father was 'negrito' and the mother was 'India' (Austronesian), the child was classified as 'negrito'. If the father was 'indio' and the mother was 'negrita', the child was classified as 'indio'. Persons of Negrito descent were viewed as being outside the social order as they usually lived in tribes outside the colony and resisted conversion to Christianity.\n\nThis legal system of racial classification based on patrilineal descent had no parallel anywhere in the Spanish-ruled colonies in the Americas. In general, a son born of a sangley male and an indio or mestizo de sangley female was classified as mestizo de sangley; all subsequent male descendants were mestizos de sangley regardless of whether they married an India or a mestiza de sangley. A daughter born in such a manner, however, acquired the legal classification of her husband, i.e., she became an India if she married an indio but remained a mestiza de sangley if she married a mestizo de sangley or a sangley. In this way, a chino mestizo male descendant of a paternal sangley ancestor never lost his legal status as a mestizo de sangley no matter how little percentage of Chinese blood he had in his veins or how many generations had passed since his first Chinese ancestor; he was thus a mestizo de sangley in perpetuity.\n\nHowever, a 'mestiza de sangley' who married a blanco ('Filipino', 'mestizo de español', 'peninsular', or 'americano') kept her status as 'mestiza de sangley'. But her children were classified as tornatrás. An 'India' who married a blanco also kept her status as India, but her children were classified as mestizo de español.\n\nA mestiza de español who married another blanco would keep her status as mestiza, but her status will never change from mestiza de español if she married a mestizo de español, Filipino, or peninsular.\n\nOn the contrast, a mestizo (de sangley or español) man's status stayed the same regardless of whom he married. If a mestizo (de sangley or español) married a filipina (woman of pure Spanish descent), she would lose her status as a 'filipina' and would acquire the legal status of her husband and become a mestiza de español or sangley. If a 'filipina' married an 'indio', her legal status would change to 'India', despite being of pure Spanish descent.\n\nThe social stratification system based on class that continues to this day in the country had its beginnings in the Spanish colonial area with a discriminating caste system.\n\nThe Spanish colonizers reserved the term \"Filipino\" to refer to Spaniards born in the Philippines. The use of the term was later extended to include Spanish and Chinese mestizos, or those born of mixed Chinese-indio or Spanish-indio descent. Late in the 19th century, José Rizal popularized the use of the term \"Filipino\" to refer to all those born in the Philippines, including the Indios.<ref name=\"Owen 2014 https://books.google.com/books?id=cippAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA275&dq=indio+filipino+rizal 275\"></ref> When ordered to sign the notification of his death sentence, which described him as a Chinese mestizo, Rizal refused. He went to his death saying that he was \"indio puro\".\n\nThe Spanish caste system based on race was abolished after the Philippines' independence from Spain in 1898, and the word 'Filipino' expanded to include the entire population of the Philippines regardless of racial ancestry.\n\nThe aboriginal settlers of the Philippines were primarily Negrito groups, an Australoid group and a left-over from the first human migration out of Africa to Australia. Negritos comprise a small minority of the nation's overall population. They, along with Papuans, Melanesians and Australian Aboriginals also hold sizable Denisovan admixture in their genomes. The majority population of Filipinos, however, are Austronesians, a linguistic and genetic group whose historical ties lay in maritime Southeast Asia, but through ancient migrations can be found as indigenous peoples stretching as far east as the Pacific islands and as far west as Madagascar off the coast of Africa. The current predominant theory on Austronesian expansion holds that Austronesians settled the Philippine islands through successive southward and eastward seaborne migrations from the Neolithic Austronesian populations of Taiwan.\n\nThe most frequently occurring Y-DNA haplogroups among modern Filipinos are haplogroup O1a-M119, which has been found with maximal frequency among the indigenous peoples of Nias, the Mentawai Islands, and Taiwan, and Haplogroup O2-M122, which is found with high frequency in many populations of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Polynesia. In particular, the type of O2-M122 that is found frequently in Filipinos, O-P164(xM134), is also found frequently in other Austronesian populations. Trejaut \"et al.\" 2014 found O2a2b-P164(xO2a2b1-M134) in 26/146 = 17.8% of a pool of samples of Filipinos (4/8 = 50% Mindanao, 7/31 = 22.6% Visayas, 10/55 = 18.2% South Luzon, 1/6 = 17% North Luzon, 2/22 = 9.1% unknown Philippines, 2/24 = 8.3% Ivatan). The distributions of other subclades of O2-M122 in the Philippines were sporadic, but it may be noted that O2a1c-JST002611 was observed in 6/24 = 25% of a sample of Ivatan and 1/31 = 3.2% of a sample from the Visayas. A total of 45/146 = 30.8% of the sampled Filipinos were found to belong to Haplogroup O2-M122. Haplogroup O1a-M119 is also commonly found among Filipinos (25/146 = 17.1% O1a-M119(xO1a1a-P203, O1a2-M50), 20/146 = 13.7% O1a1a-P203, 17/146 = 11.6% O1a2-M50, 62/146 = 42.5% O1a-M119 total according to Trejaut \"et al.\" 2014) and is shared with other Austronesian-speaking populations, especially those in Taiwan, western Indonesia, and Madagascar.\n\nAfter the 16th century, the colonial period saw the influx of genetic influence from other populations. This is evidenced by the presence of a small percentage of the Y-DNA Haplogroup R1b present among the population of the Philippines. DNA studies vary as to how small these lineages are. A year 2001 study conducted by Stanford University Asia-Pacific Research Center stated that only 3.6% of the Philippine population had European Y-DNA.\n\nAccording to another genetic study done by the University of California (San Francisco), they discovered that a more \"modest\" amount of European genetic ancestry was found among some respondents who self-identified as Filipinos.\n\nNational Geographic's \"The Genographic Project\", Relaunched in 2012 as Geno 2.0, based on a massive genetic testing of 80,000 Filipinos by the National Geographic in 2008–2009 found that the Philippines’ autosomal genepool is overwhelmingly East Eurasian, consisting of 53% Southeast Asian and Oceanian genes, and 36% East Asian genes, with 5% Southern European genes, 3% South Asian genes, and 2% Native American genes.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population.\nAround 28-30% of Filipinos have Chinese ancestry. \nAlso, according to a Y-DNA compilation by the DNA company \"Applied Biosystems\", they calcuated an estimated 1% frequency of the South Asian Y-DNA \"H1a\" in the Philippines. Thus translating to about 1,011,864 Filipinos having full or partial Indian descent, not including other Filipinos in the Philippines and Filipinos abroad whose DNA (Y-DNA) have not been analyzed.\n\nDental morphology provides clues to prehistoric migration patterns of the Philippines, with Sinodont dental patterns occurring in East Asia, Central Asia, North Asia, and the Americas. Sundadont patterns occur in mainland and maritime Southeast Asia as well as Oceania. Filipinos exhibit Sundadonty, and are regarded as having a more generalised dental morphology and having a longer ancestry than its offspring, Sinodonty.\n\nPublished in 1849, The \"Catalogo Alfabetico de Apellidos\" contains 141 pages of surnames with both Spanish and indigenous roots.\n\nAuthored by Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua and Domingo Abella, the catalog was created in response to the Decree of 21 November 1849, which gave every Filipino a surname from the book. The decree in the Philippines was created to fulfill a Spanish colonial decree that sought to address colonial subjects who did not have a last name. This explains why a number of Filipinos without Spanish blood share the same surnames as many Spaniards today.\n\nIn relation to this, a population survey conducted by German ethnographer Fedor Jagor concluded that 1/3rd of Luzon which holds half of the Philippines' population had varying degrees of Spanish and Latin American ancestry.\n\nAustronesian languages have been spoken in the Philippines for thousands of years. According to a 2014 study by Mark Donohue of the Australian National University and Tim Denham of Monash University, there is no linguistic evidence for an orderly north-to-south dispersal of the Austronesian languages from Taiwan through the Philippines and into Island Southeast Asia (ISEA). Many adopted words from Sanskrit and Tamil were incorporated during the strong wave of Indian (Hindu-Buddhist) cultural influence starting from the 5th century BC, in common with its Southeast Asian neighbors. Chinese languages were also commonly spoken among the traders of the archipelago. However, with the advent of Islam, Arabic and Persian soon came to supplant Sanskrit and Tamil as holy languages. Starting in the second half of the 16th century, Spanish was the official language of the country for the more than three centuries that the islands were governed through Mexico City on behalf of the Spanish Empire. The variant of Spanish used was Mexican-Spanish, which also included much vocabulary of Nahuatl (Aztec) origin. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Spanish was the preferred language among \"Ilustrados\" and educated Filipinos in general. Significant agreements exist, however, on the extent Spanish use beyond that. It has been argued that the Philippines were less hispanized than Canaries and America, with Spanish only being adopted by the ruling class involved in civil and judicial administration and culture. Spanish was the language of only approximately ten percent of the Philippine population when Spanish rule ended in 1898. As a lingua franca or creole language of Filipinos, major languages of the country like Chavacano, Cebuano, Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Bicolano, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano assimilated many different words and expressions from Castilian Spanish.\n\nChavacano is the only Spanish-based creole language in Asia. Its vocabulary is 90 percent Spanish, and the remaining 10 percent is a mixture of predominantly Portuguese, Nahuatl (Mexican Indian), Hiligaynon, and some English. Chavacano is considered by the Instituto Cervantes to be a Spanish-based language.\n\nIn sharp contrast, another view is that the ratio of the population which spoke Spanish as their \"mother tongue\" in the last decade of Spanish rule was 10% or 14%. An additional 60% is said to have spoken Spanish as a second language until World War II, but this is also disputed as to whether this percentage spoke \"kitchen Spanish\", which was used as marketplace lingua compared to those who were actual fluent Spanish speakers.\n\nIn 1863 a Spanish decree introduced universal education, creating free public schooling in Spanish, yet it was never implemented, even before the advent of American annexation. It was also the language of the Philippine Revolution, and the 1899 Malolos Constitution proclaimed it as the \"official language\" of the First Philippine Republic, albeit a temporary official language. Spanish continued to be the predominant lingua franca used in the islands by the elite class before and during the American colonial regime. Following the American occupation of the Philippines and the imposition of English, the overall use of Spanish declined gradually, especially after the 1940s.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, there are about 180 languages spoken in the Philippines. The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines imposed the Filipino language. as the national language and designates it, along with English, as one of the official languages. Regional languages are designated as auxiliary official languages. The constitution also provides that Spanish and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.\n\nOther Philippine languages in the country with at least 1,000,000 native and indigenous speakers include Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Waray, Central Bikol, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Chavacano (Spanish-based creole), Albay Bikol, Maranao, Maguindanao, Kinaray-a, Tausug, Surigaonon, Masbateño, Aklanon and Ibanag. The 28-letter modern Filipino alphabet, adopted in 1987, is the official writing system. Also, language of each ethnicity has also their own writing scripts, which are no longer used and set of alphabets.\n\n, over 90% of the population were Christians, with over 80% professing Roman Catholicism. The latter was introduced by the Spanish beginning in 1565, and during their 300-year colonization of the islands, they managed to convert a vast majority of Filipinos, resulting in the Philippines becoming the largest Catholic country in Asia. There are also large groups of Protestant denominations, which either grew or were founded following the disestablishment of the Catholic Church during the American Colonial period. The Iglesia ni Cristo is currently the single largest indigenous church, followed by United Church of Christ in the Philippines. The Iglesia Filipina Independiente (also known as the Aglipayan Church) was an earlier development, and is a national church directly resulting from the 1898 Philippine Revolution. Other Christian groups such as the Victory Church, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Mormonism, Orthodoxy, and the Jehovah's Witnesses have a visible presence in the country.\n\nThe second largest religion in the country is Islam, estimated to account for 6% to 11% of the population. Islam in the Philippines is mostly concentrated in southwestern Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago which, though part of the Philippines, are very close to the neighboring Islamic countries of Malaysia and Indonesia. The Muslims call themselves \"Moros\", a Spanish word that refers to the Moors (albeit the two groups have little cultural connection other than Islam).\n\nHistorically, ancient Filipinos held animistic beliefs that were influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism, which were brought by traders from neighbouring Asian states. Indigenous groups like the Aeta are Animists, while Igorot and Lumad tribes still observe traditional religious practises, often alongside Christianity or Islam.\n\n, religious groups together constituting less than five percent of the population included Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Seventh-day Adventists, United Church of Christ, United Methodists, the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, Assemblies of God, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Philippine (Southern) Baptists; and the following domestically established churches: Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ), Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayan), Members Church of God International, and The Kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Name Above Every Name. In addition, there are Lumad, who are indigenous peoples of various animistic and syncretic religions.\n\nThere are currently more than 10 million Filipinos who live overseas. Filipinos form a minority ethnic group in the Americas, Europe, Oceania, the Middle East, and other regions of the world.\n\nThere are an estimated four million Americans of Filipino ancestry in the United States, and more than 300,000 American citizens in the Philippines. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, immigrants from the Philippines made up the second largest group after Mexico that sought family reunification.\n\nFilipinos make up over a third of the entire population of the Northern Marianas Islands, an American territory in the North Pacific Ocean, and a large proportion of the populations of Guam, Palau, the British Indian Ocean Territory, and Sabah.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298109", "title": "Afewerk Tekle", "text": "Afewerk Tekle\n\nAfewerk Tekle (22 October 1932 – 10 April 2012) was an Ethiopian artist, particularly known for his paintings on African and Christian themes as well as his stained glass.\n\nBorn in Ankober, in Shewa Province, to Feleketch Yamatawork and Tekle Mamo, Afewerk grew up under the Italian occupation during the Second World War. Following the war in 1947, Afewerk decided that he wanted to help rebuild Ethiopia and elected to travel to England to study mining engineering. Before departing, Afewerk, together with other students leaving to study overseas, was addressed by Emperor Haile Selassie. Afewerk recalls being told \"you must work hard, and when you come back do not tell us what tall buildings you saw in Europe, or what wide streets they have, but make sure you return equipped with the skills and the mindset to rebuild Ethiopia\".\n\nAfewerk had already shown talent as an artist as a child, decorating several walls in his home town. Whilst at boarding school in England, this talent was recognised and encouraged by his teachers. As a result, Afewerk was persuaded to switch from engineering and enroll in Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. He then went on to the Slade School of Art where he studied painting, sculpture and architecture.\n\nReturning to Ethiopia as a university graduate, Afewerk could have accepted an assigned ministerial post, but instead decided to spend time travelling around the provinces of Ethiopia to get more experience of his native country and culture, which he reflected in his paintings. In 1954, he held his first one-man show in Addis Ababa, at Municipality Hall, that gave him the funds to travel around Europe for two years where he learnt how to design and construct stained glass windows. He also made a special study on Ethiopian illustrated manuscripts in the British Library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris and the Vatican Library.\n\nBack in Ethiopia, Afewerk opened a studio in the National Library of Ethiopia. His growing recognition lead to government commissions for murals and mosaics in St George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa, and several of his designs were used on the national stamps. He was also commissioned to produce sculptures of famous Ethiopians, although only the monumental statue of Ras Makonnen in Harrar was completed. Most notably, in 1958 he designed the stained glass windows in the Africa Hall of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa. The three windows cover an area of 150 square meters, and represent the sorrow of Africa's past, the struggle of the present, and hope for Africa's future.\n\nIn 1961, Afewerk held a major retrospective in Addis Ababa, which led to his painting \"Maskal Flower\" being shown at international exhibitions in Russia, the United States and Senegal. Increasing funds allowed Afewerk to travel around the continent of Africa. With much of Africa still emerging from colonialism, Afewerk became fired with black emancipation and the struggles for independence. This is reflected in his paintings of this time, with titles like \"Backbones of African Civilization\" and \"African Unity\".\n\nIn 1964, he became the first laureate of the Haile Selassie I Prize for Fine Arts. As his reputation spread abroad, Afewerk was invited to put on an exhibition in Moscow following which he toured the Soviet Union giving lectures. The American government responded with an invitation for one man exhibitions in Washington D.C. and New York and a similar lecture tour of American universities. Additional international exhibitions followed in Senegal, Turkey, Zaire, the United Arab Republic, Bulgaria, Munich, Kenya and Algeria.\n\nThrough much of the 1970s, Afewerk was engaged in producing murals and mosaics for many public and religious buildings around Ethiopia, including the mural \"Last Judgement\" in the Adigrat Cathedral in Adigrat, Tigray. In 1977, his painting \"Unity Triptych\" won the gold medal in the Algiers International Festival.\n\nThe early 1980s saw a second major exhibition in Moscow and an exhibition in Bonn. In 1981, his painting \"Self-portrait\" was the first work by an African artist to enter the permanent collection of the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy.\n\nIn 1997, he exhibited at the Biennale of Aquitaine, France, winning first prize in the international competition. He was also nominated as the Laureate of the Biennale which gave him membership of the French International Academy of Arts.\n\nAfewerk Tekle had membership of the Russian Academy of Arts, so he became the first African member in 1983.\n\nAfewerk Tekle died on 10 April 2012 from severe stomach ulcer complications after receiving treatment at a private hospital in Addis Ababa and was buried at the cemetery of the Holy Trinity Cathedral at Addis Ababa. Afewerk's death received wide media coverage in the country, with a national committee-arranged funeral.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298113", "title": "Starwood Amphitheatre", "text": "Starwood Amphitheatre\n\nThe Starwood Amphitheatre was the primary outdoor music venue in the Nashville, Tennessee area from 1986 to 2006. It was owned by Live Nation and had a capacity of 17,137. It had previously been owned by SFX Entertainment and Clear Channel Worldwide, both predecessors of Live Nation.\n\nThe venue was the idea of Steve Moore, former CEO of the Country Music Association. Moore began working for PACE Concerts, in Houston booking acts for AstroWorld and Six Flags Over Texas. In 1985, Moore moved to Nashville in hopes of opening a venue tailored to acts like The Beach Boys, Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band and the Eagles.\n\nThe amphitheater broke ground November 11, 1985. In June 1986, the amphitheater opened as Nashville's premier outdoor venue.\n\nLocated in the Nashville suburb of Antioch, the amphitheatre featured one large stage, a covered pavilion with reserved box seating, and an open-air grassy area for general admission seating. A much smaller stage was located near the venue's north entrance and usually featured local bands entertaining audiences as they entered the venue. For larger music festivals, a temporary third stage would be erected in a fenced area normally used as a parking lot.\n\nStarwood regularly hosted most of Nashville's summer concerts featuring A-list artists from all genres of music. The typical season, which generally ran from April to October, featured 20 to 25 events.\n\nStarwood was criticized for the lack of sufficient road infrastructure in the area. Though within two miles (3 km) of Interstate 24, Starwood was located along Tennessee State Route 171 (Old Hickory Blvd), a two-lane road in a primarily residential and industrial neighborhood. It was also located along U.S. Route 41 (Murfreesboro Road), a four-lane highway that does not intersect a freeway in the immediate area. Therefore, larger crowds would result in major traffic problems both before and after events. Event attendees often faced hours before and after events waiting in the traffic on the two lane road location of the main venue entrance.\n\nAggressive security policies, such as preventing any consumption of alcohol in the parking lots before concerts, led to many concert-goers boycotting the venue through the 1990s and up to the time of its closure.\n\nStarwood Amphitheatre was not affiliated with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide.\n\nAfter opening as Starwood Amphitheatre in 1985, the venue went through several name changes in its later years. Prior to the 1999 season, naming rights were sold to locally based First American National Bank for five years, and the venue was renamed First American Music Center. That October, First American National Bank merged into Alabama-based AmSouth Bancorporation. AmSouth agreed to assume the naming rights upon the merger, and after just one season with its new name, the venue was renamed AmSouth Amphitheatre in 2000. AmSouth declined to extend the naming rights agreement past the initial five-year deal, and without a new suitor, the venue reverted to its original name in 2004.\n\nOn February 13, 2007, Live Nation announced its intention to close Starwood Amphitheatre and cancel the 2007 season in anticipation of a potential sale, despite an earlier statement that the 2007 season would take place as scheduled.\n\nEntertainment industry insiders blame the closing on Starwood's age and size, calling it a \"first-generation\" outdoor venue that was only about two-thirds the size of the ones being built today and one that lacked now-standard amenities for both patrons and performers, therefore not able to attract the top-tier artists who demand larger, more modern performance venues.\n\nStarwood grossed only $4.6 million in ticket sales during the 2006 season and was one of four underperforming venues that Live Nation put up for sale following the season. Only two events were scheduled for 2007 before the announcement to close the venue: The Charlie Daniels Band's annual Volunteer Jam, and a Brad Paisley/Kellie Pickler show.\n\nThe last show at Starwood featured Aerosmith and Mötley Crüe, two bands who had played there many times over the years.\n\nThe Starwood offices and concession areas were demolished during the last half of September 2007, culminating with the dynamite demolition of the stage, seating area, and dressing rooms on September 29, 2007.\n\nLive Nation announced on April 30, 2007 that the buyer of the Starwood property is Vastland Realty Group.

After a long period with the Canadian National Railway, it is now operated by the New England Central Railroad. The New London Northern was the only through railroad in Connecticut not to come under the control of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.\n\nThe New London, Willimantic and Springfield Railroad was chartered in May 1847 to build from New London on the Long Island Sound north through Willimantic to Springfield, Massachusetts. On April 10, 1848, the name was changed to the New London, Willimantic and Palmer Railroad with the shift of the north terminus to Palmer. The first section, from Norwich north to Willimantic, opened in September 1849, and the part from Norwich south to New London opened the next month. The part north to Stafford opened in March 1850, and the rest of the way to Palmer opened in September of that year.\n\nA steamship line continued from New London to New York City via the Long Island Sound.\n\nThe Amherst and Belchertown Railroad was chartered on May 24, 1851. Construction began on April 23, 1852, and the full line opened May 9, 1853, from Palmer north to Amherst via Belchertown. It went bankrupt in 1857, was sold at auction on October 14, 1858, and was reorganized on November 23 of that year as the Amherst, Belchertown and Palmer Railroad.\n\nThe New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic and Palmer on April 1, 1861. In March 1864, it bought the Amherst, Belchertown and Palmer, extending the line north to Amherst. An extension north to Millers Falls on the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad opened in 1867.\n\nOn December 1, 1871, the Central Vermont Railroad leased the New London Northern and made it its Southern Division. The connection between the two lines was made over the Vermont Valley Railroad and the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad's Brattleboro Branch.\n\nThe Ware River Railroad opened in stages from 1870 to 1873, running from Palmer north to Winchendon. It was leased to the New London Northern until April 1, 1873, when the Boston and Albany Railroad took it over.\n\nOn May 1, 1880, the New London Northern bought the branch of the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad from Millers Falls north to Brattleboro, part of its original main line, extending the line north to Brattleboro. Just prior to that lease, in February, the narrow gauge Brattleboro and Whitehall Railroad was leased, providing a branch from Brattleboro northwest to a dead end at South Londonderry (never extended as planned to Whitehall, New York).\n\nIn 1896, the Grand Trunk Railway bought the Central Vermont. The Grand Trunk was merged into the Canadian National Railway in 1923.\n\nThe Brattleboro and Whitehall Railroad went bankrupt and was foreclosed in March 1905. The West River Railroad was chartered in May of that year as a reorganization, and the line was converted to .\n\nOn February 3, 1995, the New London Northern's line became part of the New England Central Railroad, a regional railroad from New London north to East Alburg, Vermont. This change in operation was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission on December 9, 1994.\n\nThe Palmertown Branch ran west from Montville, Connecticut to Palmertown.\n\nThe Fitchville Branch ran from Fitchville Junction, in the northwest part of Norwich, Connecticut, west to Fitchville.\n\nThe Flynt Granite Company built the Flynt's Granite Branch Railroad to their quarries in Monson, Massachusetts. It was owned and operated by the granite company.\n\nAs noted above, the Central Vermont Railway bought the NLN. The latter's passenger service appeared on 20th century passenger timetables as a division of the Central Vermont Railway. The CV continued passenger service on the Brattleboro - Amherst - Palmer - Norwich - New London route until September 27, 1947. The Mansfield stop provided the nearest point of rail access to the University of Connecticut at Storrs. In 1989 passenger service was restored on the line when Amtrak rerouted the \"Montrealer\" over the line, however, only with stops between the Atlantic Coast and the Vermont border being New London, Amherst and Palmer. (In 1991 Willimantic was added as an intermediate stop.) However, service on the line was eliminated in 1995.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298125", "title": "Serbian culture", "text": "Serbian culture\n\nSerbian culture refers to the culture of Serbia and of ethnic Serbs.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire had a great influence on the culture; Serbs were initially governing the Byzantine and Frankish frontiers in the name of the emperors and were later through their sworn alliance given independence, baptized by Greek missionaries and adopted the Cyrillic script, with Latin and Catholic influences in the southern regions. The Serbian Orthodox Church gained autocephaly from Constantinople in 1219, whereas Stefan the First Crowned was declared king by the Pope. The Republic of Venice influenced the maritime regions in the Middle Ages. The Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia in 1459 and ruled the territory for several centuries, the consequences of which suppressed Serbian culture but also greatly influenced Serbian Art, especially in the southern regions. Meanwhile, in northern regions Habsburg Monarchy expanded into modern Serbian territory starting from the end of the 17th century, culturally bounding this part of the nation to Central Europe rather than Balkans. Central Serbia was the first to emancipate as the Principality of Serbia in 1815, and started to gradually expand into Ottoman and Habsburg-held regions.\n\nFollowing Serbia's autonomy after the Serbian Revolution and eventual independence, the culture of Serbia was restrengthened within its people.\n\nConversion of the South Slavs from Slavic paganism to Christianity began in the early 7th century, long before the Great Schism, the split between the Greek Orthodox East and the Roman Catholic West, the Serbs were first Christinaized during the reign of Heraclius (610–641) but were fully Christianized by Eastern Orthodox Missionaries (Saints) Cyril and Methodius in 869 during Basil I, who sent them after Knez Mutimir, had acknowledged the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. After the Schism, those who lived under the Byzantine sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Roman sphere of influence became Catholic. Later, with the arrival of the Ottoman Empire, one part of Serbs converted to Islam. Their modern descendants are considered to be members of the Gorani and Bosniak ethnic groups.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church was the westernmost bastion of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Europe, which shaped its historical fate through contacts with Catholicism and Islam.\n\nDuring World War II, the Serbs, living in a wide area, were persecuted by various peoples and organizations. The Catholic Croats within the Independent State of Croatia recognized the Serbs only as \"Croats of the Eastern Greek faith\" and had the ideological vision that 1/3 of the Serbs were to be murdered, 1/3 were to be converted and the last third expelled. The outcome of these visions was the death of at least 700,000 people, the religious conversion of 250,000 and the expulsion of 250,000.\n\nAs with most Western cultures, a child is given a first name chosen by their parents but approved by the godparents of the child (the godparents usually approve the parent's choice). The given name comes first, the surname last, e.g. \"Željko Popović\", where \"Željko\" is a first name and \"Popović\" is a family name. Female names end with -a, e.g. Dragan -> Dragana.\n\nPopular names are mostly of Serbian (Slavic), Christian (Biblical), Greek and Latin origin. Some examples are:\n\nMost Serbian surnames (like Bosnian, Croatian and Montenegrin) have the surname suffix -ić (pronounced , Cyrillic: \"-ић\"). This is often transliterated as \"-ic\" or \"-ici\". In history, Serbian names have often been transcribed with a phonetic ending, -ich or -itch. This form is often associated with Serbs from before the early 20th century: hence Milutin Milanković is usually referred to, for historical reasons, as Milutin Milankovitch.\n\nThe -ić suffix, with variants \"-ović\"/\"-ević\", is originally a Slavic diminutive and its meaning has been extended to creating patronymics. Thus the surname Petr(ov)ić signifies \"little Petar\", as does, for example, \"-sen\"/\"-son\" in Scandinavian and to a lesser extent German and English names or a common prefix Mac (\"son of\") in Scottish & Irish, and O' (grandson of) in Irish names. It is estimated that some two thirds of all Serbian surnames end in -ić but that some 80% of Serbs carry such a surname with many common names being spread out among tens and even hundreds of non-related extended families.\n\nOther common surname suffixes are -ov or -in which is the Slavic possessive case suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes \"Nikolin,\" Petar's son \"Petrov,\" and Jovan's son \"Jovanov\". Those are more typical for Serbs from Vojvodina. The two suffixes are often combined.\n\nThe most common surnames are Marković, Nikolić, Petrović, and Jovanović.\n\nMost people in Serbia will have three meals daily, breakfast, lunch and dinner, with lunch being the largest and most important meal. However, traditionally, only lunch and dinner existed, with breakfast being introduced in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nTraditional Serbian cuisine is varied and can be said to be a mix of central European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. Ćevapi consisting of grilled heavily seasoned mixed ground meat patties is considered to be the national dish. Other notable dishes include Koljivo used in religious rituals, Serbian salad, Sarma (stuffed cabbage), podvarak (roast meat with sauerkraut) and Moussaka. Česnica is a traditional bread for Christmas Day.\n\nA number of foods which are simply bought into Supermarkets from the West, are often made at home in Serbia. These include rakija (fruit brandy), slatko, jam, jelly, and pickled foods (notably sauerkraut, ajvar and sausage). The reasons for this range from economical to cultural. Food preparation is a strong part of the Serbian family tradition.\n\nSerbian desserts are a mixture of other Balkan desserts and desserts native to central Serbia. Desserts served are usually Uštipci, Tulumbe, Krofne and Palačinke (crepes). Slatko is a traditional Serbian dessert popular throughout Serbia and it can be found in most Serbian restaurants in the Balkans and in the diaspora.\n\nBeer is widely consumed in Serbia. The most popular brands are Jelen Pivo and Lav Pivo. Rakija, a plum brandy commonly known by popular brand name Slivovitz (original spelling šljivovica, from \"šljiva\" = plum) is a distilled fermented plum juice. This is the national drink of Serbia with 70% of domestic plum production being used to make it. Domestic wine is also popular. Turkish coffee is widely consumed as well.\n\nSerbs speak the Serbian language, a member of the South Slavic group of languages, specifically in the Southwestern Slavic subgroup together with other Serbo-Croatian varieties and Slovenian. It is mutually intelligible with the Croatian and Bosnian language (see Differences in standard Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian) and most linguists consider it one of the standard varieties of the common Serbo-Croatian language.\n\nThe Serbian language comprises several dialects, the standard language is based on the Stokavian dialect.\n\nIt is an official language in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, North Macedonia and Romania, it is a regionally recognized minority language.\n\nThere are also historical variants of the Serbian language, namely Old Serbian and Slavonic-Serbian, a blend of Church Slavonic, Russian and Serbian.\n\nSerbian is the only European language with active digraphia, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Vuk Karadžić, who created the alphabet on phonemic principles, the Cyrillic itself has its origins in Cyril and Methodius transformation from the Greek script. The Latin alphabet used for Serbian is Ljudevit Gaj's version shared by all Southwestern Slavic languages.\n\nLoanwords in the Serbian language are mostly from Turkish, German and Italian, words of Hungarian origin is present mostly in the north and Greek words mostly in the liturgy.\n\nTwo Serbian words that are used in many of the world's languages are vampire and paprika. Slivovitz and ćevapčići are Serbian words which have spread together with the Serbian food/drink they refer to. Paprika and Slivovitz are borrowed via German; paprika itself entered German via Hungarian. Vampire entered most West European languages through German-language texts in the early 18th century and has since spread widely in the world.\n\n\"Miroslav's Gospel\" is one of the earliest works of Serbian literature dating from between 1180 and 1191 and one of the most important works of the medieval period. This work was entered into UNESCO's \"Memory of the World\" program in 2005. Serbian epic poetry was a central part of medieval Serbian literature based on historic events such as the Battle of Kosovo.\n\nIn the 20th century, Serbian literature flourished and a myriad of young and talented writers appeared. The most well known authors are Ivo Andrić, Miloš Crnjanski, Meša Selimović, Borislav Pekić, Danilo Kiš, Milorad Pavić, David Albahari, Miodrag Bulatović, Dobrica Ćosić, Zoran Živković and many others. Jelena Dimitrijević and Isidora Sekulić are two early 20th century women writers, while Svetlana Velmar-Janković was the best known female novelist in mid 20th and early 21st century. \nIvo Andrić won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961.\n\nMilorad Pavić is one of the most widely acclaimed Serbian authors, most notably for his \"Dictionary of the Khazars\", which has been translated in 38 languages.\n\nSerbs have many traditions. The Slava is exclusive custom of the Serbs, each family has one patron saint that they venerate on their feast day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian calendar, as per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls currently on January 7 of the Gregorian calendar, thus the Serbs celebrate Christmas on January 7, shared with the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and the Greek Old Calendarists.\n\n\nThe Serbs are a highly family-oriented society. A glance into a Serbian dictionary and the richness of their terminology related to kinship speaks volumes.\n\nOf all Slavs and Orthodox Christians, only Serbs have the custom of \"slava\". The \"Slava\" is the celebration of a family's patron saint; unlike most customs that are common for the whole people, each family separately celebrates its own saint (of course, there is a lot of overlap) who is considered its protector. A \"slava\" is inherited, mostly, though not exclusively from father to son (if a family has no son and a daughter stays in parental house and her husband moves in, her \"Slava\", not his, is celebrated). Each household has only one saint it celebrates, which means that the occasion brings all of the family together. However, since many saints (e.g. St. Nicholas, St. John the Baptist, St. George, St. Archangels of Gabriel and Michael, and the Apostles St. Peter and Paul) have two feast days, both are marked.\n\nThe traditional dance is a circle dance called \"kolo\", which is common among Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians. It is a collective dance, where a group of people (usually several dozen, at the very least three) hold each other by the hands or around the waist dancing, forming a circle (hence the name), semicircle or spiral. It is called \"Oro\" in Montenegro. Similar circle dances also exist in other cultures of the region.\n\nSerbs have their own customs regarding Christmas. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar, so Christmas currently falls on January 7 of the Gregorian calendar. Early in the morning of Christmas Eve, the head of the family would go to a forest in order to cut \"badnjak\", a young oak, the oak tree would then be brought into the church to be blessed by the priest. Then the oak tree would be stripped of its branches with combined with wheat and other grain products would be burned in the fireplace. The burning of the \"badnjak\" is a ritual which is most certainly of pagan origin and it is considered a sacrifice to God (or the old pagan gods) so that the coming year may bring plenty of food, happiness, love, luck and riches. Nowadays, with most Serbs living in towns, most simply go to their church service to be given a small parcel of oak, wheat and other branches tied together to be taken home and set afire. The house floor and church is covered with hay, reminding worshippers of the stable in which Jesus was born.\n\nChristmas Day itself is celebrated with a feast, necessarily featuring roasted piglet as the main meal. The most important Christmas meal is \"česnica\", a special kind of bread. The bread contains a coin; during the lunch, the family breaks up the bread and the one who finds the coin is said to be assured of an especially happy year.\n\nChristmas is not associated with presents like in the West, although it is the day of Saint Nicholas, the protector saint of children, to whom presents are given. However, most Serbian families give presents on New Year's Day. Santa Claus (\"Deda Mraz\" (literally meaning \"Grandpa Frost\")) and the Christmas tree (but rather associated with New Year's Day) are also used in Serbia as a result of globalisation. Serbs also celebrate the Old New Year (currently on January 14 of the Gregorian calendar).\n\nOn Orthodox Easter, Serbs have the tradition of Slavic Egg decorating.\n\nAnother related feature, often lamented by Serbs themselves, is disunity and discord; as Slobodan Naumović puts it, \"Disunity and discord have acquired in the Serbian popular imaginary a notorious, quasi-demiurgic status. They are often perceived as being the chief malefactors in Serbian history, causing political or military defeats, and threatening to tear Serbian society completely apart.\" That disunity is often quoted as the source of Serbian historic tragedies, from the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 to Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Even the contemporary notion of \"two Serbia's\"—one supposedly liberal, pro-European, Eurocentric and pro-western, and the other conservative, nationalist, Russophilic and Eurosceptic—seems to be the extension of the said discord. Popular proverbs \"two Serbs, three political parties\" and \"God save us from Serbs that may unite!\", and even the unofficial Serbian motto \"Only Unity Saves the Serbs\" (\"Samo sloga Srbina spasava\") illustrate the national frustration with the inability to unite over important issues.\n\nSerbian has a long tradition of humour and popular jokes. The most common type of humour is Black Humour and Serbian jokes are often imitated by other peoples from the Balkans, often with a twist. As with many other peoples, there are popular stereotypes on the local level: in popular jokes and stories, northern Serbs of Vojvodina (\"Lale\") are perceived as phlegmatic, undisturbed and slow; Montenegrins are lazy and pushy; southern Serbs are misers; Bosnians are raw and simple; Serbs from Central Serbia (\"Šumadija\") are often portrayed as capricious and malicious, etc. Also, policemen and blondes are mocked as being stupid.\n\nThere was some resumption of artistic endeavour after the restoration of the Serbian patriarch in 1557. Djordje Mitrofanović was the leading painter of the early 17th century with his work on the church at the Morača Monastery considered as amongst his best.\n\nA Baroque church 'Our Lady of the Rocks' on an island in the Boka Kotorska, in Montenegro is one of the most notable pieces of architecture in the Serbian lands from the early modern period. There are many fine specimens of silverware dating from the 17th century there. Traditional Serbian art was beginning to show some Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of Nikola Nešković, Teodor Kračun and Jakov Orfelin.\n\nThere was somewhat of a resurgence in Serbian art in the 19th century as Serbia gradually regained its autonomy. Prince Aleksandar commissioned the building of a Monument to the Insurgents in Karađorđev Park in 1848 in Vračar. Serbian paintings showed the influence of Neoclassicism and Romanticism during the 19th century. Anastas Jovanović was a pioneering photographer in Serbia taking the photos of many leading citizens.\n\nKirilo Kutlik set up the first school of art in Serbia in 1895. Many of his students went to study in Western Europe, especially France and Germany and brought back avant-garde styles. Nadežda Petrović was influenced by Fauvism while Sava Šumanović worked in Cubism.\n\nAfter World War I, the Belgrade School of Painting developed in the capital with some members such as Milan Konjović working in a Fauvist manner, while others such as Marko Čelebonović working in a style called \"Intimisme\" based on the use of colours.\n\nThe most famous Serbian painters were Paja Jovanović and Uroš Predić, painting in the Realist style. Their monumental paintings of historical events have inspired generations of Serbian artists.\n\nSerbian music dates from the medieval period with strong church and folk traditions. Church music in Serbia of the time was based on the Osmoglasnik a cycle of religious songs based on the resurrection and lasting for eight weeks. During the Nemanjić dynasty and under other rulers such as Stefan Dušan, musicians enjoyed royal patronage. There was a strong folk tradition in Serbia dating from this time.\n\nDuring Ottoman rule, Serbs were forbidden to own property, to learn to read and write and denied the use of musical instruments. Church music had to be performed in private. Gusle, a one-stringed instrument, was used by Serbian peasants during this time in an effort to find a loophole through the stringent Ottoman laws. Filip Višnjić was a particularly notable guslar (gusle player). In the 18th century, Russian and Greek chant schools were established and the Serbian Orthodox Church accepted Church Slavonic into their liturgy.\n\nFolk music enjoyed a resurgence in the nineteenth century. Stevan Mokranjac, a composer and musicologist collected folk songs as well as performing his own work. Kornelije Stanković wrote the first Serbian language works for choirs.\n\nTraditional Serbian folk music remains popular today especially in rural areas. Western rock and pop music has become increasingly popular especially in cities with rock acts such as Riblja Čorba and Đorđe Balašević incorporating political statements in their music. Turbo-folk combined Western rock and pop styles with traditional folk music vocals. Serbian immigrants have taken their musical traditions to nations such as the US and Canada.\n\nMarija Šerifović won first place at the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest, and Serbia was the host of the 2008 contest.\n\nSeveral notable composers used motifs from Serbian folk music and composed works inspired by Serbian history or culture, such as: Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt, Arthur Rubinstein, Antonín Dvořák, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Franz Schubert, Hans Huber and other.\n\nSerbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with many theatres. The Serbian National Theatre was established in 1861 with its building dating from 1868. The company started performing opera from the end of the 19th century and the permanent opera was established in 1947. It established a ballet company.\n\nBitef, Belgrade International Theatre Festival, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world. New Theatre Tendencies is the constant subtitle of the Festival. Founded in 1967, Bitef has continually followed and supported the latest theater trends. It has become one of five most important and biggest European festivals. It has become one of the most significant culture institutions of Serbia.\n\nCinema was established reasonably early in Serbia with 12 feature films being produced before the start of World War II. The most notable of the prewar films was Mihailo Popovic's The Battle of Kosovo in 1939.\n\nCinema prospered after World War II. The most notable postwar director was Dušan Makavejev who was internationally recognised for \"\" in 1969 focusing on Yugoslav politics. Makavejev's \"Montenegro\" was made in Sweden in 1981. Zoran Radmilović was one of the most notable actors of the postwar period.\n\nSerbian cinema continued to make progress in the 1990s and today despite the turmoil of the 1990s. Emir Kusturica won two Golden Palms for Best Feature Film at the Cannes Film Festival, for \"When Father Was Away on Business\" in 1985 and then again for \"Underground\" in 1995. In 1998, Kusturica won a Silver Lion for directing \"Black Cat, White Cat\".\n\nSerbia has a long tradition of handicrafts. Đakovica in Kosovo was known for its black pottery. Pirot in eastern Serbia became known for its ceramics under the Ottomans with the potters following Byzantine designs. It also became a centre for the production of Kilims or rugs.\n\nThe Slavs introduced jewellery making to Serbia in the sixth century AD. Metalworking started to develop on a significant scale following the development of a Serbian state. Workshops were set up in towns, large estates and in monasteries. The Studenica Monastery was known for the quality of its goldsmithing. Coins were minted not only by the kings but some of the wealthier nobility. The nobility also was influenced by the wealth of the Byzantine court. Metalworking like many other arts and crafts went into decline following the Ottoman conquest. However, there was a partial revival in later centuries with a strong Baroque influence notably the 17th century silverware at \"Our Lady on the Rocks\" on Boka Kotorska.\n\nAs of 2001, there were 27 daily newspapers and 580 other newspapers published in Serbia. Some of these newspapers have Internet editions. \"Politika\" founded in 1904 is the oldest daily newspaper in the Balkans. There were also 491 periodical magazines published in Serbia with the \"Nedeljne informativne novine\" (NIN) and \"Vreme\" amongst the most notable.\n\nTelevision broadcasting started in 1958 with every country in the former Yugoslavia having its own station. In Serbia, the state television station was known as RTB and became known as RTS (Radio Television of Serbia) after the breakup of Yugoslavia. From the time of Yugoslavia until the Bulldozer Revolution in 2000, state broadcasting was controlled by the ruling party. The RTS station was bombed during NATO's 1999 air-strikes against Yugoslavia, as they claimed this was being used for propaganda.\n\nThere was some private broadcasting with the B92 radio and television station starting in 1989 although it was shut down in 1999 during the hostilities. After the fall of Milošević, RTS became known as \"new\" RTS as an assertion of independence while B92 commenced broadcasting. During 2001, there were 70 television centres in Serbia of which 24 were privately owned. In 2003, there was a return to censorship as the Government of Zoran Živković temporarily imposed a state of emergency following the assassination of Zoran Djindjic and the European Federation of Journalists continues to hold concerns over media freedom in the country.\n\nSerbia is very successful in many sports. Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, water polo, sport shooting, handball, volleyball and tennis.\n\nThe two most popular football clubs in Serbia are Red Star Belgrade and FK Partizan. Their supporters are the Delije and the Grobari, respectively. The Serbian national football team participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn basketball, Serbian clubs are successful and participate regularly in European competitions, where they often make quarter-final and semi-final appearances. The Serbian national basketball team is successful in international competitions, having won several FIBA World Championship, EuroBasket and Olympic gold medals.\n\nSerbian men's and women's teams are also World Champions in sports such as water polo and volleyball.\n\nSerbian tennis players have been successful. Novak Djokovic is the current World No. 2 and he has won sixteen Grand Slam Singles titles so far. Janko Tipsarević, Viktor Troicki, Jelena Janković and Ana Ivanovic are also successful. The Serbia Davis Cup team won the 2010 Davis Cup Final held in the Belgrade Arena.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, there were 32 art galleries and 142 museums in Serbia. Belgrade has many of the most significant with the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade, the Gallery of Frescoes featuring Orthodox Church art, the Ethnographic Museum and the Princess Ljubica's Residence. Novi Sad contains the Museum of Vojvodina, Gallery of Matica Srpska as well as the Petrovaradin fortress.\n\nMatica Srpska is the oldest and most notable cultural and scientific organisation in today's Serbia. Its name is translated in Serbian as the Serbian matrix or parent body of the Serbs. It was founded in 1826 in Budapest and moved to Novi Sad in 1864. Amongst other achievements, it compiled a six-volume study of the Serbian language between 1967 and 1976. Its journal \"Letopis Matice Srpske\" is one of the oldest periodicals examining scientific and cultural issues anywhere in the world. Vojvodina province of Austro-Hungary became attractive for Serbs ever since the fall of Serbia in the 15th century, and was the site of the Great Serbian Migrations, when Serbs colonized the area escaping Turkish vengeance. Sremski Karlovci became the spiritual, political and cultural centre of the Serbs in the Habsburg Empire, with Metropolitan of the Serbian Orthodox Church residing in the town. To this day, Serbian Patriarch retains the title of \"Metropolitan of (Sremski) Karlovci\". The town featured the earliest Serb and Slavic grammar school (Serbian: gimnazija/гимназија, French: Lycée) founded on August 3, 1791. In 1794, an Orthodox seminary was also founded in the town, ranking second oldest in the world (after the Spiritual Academy in Kiev). Novi Sad is home to Serbia's oldest professional theatre, founded in 1861 as Serbian National Theatre (\"serbian\": Srpsko Narodno Pozorište), followed by Belgrade in 1868; however two other cities claim this title: City of Kragujevac Knjazesko Srbski Teatar since 1835 and Subotica since 1851 (*there were theatres throughout Serbia long before that time but cannot be classified as \"professional\").\n\nThere is a network of libraries with three national libraries, 689 public libraries, 143 higher education libraries and 11 non-specialised libraries as at 1998. The National Library of Serbia is the most significant of these. Project Rastko founded in 1997 is an Internet library of Serb culture.\n\nRoots to the Serbian education system date back to 11th and 12th centuries when first Catholic colleges were founded in Vojvodina (Titel, Bac). Medieval Serbian education however was mostly conducted through the Serbian Orthodox monasteries (UNESCO protected Sopoćani, Studenica, Patriarchate of Peć) starting from the rise of Raška in the 12th century, when Serbs overwhelmingly embraced Orthodoxy rather than Catholicism. The first European-style higher education facilities however were founded in Catholic Vojvodina, Teacher's College in Subotica in 1689, although several facilities have functioned even before (e.g. Jesuit School in Belgrade, since 1609). Following short-lived Serbian independence between 1804 and 1813, Belgrade officially became an educational centre of the country (excluding Vojvodina). The University of Belgrade is the biggest and most prestigious institution of higher education in Serbia, founded as the Belgrade Higher School in 1808. The Gymnasium Jovan Jovanović Zmaj was founded in 1810 and many important Serb cultural figures studied there.\n\nWithin the Government of Serbia, the Serbian Ministry for Culture is responsible for administering its cultural facilities.\n\n\nBoth the eagle and the cross, besides being the basis for various Serbian coats of arms through history, are bases for the symbols of various Serbian organizations, political parties, institutions and companies.\n\nSerbian folk attire varies, mostly because of the very diverse geography and climate of the territory inhabited by the Serbs.

She succeeded Queen Zabibe (Arabic meaning \"Raisin\"). Tiglath-Pileser III (Pileser (Babylonian (Pulu) son of Ashur-nirari V), the king of Assyria, was the first foreign ruler to bring the Arabs under his control. When Samsi rebelled against him by joining an alliance forged by Rakhianu of Damascus, Pileser attacked and defeated Samsi, made her and her alliance partners surrender, and pay a tribute to remain in power. She ruled for 20 years and her successor was Queen Iatie, in about 700 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian chronicles describe Queen Samsi as a powerful ruler who was bold enough to face the Assyrian kings in the 730s and 720s. She and others are mentioned as rulers of the regions far to the west of Assyria who were aware of the Assyrian kings and had trade with them in spices Samsi and her predecessor and successor queens had led embassies and caravans carrying spices and incense to the Near East and Syria from the Arabian Peninsula.\nSamsi had come to power as a vassal of Assyria, succeeding the former Arabian queen Zabibe, who had abdicated in Samsi's favour. Zabibe's oath of allegiance was continued by Samsi on taking the throne; she swore by the sun, the god of Arabia, that she would be loyal to Assyria. Tiglath-Pileser gave formal recognition to this accession. Later, however, she changed her mind and rebelled, joining an alliance made by Rakhianu of Damascus to fight the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 732 BCE.\n\nThe Assyrian army under King Tiglath-Pileser III (ruled 745–727 BCE) had recently subjugated the land of Edom and now turned its attention to the anti-Assyrian forces in Arabia and the Levant. According to the Assyrian records, Tiglath-Pileser attacked many Arab tribal areas and defeated Samsi in the neighborhood of Mount \"Sa-qu-ur-ri\" (a place not identified). The Assyrians took many prisoners of war, 30,000 camels, and more than 20,000 oxen as booty. An inscription records that 9,400 of her soldiers were killed, and in addition 5,000 bags of various types of spices, altars of gods, armaments including an ornamental staff of her goddess, and her estates were seized. As she fled to the desert, Tiglath-Pileser set fire to the remaining tents at the battle site.\n\nAfter her defeat, Samsi was said by the Assyrian chroniclers to have fled the battlefield like a \"wild she-ass of the desert\". She did not remain at liberty for long, as she was soon captured and brought as prisoner to Tiglath-Pileser. He appointed a \"qepu\" or governor over her and 10,000 soldiers, and restored her to her kingdom. It is also said that she had escaped to the land of Bazu/Basu and later surrendered. The terms of surrender to Tiglath-Pileser involved a tribute to be paid by Samsi. The Assyrians chose to restore her as they needed a pliable Arab ruler in order to maintain the lucrative north-south trade route from Assyrian territory across Arabia. Seven other kingdoms involved in Arabian commerce were also required to pay tribute and provide security to their incense trade; these seven kingdoms were Massa, Tyma, Saba, Haiappa (Ephah), Badana, Hattia, and Idibi'lu. The tribute agreed to be paid by the Arabs included gold, silver, male and female camels, and all types of spices.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298154", "title": "White lion", "text": "White lion\n\nThe white lion is a rare color mutation of the lion, specifically the Southern African lion. White lions in the area of Timbavati were thought to have been indigenous to the Timbavati region of South Africa for centuries, although the earliest recorded sighting in this region was in 1938. Regarded as divine by locals, white lions first came to public attention in the 1970s, in Chris McBride's book \"The White Lions of Timbavati\".\n\nWhite lions are not albinos. Their white color is caused by a recessive trait derived from a less-severe mutation in the same gene that causes albinism, distinct from the gene responsible for white tigers. They vary from blonde to near-white. This coloration does not appear to pose a disadvantage to their survival. The white lions have been reintroduced into their natural habitat and have been hunting and breeding successfully without human intervention for a significant amount of time.\n\nA recessive gene gives white lions their unusual colors. A similar gene also produces white tigers. White lions can therefore be selectively bred for zoos, animal shows and wildlife parks. Such breeding involves inbreeding and can result in inbreeding depression (genetic defects, reduced fertility, and physical defects), although this has not yet been found to cause hind-limb paralysis or serious heart defects, which would indicate a severe level of inbreeding. Some are concerned about white lions mating with lions of other alleles, due to possible extinction of the white lion allele. However, this is not valid as the offspring will inherit the recessive white gene and therefore make it possible to produce white offspring in a later generation, thus making the allele more widespread. Some critics maintain that white lions should not be introduced into the wild because of the inbreeding that has taken place in zoos and breeding camps. However, ethical reintroduction programs such as The Global White Lion Protection Trust have ensured through the use of scientific methodologies that the lions in their program are not inbred.\n\n\nLory Park Zoo is currently in possession of two adult white lions (Daniel and Heidi), who have produced eight cubs. A litter of three cubs was born in 2012 and all three were hand-reared. A second litter of five cubs was born in 2013; three were removed for their own well-being while the remaining two (a male, Gabriel, and a female, Gazelle) were left with the parents. Both cubs are still with the parents and have not been handled by humans. A male cub was traded for other animals in August 2013 and now lives at the Hodonin Zoo in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 1979, three litters containing white lions were recorded in Kruger National Park. In March, a female lion with three white cubs was observed near Tshokwane. In September, three white cubs (from two different lionesses) were seen. Another litter of white female cubs was captured from Kruger National Park and treated for sarcoptic mange. A white lion was observed in the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve in Zululand.\n\nIn 2018, Mufasa, a three-year-old, was in the process of being sold in South Africa after he was taken from an owner illegally keeping him as a pet. An anonymous buyer wanted both Mufasa and a female lion named Soraya, intending to protect both. Over 280,000 signed a petition asking that Mufasa not be auctioned, fearing a buyer might just want the lion for hunting.\n\nThe European Association of Zoos and Aquaria opposes the deliberate breeding of white lions.\nIn 2004, four white lions arrived at West Midland Safari Park, the only white lions in the United Kingdom. Roland (or Rowland), the male, and three lionesses (Marin, Natasha, and JoAnn; spellings undocumented) settled into the Kingdom of the White Lion exhibit at the park very well. In 2008 one lioness had four cubs in the space of nine hours, doubling the total to eight in England. The pride at the Park in Worcestershire is the only pride of white lion in the UK.\n\nNewspapers and bloggers reported that the four cubs born at West Midlands Safari Park, in 2008 (names: Caspar, Kiara, Lara and Toto; spellings undocumented) had been sold to perform in a Japanese circus. It is alleged that the lions were given to British businessman Jim Clubb, who runs Amazing Animals, which also goes by the name Heythrop Zoological Gardens, in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. The animal rights organization Lion Aid, Ltd., quoted Mr. Clubb as saying, first, \"No comment,\" then, \"I've no idea if the West Midland Safari Park knew they were going to the circus, that's a matter for them.\" Bob Lawrence, the Head Keeper of West Midland Safari Park, who appears often in the YouTube videos raising the cubs, told the \"Worcester News\", a local newspaper, that he \"would never have supplied the four white lion cubs if he had known they would have ended up performing in a Japanese circus.\"\n\nIn May 2007 four white lion cubs were born at Jurques Zoo in France. The cubs consisted of one male and three females. Each cub weighed approximately at birth, and all four were in good health. However, they needed to be hand fed because their mother was not taking proper care of them.\n\nA private zoo in Abony, Hungary recently acquired two white lion cubs, one male and one female lion.\n\nBelgrade Zoo in Serbia has 12 white lions. In 2010 four were born by two female lions, each weighing about 1.5 kg (3.3 pounds). Four additional white lions were born in April 2011. One more cub was born in October 2013, but died soon after.\n\nPafos Zoo, an Animal and Bird wildlife park in Cyprus, received two seven-month-old white lion cubs in 2011.\n\nIn December 2013, four white lion cubs were born at Tbilisi Zoo in Georgia. Cubs needed to be hand fed because their mother wasn't taking proper care of them. Another three cubs were born in May 2014.\n\nIn 2012, the Karachi Zoo, Pakistan, purchased a juvenile male and juvenile female white lion. They have had 2 cubs.\n\nThe first white lions introduced into Malaysia was in March 2013 when the Safari Park in Bukit Gambang Resort City (Pahang) opened its door to the public. With 2 males and 3 females, the first white lion was born in May 2014 and was named King.\n\nA couple of white lions named Zola and Zuri reside in the Sunway Lagoon's Wildlife Park since April 2015.\n\nSingapore Night Safari, A subsidiary of Wildlife Reserves Singapore, recently acquired two white lions, a male and a female.\n\nIn 2012, Toronto Zoo in Canada received three white lions to their African zone and replacing the single white lioness the zoo had since 1996. In September 2015, four white lion cubs were born at the zoo.\n\nIn 1998, Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio received two white lions from Siegfried & Roy's White Lion exhibit. <ref>\n"}

The following year he won the Circuit Français Peugeot, followed by stage races from Paris to Toulouse and Paris to Turin. He then turned professional to ride the Tour de France.\n\nThys won the Tour in 1913 despite breaking his bicycle fork, and needing to find a bicycle shop to mend it. The repair induced a 10-minute penalty, but he won with a lead of just under nine minutes. Thys took the stage and the race lead when Eugène Christophe broke his fork on the way to Luchon. Marcel Buysse overtook him in the results the following day. Another broken fork on the way to Nice gave Thys the lead again but drama continued when he fell on the penultimate stage from Longwy to Dunkirk. Despite being knocked out and being penalised for help from teammates to repair his bike, he won 8 minutes and 37 seconds ahead of Gustave Garrigou, with Buysse third.\n\nIn 1914, he took his first stage victory, to Le Havre, holding the race from start to finish despite a 30-minute penalty for an unauthorised wheel change on the penultimate stage. His victory looked uncertain, his lead cut to less than two minutes ahead of Henri Pélissier. Ironically, on the final stage from Dunkirk to Paris, the Frenchman's supporters along the route who were expecting victory over the Belgian were the reason he was prevented from launching a breakaway. He won the stage but Thys finished on his wheel to win the Tour.\n\nIn 1917, Thys won Paris–Tours and the Giro di Lombardia. In 1918, he also won the second and last Tours–Paris. After World War I, Thys won the Tour a third and final time in 1920. He led from the second stage, Henri Desgrange writing \"France is not unaware that, without the war, the crack rider from Anderlecht would be celebrating not his third Tour, but his fifth or sixth\".\n\nNot until 1955 did Louison Bobet equal Thys's record, and not until 1963 did Jacques Anquetil break it with four wins. Thys also rode in the 1922 Tour, winning five stages, and in the 1924 Tour, winning two stages.\n\nThys was one of a generation of cyclists whose careers were disrupted by the First World War. After retiring, he recalled that he had been asked by his manager, Alphonse Baugé, to wear a yellow jersey as leader of the Tour, although that distinction is more commonly attributed to Eugène Christophe.\n\n"}

The Australian brushturkey has also been introduced to Kangaroo Island in South Australia. It is the largest extant representative of the family Megapodiidae, and is one of three species to inhabit Australia.\n\nDespite its name and their superficial similarities, the bird is not closely related to American turkeys, nor to the Australian bustard, which is also known as the bush turkey. Its closest relatives are the wattled brushturkey, Waigeo brushturkey, and malleefowl.\n\nIt is a large bird with black feathers and a red head. Its total length is about and a wingspan of about . The subspecies \"A. l. purpureicollis\" from the northern Cape York Peninsula is smaller than the more widespread nominate subspecies. It has a prominent, fan-like tail flattened sideways, and its plumage is mainly blackish, but with a bare red head, and a yellow (in the nominate subspecies) or purple wattle (in \"A. l. purpureicollis\"). The males' wattles become much larger during breeding season, often swinging from side to side as they run. The males' heads and wattles also become much brighter during the breeding and nesting season. The underside of the body is sprinkled with white feathers, more pronounced in older birds. The brushturkey is a clumsy flyer and cannot fly long distances, only taking to the air when threatened by predators or to roost in trees at night and during the heat of the day.\n\nThey build large nests on the ground made of leaves, other compostable material, and earth, high and up to across. Mound-building is done by a dominant male, and visited by a succession of local females, for mating and egg-laying. The male works tirelessly, collecting material from all around, and also diligently repelling rival males, which are keen to usurp his position. The effort involved eventually wears him down, and he will ultimately be defeated by a new king. The eggs are very large (90 × 45 mm), and the young are fully fledged on hatching. They can fly within hours, as soon as the feathers are dry. The eggs are hatched by the heat of the composting mound, the temperature of which is regulated by adding or removing material to maintain the temperature in the incubation temperature range. The Australian brushturkey checks the temperature by sticking its beak into the mound. Like some reptiles, incubation temperature affects the sex ratio of chicks, but the mechanism is different between reptiles and these birds, with reptiles exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination, and megapodes exhibiting temperature-dependent embryo mortality. The sex ratio in brushturkeys is equal at incubation temperatures of 34°C, but results in more males when cooler and more females when warmer (p=0.035). Whether the parents use this to manipulate the sex of their offspring by, for instance, selecting the nesting site accordingly, is unclear. Warmer incubation also results in heavier, fitter chicks (p<0.0001), but how this is linked to gender is also unknown.\n\nThe same nesting site is frequently used year after year, with the old nests being added to each breeding season. The average clutch of eggs is between 16 and 24 large white eggs, which are laid September to March. Sometimes, up to 50 eggs laid by several females may be found in a single mound. The eggs are placed in a circle roughly down, apart, always with the large end up. The newly hatched young dig themselves out of the mound and then have to care for themselves.\n\nBrushturkey eggs are a favourite food of goannas, snakes, and dingoes and dogs, though brushturkeys were also a staple of Aboriginal Australians. Often, goannas exhibit wounds on their tails from having been pecked by brushturkeys that ferociously chase them away from their nests.\n\nIn situations where they come into contact with humans, such as picnic areas in national parks and suburban gardens, brushturkeys exhibit little fear and often boldly attempt to steal food from tables and raid compost bins. They nest in suburban gardens, and in search of material for their nests remove enormous amounts of mulch from gardens.\n\nThe Australian brushturkey inhabits rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests, but can also be found in drier scrubs and open areas. In the northern part of its range, the Australian brushturkey is most common at higher altitudes, but individuals move to the lowland areas in winter. In the south, it is common in both mountain and lowland regions.\n\nBrushturkeys are now common in urban environments and can be found in backyards in both Brisbane and Sydney.\n\nBrushturkeys are fairly common presently, but in the 1930s, the bird was supposed to be approaching extinction.\n\nBrushturkeys feed upon insects, seeds, and fallen fruits, which are exposed by raking the leaf litter or breaking open rotten logs with their large feet. The majority of food is obtained from the ground, with birds occasionally observed feeding on ripening fruits among tree branches.\n\nThe Australian brushturkey can damage gardens when raking up the ground looking for food. It can also cause extensive damage to food crops. The Department of Environment, Climate Change, and Water provides hints for living with brushturkeys in urban environments.\n\nThey are sometimes hunted for food, including as part of the diet by traditional Aboriginal Australians. Their eggs, which weigh on average , are also sometimes eaten.\n\nThe Australian brush-turkey is fully protected in Queensland. Management of its natural habitat and respect for the bird is important if the brush-turkey is to continue to have a secure future. Under the Nature Conservation Act 1992, it is an offence to harm brush turkeys. For a class 1 offence it is 3000 penalty units or 2 years imprisonment. For a class 4 offence it is 100 penalty units or $13,345.00 Au.\n\nIn New South Wales, shooting a brush turkey has resulted in fines of up to $22,000 under the Biodiversity Conservation Act. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298182", "title": "Traditional grammar", "text": "Traditional grammar\n\nTraditional grammar is a framework for the description of the structure of a language. The roots of traditional grammar are in the work of classical Greek and Latin philologists. The formal study of grammar based on these models became popular during the Renaissance. \n\nTraditional grammars may be contrasted with more modern theories of grammar in theoretical linguistics, which grew out of traditional descriptions. While traditional grammars seek to describe how particular languages are used, or to teach people to speak or read them, grammar frameworks in contemporary linguistics often seek to explain the nature of language knowledge and ability. Traditional grammar is often prescriptive, and may be regarded as unscientific by those working in linguistics.\n\nTraditional Western grammars generally classify words into parts of speech. They describe the patterns for word inflection, and the rules of syntax by which those words are combined into sentences.\n\nAmong the earliest studies of grammar are descriptions of Sanskrit, called vyākaraṇa. The Indian grammarian Pāṇini wrote the \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\", a descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, sometime between the 4th and the 2nd century BCE. This work, along with some grammars of Sanskrit produced around the same time, is often considered the beginning of linguistics as a descriptive science, and consequently wouldn't be considered \"traditional grammar\" despite its aniquity. Although Pāṇini's work was not known in Europe until many centuries later, it is thought to have greatly influenced other grammars produced in Asia, such as the \"Tolkāppiyam\", a Tamil grammar generally dated between the 2nd and 1st century BCE. \n\nThe formal study of grammar became popular in Europe during the Renaissance. Descriptive grammars were rarely used in Classical Greece or in Latin through the Medieval period. During the Renaissance, Latin and Classical Greek were broadly studied along with the literature and philosophy written in those languages. With the invention of the printing press and the use of Vulgate Latin as a lingua franca throughout Europe, the study of grammar became part of language teaching and learning.\n\nAlthough complete grammars were rare, Ancient Greek philologists and Latin teachers of rhetoric produced some descriptions of the structure of language. The descriptions produced by classical grammarians (teachers of philology and rhetoric) provided a model for traditional grammars in Europe. According to linguist William Harris, \"Just as the Renaissance confirmed Greco-Roman tastes in poetry, rhetoric and architecture, it established ancient Grammar, especially that which the Roman school-grammarians had developed by the 4th [century CE], as an inviolate system of logical expression.\" The earliest descriptions of other European languages were modeled on grammars of Latin. The primacy of Latin in traditional grammar persisted until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe use of grammar descriptions in the teaching of language, including foreign language teaching and the study of language arts, has gone in and out of fashion. As education increasingly took place in vernacular languages at the close of the Renaissance, grammars of these languages were produced for teaching. Between 1801 and 1900 there were more than 850 grammars of English published specifically for use in schools. Mastering grammar rules like those derived from the study of Latin has at times been a specific goal of English-language education. This approach to teaching has, however, long competed with approaches that downplay the importance of grammar instruction. Similarly in foreign or second language teaching, the grammar-translation method based on traditional Latin teaching, in which the grammar of the language being learned is described in the student's native language, has competed with approaches such as the direct method or the communicative approach, in which grammar instruction is minimized.\n\nThe parts of speech are an important element of traditional grammars, since patterns of inflection and rules of syntax each depend on a word's part of speech.\n\nAlthough systems vary somewhat, typically traditional grammars name eight parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. These groupings are based on categories of function and meaning in Latin and other Indo-European languages. Some traditional grammars include other parts of speech, such as articles or determiners, though some grammars treat other groupings of words as subcategories of the major parts of speech.\n\nThe traditional definitions of parts of speech refer to the role that a word plays in a sentence, its meaning, or both.\n\n\nContemporary linguists argue that classification based on a mixture of morphosyntactic function and semantic meaning is insufficient for systematic analysis of grammar. Such definitions are not sufficient on their own to assign a word an unambiguous part of speech. Nonetheless, similar definitions have been used in most traditional grammars.\n\nAccidence, also known as inflection, is the change of a word's form depending on its grammatical function. The change may involve the addition of affixes or else changes in the sounds of the word, known as vowel gradation or ablaut. Some words feature irregular inflection, not taking an affix or following a regular pattern of sound change.\n\nVerbs may be inflected for tense, mood, aspect, and voice. A verb inflected for tense and mood is called finite; non-finite verb forms are infinitives or participles.\n\nVerb tense indicates the time that the sentence describes. A verb has person and number, which must agree with the subject of the sentence. The voice of the verb indicates whether the subject of the sentence is active or passive in regard to the verb. A verb also has mood, indicating whether the sentence describes reality or expresses a command, a hypothesis, a hope, etc.\n\nVerbs as well as nouns, pronouns, and adjectives may be inflected for person, number, and gender. The inflection of verbs is also known as conjugation.\n\nNouns, pronouns, and adjectives may also be inflected for case. The inflection of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives is also known as declension.\n\nNoun case indicates how the noun relates to other elements of the sentence (\"I, me\" in \"I see Jesse\" and \"Jesse sees me\"). Number indicates whether the noun refers to one, two, or many instances of its kind. \n\nA traditional means of learning accidence is through conjugation tables or declension tables, lists of the various forms of a word for a learner to memorize. The following tables present partial conjugation of the Latin verb \"esse\" and its English equivalent, \"be\".\nThis partial table includes only two tenses (present and preterite) and one mood (indicative) in addition to the infinitive. A more complete conjugation table for Latin would also include the subjunctive and imperative moods and the imperfect indicative, which indicates imperfective aspect. In English the imperative often has the same form as the infinitive, while the English subjunctive often has the same form as the indicative. English does not have imperfective aspect as Latin does; it has progressive and perfect aspects in addition to the simple form.\n\nSyntax is the set of rules governing how words combine into phrases and clauses. It deals with the formation of sentences, including rules governing or describing how sentences are formed. In traditional usage, syntax is sometimes called \"grammar\", but the word grammar is also used more broadly to refer to various aspects of language and its usage.\n\nIn traditional grammar syntax, a sentence is analyzed as having two parts, a subject and a predicate. The subject is the thing being talked about. In English and similar languages, the subject usually occurs at the beginning of the sentence, but this is not always the case. The predicate comprises the rest of the sentence, all of the parts of the sentence that are not the subject.\n\nThe subject of a sentence is generally a noun or pronoun, or a phrase containing a noun or pronoun. If the sentence features active voice, the thing named by the subject carries out the action of the sentence; in the case of passive voice, the subject is affected by the action. In sentences with imperative mood, the subject may not be expressed.\n\nThe predicate of a sentence may have many parts, but the only required element is a finite verb. In addition to the verb, the predicate may contain one or more objects, a subject complement, object complements, adpositional phrases (in English, these are prepositional phrases), or adverbial elements.\n\nSome verbs (called transitive verbs) take direct objects; some also take indirect objects. A direct object names the person or thing directly affected by the action of an active sentence. An indirect object names the entity indirectly affected. In a sentence with both a direct and an indirect object, the indirect object generally appears before the direct object.\n\nIn the following sentence, the direct object, \"the book\", is directly affected by the action; it is what is given. The indirect object, \"Nikolai\", is indirectly affected; he receives the book as a result of it being given.\nIn place of an indirect object, a prepositional phrase beginning with \"to\" or \"for\" may occur after the direct object.\n\nA subject complement (variously called a predicative expression, predicative, predicate noun or adjective, or complement) appears in a predicate with a linking verb (also called a copula). A subject complement is a noun, adjective, or phrase that refers to the subject of the linking verb, illustrated in the following examples.\nWhile subject complements describe or modify the subject of a linking verb, object complements describe or modify nouns in the predicate, typically direct or indirect objects, or objects of adpositions. In the following example, the phrase \"sun's origin\" is a complement of the direct object \"Japan\".\n\nA subject and a predicate together make up a clause.\n\nAlthough some traditional grammars consider adpositional phrases and adverbials part of the predicate, many grammars call these elements adjuncts, meaning they are not a required element of the syntactic structure. Adjuncts may occur anywhere in a sentence.\n\nAdpositional phrases can add to or modify the meaning of nouns, verbs, or adjectives. An adpositional phrase is a phrase that features either a preposition, a postposition, or a circumposition. All three types of words have similar function; the difference is where the adposition appears relative to the other words in the phrase. Prepositions occur before their complements while postpositions appear after. Circumpositions consist of two parts, one before the complement and one after.\n\nAn adverbial consists of either a single adverb, an adverbial phrase, or an adverbial clause that modifies either the verb or the sentence as a whole. Some traditional grammars consider adpositional phrases a type of adverb, but many grammars treat these as separate. Adverbials may modify time, place, or manner. Negation is also frequently indicated with adverbials, including adverbs such as English \"not\".\n\n"}

She was the first woman awarded the International Master title. Rudenko was also USSR women's champion in 1952.\n\nRudenko was born in 1904 in Lubny, in the Poltava region of what is now Ukraine. At age 10, Rudenko was taught how to play chess by her father—although, at first, she was more interested in swimming. After secondary school, she moved to Odessa and took a degree in economics. Rudenko became the swimming champion of Odessa in the breaststroke. In 1925, she was swimming vice-champion of Ukraine (breaststroke). She started a career as an economic planner for the Soviet Union, and chess became a hobby.\n\nRudenko began playing tournament chess in 1925 after a move to Moscow. In 1928, she won the Moscow women's championship. She then moved to Leningrad, where she met and married scientist Lev Davidovich Goldstein; in 1931 they had a son. In Leningrad in 1929 she began training with chess master Peter Romanovsky. She won the Leningrad women's championship three times.\n\nIn World War II, Rudenko organized a train to evacuate children from the Siege of Leningrad. She described this as the most important accomplishment in her life.\n\nWomen's World Champion Vera Menchik died in 1944 during an air raid. After the war, in the winter of 1949–1950, the World Chess Federation FIDE held a tournament in Moscow to determine the new women's champion.

The first European to explore the district was Thomas Burr in September 1842. His promising reports soon led to occupation of the district by pastoralists, one of whom was Herbert Bristow Hughes (c. 1821 – 18 May 1892). When the present town was surveyed he named it for his wife, Laura née White (c. 1829 – 5 January 1909).\n\nLaura is administered by the Northern Areas Council, and is in the state electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey. It was formerly the council seat of the Corporate Town of Laura (1882-1932) and the District Council of Laura (1932-1988), as well as the District Council of Booyoolie (1876-1932), which covered the area surrounding the township.\n\nThe \"Laura Community Development and Tourism Association Incorporated\" liaises with the Northern Areas Council in preserving the amenity of the rural centre, with the support of many volunteers in community projects. The LCDTA's major project is operating the community-owned Laura Caravan Park. Profits from the caravan park operations are then used for improvements in the township.\n\nThe Spiny Daisy (Acanthocladium dockeri) was rediscovered in 1999 near Laura. The species, which was last seen in the South Australian Riverland in 1910, was found along a roadside.\n\nThe Laura Folk Fair is a two-day event held in April every year. There is no admission fee which makes the Folk Fair a family friendly outing. The Laura Country Music Festival has been held annually in July since 2011.\n\nLaura is famous as the home of Golden North ice cream which has been manufactured in the town since 1923 (the factory being the biggest employer in the district), and was a boyhood home of poet C. J. Dennis, whose first poem was published in the \"Laura Standard\" newspaper.\n\nThe Wilmington railway line was built from Gladstone railway station to Laura in 1884. It was extended from Laura in 1910 to Booleroo Centre, and finally to Wilmington in 1915. It closed in 1969.\n\nThe historic former Laura Courthouse in Hughes Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.\n\nBetween 1889 and 1948, Laura had its own newspaper, the Standard. Its first iteration, Laura Standard (subtitled: \"and Beetaloo, Wirrabara, Melrose, Booleroo Centre and Yarrowie Advertiser\") ran from 1889. In 1917 it merged with Crystal Brook Times to form Laura Standard and Crystal Brook Courier. In 1948, this newspaper then merged with Areas' Express and Agriculturist and Review to form Northern Review (later becoming The Flinders News).\n\n"}

The school was opened in 1956, to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding North Brisbane population whose children were members of the post-World War II baby boomer generation.\n\nKedron is a co-educational and non-denominational school, renowned in Brisbane for offering a Special Education Unit for hearing-impaired students and also for its accredited International Students Program.\n\nIn 2007 the school joined the Healthy State system and removed a large proportion of junk food including all soft drinks.\n\nKedron State High School is situated on 134 000 m² of land bordering Kedron Brook and Kedron Park. Originally inhabited by the Aboriginal Enoggera tribe, the site was also owned by Queensland's first Resident Judge, Alfred Lutwyche. From the 1880s onward it was used as a racecourse which was later partially owned by businessman John Wren in 1912.\n\nKedron was established in 1956; the school derives its name from a valley mentioned in the Bible and located in Palestine. Over the years, enrolment has ranged from 274 students in 1956 to 1700 in 1976. Since its inception, almost 20 000 students have attended Kedron. A language census conducted in 2003 revealed 38 languages were spoken within the school community.\n\nHalfway through each year, Kedron celebrates a week called 'Kedron Week' where for one week everyday, assemblies and activities are held to celebrate the many different activities the school holds. Also because the school is highly multi-cultural students from foreign countries greet the school on assembles in their own national language. Music, dancing, races, games and stories are usually put to show.\n\nIn 2006, Kedron celebrated their 50th anniversary.\n\nKedron is a traditional school which focusses primarily on scholastic excellence. Its students have achieved High Distinctions, Distinctions and Credits in Australasian Schools Competitions run by the University of New South Wales in English, Computer Science & Literacy, Science and Writing, and various other competitions. There have also been pupils selected to attend the National Youth Science Forum in Canberra and national winners in the National History Challenge.\n\nThere is also a strong focus on school-leavers' performance in statewide academic rankings; Kedron's Queensland Core Skills Test (QCS) preparation program has proven highly effective with 8 students in 2009 achieving an Overall Position (OP) of 1, the highest possible rank in the state.\n\nKedron also has a very strong focus on the arts. The music program in Kedron is very high achieving. In 1975, a Kedron band travelled to Longreach to play at the opening of the Stockman's Hall of Fame. They were followed 30 years later by a new generation of Kedron musicians to play at an anniversary celebration of the Hall's opening.\n\nAs of 2007, a Kedron student has become the third in three years to win the coveted Pierre de Coubertin Award for sporting excellence, an initiative of the Australian Olympic Committee.\n\n\n\n"}

In this episode, a \"telepathic infection\" sets the crew into two factions fighting against each other, with Major Kira leading the mutiny.\n\nMajor Kira believes a Valerian ship docked at the station is smuggling weapons to the Cardassians, but Commander Sisko refuses to detain the vessel without evidence. Before they can resolve their conflict, a damaged Klingon vessel arrives through the Wormhole. One of its crew transports aboard Deep Space Nine as the ship explodes. The bloodied man whispers, \"Victory!\" and dies within seconds. \n\nWhile investigating the explosion, Constable Odo suffers a seizure and collapses. When he awakens in the Infirmary, Dr. Bashir hints deviously at potential trouble between Kira and Sisko. By now, Kira has found evidence of foul play among the Valerians, and informs Sisko of her intention to confiscate their cargo; he forbids her from doing so.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt. Dax and Chief O'Brien take a runabout to find the Klingons' mission recorder and bring it back to the station. During their trip, O'Brien mentions the mounting tension and makes his loyalty to Sisko clear to a complacent Dax. Later, Kira attempts to win Dax's loyalty; however, Dax appears lethargic and only interested in reminiscing. Kira sees Quark attempting to eavesdrop, and violently attacks him.\n\nOdo attempts to warn Sisko of parallels between the apparent bloody mutiny on the Klingon ship and what is now happening on the station. Sisko, however, has begun meticulously constructing a clock and cannot be bothered. Soon Kira solicits Odo's help in a plan to eliminate Sisko and O'Brien. He pretends to go along with her. Meanwhile, O'Brien plots with Sisko to escape the station and return with reinforcements to overthrow Kira.\n\nOdo studies the Klingon log further, learning that the Klingons had discovered a collection of energy spheres with telepathic imprints of an ancient power struggle that destroyed a race known as the Saltah'na. Odo realizes that the imprint is affecting Deep Space Nine's senior staff, causing them to re-enact the power struggle that doomed the Saltah'na and the Klingon crew; Odo alone is unaffected. He visits Bashir again and pretends collaboration to coopt him into finding a way to reverse the imprint.\n\nBashir finds a way to remove the telepathic influence from the crew and Odo plays on the trust of both Kira and Sisko to lure both sides into one of the cargo bays. There, Odo activates Bashir's cure, and a purple gas-like cloud emerges from the officers, who regain their senses. Odo opens the cargo bay doors, venting the cloud into space and removing the telepathic imprint permanently.\n\n\n"}

Claude's best friend is Ellen (Tara Subkoff). Her plan to start a band with Ellen is subverted when Ellen begins dating Mark (Cole Hauser).\n\nClaude discovers that Luke (Pat Briggs), a gay musician who has just moved into her apartment building, has been stabbed to death in what might have been a hate crime. Ellen hints at the fact that she was there when Luke was killed, but Claude keeps her mouth shut in order to protect her. Claude then goes to a gay bar and meets Lucy (Leisha Hailey), a pink-haired guitarist who is playing in the house band.

The film premiered at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival where it played in the Panorama section. It went on to show at several festivals including the 1997 Turin International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and the 1998 Lisbon Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. It opened in American theaters on April 25, 1997, distributed by Fine Line Features. It was released in Australian theaters on February 19, 1998. It was released onto Region 1 DVD on June 14, 2005, distributed by Image Entertainment. It was released on Region 2 DVD on April 8, 2002, distributed by Millivres Multimedia.\n\nCritical response to \"All Over Me\" was generally positive. Rotten Tomatoes gives it an 86% approval rating based on 28 reviews, with an average score of 7.26/10. The site's consensus reads: \"\"All Over Me\" takes a serious, sensitive approach to teen lives and romantic relationships that are all too often ignored or misunderstood\".\n\nCritics were impressed with this directorial debut and described it as powerful and conspicuously well-made. They praised the Sichel sisters for telling a story of adolescence and friendship which is at once honest, realistic and authentic, while remaining subtle, subdued and compassionate. Emanuel Levy called it complex and interesting, and Marjorie Baumgarten called it a film for \"riot grrrls of all ages\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" praised it as a confident first feature but said that it has more style than substance. Its detractors included Don Willmot, who found it melodramatic, and \"E!\", which described it as titillating but contrived; \"a walk on the mild side\".\n\nAlison Folland was widely praised by critics for her performance as Claude. Emanuel Levy called her an instinctive actress who \"dominates every frame of the picture\". Janet Maslin said Folland brings a \"wistful sincerity\" to the role. Tara Subkoff was also praised for a performance compared by some to Rosanna Arquette. Not all the critics liked her portrayal of Ellen; \"E!\" called her \"merely grating\".\n\nWith its coming-of-age theme and exploration of teenage sexuality, \"All Over Me\" drew comparisons from critics to other films, in particular Larry Clark's \"Kids\" and Maria Maggenti's \"The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love\", both from 1995. Although similarities were noted, \"All Over Me\" was praised for its differences to these two films. \"E!\" called it gentler than \"Kids\", and Muskewitz said \"All Over Me\" was less exploitative than that film. Emanual Levy described it as the far more interesting and complex of the two. Ron Wells said \"thank god it's not \"Kids\"\" and Bernstein said that \"comparison misses the point\". When comparing it to \"The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love\", Emanuel Levy called \"All Over Me\" \"much more accomplished\". SplicedWire called it \" an ideal companion feature for Todd Solondz's \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\", another female-centred coming-of-age film from the mid-1990s.\n\n\"All Over Me\" won the Teddy Award for Best Feature Film at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival. It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, the Open Palm Award at the 1997 Gotham Awards and the Outstanding Film (Limited Release) Award at the 1998 GLAAD Media Awards. Alison Folland was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead.\n\nThe film score for \"All Over me\" was composed by Miki Navazio.

It is a naturally occurring red/yellow dye. It is formally derived from 9,10-anthraquinone by replacement of three hydrogen atoms by hydroxyl (OH) groups.\n\nPurpurin is also called verantin, smoke Brown G, hydroxylizaric acid, and C.I. 58205. It is a minor component of the classical lake pigment \"madder lake\" or Rose Madder.\n\nMadder root has been used for dying cloth at least since 1500 BC. Purpurin and alizarin were isolated from the root by Pierre Robiquet and Colin, two French chemists, in 1826. They were identified as anthracene derivatives by Gräbe and Liebermann in 1868. They also synthesized alizarin from bromoanthraquinone, which, together with the conversion of alizarin into purpurin published previously by M. F. De Lalande, provided the first synthetic route to purpurin. The positions of the OH groups were determined by Bayer and Caro in 1874–1875.\n\nPurpurin occurs in the roots of the madder plant (\"Rubia tinctorum\"), together with alizarin (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone). The root actually contains colorless glycosides of the dyes.\n\nPurpurin is a crystalline solid, that forms orange needles melting at , but becomes red when dissolved in ethanol, and yellow when dissolved with alkalis in boiling water. It is insoluble in hexane but soluble in chloroform, and can be obtained from chloroform as reddish needles. Unlike alizarin, purpurin is dissolved by boiling in a solution of aluminum sulfate, from which it can be precipitated by acid. This procedure can be used to separate the two dyes.\n\nLike many dihydroxy- and trihydroxyanthraquinones, pupurin has a purgative action, although only 1/20 as effective as 1,2,7-trihydroxyanthraquinone (anthrapurpurin).\n\nPurpurin is a fast dye for cotton printing and forms complexes with various metal ions. However it fades faster than alizarin on exposure to sunlight.\n\nA study published in \"Nature\" journal \"Scientific Reports\" suggests that the purpurin could replace cobalt in lithium-ion batteries. Eliminating cobalt would mean eliminating a hazardous material, allow batteries to be produced at room temperature, and lower the cost of recycling batteries. Extracting purpurin from farmed madder is a simple task; alternately, the chemical could be synthesized in a lab.\n\n"}

The island is accessible from the mainland at low tide by means of a causeway.\n\nThe castle is located in what was once the very volatile border area between England and Scotland. Not only did the English and Scots fight, but the area was frequently attacked by Vikings. The castle was built in 1550, around the time that Lindisfarne Priory went out of use, and stones from the priory were used as building material. It is very small by the usual standards, and was more of a fort. The castle sits on the highest point of the island, a whinstone hill called Beblowe.\n\nLindisfarne's position in the North Sea made it vulnerable to attack from Scots and Norsemen, and by Tudor times it was clear there was a need for a stronger fortification, although by this time the Norsemen were no longer a danger. This resulted in the creation of the fort on Beblowe Crag between 1570 and 1572 which forms the basis of the present castle.\nAfter Henry VIII suppressed the priory, his troops used the remains as a naval store. In 1542 Henry VIII ordered the Earl of Rutland to fortify the site against possible Scottish invasion. By December 1547, Ralph Cleisbye, Captain of the fort, had guns that included a wheel-mounted demi-culverin, 2 brass sakers, a falcon, and another fixed demi-culverin. However, Beblowe Crag itself was not fortified until 1549 and Sir Richard Lee saw only a decayed platform and turf rampart there in 1565. Elizabeth I then had work carried out on the fort, strengthening it and providing gun platforms for the new developments in artillery technology. These works in 1570 and 1571 cost £1191. When James I came to power in England, he combined the Scottish and English thrones, and the need for the castle declined. At this time the castle was still garrisoned from Berwick and protected the small Lindisfarne Harbour.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the castle was occupied briefly by Jacobite rebels, but was quickly recaptured by soldiers from Berwick who imprisoned the rebels; they dug their way out and hid for nine days close to nearby Bamburgh Castle before making good their escape.\nIn later years the castle was used as a coastguard look-out and became something of a tourist attraction. Charles Rennie Mackintosh made a sketch of the old fort in 1901.\n\nIn 1901, it became the property of Edward Hudson, a publishing magnate and the owner of \"Country Life\" magazine. He had it refurbished in the Arts and Crafts style by Sir Edwin Lutyens. It is said that Hudson and the architect came across the building while touring Northumberland and climbed over the wall to explore inside.\n\nThe walled garden, which had originally been the garrison's vegetable plot, was designed by Lutyens' long-time friend and collaborator, Gertrude Jekyll between 1906 and 1912. It is some distance away from the castle itself. Between 2002 and 2006 it was restored to Jekyll's original planting plan which is now held in the Reef Collection at the University of California, Berkeley. The castle, garden and nearby lime kilns have been in the care of the National Trust since 1944 and are open to visitors.\n\nLutyens used upturned disused boats (herring busses) as sheds. In 2005, two of the boats were destroyed by arson. They were replaced in 2006 and the third boat has now been renovated by the National Trust. The replacement of the two burned boats by two new boat sheds features on a DVD \"Diary of an Island\". This shows a fishing boat from Leith being cut in half in a boatyard in Eyemouth and the two \"sheds\" being transported to the island and lifted into place by crane.\n\nThe Spanish architect Enric Miralles used Lutyens' upturned herring busses as an inspiration for his design of the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh.\n\nThe castle was closed for major renovation and restoration works from November 2016 to April 2018.\n\nThe entrance to the castle is quite dramatic and involves a steep climb around the rocky base. Lutyens' original slope was unprotected by either rails or fences in an attempt to emphasise the exposed nature of the site. When the future George V and Queen Mary visited in 1908, it is said they were alarmed by the slope and the cobbled surface.\n\nOnce inside the castle, the entrance hall is sectioned off by large stone pillars, somewhat reminiscent of a church nave with the dark reddish-brown of the stone contrasting with the whitewashed plasterwork. The space is completed by a bare stone floor.\n\nThe kitchen is almost as bare, and is dominated by a large stone fireplace. Here, as at Castle Drogo, Lutyens uses the space in interesting ways. Throughout the castle, he has used stone, brick, slate and wood to create simple forms, and uses textures to demonstrate a rustic, spartan life-style. Despite being a castle it remains a homely space where the human scale is room size, but with incongruous architectural elements. In the scullery there is a tiny window over a stone sink surrounded by the mechanism used to operate the portcullis.\n\nAfter descending to the dining room one is inside the remnants of the Tudor fort. The vaults here and in the adjacent ship room are entirely functional as they support the gun battery above. The wide chimney-piece contains an old bread-oven; here Lutyens has emphasised the age of the room with Neo-Gothic traceried windows framed by curtains which swing out to lie flat along the wall. One of the end walls is painted a rich Prussian blue, which contrasts with the herring-bone patterned red-brick floor.\n\nNext door is the ship room where a green wall fulfils a similar role. The furniture is in keeping, with much dark wood in the tables and cabinets. The few upholstered chairs and sofas have now faded to gentle tones.\nThe largest bedroom, the east, is bright and airy and again has curtains on pull-out poles. The long gallery was a new space created by Lutyens, intended to echo the grand galleries of Elizabethan and Jacobean houses. The scale is much smaller, but again the use of exposed stone arches and oak beams provides a grand yet rustic feel.\nFurther on, an upper gallery has a raised platform at one end. From here an oak door leads onto the upper battery with its views along the coastline. The music room at the castle was used by Guilhermina Suggia, and a cello is left in the room today to mark her frequent visits.\n\nLindisfarne Castle has provided a shooting location for a number of films. Roman Polanski's 1966 \"Cul-de-sac\", starring Donald Pleasence, Lionel Stander and Françoise Dorléac, was shot entirely in and around the castle. It serves as the residence for Pleasence and Dorléac's characters. Polanski later returned to the castle to shoot scenes for his \"The Tragedy of Macbeth\" (1971), in which it stands in for Glamis Castle. The castle's use in \"Macbeth\" inspired the producers of the TV series \"Cold Feet\" (1998–2003) to use it as an exterior filming location in one episode, though interior scenes were shot at Hoghton Tower in Lancashire. It was also used as a stand-in for Mont San Pierre in the 1982 film \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" starring Anthony Andrews. In the British television show \"Wolfblood\", filming was done there for an episode. Some external shots of the castle are used in the fourth season of the period television drama \"Reign\".\n\n\n"}

They were record producer Phil Spector's first vocal group.\n\nFollowing graduation from Fairfax high school in Los Angeles, California, Phil Spector became obsessed with \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\", a song he had written for his group, the Teddy Bears. After a hasty audition at Era Records, which offered to finance a studio session, the Teddy Bears – Phil Spector, Marshall Leib, Harvey Goldstein (who left the group early on), lead singer Annette Kleinbard, and last minute recruit, drummer Sandy Nelson – recorded the song at Gold Star Studios at a cost of $75. Released on Era's Doré label in August 1958, it took two months before \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" began to get airplay.\n\nIt went on to become a global hit. The record stayed in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for 23 weeks, in the Top Ten for 11 of those weeks, and commanded the number 1 chart position for three weeks. It also reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. It sold over two and a half million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. At 19 years old, Spector had written, arranged, played, sung, and produced the best-selling record in the country. Although subsequent releases by the Teddy Bears on the Imperial label were well-recorded soft pop, they did not sell, and within a year of the debut, Spector disbanded the group. Their demise was hastened by Kleinbard being seriously injured in 1960 in a car accident.\n\nSpector was not the only Teddy Bear who went on to a career after the group broke up. Harvey Goldstein became a certified public accountant. Annette Kleinbard continued to write and record songs, and changed her name to Carol Connors. Among her credits are the Rip Chords hit \"Hey Little Cobra\", and the Academy Awards nominated \"Rocky\" theme song, \"Gonna Fly Now,\" co-written with Ayn Robbins. Leib joined the Hollywood Argyles, played guitar on some of Duane Eddy's records and produced material recorded by the Everly Brothers amongst others.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1958\n1959\n\n"}

The lyric \"I'm a new day rising\" is a reference to the album \"New Day Rising\" by Hüsker Dü, one of Grohl's favorite groups.\n\n\"Times Like These\" is in D Mixolydian mode and the section that begins at 0:13 is in 7/4 time. The chorus of the song is also grouped in bars of 3 rather than the regular bars of 4. Somewhat unusually, the song intro starts in 8/4 time for 4 bars, then switches to 7/4 for 8 bars and then 6 bars of 8/4 again before leading into the first verse, which is also in 8/4. It is set at 145 BPM.\n\nAfter the album version ended its run on the charts, a solo acoustic version of the song performed by Grohl was released and had some success on pop and adult contemporary radio but generally it enjoyed great success on rock and alternative radio just like the original electric version.\n\nTwo music videos were made for the studio version of the song and a third music video was made for an acoustic version of the song. All 3 versions were made available via the DVD release \"Low/Times Like These\"(2003):\n\nDirected by Liam Lynch. The band is shown performing the song against changing backgrounds, consisting mainly of brightly colored kaleidoscopic forms similar to those found in music visualization, giving the video a psychedelic, hopeful, joyful mood. In the end, the backgrounds blink out to reveal that the band are performing against a greenscreen in a studio. This version is often referred to as the \"UK version\" and received little airplay in the US as the band ultimately opted to film another video shortly afterwards.\n\nDirected by Marc Klasfeld. The video was shot on the Mojave River Bridge in Victorville, CA and shows the band performing the song on location, below and in front of a bridge. A girl wanders onto the bridge and eventually tosses her Game Boy Advance at them. Gradually, more and more people arrive at the bridge and start throwing other inanimate objects (including appliances, instruments, and furniture) behind and around the oblivious band members. The items never hit any of them, though they come close. The actions of the participants would suggest that their motivations and intentions are to cast off the material trappings of society which prohibit them from living freely.\n\nTwo cars are then simultaneously dropped off the bridge and behind the band, resulting in clouds of smoke and fire. This is followed by an entire house (only with walls and roof) being dropped onto the band by a crane, and the walls falling onto the ground without anyone getting hurt. A continuity error occurs at the end: when the house falls apart, the roof is missing.\n\nSome of the extras featured in the video were fans selected through the band's official web site.\n\nA music video was produced for the acoustic version. It consists solely of clips of Grohl recording the song's vocal, guitar, and piano tracks in the studio. It was co-directed by Grohl and Bill Yukich.\n\n\nThe acoustic version of this song was used in episode 20 of season 4 (\"The Birth and Death of the Day\") of \"One Tree Hill\" during the graduation scene, which is also when Haley's water breaks.\n\nThis is also used as the theme song for a video montage showing memorable past goals at Turf Moor for all of Burnley FC's home games from 2009 to the present.\n\nIt was used by George W. Bush for his 2004 re-election campaign without the band's knowledge. \"That was weird,\" Grohl remarked. \"And to me it just seemed like a pretty good example of how completely out of touch he was. You read those lyrics: they're about hope and love and compassion. And look at his administration: war and fear and death. It was laughable. You couldn't have picked a worse song. That's why I jumped on the John Kerry campaign. I thought, 'I guess the right thing to do is to go play the song where it's needed – where it makes sense.'\"\n\nThe acoustic version was used at the end of episode 21 (\"Coalition of the Willing\") of the American television series \"Jericho\".\n\nThe acoustic version was used by the Calgary Flames during their 2003–04 NHL season cup run, for their opening.\n\nIt was released as a \"Rock Band\" and \"Rock Band 2\" DLC track on Xbox Live and PSN on December 23, 2008.\n\nIt was featured in the 2003 film \"American Wedding\".\n\nThe song and the acoustic version were both featured in the 2012 ESPY Awards in a montage to commemorate the past 20 years in sports.\n\n\"Times Like These\" was featured in the 2007 annual \"WWE Tribute to the Troops\".\n\nThe Washington Nationals Radio Network plays part of the track as the bridge to the post-game show after any game the Nationals win.\n\nAn acoustic cover version of the song appears in a Sprint/T-Mobile commercial as of March 2020.\n\nEnhanced Section (\"Nice Hat\")\n<br>Enhanced Section (\"Back Slapper\")\n\nEnhanced section (\"Japanese Grunge\")\n\n\n\n\nAs a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, BBC Radio 1 organised the \"biggest ever\" Live Lounge cover version as part of their \"Stay at Home\" project. The track was produced by Fraser T. Smith and was performed by the charity supergroup Live Lounge Allstars. Each member recorded and filmed their contribution to the song from their respective households in order to encourage social distancing. The song was released on 23 April 2020 and the video premiered as part of The Big Night In telethon. Among various charities worldwide, profits from the single will primarily go to Children in Need and Comic Relief, as well as WHO's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Within 12 hours of the song's initial release, it gained 43,000 digital downloads and entered the top 5 on the UK Singles Chart. The song reached number 1 on its second week, earning 66,000 chart sales (78% of which were downloads). This song also became the first song produced by BBC Radio 1 to top the chart, and the first BBC release to peak at number-one since \"Perfect Day\" in 1997.

{"id": "2298292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298292", "title": "Hackney Wick", "text": "Hackney Wick\n\nHackney Wick is a suburb in the London Borough of Hackney and Tower Hamlets in east London, England. It part of the district called Hackney, the administrative centre for the borough. It is about 4.2 miles (6.8 km) northeast of Charing Cross and had a population of approximately 11,734 at the 2011 Census.\n\nHackney Wick is in the far east of the borough, at the southern tip of Hackney Marshes, and includes part of 2012 Olympic Park, west of the River Lea in the Lower Lea Valley, where it abuts Waltham Forest and Newham. West of the River Lea, the Lee Navigation, here called Hackney Cut, meets the Hertford Union Canal.\n\nIn Roman times the River Lea was a wide, fast flowing river, and the tidal estuary stretched as far as Hackney Wick. In 894, a force of Danes sailed up the river to Hertford; Alfred the Great saw an opportunity to defeat the Danes and ordered the lower reaches of the Lea drained, at Leamouth. This left the Danes' boats stranded, but also increased the flow of the river and caused the tidal head to move downriver to Old Ford.\n\nPrior to 'modern times', Hackney Wick was an area prone to periodic flooding. The construction of the canals and relief channels on the Lea alleviated that and allowed the development of the area. In historic times, the marshes were used extensively for grazing cattle, and there was limited occupation around the 'great house' at Hackney Wick. This area as well as the marshes were historically part of Lower Homerton.\n\nDuring the 19th and (early) 20th centuries, the Wick was a thriving well-populated industrial zone, as the Hackney Wick First World War memorial in Victoria Park testifies (see picture right) —the lower part of the obelisk is densely inscribed on all four faces with the names of Wick men who died in that conflict. When Charles Booth surveyed Hackney Wick in his London-wide survey of poverty during the 1890s he would have noticed that there were, amid the noxious fumes and noise, areas of lessened deprivation. Streets south of the railway such as Wansbeck and Rothbury Roads were a mixture of comfort and poverty. Kelday Road, right on the canal seemed positively middle class. To the north of the railway, streets either side of Wick Road, e.g. Chapman Road, Felstead Street and Percy Terrace were described as \"very poor\", with \"chronic want\".\n\nIt was no doubt conditions such as these which hastened the involvement of Eton College about this time to instigate their urban mission in Hackney Wick, a philanthropic and perhaps more accurately pedagogical outreach shared with several other public schools. The Eton Mission lasted from 1880 to 1971 when the college decided that a more local social project was appropriate for changed times, and has left as legacy a fine church by G. F. Bodley, a noted rowing club, and the 59 Club.\n\nIn the last quarter of the eighteenth century, water mills on the Hackney Brook were adapted for the manufacturer of silk, and in particular crêpe. In 1811, it was said that 'the works at these mills are moved by two steam engines, on an improved principle, which set in motion 30,000 spindles, besides numerous other implements of machinery used in the manufacture.'\n\nThe world's first true synthetic plastic, parkesine, invented by Alexander Parkes, was manufactured here from 1866 to 1868, though Parkes' company failed due to high production costs. In contrast shellac, a natural polymer was manufactured at the Lea Works by A.F. Suter and Co. at the Victory Works for many years. The factory at nos 83/4 Eastway commenced operation in 1927. Subsequently, they relocated to Dace Road in Bow. For many years Hackney Wick was the location of the oil distiller Carless, Capel & Leonard, credited with introduction of the term petrol in the 1890s. The distinguished chemist and academic Sir Frederick Warner (1910 - 2010) worked at Carless's Hackney Wick factory from 1948–1956. William J Leonard (1857–1923) was followed by his son Julian Mayard Leonard (1900–1978) into the firm, where he became managing director and deputy chairman.\n\nThe firm of Brooke Simpson Spiller at Atlas Works in Berkshire Road had taken over the firm of William Henry Perkin at Greenford Green near Harrow in 1874, but subsequently disposed of some operations to Burt Bolton Heywood in Silvertown. Nevertheless, Brooke Simpson Spiller is the successor company to the founding father of the British Dyestuff Industry. The company employed the brilliant organic chemist Arthur George Green (1864–1941) from 1885 until 1894, when he left to join the Clayton Aniline Company in Manchester and ultimately, when the British chemical industry failed his talents, to the chair of Colour Chemistry at Leeds University. At Hackney Wick, Green discovered the important dyestuff intermediate Primuline. He was a contemporary of the organic chemist Richard John Friswell (1849–1908) who was from 1874 a research chemist, and from 1886 until 1899 director and chemical manager. Perhaps even more distinguished was the Jewish chemist, Professor Raphael Meldola FRS, who is remembered for Meldola's Blue dye and is commemorated by the Royal Society of Chemistry's Meldola Medal. He worked at Hackney Wick from 1877 until 1885, where Meldola's Blue was discovered. Friswell went on to succeed Armstrong as Professor of Chemistry at Finsbury Technical College. Friswell eventually left Hackney Wick to work for the British Uralite Company at Higham although he was still a director there in 1893 when he wrote to H.E. Armstrong to describe bad trading conditions at Atlas Works. A large collection of Hackney made dyestuffs is on view at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney Australia. The firm of W.C.Barnes of the Phoenix Works was also engaged in the aniline dye industry at Hackney Wick.\n\nThe confectioner Clarnico is synonymous with Hackney Wick. The company, known as Clarke, Nickolls, Coombs until 1946, arrived in Hackney Wick in 1879. Despite being taken over by Trebor Bassett, the name lives on in Bassett's Clarnico Mint Creams and also in the CNC Property company. Just after the second world war, Clarnico was the largest confectioner in Britain but moved further across the Lea to Waterden Road in 1955 where it survived for another 20 years. The company had its own brass band in the early 20th century.\n\nAnother pathfinding entrepreneur in Hackney Wick was the Frenchman, Eugene Serre. His father, Achille Serre, who had settled in Stoke Newington, introduced dry cleaning to England. Eugene expanded the business into a former tar factory in White Post Lane which still carries traces of the firm's name.\n\nIn post-industrial times, Hackney Wick has seen many changes to its topography. Very little remains of the inter-war street pattern between the Hertford Union Canal and Eastway (the western part was then known as Gainsborough Road) or the masses of small terraced houses. Many of the street names have permanently vanished due to later redevelopment. Part of the Wick was redeveloped in the 1960s to create the Greater London Council's Trowbridge Estate, which consisted of single-storey modern housing at the foot of seven 21-storey tower blocks. The estate's housing conditions deteriorated quickly and despite an attempt to regenerate the tower blocks, much of the housing in the estate was replaced between 1985 and 1996. The artist Rachel Whiteread made screenprints of photographs of the former Trowbridge estate which are in the Tate Collection as part of her series \"Demolished\".\n\nThe Atlas Works of 1863, backing onto the Lee Navigation, was demolished to make way for housing in the 1990s. In the 1930s it had been the home of the British Perforated Paper Co, famous for inventing toilet paper in 1880.\n\nDue to its proximity to the Olympic Park, Hackney Wick received community and public realm development grants. The Draft Phase 1 Hackney Wick Area Action Plan was developed for consultation in November 2009 by Hackney Council as a strategy to guide and manage future change in the area. The updated Area Action Plan was adopted in 2012. This should further contribute to improvements in the area, although there are fears that development may price many residents, particularly artists, out of the area.\n\nConversely, concerns have been raised over some of the local effects of the Olympic Park development, including the potential impact to the future of the century-old Manor Garden Allotments, which has inspired a vocal community campaign.\n\nIn 2011 the ward that represented the Hackney Wick area was the Wick ward. As of the 2011 UK census, Hackney Wick had a total population of 11,734, with an area of 163.26 hectares and a density of 71.9 persons per hectare. Of the 4,802 households in Hackney Wick, 17.0% were married or same-sex civil partnership couples living together, 36.5% were one-person households, 8.6% were co-habiting couples and 19.4% were lone parents.\n\nIn 2011 the largest ethnic group is White (48.4%), followed by Black or Black British (31.8%), Mixed (11.1%) and Asian or British Asian (8.7%). The remaining 4.4 per cent is made up of other unspecified ethnic groups. As for religion, in 2011 50.4% of residents identified as Christian, 12.7% as Muslim, 1.5% as Buddhist, 1.0% as Jewish, 0.5% as Sihk, 0.4% as Hindu, 0.4% having an unspecified religion, 8.1% not stating their religion, and 25.1% having no religion.\n\nHackney Wick has a long been home to a large number of professional creatives, artists and musicians. Attracted in part by the low cost studio spaces that became available with the decline of its industrial past, more than 600 individual artist studios existed in 2013. With notable artists including Banksy, Paul Noble and Fantich and Young\n\nThe area has also a number of established creative arts venues with the Schwartz Gallery, Stour Space, The Yard micro theatre, and the artists collectives such as the Performance Space, and the White Building, London's centre for art, technology and sustainability which was developed in partnership with the London Legacy Development Corporation and is occupied by Space Studios.\n\nFollowing the Olympic Games in 2012, Hackney Wick has seen the onset of rapid gentrification in part due to the opening of new residential locations within the Olympic legacy site but also specifically the artist culture which has been long established in recent history.\n\nFurther along the Eastway, the 2012 Olympic site claimed industrial premises formerly used by British Industrial Gases (later British Oxygen Company, BOC) to manufacture oxygen and acetylene and Setright Registers Limited who, between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, made the famous bus ticket issuing Setright Machine used throughout the UK and abroad.\n\nThe historic Hackney Wick Stadium, well known throughout the East End for greyhound racing and speedway, became derelict in the late 1990s and closed in 2003. However, it became the site for the 2012 Olympic media and broadcast centre and, after the Games, was to be turned over for commercial use.\n\nThere are many other signs of revival. Not only will the area benefit from the 2012 Olympics development, but London's artistic community, increasingly forced out of the old warehousing and industrial zones to the south of Hackney borough and in Tower Hamlets by rising rents, are taking an interest in the more affordable industrial buildings out at the Wick. Though rents rose through 2011 and 2012 because of the upcoming Olympics. Hackney Wick's first arts festival, \"Hackney Wicked,\" took place from the 8 to 10 August 2008. The festival weekend included show openings from a series of the Wick's local art venues, including Mother Studios, Elevator Gallery, The Residence, Decima Gallery, Schwartz Gallery, Show Dome, Mainyard Gallery, Top and Tail Gallery, The Peanut Factory and Wallis Studios. 2009 saw the staging of a second 'Hackney Wicked' arts festival, which took place from Friday 29 July to Sunday 1 August. The Festival had the 4th edition in 2011, taking place between 29 July and 31 July where you can watch a film of its true spirit. In September 2012, Hackney Film Festival curated an outdoor canal-side screening of Andrew Kötting and Iain Sinclair's olympic sized travelogue ‘Swandown’, with a Q&A session at Carlton London during the closing ceremony of the Paralympics. The evening was hosted by Gareth Evans in association with the Mayor of London.\n\nThe notable 59 Club for motorcyclists was founded at the Eton Mission church in 1959 in Hackney Wick.\n\nHackney Wick is mentioned in an exchange of dialogue in \"The Ribos Operation\", a 1978 episode of \"Doctor Who\", as being a \"mudpatch in the middle of nowhere\" that one of the characters longs to return to.\n\nHackney Wick railway station is served by London Overground services on the North London line. The station is near the scene of the first \"railway murder\". The victim, Thomas Briggs of 5 Clapton Square, was returning from dining with his niece in Peckham in July 1864 and had the misfortune to meet his murderer on the train.\n\nVictoria Park railway station was on the North London Railway to Poplar, which closed to passengers in 1943 and to goods in the early 1980s. It was on the site of the present East Cross Route and opened in 1866 at the former junction of the Stratford and Poplar lines, replacing a short-lived station of 1856 on the north side of Wick Lane (now Wick Road). No trace of either remains. The redundant viaduct carrying the former goods line to the Millwall docks over the East Cross Route was removed in the 1990s. The present Hackney Wick railway station was built on the 1854 spur from the original North London Line to Stratford. The entrance poles to the former Hackney Wick Goods and Coal Depot (a site now occupied by housing) are still to be seen beside the Kenworthy Road bridge.\n\nThe local area is well served by seven daytime bus routes and one nighttime route, with three of the routes terminating at Hackney Wick. With the area having access to London bus routes 26, 30, 236, 276, 339, 388, 488 and N26, Hackney Wick has connections to areas of Central London and other areas such as Stratford.\n\nHackney Wick is connected to the National Road Network, with the A12 Eastway (completed late 1990s), and East Cross Route linking the area with the Blackwall Tunnel (1960s).\n\nHackney Wick is on the Capital Ring walking route, much of which is accessible to cyclists. The River Lee Navigation, and other local canals, have a tow path which is accessible for both walking and cycling. The Hertford Union Canal is accessed via a ramp from Wick Road, near St Marks Gate. From here, eastward, the Lea Valley Walk provides a continuous route to Hertfordshire for the particularly determined, the National Cycle Route 1 also runs on both towpaths connecting Hackney Wick to the National Cycle Network.

The defendant may question both the memory of the witness (suggesting, for example, that the identification is the result of a false memory), and the perception of the witness (suggesting, for example, that the witness had poor eyesight, or that the crime occurred in a poorly lit place).\n\nBecause the prosecution in a criminal case must prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant must convince the jury that there is reasonable doubt about whether the witness actually saw what he or she claims to have seen, or recalls having seen. Although scientific studies have shown that mistaken identity is a common phenomenon, jurors give very strong credence to eyewitness testimony, particularly where the eyewitness is resolute in believing that their identification of the defendant was correct.\n\nResearchers like Elizabeth Loftus have challenged eyewitness testimony based on the fact that people's memory can be distorted. In her study she questioned eyewitnesses about a videotape of a car accident. Witnesses were asked \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" However, some witnesses were asked the same question with the verb \"hit\" replaced by the verb \"smashed\". Those who were asked the question with \"smashed\" as the verb said the cars were moving faster than those who were asked the same question with the verb \"hit.\" Additionally, when asked if there was broken glass at the scene, those who heard \"smashed\" were more likely to say there was than those who heard \"hit.\" There was no broken glass in the videotape. Hers is only one example of studies that show memory can be susceptible to distortions.\n\nWith genetic fingerprinting and DNA evidence now commonplace, many convictions based on eyewitness testimony are being re-examined. According to statistics, over 75% of the cases of DNA exonerations have involved mistaken eyewitness identification.\n\nAbraham Lincoln used mistaken identity as a defense for William \"Duff\" Armstrong in 1858. He referred to a farmer's almanac to prove that a witness could not have seen Armstrong in the moonlight, as claimed, because the position of the moon that night would not have provided sufficient illumination. Armstrong was acquitted.\n\nA famous case of mistaken identity in the United Kingdom is the case of Adolf Beck, who served several years in prison as a swindler, was released upon completion of his sentence, and then arrested again on the same charges before the actual swindler of similar appearance was apprehended.\n\nAnother case demonstrating mistaken identity is the case of American Ronald Cotton. In 1984, Jennifer Thompson was raped. During the attack, she studied the attacker's face, determined to identify him if she survived the attack. When presented with a photo lineup, she identified Cotton as her attacker. Twice, she testified against him by saying she had identified him. When presented with Bobby Poole, an inmate who boasted to fellow inmates that he had committed the crimes for which Cotton was convicted, she said she had never seen him before. After Cotton served 10.5 years of his sentence, attorneys arranged for DNA testing of him and Poole. Poole's DNA matched that collected from Thompson's rape kit, proving that he had raped her. \n\nThompson has since become a critic of eyewitness testimony because of its proven unreliability. She was filled with remorse after learning that she had contributed to Cotton, an innocent man, being convicted and sent to prison. Upon release for wrongful conviction (proved by DNA analysis), Cotton was awarded $109,150.69 in compensation from the state of North Carolina. Cotton and Thompson have reconciled and become close friends; they conduct speaking tours to promote reform of procedures for eyewitness testimony.\n\nAfter Cotton was released, Poole was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to raping Thompson. She wrote to him but he never responded. He died in prison in 2000.\n\nThe SODDI defense (\"Some Other Dude Did It\" or \"Some Other Dude Done It\") is often used when there is no question that a crime occurred, such as in murder or assault cases, where the defendant is not asserting self-defense. The SODDI defense in a murder, rape or assault case is often accompanied by a mistaken identity defense and/or an alibi defense. Another common scenario where the SODDI defense is available is where the police find contraband in a car or residence containing multiple people. In this scenario, each person present could assert that one of the other people possessed the contraband.\n\nThe defense does carry a risk: It may be legal in some jurisdictions to falsely assert one's innocence while it is illegal to falsely blame another person for the crime.\n\nIn \"Holmes v. South Carolina\", 547 U.S. 319, 126 S. Ct. 1727, 1731, 164 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2006), the US Supreme Court held that a South Carolina statute that prohibited putting on a SODDI defense when the state's case was \"strong\" violated the Sixth Amendment right to put on a defense.\n\n\n\n"}

During 1964–69 he was lead singer of Sydney-based rock and roll band the Easybeats, widely regarded as the greatest Australian pop band of the 1960s.\n\nEarly hits for the Easybeats were co-written by Wright with bandmate George Young, including, \"She's So Fine\" (No. 3, 1965), \"Wedding Ring\" (No. 7, 1965), \"Women (Make You Feel Alright)\" (No. 4, 1966), \"Come and See Her\" (No. 3, 1966), \"I'll Make You Happy\" (track on \"Easyfever\" EP, No. 1, 1966), and \"Sorry\" (No. 1, 1966). He was lead vocalist on their only international hit, \"Friday on My Mind\", which peaked at No. 1 in Australia in 1966. It also made No. 6 in the United Kingdom, the Top 10 in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, No.13 in Canada, and the Top 20 in the United States in 1967.\n\nAfter the Easybeats disbanded in 1969, Wright fronted numerous groups including Stevie Wright Band and Stevie Wright & the Allstars; his solo career included the 1974 single, \"Evie (Parts 1, 2 & 3)\", which peaked at No. 1 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Wright had problems with alcohol and drug addictions. By 1976 he was hospitalised and undertook methadone treatment. In the late 1970s he was treated at Chelmsford Private Hospital by Harry Bailey who administered deep sleep therapy with a combination of drug-induced coma and electroshock.\n\nWright's life was detailed in two biographies, \"Sorry: The Wretched Tale of Little Stevie Wright\" by Jack Marx (1999) and \"Hard Road: The Life and Times of Stevie Wright\" by Glenn Goldsmith (2004). On 14 July 2005, the Easybeats, with Wright as a member, were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.\n\nWright was born in Leeds, England, United Kingdom in 1947 to George Wright and Dorothy Wright (née Longden); his family migrated to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, when he was nine. They moved to Sydney in 1960 and lived in Villawood near the Villawood Migrant Hostel. He was lead vocalist for local band, The Outlaws, and by 1964 had formed Chris Langdon & the Langdells, which initially played The Shadows-styled surf music but converted to beat music under the influence of The Beatles.\n\nAfter a Langdells performance, Wright met the Dutch-born Johannes Hendrikus Jacob van den Berg (later Harry Vanda), who was staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel, and his compatriot Dingeman van der Sluys (later Dick Diamonde). This introduction was arranged by their first manager, Alan Kissick. The pair convinced Wright to form a band with Vandenberg's friend and fellow hostel resident Scottish-born George Young. Together with another Englishman, Gordon \"Snowy\" Fleet, they formed the Easybeats in mid-1964. The initial line-up of the Easybeats was Diamonde on bass guitar, Fleet on drums, Vanda on guitar, Wright on vocals and Young on guitar.\n\nDuring his time with the Easybeats, Wright was popularly and affectionately known as \"Little Stevie\". Early hits for the Easybeats were co-written by Wright with bandmate Young, including, \"She's So Fine\" (No. 3, 1965), \"Wedding Ring\" (No. 7, 1965), \"Women (Make You Feel Alright)\" (No. 4, 1966), \"Come and See Her\" (No. 3, 1966), \"I'll Make You Happy\" (track on \"Easyfever\" EP, No. 1, 1966), and \"Sorry\" (No. 1, 1966).\n\nHe was lead vocalist on their only international hit \"Friday on My Mind\", which peaked at No. 1 in Australia in 1966. It made No. 6 in UK, Top 10 in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Italy and Top 20 in the US in 1967. In 2001, the song was voted the Best Australian Song of All Time by the Australasian Performing Right Association, Wright was renowned for his energetic stage performance, which included acrobatic back-flips and mod dance moves. The Easybeats disbanded in UK in 1969 with Vanda & Young becoming freelance musicians, songwriters and producers.\n\nAside from tracks for the Easybeats, Wright and George Young also wrote \"Step Back\" for Johnny Young (no relation) and his band Kompany, released in May 1966, which peaked at No. 1.\n\nAfter the break-up of the Easybeats in 1969, Wright returned to Sydney from UK, and he formed a backing group, Rachette. He produced the debut single for local band Bootleg, \"Whole World Should Slow Down\", in 1970. By late 1971, he was in Perth and joined Likefun with Ray Hoff on vocals (ex-Off Beats), Morri Pierson on vocals, Shirley Reid on vocals, John Tucak on bass guitar and Alan Wilks on organ. He soon returned to Sydney and from mid-1972 took the role of Simon Zealotes in the Australian stage production of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". Also in 1972, he joined Black Tank with Rory O'Donoghue on guitar and vocals (ex-The Pogs), Ken Firth on bass guitar (Tully) and Greg Henson on drums (Levi Smith Clefs).\n\nWright signed with Albert Productions label in late 1973 which reunited him with former bandmates Vanda & Young who had returned from UK and were now staff producers and songwriters. Wright formed Stevie Wright & the Allstars for live performances, the line-up included, Johnny Dick on drums (ex-Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs), Tim Gaze on lead guitar (Tamam Shud, Kahvas Jute, Ariel), and Warren Morgan on piano (Chain, Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs). In April 1974 he released his debut solo LP, \"Hard Road\", which featured the single \"Evie (Parts 1, 2 & 3)\" released in May. The song was written and produced by Vanda & Young, it became a hit—the only 11-minute song to chart at No. 1 anywhere in the world— and is now regarded as an Australian rock classic. Part 1 is subtitled, \"Let Your Hair Hang Down\", and part 3 is \"I'm Losing You\". Wright performed three concerts at the Sydney Opera House with backing by Vanda, Young and AC/DC's Malcolm Young (George Young's brother). Another Vanda & Young produced LP, \"Black-eyed Bruiser\", followed in 1975, but it failed to chart in the Top 50. By mid-1975, the Allstars had transferred to John Paul Young (no relation) and Wright formed the Stevie Wright Band with Tony Bolton on drums (Aesop's Fables, Country Radio), Larry Duryea on percussion (Tamam Shud), Russell Johnson on guitar (Mississippi, Country Radio), Billy Rylands on bass guitar (Lotus) and Peter White on keyboards.\n\nBy 1976 Wright was addicted to heroin, which he had reportedly begun using during his time in the cast of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". He was hospitalised and undertook methadone treatment. His mental health suffered further after his self-admission to Chelmsford Private Hospital. A psychiatrist, Harry Bailey, administered a highly-controversial treatment, Deep Sleep Therapy, which was alleged to treat drug addiction by a combination of drug-induced coma and electroconvulsive therapy. Many patients, including Wright, suffered brain damage and lifelong after effects. The scandal was later exposed, and Bailey committed suicide.\n\nIn 1982, Wright joined Vanda & Young in their studio band, Flash and the Pan, to provide vocals on their album, \"Headlines\" and the related singles, \"Where were You?\" in July, and \"Waiting for a Train\" in December. The same year, there was talk of an Easybeats' reunion. Wright told Juke Magazine in 1983 that they \"had our lawyers working out the deal\" because there was a venue interested in having them \"but at the last minute they tried to change the venue and we just said 'forget it'.\"\n\nIn 1983, there was a talk of a solo album with work done again with Vanda and Young. Wright said the album would best be described as \"classy rock 'n' roll\", and the songs were about \"a wide spectrum of all the experiences I've been through\". He said the love songs he had were optimistic. The interview gives a good idea as to how Wright worked in the studio with Vanda and Young:;\"Well, it's a three way thing. They'll sit down and say 'we've got this sort of song' and we'll discuss how we'll approach it. Obviously after this long we do have a very strong bond. I've written a couple of songs but since they're far better at it than I am, I'll let them handle that.\" According to the Juke Magazine article it was \"due for release later that year\"; however, this never happened.\n\nIn January 1984, Wright was charged with attempted housebreaking, days after attending Westmount drug rehabilitation centre. He was arrested for heroin use later that month. He had been using heroin since about 1973, and, according to Wright, he remained an addict for 20 years. The Easybeats reformed for a brief Australian tour in 1986, and Wright re-formed variations of the Stevie Wright Band in 1986–88. Wright's substance abuse problems continued into the 1980s and 1990s and he came close to death on several occasions but was supported by his partner, Fay Walker. His meteoric rise and fall has made him a frequent media subject. In 1999, journalist Jack Marx published a much-anticipated biography, \"Sorry - The Wretched Tale of Little Stevie Wright\". It was critically applauded by some reviewers. Australian music historian Clinton Walker called it \"gonzo journalism at its best\". \"The Bulletin\" later referred to \"Sorry\" as \"one of the most harrowing rock books ever written\". \"Sorry\" was dismissed by Wright, his fans and other critics. Internet reviewer Ken Grady (\"Luna Kafé\", 1999) described Marx as \"a self serving hypocrite\" and concluded his review by observing: \"The only thing that Marx has achieved is to depict himself as a very unlikeable, morally bankrupt leech.\" \n\n\"Long Way to the Top\" was a 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) six-part documentary on the history of Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. \"Episode 2: Ten Pound Rocker\", broadcast on 22 August, featured interviews with Harry Vanda and Johnny Young. Vanda described meeting George Young; while Johnny Young (no relation) described how Wright wrote the lyrics for \"Step Back\". During August 2002, promoters Michael Chugg and Kevin Jacobsen, organised a related concert tour, Long Way to the Top. Wright had seriously injured his ankle in a fall and so concerts had him performing \"Evie\", with The Allstars, while seated on a stool. Performances at two Sydney concerts in September were recorded, broadcast on ABC-TV and subsequently released on DVD in December. His authorised biography, \"Hard Road: The Life and Times of Stevie Wright\", by Glenn Goldsmith was published in 2004. As of 2001, Wright lived near Canberra with his partner Fay Walker, and he had a son, Nicholas, born in 1972 or 1973.\n\nOn 14 July 2005, the Easybeats, with Wright as a member, were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame alongside Renée Geyer, Hunters & Collectors, Smoky Dawson, Split Enz and Normie Rowe.\n\nOn 31 January 2009, Wright headlined the Legends of Rock festival in Byron Bay. Songs played included \"Sorry\", \"I'll Make You Happy\", \"Evie (part 2)\", \"Friday on My Mind\", \"She's So Fine\" and \"Wedding Ring\". He was interviewed for the Macquarie Regional Radioworks program \"Sunday Groovies\", by Kym Ferguson, on 11 February. He reported that 2009 was an exciting and busy year with new material and previously unreleased tracks expected.\n\nWright retired and lived on the South Coast of New South Wales. He died on 27 December 2015 at Moruya Hospital of pneumonia. Wright's funeral was held at St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney on 8 January 2016.\n\n\nThe Easybeats\nFlash and the Pan\nStevie Wright, Stevie Wright Band, Stevie Wright & the Allstars\n\n\n"}

Analysis results for an individual plant are generalised to the standard surface, e.g. the leaf area index is the projected surface area of all crop leaves above a unit area of ground.\n\nThe usual system of describing plant production divides the plant production process into at least five separate processes, which are influenced by several external parameters.\n\nTwo cycles of biochemical reactions constitute the basis of plant production, the light reaction and the dark reaction.\n\n\nImportant parameters in theoretical production models thus are:\n\n\n\n\nTheoretical production ecology assumes that the growth of common agricultural crops, such as cereals and tubers, usually consists of four (or five) phases: \n\n\nPlant production models exist in varying levels of scope (cell, physiological, individual plant, crop, geographical region, global) and of generality: the model can be crop-specific or be more generally applicable. In this section the emphasis will be on crop-level based models as the crop is the main area of interest from an agronomical point of view.\n\nAs of 2005, several crop production models are in use. The crop growth model SUCROS has been developed during more than 20 years and is based on earlier models. Its latest revision known dates from 1997. The IRRI and Wageningen University more recently developed the rice growth model ORYZA2000. This model is used for modeling rice growth. Both crop growth models are open source. Other more crop-specific plant growth models exist as well.\n\nSUCROS is programmed in the Fortran computer programming language. The model can and has been applied to a variety of weather regimes and crops. Because the source code of Sucros is open source, the model is open to modifications of users with FORTRAN programming experience.\nThe official maintained version of SUCROS comes into two flavours: SUCROS I, which has non-inhibited unlimited crop growth (which means that only solar radiation and temperature determine growth) and SUCROS II, in which crop growth is limited only by water shortage.\n\nThe ORYZA2000 rice growth model has been developed at the IRRI in cooperation with Wageningen University. This model, too, is programmed in FORTRAN. The scope of this model is limited to rice, which is the main food crop for Asia.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture has sponsored a number of applicable crop growth models for various major US crops, such as cotton, soy bean, wheat and rice.\nOther widely used models are the precursor of SUCROS (SWATR), CERES, several incarnations of PLANTGRO, SUBSTOR, the FAO-sponsored CROPWAT, AGWATER, the erosion-specific model EPIC, and the cropping system CropSyst.\n\nA less mechanistic growth and competition model, called the conductance model, has been developed, mainly at Warwick-HRI, Wellesbourne, UK. This model simulates light interception and growth of individual plants based on the lateral expansion of their crown zone areas. Competition between plants is simulated by a set algorithms related to competition for space and resultant light intercept as the canopy closes. Some versions of the model assume overtopping of some species by others. Although the model cannot take account of water or mineral nutrients, it can simulate individual plant growth, variability in growth within plant communities and inter-species competition. This model was written in Matlab. See Benjamin and Park (2007) Weed Research 47, 284–298 for a recent review.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298320", "title": "Neo-charismatic movement", "text": "Neo-charismatic movement\n\nThe Neo-charismatic (also third-wave charismatic or hypercharismatic) movement is a movement within evangelical Protestant Christianity that is composed of a diverse range of independent churches and organizations that emphasize the post-Biblical availability of gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and healing. The Neo-charismatic movement is considered to be the \"third wave\" of the Charismatic Christian tradition which began with Pentecostalism (the \"first wave\"), and was furthered by the Charismatic movement (the \"second wave\"). As a result of the growth of postdenominational and independent charismatic groups, Neo-charismatics are now believed to be more numerous than the first and second wave categories. As of 2002, some 19,000 denominations or groups, with approximately 295 million individual adherents, were identified as Neo-charismatic.\n\nThe \"first wave\" of Charismatic Christianity is Pentecostalism, which originated in 1901 in Kansas and later spread to Texas, Los Angeles, and then to other countries. Pentecostals formed their own churches and organizations, but by the 1960s their emphasis on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and signs and wonders began to influence mainline Protestant denominations and the \"second wave,\" or the charismatic movement, began. The Neo-charismatic movement, dubbed the \"third wave\", dates from the early 1980s and was a result of the growth of Pentecostal experiences among independent and indigenous Christian groups. Although the Neo-charismatic movement emerged in the 1980s, many churches in Africa were already exhibiting Neo-charismatic tendencies in the early twentieth century as some churches combined indigenous cosmologies with the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The greatest concentration of Neo-charismatic churches is found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In some regions, especially Africa and Latin America, Neo-charismatics are sometimes condemned by Pentecostals and Charismatics for their spiritual practices or for combining local cosmologies with Christian beliefs.\n\nPeter Wagner, who originally called this form of Christianity the \"Third Wave\" and is a theoretician of the Church Growth Movement, advocated for the principle of spiritual warfare against demons through his book \"Spiritual Power and Church Growth\". John Wimber, who founded the Association of Vineyard Churches in 1982, put forward the principle of \"miraculous healing\" as an element of the Christian life in his book \"Power Healing\". The current of \"power evangelism\" was developed through the work of John Wimber and publicized through his book \"Power Evangelism\". Together, Wagner and Wimber taught a course on Neo-charismatic spiritual gifts called \"Signs, Wonders, and Church Growth\" at Fuller Theological Seminary for four years starting in 1982. George Otis Junior is one of the originators of \"spiritual mapping,\" which is a practice among some third wave adherents that includes uncovering the histories of buildings and geographical locations to understand how those histories might be contributing to demonic possession in the present. In 2011, the movement (grouped with the charismatic movement), has 305 million people.\n\nIn terms of congregational governance, no single form, structure, or style of church service characterizes all Neo-charismatic services and churches. The Neo-charismatic categorization is broad and diverse and includes any group that is not considered Pentecostal or Charismatic but still emphasizes the power of the Holy spirit and supernatural signs and wonders. Pentecostals comprise Pentecostal denominations, charismatics bring Pentecostal tendencies to mainline denominations, but Neo-charismatics are indigenous, independent, post- and non-denominational Christian groups without formal denominational ties. The term \"non-denominational\" is used more often by churches than the \"Neo-charismatic\" term.\n\nMembers of the Neo-charismatic movement, like those in the Pentecostal movement and Charismatic movement, believe in and stress the post-Biblical availability of gifts of the Holy Spirit. These spiritual gifts, or \"charismata\", frequently include but are not limited to glossolalia (speaking in tongues), healing, and prophecy. Additionally, Neo-charismatic Christians practice the laying on of hands and seek the \"infilling\" of the Holy Spirit, although a specific experience of baptism with the Holy Spirit may not be requisite for experiencing such gifts. Neo-charismatic practices look very similar to Pentecostal and Charismatic practices, but the terminology used by Neo-charismatics to describe their practices is distinctly different from the typical terminology used by Pentecostals and Charismatics. Many Neo-charismatics believe that the \"end times\" are near, practice intercessory prayer that invokes the power of the Holy Spirit, and view their work as helping to transform the Church into the Kingdom of God on earth.\n\nSimilar to many Pentecostal and Charismatic groups, Neo-charismatics use electronic means of communication for broadcasting messages and worship services on social media, websites, radio stations, and television channels. Use of media resources enables Neo-charismatics to reach new audiences and grow their networks by reaching previously unreached people through technological means, and such communication has allowed for \"democratized access to the Holy Spirit\" because of the increasing forms of media that have been made available.\n\nDue to the diversity among churches and organizations that can be classified under the Neo-charismatic label, not all Neo-charismatics adhere to the following practices even if many of them do observe these sorts of rituals and beliefs.\n\nThe fight against spiritual demons occupies an important place in Neo-charismatic teachings and prayers. The exorcising of demons is sometimes also referred to as deliverance ministries because a person or object is \"delivered\" or saved from an evil spiritual force. Spiritual mapping, a subset of practices under the broad umbrella of spiritual warfare, is the process by which defiled land, houses, and churches are discovered through careful observation of the history of the region and are subsequently illustrated on a map. A relatively well-known example of this type of spiritual mapping occurred in Amarillo, Texas by the group Repent Amarillo. If traumatic or evil histories are uncovered, mass exorcisms are sometimes organized to drive out territorial demons or historical demons in an ancestral line. \"Prayerwalking\" is also an encouraged form of spiritual warfare among some Neo-charismatics and is connected to spiritual mapping. In prayerwalking, believers pray against evil spirits while walking through areas that are known as places where historical evil took place or are places where evil takes place currently.\n\nThe ability to bring about \"signs and wonders\" by Christians who have confessed their belief in the Holy Spirit and have been anointed to do miracles is an important aspect of Neo-charismatic evangelism. Healing and financial prosperity are examples of \"power encounters,\" or supernatural acts, that occur in this type of evangelism. Neo-charismatics believe power evangelism, in which supernatural wonders accompany the sharing of the Gospel message, is more effective than evangelism without signs and is more similar to the type of evangelism that first century Christians used.\n\nSome Neo-charismatics are interested in the reconfiguration of church leadership to reflect a structure they believe is upheld in Ephesians 4:11-13, \"The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.\" In this passage, there are five \"offices,\" including apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor and teacher. Pastors, teachers, and evangelists are commonly found in evangelical churches, but some Neo-charismatic groups and movements, like Five Fold Ministry and the New Apostolic Reformation, seek to restructure their church organization to actively include apostles and prophets.\n\nThe following are examples of notable Neo-charismatic movements, associations, and congregations, along with their countries of origin:\n"}
{"id": "2298321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298321", "title": "Leaf area index", "text": "Leaf area index\n\nLeaf area index (LAI) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (\"LAI = leaf area / ground area, m / m\") in broadleaf canopies. In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used:\nThe definition “half the total leaf area” pertains to biological processes, such as gas exchange, whereas the definition “projected leaf area” was disregarded because the projection of a given area in one direction may differ in another direction when leaves are not flat, thick, or 3D-shaped. Moreover, “ground surface area” is specifically defined as “horizontal ground surface area” to clarify LAI on a sloping surface. The definition “half the total leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area” is suitable for all kinds of leaves and flat or sloping surfaces.\n\nLAI is a measure for the total area of leaves per unit ground area and directly related to the amount of light that can be intercepted by plants. It is an important variable used to predict photosynthetic primary production, evapotranspiration and as a reference tool for crop growth. As such, LAI plays an essential role in theoretical production ecology. An inverse exponential relation between LAI and light interception, which is linearly proportional to the primary production rate, has been established:\n\nwhere \"P\" designates the maximum primary production and formula_2 designates a crop-specific growth coefficient. This inverse exponential function is called the primary production function.\n\nLAI ranges from 0 (bare ground) to over 10 (dense conifer forests).\n\nLAI can be determined directly by taking a statistically significant sample of foliage from a plant canopy, measuring the leaf area per sample plot and dividing it by the plot land surface area. Indirect methods measure canopy geometry or light extinction and relate it to LAI.\n\nDirect methods can be easily applied on deciduous species by collecting leaves during leaf fall in traps of certain area distributed below the canopy. The area of the collected leaves can be measured using a leaf area meter or an image scanner and image analysis software (ImageJ) and mobile applications (Leafscan, Petiole, Easy Leaf Area). The measured leaf area can then be divided by the area of the traps to obtain LAI. Alternatively, leaf area can be measured on a sub-sample of the collected leaves and linked to the leaf dry mass (e.g. via Specific Leaf Area, SLA cm/g). That way it is not necessary to measure the area of all leaves one by one, but weigh the collected leaves after drying (at 60–80 °C for 48 h). Leaf dry mass multiplied by the specific leaf area is converted into leaf area.\nDirect methods in evergreen species are necessarily destructive. However, they are widely used in crops and pastures by harvesting the vegetation and measuring leaf area within a certain ground surface area. It is very difficult (and also unethical) to apply such destructive techniques in natural ecosystems, particularly in forests of evergreen tree species. Foresters have developed techniques that determine leaf area in evergreen forests through allometric relationships.\nDue to the difficulties and the limitations of the direct methods for estimating LAI, they are mostly used as reference for indirect methods that are easier and faster to apply.\n\nIndirect methods of estimating LAI \"in situ\" can be divided in two categories:\n\n\nDue to the subjectivity and labor involved with the first method, indirect non-contact measurements are typically preferred. Non-contact LAI tools, such as hemispherical photography, Hemiview Plant Canopy Analyser from Delta-T Devices, the CI-110 Plant Canopy Analyzer from CID Bio-Science, LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer from LI-COR Biosciences and the LP-80 LAI ceptometer from Decagon Devices, measure LAI in a non-destructive way. Hemispherical photography methods estimate LAI and other canopy structure attributes from analyzing upward-looking fisheye photographs taken beneath the plant canopy. The LAI-2200 calculates LAI and other canopy structure attributes from solar radiation measurements made with a wide-angle optical sensor. Measurements made above and below the canopy are used to determine canopy light interception at five angles, from which LAI is computed using a model of radiative transfer in vegetative canopies. The LP-80 calculates LAI by means of measuring the difference between light levels above the canopy and at ground level, and factoring in the leaf angle distribution, solar zenith angle, and plant extinction coefficient. Such indirect methods, where LAI is calculated based upon observations of other variables (canopy geometry, light interception, leaf length and width, etc.) are generally faster, amenable to automation, and thereby allow for a larger number of spatial samples to be obtained. For reasons of convenience when compared to the direct (destructive) methods, these tools are becoming more and more important.\n\nThe disadvantage of the direct method is that it is destructive, time consuming and expensive, especially if the study area is very large.\n\nThe disadvantage of the indirect method is that in some cases it can underestimate the value of LAI in very dense canopies, as it does not account for leaves that lie on each other, and essentially act as one leaf according to the theoretical LAI models. Ignorance of non-randomness within canopies may cause underestimation of LAI up to 25%, introducing path length distribution in the indirect method can improve the measuring accuracy of LAI.\n\n\n"}

It continues north through the settled areas of South Australia and is a total of long, from North Adelaide to out of Port Augusta. It follows the route established in the early years of the colony by explorer John Horrocks and was a major route for farmers and graziers to reach the capital, passing through rich farmland and the Clare Valley wine region. In 2011, the section of road between Gawler to Wilmington was renamed Horrocks Highway.\n\nMain North Road from Gawler to Wilmington was renamed to Horrocks Highway in 2011 to honour John Horrocks, an early explorer and pioneer in the region. However while Main North Road turns west in Wilmington through Horrocks Pass to join the Augusta Highway as route B56, route B82 carries the name Horrocks Highway north to Quorn.\n\nMain North Road branches from the northern end of O'Connell Street (North Adelaide) and passes through the Adelaide Parklands and the suburbs of Thorngate, Medindie, Medindie Gardens, Nailsworth, Prospect, Sefton Park, Blair Athol and Enfield before reaching the major intersection at Gepps Cross. Here the road forks, with the Port Wakefield Road (A1 - National Highway 1) continuing to the north, and the Main North Road turning northeast and continuing as route A20.\n\nIt continues through the outer northern suburbs, passing Mawson Lakes and Salisbury, crossing the Little Para River and passing Elizabeth and Smithfield before entering Gawler. In Gawler, it crosses the South Para and North Para Rivers, and the Barossa Valley Way branches to the east between them. Just north of Gawler, it passes under the Sturt Highway which heads east to the Barossa Valley, Riverland, northern Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nThis is where the name Horrocks Highway takes over from the historic name of Main North Road. The environment changes from the urban environment to undulating land, mostly cleared for grain cropping. Several of the towns have grain storage bunkers or silos. It crosses the Light River then crosses and follows the Gilbert River to where the Barrier Highway branches northeast towards Riverton and Burra.\n\nOver the next ridge, it crosses the Wakefield River and enters the southern end of the Clare Valley. The dominant scenery changes from grain crops to grapevines from Auburn to Clare, then returns to grain fields again north of the Hutt River as it passes through the Southern Flinders Ranges. It crosses the Broughton River near Yacka and on to Wilmington at the eastern side of Horrocks Pass. As the Horrocks Highway is in the valley between the southern Flinders Ranges and northern Mount Lofty Ranges, it is in the relatively wetter climate south of Goyder's Line.\n\nAt Wilmington, Main North Road diverges from the Horrocks Highway. Main North Road turns northwest from Wilmington to pass through Horrocks Pass to Winninowie where it meets the Augusta Highway south of Port Augusta. The Horrocks Highway continues northwards from Wilmington to Quorn.\n\nIn the metropolitan area, the road is a major commuter route to the central business district in the Adelaide city centre.\n\nThe portion of Main North Road between the city centre and Mawson Lakes is a 15-minute public transport 'Go Zone', with the maximum wait for a bus being 15 minutes during peak times (7:30 am – 6:30 pm weekdays) and 30 minutes on weekends and evenings. Bus routes via Main North Road generally begin with the prefix \"22x\". The bus service is provided by SouthLink for Adelaide Metro.\n\nFrom North Adelaide, the route numbers used along the road are:\n\nIn late 2010 when the Northern Expressway was completed, National Highway A20 was diverted to the new road as National Highway M20. Main North Road and the southern section of the Gawler Bypass Road were then designated as State Route A52. In late 2016, the Northern Expressway was designated M2, and route 20 returned to Main North Road as state route A20 to Gepps Cross.\n\n"}

In 2013 headquarters were moved to the Barbican in London leaving a small call centre in Milton Keynes.\n\nIn South Africa the company bought the assets of the 'Health and Racquet Club' chain after the latter's parent company, Leisurenet, had been placed in liquidation in October 2000 for 319.6 million South African Rand (approximately £24.5m as at November 2011). The South African company also runs Virgin Life Care.\n\nIn 2002, by which point the company had 350,000 members, Branson sold 55 percent of the company to Bridgepoint Capital for £40 million. In 2005, Branson bought out Bridgepoint's stake in the business for £134.5 million.\n\nIt subsequently expanded its operations in 2004 to Italy. By 2005 the company had 25 clubs in the UK, 77 clubs in South Africa and 12 clubs in Continental Europe. It opened its first Australian club in Sydney in late 2008, with further clubs launch in Singapore and Thailand in 2014.\n\nOn 1 November 2006 it took over the UK-based operation of the more prestigious Holmes Place chain, thus increasing its UK chain of clubs from 24 to 72 overnight. On 26 April 2011 it announced the takeover of UK gym operator Esporta's 55 clubs increasing the UK business to 124 clubs.\n\nIn 2013, Virgin Active expanded into the South East Asian market, first opening a club in Singapore at the heart of the CBD. Located on Level 6, Tower 2, One Raffles Place. Playing a significant role in opening the first club in South East Asia was Christian Mason, the newly appointed 'Managing Director South East Asia'. Christian Mason then went on to opening 13 more clubs in both Singapore and Thailand.\n\nThe current Group CEO is founder Matthew Bucknall. In 2014 Virgin Active launched a new low-cost gym called Virgin Active RED. The RED gyms focuses on first timers who may be intimidated by training by strategically placing exercise equipment in different stages around the gym and further having touch screen computers and other technologies placed in these predefined area's teaching the user how to do the exercise correctly. \n\nOn 16 April 2015, it was reported that Virgin Group and their private equity backers had sold 80% of Virgin Active to the South African investment firm Brait, owned by the billionaire Christo Wiese. The sale price was £682 million for an 80% stake, valuing the business at £1.3 billion, including debt, and the transaction was completed in July 2015. The company will continue to operate under the Virgin Active brand.\n\nIn 2016 they began the sale of 35 clubs to Nuffield health\n\nIn 2017 they completed a sale of 15 clubs to David Lloyd\n\nIn December 2015, the South African Competition Tribunal announced that it is investigating Virgin Active's South African operations and the Discovery Group for contravening the Competition Act. The investigation continues.\n\nIn March 2003, 32 year old City banker Katarzyna Woja stepped out of the lift at the Virgin Active (then Holmes Place) Broadgate Health Club in central London, when its cable snapped and the hydraulic cabin plunged downwards.\nWoja became trapped between the cabin's mantel and the lift shaft and was dragged downwards, suffering horrific injuries. She died soon after. Although she was with seven other people in the lift, she was the only one injured in the accident, as she was the last one to step out of the lift. Following a lengthy investigation by health and safety experts Holmes Place (bought by Virgin Active) was charged with six breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act while the lift manufacturer ThyssenKrupp was charged with four breaches.\n\nIn December 2011 Virgin's flagship club in High Street Kensington was accused of covering up the death of model and city worker Elsa Carneau, who drowned in the swimming pool at the west London club. A fire crew and paramedics tried to revive the Imperial College graduate for almost an hour before she was taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Westminster coroner’s court heard that staff at the club administered CPR incorrectly and falsified paperwork relating to CCTV checks to pretend that they had been monitoring the pool in a “distasteful” attempt to cover their tracks. Firemen also described how a man, who said he was a member of staff, had stood by filming efforts to resuscitate Carneau on his mobile telephone. Pierre Carneau, the victim's father criticised Virgin active for not apologising for the accident. He stated \"It was an accident waiting to happen. If things had been done properly, I think there’s a chance our daughter may still be alive.” Virgin Active admitted health and safety breaches and was fined £100,000 at Southwark Crown Court in December 2013. An investigation found “serious shortcomings in the management of risks connected with swimming activity at the club” going back to 2009.\n\nIn April 2014, three gym goers were injured when a suspended ceiling collapsed on to a line of rowing machines at the Virgin Active on Chiswick High Road, in West London.\n"}

An independent film, it won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival and launched the careers of Solondz and Heather Matarazzo. The story follows the unpopular middle schooler Dawn as she goes to extreme lengths trying to earn the respect of her vicious fellow students and her disinterested family. Dawn reappears in two of Solondz's other films, \"Palindromes\" and \"Wiener-Dog\".\n\nEleven-and-a-half-year-old Dawn Wiener is a shy, unattractive, unpopular seventh grader living in a middle-class suburban community in New Jersey. Her seventeen-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, eight-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate sixth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard.\n\nAt school, Dawn is ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her. Dawn gets in trouble at school after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. Brandon doesn't go through with his threat to rape Dawn after school, but he orders her to meet him again. After she complies, he takes her to an abandoned field. There, he instead starts an earnest conversation with her, then kisses her.\n\nMark's band is joined by Steve Rodgers, a charismatic and handsome aspiring teenage rock musician who agrees to play in the band in exchange for Mark's help in school. Dawn decides to pursue him romantically after he spends time with her, even though one of Steve's former girlfriends tells Dawn she has no chance of being with him.\n\nDawn and Brandon form an innocent romance, but Brandon is arrested and expelled for suspected drug dealing. Dawn visits his home and meets his father and mentally challenged brother who requires constant supervision. After kissing Dawn, Brandon runs away to avoid being sent to military school.\n\nAfter angrily rejecting Ralphy, Dawn is left with no friends. When she refuses to tear down her clubhouse to make room for her parents' 20th wedding anniversary party, her mother has Mark and Missy destroy it and gives them her share of a cake. At the party, Dawn intends to proposition Steve, but gets cold feet upon seeing him involved with another girl, and is contemptuously rebuffed. Steve plays with Missy, who pushes Dawn into a kiddie pool. That evening, the family watches a videotape of the party, laughing when Dawn falls into the water. That night, Dawn smashes the tape and briefly brandishes her hammer over Missy as she sleeps.\n\nA few weeks later, Dawn's father's car breaks down and her mother has to pick him up from work. Dawn is supposed to tell Missy to find a ride home from ballet class but chooses not to do so after arguing with her. Missy is kidnapped while walking home. When Missy's tutu is found in Times Square, Dawn goes to New York City to find her. After a full day searching for Missy, Dawn phones home and Mark tells her that Missy was found by police after being abducted by a pedophile neighbor who lives on their street. Dawn returns home. Later, Dawn's classmates ridicule her as she presents a thank you speech. After the principal tells the unruly students to be quiet, Dawn musters the emotional strength to finish her speech and makes a quick exit.\n\nSummer arrives and Dawn is relieved that school is over for the time-being. Mark tells Dawn that she cannot expect school life to get any better until she starts high school. As Dawn's parents continue mistreating and ignoring her, Dawn signs herself up to attend a summer camp in Florida. On a school trip to Walt Disney World, Dawn sits among other girls from her school and joins them in singing the school anthem. Unnoticed, her voice slowly trails off as she sits looking out a bus window.\n\nThe film was a surprise success, considering it was a relatively low budget, independently produced film. It garnered critical praise for its nail-biting view of a pre-teen outcast, and won the Grand Jury Prize for best dramatic feature at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival. Critic Roger Ebert was vocal about his love for the film, giving it four stars out of four and placing it at No. 5 on his \"Best of 1996\" list.\n\nThe film currently holds a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An outstanding sophomore feature, \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" sees writer-director Todd Solondz mining suburban teen angst for black, biting comedy.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\n"}

It is the language of Kobaïa, a fictional planet invented by Vander and the setting for a musical \"space opera\" sung in Kobaïan by Magma on ten concept albums.\n\nFrench drummer and composer Christian Vander formed progressive rock band Magma in late 1969 in an attempt to fill the void left by the death of American jazz musician and composer John Coltrane. Magma's first album, \"Magma\" (later reissued as \"Kobaïa\"), told a story of refugees fleeing a future Earth and settling on a fictional planet called Kobaïa. The lyrics were all in Kobaïan (except the title track, sung mostly in English), a language Vander constructed for the album, some sung by soloists and others by \"massive quasi-operatic choruses\". Over the next three decades Magma made a further nine albums that continued the mythology of Kobaïa, all sung in Kobaïan.\n\nVander (his Kobaïan name is Zëbëhn Straïn dë Ğeuštaah) said in an interview that he invented Kobaïan for Magma because \"French just wasn't expressive enough. Either for the story or for the sound of the music\". He said that the language developed in parallel with the music, that sounds appeared as he was composing on a piano. Vander based Kobaïan in part on elements of Slavic and Germanic languages and in part on the scat-yodeling vocal style of American avant garde jazz singer Leon Thomas. The subsequent expansion of the language became a group effort, and as Magma's personnel changed, so new ideas were incorporated into the language (and the music).\n\nBritish music critic Ian MacDonald said that Kobaïan is \"phonetic, not semantic\", and that it is based on \"sonorities, not on applied meanings\". One of Magma's singers, Klaus Blasquiz, described Kobaïan as \"a language of the heart\" whose words are \"inseparable from the music\". Magma expert Michael Draine said \"the abstraction provided by the Kobaïan verse seems to inspire Magma's singers to heights of emotional abandon rarely permitted by conventional lyrics\".\n\nThe Kobaïan lyrics on Magma's albums were generally not translated (though both Kobaïan lyrics and an English translation were provided for the first UK release on A&M of \"Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh\"), but clues to the unfolding story of Kobaïa were given in French in the albums' liner notes. While the original intent of the language was to avoid over-scrutiny, unofficial Kobaïan online lexicons were created by Magma fans, and Vander himself has since translated many of the words.\n\nChristian Vander called Magma's music \"Zeuhl\" (Kobaïan for \"celestial\"), and it influenced a number of other (mostly French) bands, including Zao (France), Art Zoyd (France) and Univers Zero (Belgium). Zeuhl later became a music genre which was used to describe music similar to that of Magma. Several Japanese Zeuhl bands also sprang up, including Ruins and Kōenji Hyakkei, whose lyrics are also sung in a constructed language similar to Kobaïan.\n\n\n"}

The album is the first to feature drummer Steve Riley. \"Rip and Tear\", \"Never Enough\", \"The Ballad of Jayne\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" and \"Malaria\" were released as the album's singles.\n\nFollowing the success of their self-titled debut album the previous year, L.A. Guns quickly set about recording the follow-up in 1989. Writing for all tracks were credited to all five members of the band, while \"Never Enough\" was co-written by Gregg Tripp and Phil Roy. Four tracks were re-recorded by the reunited classic lineup of the band in 1999 for the compilation \"Greatest Hits and Black Beauties\", and the whole album was re-recorded for the release \"Cocked & Re-Loaded\".\n\nUpon its release, \"Cocked & Loaded\" peaked at number 38 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1990. Both \"Rip and Tear\" and \"The Ballad of Jayne\" reached the top 50 of the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart, while the latter registered at number 33 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Media response to the album was positive, with critics praising the band's development of their sound from their debut album the previous year.\n\nL.A. Guns recorded the follow-up to their 1988 self-titled debut album early the following year, working with producers Duane Baron, John Purdell and Tom Werman. Sessions took place at three Hollywood studios, One on One Studios, Music Grinder and Conway Recording. The album was the band's first to feature drummer Steve Riley, who took over from his predecessor Nickey \"Beat\" Alexander after the recording for \"L.A. Guns\" was completed. Five singles were released in promotion of the album, two of which charted in the US – \"The Ballad of Jayne\" reached number 33 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 25 on the Mainstream Rock chart, while \"Rip and Tear\" reached number 47 on the latter chart.

Outside of the US, the album reached number 23 on the Japanese Albums Chart, and number 38 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nMedia response to \"Cocked & Loaded\" was generally positive. \"Cash Box\" magazine claimed that the band had \"grown by leaps and bounds\" since the release of their self-titled debut the previous year, praising the performance of lead guitarist Tracii Guns in particular. \"Billboard\" magazine's review was more mixed, as they described the album as \"a spotty affair\" and added that the band \"has a sound that verges on the metal generic at times, but when the members click ... they can run with the best of the pack\". The opinion of \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Janiss Garza was similar, who claimed that \"The L.A.-based quintet's blatant disregard for subtlety works, as long as you don't think too deeply\" and praised \"Magdalaine\" and \"Give a Little\" in particular as \"a few interesting turns\".\n\nRetrospectively, the album has received widespread critical acclaim. Steve Huey of music website AllMusic dubbed it \"L.A. Guns' most consistent and effective album\", claiming that it \"manages to balance the underlying darkness of Guns N' Roses' urban outlook with Mötley Crüe's party-anthem glam metal\". In particular, Huey praised the songwriting as \"among [the band's] best\", highlighting the tracks \"Never Enough\" and \"The Ballad of Jayne\". \"Rolling Stone\" magazine named \"Cocked & Loaded\" the 27th best \"hair metal\" album of all-time, praising the variety of material on the release including \"bullet-belt bravado\" on \"Rip and Tear\", \"17 Crash\" and \"Give a Little\", the \"hard-living knowledge\" on display on \"Sleazy Come Easy Go\", and the \"proggier side\" shown on \"Magdalaine\" and \"Malaria\".\n"}

Shankar, marking his debut, and produced by K. T. Kunjumon. It stars Arjun and Madhoo in the lead roles while Goundamani, Senthil, Charan Raj, Subhashri, and Vineeth play supporting roles. The film's music (score and soundtrack) was composed by A. R. Rahman. The choreography in the film was viewed as a highlight.\n\nThe film narrates the story of a Brahmin Krishnamoorthy \"Kicha\", a modern day Robin Hood who runs a pappadam business in Chennai along with his sidekick Mani. Azhagar Nambi, a tough police officer takes it upon himself to nab the outlaw and break his mask in front of the society only to fail miserably. Unable to digest this fact he continues his pursuit while Kicha surges ahead with his escapedes for serving the needy. Whether Nambi will succeed in catching Kicha and the events which led Kicha to be altruistic forms the rest of the story.\n\nThe film was released on 30 July 1993. This high-budget production won positive reviews and became a blockbuster at the box office. The film was remade in Hindi as \"The Gentleman\" in 1994, by Mahesh Bhatt, starring Chiranjeevi.\n\nIn Ooty, Krishnamoorthy alias Kicha (Arjun) and Mani (Goundamani) perform a swashbuckling heist of money of several crores while being in disguise diverting the attention of police, and escape in Nilgiri Mountain Railway, much to the frustration of a chasing police officer named Ratnam (Ajay Rathnam).\n\nKicha is a respected citizen who runs a home-based pappadam business along with Mani in Chennai. Susheela (Madhoo), one of Kicha's many female employees, has a crush on him and is constantly demanding his attention. Another thing adding to her woes is the arrival of her jovial cousin Sugandhi (Subhashri). She makes the place so lively and playful with silly fights between Mani and Babloo (Senthil). Sugandhi later develops a crush on Kicha, especially after being saved by him from some molesting goons. Kicha tells to her that he has no such feelings for her and wants her to find a suitable mate. Before leaving Chennai, Sugandhi steals Kicha's ring as a souvenir.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts at nabbing the thief, a disgraced Azhagar Nambi (Charan Raj) shaves his head and is left with a ring mark on his face, after a scuffle with the thief. On investigating, he later realizes that the mark was formed by a ceremonial ring worn by Brahmin priests, but to his vain, finds that the specific design of this ring is uncommon to Brahmin priests, but rather resembles a mangalsutra. Nambi is forced by his parents into getting married and by coincidence to Sugandhi, from whom he gets the particular ring that he was tracking and finds out that it belongs to Kicha. In an attempt to trap and arrest Kicha, Nambi plots an attempt at Kicha's house where they were invited for a wedding dinner, hosted by Kicha, where he shoots Kicha, but the latter narrowly escapes with a bullet injury in his hand, along with Mani. Susheela follows them to their hideout, where Susheela finds the duo and accuses Kicha for his deed.\n\nAfter Susheela threatens to commit suicide, Kicha reveals his flashback about his student life as a district level topper along with his best friend Ramesh (Vineeth), and when they both were denied their desired medical college seats due to bribery, that leads to the tragic suicides of Kicha's mother Ponnamal (Manorama) and Ramesh. Since then, Kicha became a thief to build a college of his own, where he desires to make education available to the deserved without any difference to poor, rich, or any caste.\n\nIn order to fund the final stages of the college building, aware of the police trap, Kicha makes one last attempt to steal money from the Chief Minister (Rajan P. Dev), resulting in success, but Nambi gains the upper hand in arresting him. In the courtroom, Kicha demands that the State CM should come to the courtroom, who was previously educational minister demanded the bribe from him. Though the CM is exposed to the public, he is still let off, which infuriates a youth who was inspired by Kicha's ideologies. The youth kills the minister by planting a bomb on himself.\n\nDuring the end credits, it is shown that Kicha serves his jail sentence and subsequently inaugurates the medical college for the poor students after his release.\n\n\nSpecial appearances in \"Chikku Bukku Rayile\" song\n\nAfter scoring back-to-back successes like \"Vasanthakala Paravai\" (1991) and \"Suriyan\" (1992), producer K. T. Kunjumon wanted to collaborate again with director Pavithran and actor R. Sarathkumar; however since they went on to do other projects, the collaboration did not happen. Photographer Stills Ravi and editor V. T. Vijayan suggested the name of S. Shankar who worked as an assistant in these two films. Impressed with Shankar's story, he decided to produce the film, \"Gentleman\". Arjun Sarja was selected to portray the lead role after attempts to sign Sarathkumar failed. Even Arjun was initially reluctant. According to him, no filmmakers were ready to make a film with him until the release of \"Sevagan\" (1992) which was directed by Arjun himself. Therefore when Shankar approached him with the script of Gentleman, he decided to say a \"No\" after listening to the script just as he did to a few other directors. But he was impressed by the story and hence decided to do it. The climax scene where a student sacrifices his life by killing the film's antagonist was inspired from the assassination of Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa. Kunjumon insisted Shankar to rewrite the climax by adding this element, much to the dissatisfaction of Arjun, who felt that his heroism would get diluted. However, Kunjumon was adamant about the climax and it was shot as per his wish.\n\nThe score and soundtrack of the movie was composed by A. R. Rahman and lyrics by Vairamuthu and Vaali. \"Gentleman\" marked the beginning of a famed collaboration between A. R. Rahman and director S. Shankar. The film and soundtrack were dubbed and released in Telugu with the same name. The lyrics were penned by Rajashri for this version.\n\nThe choreography was done by Prabhu Deva, who also made an appearance in the song \"Chikku Bukku Rayile\", written by Vaali.\n\nThe soundtrack earned A. R. Rahman, his second Filmfare Best Music Director Award of the year 1993. He also won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Music Director for his work. Sujatha got the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback for her rendition of the track \"En Veettu Thotathil\".\n\nA \"Gentleman\" instrumental adaptation album was subsequently released on Lahari and became a runaway success. The track \"Ottagathai Kattiko\" soundtracked a BBC fashion show. The song is based on Carnatic rāgam Dharmavati. The song \"Paakathe\" is based on Mohanam raga.\n\n\n\nKunjumon had to distribute the film on his own since no distributors were willing to buy this film as they felt \"it looked like a dubbed film\". The film was released on 30 July 1993 and became a blockbuster at the box office.\n\n\"New Straits Times\" in its review dated 14 August 1993 stated: \"Sankar .. has provided thought-provoking story [..] build up the story well, making us eager to find out why the hero is committing all those robberies.\" Writing for \"The Indian Express\", Malini Mannath said, \"Shankar makes a promising debut infusing his script with action, sentiment, comedy and even some titillating scenes for added measure and tries to give something different within the parameters of commercial cinema. Jeeva's camera is effective in capturing the well choreographed stunt scenes (Vikram Dharma).\"\n\nIn the 2019 Tamil film \"Hero\", Arjun reprises his role as Sathyamoorthy (whose name is similar to Krishnamoorthy), a man who takes away money from the rich to build a school that is free for everyone.\n\n"}

She then became Oxford University's first graduate in Chinese language in 1940. It was at Oxford that she met Yang.\n\nAfter their marriage, the couple were based in Beijing as prominent translators of Chinese literature into English in the latter half of the 20th century, working for the Foreign Languages Press. Their four-volume \"Selected Works of Lu Xun\" (1956–1957) made the major work of China's greatest 20th-century writer available in English for the first time. Their work on \"The Dream of Red Mansions\", an 18th-century novel still read by almost all educated Chinese, was interrupted by their imprisonment, but their faithful, readable three-volume translation appeared in 1978.\n\nThe couple were imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution.

{"id": "2298439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298439", "title": "Black Hoof", "text": "Black Hoof\n\nCatecahassa or Black Hoof (c. 1740–1831) was the head civil chief of the Shawnee Indians in the Ohio Country of what became the United States. A member of the Mekoche division of the Shawnees, Black Hoof became known as a fierce warrior during the early wars between the Shawnee and Anglo-American colonists. Black Hoof claimed to have been present at the Battle of the Monongahela in 1755, when General Edward Braddock was defeated during the French and Indian War, although there is no contemporary evidence that Shawnees took part in that battle.\n\nLittle documentary evidence of Black Hoof's life appears in the historical record before 1795. As a child he may have been a member of a wandering band of some 400 Shawnees led by Peter Chartier between 1745 and 1748, who founded the community in Kentucky called Eskippakithiki and later moved to Sylacauga, Alabama, eventually settling in Old Shawneetown, Illinois. He probably took part in the Battle of Point Pleasant during Lord Dunmore's War against the Virginia militia in 1774. During the American Revolutionary War, he may have taken part in the siege of Boonesborough in 1778, which was led by Chief Blackfish, as well as the subsequent defense of the Shawnee village of Chillicothe in 1779. In the Northwest Indian War, Black Hoof was defeated by \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne and, following the collapse of the Indian confederation, surrendered in 1795.\n\nLike Little Turtle of the Miamis, Black Hoof decided that American Indians needed to adapt culturally to the ways of the whites in order to prevent decimation through warfare. During his later years, Black Hoof became an ally of the United States and was responsible for keeping the majority of the Shawnee nation from joining \"Tecumseh's War\", which became part of the War of 1812.\n\nBlack Hoof resisted the policy of Indian removal that the United States implemented soon after the War of 1812. He never signed a removal treaty, and continued to lead his tribe until his death in Saint Johns, Ohio in 1831. After his death, the Shawnee were eventually compelled to emigrate to the West.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298445", "title": "Diving disorders", "text": "Diving disorders\n\nDiving disorders, or diving related medical conditions, are conditions associated with underwater diving, and include both conditions unique to underwater diving, and those that also occur during other activities. This second group further divides into conditions caused by exposure to ambient pressures significantly different from surface atmospheric pressure, and a range of conditions caused by general environment and equipment associated with diving activities.\n\nDisorders particularly associated with diving include those caused by variations in ambient pressure, such as barotraumas of descent and ascent, decompression sickness and those caused by exposure to elevated ambient pressure, such as some types of gas toxicity. There are also non-dysbaric disorders associated with diving, which include the effects of the aquatic environment, such as drowning, which also are common to other water users, and disorders caused by the equipment or associated factors, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide poisoning. General environmental conditions can lead to another group of disorders, which include hypothermia and motion sickness, injuries by marine and aquatic organisms, contaminated waters, man-made hazards, and ergonomic problems with equipment. Finally there are pre-existing medical and psychological conditions which increase the risk of being affected by a diving disorder, which may be aggravated by adverse side effects of medications and other drug use.\n\nTreatment depends on the specific disorder, but often includes oxygen therapy, which is standard first aid for most diving accidents, and is hardly ever contra-indicated for a person medically fit to dive, and hyperbaric therapy is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness. Screening for medical fitness to dive can reduce some of the risk for some of the disorders.\n\nMany diving accidents or illnesses are related to the effect of pressure on gases in the body;\n\nBarotrauma is physical injury to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside or in contact with the body, and the surroundings.\n\nBarotrauma occurs when the difference in pressure between the surroundings and the gas space makes the gas expand in volume, distorting adjacent tissues enough to rupture cells or damage tissue by deformation. A special case, where pressure in tissue is reduced to the level that causes dissolved gas to come out of solution as bubbles, is called \"decompression sickness\", \"the bends\", or \"caisson disease\".\n\nSeveral organs are susceptible to barotrauma, however the cause is well understood and procedures for avoidance are clear. Nevertheless, barotrauma occurs and can be life-threatening, and procedures for first aid and further treatment are an important part of diving medicine.\n\nHazards in the underwater environment that can affect divers include marine life, marine infections, polluted water, ocean currents, waves and surges and man-made hazards such as boats, fishing lines and underwater construction. Diving medical personnel need to be able to recognize and treat accidents from large and small predators and poisonous creatures, appropriately diagnose and treat marine infections and illnesses from pollution as well as diverse maladies such as sea sickness, traveler's diarrhea and malaria.\n\nIn most places, contamination comes from a variety of sources (non-point source pollution). In a few it is primarily pollution from a single industrial source. The more immediate threat is from locations where high concentrations of toxic or pathogenic pollutants are present, but lower concentrations of less immediately harmful contaminants can have a longer term influence on the diver's health. Three major categories of contamination can cause health and safety problems for divers. These are biological, chemical and radioactive materials.\n\nThe risks from hazardous materials are generally proportional to dosage - exposure time and concentration, and the effects of the material on the body. This is particularly the case with chemical and radiological contaminants.There may be a threshold limit value which will not usually produce ill effects over long term exposure. Others may have a cumulative effect.\n\nThe United Nations identification numbers for hazardous materials classifies hazardous materials under 9 categories:\nA contaminant may be classed under one or more of these categories.\n\nPoisonous substances are also classified in 9 categories:\n\nA variety of disorders may be caused by ergonomic problems due to poorly fitting equipment.\n\n\nTreatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders, but two treatments are commonly associated with first aid and definitive treatment where diving is involved. These are first aid oxygen administration at high concentration, which is seldom contraindicated, and generally recommended as a default option in diving accidents where there is any significant probability of hypoxia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), which is the definitive treatment for most incidences of decompression illness. Hyperbaric treatment on other breathing gases is also used for treatment of decompression sickness if HBO is inadequate.\n\nThe administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine, both for first aid and for longer-term treatment.\n\nRecompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness. Now, it is a highly specialized treatment modality that has been found to be effective in the treatment of many conditions where the administration of oxygen under pressure has been found to be beneficial. Studies have shown it to be quite effective in some 13 indications approved by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.\n\nHyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective, as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness, However, in some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to eliminate the bubbles in the tissues that cause the symptoms.\n\nAll divers should be free of conditions and illnesses that would negatively impact their safety and well-being underwater. The diving medical physician should be able to identify, treat and advise divers about illnesses and conditions that would cause them to be at increased risk for a diving accident.\n\nSome reasons why a person should not be allowed to dive are as follows:\n\n\nConditions that may increase risk of diving disorders:\n\nConditions considered temporary reasons to suspend diving activities:\n"}
{"id": "2298460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298460", "title": "Leeton, New South Wales", "text": "Leeton, New South Wales\n\nLeeton is a town located in the Riverina region of southern New South Wales, Australia. Situated approximately 550 km west of Sydney and 450 km north of Melbourne in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, it is the administrative centre of the Leeton Shire Council local government area. Leeton's urban population in 2016 was 8,623. Situated in one of the most productive farming regions in the state, the town was designed by Walter Burley Griffin and purpose-built for the irrigation schemes announced by the New South Wales government in the early 1900s. Citrus, rice, cotton, grapes, walnuts and wheat farms can all be found throughout the Leeton Shire. Leeton is renowned as \"Australia's Rice Capital\" and as \"The Heart of SunRice Country\", as it is home to the SunRice headquarters. Other industry includes Freedom Foods, the Daily Drinks Co., JBS Australia, Webster Limited (walnuts and cotton) and Murrumbidgee Irrigation Limited.\n\nPrior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by the Wiradjuri people. The town is named after Charles Alfred Lee, a Minister for Public Works in New South Wales from 1904 to 1910.\nIn 1912 a water tower was built to supply water to the then tent town. Leeton Post Office opened on 6 September 1912.\n\nIn 1913 when the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales was formed Leeton was only a canvas town, the only houses being those built on farms by settlers and houses for its officers by the Commission. On 3 April 1913 the first block of land was sold in the town. During 1913 a kurrajong tree which became known as the Pioneers' Tree, was planted as a feature in Kurrajong Avenue, and a butter factory was established in the town.\n\nIn 1914 World War I broke out; of the town's population of 2000 people, 200 men were serving in the armed forces making it difficult to maintain the plantings in the irrigation area. During 1914 and 1915 an abattoir and canning factory were established in the town.\n\nIn August 1913 Walter Burley Griffin visited the town to complete its design.\nIn 1919 the Hydro Hotel was constructed for Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission executives to stay whilst in Leeton but was not licensed to sell alcohol until 1924 when the alcohol prohibition in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area was lifted.\n\nDuring 1920 the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales began to pressure the Government for relief for being responsible for providing civic and local government services with the Commission stating \"\"revenue which comes mainly from rents and water charges, having remained unchanged, is insufficient to cover the cost of local government services now that the weekly wage is more than double the figure paid when the settlement started\"\". The Commission chose and appointed an Advisory Board which was made up of pioneer farmers which already had been in operation in the Yanco area since 1913. In June 1925 the Commission released its annual report stating that a Royal Commission recommended setting up of local government bodies within the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area but no date had been decided.\n\nOn 1 January 1928 the Willimbong Shire was formed with the name \"Willimbong\" being retained until 19 July 1946 when it was renamed as Leeton Shire.\nIn 1929 the Roxy Theatre was built on a large vacant block of land on the corner of Wade and Pine Avenue and was completed and opened in April 1930.\n\nIn 1930 Willimbong Shire become the trustee of the Leeton Racecourse, established in 1912, when the land was gazetted as a reserve for racing, public recreation and aviation. In August 1931 Southern Cross became the first aircraft to officially landing at the aerodrome. During 1935 work was done at the aerodrome for it to be licensed to take aircraft including commercial aircraft. In August 1935 Western and Southern Provincial (W.A.S.P.) Airlines commenced an air service between Leeton and Sydney however the service was ended in 1936 when a Tugan Gannet aircraft used by W.A.S.P. Airlines crashed on 26 February 1936 in the Cordeaux Dam area.\n\nIn July 1938 it was proposed to the Willimbong Shire by the Civil Aviation Board that an area around Fivebough could be developed into an aerodrome since the Leeton Aerodrome at the race course was too small and could only operate on a restricted licence. Willimbong Shire agreed to lease the land with preliminary work carried out on the site however the aerodrome was never used by any commercial airline.\n\nDuring World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force established a training school in the nearby town of Narrandera which was a large aerodrome. After this a report from the Department of Civil Aviation stated that Fivebough was eminently suitable as an aerodrome but strongly recommended that they should consider jointly operating the aerodrome with Narrandera Shire.\n\nDuring the early part of the 1930s Willimbong Shire took over the town water supply when it also became apparent that the town needed a second water tower which was constructed next to the first tower with the construction completed on 27 March 1937.\nThe Swimming baths in Leeton was constructed by voluntary labour in 1931 and was completed on 24 February 1932. The Leeton Swimming Club made a request that the swimming baths be replaced by a modern swimming complex. In 1959 money was raised though the Irrigana Festival, which was a biennial festival in the town, with the Leeton Shire obtaining a loan with construction starting on the complex. On 17 November 1962 the Leeton & District Memorial Swimming Pool was opened.\n\nRice growing became a major industry during World War II under Government promotion to help supply food for troops. A number of local farmers, some such as teenager Norm Houghton, pioneered the planting of new varieties to suit the local conditions. The Irrigana Festival began in 1959 as a biennial festival but was short lived due to it lacking strong publicity value even though the festival was successful with fund raising. The name \"Irrigana\" was chosen from a competition in the Murrumbidgee Irrigator, In 1970 a biennial festival returned in the town known as the \"Rice Bowl Festival\". By 1988 the festival was renamed to \"Sunwhite Rice Festival\" with sponsorship from the Ricegrowers Co-Operative Limited.\n\nLeeton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nLeeton is the second largest educational centre in the Riverina after Wagga Wagga.\n\nLeeton Shire has three secondary schools:\nLeeton Shire has six primary schools:\nOther education includes:\n\nLeeton has a semi-arid climate (\"BSk\"), with hot dry summers and cool winters.\n\nLeeton is well connected to the surrounding regional centres and capital cities. Leeton is approximately 450 km from Melbourne along the Newell, Goulburn Valley and Hume Highways and 550 km from Sydney along the Sturt and Hume Highways. There are daily flights leaving Narrandera Airport, operated by Regional Express. The airport is located near the shire boundary, approximately 20 km from the CBD. There are coach services to Sydney and Adelaide, leaving Leeton Coach Terminal in Gidgee Street daily. NSW TrainLink also operates coach services to Wagga Wagga connecting with XPT services to Sydney and Melbourne. An Xplorer service to Griffith calls at Leeton railway station on Wednesday and Saturday, with the return service to Sydney calling on Thursday and Sunday.\n\nThe processing of agricultural products comprises Leeton's largest industry. Ricegrowers Limited, operating as SunRice and CopRice, is by far Leeton's largest employer. It's international headquarters are located in the town, as well a rice mill and manufacturing plants. Other major companies includes \"The Daily Juice Company\", \"JSB Australia\" (as a subsidiary of JBS S.A.), \"Murrumbidgee Irrigation Limited\", \"Pacific Fresh\",\"Toorak Wines\", \"Lillypilly Wines\" and \"Southern Central Engineering\", as well as \"Freedom Foods\", located in Stanbridge and \"Southern Cotton\", located in Whitton.\n\nThe extensive Vance Industrial Estate houses many smaller scale industrial companies.\n\nLeeton has a number of town landmarks, including the Roxy Theatre, War Memorial, Madonna Place, St Peter's Church, and the historic Hydro Motor Inn which are located in the centre of town. The Burley Griffin water towers located on Chelmsford Place are an iconic feature of the town.\n\nThe Ramsar-listed Fivebough and Tuckerbil Wetlands as well as the nearby Murrumbidgee River and Murrumbidgee Valley National Park provide ample opportunities for bush-walking and bird-watching.\n\nRestaurants and eateries available in Leeton include The Village Restaurant, Benvenuti Restaurant, Chan's Chinese Restaurant, Crate Cafe, The Coffee Tree, Mick's Bakehouse, Pages on Pine Restaurant and Grill, Leeton Soldiers Club, Henry's Chung Hing Chinese Restaurant, Hotel Leeton, L&D Bowling Club, Wade Hotel, Gaz's BBQ Parlor and La Fresco Cafe.\n\nLeeton is also home to two award-winning wineries, \"Lillipilly Estate Wines\" and \"Toorak Winery\". Both wineries use locally grown grapes to create their wine, and each feature a cellar-door where customers can sample and purchase their products. Together, they offer a selection of red and white wines, as well as Botrytis dessert wines and fortified wines.\n\nLeeton's main shopping areas include Pine Avenue and Kurrajong Avenue, as well as the town's two shopping complexes, Leeton Market Plaza (opened in 2006) and the Woolworths & Target Complex on Wamoon Avenue. Other retailers include: Best & Less, Aldi, The Reject Shop, IGA, EB Games, St. Vincent de Paul's and McDonald's.\n\nLeeton has its own newspaper known as The Irrigator (formerly known as \"The Murrumbidgee Irrigator\") which is released throughout the region on Tuesday and Friday. Leeton also has influences on the Star FM (99.7) and 2RG radio stations which are based in Griffith. WIN Television also broadcasts the local news of the Riverina on weeknights.\n\nNotable citizens originating from Leeton include former deputy leader of the NSW Labor Party and current federal MP for the NSW seat of Barton Linda Burney, Australian Labor Party Senator John Faulkner; Three time Olympic swimmer (Barcelona 1992, Atlanta 1996, SYDNEY 2000) and Seven times Commonwealth Games Gold Medallist Matthew Dunn; \nNational Rugby League footballer Rod Maybon; professional road bicycle racer Robert McLachlan; National Rugby League footballer and commentator Peter Peters; current National Rugby League players Jeff Robson, Clint Halden; former captain of the Australia national cricket team, cricketer and commentator Mark Taylor; consumer advocate Helen Wellings; AFL players Craig Nettelbeck, Max Kruse, Jacob Hopper and Jacob Townsend.\n\nAustralian poet and writer Henry Lawson lived in Leeton for two years, from 1916 to 1917.

His father was born a slave. As was not uncommon, his surname is a reversal of the slave owner's name, who was called \"Mok\".\n\nDe Kom finished primary and secondary school and obtained a diploma in bookkeeping. He worked for the \"Balata Compagnieën Suriname en Guyana\". On 29 July 1920 he resigned and left for Haiti where he worked for the \"Societé Commerciale Hollandaise Transatlantique\". In 1921, he left for the Netherlands. He volunteered for the \"Huzaren\" (a Dutch cavalry regiment) for a year. In 1922 he started working for a consultancy in The Hague. One year later he was laid off due to a reorganization. He then became a sales representative selling coffee, tea and tobacco for a company in The Hague, where he met his future wife, Nel. In addition to his work, he was active in numerous left-wing organizations, including nationalist Indonesian student organisations and (Aim Left).\n\nDe Kom and his family left for Suriname on 20 December 1932 and arrived on 4 January 1933. From that moment on he was closely watched by the colonial authorities. He started a consultancy in his parents' house. On 1 February he was arrested while en route to the governor's office with a large group of followers. On both 3 and 4 February his followers gathered in front of the Attorney General's office to demand De Kom's release. On 7 February a large crowd gathered on the Oranjeplein (currently called the Onafhankelijkheidsplein). Rumor had it that De Kom was about to be released. When the crowd refused to leave the square, police opened fire, killing two people and wounding 30.\n\nOn 10 May De Kom was sent to the Netherlands without trial and exiled from his native country. He was unemployed and continued writing his book, \"Wij slaven van Suriname\" (We Slaves of Suriname) which was published in a censored form in 1934. De Kom participated in demonstrations for the unemployed, traveled abroad with a group as a tap dancer, and was drafted for \"Werkverschaffing\" (unemployment relief work), a program similar to the American WPA, in 1939. He gave lectures for leftist groups, mainly communists, about colonialism and racial discrimination.\n\nAfter the German invasion in 1940, De Kom joined the Dutch resistance, especially the communist party in The Hague. He wrote articles for the underground paper \"De Vonk\" of the communist party, mainly about the terror of fascist groups in the streets of The Hague (much of their terror was directed against Jews). On 7 August 1944, he was arrested. He was imprisoned at the Oranje Hotel in Scheveningen, and transferred to \"Camp Vught\", a Dutch concentration camp. In early September 1944, he was sent to Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen, where he was forced to work for the Heinkel aircraft factory. De Kom died on 24 April 1945 of tuberculosis in Camp Sandbostel near Bremervörde (between Bremen and Hamburg), which was a satellite camp of the Neuengamme concentration camp. He was buried in a mass grave. In 1960, his remains were found and brought to the Netherlands. There he was buried at the Cemetery of Honours in Loenen.\n\nDe Kom was married to a Dutch woman, Petronella Borsboom. They had four children. Their son, Cees de Kom, lives in Suriname.\n\nThe University of Suriname was renamed The Anton de Kom University of Suriname in honor of De Kom.\n\nAnton de Kom was listed in De Grootste Nederlander (The Greatest Dutchman/Dutchwoman) as #102 out of 202 people.\n\nIn Amsterdam Zuidoost a square is named after him, the \"Anton de Komplein\". It features a sculpture of Anton de Kom as a monument to his life and works, sculpted by Jikke van Loon.\n\n\n \n"}

The extension of equal political rights has been accompanied by a conscious drive to promote women to positions of authority within government.\n\nThe move to give women the vote in 2002 was part of several wide-ranging political reforms that have seen the establishment of a democratically elected parliament and the release of political prisoners. Before 2002, women had no political rights and could neither vote in elections nor stand as candidates.\n\nThere was, however, some ambivalence towards the extension of political rights from sections of Bahraini society, not least from women themselves, with 60% of Bahraini women in 2001 opposing extending the vote to women.\n\nAlthough many women stood as candidates in both municipal and parliamentary elections in 2002, none were elected to office. There were no women candidates in the lists of Islamist parties such as Al Wefaq, Al-Menbar Islamic Society and Asalah.\n\nFollowing the poor performance of women candidates in the parliamentary elections, six women, including one Christian, were appointed to the upper chamber of parliament, the Shura Council. In 2004, Bahrain appointed its first female minister, Dr Nada Haffadh to the position of Health Minister, and in 2005, Dr Fatima Albalooshi, the second woman minister was appointed to the cabinet. In 2005, Houda Ezra Nonoo, a Jewish activist, who since 2004 also headed the Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society which has campaigned against the reintroduction of the death penalty in Bahrain, was also appointed to the Shura Council. In April 2005, Shura member Alees Samaan became the first woman to chair a parliamentary session in the Arab world when she chaired the Shura Council. The head of the main women's organisation, the Supreme Council for Women, Ms Lulwa Al Awadhi, has been given the title of 'honorary cabinet minister'.\n\nIn June 2006, Bahrain was elected head of the United Nations General Assembly, and appointed Haya Rashid Al Khalifa as the Assembly's President, making her the first Middle Eastern woman and the third woman in history to take over the post. Sheikha Haya is a leading Bahraini lawyer and women's rights advocate who will take over the post at a time of change for the world body. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said of her, \"I met her yesterday and I found her quite impressive. All the member states are determined to work with her and to support her, and I think she's going to bring a new dimension to the work here.\"\n\nSeveral women's rights activists have become political personalities in Bahrain in their own right, or even gained international recognition, such as Ghada Jamsheer, who was named by Forbes magazine as one of the \"ten most powerful and effective women in the Arab world\" in May 2006.\n\nGhada Jamsheer, the most prominent women's rights activist in Bahrain has called the government's reforms \"artificial and marginal\". In a statement in December 2006 she said:\nBahrain's move was widely considered to have encouraged women's rights activists in the rest of the Persian Gulf to step up demands for equality. In 2005, it was announced that Kuwaiti women would be granted equal political rights to men.\n\nEighteen female candidates stood at the 2006 Bahraini general election. Most of the female candidates ran for Leftist parties or as independents, with no Islamist party being represented by a woman, although salafist party Asalah was the only group to publicly oppose female candidature in parliamentary elections. Only one candidate, Lateefa Al Gaood, won; in her case by default before polling after her two opponents in her constituency dropped out of the race.\n\nThere is no unified personal status law in Bahrain that covers matters such as divorce and child custody, so that Sharia judges have discretion in such matters. In November 2005, the Supreme Council for Women in an alliance with other women's rights activists, began a campaign for change - organising demonstrations, putting up posters across the island and carrying out a series of media interviews.\n\nHowever, changing the law has been resisted by the leading Shia Islamist party, Al Wefaq, resulting in a major political showdown with women's rights activists. Al Wefaq argued that neither Chamber of Deputies elected MPs nor the government have the authority to change the law because these institutions could 'misinterpret the word of God'. Instead, the right to change the law is the sole responsibility of religious leaders.\n\nOn 9 November 2005, supporters of Al Wefaq claimed to have organised Bahrain's largest ever demonstration with 120,000 protesting against the introduction of the Personal Status Law, and for the maintenance of each religious group having their own divorce and inheritance laws. On the same day, an alliance of women's rights organisations held a smaller rally calling for the unified law, which attracted 500 supporters.\n\nThe issue of the introduction of a unified personal status law has divided civil society into two camps, with women's rights and human rights groups wanting its introduction, opposed by Shia Islamist groups in alliance with the wahabbi Asalah:\n\nFor:\n\nAgainst:\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

Built by Carrington Slipways and launched in 1989, the vessel is owned by P&O Maritime Services, but is regularly chartered by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) for research cruises in Antarctic waters and to support Australian bases in Antarctica.\n\nDesigned as a multi-purpose research and resupply ship, \"Aurora Australis\" was built by Carrington Slipways in Tomago, New South Wales. The vessel was launched in September 1989.\n\n\"Aurora Australis\" is long, and has a beam of , draught of and moulded depth of . Her displacement is 8,158 tons, gross tonnage 6,574 and deadweight tonnage 3,911 tons. Her propulsion machinery consists of two Wärtsilä medium-speed diesel engines in father-son arrangement, one 16-cylinder 16V32D producing 5,500 kW and one 12-cylinder 12V32D producing 4,500 kW. Both engines are coupled to a single shaft through a reduction gear, driving a single, left-hand-turning controllable-pitch propeller. Slow speed manoeuvring is achieved with three manoeuvring thrusters, one forward and two aft. \"Aurora Australis\" has a maximum speed of , and a cruising speed of . The vessel can break level ice up to thick at .\n\n\"Aurora Australis\" is served by a crew of 24 and carry up to 116 passengers accommodated in three or four-bunk cabins with attached bathrooms. The ship has a cargo capacity of for break bulk or 29 twenty-foot equivalent containers, and a supply tank that can hold of fuel. The ship is fitted with laboratories for biological, meteorological, and oceanographic research, and was designed with a trawl deck for the deployment and recovery of research instruments while at sea. The ship's hangar and helideck allow for the operation of up to three helicopters, usually Eurocopter Squirrels or Sikorsky S-76s.\n\n\"Aurora Australis\" is chartered by the AAD over the southern summer for research purposes, and to support the Antarctic bases operated by the AAD. The vessel spends most winters in port in Hobart, Tasmania, as the AAD headquarters is in the nearby town of Kingston. P&O sometimes charter the ship for other work during winter.\n\nOn 8 May 2011, \"Aurora Australis\" was chartered by the Department of Defence for a two-month deployment (ending 30 June) as an amphibious transport ship supporting the Royal Australian Navy. The charter, costing A$3.375 million, was to assist in the Australian government response to humanitarian crises and natural disasters that occurred while the naval heavy lift ship underwent maintenance.\n\nIn late December 2013, \"Aurora Australis\", Chinese research vessel \"Xuě Lóng\" and French icebreaker \"L'Astrolabe\" attempted to rescue \"Akademik Shokalskiy\", which had become stranded in thick Antarctic ice in Watt Bay. None of the three ships were able to reach the Russian icebreaker, with \"Aurora Australis\" aborting efforts on the morning of 30 December, due to the risk of the ship also becoming stuck. On 2 February, the 52 passengers from \"Akademik Shokalskiy\" were transported by helicopter to \"Aurora Australis\" by \"Xuě Lóng\"s helicopter (the Chinese icebreaker having become trapped as well). After the rescue, \"Aurora Australis\" continued on her original mission to resupply Casey Station, before returning to Hobart on 22 January.\n\nThe \"Aurora Australis\" returned from its final voyage in March 2020. After 31 years of service to the Australian Antarctic Program, the last trip was a two-week voyage to resupply Macquarie Island and transport expeditioners to the south. Suggestions have been made that the ship could be used as an emergency vessel if acquired by the Australian Government.\n\nOn 14 January 1999 whilst en route to Antarctica a fire caused by leaking high pressure diesel igniting on the hot STBD main engine caused a major fire. The fire resulted in zero visibility in the engine room and was suppressed by the release of HALON fire suppression system. Re-entry to the compartment resulted in successful restoration of power and propulsion to the ship and it returned to Fremantle under its own power for an investigation by the ATSB and major repairs.\n\nOn 24 February 2016, the vessel was damaged when it ran aground in Horseshoe Harbour, near Mawson Station, Antarctica, during a blizzard, after a shackle on a forward mooring line came undone, causing the other three lines to break. It was refloated on 27 February 2016 and returned to Western Australia for repairs.\n\nThe predicted end of service life for \"Aurora Australis\", after the most recent round of refits, is May 2017. In late October 2015, the Australian government announced a plan to acquire a new icebreaker to replace \"Aurora Australis\" by 2019. \"Nuyina\" will be custom-built for the Australian government at a cost of up to A$1 billion (\"ABC News\" reported a predicted cost of A$500 million, while \"The Sydney Morning Herald\"s reporting of the A$1 billion figure included lifetime operating costs), with DMS Maritime as the preferred tenderer and maintainer, naval architects Knud E. Hansen as the designer, and Damen Group as the shipbuilder. P&O were originally in competition for the tender, but withdrew in January 2015, citing costing inefficiencies in the proposed contract. As of October 2015, there has been no decision made on how to cover the capability gap between the two vessels.\n\n\"Nuyina\" will have a displacement of 23,800 tonnes and be long, with a top speed of and a cruising speed of . The ship will carry up to 160 crew and passengers, and a cargo capacity of , including 96 shipping containers. The vessel will be able to break ice up to at . The icebreaker is expected to be operational in 2020, and will be home-ported in Hobart for the ship's 30-year operational lifespan.\n\n"}

{"id": "2298508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298508", "title": "Gepps Cross, South Australia", "text": "Gepps Cross, South Australia\n\nGepps Cross (pronounced 'Jepps Cross') is a suburb and major road intersection in the north of Adelaide, South Australia. Gepps Cross is traditionally seen as the end of the inner suburbs and the start of the outer northern suburbs, as it was home to a major abattoir (now closed and demolished) with holding yards and other open space. It is the first significant open space encountered after the North Parklands. It retains the open nature, even with warehouses, a velodrome, hockey stadium, Adelaide Raiders – a Croatian soccer club and karate training facilities. \n\nGepps Cross is best known for the five-way intersection with Grand Junction Road going east and west, Main North Road south and north-east, and Port Wakefield Road going north. The intersection is not grade-separated. It is controlled by traffic lights, and all five roads have at least three lanes in each direction. These roads include the main highways from Adelaide to Western Australia and the Northern Territory (via Port Wakefield Road), New South Wales (via Main North Road), the northern suburbs of Adelaide and the northern parts of South Australia (both roads). Port Adelaide is to the west, and the major freight hubs are northwest of Gepps Cross. A major route from Port Adelaide towards Victoria and the south and east of South Australia is east along Grand Junction Road then south along Portrush Road to the South Eastern Freeway. It was a holding place for people that came from England in 1952 from there they went interstate to find new homes.\n\nGepps Cross was named for Isaac Gepp who arrived in South Australia in July 1840 with his wife Ann and son aboard \"Fairlie\".\nHe opened the Gepp's Cross Inn on the southwest corner of the busy intersection of Main North Road and Grand Junction Road in 1848. The earliest known record of Gepp's Cross being apparently accepted into colloquial speech as a location name without reference to the inn, was in April 1849, one year after Isaac Gepp named his 'Gepp's Cross' Inn. In a court case Dr Mayo in evidence referred to the mill at Gepp's Cross and John Harris gave his address as Gepp's Cross. In the same month William Raines, a butcher, baker and storekeeper, advertised he would supply customers at their residences at Gepp's Cross. After the names Blair Athol and Enfield were assumed, respectively, for the land on the southwest and southeast of the intersection, the placename Gepps Cross became more heavily associated with land to the north, where the present-day suburb is bounded.\n\nIn March 1848 Isaac Gepp opened an inn on the north eastern corner of land Section 360 bordered to the north and east by Grand Junction Road and Main North Road. Isaac Gepp, with his wife Ann and a child, had arrived in the province on the \"Fairlie \"in July 1840. The child passenger was probably his nephew Henry Francis Gepp (1836–1871), the natural born son of Thomas Gepp (c. 1809–1894) and Ann Francis (1816–1868). Gepp first worked as a water carrier and in 1845 he became the publican of the Windmill Inn on Great North Road near Adelaide.\n\nIn May 1846, Gepp gave notice of his application to license a new public house called the Miller's Friend on land being Part Section 360 he had acquired from William Webber the previous year. The name Miller's Friend may be linked to the Ragless flour mill on land, Part Section 97, immediately north east of the junction and Gepp's new premises. Section 360 was originally occupied by James Pitcher about 1842 and he named the land Section \"Bushy Farm\". About the time Pitcher sold the north eastern corner to Webber, John Merritt, a farmer and copper carrier for the Burra Burra mine, acquired the southern forty acres of Section 360 with a cottage and used it as a residence, to farm and to keep his working bullocks.\n\nAt the time of his licence application for the Miller's Friend, Gepp had contracted to sell his interest in the Windmill Inn to Robert Carter, the licence for which was transferred from Gepp to Carter in June 1846. Carter failed to stop Gepp's original application for the new licensed premises on Section 360; he claimed Gepp had contracted with him not to hold another licence in the neighbourhood. In March 1847 Gepp's publican's licence was renewed under the new name of the Miner's Arms. Before the licensing bench on 13 March 1848, Isaac Gepp nominated his premises to be the 'Gepp's Cross' Inn. Gepp leased his inn to Joseph Ladd in 1849 who continued to call it the Gepp's Cross Inn.\n\nCharles Matthews owned 13 acres of land, Part of Section 337, across the Main North Road from the Gepp's Cross Inn, on the south eastern corner of Gepp's Cross intersection, where he operated a blacksmith shop. In December 1848 Matthews applied for a publican's licence for the 'Blacksmiths Arms Hotel' on his premises, but Isaac Gepp objected on the grounds that two hotels being placed exactly opposite each other would probably cause the road to be obstructed by drays. The bench ruled that competition for custom would induce a disregard for order or public convenience and the application of Charles Matthews was refused. John Merritt who farmed next to the Gepp's Cross Inn and across the road from Matthew's blacksmith shop took out an option to purchase Matthews' 13-acre property. Merritt relinquished this option after he became publican of the Grand Junction Inn in 1851. In 1850 Isaac Gepp transferred his licence and lease of the Gepp's Cross Inn on land Section 360 to Charles Matthews. In 1851 Matthews dropped the former licensee's name from the inn name and changed it to the Victoria Cross. It obviously didn't sit well with the patrons who by then referred to the area around the inn as Gepp's Cross and in all likelihood continued to call the inn by its colloquial name. Matthews reverted to the accepted name in 1852. Gepp sold his Part Section 360 to Charles Matthews in November 1854 for the sum of £900, with repayment set out in the terms of a mortgage and two lease payments of £50 per year each for inn and surrounding land until the purchase was complete. Months before he purchased the Gepp's Cross Inn and land Part Section 360 Charles Matthews had let the inn run down. In March 1854 he was cautioned to keep his house in a proper state of cleanliness. By the end of 1858 Matthews was in financial difficulty and he sold one acre of his Part Section 360 bordering John Merritt's farm to the council, which wanted the land to erect a civic hall and stray animal pound. Once built the hall was used as a council office and school until 1899 when it was used as a dwelling.\n\nIn December 1859 Matthews transferred his licensed business across the Main North Road from land Section 360 to the premises on land Section 337 that in 1848 he had tried to open as the Blacksmith's Arms Hotel. Trade at the Gepp's Cross Inn on land Section 337 was poor and in April 1861 Charles Matthews was certified insolvent. Matthews defaulted in his mortgage and lease payments to Isaac Gepp who seized the Inn and land on Section 360 and Matthews' premises on Section 337 that had been put up as collateral. Between 13 June 1861 and the first week in October 1861 there was no premises licensed at Gepp's Cross. The Gepp's Cross Hotel licence was reinstated to premises on Section 360 when Patrick Connaughty was granted a publican's licence for the inn who transferred it to George Eldridge in December 1861. The premises known primarily as the Gepp's Cross Inn or Gepps Cross Hotel has been licensed at the site continuously for over 150 years.\n\nThere are multiple shopping centres with home furnishings and retail stores all grouped in the same vicinity near the intersection of Main North Road and Matthews Road. There is a drive-in movie theatre between Port Wakefield and Main North roads less than a kilometre north of the Gepps Cross intersection.\n\nGepps Cross is bounded on the south by the east–west road freight route of Grand Junction Road and is bisected east to west by the arterial Main North Road and Port Wakefield Road. \nUntil 1995 the Northfield railway line which ran along the suburb's northern boundary crossed Port Wakefield Road. The line further east crossing Main North Road had been closed in 1987.\n\nGepps Cross is home to local association football side Adelaide Raiders, participating in the South Australian National Premier Leagues for the 2014 season, as well as the North Adelaide Lacrosse Club, which is the oldest lacrosse club in South Australia and second oldest lacrosse club in Australia.\n\nThe suburb is also the location of the State Sports Park, which incorporates the State Hockey Centre, also known as The Pines, and cycling velodrome Adelaide Super-Drome, the latter of which is currently used as the base and main venue for the South Australian Futsal League (SAFL) from 2013 onwards.\n\nGepps Cross Futsal Club also takes its name from the suburb, and competes in the aforementioned South Australian Futsal League, starting in March 2014. \n"}

Cartwright in 1851, which proposed a theory for the cause of laziness among slaves. Today, dysaesthesia aethiopica is considered an example of pseudoscience, and part of the edifice of scientific racism.\n\nFound exclusively among African Americans, dysaesthesia aethiopica– \"called by overseers 'rascality'\" –was characterized by partial insensitivity of the skin and \"so great a hebetude of the intellectual faculties, as to be like a person half asleep.\" Other symptoms included \"lesions of the body discoverable to the medical observer, which are always present and sufficient to account for the symptoms.\" Cartwright contended that the existence of dysaesthesia aethiopica was \"clearly established by the most direct and positive testimony,\" but other doctors had failed to notice it because their \"attention [had] not been sufficiently directed to the maladies of the negro race.\"\n\nCartwright felt that dysaesthesia aethiopica was \"easily curable, if treated on sound physiological principles.\" Insensitivity of the skin was one symptom of the disease, so the skin should be stimulated:\nAuthor Vanessa Jackson has noted that lesions were a symptom of dysaesthesia aethiopica and \"the ever-resourceful Dr. Cartwright determined that whipping could ... cure this disorder. Of course, one wonders if the whipping were not the cause of the 'lesions' that confirmed the diagnosis.\"\n\nAccording to Cartwright, after the prescribed \"course of treatment\" the slave will \"look grateful and thankful to the white man whose compulsory power ... has restored his sensation and dispelled the mist that clouded his intellect.\"\n\nAccording to Cartwright, dysaesthesia aethiopica was \"much more prevalent among free negroes living in clusters by themselves, than among slaves on our plantations, and attacks only such slaves as live like free negroes in regard to diet, drinks, exercise, etc.\" – indeed, according to Cartwright, \"nearly all [free negroes] are more or less afflicted with it, that have not got some white person to direct and to take care of them.\" He explicitly dismissed the opinion which assigned the causes of the \"problematic\" behaviour to the social situation of the slaves without further justifications: \"[The northern physicians] ignorantly attribute the symptoms to the debasing influence of slavery on the mind.\"\n\n\n\n"}

They are considered one of the most significant bands in Guinean music. Many of their recordings are based on traditional folk music in the country and have been fused with jazz and Afropop style. Featuring guitarist Sekou \"Diamond Fingers\" Diabaté, who grew up in a traditional griot musical family, the band won over fans in Conakry, Guinea's capital city, during the heady days of that country's newfound independence. Bembeya Jazz fell onto harder times in the 1980s and disbanded for a number of years, but reformed in the late 1990s and toured Europe and North America in the early 2000s.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Guinean Independence in 1958 and through the cultural policy of \"authenticité\", which encouraged cultural pride, numerous bands were created throughout the regions of Guinea. Guinea's President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, disbanded all private dance orchestras and replaced them with state-supported groups, such as Keletigui Et Ses Tambourinis and Balla et ses Balladins. The most popular was Bembeya Jazz National, formed in 1961.\n\nBembeya Jazz, also referred to as the Orchestre de Beyla in the early days, started as the regional orchestra from the town of Beyla in southern Guinea. They were formed with the help of the local governor, Emile Kondé, to act as the region’s \"orchestre moderne\". The initial line up included Sékou Camara and Achken Kaba in the brass section on trumpets, Sékou Diabaté on guitar who was the youngest member at the time, Hamidou Diaouné on bass and Mory \"Mangala\" Condé on drums. Leo Sarkisian (who went on to join the Africa Service of the Voice of America in 1963) recorded Orchestre de Beyla in 1961 for the Hollywood based Tempo International label (Tempo 7015). The band were just being formed in Beyla and according to Sarkisian, called themselves Orchestra Bembeya, after a local river. The session also featured the female singer Jenne Camara as part of the band. The recording, one of ten Tempo LPs featuring a variety of Guinean music recorded by Sarkisian, was not released commercially. All 10 LPs were pressed in limited editions of 2,500 and released in 1962, but the majority of them were sent to the Guinean government. Bembeya's album was titled \"Sons nouveaux d'une nation nouvelle. République de Guinée. 2 Octobre 1962. 4ème anniversaire de l'independance nationale.

The group toured widely, and became one of the most well-known groups in Africa. Among their biggest hits were the songs \"Mami Wata\" and \"Armee Guineenne\".\n\nBembeya Jazz National’s most ambitious album, \"Regard Sur Le Passe\", released in 1968, was a musical tribute to the memory of Samory Touré, who founded a Mande conquest state in much of what is now northern Guinea in 1870, and who became a nationalist emblem following 1958.\n\nA live album, 10 \"Ans De Succes\", was recorded during a 1971 concert, but set-back for the band came on April 5, 1973 when Demba Camara was killed in an auto accident on his way to a concert in Dakar. Although they remained together, Bembeya Jazz National was unable to duplicate the success of their earliest years. The group disbanded in 1991 with Sekou Diabaté and Sekouba Bambino Diabaté going on to successful solo careers.\n\nThe band reformed in the late 1990s. Bembeya Jazz came together again in 2002 to perform at the Musiques Metisses d’Angoulême world music festival in France. They remained there to record their first new album in 14 years for the director of the festival, Christian Mousset's \"Marabi\" label. The album, \"Bembeya\", is a reworking of orchestra's greatest hits. They went on to tour Europe and North America.\n\nIn 2007 they were featured in the documentary film \"Sur les traces du Bembeya Jazz\".\n\nGraeme Counsel, an Honorary Fellow in the Faculty of Music at the University of Melbourne, Australia has published a complete discography for Bembeya Jazz.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1495 he produced an edition of the works of Averroes; with a commentary compatible with his acquired orthodoxy.\n\nIn the great controversy with the Alexandrists he opposed the theory of Pietro Pomponazzi, that the rational soul is inseparably bound up with the material part of the individual, and hence that the death of the body carries with it the death of the soul. He insisted that the individual soul, as part of absolute intellect, is indestructible, and on the death of the body is merged in the eternal unity.\n\nHis principal philosophical works are:\n\nHis numerous commentaries on Aristotle were widely read and frequently reprinted, the best-known edition being one printed at Paris in 1645 in fourteen volumes (including the \"Opuscula\").\n\nOther works were ' (Bologna, 1531), ' (Lyon, 1549), and a commentary on Ptolemy.\n\nThe famous phrase, to 'think with the learned, and speak with the vulgar' is attributed to Nifo.\n\n\n\n"}

S. Henderson, was half Scottish and half of the Irish family of Newenham: his mother was a Carus-Wilson from Westmorland. Both, however, were born and bred in Cornwall, and a portion of Cornish ancestry came to him through his mother's mother, one of the Willyamses of Carnanton in Mawgan-in-Pydar.\n\nHe was at Wellington College for a short time but left on account of ill-health. For this reason he was frequently sent home from school for rest, and spent a large amount of his time walking over Cornwall and studying Cornish monuments and history. He collected a large number of documents from all over the county.\n\nHenderson went to New College, Oxford and took his degree with first-class honours in modern history in 1922. He was a lecturer at University College, Exeter, and afterwards at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was elected to an official fellowship as tutor in modern history in 1929. He had settled down at Oxford, and was showing great promise as a teacher and lecturer.\n\nIn 1928 Henderson published a book on Cornish bridges in collaboration with Henry Coates. Whenever he was able he would return to Cornwall and continue his historical research which in the early years was concerned very largely with the four western hundreds (Penwith, Kerrier, Pydar and Powder) but finally he planned a parochial history of the whole county on a grand scale.\n\nOn 19 June 1933, he married (Mary) Isobel Munro, a fellow of Somerville College and daughter of J A R Munro, the Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford; at the end of August, he set out with her for southern Italy. He had been troubled for some months with pains in his chest and they attacked him severely at Monte Sant'Angelo on the Gargano, where he was visiting the shrine of the Cornish patron St Michael. He died in Rome eleven days later, on 24 September, of heart-failure following pleurisy.\n\nHe is buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, between the Porta San Paolo and Monte Testaccio, a place that he knew well: also in that cemetery are the graves of Keats, Shelley and Edward John Trelawny.\n\nHenderson’s publications included \"Cornwall; A Guide\" in collaboration with J. C. Tregarthen, in 1925; three books on Cornish churches; and another on Cornish coasts, moors, and valleys with notes on antiquities. In 1928 he was made a Bard of the Cornish Gorseth at Boscawen-Un, taking the bardic name \"Map Hendra\" ('Son of Antquity'). His collection of documents is held at the Courtney Library of the Royal Institution of Cornwall in Truro. The collection includes 16,000 ancient documents, many hundreds of transcripts in Henderson's hand, and his own writings either in published form or in manuscript.\n\nAfter completing his book on Cornish bridges, Henderson prepared notes for a similar book on the bridges of Devon. After his death the civil engineer Edwyn Jervoise completed the book and it was published in 1938.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the United States Ambassador to Belgium from April 11, 2007 until January 2, 2009. President George W. Bush appointed Fox to the post by a recess appointment on April 4, 2007.\n\nFox was born in Desloge, Missouri to Ukrainian Jewish immigrant Michel Fuks (later Max Fox), and Fanny Gold. Encouraged by an older sister to go to college, he saved money by working summers in Illinois canning peas and corn. He also sold Fuller brushes. After moving in with the sister and her husband in St.Louis, he enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis, where he joined Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. He graduated with a B.S./B.A. (Bachelor of Science, Business Administration) with honors in business in 1951. During the Korean War, he served in the United States Naval Reserve.\n\nIn 1976, Fox founded the Harbour Group, an operating company that builds and acquires businesses where he served as chairman and CEO until 2007 when he left to be the U.S. Ambassador to Belgium. Upon his return to the United States in 2009, he resumed his role as chairman. Since its inception, Harbour Group has built and acquired more than 176 companies in 37 industries.\n\nFor more than 40 years, Fox has been active in St. Louis civic affairs. He served two terms as chairman and one as president of the St. Louis Areas Council Boy Scouts of America; is former president of the board of commissioners of the Saint Louis Art Museum; and is a lifetime member of the Art Museum's board of trustees. In 2003 he also served as chair of the $63 million capital campaign of the United Way of Greater St. Louis. From 1998 to 2004 he served as chairman of a $1.5 billion capital campaign for his \"alma mater\", Washington University in St. Louis, and from 1999 to 2001 he served as vice chairman of the board of trustees. In 2004 the university's board of trustees elected him a lifetime voting trustee. He serves or has served on the boards of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Saint Louis Science Center, the Saint Louis Zoo, the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, the Arts and Education Council of St. Louis, the St. Louis Muny Opera, and Forest Park Forever. In 2003 he was named St. Louis Citizen of the Year by the Post-Dispatch and a committee of the award's former recipients.\n\nOutside of St.Louis, Fox serves on the boards of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, based in Alexandria, Virginia; the King Baudouin Foundation United States, a New York-based nonprofit that helps U.S. donors achieve their philanthropic goals in Europe and Africa; and The Washington Center, the largest independent, nonprofit academic internship program in the United States. In addition, through the Fox Family Foundation, a private philanthropy he and his wife established in 1986, Fox has provided financial assistance to hundreds of charitable organizations in St. Louis and around the world.\n\nFox has also received numerous other honors and awards, including the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship, the Marco Polo Award from the People's Republic of China, the Thomas Jefferson Award from the Missouri Historical Society, and the Sword of Ignatius Loyola Award from Saint Louis University. In 2004, Washington University dedicated its new Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts, and also awarded him with an honorary doctorate of laws degree. Saint Louis University awarded Fox an honorary doctorate of public service in 2000.\n\nA major donor to the Republican Party, Fox was a Bush Pioneer in 2000 and a \"Ranger\" in 2004, categories for donors who recruit others to donate. On October 15, 2004, Fox donated $50,000 to Swift Boat Veterans For Truth (\"SBVT\"), a 527 group that opposed John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election by claiming that Kerry exaggerated his service record. The SBVT has, in turn, been criticized for allegedly failing to substantiate many of their claims. Fox noted that he made the donation after comparisons of President Bush to Adolph Hitler were posted on the website MoveOn.org. (See Ambassadorial nomination section below.)\n\nIn later elections, Fox supported of the presidential candidacy of Mitt Romney and remained one of the most prominent Jewish donors to the Republican party. Fox is a past chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition. President George W. Bush appointed Sam and Marilyn Fox to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.\n\nFox was nominated for the position of Ambassador to Belgium in December 2006. During his February 2007 hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Fox was supported by both of Missouri's senators, Republican Kit Bond and Democrat Claire McCaskill, as well as by two former U.S. Senators from Missouri, John C. Danforth (Rep.) and Thomas F. Eagleton (Dem.). Danforth described him as \"very bright...ebullient...(and) a soft touch,\" while Eagleton, in a letter, called him \"the epitome of a humanitarian.\" Fox faced lengthy questioning from John Kerry, the target of attacks by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group to which Fox contributed in 2004. Kerry told Fox that he represented \"the quintessential American Horatio Alger story\" and that his experience was \"impressive... (and) a lot more than some people bring to this table.\"\n\nKerry interrogated Fox for approximately 35 minutes, however, beginning with 20 minutes of questioning directly pertinent to the ambassadorial position for which Fox was nominated, such as the tensions over the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program which accessed transaction databases of the SWIFT network. Kerry continued with a series of questions related to Fox's financial support of SBVT, a 527 organization which had criticized Kerry's military record during the 2004 campaign. In response to the question from Kerry, \"I assume that you believe the truth in public life is important,\" Fox answered, \"Yes, sir.\" Kerry then followed with, \"And might I ask you what your opinion is with respect to the state of American politics, as regards the politics of personal destruction?\" to which Fox replied \"I'm against 527s, I've always been against 527s...Senator Kerry, I very much respect your dedicated service to this country... Senator, you're a hero.\" In response to follow up questions from Kerry, Fox said he had given to the 527 that attacked him because \"when we're asked we generally give.\" For example, he said, in the most recent two-year period, he had made more than 1,000 contributions, of which more than 100 were political. He did not express regret for his contribution to SBVT. He noted that 527s supporting both candidates in the electorate had made \"mean and destructive\" claims, and that a video posted on the MoveOn.com website has compared the President to Hitler. He said that as long as one side was making such claims, \"politically it's necessary.\"\n\nOn April 4, 2007, while the Senate was in recess, Bush used his power of recess appointment to appoint Fox to the position. This made Fox ambassador until the end of the next session of Congress, and effectively made him ambassador for the remainder of the Bush presidency.\n\nSeveral Democratic Senators criticized Bush's decision to make a recess appointment when the nomination was no longer pending before Congress. They also argued that this use of the recess appointment power was illegal because of statutory restrictions applicable to ambassadorships.\n\nThree Democratic senators wrote a letter to the Government Accountability Office on April 5, 2007, calling for an investigation of whether President Bush's appointment of Sam Fox as U.S. ambassador to Belgium the previous day was legal. The letter, submitted by Democrats Chris Dodd of Connecticut, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, read: \"We view the recess appointment of Mr. Fox as a clear abuse of the President's recess appointment power.\" Dodd argued that the law that enables the president to make recess appointments was not created to get around the approval of the Senate. \"This is really now taking the recess appointment vehicle and abusing this beyond anyone's imagination,\" Dodd said, according to AP. \"This is a travesty.\" He said in a statement that what the President did was \"deceptive at best and illegal at worst.\" \n\nThe GAO, however, responded with an eight-page letter dated June 8, 2007, that the appointment had been legal. Indeed, the letter said \"an alternative interpretation that would preclude Mr. Fox from serving in a recess appointment would raise serious constitutional questions.\"\n\nFox served as Ambassador from April 2007 to January 2009. In December 2009, the U.S. Department of State's Office Inspector General filed its official report on his tenure. The report noted that Fox had \"come to his job with significant and relevant executive leadership in the private sector.\" It continued:\n\n\"By all accounts, he used his business acumen and experience to excellent effect, notably in two areas. The first was in building important relationships with both the Belgian and American business communities, and with senior Belgian Government officials charged with financial and trade matters. The second was his active and visible outreach to the Belgian community to improve the image and standing of the United States at a time when both were suffering as a result of Belgian misgivings about U.S. policies, such as the Iraq war. His efforts in both areas were judged highly successful.\"\n\nThe report gave Fox particularly high marks for \"shepherding to production a 20-minute film that highlights the closeness of Belgian-U.S. ties from the early 19th century. The film continues to play well to Belgian audiences and has been employed effectively to counter anti-American sentiment.\"\n\nIn 2012, three years after his term as Ambassador had ended, Fox's contributions were recognized with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown, bestowed by King Albert II.\n\n\n"}

He attended elementary school in Piastów. In 1931 he was accepted to the Stefan Batory Gymnasium in Warsaw, where the Bytnar family moved in the same year. They lived in the Mokotów district.\n\nIn 1934, at the age of 13, he joined the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association.

Visitors to Colourscapes, wearing coloured cloaks, choose the journey they make through the interconnected chambers, becoming part of the sculpture, as the colour they wear changes as they move, dynamically altering the space that others see. Inside Colourscape, people are entirely surrounded by colour, which is transmitted from the inner surfaces as daylight filters through the plastic membrane from which Colourscape is made. This immersion in colour is an intense experience giving rise to interesting perceptual phenomena and emotional richness.\n\nThe first Colourscape was made in 1971 by Peter Jones, and since 1978 Lynne Dickens has collaborated with him. Their partnership (Cwmni Colourscape) has developed more complex and larger Colourscapes while experimenting with different ways of showing the structures. They began to explore the relationship between colour, sound and movement from 1977, collaborating with musicians, dancers and singers. Since 1971, 36 different Colourscapes have been made and shown all over the UK and in Ireland, Australia, Germany, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Belgium, Switzerland and Finland.\n\nColourscapes are hand-tailored from flexible vinyl sheet. They are part welded, using high frequency machines and part hand made, using liquid and other glues.\n\nThe largest Colourscape (Festival 1) was made in 1994/1995, as a commission from the Nettlefold Trust (later becoming EyeMusic Trust), by the directors Simon Desorgher and Lawrence Casserley. Previous to this, since 1989 Colourscapes had been used once a year by the Nettlefold Festival as a venue for performance, and from 1995 the Colourscape Music Festival was born and continues on Clapham Common and other places. The collaboration between Cwmni Colourscape and EyeMusic has also led to other commissions. The smallest Colourscapes are specifically created for schools workshops. In 2011, there are 6 Colourscapes in existence.\n\nOver the years Colourscapes have been visited by thousands of people and Cwmni Colourscape now has a `social document` of visitors comments showing a shifting awareness of colour over the years. The belief that colour is powerful, capable of changing perception, stimulating creativity and that it is important to give people a harmonious and beautiful experience remains at the heart of Colourscapes` existence. Also that the form of Colourscapes made possible the installation in public places so being accessible to many.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298624", "title": "One Love Peace Concert", "text": "One Love Peace Concert\n\nThe One Love Concert was a large concert held on 22 April 1978 at The National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nThis concert was held during a political civil war in Jamaica between opposing parties Jamaican Labour Party and the People's National Party. The concert came to its peak during Bob Marley & The Wailers' performance of \"Jammin'\", when Marley joined the hands of political rivals Michael Manley (PNP) and Edward Seaga (JLP).\n\nSince he was elected Prime Minister of Jamaica in 1972, Michael Manley pursued a socialist agenda intended to redistribute wealth by nationalizing the country's major export industries. His agenda proved to be financially unsustainable, as his policies deterred foreign investment in Jamaica. Manley was also aggressively opposed by the CIA and American business interests, as had happened to similar reformist governments in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and multiple other countries throughout the Americas. Beginning in 1974, he was also opposed by the more conservative Edward Seaga of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), and the two politicians hired local gangsters to help them increase their hold on power.\n\nIronically, the idea for the One Love Peace Concert came from two such gangsters from rival political factions, who happened to be locked up in the same jail cell together and who both wanted to alleviate the violence. Claudius 'Claudie' Massop (JLP) and Aston 'Bucky' Marshall (PNP) decided that the best means to bring the country together was to use music as a uniting factor and organize a major concert. Quickly realizing that Bob Marley, living in exile in London, was a critical element upon which their success depended, Massop flew to London after being released from jail to convince Marley to perform at the event. Marley accepted the invitation, and the concert was Marley's first performance in Jamaica since the \"Smile Jamaica\" concert held days after he was shot in 1976.\n\nThe One Love Peace Concert brought together 16 of Reggae's biggest acts, and was dubbed by the media as the \"Third World Woodstock\", \"Bob Marley plays for Peace\" and simply, \"Bob Marley Is Back.\" The concert attracted more than 32,000 spectators with the proceeds of the show going towards \"much needed sanitary facilities and housing for the sufferahs in West Kingston.\" The concert was kicked off at exactly 5:00 PM with a message from Asfa Wossen, the crown prince of Ethiopia, praising the concert organizers’ efforts to restore peace in Jamaica. This introduction to the event is important in illustrating the growing prevalence of the Rastafari movement in everyday Jamaican culture. The concert was divided into two halves, with the first half devoted to showcasing some of Reggae's newer talent, and the second half devoted to the more established artists.\n\nJacob Miller energetically launched the second half of the concert, during which time Edward Seaga and Michael Manley got to their seats. The highlight of Miller's performance came when he \"leaped onto the field with lighted spliff herb and offered it to a police man, donned the lawman’s helmet, jumped back onto the stage and continued the number as he paraded the herb.\" Alternatively, Peter Tosh took the opportunity during his performance to berate the two political leaders sitting directly in front of him for their positions against legalizing marijuana. His set lasted 66 minutes, and Tosh spent almost half of that time denouncing the problems prevalent in society. At around 12:30 AM, Bob Marley took the stage to perform some of his biggest hits. The climax came during his performance of Jammin’ when he called both Manley and Seaga to the stage, and in a symbolic gesture, the three held up their hands together to signify their unity.\n\nBob Marley said the following as he called the two politicians onstage, and while he held their hands above his head and said while improvising on \"Jammin'\":\n\nUnfortunately, the event did little to quell the political violence. The event's two organizers, Claude Massop and Marshall were both killed within two years after the concert. The following election year in 1980 would see 889 reported murders in Jamaica, over 500 more than the previous year.\n\n\n\n"}

It won both the 1993 Nebula Award for Best Novelette and the 1994 Hugo Award for Best Novelette.\n\nThe novelette involves two major themes: being widowed and the quest for a legendary Babbage computer. The \"Georgia\" of the title is the remote South Georgia Island which lies just north of Antarctica.\n\nThe narrator, a computer scientist, gets a letter from former colleague Bill Rigley indicating that he has discovered components of an analytical engine which was apparently built in rural New Zealand in the mid 19th century. Traveling to New Zealand, the narrator is shown the machinery, which was discovered under a farm house near Dunedin as well as a book of scientific drawings and a journal. The journal contains entries written by someone with the initials L.D. who is in a romantic relationship with someone else, also with the initials L.D. One of them, a woman, built the analytical engine, the other drew the nature drawings. The narrator begins reading the journal. It is an account written by Luke Derwent who had fled to New Zealand with his half sister Louisa Derwent after the two fell in love and married. While Louisa builds her analytical engine, Luke explores the southern ocean with the help of Maori guides. On one of these explorations, Luke meets beings who the Maori call \"the cold loving people\". While these beings lack the \"outward aspect\" of humans, they are clearly intelligent and have amazing machines, including powerful medicine. Louisa takes sick and Luke determines to travel with her to the base of the \"cold loving people\" so that they may heal her. Bill shows the narrator a picture which Luke drew of the beings, which Louisa had named \"Heteromorphs\", showing them to be spider-like creatures about three feet tall. The narrator and Bill use information provided in Luke's journal to calculate that the Heteromorphs' base was on South Georgia Island. They begin planning a mission to South Georgia, hoping to beat several other groups which, having heard of the discovery, are planning to make their way to the island.\n"}

Though Honda's official model designations are typically Z50A, Z50J, Z50M, Z50R, and ZB50, they are commonly called the Monkey or Gorilla because small frame's cramped riding posture, suggesting a simian crouch. Sales of the bike began in March 1964 with the Z50M model, and production ended in 2017.\n\nMost Z-series bikes are small, light, collapsible motorcycles made for convenience and ease of transportation. They have overhead cam four-stroke engines with an . Some have a centrifugal clutch and a three-gear manual transmission, while others have conventional manual clutch and a three- or four-speed gearbox. \n\nThe original model of the Honda Z-series was originally produced as a children's ride at a Japanese amusement park, but was eventually refined and put into mass production, hitting the European market in 1967. \n\nSince then, Honda has produced a wide variety of Honda Z-series minibikes, with annual model updates still in effect. Starting from 2008, the well-known 50-cc engine will be adapted and fitted with an injection kit instead of carburetor. Today, cheaper replica versions of this bike are being manufactured in China. \n\nMonkey bike is the name given by Honda to one of their small, low-powered motorcycles introduced in the 1960s. The first Honda Monkey was the 1961 Z100. Later Monkeys were designated Z50, such as the Z50A(US), J, M, R(US) and Z.\n\nThese vehicles all had a , , single horizontal cylinder, four-stroke engine, and a seat height less than . The first Monkey bikes did not have any suspension, but the front forks were soon added. By 1974, when the Z50J was introduced (US 1972 Z50AK3), suspension had been added to the rear, as well. The first Monkey bikes had wheels, but later models had wheels.\n\nThe early Z series Mini Trails are still highly popular, decades after the end of production, often selling for several times their original price. Refurbishment and upgrade parts are available from a variety of sources and vendors. \n\nThe low power of the 49cc engine used in the Mini Trail and Super Cub has resulted in numerous upgrade possibilities, including replacement with larger and newer Honda horizontal engines.\n\nIn March of 2017, Honda Motorcycle president Chiaki Kato announced that the Z50 series would be discontinued in August 2017, due to new and pending emission-control regulations in Japan, which would be very difficult for small-displacement engines to meet. The model would be retired with the release of a limited-run 50th Anniversary Special Edition, which was only available to Japanese consumers. An online lottery, open from July 21 to August 21, was used to select buyers of the 500 units, which sold for ¥432,000 (about $3,900) including consumption tax. This final model of the Z50 mixed aspects of the Z50A (1968) and the Z50AK3 (1972) with a plaid-covered seat duplicating the original Z50M, and most parts were chrome plated.\n\nNumerous similar small motorcycles predate the Honda model, notably the World War II Welbike motorcycle used by parachutists, and limited numbers of minibikes powered by repurposed lawnmower and chainsaw engines were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. This type of design did not become commonplace or popular until the introduction of the mass-produced Z series.\n\nThe Honda Dax model (the ST series in the North American market) is generally not considered a Monkey, but rather a bigger, two-seat variant, with larger wheels and usually a larger engine. The Dax models have a monocoque stamped sheet-metal frame, similar to some other early Honda motorcycles. This also houses the fuel tank, battery, and wiring loom.\n\nWhile Honda has ended production, there are several similar trail bikes being produced in China; some are parts-compatible with original Hondas.\n\nIn 2018, Honda introduced the Honda Monkey (as the 2019 model year). While actually based on the Honda Grom, the model name, styling and paint scheme are directly inspired by the early Z series.\n\n"}

At the age of nine, he was hit by a car; he was expected to die or suffer severe brain damage, but surprised doctors by recovering full mental faculties.\n\nWhile Waylett was a student at Emmanuel Primary School, his photograph was taken as part of a general auditioning process for the \"Harry Potter\" films. Initially considered for the part of Dudley Dursley, he was cast as Vincent Crabbe after an audition in front of director Chris Columbus. In August 2009, his \"Harry Potter\" co-star Joshua Herdman announced that Waylett would not return for \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\", or for the final film in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\".\n\nOn 7 April 2009, Waylett and a friend were pulled over by police. The officers then searched their vehicle, finding a knife and eight bags of cannabis. Images on a camera led police to Waylett's mother's house, where additional cannabis plants were discovered being grown. Waylett was charged a month later for possession of the drug. He appeared in court on 16 July and pleaded guilty to growing the plants in his mother's home, but claimed that they were for his personal use and not for distribution. On 21 July, he was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. He had previously been accused of using cocaine in October 2006.\n\nOn 14 October 2011, Waylett was arrested for his participation in the 2011 England riots. The Metropolitan Police charged him with \"violent disorder, having an article with intent to destroy or damage property, and receiving stolen goods\". He was specifically accused of possessing a Molotov cocktail while looting a chemist in Chalk Farm, London. He was also charged with growing cannabis after police found fifteen plants during a search of his home. On 20 March 2012, he was sentenced to two years in prison for taking part in the riots. \n\n"}

{"id": "2298691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298691", "title": "The Martian Child", "text": "The Martian Child\n\n\"The Martian Child\" is a novella by American writer David Gerrold, originally published in \"Fantasy & Science Fiction\". It won the 1995 Hugo Award for Best Novelette, Locus Award and HOMer Award and the 1994 Nebula Award for Best Novelette, and was nominated for the Theodore Sturgeon award for best short fiction. The novelette was expanded into a novel and made into an eponymous film.\n\nA single man who writes science fiction books and screenplays for a living, adopts a son who claims he is from Mars. The adoptive father comes to be intrigued by the possibility his son might really be a Martian. Ultimately, the father realizes that he loves his son whether or not he is a Martian. The son uses a magical \"Martian wish\" to be a human so he can remain with his father.\n\nThe story is based on the author's own experiences as a single adoptive parent, with most of the key moments drawn from actual events.\n\nThe main difference between the story and Gerrold's own experience is that Gerrold's son, Sean Friedman, never actually believed he was a Martian; the Martian identity was simply a game that the two of them played. The initial idea for the story actually came from the author overhearing another adoptive parent remark that her daughter had told her teacher that she [the adoptive daughter] was really a Martian. Although nothing specifically science fictional occurs in the story, Gerrold makes suggestive hints.\n\nDavid Gerrold was out about his homosexuality when he adopted his son. In the novelette, the sexuality of the protagonist is not disclosed although the novel identifies him as gay. In the feature film, the protagonist was a straight widower (with a female love interest), causing criticism from the LGBT community.\n"}

It tells the story of a well-planned robbery of cash from an armored car when it stops at a sports stadium. The heist goes awry and a tough Los Angeles cop sets off in hot pursuit of the culprits.\n\nMastermind Dave Purvis (William Talman) is a professional criminal who devises a scheme to rob an armored car on its last pickup of the day. He recruits Benny McBride, who brings Mapes & Foster to complete the gang of thieves.\n\nBenny needs money because Yvonne (Adele Jergens), his striptease artist wife, has lost interest in him and is seeing another man. Unbeknownst to Benny, the man she is two-timing him with is Purvis.\n\nThe robbery itself, at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, begins as planned but goes badly wrong when a passing police patrol car intervenes. Purvis kills one of the police officers from the patrol car and he and his fellow robbers make their getaway. Lt. Jim Cordell (Charles McGraw), the dead policeman's partner, takes it upon himself to bring in his partner's killer and throws himself into the case, assisted by a rookie officer.\n\nMeanwhile, Purvis's gang unravels bit by bit as distrust and paranoia begins to build. Benny, wounded by police during the heist, is killed by Purvis as he demands his share of the loot from the robbery and attempts to seek medical help. Foster is killed by the police as the three attempt escape. After Mapes (Steve Brodie) gets away, he looks up Yvonne at the Burly Q where she works, intending to use her as a means to find Purvis, who has kept all the loot for himself. The waiting police, however, arrest Mapes at the Burly Q and learn Purvis's identity.\n\nAfter a further manhunt, Lt. Cordell and his team corner Purvis and Yvonne at Los Angeles Metropolitan Airport, and Purvis is crushed by a taking-off plane as he tries to escape across the runway.\n\n\nThe film was based on a story by Charles Pete and Richard Carroll about a $500,000 robbery, based on a true story - the 1934 robbery at Rubel Ice Company. Originally called \"Gravesend Bay\" it was sold to RKO in March 1949. Robert Ryan was meant to play John Ryan.\n\nThe studio retitled it \"Code No 3\". \n\nIn August 1949 Earl Felton was assigned to write the script. Herman Schlom was producer and Richard Fleischer was to direct.\n\nCharles McGraw was cast in December 1949.\n\nThe film was filmed on location in Los Angeles, California over 16 days. Locations include Wrigley_Field (Los Angeles) and the Metropolitan Airport.\n\n\"Variety\" magazine gave the film a mixed review, calling it an okay film, and wrote, \"RKO has concocted an okay cops-and-robbers melodrama ...[and] McGraw, Don McGuire and James Flavin, as cops, do very well. Talman and his cohorts put plenty of color into their heavy assignments. Adele Jergens attracts as a stripteaser and Talman's romantic interest\".\n\n\"Time Out Film Guide\" review lauded the film and called the it \"a model of its time\". They wrote, \"Almost documentary in its account of the heist that goes wrong and the police procedures that are set in motion, making excellent use of LA locations, it relies on superb high contrast lighting to meld reality into the characteristic noir look\".\n\nAccording to American studies and film professor, Bob Porfirio, \"Armored Car Robbery\" possesses the \"film noir visual style\" of the many RKO crime and suspense films of the early 1950s, such as: high-contrast photography integrating studio and location shooting, expressionistic lighting, deep focus, and haunting music (by Roy Webb).\n\nFilm critic Roger Fristoe believed director Richard Fleischer pushed the boundaries of the Motion Picture Production Code. One edict was, \"Methods of crime shall not be explicitly presented or detailed in a manner calculated to...inspire imitation.\" \"Armored Car Robbery\", however, had a blunt title, explicit violence and a detailed account of the planning and execution of the crime. As such, even though the criminals are caught, \"Armored Car Robbery\" tested the waters and helped set the stage for other \"films noir\" and heist films like \"The Asphalt Jungle\" (1950) and \"The Killing\" (1956) which shares some similarities.\n\nWarner Bros. released the film on DVD on July 13, 2010, in its \"Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 5\".\n\n"}
