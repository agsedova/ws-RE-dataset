{"id": "2103764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103764", "title": "Batman: Dark Victory", "text": "Batman: Dark Victory\n\nBatman: Dark Victory is a 14-part American comic book limited series (including a #0 issue) published by DC Comics, featuring the superhero Batman. The series, which ran from 1999 until 2000, was written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale, and it serves as a sequel to \"\". \"Batman: Dark Victory\" takes place primarily three to four years into Batman's career as a vigilante crimefighter. The plot centers on a series of murders involving Gotham City police officers by a mysterious serial killer only known as the Hangman. Central to the storyline is a territory war between Two-Face and the remnants of the Falcone mob, led by Sofia Falcone.\n\nThe story is also a re-telling of the origins of Batman's sidekick Robin and his adoption by Bruce Wayne. The story brings closure to many characters introduced in Frank Miller's \"\".\n\nThere is also a sequel, \"\", by Chuck Dixon and Scott Beatty.\n\nIn 2004, Loeb and Sale produced a follow-up titled \"\", focusing on Catwoman's movements in Italy. The story takes place during the events of \"Dark Victory\", between Valentine's Day (when Catwoman leaves Gotham) and Labor Day.\n\nIt has been several months after the killer known as \"Holiday\" was apprehended. \"Holiday\" was actually Alberto Falcone, attempting to one-up his father, and prove he is more than capable of handling the family business. Janice Porter has replaced Harvey Dent as Gotham City's District Attorney and despises Batman's methods, although Commissioner Gordon tries to sway her opinion.\n\nBruce blames himself for letting Harvey go beyond saving and become a villain himself, serving time in Arkham Asylum, like many of the people Dent put there. Batman becomes even more of a loner, refusing Gordon's assistance, and Catwoman's. During a visit to Dent's cell, there is a large breakout of most of the inmates of Arkham. Alberto is not one of them. Batman insists Sofia Gigante had some hand in the breakout, but she assures him she does not, as since their last visit she now uses a wheelchair and has a brace on her head.\n\nJanice Porter allows the release of Alberto to house arrest in his brother Mario's custody at their father's old estate. Shortly after his release, Clancy O'Hara's body is found hanged from the Gotham city bridge, his old patrol. Taped to his chest is a newspaper clipping, headlined \"Holiday goes free\", with a hangman riddle written on it.\n\nBatman interrogates the Riddler, the only man who Holiday did not kill, but he assures Batman that he has not the faintest idea as to why Holiday did not kill him. In the Falcone estate, Alberto begins to hear his father's voice, telling him to continue his work as the Holiday killer. Soon after the Riddler meets with Batman, saying that the killer assumes that another person is playing their twisted game, the corrupt ex-commissioner Gillian B. Loeb is found hanged from his stairs in his mansion, another riddle is on his chest.\n\nLater, another hanging, another corrupt officer, Detective Flass is found hanged outside the strip club where he worked as a bouncer. Batman believes that Alberto is the newly dubbed \"Hangman\" killer, or knows who the person is. He interrogates him, but learns nothing and leaves to search for Harvey Dent.\n\nEntering the sewers, Batman fights Solomon Grundy, and he leads Batman to Harvey's new office. Searching his office, there is an explosion and Batman loses Two-Face underground. In Gordon's office, he is talking and trying to persuade Janice to accept Batman, and she agrees, as long as he follows the law.\n\nAnother hanging, Sgt. Pratt with another note on his chest. All of the notes have come from Harvey's old desk as the D.A.; all of the evidence suggests that he is the killer.\n\nDuring the \"Hangman\" killings, Bruce is also struggling with his relationship with Selina Kyle, so much so that she eventually leaves Gotham and only left him a note.\n\nJanice Porter has been shown meeting a mysterious man several times throughout the investigation, and it is eventually revealed to be Harvey. Another hanging is found, this time in front of Harvey's old house. Officer Merkel is found with another note on his chest. Harvey, now completely taken over by his darker side, conducts his own investigation throughout the escaped criminals, questioning all of them as to the identity of the Hangman killer. Gordon is almost hanged on the roof of the precinct, but is saved by Two-Face who assures the men that he is not the Hangman killer.\n\nMultiple attacks on organized crime by the Joker are perpetrated, and he eventually assaults the Falcone estate, attacking the members of the family before being apprehended by Batman. Another hanging is found inside the garage of the precinct. Batman adopts a young Dick Grayson as his family is killed during a mob sabotage, and he begins his training to be his partner.\n\nDuring a police raid on the underground hideout of Two-Face, Batman assists Gordon and they eventually catch him. During all of which, Alberto is still hearing his father's voice telling him to continue his work. He is eventually pushed to the point of almost committing the murder of his sister, but resists the temptation. Two-Face is put on trial, but escapes when the other criminals assault the court.\n\nAnother hanging of a police officer, and Two-Face is still the prime suspect. Janice is kidnapped by the Joker and the Scarecrow, and when she argues with Two-Face, he kills her. They dump the body into Alberto Falcone's bed, to convince him he killed her. Finally, he breaks the facade and it is revealed that the Calendar Man had secretly placed microphones all over the house and manipulated him.\n\nBatman investigates Mario Falcone's penthouse, and is almost hanged but frees himself due to metal braces to protect his neck, and attacks Catwoman. She reveals that she investigated Sofia Gigante, and that she could find no record of her visiting a physical therapist, despite the fact that she uses a wheelchair. After escaping the estate, Sofia and Alberto meet inside the family mausoleum; she smothers him, telling him he is not a real Falcone.\n\nAt the Batcave, Dick correctly translates the clues left behind that they refer to protecting the Falcone crime family, and Batman scrambles to leave. At his hideout, Two-Face is attacked when several explosions rip through his lair; the criminals attempt to escape when Two-Face is attacked. Finally, the Hangman killer is revealed as Sofia Gigante. She had killed everyone who had helped Harvey to become the District Attorney and further his career, and left clues to make it look like it was him all along. Her final ploy was to pretend to be paraplegic, leaving her as the last suspect. During the ensuing fight, Sofia is shot by Two-Face and Batman gives chase.\n\nDick intervenes, now wearing a uniform as \"Robin\", and he assists Batman in the recapture of the criminals. Joker shoots Two-Face, and he falls presumably to his death. Mario Falcone, now a broken man, torches his family's estate, leaving his family destroyed. Selina Kyle arrives at Carmine's grave, and confesses the truth that she knows that he was her father, but cannot prove it yet. Two-Face is revealed to have Carmine Falcone's body, and it was frozen, presumably, by Mr. Freeze. Dick takes an oath with Batman in the Batcave to help him in his crusade against crime.\n\nIn the introduction to the trade paperback, Tim Sale states that he was hesitant to join with Jeph Loeb on the project as he did not care for Robin, given his stark contrast to Sale's interpretation of Batman. Loeb, however, insisted that the teaming of the two characters was essential to the story. A major theme of the story concerns how the three protagonists of \"The Long Halloween\" now feel alone. Throughout the book Batman struggles with this, his refusal to accept help from Commissioner Gordon, as well as with his fear of being wrong, a side-effect of the Scarecrow's fear gas. Catwoman even slaps Batman when he shows no interest in what might happen to Two-Face. Dick Grayson is depicted in the story as one of Bruce Wayne's only anchors left to humanity.\n\nCritical reaction to \"Dark Victory\" has been mostly positive.\n\nHilary Goldstein of IGN Comics said that \"\"Dark Victory\" is not quite as good as \"\"\" and added that \"it's too heavily dependent on the original to stand on its own\", but praised how \"Dark Victory\" \"uses the events of \" to further explore the psychological makeup of the Dark Knight\" and \"add[s] new context to the Batman we all know and love.\" Goldstein later ranked \"Dark Victory\" #10 on a list of the 25 best Batman graphic novels, but the list has been updated since its release in 2005 and is now ranked at #7.\n\nDave Wallace of Comics Bulletin said that \"Dark Victory\" \"doesn't quite live up to the high standards set by \"The Long Halloween\"\" but praised \"Loeb's note-perfect understanding of what makes the Batman tick\" and added that \"Tim Sale's artwork also keeps on hitting new highs.\" Wallace concluded that \"Dark Victory\" is \"definitely worthy of your attention and a place on your bookshelf.\"\n\nSion Smith of Counter Culture said that \"where \"Dark Victory\" really works is in its patience. Its willingness to let the story go where it needs to in its own time is a godsend\", and added that \"Tim Sale's depiction of a city at war with itself is one of the freshest views of Gotham we've seen in a long time, while Loeb's storytelling is as fluent as I've come to expect from him.\"\n\n\"Dark Victory\", along with its predecessor \"The Long Halloween\", are personal favorites of \"Dark Knight Trilogy\" star Christian Bale, and served as prime inspirations for his take on playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.\n"}

{"id": "2103792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103792", "title": "Fort Rouillé", "text": "Fort Rouillé\n\nFort Rouillé was a French trading post located in what is now Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Fort Rouillé was constructed by the French in 1751, building upon the success of a trading post they established in the area a year earlier, known as Fort Toronto. Fort Rouillé was named for Antoine Louis Rouillé, who at the time of its establishment was Secretary of State for the Navy in the administration of King Louis XV of France. It served as a trading post with the local indigenous peoples from the region.\n\nFort Rouillé was evacuated and burnt down by its French garrison after the French defeat at Fort Niagara in July 1759, during the French and Indian War. The remains of the fort were demolished in the 19th century. The fort site is now part of the public lands of Exhibition Place. The location is marked by an obelisk monument, with the outline of the fort marked in concrete.\n\nDuring the late-17th and 18th centuries, the area surrounding Toronto was frequently used by French fur traders as a shortcut to the upper Great Lakes and the area north of Toronto. In an attempt to secure the trade route from the British, the French established Magasin Royal (Fort Douville), a trading post along the Humber River near Baby Point. Completed in 1720, the trading post was abandoned shortly after the British Fort Oswego was completed in 1727, which had diverted trade away from Magasin Royal.\n\nIn 1750, the French built another trading post near the mouth of the Humber River, with the intention of diverting aboriginals using the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail from proceeding to the British fort in Oswego, New York. Known as Fort Toronto (or Fort Portneuf), the trading post saw immediate success, with demand outstripping the supply of goods that the post was able to provide. Fort Toronto was built by Pierre Robineau de Portneuf and was located west of Grenadier Pond, next to Jean-Baptiste Rousseau's home at the start of the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. This encampment was typical of other New France installations in that it commanded an old riverine trade route.\n\nThe success of Fort Toronto persuaded the Governor General of New France, the Marquis de la Jonquière, to order the construction of a larger fort, with more trading capacity and military potential, in an effort to consolidate France's hold of the region and its trade routes. Fort Rouillé, located on the site of present-day Exhibition Place, was completed in the spring of 1751. The new fort was named for Antoine Louis Rouillé, Comte de Jouy and French Minister of Marine and Colonies from 1749 to 1753. It was also known as Fort Toronto, since it replaced the small trading post that was built in 1750.\n\nThe fort's construction had been ordered to further establish a French presence in the area, and to intercept the trade of indigenous people travelling towards a British fur-trading post in present-day Oswego. According to a report of the Abbé Picquet, the indigenous people received a larger amount of silver for their beavers at Oswego. Although they preferred French brandy, this was not enough to dissuade the natives from going to Oswego. \"To destroy the trade there, the King's posts ought to have been supplied with the same goods as Chouegen (Oswego) and at the same price.\" Learning that the indigenous people travelled south along the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, the decision was made to locate the fort at Toronto.\n\nAbbé Picquet visited Rouillé in 1752. He found good bread and wine there and it was better-equipped than other outposts. The Mississaugas there expressed a wish for Picquet to build a church there; they had only been built a canteen. Picquet had worked among the Iroquois south of the lake and the Mississaugas felt that the Iroquois had been better treated.\n\nIn 1756, war was declared between Britain and France. In 1757, with the garrison elsewhere, the Mississaugas looted the fort. A message was sent to Fort Niagara and the French returned the next day to take back the fort. The Mississaugas confessed to the plot, saying that they thought the French had been driven out and they were taking items away from the British. According to a report of a Captain Pierre Pouchot, he believed that they had only wanted the French brandy.\n\nIn 1758, the order was given to reinforce Fort Niagara and all men and loyal natives were called to defend it. The fort continued to operate until 1759, during the Seven Years' War. The fort's garrison was instructed to evacuate and burn Fort Rouillé should Fort Niagara be captured. Following the French defeat at Fort Niagara in July 1759, the garrison at Fort Rouillé burnt down the fort, and withdrew to Montreal. After the fall of Fort Niagara in July 1759, the British under Lieutenant Francis came to Rouillé and found only burnt timbers.\n\nAfter the destruction of Fort Rouillé, no attempt was made to re-establish a settlement in the vicinity until more than thirty years later, when Governor Simcoe laid down the foundations of York in 1793, four miles east of the French stockade.\n\nA first-hand account of the fort describes it. \"The fort of Toronto was at the end of the bay, on the side which is quite elevated and covered by flat rock, so that vessels cannot approach within cannon shot. This fort or post was a square about 180 feet on a side externally with flanks of fifteen feet. The curtains formed the buildings of the fort. It was very well built, piece upon piece, but was only useful for trade. A league west of the fort is the mouth of the Toronto river, which is of considerable size. The river communicates with Lake Huron by a portage of 15 leagues, and is frequented by the Indians, who come from the north.\" \n\nIt was a small, palisaded fort with a bastion at each of its four corners. The fort consisted of five buildings: a \"corps de garde\", storeroom, barracks, blacksmithy, and a building for the officers. A drawing purported to date from 1749 shows the fort adjacent to Lake Ontario. Today the location is a hundred metres or so from the lake's current shoreline, which has been infilled.\n\nA wall surrounded the fort with an entrance to the south facing Lake Ontario and a small road (\"chemin\"). Captain Gother Mann showed the layout in his map, \"Plan of the Proposed Toronto Harbour,\" dated December 6, 1788. The map shows five buildings in the stockade as well as the bounds of the quadrangle enclosed by the palisades.\n\nVestiges of the fort remained for many years afterwards. When Toronto secured part of the garrison common for the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, the fort site's mounds were levelled and some depressions filled in. To mark the spot, a large granite boulder was dredged up from the bay, inscribed \"This cairn marks exact spot of Fort Rouile, commonly known as Fort Toronto, an Indian Trading Post and Stockade. Established 1749 AD, by the order of the government of Louis XV in accordance with the recommendations of the Count de la Galissonniere, Administrator of New France 1717–1749. Erected by the Corporation of the City of Toronto, 1878.\" In the summer of 1887, a large obelisk was unveiled to mark the spot where the original French-built Fort Rouillé was erected. The site is now part of Exhibition Place.\n\nThe grounds were excavated in 1979 and 1980 by the Toronto Historical Board, and again in 1982 by the Youth Committee of the Toronto Sesquicentennial Board. The outline of the original fort has been marked out in concrete around the obelisk. Two commemorative plaques – one in English, and one in French – are attached to the base of the obelisk, placed there by the Ontario Heritage Foundation. To the north, a third plaque commemorates the excavation done on the site, and to the west, a fourth plaque commemorates a visit to the site by Bertrand Delanoë, mayor of Paris, on September 6, 2003. A concrete outline of the original fort is marked on the ground.\n\nThe obelisk is flanked by a cannon and a mortar, dating from the 1850s; they are all British. A second cannon, present on the west side of the obelisk as recently as 2005, has since been removed.\n\nThere is a short street, Fort Rouille Street, located approximately north of the fort site accessible from Springhurst Avenue. The street at one time extended south to the fort site.\n\nThe English-language plaque erected by the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1957 at the Fort Rouillé monument reads:\n\n\n"}

Convinced that his dream is a message from God, Cartman corrals Stan, Kyle and Kenny into assembling a band called \"Fingerbang.\" However, Kyle notes that most boy bands have five members (using New Kids on the Block, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync as examples). As a result, they hold auditions for a fifth member. Wendy gets the job despite Cartman's opposition to allowing a girl in a boy band.\n\nCartman tries to convince the manager of the local shopping mall to let them play a free show there, but is turned down. Chef tells him that the key to success for this sort of band is to get some girls screaming, as girls' screams are very contagious. Cartman gets the band to perform for a video, shot inexpertly by Timmy, and pays classmates to scream at them. The mall manager reluctantly agrees despite the catastrophic quality of the video to give them the show.\n\nStan's father Randy inexplicably throws a fit when he discovers what his son is up to and forbids him to take part in the band. He eventually reveals that he was part of a boy band called \"The Ghetto Avenue Boys\" back in the 1980s. Randy dropped out of high school and left his friends and family behind to pursue this fame. Although initially wildly successful, the band was quickly replaced due to its members' getting \"too old\" to be part of a boy band. Deeply in debt and properly shamed, Randy was forced to sell his possessions and return home with the remainder of his earnings to complete his education.\n\nHowever, after a heart-to-heart father-to-son conversation, Randy agrees to let Stan play, deciding that his son has to make his own mistakes in order to learn. The two rush to the mall for the show, where Cartman is desperately stalling for time while they try to find a replacement for Stan. Stan and Randy arrive in the nick of time but Kenny is crushed to death by an elevator, reducing their numbers once more to four. Randy gallantly steps in to replace Kenny and perform the song. When one of the few remaining listeners asks for an autograph afterwards, the group realises that, what with all this \"fame\" that they have acquired, they will never be able to live normal lives. They promptly break up the band.\n\nThe mall manager is voiced by Marcus Vaughn, a friend of Trey Parker and Matt Stone who appeared in Parker's film \"Orgazmo\" as a \"stunt cock.\" \"Fingerbang\" was going to be the name of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's band. They stated they thought this was a good idea for a short time, and later settled on their pornography-derived name, DVDA. On the DVD episode's commentary, the creators remarked this was the first episode where they really started to use the method of \"straight-storytelling.\" Before this, almost all episodes had A-stories, B-stories, and C-stories, that would all come together in the end. In making this episode, the creators say that they learned that an episode can be about just one subject, with the characters' side stories all relating to the main idea.\n\nThe chief mall cop who uses pepper spray returns in the fifth-season episode \"Cartmanland\" as the security guard Cartman hires to guard his amusement park. Fingerbang briefly returned in the season 23 episode \"Band in China.\"\n\nButter's audition song is \"Little Bunny Foo Foo\" (which has a similar melody to Alouette). Wendy's audition song—\"\"—is an adaptation of the traditional schoolyard rhyme \"Miss Susie.\" Randy's fit of rage, ending in him head-bashing the glass doors of a china cabinet and shouting \"\"No! Nooo!!\"\" parodies a scene in \"\", in which Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, acts in a similar manner. Randy's voice even changes from Parker's to a sampling of Stewart's voice from the film. The band's name, Fingerbang, references the band Badfinger.\n\n"}

Taylor\n\nGeorge Arthur Taylor (February 14, 1899 — December 3, 1969) was an officer of the United States Army. He is most famous for the leadership of his men in World War II on Omaha Beach during the Normandy landings, June 6, 1944, where he served as commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment and for which he earned a Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism.\n\nHe served most of his career during World War II with U.S. 1st Infantry Division, where he was assigned as deputy commander of the division.\n\nGeorge Arthur Taylor was born in the small village Flat Rock, Illinois, in the southeast of Illinois. His family later moved to Pryor Creek, Oklahoma, where he graduated from high school in 1916. He was a graduate of the United States Military Academy, class of 1922, and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant.\n\nDuring 1920s and 1930s Taylor held a variety of infantry assignments, beginning with an infantry unit at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, and followed by posts in Hawaii, Washington, North Dakota, and San Francisco.\n\nIn 1937, he was finally detached to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth for further staff training until the next year. Then he returned to the field duty and was assigned to the Fort William McKinley at the Philippines, where he served with the Philippine Scouts.\n\nAfter returning from the Philippines, Taylor was assigned to the 16th Infantry Regiment, where he was promoted to the Intelligence Officer of the 1st Battalion. In June 1941, he was transferred for a short while to the Caribbean, where he served with US Forces at the Headquarters as assistant chief of staff.\n\nAfter a month of service, he returned to the United States and became Instructor of tactics at the Infantry School in Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nAfter entry of the United States into the war, Taylor was transferred to North Africa, where he served as a staff member of Advanced Echelon Amphibious Forces, Atlantic Fleet, and in October as a staff member to the Naval Operating Base Commander in Oran, Algeria. In February 1943, Taylor briefly led 26th Infantry Regiment and on 20 April of the same year, he was transferred back to the 16th Infantry Regiment, where he replaced Colonel d'Alary Fechet as regimental commander.\n\nHe then commanded the Regiment during the Allied invasion of Sicily and Omaha Beach.\n\nHe arrived on the beach in a later wave, about 0800. A colonel at the time, he was still the regimental commander for the 16th Infantry Regiment, which took many casualties in the initial assault. He found the remnants of his exhausted and shell-shocked men pinned down along the seawall. He was able to motivate, organize and lead the attack inland.\n\nHis famous quote from Omaha Beach:\n\nTaylor is sometimes confused with General Norman Cota, who was also on the beach that day, but in a different sector with a different unit, the U.S. 29th Infantry Division. Both officers rallied the troops under fire. In the film \"The Longest Day\" General Cota (played by Robert Mitchum) was given Taylor's line.\n\nFor this action, George Taylor was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The official U.S. Army citation for Taylor's Distinguished Service Cross reads:\n\nTaylor was promoted to Brigadier General on 1 August 1944 and became the assistant commander of the 1st Division from Oct 1944 to July 1945.\n\nDuring the final days of the War, U.S. 1st Infantry Division reached the area of western Bohemia, near the city of Karlovy Vary. German XII Army Corps under command of general of artillery Herbert Osterkamp was located in this area and surrendered to the Western Allies. Command of U.S. 1st Division accepted the German surrender and arranged a meeting in the nearby town of Loket. The representatives of the U.S. forces present were Brig. General Taylor, Col. Harrold and Maj. Wich. On the German side, it was general Osterkamp and some other staff officers.\n\nWhen General Taylor checked the surrender document, he noted that the place of surrender was written as the city \"Elbogen, Sudetenland\". Taylor struck out the location \"Elbogen, Sudetenland,\" adding a note \"does not exist,\" and wrote \"Loket, Czechoslovakia\" instead, changing its name back to before the Nazi invasion. This act brought him great respect in Czechoslovakia.\n\nGeneral Taylor stayed with 1st Division in Europe during the rest of the year 1945 and finally retired in 1946 with the rank of Brigadier General on health grounds. Brigadier General George Taylor died on 3 December 1969 in the city of Palo Alto, California, after prolonged illness caused by a stroke.\n\nDirector Samuel Fuller served under Taylor during the war and mentioned his name in several of his films.\n\n"}

The specific neighborhood that it is supposed to represent is disagreed upon. Art director Victor DiNapoli has stated that it is supposed to be located on the Upper West Side. \"Sesame Street's\" founder, Joan Ganz Cooney, stated in 1994 that she originally wanted to call the show \"123 Avenue B\", after the Alphabet City area of the Lower East Side and East Village.\n\nThe opposite side of Sesame Street is not part of the set, though there are some rare occasions of seeing the other side from another location. The opposite side of Sesame Street would often be seen in the \"Sesame Street\" movies.\n\nSesame Street primarily revolves around a brownstone-type row house called 123 Sesame Street. The house is a three-story building with a daylight basement, totaling three known apartments.\n\n\nThe building was meant to appear typical of New York neighborhood brownstones, being described as a \"survivor of gentrification\" by art director Victor DiNapoli.\n\nOscar the Grouch's Trash Can sits in front of a fence made of salvaged doors and is where Oscar the Grouch lives. Oscar the Grouch's Trash Can is deeper than anyone suspects. In the first episode, Gordon mentioned that the Trash Can had three and a half bedrooms. The seemingly bottomless domain houses a variety of diverse Grouch amenities and luxuries. Oscar's girlfriend Grundgetta is his most recurring visitor to his Trash Can. In \"Sesame Street Visits the Firehouse\", Gordon mentioned that in Oscar's Trash Can lived, \"Two elephants, a puppy, a rhino, a goat, and a worm.\" The only time when the interior of Oscar's Trash Can was explored as a setting was in the 1999 film \"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland\", when Elmo impatiently enters the Trash Can in search of his blanket. In Season 46, as part of the set redesign, the Trash Can was moved to the other end of the front of 123 Sesame Street, along with a recycling center and a compost bin.\n\nBehind the doors is where Big Bird's Nest is which is where Big Bird lives. One of the windows of Gordon and Susan's apartment overlooks the nest. Big Bird's Nest was later redesigned following a hurricane that hit Sesame Street. Big Bird's best friend Mr. Snuffleupagus is the most frequent visitor to his nest.\n\nTo the left of 123 is a forecourt that serves as the entrance to a carriage house. The forecourt called the Arbor serves as a playground, and separates 123 from a tenement. The set continues to the left of the Arbor as the street turns to the left. In the first season, the Arbor was a tiny location between the two buildings, as there was no curve in the street. In the late 1990s, the characters decided that the neighborhood needed more green space and built a garden in a vacant lot behind the Arbor. The garden behind the Arbor is where Stinky the Stinkweed resides.\n\nAt one time, the building that serves as its backdrop housed a garage. For a while, it was the location of Gina's veterinary practice, and later Charlie's Auto Repair garage. During the Season 46 set redesign, it was converted to a community center with Abby Cadabby's fairy garden behind it.\n\nHooper's Store is located immediately after this bend in the road. It is a lunch counter and general store.\n\nHooper's Store was first run by Mr. Hooper when it was opened in 1951. David worked at the store from 1971-1983 and became the proprietor of Hooper's Store following the death of Mr. Hooper (which was the result of the death of Will Lee). David ran Hooper's Store from 1983-1989.\n\nFrom 1989-1998, Hooper's Store was run by a retired firefighter named Mr. Handford.\n\nSince 1998, Hooper's Store is run by Alan.\n\nOther employees at Hooper's Store included the following:\n\n\nThe Sesame Street Library is a common point of interest on Sesame Street. It was originally located next to Hooper's Store in the spot that has since housed the Fix-It Shop, the Mail-It Shop, and the Laundromat. All the residents of Sesame Street would come to borrow books. Maria worked there as a part-time job when she was still in school while Grover would often come and help out at the library. Linda worked as a full-time librarian as well. The library was removed from the main set in early seasons, although it made an appearance at the far end of the street in a 2007 episode.\n\nThe Fix-It Shop is where Maria and Luis work. The residents of Sesame Street would bring their broken items to the Fix-It Shop to have them repaired.\n\nIn 2002, the location where the Fix-It Shop was ended up converted to the Mail-It Shop where it was still operated by Maria and Luis. Residents of Sesame Street would use the Mail-It Shop to send and receive letters and packages. Grover occasionally did delivery work for the Mail-It Shop. The location was converted back to the Fix-It Shop in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the Laundromat is the current location next to Hooper's Store after the Fix-It Shop was moved to another location and near the Subway Station. This is where the residents of Sesame Street do their laundry. The Laundromat is run by Leela and later Nina.\n\nIn \"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland\", the Laundromat was seen across from 123 Sesame Street before it was moved to being next to Hooper's Store.\n\nSesame Street has its own Subway Station, which is a replica of the 72nd Street Subway entrance. It was originally seen on the \"Around the Corner\" part of Sesame Street until it was transferred to the main Sesame Street set.\n\nIn Season 45, a Bicycle Shop appears in that vacant lot near the Subway Station that was briefly used for a flower shop. It is run by Luis who sells bicycles and also repairs them. As part of the rare views of the other side of Sesame Street, the Bicycle Shop is next to a CGI depiction of Manhattan where it shows a playground and the Triborough Bridge among the cityscape.\n\nOther locations on Sesame Street include the following:\n\n\nAround the Corner was considered an expansion for Sesame Street in the 1990s from Season 25 to Season 29.\n\nAccording to Sonia Manzano, she quoted that \"By expanding the street and going around the corner, we will have other places to hang out beyond the stoop of 123 Sesame Street, and we will be able to explore family issues which we think are so important to kids today.\"\n\nThe Around the Corner parts were dropped by Season 29 (though it did appear in \"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland\"). Caroll Spinney and Martin P. Robinson commented that the kids would have a hard time keeping up with the characters.\n\nAmong the known locations of Around the Corner include:\n\n"}

It is located below the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. This station is served by the B Line.\n\nThe central station of the three subway stops in Hollywood, it is within walking distance of many important landmarks including the Capitol Records Building. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is also upstairs, while the Pantages Theatre is across the street. Other attractions include CBS Columbia Square, the Frolic Room, Gower Gulch, the Sunset and Vine apartment complex, and the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nIn accordance with Metro's initiatives to spur transit-oriented development around its stations, Hollywood/Vine has become a prime target for regeneration. The W Hotel opened a 300-room location in a mixed-use site with condominiums and of street retail space. In addition, the 1600 Vine complex to the south contains 375 apartments and of street-level retail.\n\nHollywood/Vine opened on June 12, 1999, as the western terminus of the northern branch of the Red Line. Upon the opening of the westward extension to North Hollywood in 2000, it lost its title as the end of the line.\n\nLike most stations on the Metro, Hollywood/Vine uses an island platform setup with two tracks. There is an entrance to the east of the intersection at Argyle Avenue.\n\nEach B Line station was assigned a professional artist to design the aesthetic appeal and personality of the station. Local Los Angeles Chicano artist Gilbert Luján (aka Magu) was selected to design this station. \"Light\" was one of the central themes of the station because of its pervasiveness in Hollywood, from stars to light that passes through projectors to show films to the sun in sunny southern California. Cultural motifs in the form of So Cal cultural icons are also prevalent throughout the myriad of ceramic tiles lining the walls of the corridors as passengers descend into the railway tunnel. Benches for waiting passengers were fashioned as classic car lowriders on pedestals.\n\nThe station has, perhaps, the most detail and decorations of any station in the entire Metro system. This station is among the most pleasant and \"fun\" stations and tourists may find this station the most enjoyable. Other features include two movie projectors donated by Paramount Pictures pointed towards a representation of a movie screen flanked by large curtains. The ceiling of the station is covered with empty film reels. Pillars that provide support for the station are designed to look like palm trees, and beneath the handrail of the stairs are musical notes for the famed song \"Hooray for Hollywood.\" Passengers making their way to the street follow the \"Yellow Brick Road\" while passing many colored tiles that depict icons or represent southern California lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2103852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103852", "title": "Orthomode transducer", "text": "Orthomode transducer\n\nAn orthomode transducer (OMT) is a waveguide component. It is commonly referred to as a \"polarisation duplexer\". Orthomode transducers serve either to combine or to separate two orthogonally polarized microwave signal paths. One of the paths forms the uplink, which is transmitted over the same waveguide as the received signal path, or downlink path. Such a device may be part of a VSAT antenna feed or a terrestrial microwave radio feed; for example, OMTs are often used with a feed horn to isolate orthogonal polarizations of a signal and to transfer transmit and receive signals to different ports.\n\nFor VSAT modems the transmission and reception paths are at 90° to each other, or in other words, the signals are orthogonally polarized with respect to each other. This orthogonal shift between the two signal paths provides approximately an isolation of 40 dB in the K band and K band radio frequency bands.\n\nHence this device serves in an essential role as the junction element of the outdoor unit (ODU) of a VSAT modem. It protects the receiver front-end element (the low-noise block converter, LNB) from burn-out by the power of the output signal generated by the block up converter (BUC). The BUC is also connected to the feed horn through a wave guide port of the OMT junction device.\n\nOrthomode transducers are used in dual-polarized Very small aperture terminals (VSATs), in sparsely populated areas, radar antennas, radiometers, and communications links. They are usually connected to the antenna's down converter or LNB and to the High Power Amplifier (HPA) attached to a transmitting antenna.\n\nWherever there are two polarizations of radio signals \"(Horizontal and Vertical)\", the transmitted and received radio signal to and from the antenna are said to be “orthogonal”. This means that the modulation planes of the two radio signal waves are at 90 degrees angles to each other. The OMT device is used to separate two equal frequency signals, of high and low signal power.\nProtective separation is essential as the transmitter unit would seriously damage the very sensitive low micro-voltage (µV), front-end receiver amplifier unit at the antenna.\n\nThe transmission signal of the up-link, of relatively high power (1, 2,or 5 watts for common VSAT equipment) originating from BUC \"(block up converter)\", and the very low power received signal power (µV) coming from the antenna (aerial) to the LNB receiver unit, in this case are at an angle of 90° relative to each other, are both coupled together at the feed-horn focal-point of the Parabolic antenna. The device that unites both up-link and down-link paths, which are at 90° to each other, is known as an Orthogonal Mode Transducer \"OMT\".\n\nIn the VSAT K band of operation case, a typical \"OMT\" Orthomode Transducer provides a 40 dB isolation between each of the connected radio ports to the feed horn that faces the parabolic dish reflector (40 dB means that only 0.01% of the transmitter's output power is cross-fed into the receiver's wave guide port).\nThe port facing the parabolic reflector of the antenna is a circular polarizing port so that horizontal and vertical polarity coupling of inbound and outbound radio signal is easily achieved.\n\nThe 40 dB isolation provides essential protection to the very sensitive receiver amplifier against burn out from the relatively high-power signal of the transmitter unit. Further isolation may be obtained by means of selective radio frequency filtering to achieve an isolation of 100 dB (100 dB means that only a 10 fraction of the transmitter's output power is cross-fed into the wave guide port of the receiver).\n\nThe second image demonstrates two types of outdoor units, a 1-watt Hughes unit and a composite configuration of a 2-watt BUC/OMT/LNB Andrew, Swedish Microwave units.\n\nThe following images show a Portenseigne & Hirschmann K band configuration, that highlights the horizontal the vertical, and circular polarized wave-guide ports that join to the Feed-horn, the LNB or BUC elements of an outdoor unit.\n\nAn ortho-mode transducer is also a component commonly found on high capacity terrestrial microwave radio links. In this arrangement, two parabolic reflector dishes operate in a point to point microwave radio path (4 GHz to 85 GHz) with four radios, two mounted on each end. On each dish a T-shaped ortho-mode transducer is mounted at the rear of the feed, separating the signal from the feed into two separate radios, one operating in the horizontal polarity, and the other in the vertical polarity. This arrangement is used to increase the aggregate data throughput between two dishes on a point to point microwave path, or for fault-tolerance redundancy. Certain types of outdoor microwave radios have integrated orthomode transducers and operate in both polarities from a single radio unit, performing cross-polarization interference cancellation (XPIC) within the radio unit itself.\nAlternatively, the orthomode transducer may be built into the antenna, and allow connection of separate radios, or separate ports of the same radio, to the antenna.\nAn ortho-mode transducer can be modelled as a 4-port device, 2 of these (H and V) representing the single-polarization ports and the remaining (h, v) embodied by the degenerate modes in the dual-polarized port.\n\nThe scattering parameters can be gathered in a 4×4 scattering matrix formula_1, which is symmetrical for a reciprocal OMT (i.e. not including circulators, isolators or active components), thus leaving 10 independent terms for a general lossy device:\n\nformula_2\n\nOf these:\nAn ideal OMT exhibits perfect matching (null terms on the diagonal), unitary direct transmission terms and infinite XPD and isolation (null corresponding scattering parameters):\n\nformula_13\n\nCharacterization of a manufactured OMT (considered the device under test, DUT) is usually a delicate matter for both mechanical and theoretical reasons.\n\nConceptually, if an ideal OMT is available as part of the measurement setup, often named \"golden sample\", its dual-polarized port can be connected to its counterpart on the DUT, resulting in a 4-port equivalent device with 4 single-polarization ports. The ideal OMT splits the two polarizations at the dual-polarized port into two standard single-polarized ports and such arrangement allows the direct measurement of all the scattering parameters of the DUT (either by using a 4-port vector network analyzer (VNA) or a 2-port one with 2 single-polarized loads used in several combinations).\n\nSuch ideal setup is only prone to mechanical uncertainties related to the physical placement and alignment of the dual-polarized ports. A simple misalignment angle formula_14 introduces an artificial path from each polarization to the opposite proportional to formula_15. The phasorial combination of the leakage formula_10 (or formula_9) due to the XPDs of DUT and this artificial loss formula_15 is the actual external measured quantity. If, by proper phase recombination, the two contributions tend to cancel each other, the actual measured XPD can increase to infinity (possible only if formula_19), thus resulting in a huge estimation error.\n\nDepending on the expected XPD of the DUT, mechanical countermeasures should be introduced to guarantee that the artificial measurement uncertainty can be neglected.\n\nAny deviation from this ideal setup, however, introduces errors and uncertainties.\n\nIf a dual-polarization matched load is available in place of the ideal OMT, this allows 2×2 measurements from the single-polarization ports, yielding only 2 of the reflection terms (formula_3 and formula_3) and one IPI (formula_11). Other measurements aimed at gaining estimations of the other scattering parameters of the DUT involve the dual-polarized port and require additional components, such as dual-polarized to single-polarized transitions or tapers, which are often not matched on at least one of the two polarizations: this creates undesired reflections which propagate through the OMT and combine at the VNA ports thus preventing direct measurements. These issues add to mechanical factors and enhance uncertainties in the measurement procedure.\n\nDue to the increasing demand for high-capacity data links, the exploitation of dual-polarization has fostered research in design and characterization of OMTs to overcome the practical difficulties. The literature concerning OMT modelling and practical characterization consists of works both by academic organizations such as the National Research Council (Italy), Marche Polytechnic University and European Space Agency and likewise by industrial teams such as CommScope and Siae Microelettronica with immediate impact on products for modern dual-polarized telecommunication systems, for instance in terrestrial microwave backhauling.\n\n\n"}

The gang hang out at Jellystone Mall owned by \"Diamond\" Doggie Daddy with Augie Doggie as his heir to the mall business. Yogi and the gang work at an agency called L.A.F. (short for Lost and Found) where they act as detectives trying to solve mysteries under the supervision of the mall's security guard Officer Smith. Dickie Dastardly and his sidekick Muttley would cause trouble for Yogi and his gang. The show also introduced teenage bear named Roxey Bear who was Cindy's rival and Yogi's competitor as well as news reporter Chuck Toupée. The characters were never seen at home or school.\n\nSome of Yogi's other pals like Secret Squirrel, Morocco Mole, Top Cat, Hardy Har Har, Squiddly Diddly and Wally Gator were also featured as young children.\n\nOther Hanna-Barbera characters are still in adult form: Hokey Wolf is the Mayor of Jellystone Town and Ding-A-Ling Wolf briefly appeared as his photographer, Loopy De Loop works at the Jellystone Mall's Picnic Basket Food Court, Atom Ant served as Jellystone Town's superhero, Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey were wild west-themed entertainers, Pixie and Dixie lived in the cheese cottage within a cheese store owned by Mr. Jinks, Lippy the Lion owns a jewelry store, Peter Potamus and So-So ran a plant shop called \"Peter Potamus' Plant Palace,\" Snooper is a crime-solving celebrity while Blabber ran the \"Crooks 'n' Books\" store, and Magilla Gorilla appeared as a teen idol in \"Jellystone Jam\" as Magilla Ice (a takeoff of Vanilla Ice).

{"id": "2103872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103872", "title": "Abdullah Khadr", "text": "Abdullah Khadr\n\nAbdullah Ahmed Khadr (in Arabic عبدالله أحمد خضر) (born April 30, 1981) is a Canadian citizen who is the oldest son of the late Ahmed Khadr, alleged to be a terrorist and al-Qaeda member. Khadr has admitted buying weapons for al-Qaeda, but maintains that he was on friendly terms with its leaders due to his father's prominence in Pakistan and Afghanistan and was not a member.\n\nHe was arrested in Pakistan in 2004 and returned to Canada in December 2005. He fought a lengthy case to prevent extradition to the United States. It was concluded by an appeal to the highest court in Ontario; the judges unanimously decided in October 2011 in favor of the lower court to refuse the extradition request. Khadr was released from custody.\n\nAfter 1985 the Khadr children grew up mostly in Pakistan as their father worked there for charities aiding Afghan refugees. Abdullah and his brothers did some arms training there. His youngest brother, Omar Khadr, was captured by United States forces during a firefight in 2002 at the age of 15 in Afghanistan. In October 2010 he pleaded guilty in a plea agreement to war crimes before the Guantanamo military commission after being held there since 2002. He was repatriated to Canadian custody in September 2012.\n\nAbdullah Khadr has said that he would \"be the first one to stop\" any potential attacks against Canada. In 2010 he became engaged to be married, at the age of 29.\n\nAbdullah Khadr was born in 1981 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as the second child and first son to Ahmed Khadr and his wife Maha el-Samnah, while his father was still in graduate school in computer science. As a child, Abdullah claimed his vision of Jannah (paradise) involved fast cars. He was the oldest of five boys, and had two sisters, one older and one much younger.\n\nWith his family, he moved as a child to Pakistan in 1985, where he largely grew up. The family frequently returned to Canada to see grandparents and other relatives. Abdullah and his siblings went to local schools and were also home-schooled by their mother.\n\nIn 1994, Khadr was sent to Khalden training camp along with his younger brother Abdurahman, where he was given the alias \"Hamza\". Omar Nasiri later claimed to have met Abdullah in the camp's infirmary. Khadr told Nasiri about seeing Afghans in Khost blown apart while trying to salvage an unexploded bomb. Abdullah did not remember the encounter. The two brothers fought constantly at the camp; one day their argument became so heated that they pointed guns at each other, screaming, before a trainer stepped between them. In 1997, a dispute between the brothers was mediated by the older Abu Laith al-Libi, who earned their confidence and respect by telling them about the city of Dubai and imported Ferrari cars. Abdurahman later described him as \"really cool.\"\n\nAs the oldest son, after becoming old enough to drive, Abdullah often drove his father around Pakistan for his work; the older man had been severely injured in an accident in 1992. In 2000, Khadr allegedly had contact with a \"high level member of al-Qaeda\" who took the 19-year-old with him to purchase weapons for fighting against the Northern Alliance militants and supplying an Afghan training camp.\n\nFollowing the American invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, the family split up. Their mother took the youngest children, Omar and a daughter, into the mountains in Waziristan, in order to be further away from potential targets for US bombing.\n\nIn 2002, his sister Zaynab took their younger brother Abdulkareem to Lahore with her while seeking medical aid for her two-year-old daughter Saferai. Abdullah later joined his siblings in Lahore, as he needed surgery on his nose.\n\nA Taliban spokesman said that the January 26, 2004 suicide bomber who killed Cpl. Jamie Murphy in Kabul was \"Mohammed\", the son of a Canadian purportedly named Abdulrahman Khadr. The similar names led analysts to speculate the bomber had been Abdullah; he was the only son of the Khadr family whose whereabouts were then unknown. DNA samples from the remains of the bomber later proved it was not Khadr.\n\nWhen interviewed for the 2004 documentary \"Son of al Qaeda\", shown on PBS in the United States, Khadr acknowledged attending the Khalden training camp as a youth. But he said that a ten-year-old learning to fire an AK-47 was as common in Afghanistan then as it was for a Canadian child to learn to play hockey.\n\nRichard J. Griffin, Assistant Secretary of State (Diplomatic Security) for the United States later called Khadr \"one of the world's most dangerous men.\"\n\nIn their December 2005 indictment, United States officials alleged that in 2003, Ahmed Khadr was asked to organise militants operating near the border of Shagai, Pakistan. He asked his son, 22-year-old Abdullah Khadr, to help him procure weapons, as the younger man had some experience. According to the US indictment, Khadr procured weapons for his father, and became an arms dealer, selling weapons to other militants and earning about $5000 in profit on the transactions. They involved approximately $20,000 worth of mortar rounds, landmines, grenades and 7.62×39mm AK-47 ammunition. After his father Ahmed Khadr was killed on the border by Pakistani security forces in October 2003, Abdullah allegedly continued his trade in weapons.\n\nAccording to the US indictment, Khadr also allegedly aided militant friends by helping them operate a GPS unit in Pakistan. He said they wanted to measure the distance between a local graveyard and a house Khadr believed belonged to Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. The house was that of President Pervez Musharraf. Khadr's friends were later arrested near the graveyard.\n\nKhadr is alleged to have purchased a forged Pakistani passport for 30,000 rupees ($600), and to have given it to his sister Zaynab for safekeeping.\n\nIn October 2004, Khadr was allegedly purchasing five Soviet 9K38 Igla Surface-to-air missiles for $1000 apiece from a 29-year-old Pakistani member of Lakshar e-Taiba. He offered to split the profit upon selling the weapons for $5000 apiece to the same man who had taught him how to acquire munitions in 2000.\n\nIn 2004, an \"American intelligence agency\" classed Khadr as a threat, and offered a $500,000 bounty for his capture. Khadr was arrested by the Pakistani military in Pakistan on October 15, 2004. Four days after his capture, \"agents of the United States\", including an FBI agent, visited the \"quasi-prison\" to interview Khadr. The visits continued for seventeen days.\n\nThe Canadian government learned of Khadr's capture in November 2004. Details of the US bounty on Khadr were initially hidden from the public, under claims it would threaten national security to admit the fact. In 2007 a Canadian memo dated October 19, 2004 describing the bounty was accidentally released. Reporters were warned not to publish the information, and \"The Globe and Mail\" newspaper took the government to court to fight the secrecy order. Justice Richard Mosley ruled that the information could be made public in May 2008, stating, \"the fact that a foreign state paid a bounty for the apprehension of a Canadian citizen abroad and that Canadian officials were aware of it at an early state is also a matter in which the public would have a legitimate interest.\"\n\nSeveral weeks after arresting Khadr, Pakistan officials allegedly offered to repatriate him to Canada, but Canadian officials refused. They suggested that Pakistan look into turning him over to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) instead. In April 2005, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arranged for officers from Project A-O, including Richard Jenkins, to fly to Pakistan to question Khadr for three days. One account suggested this was to prove that they were a \"self-sufficient intelligence agency\".\n\nKhadr said that when he was about 14 years old, his father had purchased two pairs of walkie talkies from Abdullah Almalki. His lawyers later argued that he made the statement due to mistreatment by Pakistani officials. He was also questioned about Amer el-Maati, who he said had worked as a carpet salesman after al-Qaeda had refused to grant him a pension following a brain injury stemming from a 1992 car accident. Asked about Mahmoud Jaballah, Khadr said he knew him only as an Arabic tutor in Peshawar who went by the patronymic \"Abu Ahmed\". Asked about the Toronto Imam Aly Hindy, Khadr said that Hindy's son Ibrahim had briefly attended the \"Musab al-Surri\" Afghan training camp several years prior to 9/11. Hindy has discussed this himself. The RCMP later concluded that it was unlikely they could prosecute Khadr under Canadian law, since any statements made following \"mistreatment\" by Pakistani officials would not be considered valid in Canadian courts.\n\nIn June 2005, Canadian officials believed that negotiations with Pakistan to extradite Khadr had succeeded. They removed Khadr from no-fly lists, hired guards to escort him, and issued Khadr an emergency passport, no. EC016094. They planned for him to fly with escorts to Canada aboard a British Airways flight from Islamabad, scheduled to land in Toronto at 18:00, June 15, 2005. Canadian consular officials were \"mystified\" when Khadr did not appear at the airport. It sent a note to the Foreign Affairs office stating, \"Given subj[ect] is now not returning to Cda, grateful mission wld ask Pakistani authorities what happened, where he is, which authority is holding him, etc. etc, and a new consular visit asap\".\n\nIn July 2005, the FBI agent Gregory T. Hughes and Canadian Diplomatic Security Service agent Galen J. Nace interrogated Khadr for three days, who was still being held in Pakistan. On each day, Khadr waived any Miranda rights and agreed to speak with them. He repeated his earlier confession regarding his alleged training in Khalden, and purchasing munitions for the same \"high level member of al-Qaeda\" he had worked with in 2000.\n\nPakistan refused to transfer Khadr to the United States, insisting he should be returned to Canada. On November 23, 2005, a Boston federal district court accepted prosecutor James B. Farmer's request for a request to extradite Khadr from Canada. Eight days later the Canadian government agreed to accept Khadr from Pakistan. The timing led critics to speculate that Canada was helping the United States get around Pakistan's refusal to transfer Khadr to American forces.\n\nAbdullah Khadr returned to Toronto, Ontario, Canada on December 2, 2005, accompanied by two officials from the Foreign Affairs department. They were met by RCMP officer Konrad Shourie and others, who interviewed him for two and a half hours. Two days later, Khadr agreed to another interview with FBI agents in the presence of Shourie. Court documents confirmed that he and his sister Zaynab Khadr were both under investigation by the RCMP for terrorism-related offences. Commentators expressed confusion about why they had not been charged with criminal offenses under Canadian law. During his sixteen days of freedom in Canada, Khadr was under constant RCMP surveillance.\n\nOn December 17, 2005 Khadr was phoned by the Canadian police and asked to meet them at a nearby McDonald's restaurant in Toronto. When he arrived with family members, Khadr was arrested based on a United States extradition order filed in US district court in Boston. The RCMP insisted the arrest \"had nothing to do with\" Canadian police. His mother was arrested after she hit one of the police officers. His brother Abdurahman Khadr was with them and took photos of the arrest with his camera phone.\n\nThe next day, Prime Minister Paul Martin spoke at length about Abdullah Khadr and other members of his family. He reiterated that there was only one kind of Canadian citizenship, and that Abdullah Khadr, and the other members of his family, were as entitled to all the legal protections as any other citizen.\nKhadr's lawyers tried to have a publication ban bar media from reporting on the bail hearing held for the suspect. Prosecutor Robin Parker opposed this request, citing the open courts principle. Justice Anne Molloy of Ontario's Superior Court of Justice refused to order the publication ban, and ultimately denied bail. He was represented by Nathan Whitling, Dennis Edney and James Silver. In court Khadr wore a black T-shirt reading \"For the Future of Islam.\" His maternal grandmother Fatmah el-Samnah offered to act as his surety, putting up her $300,000 house as collateral. The motion for bail was opposed by the prosecutor Robin Parker, who referred to United States claims that the forged passport Khadr had purchased in Pakistan was to allow him to travel to a country without an extradition treaty with the United States. Judge Molloy found there was an unacceptable risk that Khadr would flee, and also that the public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined were she to grant Khadr bail. A second application for bail, brought by Khadr before Justice Gary Trotter, was also refused.\n\nKhadr was held at Toronto West Detention Centre. On May 22, 2006, Khadr was involved in a brawl with another inmate over telephone privileges there. He appeared in court shortly afterwards, where he was represented by the attorney James Silver. His extradition hearing was set to begin October 30.\n\nOn April 7, 2008, Khadr appeared in a Toronto court to argue against extradition to the United States. He alleged that his confessions in Pakistan were obtained through torture. The government had classified evidence which was not shown to the public, but was shared with both Khadr and his lawyers; the judge Richard Mosley wrote a private summary of the information it contained. Khadr argued that the evidence was what he had said to convince Pakistani interrogators to stop torturing him.\n\nOn October 5, 2009 Khadr testified about his capture and treatment in Pakistan. Colin Freeze, writing in \"The Globe and Mail\" about Khadr's claims of torture, reported: \"Ultimately, the judge will decide how to square Mr. Khadr's alleged admissions with such legal principles as the right to remain silent and the right to counsel, in determining whether any of his statements ought to count at all.\" Isabel Teotonio, writing in the \"Toronto Star\", reported that Khadr testified that he was beaten and \"penetrated\" by a rubber paddle during the fourteen months he spent in Pakistani extrajudicial detention.\n\nFollowing final arguments regarding the USA's request to extradite Khadr on April 7, 8 and 9, 2010, the Ontario Superior Court Justice Christopher Speyer denied the extradition request on August 4, 2010. Abdullah Khadr was set free after 4½ years. Khadr told reporters after his release, \"I think this is going to be a new beginning for me in life.\"\n\nMichelle Shephard, the \"Toronto Star's\" national security expert, reported that Speyer's ruling was 62 pages long. According to Shephard, Speyer criticised the $500,000 bounty offered by the US, and the abuse Khadr suffered in Pakistan. The justice wrote: \"the rule of law must prevail over intelligence objectives.\"\n\nDennis Edney, one of Abdullah's lawyers, said, \"When a U.S. government or any foreign government steps into a Canadian court they have to arrive with clean hands.\"\n\nAccording to his attorney Nathan Whitling, Khadr is engaged to be married.\n\nThe Attorney General of Canada initiated an appeal on behalf of the USA before the Ontario Court of Appeal. On May 6, 2011, the appeals court affirmed the lower court's decision that Khadr should not be extradited. The highest court in Ontario unanimously confirmed in a 3-0 ruling, the original judge's decision to deny the extradition request.\n\nThe Federal government tried to initiate an appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada. On November 3, 2011, the Supreme Court announced they would not review the US request to extradite Khadr.\n"}

{"id": "2103879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103879", "title": "Axelay", "text": "Axelay\n\n\"Axelay\" is a sci-fi scrolling-shooter in the same vein as other Konami titles such as \"Life Force\" (\"Salamander\") and \"Gradius\". The game features both horizontal and vertically scrolling levels and allows the player to choose three different weapon-types, which increase in number as they progress through the game.\n\n\"Axelay\"'s gameplay varies quite a bit from that of traditional 2D scrolling shooters. Instead of the player collecting weapon power-ups from defeated enemies in order to acquire more advanced weapons, the player earns weapons as they advance in the game. There are three weapon types with which the fighter is outfitted at the start of the level: a standard weapon, a special weapon, and a bomb or missile. The player may freely switch between each of these weapon types during a level. At the end of each level, a new choice of one of these types of weapons is added to the player's armory, and the player is given the ability to modify their fighter to suit the needs of the next level. Examples of weapons include multiple-way shot, vulkan cannon, and spread bombs. Similar to Konami's own \"Life Force\", levels transition between vertical and horizontal scrolling layouts, forcing the player to select weapons that will be most effective for each level.\n\nThese weapons also operate like shields. The game eschews the standard one-hit-kill model prevalent in space shooters, instead simply disabling the currently selected weapon and reducing the player to a weak default version of that weapon type. Sustaining a second hit while using a weakened weapon will destroy the player's ship. However, directly colliding into an enemy will still destroy the ship instantly.\n\nThe game uses various visual effects in both the top-down and side-scrolling stages. In the top-down stages, enemies and objects are warped as they come into view to produce a pseudo-3D effect. The game also uses parallax scrolling effects.\n\n\"Axelay\" takes place in the fictional planetary system known as Illis. Once a peaceful system, it was invaded by an alien empire known as the Armada of Annihilation, taking over the planets of the Illis system, including the Earthlike Corliss (known in the Japanese version as \"Mother\"). As a last resort against the alien forces, the D117B Axelay fighter is sent out to recover its lost weaponry and put a stop to the invasion.\n\nHaving traversed the cloud covered Cumuluses, the space colony Tralieb, the largely populated Urbanite, the watery Cavern, and Sector 3 Lava Planet, Axelay makes its way to the Armada of Annihilation's Fortress and completes its mission.\n\nThe game was programmed by Hideo Ueda. Kazuhiko Ishida, credited with \"support program\" on \"Axelay\", later left Konami to help found Treasure Co. Ltd. \n\n\"Axelay\" was composed by Taro Kudo, credited as \"Taro.\" The music for the second stage (\"Colony\") was remixed by Masanori Adachi, credited as \"M.C. Ada\".\n\nAfter beating the game three times consecutively, a message appears promising Axelay 2. However, \"Axelay 2\" never materialized.\n\nThe game was released on September 11, 1992 in Japan for the Super Famicom home console. \"Axelay\" was originally intended to be a Japanese exclusive, but was given a U.S. release in response to numerous letters from consumers and critics. Later in that month it was released in North America, and the following year in Europe.\n\nThe game was re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console service in Australia and North America in 2007 and in Japan in 2008.\n\nThe soundtrack was released on a single 22-song disc on October 21, 1992, published by King Records. The track \"Unkai\" was included on the \"Konami All Stars 1993\" compilation and the track \"Colony\" was included on the \"Perfect Selection Konami Shooting Battle II\" disc.\n\nThe game's visual effects combined with what was then seen as an advanced selection of weapons available, as well as the music score, made \"Axelay\" into a popular shooter for the SNES console.\n\n\"GamePro\" praised the game's inventive weapons, range of challenge for players of differing abilities, and the fact that the player starts the game already with three fully charged weapons. They gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for control and fun factor and a perfect 5.0 for graphics and sound. \"Nintendo Power\" scored \"Axelay\" 3.75 out of 5, praising its graphics but noting that its head-on perspective takes some getting used to. \"Super Play\" gave the game an 85%.\n\n\"Axelay\" is considered by some publications as a classic of its genre. \"Super Play\" listed it number 36 on its list of the top 100 SNES games of all time in 1996. The following year, it was listed as number 91 on \"Electronic Gaming Monthly's\" 100 best games of all time in their 100th issue, which cited its Mode 7 effects, the boss visuals, and the strategy involved in choosing the weapons loadout before each level. The website ScrewAttack called it the #6 best 2D shooter. \"Nintendo Power\" magazine later called it the #18 best game on the SNES.\n\nRetrospective reviewers praised the game as well. Both IGN and GameSpot gave the Virtual Console re-release of \"Axelay\" a 7.5 out of 10. \"Nintendo Life\" gave the game a score of 80 out of 100.\n\nThe Axelay fighter makes an appearance in the Konami title \"Airforce Delta Strike\" as an unlockable aircraft.\n\n"}
{"id": "2103880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103880", "title": "Mankuthimmana Kagga", "text": "Mankuthimmana Kagga\n\nMankuthimmana Kagga, written by Dr. D. V. Gundappa and published in 1943, is one of the best known of the major literary works in Kannada. It is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Kannada literature and is referred to as the Bhagavad Gita in Kannada. The title of the work can be translated as \"Dull Thimma's Rigmarole\". Kagga is a collection of 945 poems, each being four lines in length. Some of these poems are written in old Kannada. Kagga poems are profound as well as poetic. Most of them can be sung. Though the author calls it an 'a foggy fools farrago', it is a book giving expression to a noble personality's rich experiences. The poet politely that if the word Mankuthimma is crude and below standard it can be substituted by either Venka or Kanka or Shankararya as they please.\n\nKagga explores deeper questions of life, contemplates on the meaning of the Ultimate Truth (reality) and advises us to lead a balanced life in this complex and ever-changing world. Thus, Kagga advises us to follow the middle path while extending one hand towards the Ultimate Truth and the other hand to the phenomenal world. The message of many of the verses from Kagga is \"samatwa\".\n\nKagga is very popular in Kannada literature, and most native Kannada speakers are familiar with at least a few of the poems from this important work. The following are but a few of the poems that are quite well known to people familiar with Kannada literature:\n\nKannada Version:\n\nMeaning:\n\nOne of the popular poems from this work, \"Hullagu bettadadi\", translated below, conveys the spirit of Kagga.\nbe a (gentle) blade of grass at the foot of the mountain; and jasmine flower at home\nBe (strong) like a rock when fate pours (torrential) rains of difficulties on you\nBe sweet like sugar and jaggery to the poor and weak\nBe one with all, Mankuthimma.\nThis short and beautiful poem holds the key for leading a balanced life. It advises us to be humble and gentle yet strong. The song says, be humble like a blade of grass at the foot of the mountain and spread your fragrance like a gentle jasmine flower. The metaphor of gentle blade of grass at the foot of the mountain is very profound. When the rain pours over the mountains, when the mighty winds blow, the tall trees on the mountains may fall down, but the gentle blade of grass will bend and survive. The tall trees are \"too proud\" to bend and surrender to the winds, whereas the humble blade of grass will bend and surrender to the mighty wind. Thus this song imparts to us one of the secrets of life, which lies in learning how to survive by understanding the humbleness of the gentle blade of grass. This poem says, do not always stand firm like a proud, tall tree, but bend like a gentle blade of grass when the winds blow. But, when fate brings its share of difficulties, be ready to face them like a rock. Become a solid rock and face all the difficulties in life. Be gentle and send your fragrance in all directions like the jasmine flower, but also learn to face the difficulties like a rock. Be strong, yet be compassionate to the poor, weak and down-trodden. Do all you can to help the poor and the needy. In the last line, this poem tells us to lead a harmonious life by becoming one with all people.\n\nAlternatively, (Hullagu Bettadali) It also means live a life similar to that of grass on the foot of hill, which serves as food for grazing cattle. Lead a life that is useful to others and self. (manege mallige) Lead a life that is liked by all similar to jasmine flower whose fragrance is liked by all. (Kallagu Kashtagala male vidhi suriye) Psychologically be bold, strong and firm like stone when obstacles in life are encountered. (Bella, sakkare deena durbalarige) Be kind, generous, tolerant and considerate towards weaker and needy people. (Ellarolu ondagu) Finally, just become one with all, lead a flexible life with others.\n\nIn these four short lines, this poem teaches us the secret of leading a balanced and harmonious life, emphasizing gentleness, humbleness, compassion on the one hand and strength on the other hand. The poem explains in simple poetic images one of the messages of the Bhagavad Gita: samatwam, or balance in life (SAMATWAM YOGA UCCHATE).\n\nThere is also Marula Muniyana Kagga which is considered as the practical extension of Mankuthimmana Kagga\n\nManku Thimmana Kagga explores the complexity of life, the various aspects of life - in a simple set of striking words.\n\nAn instance (roughly translated to English):\n\nLife is a Horse driven cart, Fate its driver\nYou are the horse, Passengers - as allotted by God\nSometimes rides to a wedding, sometimes to the graveyard\nOn stumbling, there is always the earth - says Manku Thimma\n\nKannada version:\n\nಬದುಕು ಜಟಕಾಬಂಡಿ, ವಿಧಿ ಅದರ ಸಾಹೇಬ, \nಕುದುರೆ ನೀನ್,ಅವನು ಪೇಳ್ದಂತೆ ಪಯಣಿಗರು.\nಮದುವೆಗೋ ಮಸಣಕೋ ಹೋಗೆಂದಕಡೆಗೋಡು,\nಪದಕುಸಿಯೆ ನೆಲವಿಹುದು ಮಂಕುತಿಮ್ಮ\n\"Baduku jatakaa bandi, Vidhi adara saaheba. \nKudure neen, Avanu peldante payanigaru.\nMaduvego masanako, Hogendakadegodu.\nPadakusiye nelavihudu Mankutimma\"\nAnother excerpt (Translation) :\n\nKannada version:\n\nಹುಲ್ಲಾಗು ಬೆಟ್ಟದಡಿ, ಮನೆಗೆ ಮಲ್ಲಿಗೆಯಾಗು, \nಕಲ್ಲಾಗು ಕಷ್ಟಗಳ ಮಳೆಯ ವಿಧಿ ಸುರಿಯೆ. \nಬೆಲ್ಲ-ಸಕ್ಕರೆಯಾಗು ದೀನದುರ್ಬಲರಿಂಗೆ. \nಎಲ್ಲರೊಳಗೊಂದಾಗು ಮಂಕುತಿಮ್ಮ.\n\n\"Hullagu bettadadi, manege malligeyaagu,\" \n\"kallagu, kashtagala maleya vidhi suriye,\"\n\"Bella-sakkareyaagu deenadurbalaringe,\"\n\"Ellarolagondagu Mankutimma\"\nGauravisu jeevanava Gauravisu chetanava\nAaradoo jagavendu bedavenisadiru\nHoruvude jeevan samruddigosuga ninage\nDaari aatmounnatige – Mankuthimma\n\nValue the life, Respect the soul.\nThis universe is yours and everyone’s\nUniverse is not meant only for your uplift\nBut the journey strengthens your soul.\n\nThis is another gem on how to lead life.\n\nಜಗದೀ ಜಗತ್ತ್ವವನು, ಮಯಾವಿಚಿತ್ರವನು।\nಒಗೆದಾಚೆ ಬಿಸುಡೆಲ್ಲ ಕರಣವೇದ್ಯವನು ॥\nಮಿಗುವುದೇಂ ? ರೂಪಾಖ್ಯೆಯೊಂದುಮಿಲ್ಲದ ವಸ್ತು।\nಹೊಗಿಸಾ ಕಡೆಗೆ ಮತಿಯ -- ಮಂಕುತಿಮ್ಮ \n\nDiscard the essence of the world from the world; discard all material objects;\nabandon all happenings around you - all things listened to, or seen, or felt by touch (senses). \nWhat then remains is a formless substance.\nTurn your mind towards that formlessness - Mankutimma\n\nSome other kaggas\n\nBy Prof. H S Lakshminarayana Bhatta\n\nThis book, also titled \"Gundopanishad\", is an analytical study of the 945 verses of Kagga. Its unique feature is that the author has revived the context-based divisions of the verses as adopted in the very early editions of the \"Mankutimmana Kagga\", adding a distinctiveness to the divisions through his vast experience and deep-rooted study of the work. The book is internally classified into four chapters, titled \"Antharanga (Inner world)\", \"Jeevanadhi (River of Life)\", \"Chaithanya (Spirit)\" and \"Neethisutragalu (Moral rules)\". A distinctive feature of the division is that the classification is based on the commonness of the message delivered in the verses. It not only provides a short and relevant commentary of the verses but also provides meanings for the difficult words used in the verses and suggests the best way of splitting the compound phrases. In the end, the author provides an insight into DVG's other works which convey many valuable thoughts that are worth remembering and applying in life. The author also lists short phrases from the verses, termed as \"Thimma Guruvina Sutragalu\", which by themselves convey the various vagaries and nuances of life and the best way to deal with them and lead a contented life.\n\nBy D.R. Venkataraman\n\nWritten by a disciple of Dr. DVG, this is a great book for studying and understanding the deeper meaning of Kagga.\n\nBy A.

{"id": "2103882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103882", "title": "FIBArk", "text": "FIBArk\n\nFIBArk stands for \"First in Boating the Arkansas\"—it's a three-day festival held in Salida, Colorado that started in the 1950s. The history actually began in 1949 when two friends bet each other who'd win a race from Salida to Cañon City on the Arkansas River. Since that race almost killed both contestants, the race was shortened in subsequent years to about 26 miles of whitewater from Salida to Cotopaxi. It became a community-wide festival.\nToday the festival draws over 10,000 people yearly, around the 3rd week of June, and includes a variety of events on the river and in town. The event has grown from a single boating race to now include biking, running, and other races. The portion of the river where the majority of the races are held runs through downtown Salida, keeping the event close to all of the other activities and festivities offered downtown during the festival.\n\nFrom modest beginnings with only 23 competitors, this festival has grown to showcase more than a hundred competitors each year and now includes live music, foot and bike races, and a parade.\n\nIt is unknown whether the origin of the first kayak race was created by a group of young Salida businessmen over coffee or if it was a dare for bragging rights between boaters. Early interest in the race was carried by word of mouth, and later was promoted by the Salida Chamber of Commerce to promote tourism as the event gained fame. It was one of the first white water events in the U.S. and helped popularize whitewater sports there, compared to the well-developed whitewater competition in Europe.\n\nThe original race was held on June 19, 1949, and was a 57-mile course from Salida to Canon City on the headwaters of the Arkansas River. The race crosses through Bighorn Sheep Canon and the Royal Gorge Canon. The first race had twenty three entrants in six boats, and only two experienced Swiss boaters finished the race.\n\nThe following year the race was shortened to forty five miles, by cutting out the Royal Gorge Canon portion, instead ending in Parkdale, Colorado. Ten boaters entered the race and only one finished.\n\nThe downriver race was shortened to the length it is today, 25.7 miles on the third year of the races since its creation. The course spanned from Salida to the nearby town of Cotopaxi. Eleven boats entered the race, and ten finished.\n\nIn the 1970s, rafting was added to the event list. This included the raft rodeo, raft sprint, and downriver raft races.\n\nFreestyle kayaking was added in 1995. Changes over time to the kayaks made them lighter and more maneuverable, and now allowed acrobatics. Points are earned by the kayaker standing the kayak on its end, flips, and spins. This event gained national ranking in 1998, which allowed competitors to qualify for national championship events.\n\nThere were no regulations on the boats in the early years of FIBArk, and boats were made from a variety of materials. Some crafts were made from catamarans, airplane belly-tanks, pontoon boats, and covered kayaks, among a variety of other materials. The covered kayaks won because of their easy maneuverability on the swift rapids.\n\nThis \"anything goes\" attitude toward crafts paved the way for the modern Hooligan Race, held on the Saturday night of the festival. This race’s criteria are that nothing traditionally boat related, other than paddles, are allowed, and the crafts must be made up of anything but typical boat materials. Crafts that appear in this race are made from a variety of materials, such as inner tubes, wood, life savers, and many more.\n\nToday, world class athletes attend, hailing from France, Germany, Belgium, Scotland, Israel, Italy, England, Switzerland, Austria, Mexico, Canada, and the United States to compete in a variety of boating events, foot races, and bike races.\n\nIn 1953, the first whitewater Slalom races in North America were offered in Salida. This event includes 25-30 gates that the kayaker has to paddle through spanning a half mile course. Points are deducted for missing a gate, hitting a gate, or entering a gate from the wrong direction, which is difficult in whitewater rapids. It’s timed and is to show the kayaker’s skill and maneuverability. Each event has two heats, and the competitors’ best score is picked from the two in final scoring.\n\nCompetitors start at the intersection of F Street and 1st Street, and race up the face of \"S\" mountain, touch the door frame of the house at the top, and run back to the place they started. This is the first event and it kicks off the entire festival. It starts on the Friday afternoon of FIBArk weekend.\n\nFIBArk features many events such as boating, music, attractions for children, and a small amount of shopping. Some bands from Salida's area perform on a local amphitheater. There are many boat races, including the Hooligan race, which is a race where people make boats out of anything they can find, and race them down the Arkansas. Some of them sink, some of them float, but everyone agrees that it's fun. The children's attractions feature inflatable slides and obstacle courses as well as one or two motorized rides. Some vendors in the area set up small stalls to sell their wares in the park that borders the Arkansas.\n\n"}

He is best known for the 2000 single \"Whoa!\", which reached the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nRoss grew up in Harlem and began rapping between the age of 11 and 12. He was inspired by the artists he listened to regularly, including Spoonie Gee, Doug E. Fresh, and Slick Rick. When he was 22, he joined his first rap group, the Schizophrenics, though they did not release any albums. He initially rapped under the alias \"Bacardi Rob\".\n\nHe began associating with the Bad Boy label as early as 1996, appearing on the Bad Boy remix to 112's \"Come See Me\". He was then featured on several Bad Boy releases, including remixes to Total's \"What About Us\" (1997) and Faith Evans's \"Love Like This\" (1998), the song \"24 Hrs. to Live\" (1997) from Mase, and albums by Puff Daddy & the Bad Boy Family (1997) and The Notorious B.I.G. (1999). He also made two appearances on Cru's 1997 album \"Da Dirty 30\", as well as albums by Ol Dirty Bastard, Channel Live, The Madd Rapper, Benzino, Tony Touch, and others. These guest appearances earned him media buzz.\n\nIn early 2000, he released the hit single \"Whoa!\". Produced by Diggin' in the Crates Crew member Buckwild, \"Whoa!\" became his biggest hit. The song peaked at number 43 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and reached the top 10 on both the R&B/Hip-Hop and Rap charts. To date, it remains Rob's only solo single to have reached the Hot 100. His album \"Life Story\" was released in 1999 and rose above platinum sales. Despite subsequently appearing on releases by P. Diddy and G. Dep, he did not make another hit single. His second album, \"The Black Rob Report\" failed to perform as strongly as his debut and quickly fell off the \"Billboard\" 100 charts. In his earlier years, Black Rob headed the street rap team which he named \"Alumni\". In 2005, Jemal Mosley from Off The Block Entertainment started managing Black Rob's career. In 2010, he parted from Bad Boy and signed to independent label Duck Down Records.

He was released from prison in May 2010, and was interviewed by BET two hours later.\n\nSometime in late 2014/early 2015, Ross suffered a mild stroke, likely due to high blood pressure. He has since recovered, and in April 2015, said he was feeling better after adopting a healthier lifestyle, in which he gave up drinking and began eating better. \"I had to change my health regimen and how I eat. That's it. I'm exercising and trying to keep it up,\" said Rob. \"I don't drink no more.\" He is the father of two children, Million and Diamond.\n\n"}
{"id": "2103888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103888", "title": "Federal tribunals in the United States", "text": "Federal tribunals in the United States\n\nFederal tribunals in the United States are those tribunals established by the federal government of the United States for the purpose of resolving disputes involving or arising under federal laws, including questions about the constitutionality of such laws. Such tribunals include both Article III tribunals (federal courts) as well as adjudicative entities which are classified as Article I or Article IV tribunals. Some of the latter entities are also formally denominated as courts, but they do not enjoy certain protections afforded to Article III courts. These tribunals are described in reference to the article of the United States Constitution from which the tribunal's authority stems. The use of the term \"tribunal\" in this context as a blanket term to encompass both courts and other adjudicative entities comes from section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, which expressly grants Congress the power to constitute tribunals inferior to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nArticle III courts (also called Article III tribunals) are the U.S. Supreme Court and the inferior courts of the United States established by the Congress, which currently are the 13 United States courts of appeals, the 91 United States district courts (including the districts of D.C. and Puerto Rico, but excluding three other territorial district courts), and the U.S. Court of International Trade. They constitute the judicial branch of the federal government (which is defined by Article III of the Constitution). \n\nPursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II, all members of Article III tribunals are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. These courts are protected against undue influence by the other branches of government. Judges may not have their salaries reduced during their tenure in office, and their appointment is for life—barring removal from office \"on impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". \n\nUnder the Constitution, Congress can vest these courts with jurisdiction to hear cases involving the Constitution or federal law and certain cases involving disputes between citizens of different states or countries. Among the matters susceptible of judicial determination, but not requiring it, are: claims against the United States, the disposal of public lands and related claims, questions concerning membership in Indian tribes, and questions arising out of the administration of customs laws and the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nArticle I tribunals include Article I courts (also called legislative courts) set up by Congress to review agency decisions, military courts-martial appeal courts, ancillary courts with judges appointed by Article III appeals court judges, or administrative agencies and administrative law judges (ALJs). Article I judges do not enjoy the same protections as their Article III counterparts. For example, these judges do not enjoy life tenure, and Congress may reduce their salaries.\n\nThe existence of Article I tribunals has long been controversial, and their power challenged numerous times. The Supreme Court has consistently affirmed their Constitutionality, and has delineated their power on several occasions. In \"Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.\" () the Supreme Court ruled that some legal matters, specifically those involving \"public rights\", are inherently judicial, and thus Article I tribunal decisions are susceptible to review by an Article III court. Later, in \"Ex parte Bakelite Corp.\" (), the Court declared that Article I courts \"may be created as special tribunals to examine and determine various matters, arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it\".\n\nArticle IV tribunals are the United States territorial courts, established in territories of the United States by the United States Congress, pursuant to its power under Article Four of the United States Constitution, the Territorial Clause. Many United States territorial courts are defunct because the territories under their jurisdictions have become states or have been retroceded.\n\nAn example of a territorial court is the High Court of American Samoa, a court established pursuant to the Constitution of American Samoa. As an unincorporated territory, the Ratification Act of 1929 vested all civil, judicial and military powers in the President, who in turn delegated authority to the Secretary of the Interior in , who in turn promulgated the Constitution of American Samoa, which authorizes the court. As such, the Secretary retains ultimate authority over the courts.\n\nOther United States territorial courts still in existence are:\n\nBefore 1966, the United States District Court in Puerto Rico was an Article IV court. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed , , which transformed the Article IV federal district court in Puerto Rico into an Article III court. This Act of Congress was not enacted pursuant to Article IV of the Constitution, the Territorial Clause, but rather under Article III. This marks the first and only occasion in United States history in which Congress has established an Article III court in a territory other than the District of Columbia. From then on, judges appointed to serve on the Puerto Rico federal district court have been Article III judges appointed under the Constitution of the United States. Like their mainland counterparts, they are entitled to life tenure and salary protection.\n\nThis important change in the federal judicial structure of the island was implemented not as a request of the Commonwealth government, but rather at the repeated request of the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n\nThe District Court of Puerto Rico is part of the First Circuit, which sits in Boston.\n\nThe concept of a legislative court was first defined by Chief Justice John Marshall in the case of \"American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton\", 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 511 (1828), which is sometimes referred to as \"Canter\", after a claimant in the case. In this case, a court in what was then the Territory of Florida had made a ruling on the disposition of some bales of cotton that had been recovered from a sunken ship. This clearly fell into the realm of admiralty law, which is part of the federal judicial power according to Article III of the Constitution. Yet the judges of the Florida Territorial Court had four-year terms, not the lifetime appointments required by Article III of the Constitution. Marshall's solution was to declare that territorial courts were established under Article I of the constitution. As such, they could not exercise the federal judicial power, and therefore the law that placed admiralty cases in their jurisdiction was unconstitutional.\n\nTenure that is guaranteed by the Constitution is a badge of a judge of an Article III court. The argument that mere statutory tenure is sufficient for judges of Article III courts was authoritatively answered in \"Ex parte Bakelite Corp.\":\n\n[T]he argument is fallacious. It mistakenly assumes that whether a court is of one class or the other depends on the intention of Congress, whereas the true test lies in the power under which the court was created and in the jurisdiction conferred. Nor has there been any settled practice on the part of Congress which gives special significance to the absence or presence of a provision respecting the tenure of judges. This may be illustrated by two citations. The same Congress that created the Court of Customs Appeals made provision for five additional circuit judges and declared that they should [370 U.S. 530, 597] hold their offices during good behavior; and yet the status of the judges was the same as it would have been had that declaration been omitted. In creating courts for some of the Territories Congress failed to include a provision fixing the tenure of the judges; but the courts became legislative courts just as if such a provision had been included.\n\nIn \"Glidden Co. v. Zdanok\", the court made the following statement regarding courts in unincorporated territories:\n\nUpon like considerations, Article III has been viewed as inapplicable to courts created in unincorporated territories outside the mainland, \"Downes v. Bidwell\", 182 U.S. 244, 266-267; \"Balzac v. Porto Rico\", 258 U.S. 298, 312-313; cf. \"Dorr v. United States\", 195 U.S. 138, 145, 149, and to the consular courts established by concessions from foreign countries, \"In re Ross\", 140 U.S. 453, 464-465, 480. \n\nEver since \"Canter\", the federal courts have been wrestling with the division between legislative and judicial courts. The Supreme Court most thoroughly delineated the permissible scope of Article I tribunals in \"Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.\", 458 U.S. 50 (1982), striking down the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 that created the original U.S. bankruptcy courts. The Court noted in that opinion that the framers of the Constitution had developed a scheme of separation of powers which clearly required that the judiciary be kept independent of the other two branches via the mechanism of lifetime appointments. This decision was subsequently revisited and affirmed in \"Stern v. Marshall\", 564 U.S. 462 (2011). However, the Court noted three situations (based on historical understanding) in which Congress could give judicial power to non-Article III courts:\n\n\nThe Court also found that Congress has the power under Article I to create \"adjunct tribunals\", so long as the \"essential attributes of judicial power\" stay in Article III courts. This power derives from two sources. First, when Congress \"creates\" rights, it can require those asserting such rights to go through an Article I tribunal. Second, Congress can create non-Article III tribunals to help Article III courts deal with their workload, but only if the Article I tribunals are under the control of the Article III courts. The bankruptcy courts, as well as the tribunals of magistrate judges who decide some issues in the district courts, fall within this category of \"adjunct\" tribunals. All actions heard in an Article I tribunal are subject to \"de novo\" review in the supervising Article III court, which retains the exclusive power to make and enforce final judgments.\n\nPursuant to Congress' authority under Article IV, §3, of the Constitution to \"make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States\"; Congress may create territorial courts and vest them with subject-matter jurisdiction over causes arising under both federal law and local law. But \"the Supreme Court long ago determined that in the 'unincorporated' territories, such as American Samoa, the guarantees of the Constitution apply only insofar as its 'fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights' express 'principles which are the basis of all free government which cannot be with impunity transcended'.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court noted in \"Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor\", 478 U.S. 833 (1986), that parties to litigation may voluntarily waive their right to an Article III tribunal and thereby submit themselves to a binding judgment from an Article I tribunal. However, the Supreme Court later noted in \"Stern v. Marshall\", 564 U.S. ___ (2011), that a party's right to an Article III tribunal is not always voluntarily waiveable in an Article I tribunal for suits at common law. Similarly, in \"Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg\", 492 U.S. 33 (1989), the Court noted that a litigant's right to jury trial under the Seventh Amendment is also not generally waivable in an Article I tribunal for suits at common law. The Supreme Court further noted in \"Granfinanciera\" and \"Stern\" the parallel analysis of rights under Article III and the Seventh Amendment.\n\nArticle IV judges, in that capacity, cannot sit on the United States Courts of Appeals or decide an appeal as part of such panels.\n\n\n"}

After his military service in 1955–1956, he studied for four years at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Originally from Flanders, he worked most of his life in France, and moved later to Santander, Spain.\n\nWilliam Vance started drawing for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"Tintin\" in 1962. After drawing complete real-life stories of four pages for a few years, he started work on his first series, \"Howard Flynn\", written by Yves Duval. Three albums followed, before he created other short-lived series such as the Western \"Ringo\" and \"Roderik\". His first success followed with the series about secret agent \"Bruno Brazil\", written by \"Tintin\"s editor-in-chief Greg, as one of the comics that started the revival and repositioning of \"Tintin\" as a more adult-oriented magazine.\nFrom 1967 on, he continued the stories of \"Bob Morane\" in \"Femmes d'aujourd'hui\", a magazine aimed at adult women. This science fiction series, based on the novels by Henri Vernes, was started by Dino Attanasio and continued by Gerald Forton before Vance took over and made it a success. Between 1969 and 1979, 18 albums with his artwork were published. A few years later, the series moved to \"Tintin\" as well, and Vance was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Felicisimo Coria.\n\nVance meanwhile started two new series, \"Ramiro\", with stories set in medieval Spain, and from 1976 onwards, \"Bruce J. Hawker\", his personal favourite, starring a lieutenant in the Royal Navy.\n\nHis final breakthrough and largest commercial success came in 1984, when writer Jean Van Hamme proposed a new series, \"XIII\". First serialised in \"Spirou\" magazine, this series of contemporary adventures with action, violence, and complicated intrigues, let Vance draw upon his talent for realistic drawings, action scenes and exotic settings. By 2007, he had drawn 18 albums in the series, which sold more than 14 million copies in more than 20 countries, and was twice adapted into a TV series. The series was coloured by his wife Petra Coria, with whom he lived in Santander, Spain.\n\nIn 2010, Vance announced his retirement due to Parkinson's disease. He died of the disease on 14 May 2018.\n\nVance worked in a highly detailed realistic style which has been described as \"precise and nervous\", an \"inimitable\" style resembling no other author. An article in \"Der Tagesspiegel\" discussing his series \"Bruno Brazil\" called his early work already \"meticulous\" and \"sophisticated\", but describes how in the early 1970s it drifted away from the more typical realistic style common in Belgian comics at the time, and became influenced by Dutch comics artist Hans G. Kresse. He also started experimenting with the page layout, with large central panels, and with the colouring, which showed influences of psychedelic art.\n\n\nThese are the comic albums drawn by William Vance published until 2007. Between 2001 and 2011 most of his older work was republished in \"Tout Vance\" by Le Lombard and by Dargaud.\n\n"}
{"id": "2103898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103898", "title": "Baluan Island", "text": "Baluan Island\n\nBaluan Island (formerly known as Saint Patrick Island) is the southernmost island of the Admiralty Islands group which makes up the majority of Manus Province in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Pam Islands, an island subgroup to the south of Lou Island. It is formed from an extinct volcano, also named Baluan.\n\nBaluan is formed by a Pleistocene stratovolcano with a large summit crater and several flank vents, some of which might be from the Holocene age. Baluan has erupted basaltic rock rather than rhyolitic rocks like its neighbours. Several small islands consisting of cone remnants are located within of the north coast. Geothermal activity is observed in coastal areas. Volcanic activity is evident from the hot water springs which emerge close to the shore which are mostly covered by the tide. There is a reef which surrounds the island and prevents the sea from damaging the coast.\n\nThe Saboma Crater is the highest point on the island, at above sea level. It forms the crater rim of the inactive volcano in the middle of the island. It has a maximum width of about . The sides of the crater are densely forested. On the east and south sides of the island there are a number of beaches.\n\nBatapona Mountain, which has an elevation of , is located at the north edge of the island, and is formed of an arcuate rim and pyroclastic cone.\n\nThere is an unconfirmed report of an eruption near the island in 1931 from a submarine vent. Contrastingly, the nearby St. Andrew Strait volcano, off the shore of neighbouring Lou Island, is confirmed to have erupted from 1953 to 1957, which created nearby Tuluman Island.\n\nThere are several settlements on Baluan, including Mouk, Lipan, Sone, and Parioi, which according to the 2011 National Census have a combined population of 1,910. The island is situated within the Local-Level Government region of Balopa (Baluan, Lou, Pam Islands). A significant portion of Baluan's population live away from the island to work in urban areas.\n\nThe languages of Titan and Baluan-Pam, known as locally as Paluai, are spoken on the island, in addition to Tok Pisin.\nIn the early 20th century, the entire population was converted to Christianity, the two main denominations being Catholicism and the Seventh-day Adventists. Tok Pisin is normally used for Church services. Christianity does however operate parallel to other traditional belief systems, which mainly relate to illness and cure. Many Balauan people are members of the Baluan Native Christian United Church, founded in 1946 by Paliau Maloat. The creation of this denomination was in response to oppression under colonial administration from Australia.\n\nThe Balopa Cultural Festival takes place on Baluan, which is the largest cultural event on the island and involves the neighbouring islands Lou and the Pam Islands as well.\n\nOn New Year's Day every year, a set of bright lights appear in the night sky. The colours of these lights are said to be indicative of how good the following year will be. In a bad year, where the lights are red and white for example, there may be more sickness and more of the elderly may pass away. This phenomenon has occurred since at least the mid 20th century, and does not currently have a scientific explanation.\nOne of the main settlements on the island is Mouk, situated on the northern end of the island, which had a population of 341 in the 2011 National Census. The people of Mouk are fishers and seafarers traditionally who speak Titan, and were invited to the island in the late 1940s, moving from the small nearby island of the same name. Prior to that, they had originated from Pere on the southern coast of Manus Island. It is speculated that they were invited to the island in order to protect against other groups which speak Titan, located on the southern coast of Manus Island and in the M'Buke Islands, as they were known for their raids on distant islands.\n\nIn pre-colonial times, villages acted as political units, consisting of multiple groups with common ancestors. Houses of high status and their leader, were called \"lapan.\" Disputes between groups could either be resolved through warfare, or through the preparation of a large feast, which would take several years to prepare.\n\nMost settlements are on the coast. Houses are built elevated from the ground, sometimes with a veranda. A separate building is generally used for cooking. Garden plots are generally not placed next to houses. Family lineages each possess their own land for creating gardens, however this information can be difficult to find.\n\nBlack basalt rocks found in the island's soil have been used to build stone walls throughout the island, which surround gardens and former house sites.\n\nAs a third of Baluan's population does not live on the island, remittances are an important source of income for those living on the island. This practice has raised the living standards in Baluan significantly over time. Most people on the island live a subsistence-based lifestyle, however there are markets on the island for purchasing store goods. A wider selection of store goods can be found at stores in Lorengau. While there are cocoa and coconut plantations on the island, they do not always export, as the cost of petrol to transport produce to the mainland creates additional expense.\n\nPrimary education was established on the island in 1951. There are three elementary schools and one primary school located in Lipan. From grade three onwards, all teaching takes place in English. For continuing to secondary school, students have to leave Baluan for Lorengau or go elsewhere. Education is highly valued in Baluan society, because of the Western knowledge it provides, and the employment opportunities outside of Baluan which come with it.\n\nThe main foods on the island are fish and vegetables grown on the volcanic soil. Strewn with black basalt rocks, the soil is more fertile than what is found on most of the islands in the archipelago. Baluan is surrounded by coral reefs, which provides fish, crustaceans, and sea turtles which can be hunted for their meat. The environmental conditions on Baluan in pre-colonial times did and continue to allow for a subsistence-based lifestyle. In large gardens, people grow taro, yams, pawpaw, banana, sweet potato, pineapple, sugarcane, and corn. Breadfruit, mango and coconuts can be obtained from trees which grow throughout island. The eggs of a bird known as the white fowl are also dug out for consumption. The island has no fresh water, therefore drinking water must be obtained by catching rain water.\n\nA prominent figure from Baluan was Sir Paliau Maloat OBE (1907 – 1991), who was elected as the First National Member of Assembly for Manus Province in 1964. He is known for creating the Paliau Movement, which advocated for the people of the Admiralty Islands to adopt Western and Christian values, expand economic development, and ensure the emancipation of women in the society, in order to modernise Manusian society. He died in 1991 and is buried on Baluan.\n\nWinnie Kiap CBE was born on Baluan and is the High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea to the United Kingdom, and previously served as Secretary to the National Executive Council of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n"}

He was the designer of the modern outline of the city of Havana, Cuba.\n\nKnown as a modern \"conquistador\" of Tierra del Fuego in southern South America, he was a controversial and influential figure. Popper was one of the perpetrators of the genocide against the native Selk'nam people.\n\nPopper was born in 1857 to a Jewish family in Bucharest, Romania, son of professor Neftali Popper, a prosperous antiques merchant, and his wife Peppi. He studied in Paris, gaining credentials as an engineer.\n\nAfter working in Europe for several years, he took a job working on the infrastructure for the telegraph in Chile. He arrived in Argentina in 1885, where he became attracted by the possibility of gold mining in Tierra del Fuego. In 1886 he received a permit from the Argentine Government to form an exploration company to mine for gold near San Sebastián. On September 7, he led an 18-man expedition that included a chief engineer, a mineralogist, a journalist and a photographer. They found gold dust on the beach of El Páramo, in San Sebastián Bay. The expedition was rigorously and strictly enforced according to military standards with heavily armed men, with Popper in direct command of everything. \n\nDuring the expedition, Popper and his men were allegedly attacked by eighty Selk'nam (Ona) armed with bows. The adventurers responded by firing their Winchester rifles, killing all but two of the Selk'nam. After the fight, Popper \"posed his men in the attitude of troops repelling a charge, took a position himself astride one of the dead Indians, and then had the outfit photographed for subsequent use.\" \n\nPopper succeeded in unearthing large amounts of gold and his \"Compania de Lavaderos de Oro del Sud\" realized enormous capital gains on the Argentine stock exchange. A mint built to manage the gold has been adapted as the Museum at the End of the Earth, officially known as the \"Museo Territorial.\"\n\nIn Patagonia, Popper maintained dominance with his private army. He issued his own coins and stamps to symbolize his power. When the Argentine peso lost its value in the market crash of 1890, his gold coins were regarded as currency.\n\nPopper vigorously fought against his enemies; he punished gold diggers and thieves according to arbitrary law. The most controversial aspect of his life was his participation in the Selk'nam genocide against the native communities on Tierra del Fuego. Sheep farmers and gold miners fought against them; the former because the Selk'nam would hunt sheep in their former territories and the latter because of conflicts over mining areas. Together with other bounty hunters, who were paid to kill the Selk'nam, Popper too sent his armed forces to manhunt them.\n\nPopper also prepared an expedition to enforce the Argentine claim for parts of Antarctica.\n\nAfter his sudden death in Buenos Aires at the age of 35, his empire collapsed. The cause of his death has not been established. Contemporary American journalist John R. Spears says that he was poisoned by \"men whom he had offended in the south.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2103914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103914", "title": "Electron transfer", "text": "Electron transfer\n\nElectron transfer (ET) occurs when an electron relocates from an atom or molecule to another such chemical entity. ET is a mechanistic description of a redox reaction, wherein the oxidation state of reactant and product changes. Electron transfer is ionic bonding.\n\nNumerous biological processes involve ET reactions. These processes include oxygen binding, photosynthesis, respiration, and detoxification. Additionally, the process of energy transfer can be formalized as a two-electron exchange (two concurrent ET events in opposite directions) in case of small distances between the transferring molecules. ET reactions commonly involve transition metal complexes, but there are now many examples of ET in organic chemistry.\n\nThere are several classes of electron transfer, defined by the state of the two redox centers and their connectivity\n\nIn inner-sphere ET, the two redox centers are covalently linked during the ET. This bridge can be permanent, in which case the electron transfer event is termed intramolecular electron transfer. More commonly, however, the covalent linkage is transitory, forming just prior to the ET and then disconnecting following the ET event. In such cases, the electron transfer is termed intermolecular electron transfer. A famous example of an inner sphere ET process that proceeds via a transitory bridged intermediate is the reduction of [CoCl(NH)] by [Cr(HO)]. In this case the chloride ligand is the bridging ligand that covalently connects the redox partners.\n\nIn outer-sphere ET reactions, the participating redox centers are not linked via any bridge during the ET event. Instead, the electron \"hops\" through space from the reducing center to the acceptor. Outer sphere electron transfer can occur between different chemical species or between identical chemical species that differ only in their oxidation state. The later process is termed self-exchange. As an example, self-exchange describes the degenerate reaction between permanganate and its one-electron reduced relative manganate:\n\nIn general, if electron transfer is faster than ligand substitution, the reaction will follow the outer-sphere electron transfer.\n\nOften occurs when one/both reactants are inert or if there is no suitable bridging ligand.\n\nA key concept of Marcus theory is that the rates of such self-exchange reactions are mathematically related to the rates of \"cross reactions\". Cross reactions entail partners that differ by more than their oxidation states. One example (of many thousands) is the reduction of permanganate by iodide to form iodine and, again, manganate.\n\n\nIn heterogeneous electron transfer, an electron moves between a chemical species and a solid-state electrode. Theories addressing heterogeneous electron transfer have applications in electrochemistry and the design of solar cells.\n\nThe first generally accepted theory of ET was developed by Rudolph A. Marcus to address outer-sphere electron transfer and was based on a transition-state theory approach. The Marcus theory of electron transfer was then extended to include inner-sphere electron transfer by Noel Hush and Marcus. The resultant theory, called Marcus-Hush theory, has guided most discussions of electron transfer ever since. Both theories are, however, semiclassical in nature, although they have been extended to fully quantum mechanical treatments by Joshua Jortner, Alexander M. Kuznetsov, and others proceeding from Fermi's Golden Rule and following earlier work in non-radiative transitions. Furthermore, theories have been put forward to take into account the effects of vibronic coupling on electron transfer; in particular, the PKS theory of electron transfer.\n\nBefore 1991, ET in metalloproteins was thought to affect primarily the diffuse, averaged properties of the non-metal atoms forming an insulated barrier between the metals, but Beratan, Betts and Onuchic subsequently showed that the ET rates are governed by the bond structures of the proteins -- that the electrons, in effect, tunnel through the bonds comprising the chain structure of the proteins.\n\n"}

In October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 132 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\n\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" is built around a \"bouncy\" keyboard riff sampled from the 1979 track \"Cola Bottle Baby\" by the funk musician Edwin Birdsong. In 2018, Birdsong said: \"I recorded [Cola Bottle Baby] 30 years ago, and here come some guys from France. I asked them, 'Where did you find the music?' And they said, 'I was going through bins and it popped out.' ... I'm blessed and I continue to be blessed by opening my arms to God every day.\" The track also features vocoded vocals.\n\nIn 2016, Daniel Jeakins wrote for \"HuffPost\": \"For all the gifts electronic deities Daft Punk have bestowed upon pop music, no track feels quite as iconic or ingenious as 'Harder Better Faster Stronger' \"...\" Fifteen years on from its release and it’s hard to think of a dance track that’s as prominent in popular culture or influential to modern electronic music.\"\n\nThe animated music video for \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" was produced by Daft Punk and directed by Kazuhisa Takenouchi, director for Toei Animation, under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto. It features the four characters shown on the single cover in a vast electronic facility. There, they are transformed by various machines to resemble humans.

Established in 1984, it is a deemed to be university, autonomous, fully funded and controlled by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of Education, Government of India.\n\nThe beginning of the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology was with a 1979 proposal by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh to establish a science and technology institute. A report prepared by a team of professors from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad in 1981–82, was submitted to the North Eastern Council (NEC) which approved it, paving the way to the registering of the society for the institute on 11 January 1983. NEC set up a working group headed by Amitabha Bhattacharya of Jadavpur University, which submitted a project report and a work plan on October 1983. The report was approved by the Ministry of Education in December that year, though final approval from the Ministry of Education was on a letter dated 12 September 1985.\n\nThe foundation stone of the institute was set on 4 March 1984 by the President of India, Giani Zail Singh. The institute started operating in 1986 with six base modules. Six diploma modules started in 1988 and by 1990 seven degree modules were added. The institute was funded by NEC until, on April 1994, it came directly under the full funding and control of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). In May 2005 it was granted deemed university status. NERIST gained approval for the postgraduate programme from AICTE and MHRD in 1996, and the latter was implemented by 2006.\n\nThe first Convocation of the institute, marking the Silver Jubilee celebration of the establishment of the institute, was held on 1 April 2009 in the presence of the President of India Pratibha Patil. The Second Convocation was graced by the presence of former President of India Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam held in August 2010. Besides the then Director of NERIST, Dr. Joram Begi, the State Governor of Arunachal Pradesh and president of NERIST Society, J. J. Singh and the Director of IIT Guwahati and Chairperson of NERIST Board of Management, Prof. Gautam Baruah were among the other dignitaries who had attended the occasion. Third Convocation of the institute was held on 12 October 2012 in the presence of Union Minister for Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal\n\nNERIST is located in Nirjuli in the Papum Pare district of Arunachal Pradesh at the foothills of Eastern Himalaya. It is 19 Km from Itanagar, the capital of Arunachal Pradesh, on National Highway 52A between Banderdewa and Itanagar. It is 10 Km from Banderdewa - the border between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, and about 390 Km from Guwahati. The institute lies in the \"Capital-complex\", consisting of (Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nurjuli and Banderdewa) and is accessible by road to the neighbouring cities of Assam.\n\nThe national highway NH52 divides the NERIST campus into two. The institute is fully residential, and is spread over 500 acres of land. There are eight hostel blocks with a capacity of 1500 boarders; six of these house male undergraduate students, one postgraduate male students and research scholars and the other female students. The campus has faculty and staff quarters, Medical Health Unit, guest houses, Kendriya Vidyalaya, KG School, temple, church, namghar and a bank.\n\nThe institute is managed by a Board of Management, comprising representatives of MHRD, the eight beneficiary states of the North Eastern region, AICTE and educationists. The state governor of Arunachal Pradesh is the \"de facto\" head of the highest body, NERIST Society, which consists of education ministers of all North Eastern States. The Board of Management is headed by the director of Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Gautam Baruah. The board appoints a well-known academic, generally from north east India, as director of NERIST.\n\nEach discipline has its own head of department, generally the most senior of the professors. The dean(s) for Student Affairs, Academic, Planning & Development and the Registrar oversee all other major activities.\n\nThe HMC is the house of management of all the hostels headed by the HMC chairperson. In addition to this, the administration is also run by the incharge/chairperson of Training and Placement (T&P) Cell, Education Technology (ET) Cell, Sports, Security, NCC/NSS unit, NERIST Entrance Examinations (NEE), Transport and Telecom.\n\nThe academic programme in Engineering and Technology is three modules, each of two years duration. These three modules — called Certificate, Diploma, and Degree — comprise the undergraduate studies. Each module has an entry point through an entrance examination conducted by NERIST. The first entry is after class X.\n\nEach module provides terminality corresponding to an occupational level and, at the same time, allows entry to the next higher module, leading to a degree in engineering and technology in about six years after class X. In the Applied Science stream, a two-year Base module and four year Degree module are offered. The system allows lateral entry from outside, at the beginning of each module.\n\nThe Certificate and the Diploma levels emphasize the practical aspects of engineering, which help an individual become an entrepreneur or to face the day–to–day problems of industry. The Degree curriculum provides instruction not only in engineering but emphasizes management and entrepreneurship aspects as well.\n\nThe institute offers B. Tech, B.Sc., Diploma, Certificate, Management and Postgraduate programmes under following departments.\n\n\nBesides the departments of core engineering and applied science disciplines, NERIST administers the following centres established within the institute -\n\nBesides, there are some departments that are auxiliary and do provide postgraduate courses viz Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics.\n\nThe institute has a library system which consists of a Central library and 11 departmental libraries supporting the teaching, research and extension programme throughout the academic year. The students, faculties, employees are issued library card for issuing books from the central library. The library is having a mammoth collection of books on every engineering subject and basic sciences. Besides that, the library is having a journal section from where one can issue the latest version of most popular and useful journals. The library is also having a very good collection of novels.\n\nBook Bank: In addition to the library system, the institute is having a book bank facility for the students from where every student get a set of useful text books related to the academic syllabus of that particular semester. The books bank was funded by North East Council (NEC) initially; later NERIST provided the useful funds for upgrading and enhancing the collection of books.\n\nNERIST conducts the NERIST Entrance Exam (NEE) to select students for admission to Certificate, Diploma and Degree programmes. Three examinations, known as NEE-I, NEE-II and NEE-III, are held to take admissions at three levels. The NEE-I, for which eligibility is a pass in Class X, is held towards the end of April every year for admissions to the Base Module. NEE-II is for the lateral entry to the Diploma Module of Engineering and to the Degree Module of Applied Science stream and NEE-III is for the lateral entry to the Degree Module of Engineering. The notifications for NEE-I, II and III are published in most regional and national newspapers. NEEs are conducted in centers in the North Eastern States of India.\n\nOf the seats in each of the modules for direct admission, 80% of seats are reserved for the candidates of the eight states of the North East India (10% each) as states' quota. 7% of seats are filled up from the students of North East on merit. 10% of the seats are filled up by the candidates from rest of the States under the All India (AI) quota. 3% of the seats are reserved for physically handicapped candidates with 40-75% locomotor disability.\n\nAdmission to the postgraduate programmes in technology is based on the performance of candidates in all India-level entrance examination GATE conducted by the IITs on behalf of the MHRD, Government of India. Separate entrance tests are conducted for admission to other postgraduate programmes.\n\nA student or an alumnus of NERIST is known as a \"NERISTian\". The Recreational and Creative Activities Forum (RACAF) organises \"Sonabyss\" - a four-day annual cultural fest around October. \"Synergy\" is the annual athletic meet held in January or February when track and field athletic events are held. Football and cricket are the two most popular sports among the \"NERISTians\".\n\nDuring the three-day annual techno-management event \"Shristi\", institutes are invited from all over north-eastern India. Shristi started as the technical-festival of NERIST in 2005 which has become the techno-management festival after the commencement of Management Studies at the institute. Shristi hosts events to build the interest of the audience in higher studies, including events for school children.\n\nNERIST bears National Cadet Corps (NCC) and National Service Scheme (NSS) units. NCC cadets regularly parade on Indian Independence Day and Republic Day. NSS is a community service programme sponsored by the Indian Government. Groups participating in NSS conduct mass awareness and social welfare programmes.\n"}

It was the former seigneury of the Peyrepertusès (in Occitan Pèirapertusés) which means \"pierced stone.\"\n\nIt is located on a limestone ridge at about an altitude of 800 m, on top of a hill which separates Duilhac from the town of Rouffiac-des-Corbières, towering over scrubland and vineyards. A strategic position which enables one at the same time to see far into the valleys that circle it, to control the mountain passes, or to send communication signals to the château de Quéribus a little further south.\n\nThe view of the castle from Duilhac (to the south) is impressive thanks to the 30 to 40 meter cliff on which the Castle is perched. The main entrance is located on the north side, but in the time of the Cathars, a secret passage through a narrow path behind a rocky overhang allowed entrance by means of a detachable ladder. Today, the secret passage's postern is closed off, but the path is still there.\n\nThe castle is one of the \"Five Sons of Carcassonne\" along with the castles Quéribus, Puilaurens, Termes, and Aguilar, all situated atop 'unassailable' rocky peaks. It is called 'Celestial Carcassonne' because it is the biggest of the five castles and it is as vast as Carcassonne.\n\nThe site was occupied during Roman times from the beginning of the 1st century B.C., as recent archaeological excavations have shown. The first historical references to the castle appeared in 806. It was then Catalan and was called Perapertusès. It belonged to the Count of Besalú, a small city situated in Catalonia between Figueres and Olot according to a text from 1020.\n\nIt then passed into the earldom of Barcelona in 1111, and then into the viscountcy of Narbonne. From 1180, the Count of Barcelona (Alphonse II, who later became the king of Aragon) secured his independence from vassalage to the king of France. The area became a de facto border.\n\nAt the time of the Albigensian Crusade, it was the fief of Guillaume de Peyrepertuse who, not wanting to submit, was excommunicated in 1224. He did finally submit after the failure of the siege of Carcassonne, and the castle became a French possession in 1240. IN 1242, Saint-Louis decided to reinforce it and add a second part, the Sant Jordi dungeon, located higher up on the ridge. The Sant Jordi dungeon was then constructed in 1250-51 and the Old Dungeon as well as the Sainte-Marie Church were re-purposed. The situation in the region was unclear until the signing of the Treaty of Corbeil in 1258 which liberated Catalonia and Languedoc. It also fixed the border as just south of Peyrepertuse Castle. Like its neighbors, the castles of Puilaurens and Queribus, Peyrepertuse was one of the royal fortresses which was reconstructed at the end of the 13th century to defend the border against the Crown of Aragon and then Spain until the 17th century.\n\nIn 1355, the castle was restored to its defensive state and Henri de Transtamare, pretender to the Castillian throne, routed at Navarette, was authorized by the king of France Charles V to take refuge there. In 1542, Jean de Graves, lord of Sérignan, seized the castle in the name of the Reformation, but was captured and executed.\n\nThe castle was decommissioned as a border point with the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 having lost its strategic importance. Although the citadel was a lot less valuable after the annexation of Roussillon in 1658, a small garrison commanded by a junior officer was maintained until the French Revolution, during which it was abandoned. Sold as a National Property in 1820, its ruins remain today. The first campaign for the preservation of the monument began in 1950.\n\nSince 1908, the site has been listed as a \"monument historique\" by the French Ministry of Culture.\n\nToday, the ruins of Peyrepertuse Castle welcome close to 100,000 visitors per year. They tower 800m above the region's vineyards and the village of Duilhac.\n\nIt is accessed by a road which ends in a car-park just below the cliff. Visitors can then use a path (about a quarter of an hour) to go round the castle to the east and enter by the main entrance on the north side. Although the castle is in ruins, most of the walls are still standing and some rooms are still well preserved (especially the fortified chapel in the Lower Castle).\n\nFor the brave and the hikers, a long hiking trail leaves the village of Duilhac (take the castle route for a few hundred metres before taking a small path to the right which has hairpin bends). It is a variant of the Cathar trail.\n\nDuring storms or high winds, the climb is strongly discouraged and often prohibited to protect the visitors from lightning and dangerous falls in the St. Louis staircase, which connects the former castle to the dungeon, already highly slippery in good weather.\n\nThe limestone cliff is ideal for rock climbing and all (or almost all) of the routes reach the surrounding wall, a great pleasure for rock climbers who finish their ascent under the watchful eyes of tourist onlookers.\n\n\n"}

A strong advocate of the Civil Rights Movement, Robeson believed \"a fraternity must be established in which success and achievement are recognized and those deserving receive the respect, honor and dignity due them.\" In his speech \"The New Idealism\", delivered as a Rutgers College valedictory address, Robeson supported the idea that all – both colored and white people – need to take part in the creation of the new \"American Idealism\"; which led to the development of the American Crusade Against Lynching.\n\nThe ACAL was first introduced at a \"monster rally\" in Madison Square Garden on September 12. The organization however was officially launched at the nation's capital on September 23 (the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation).\n\nThe ACAL was initially denied support and was refused sponsorship by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The NAACP viewed the ACAL as a campaign that was a \"competition\" to its nonviolent movement. The ACAL however, was recognized and supported by W.E.B Du Bois, one of the founders of the NAACP. Du Bois, along with liberal attorney Bartley Crum, joined Robeson in his \"crusade call\" and endorsed the ACAL campaign. In support of the ACAL, Du Bois stated to the NAACP that \"the fight against mob law is the monopoly of no one person, no one organization.\" Along with Du Bois, Ida B. Wells used journalistic approaches to condemn lynchings.\n\nOne of the most prominent leaders of the Anti-Lynching Crusade, Mary Burnett Talbert of Buffalo, New York, worked with an executive committee of 15 members and the support of over 700 state workers to provide awareness of lynchings in The United States. The main objective of this organization was to \"unite a million women [both colored and white] to stop lynchings.\" Under Talbert's representation, the organization performed a \"short, sharp\" campaign. This campaign received attention as it provided a list of casualties totaling 83 American women who had been lynched by mobs – in addition to 3,353 men – within a 30-year period. Under Talbert's representation, the organization wrote a letter which led to a unanimous endorsement by the executive committee of the National Council of Women.\n\nIn September 23, 1946, Robeson and a delegation representing the ACAL met with President Harry Truman to push for an anti-lynching agenda. Robeson demanded that Truman issue a public statement expressing his views on lynching and recommending a set of legislative and educational measures aimed at eradicating mob violence. Truman turned down these requests, claiming that timing and political circumstances made these measures difficult to implement at the moment. Robeson was disappointed by this and found it troubling that the US government was at the time willing to actively engage in the Nuremberg Trials while it turned its head from racial injustices at home. Delegations also met with US Attorney General Tom Clark as well as the Democratic and Republican national committees. The delegation's program included the creation of a federal anti-lynching bill, arrest and punishment for all lynchers, and preventing Ku Klux Klan members from joining Congress.\n\nMany prominent intellectuals were members, including Albert Einstein. Other notable supporters of the organization were Max Yergan, Joseph Curran, Canada Lee, Jack Kroll, Lena Horne, and Oscar Hammerstein II. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had been long concerned about socialist and communist movements for their instigation of social and labor unrest. Having noted communist support for African-American civil rights before World War II, the FBI characterized the \"Crusade\" as a \"communist front.\" Robeson and the ACAP were thus both put under investigation by the FBI. The FBI classified members such as Einstein as communist sympathizers; and developed intelligence files on them.\n"}

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Liversedge lies between Cleckheaton and Heckmondwike. The Kirklees ward is now called Liversedge and Gomersal with a population at the 2011 Census of 19,420.\n\nLiversedge comprises several settlements that are all distinctive. Norristhorpe clings to one side of the Spen Valley, looking over the town of Heckmondwike. Roberttown is on the opposite side of the A62. Millbridge is the geographical centre of Liversedge and, with the neighbouring village of Flush, is the place the mills of the woollen industry stood. Towards Cleckheaton are Hightown, Littletown and Popeley Hill.\n\nLiversedge has a Wakefield postcode (WF15). Some areas have a Wakefield dialling code (01924) while others have a Bradford dialling code (01274).\n\nLiversedge is recorded in the Domesday Book as \"Livresec\", a manor belonging to Radulf, a vassal of Ilbert de Lacy. There are two possible etymologies for the name: from the Old English \"Lēofheres-ecg\" meaning 'a ridge or edge belonging to Lēofhere'; or, alternatively, the first element could have originally been *\"Lēfer-\", related to the Old English word \"lifer\" used in the sense of 'thick clotted water', and the second element \"secg\", 'a bed of reeds or rushes'.\n\nIn the 15th century, the lord of the manor was a member of the Neville family and Liversedge was already involved in woollen manufacture. The trade grew and by the 19th century the town was busy in the manufacture of woollen goods. In 1812 the town was the scene of a Luddite attack on Rawfold's Mill when approximately two hundred armed weavers, croppers and other artisans attempted to destroy cropping frames at a mill operated by William Cartwright. Two Luddites were killed and some were injured by four soldiers and armed workmen defending the mill, with no losses on Cartwright's side. In 2012, Sparrow Park was constructed outside the former town hall at the top of Knowler Hill in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the uprising, which began just up the road from the monument in the still-operational \"Shears\" pub.\n\nLiversedge has a church that was built at the time of the Battle of Waterloo. Healds Hall, formerly the Spenborough Museum, is now a hotel. In the days of Charlotte Brontë it was home to Hammond Roberson whom she transformed into the Reverend Matthewman Helstone in her novel \"Shirley\".\n\nSpen Beck runs through Liversedge.\n\nThere is only one road sign in the whole area directing motorists towards Liversedge: on the A649 Halifax Road from Bailiff Bridge, with no directions from either the Huddersfield or Dewsbury and Batley sides of the settlement.\n\nPolitically, for Kirklees Council, the Leeds/Huddersfield Road acts as a boundary between electoral wards. Roberttown, Hightown and Littletown are within the Liversedge and Gomersal ward, while Norristhorpe and Flush are part of the Heckmondwike ward.\n\nLiversedge F.C. are a football club in the football league pyramid, playing in the Northern Counties East Football League Premier Division for the 2017–18 season. They play at Clayborn, from Cleckheaton town centre.\n\nThere are also many Sunday League football teams in and around Liversedge playing in the Heavy Woollen Sunday League.\n\nLiversedge Cricket Club play at Roberttown Lane near to the New Inn and play in the Central Yorkshire League.\n\nIn the late 19th century, and before the 1895 schism, Harry Varley, and Bob Wood played rugby union for England, and Liversedge FC, who were founded in 1877. When the rugby football schism occurred in 1895, Liversedge F.C. became founder members of the Northern Rugby Football Union (now Rugby Football League). Liversedge F.C. played for seven seasons from the 1895–96 season through to the end of 1901–02 season, they finished 15th of 22 in the initial combined league, and then 11th, 16th, 15th, 16th, and 16th of 16, and finally 14th of 14, in the Yorkshire Senior Competition, after which they withdrew from the Northern Rugby Football Union. Rugby league in the town is now represented by Liversedge ARLFC, who play behind Spenborough Swimming Pool off Bradford Road and currently play in the Third Division of the Pennine Amateur Rugby League pyramid.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2104048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104048", "title": "Cefaclor", "text": "Cefaclor\n\nCefaclor, sold under the trade name Ceclor among others, is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat certain bacterial infections such as pneumonia and infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, and urinary tract. It is also available from other manufacturers as a generic.\nIt was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in 1979.\n\nCefaclor belongs to the family of antibiotics known as the cephalosporins (cefalosporins). The cephalosporins are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are used for the treatment of septicaemia, pneumonia, meningitis, biliary tract infections, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections. The pharmacology of the cephalosporins is similar to that of the penicillins, excretion being principally renal. Cephalosporins penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid poorly unless the meninges are inflamed; cefotaxime is a more suitable cephalosporin than cefaclor for infections of the central nervous system, e.g. meningitis. Cefaclor is active against many bacteria, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.\n\nCefaclor is frequently used against bacteria responsible for causing skin infections, otitis media, urinary tract infections, and others. \nCefaclor has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Gram positive aerobes - Staphylococci (including coagulase-positive, coagulase-negative, and penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A ß-hemolytic streptococci).\n\nThe following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.\nCautions include known sensitivity to beta-lactam antibacterials, such as penicillins (Cefaclor should be avoided if there is a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction); renal impairment (no dose adjustment required, although manufacturer advises caution); pregnancy and breast-feeding (but appropriate to use); false positive urinary glucose (if tested for reducing substances) and false positive Coombs test. Cefaclor has also been reported to cause a serum sickness-like reaction in children.\n\nCefaclor is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity (i.e. allergy) to cephalosporins.\n\nThe principal side effect of the cephalosporins is hypersensitivity. Penicillin-sensitive patients will also be allergic to the cephalosporins, depending on the cephalosporin generation. The previous percentage of 10% cross reactivity rates are often overestimated. Allergic reactions may present as, for example, rashes, pruritus (itching), urticaria, serum sickness-like reactions with rashes, fever and arthralgia, and anaphylaxis. The frequency and severity of serum sickness-like reactions in children has led researchers to question its role in pediatric illness. Other side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, disturbances in liver enzymes, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice), headache, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Rare side effects include eosinophilia and blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia); reversible interstitial nephritis; hyperactivity, nervousness, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, confusion, hypertonia, and dizziness. Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported. In the UK, The Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) has warned that the risk of diarrhea and rarely antibiotic-associated colitis are more likely with higher doses.\n\nCefaclor is passed into the breast milk in small quantities, but is generally accepted to be safe to take during breastfeeding. Cefaclor is not known to be harmful in pregnancy.\n\nCephalosporins possibly enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarins (e.g. Warfarin) - change in patient's clinical condition, particularly associated with liver disease, intercurrent illness, or drug administration, necessitates more frequent testing of INR, and dose adjustment as necessary.\n\nExcretion of cephalosporins is reduced by probenecid (resulting in increased concentrations of drug in the blood plasma).\n\nAbsorption of cefaclor is reduced by antacids. Therefore antacids should not be taken right before or at the same time as cefaclor.\n"}
{"id": "2104052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104052", "title": "The Ice Warriors", "text": "The Ice Warriors\n\nThe Ice Warriors is the partly missing third serial of the fifth season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in six weekly parts from 11 November to 16 December 1967. This serial marked the debut of the Ice Warriors. \n\nIt was the third incomplete \"Doctor Who\" serial to be released with full-length animated reconstructions of its two missing episodes.\n\nIn the distant future at Brittanicus Base, senior control technician Jan Garrett and her staff struggle to control an ioniser they are using to slow the progress of glaciers rolling over Great Britain. Leader Clent is convinced they can avert a new Ice Age, but the group knows they are only a few hours away from being forced to abandon the base. Tensions rise when Penley, a maverick scientist who has defected from the team, is mentioned. The remaining senior scientist, Arden, is on the glacier searching for archaeological finds, where he discovers an armoured man within a block of ice. Arden and his colleagues dig the ice man from the glacier. Two scavengers observe their actions: the anti-technology Storr and Penley, who live in the tundra. When one of Arden’s team is killed in an avalanche, the other two return to base with the ice man. Storr too is injured in the avalanche.\n\nThe TARDIS arrives outside the base. The Second Doctor, Jamie and Victoria go inside, where the Doctor helps with the Ioniser. Arden and Walters reach the base with their discovery, and Arden sets up a device to melt the ice around the man. The Doctor examines the frozen man, and they determine that the \"ice warrior\" is an alien being. An emergency meeting distracts the staff; no one notices that the ice block has melted, with the creature showing signs of life. The creature revives, knocks Jamie unconscious, and takes Victoria hostage.\n\nThe ioniser planning meeting is interrupted when Jamie reports that the creature has taken Victoria. However, only Arden and Jamie can be spared for a search party. The creature identifies itself to Victoria as Varga, an Ice Warrior from the planet Mars, who has been frozen for millennia. He insists that Victoria help him find his ship and crew.\n\nPenley goes to the base to steal medical supplies for Storr. He sees Varga and Victoria and follows them as they leave the Base. They encounter Clent, and Varga injures him badly. Penley tries to revive Clent and is found by the Doctor, who has worked out he is the errant scientist. While the Doctor aids Clent, Penley leaves the base.\n\nMeanwhile, in the glacier, Varga finds four frozen comrades, revives them, and assigns them to create defensive structures and dig their craft out of the ice. Varga is observed by Penley, who is tracking in the snow having used the medicine on his friend Storr. When Penley returns to Storr, he is surprised to find a visitor, Miss Garrett, who implores him to rejoin the crew of the base.\n\nBack at the base, Jamie and Arden are sent into the glacier, ostensibly to find the alien spacecraft rather than Victoria. They discover the Ice Warriors’ cave excavation and report this to base. Minutes later, they are ambushed by the Ice Warriors, who leave them for dead. Penley finds Arden dead, but Jamie is alive. Penley takes him back to his home. Storr decides to speak to the Ice Warriors, convinced they might be allies.\n\nHaving failed to contact Arden, the base personnel assume something bad has happened. Moments later, the video link appears, operated by Victoria, who tells them of the danger of the Ice Warriors. An Ice Warrior is sent to capture Victoria again and use her as bait. The Doctor decides to go to the spaceship and rescue Victoria. Before leaving, he takes a phial of ammonium sulphide, which he deduces will be noxious to the aliens. However, Victoria flees into the icy caves. When the Ice Warrior finds her, he is caught in an avalanche and crushed.\n\nAn examination of the engines of the Martian craft reveals them to be functional but low on fuel. When the Ice Warriors encounter Storr, they ignore his offers of help. Storr is killed but Victoria, whom he brought from the ice caves, is permitted to live.\n\nMeanwhile, Penley has found the Doctor and taken him to Jamie. He determines that Jamie has temporary paralysis and heads to the Martian craft. He offers himself as an envoy, leaving his communicator active so Clent can hear, and is allowed to enter the airlock. With the glacier threatening to crush the spacecraft, the Doctor has Victoria released to him. Before Varga takes the communicator, the Doctor relays the message that Clent needs to use the Ioniser, regardless of consequences. The Doctor is marched to the core of the spacecraft, where he spots an ion propulsion system. Varga decides to attack the base and orders his Warriors to prepare a sonic cannon.\n\nPenley brings Jamie to base on a motorised sled. Clent gives Penley a frosty reception, and they bicker. Clent says he has decided to use the Ioniser. Zondal has been given the task of arming the sonic cannon. The Doctor and Victoria release the chemical solution at Zondal, who collapses, but his hand activates the sonic cannon as he falls.\n\nThe sonic blast triggered by Zondal glances the base, causing minor damage. Varga uses the communicator to call Clent, threatening to fire again unless the humans surrender. Clent knows the base dome cannot survive another sonic blast and suggests a peace meeting between the two sides. The talks fail when a demented technician, Walters, tries to shoot the Martians. Varga dismantles the Ioniser reactor to get the mercury isotopes he needs for his ship. Without the ioniser, the glaciers move forward.\n\nThe Doctor and Victoria adjust the Martian sonic cannon so it will only harm the Ice Warriors. Penley alters the temperature and atmosphere controls in the base so it becomes uncomfortable for the Martians. The Doctor fires the sonic cannon, forcing Varga and his men to retreat from the base. He fuses the sonic cannon before he and Victoria flee the ship. The Doctor works with Penley to recalibrate the Ioniser. The computer calculates a fifty-percent chance that the Ioniser will explode when trained on a spacecraft with an ion engine; Penley tells Clent to work without the advice of the computer. When the computer overloads, Penley takes charge and starts the Ioniser.\n\nThe Martian craft begins to power up but is destroyed by the Ioniser. The ship explodes without starting a chain reaction, which solves the problem of the Ice Warriors and the glacier. The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria depart as green shoots emerge through the melting snow.\n\nDeborah Watling was unable to attend the complete recording of the final episode. Consequently, Victoria is asked (off-screen) to return to the TARDIS halfway through the episode.\n\nUnusually, the word \"episode\" was dropped from each episode number in this serial. All save episodes 2 and 3 of \"The Ice Warriors\" still exist in the BBC Archives. The four existing episodes were all found in BBC Enterprises' Villiers House property, in August 1988. They were only discovered as the company was in the process of moving out of the building.\n\nMichael Attwell later played Bates in \"Attack of the Cybermen\" (1985). Angus Lennie subsequently appeared in \"Terror of the Zygons\" (1975).\n\n Episode is missing\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a favourable review in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), writing, \"A great minimalist tundra landscape, fine performances from Peter Barkworth and Peter Sallis, and the eerie hissing voices of the Ice Warriors themselves, help turn a standard 'don't trust the machines' storyline into something special.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the Ice Warriors' technical achievements and the \"excellent\" guest cast, writing that there was \"very little to fault\". They noted that the story \"fails to give the viewer any real sense of where all the various settings are in relation to one other\", but said that it was \"a minor irritation\". In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" praised Bernard Bresslaw as Varga as well as the regular cast. While he was positive towards the scientific dialogue, he felt that the message about the computer was less effective today, and called the climax \"disappointingly shambolic\". Reviewing the DVD release in 2013, \"SFX\" reviewer Ian Berriman gave the story three out of five stars. He called it a \"success\" despite \"boring/bewildering story elements\", concerning how Clent spends six episodes deliberating and \"flawed\" motives and reasoning behind the Ice Warriors' plan. John Sinnott of DVD Talk said the story was \"a fun, if a little overly long, adventure\" with a \"slow and plodding\" story. Sinnott praised Troughton's performance and found the sets impressive. The animated episodes were not considered to be particularly accomplished: \"There wasn't a huge budget allocated for the project, and it shows unfortunately. The animated characters don't move smoothly, they have a tendency to bob around when walking and are pretty stiff in general. They reminded me of puppets, and move rather like the characters in Thunderbirds.\"\n\nThe programming committee of the public German TV broadcaster ZDF refused unanimously to buy the series after watching \"The Ice Warriors\" for a test. Reasons given included starry-eyed decoration and costumes as well as obscure scripts. Subsequently Doctor Who remained relatively unknown in German-speaking countries.\n\nIn March 1976, Target Books published a novelisation by Brian Hayles of this serial with a cover illustration by Chris Achilleos. In the book, Hayles named the computer system \"ECCO\".\n\nA VHS was released in 1998, which also included \"Doctor Who: The Missing Years\" (see \"Lost in Time\") documentary. It included an audio CD featuring the full-length soundtracks of missing episodes Two and Three which were covered on the VHS by an abridged Tele-snaps/soundtrack reconstruction. A two-disc CD set from BBC Audiobooks features the soundtrack from the television serial, with the addition of narration by Frazer Hines. The recordings include an interview with Frazer Hines, as well as the soundtrack from the BBC's televised trailer for the next serial, \"The Enemy of the World\". An unabridged reading of the Target novelisation was released in 2010 by BBC Audiobooks, again read by Hines.\n\nThe serial was released on DVD on 26 August 2013, with parts 2 and 3 being presented in animated form, with Qurios Entertainment providing the animation. The abridged reconstruction from the 1998 VHS release was also included as part of the Special Features.\n\n"}

(d/b/a Crate & Barrel) is a chain of 122 retail stores in U.S., Canada and 8 other countries, based in Northbrook, Illinois, specializing in housewares, furniture (indoor and out), and home accessories. Its corporate name is Euromarket Designs, Inc. The company is wholly owned by Otto GmbH, based in Germany.\n\nGordon and Carole Segal opened the first Crate & Barrel store on December 7, 1962, at age 23. The space in part of an old elevator factory was located at 1516 North Wells Street in the then-bohemian Old Town neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The inspiration was their honeymoon in the Caribbean, where the Segals saw inexpensive yet tasteful European household products for sale. They became interested in providing functional yet aesthetically pleasing products to young couples just starting out. Surprised to see that European manufacturers offered many beautiful and durable products at reasonable prices, they were inspired to start their own store in the United States. The Segals started by recruiting an employee and leasing an abandoned elevator factory on Chicago's Wells Street. They traveled throughout Europe buying directly from glassblowers, ceramicists and factories making French copper pots and simple white bistro dinnerware.\n\nThe first store opened in response to a flourishing of world trade in home furnishings due to the early 1960s round of talks about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Segals sought out small European companies that were not represented in America and negotiated direct purchases from these factories that could be sold to the consumer while avoiding a wholesaler's markup. To this day, a majority of Crate & Barrel's products are direct imports from Europe, though Thai, Mexican and Indian glass and textiles can also be found in their stores.\n\nThe Segals derived the company name by the materials that they originally used to display items in their Chicago store. A friend suggested they call their company \"Barrel and Crate\", but Carole thought they should reverse the order of the words. They turned over the crates and barrels that the merchandise came in, let the wood excelsior spill out, and stacked up the china and glass. This helped emphasize their strongest selling point, that their products were direct imports.\n\nIn 1966, Segal and the designer Lon Habkirk visited the Design Research store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which had an \"enormous influence\" on their retailing approach. Habkirk later remarked: \"Eventually we took the whole idea and translated it into a reproducible formula.\"\n\nIn 1968, the Segals opened their second store in the Plaza del Lago shopping center in suburban Wilmette, Illinois, and third in Oak Brook, Illinois in 1971.

{"id": "2104078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104078", "title": "Caladium", "text": "Caladium\n\nCaladium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. They are often known by the common name elephant ear (which they share with the closely related genera \"Alocasia\", \"Colocasia\", and \"Xanthosoma\"), heart of Jesus, and angel wings. There are over 1000 named cultivars of \"Caladium bicolor\" from the original South American plant.\n\nThe genus \"Caladium\" includes seven species that are native to South America and Central America, and naturalized in India, parts of Africa, and various tropical islands. They grow in open areas of the forest and on the banks of rivers and go dormant during the dry season. The wild plants grow to 15–35 inches (40–90 cm) tall, with leaves mostly 6-18 inches (15–45 cm) long and broad.\n\nSeveral species are grown as ornamental plants for their large, arrowhead-shaped leaves marked in varying patterns in white, pink, and red (somewhat resembling the unrelated coleus) and have been in cultivation in Europe since the late 18th century. The two forms most widely cultivated are called \"fancy-leaved\" and \"lance-leaved\". The former is the more commonly seen and is the traditional caladium of cultivation; the leaves are more heart-shaped. The latter has more lance-head-shaped leaves. Most Caladiums in cultivation grow to about 24 inches (60 cm) high and 24 inches (60 cm) wide, although dwarf varieties are now in cultivation.\n\nNumerous cultivars have been selected, most of them derived from \"C. bicolor\". Many are sold as \"C. × hortulanem\", a synonym for \"C. bicolor\". The lance-leaved varieties are also derived from \"C. schomburgkii\".\n\nCaladiums grow from tubers and can be propagated by dividing the tubers. They are hardy only to USDA plant hardiness zone 10; in colder areas, they are typically grown as tender \"bulb\"s or as houseplants.\n\nDuring their growing season, they require moderate watering (damp, not soggy). Most varieties prefer partial to full shade, although sun-resistant varieties are now in cultivation. Approximately 98% of all caladium \"bulbs\" are from Lake Placid, Florida, in the United States. In recent years, many new varieties have become available through breeding and are now largely disease resistant. The bulk of \"bulb\" production is sold to pot producers, who in turn provide local nursery outlets with potted caladiums ready for immediate planting. Most \"bulb\" growers also sell direct retail via websites, shipping of \"bulbs\" takes place in the spring when temperatures permit (\"bulbs\" are subject to damage if temperatures are too low).\n\nIn temperate areas, they should be lifted before the first frost. The corms are dried and stored for the winter when temperatures fall to 65 °F (18 °C), and stored moderately dry (not bone-dry) over the winter at temperatures between 56 °F (13 °C) and 61 °F (16 °C).\n\nAll parts of the plant are poisonous. They should not be ingested and may irritate sensitive skin.\n\nAn annual festival is held during the last weekend of July in Lake Placid, Florida, home to a majority of the world's caladium fields. A popular activity is a tour of the fields of caladiums, the product of local growers. Every July since 2003, Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center in Kissimmee, Florida, has presented the Florida Caladium Showcase, the largest indoor and outdoor display of the plants, including new varieties. Many universities feature caladiums at field trials, you may also find displays at arboretums and many public gardens.\n\nCaladiums are tubers, not corms or bulbs. A corm is a compressed mass of stem tissue with a basal plate (root tissue) at the bottom and one or more \"eyes\" on top from which vegetative growth and flowers will appear. A tuber is stem tissue with various eyes which may grow vegetative growth or roots.\n\nMany names have been proposed for species and varieties in the genus, but the vast majority of the names have either been transferred to other genera or regarded as synonyms of other names. The following are accepted:\n\n\n"}

Route 14 is a two-lane highway for its entire length, however, there are plans to widen Route 14 in some spots.\n\nFormerly this road's western terminus was at US 71 in Joplin, and its eastern terminus was at US 67 southwest of Poplar Bluff. These sections are now US 160, Route 174, and Interstate 44 (I-44). The section between Mount Vernon and the southeast corner of Douglas County was Route 40 from 1922 to 1926.\n\nRoute 14 begins at US 60 in northern Marionville. Shortly after beginning it goes into an old alignment of US 60 making a sharp curve at McKinley. It then heads east joining with (for one mile) U.S. Route 60 and Route 413 where it proceeds to pass through Clever and crosses the James River west of Nixa. At Nixa is an intersection with U.S. Route 160 and Route 13. Route 14 then continues east out of Nixa, through heavier traffic, and crosses Business U.S. Route 65. Route 14 now runs through downtown Ozark united with US 65 and heads on a straight course out of Ozark towards Sparta. The road starts to become more hilly west of Sparta.\nRoute 14 then joins with Route 125 for two miles (3 km) where it starts to wind its way east towards Ava. Once Route 14 reaches Ava it meets an intersection with Route 76 and Route 5. Route 14 continues on east for twenty-three miles (37 km) more until it intersects Route 95 twenty-eight miles (45 km) west of U.S. Route 63. Route 14 continues twenty-eight miles where it reaches US 63 and then, for 4.8 miles (7.7 km), forms a concurrency with Route 181 towards the twin bridges east.

She was ordained a bishop in 2003 along with Gisela Forster; reportedly, the ordination was performed by Roman Catholic bishops whose identity remains a secret.\n\nShe has declared as her motive to promote the ordination of women within the Roman Catholic Church which does not recognize the ordination of women as valid: \"A baptized male alone receives sacred ordination validly\". In 1994, Pope John Paul II declared in the apostolic letter \"Ordinatio sacerdotalis\" that \"the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women\".\n\nMayr-Lumetzberger grew up in Linz with religious parents and attended a Roman Catholic school run by the Holy Cross Sisters. Though she and her parents did not always see eye-to-eye, she was very active in her local parish. When she was 14, she was allowed to serve in her local parish as an altar server, though she was not allowed to wear a surplice. Women or girls serving at the Eucharist was against liturgical regulations at the time, but has since become permissible.\n\nAfter leaving school, Mayr-Lumetzberger left to join the convent of the Benedictines of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Steinerkirchen and was given the religious name of \"Marie Christin\". Though she wanted to study theology, after her initial two years in the convent, she was instead sent back to Linz to study to become a religion teacher. During her final year of study, she was working at a school for special needs children where she met a divorcee whom she fell in love with. After completing her studies, she left religious life without dispensation and married him in a non-Catholic ceremony. As such, her marriage is not recognized by the Catholic Church. Because she had abandoned the convent and married a divorced man, she was unable to find subsequent work with the Church.\n\nIn her professional life, Mayr-Lumetzberger eventually got a job training kindergarten teachers and then as a teacher in a special needs school. Though she was in some ways outcast, she continued to be active in her local parish and with volunteer work. It was at this time that she began to perform liturgies and to volunteer as a priest at the local hospital and for those that wanted her services. Gradually, she became bolder and, although she was not an ordained minister, she began to celebrate Mass with friends and perform other priestly functions.\n\nOn 29 June 2002, Mayr-Lumetzberger and six others were ordained priests by Independent Catholic Bishop Rómulo Antonio Braschi, a former Roman Catholic bishop from Argentina who left the Roman Catholic Church out of disagreement with the anti-liberation theology of the Vatican to join the Catholic Apostolic Charismatic Church of Jesus the King. In the media, the ordained women were called the Danube Seven because they were ordained on the Danube River near the town of Passau on the border between Germany and Austria. On 21 December 2002, after refusing to acknowledge the Vatican decree declaring these ordinations void, she and the others incurred excommunication.\n\nIn 2003, Mayr-Lumetzberger was ordained a bishop at a secret ceremony, with the identity of the ordaining bishop remaining a secret. She subsequently ordained several other women as priests, including an ordination of women from the United States and Canada on the St. Lawrence River in 2005 and a female bishop in Indiana. These ordinations are not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. Many Independent Catholic jurisdictions would not consider their ordinations unique as they have been ordaining Catholic women as priests since at least the 1990s.\n\nAt a Sunday Mass on 28 June 2009, Mayr-Lumetzberger was refused communion by Bishop Ludwig Schwarz at the Parish of St. Peter in Linz because of her excommunication. She came dressed as a bishop and was advised by Schwarz not to come to receive communion but she did so, herself taking a host from the ciborium.\n\n"}

He is also working on another crime series with his wife titled \"Control\" that is set to begin publishing in 2014. \n\nAndy Diggle was born and raised in London, England.\n\nDiggle took over editing \"2000 AD\" and \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" in 2000 and, as editor, was credited (most frequently by David Bishop, who originally employed him) as having spearheaded a return to the \"old school\" values of \"2000 AD\". While at \"2000 AD\" he wrote a number of stories, including the Judge Dredd spin-off \"Lenny Zero\" with Jock, with whom he would continue to collaborate after his move to American comic books. In 2001 he won the Eagle Award for \"Favourite Editor.\"\n\nIn 2003 Diggle and Jock created Eagle Award winning and Eisner Award nominated series The Losers which was adapted in 2007 into a movie, directed by Sylvain White.\n\nDiggle spent a total of five years under exclusive contract to DC Comics, for whom he wrote \"Lady Constantine\", \"Batman Confidential\", \"\" (again with Jock), \"\" and \"Hellblazer\".

It had a platform rather than a tubular chassis with a new engine by Tadek Marek. The DB4's design formed the basis for later Aston Martin models, such as the DB4 GT Zagato, the Lagonda Rapide 4-door saloon. \n\nThe lightweight \"superleggera\" (tube-frame) body was designed by Carrozzeria Touring in Milan, and its Continental looks caused a sensation on its unveiling at the 1958 London Motor Show. Although the design and construction techniques were Italian, the DB4 was the first Aston to be built at the company's Newport Pagnell works in Buckinghamshire, England.\n\nThe 3.7 L (3670 cc/223 in³) engine, designed by Tadek Marek a Polish born race driver, has double overhead cam straight-6, with cylinder head and block of cast R.R.50 aluminium alloy, a further development of the earlier engine. The engine was prone to overheating initially, but the 240 hp (179 kW) produced by the twin-SU carburettor version made buyers forgive this unfortunate trait. Servo-assisted disc brakes were fitted all round: early Dunlops were replaced by Girlings. Initially the DB4 fitted 16\" wheels with 600H16 Avon TurboSpeed crossply tyres, or 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 as the radial option. In 1962 they moved onto 15\" wheels with 6.70V15 Avon TurboSpeed with the upgrade option of 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato radials. The independent front suspension used ball-jointed wishbones, coil springs and rack-and-pinion steering. The live rear axle also used coil springs and was located by a Watt's linkage. The normal final-drive ratio for British and European use was 3.54:1: in the United States the ratio was usually 3.77. Customers wanting a car with an especially high top speed could choose a 3.31:1 ratio.\n\nA car with the British standard 3.54 final drive ratio tested by \"The Motor\" magazine in 1960 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 9.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £3967 including taxes.\n\nThere were five \"series\" of DB4. The most visible changes were the addition of window frames in Series II and the adoption of a barred (rather than eggcrate) grille in Series IV. The Series III cars differed from the earlier ones in having taillights consisting of three small lamps mounted on a chrome backing plate. Earlier cars have single-piece units and the last Series V cars of September 1962 have similar taillights but recessed. The Series V also has a taller and longer body to provide more interior space, though the diameter of the wheels was reduced to keep the overall height the same. The front of the Series V usually was of the more aerodynamic style as already used on the Vantage and GT models, a style that was later carried over to the DB5 cars.\n\nA convertible was introduced in October 1961. It featured in-house styling similar to the Touring saloon, and an extremely rare factory hardtop was also available. In total, 70 DB4 convertibles were made from a total DB4 production run of 1,110 cars. 30 of these were Series IV, with the remaining 40 belonging to the Series V. 32 of the total convertibles built (11 and 21 of the different series respectively) were equipped with the more powerful Vantage engine. Top speed for the regular version is about 136 mph.\n\nThe DB4 GT was a special lightweight, high-performance version of the DB4. Introduced in September 1959, it featured enclosed headlights and a thinner aluminium skin for lighter weight. The wheelbase was also reduced in comparison to the standard car, which resulted in many cars not being fitted with rear seats.\n\nThe engine was what made the GT special. Available in 3.7 L (3670 cc/223 in³) and 3.8 L (3750 cc/228 in³) versions, the engine had two sparkplugs per cylinder with two distributors and three twin-choke Weber carburettors. Modifications to the cylinder head brought compression to 9.0:1 and power output was 302 hp (225 kW). Maximum speed for the GT was 151 mph (243 km/h) with a 6.1 second sprint to 60 mph (97 km/h). It was the fastest road legal production car at the time.\n\nSeventy-five GTs were built with this body style. Nineteen more were modified by the Zagato works in Italy into \"DB4 GT Zagatos\", with plain oval grilles, Borrani wire wheels and a smoothed out rear end without the stock GT's tail fins. A single car was styled by Bertone and dubbed the Bertone Jet.\n\nIn 2016 Aston Martin Works announced that a further twenty-five track-only cars based on the 1959 lightweight specification would be manufactured at its Newport Pagnell plant, with delivery expected in late 2017.\n\nWith the introduction of the Series IV in 1961, a high-performance DB4 Vantage was offered. It featured three SU carbs and special cylinder heads, increasing power to 266 hp (198 kW). Most Vantage models used the enclosed headlights of the DB4 GT. In all, there were 136 saloons and 32 convertibles with the Vantage engine.\n\nA tiny number of non-GT DB4s used the GT's more-powerful engine. This combination is often called a Vantage GT, though not all included the Vantage package and none was technically a GT. Three Series III, five Series IV, and six Series V cars have this unusual combination of body and engine for a total of 14.\n\n"}

It is generally used to describe a marriage which was driven solely by the couple, as opposed to arranged marriage. While there is no clear definition of love marriage; the term was in common use globally during the Victorian era. It is used to describe a marriage where the individuals love or court each other and get married with or without consent of their parents.\n\nIn 1761, Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote Julie, or the New Heloise. The title is a reference to Peter Abelard, a 12th-century philosopher, who fell in love with his pupil, Héloïse d'Argenteuil. They had a child and secretly married. When Heloise's guardian found this, he had Abelard castrated. The story was well-known at Rousseau's time, after their letter had been published. Rousseau's book, Julie, is about the titular character and her tutor St. Preux. The book is written in the form of letters. Julie's father opposes the relation and marries her to another man, whom he considers more suitable.\n\nAccording to Coontz, the marriages between Anglo-Saxons were organised to establish peace and trading relationships. In the 11th century, marriages were organised on the basis of securing economics advantages or political ties. The wishes of the couples were not considered important. The bride was especially expected to defer to her father's wishes.\nIn 1140, Decretum Gratiani was written by Gratian. It made consent of the couple a requirement for marriage. This book became the foundation of the policy of the Christian Church on marriage.\n\nThe marriage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert also made love marriage more acceptable in the minds of the British public in the Victoria era where love marriages were on the rise.\n\nAmerican historian Stephanie Coontz has tried to record the history of love marriages in her 2005 book \"Marriage, A History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage\". Her book argues that, while not universal, marriages based on love and personal commitments started to emerge as early as the 14th century and really began to flower in the 1700s.\n\nIn India, love marriages started becoming popular in urban areas in 1970s. Initially, love marriages occurred between acceptable communities. Love marriage now commonly transcend ethnic, community and religion barriers.\n\nIn a 2012 survey conducted by Ipsos for the TV channel NDTV, 74% of the respondents said that they preferred an arranged marriage. In 2010, the National Commission for Women (NCW) released a report stating that it had documented 326 cases of honour killing in the past year, majority of which were due to Inter-caste marriages.\n\nIn a 2014 survey conducted by the United Nations Population Fund and International Center for Research on Women, 11.7% of men and 8.5% of women surveyed claimed that they chose their partners and married with or without the consent of their families. The boundaries between the two types have started to blur. The term \"love-arranged marriage\" is used to describe a new emerging form of marriage which contains elements of both arranged marriage and love marriage. Love marriages are seen as imposition of the younger generation's will over the older generation's wishes.\n\nIn Pakistan, arranged marriages are the norm and love marriage is rare in the society. Several cases of honour killing are recorded every year. In most cases, the woman is killed, however in some cases couples are killed. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan counted about 869 such cases reported in the media, but noted that many such cases may also be unreported.\n\nIn Bangladesh there is a strong code of social and cultural prohibition on inter-gender friendship and/or romantic relationship; there have been so many incidents of unrequited love of boys and in the case of romantic relationship of two individuals, they secretly meet and talk, they may do elopement if their respective guardians are not willing to get them married. Due to society's large portion's Islamic adherence and conservative mentality, inter-gender friendship and romance is heavily suppressed. It is also very difficult to involve in romantic relationship and/or to find a life partner by one's own will and it's generally hard for boys to find life-partners, they need to become earners as Bangladeshi society is very conservative and patriarchal. The society largely relies on the arranged marriage system.\n\nThere has been no honour killing in the history of Bangladesh but there are strong records of guardian objections for various reasons whether the boy is not liked by the girl's parents or the boy is unemployed or of lower-social status etc, in this case the girl is forcibly married to a boy by her parents choice, and if the girl do elopement with the boy, her parents may file a police case against the boy; this social and cultural trend is still too much prevalent in Bangladeshi society. Some couples may commit suicide for not being supported by their families and society.\n\nIn Egypt, love marriages, especially interfaith marriages, are generally considered socially unacceptable. Interfaith marriages are often seen as a tactic to recruit members from other religions. Such marriages sometimes result in sectarian violence.

He was born in Peine, Lower Saxony, Germany to a German Jewish family. He escaped persecution by the Nazis by masquerading as an ethnic German. His life story is told in the 1990 film \"Europa Europa\" loosely based on his autobiography \"Ich war Hitlerjunge Salomon\" (\"I Was Hitler Youth Salomon\"). He made several visits to schools to tell his story.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power, systematic persecution of Germany's Jewish citizens began. In 1935, the Perel family relocated to Łódź, Poland, where Solomon's aunt lived, after their shoe store was deliberately pillaged and Perel was expelled from his school.\n\nAfter the Germans invaded Poland in September, 1939, Solomon Perel and his brother Isaak attempted to escape to the Soviet-occupied part of Poland. Solomon succeeded and was placed in a Komsomol-run orphanage in Grodno, while his brother made his way to Vilnius in Lithuania.\n\nPerel fled from the orphanage after the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, and was captured by a German army unit. Since he was a native German speaker, Perel was able to convince his captors that he was a Volksdeutscher (an ethnic German living outside Germany), and was subsequently accepted into his captors' unit as a Russian–German interpreter. He played a key role in the capture of Joseph Stalin's son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, and thereafter became endeared to his German army unit. The unit's commanding officer even made plans to adopt him, providing him with further protection. As a circumcised Jew, Perel was constantly in danger of being discovered by his military unit, and attempted on several occasions to flee back to the Soviets, each time unsuccessfully.\n\nBeing still a minor, Perel was told he could not remain with the army. Instead, he was sent to a Hitler Youth boarding school in Braunschweig, where he continued to hide his Jewish identity under the name of Josef Perjell (changed to Josef Peters for the film \"Europa Europa\"). At the time he had a girlfriend by the name of Leni Latsch. She was a member of the Nazi-instituted League of German Girls (BDM), so although Perel loved Leni he dared not tell her that he was Jewish, fearing of her informing the authorities. Later, Leni's widowed mother discovered he was Jewish but did not reveal his secret.\n\nOn the night of 20 April 1945, the eve of his 20th birthday and close to the end of the war, Perel was captured by a U.S. Army unit, but released the next day. After traveling back to his birthplace, and making dozens of inquiries, he finally located his brother Isaak, who was married and living in Munich. Perel moved to Munich to be with him. He learned that his father had died of starvation in the Łódź ghetto, his mother was murdered in a gassing truck in 1944, and his sister was shot while on a death march. Likewise he learned that his other brother, David, was alive and in Palestine. Solomon resolved to join him, and in July 1948 sailed for Haifa, in the newly declared state of Israel.\n\nOnce in Israel, Perel joined the army to fight in the Israeli Independence war. After being released from the Israeli army he became a businessman. Perel did not return to Germany until 1985, at the invitation of the Mayor of Peine, to participate in a commemoration of the destruction of the Peine Synagogue.\n\nPerel later wrote a book about his exploits, titled \"Ich war Hitlerjunge Salomon\" (\"I Was Hitler Youth Salomon\"). His work was later adapted into the 1990 film \"Europa Europa\", produced by CCC Film. He often tours and gives talks throughout Europe about his wartime experiences.\n\nThe Dutch playwright Carl Slotboom wrote a play based on Perel's story titled \"Du sollst leben\" (Dutch: \"Je zult leven\"; English: \"Thou Shalt Live\"), which was first aired in Zevenbergen, Netherlands, on 4 May 2012, which is also Remembrance of the Dead in the Netherlands. Salomon Perel visited Zevenbergen to see the play.\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of a three state, 650 mile highway 5. To the north, it continues into Iowa as Iowa Highway 5 and to the south it enters Arkansas as Highway 5. With only a few exceptions, it is two-lane for its entire length. Business Route 5 serves Milan and Ava.\n\nRoute 5 begins at the Arkansas state line in Ozark County as a continuation of Arkansas Highway 5. Approximately to the north of the state line, Route 5 meets U.S. 160 after which it forms a east-west concurrency to the east where it enters Gainesville. After leaving its U.S. 160 concurrency to the north, Route 5 continues northwest for approximately before forming a north-south wrong-way concurrency with Route 95 into Wasola. Route 5 enters Douglas County north of Wasola.\n\nThirteen miles into Douglas County, Route 5 forms a four-mile north-south concurrency with Route 76 past Ava, and serves the town itself with a business route. Within the northwest part of Ava, the concurrent routes intersect Route 14. After Route 76 leaves the concurrency to the east, Route 5 continues for 10 miles before entering Wright County.\n\nShortly after entering Wright County, Route 5 forms a one-mile east-west concurrency with U.S. 60 (as a limited-access highway) in Mansfield. After leaving its U.S. 60 concurrency to the north, the route intersects with Route 38 in Hartville 11 miles later, and then continues for 24 miles into Laclede County.\nIn Laclede County, Route 5 passes through Evergreen, intersects I-44, Route 32 and Route 64 in Lebanon, and enters Camden County 16 miles north of Lebanon.\n\nBetween Lebanon and Camdenton, the road has been realigned and straightened, and several older alignments are visible. Just south of Camdenton, Route 5 forms an 11-mile north-south concurrency with Route 7 which continues through the town and intersects U.S. Route 54. After Route 7 leaves the concurrency to the west, Route 5 leaves the Ozark Mountains and crosses the Lake of the Ozarks at the Hurricane Deck Bridge, passing through Sunrise Beach shortly before entering Morgan County.\n\nTwenty miles north into Morgan County, Route 5 forms a short east-west concurrency with Route 52 in Versailles. After leaving its Route 52 concurrency to the north, it continues north for 14 miles and enters Tipton, in which the route forms a four-mile east-west concurrency with U.S. 50. Soon after leaving its U.S. 50 concurrency to the north, Route 5 enters Cooper County.\n\nIn Cooper County, Route 5 continues north for 20 miles before intersecting I-70 just south of Boonville. Three miles north of I-70, the route enters Boonville and forms a triple concurrency with U.S. 40 and Route 87. All three routes together cross the Missouri River into Howard County.\n\nImmediately after entering Howard County, Route 87 leaves the concurrency to the west, and less than a mile thereafter, U.S. 40 leaves the concurrency to the east. From there, Route 5 continues north to Fayette, in which it forms a nine-mile concurrency with Route 240 that starts with a north-south alignment, but becomes an east-west alignment after intersecting Route 3. Shortly thereafter, Route 240 leaves the concurrency to the south (ultimately heading west), and Route 5 enters Glasgow, after which it returns to a north-south alignment and enters Chariton County.\n\nThirteen miles to the north of the Chariton County line, Route 5 forms a five-mile east-west concurrency with U.S. 24 and enters Keytesville, where it leaves the concurrency to the north and enters Linn County 21 miles later.\n\nAfter entering Linn County, Route 5 immediately passes through Marceline and forms a 12-mile east-west concurrency with U.S. 36 (proposed future Interstate 72) past Brookfield, where they intersect Route 11 together. In Laclede, the route leaves the concurrency to the north at its intersection with Route 139, and passes through Linneus before entering Sullivan County.\n\nIn Sullivan County, Route 5 forms an eight-mile concurrency with Route 6 as they bypass Milan to the south and east. Business Route 5 serves Milan directly, using an older alignment of the route, and ends north of the town where Route 6 leaves the concurrent bypass to the east. From there, Route 5 enters Putnam County 15 miles later.\n\nIn Putnam County, Route 5 forms a brief east-west concurrency with U.S. Route 136 in Unionville. After leaving its U.S. 136 concurrency to the north, the route crosses the Iowa state line and turns into Iowa Highway 5 in Appanoose County.\n\nAs built in the original 1922 road system, the route is largely unchanged from its first path. Most of the paths bypassed are now business routes through cities.\n\nIn the 1950s a section of the route in Wright, Douglas and Ozark counties between Mansfield and Gainesville was straightened and widened. At this time the city of Ava was bypassed and the old route through the center of the town became business Route 5.\n\nBeginning in the summer of 2008, MoDOT began a project to convert Route 5 into a \"shared four-lane\" highway, with continuous passing lanes based on the European 2+1 road model, between Lebanon and Camdenton. A shared four-lane road can be constructed largely within the same footprint as a two-lane road, but allows for alternating passing lanes in each direction. A number of roadways in Europe are built in this way, but Missouri is among the first to do so in the U.S., having first used the method on separate segments of US 63 and Route 37. The project was completed in 2010.\n"}

{"id": "2104142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104142", "title": "Comparison between Esperanto and Interlingua", "text": "Comparison between Esperanto and Interlingua\n\nEsperanto and Interlingua are two planned languages which have taken radically different approaches to the problem of providing an International auxiliary language (IAL).\n\nAlthough they are both classed as IALs, the intellectual bases of Esperanto and Interlingua are quite different. It has been argued that each language is a successful implementation of a particular IAL model. However, in both language communities there is a polemical tradition of using external criteria to critique the perceived opponent language (that is, judging Interlingua by Esperantist criteria and vice versa). In practical use, moreover, language usage in the two communities has sometimes shown convergences despite divergent theory.\n\nOne cannot ascribe a single outlook to all Esperantists or all Interlinguists; however, the contrasting views of L. L. Zamenhof and Alexander Gode remain influential among Esperantists and Interlinguists, respectively. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, was motivated by several strands of nineteenth-century idealism, ranging from Comtean positivism to utopian internationalism. Esperanto, in his view, was a theoretically neutral instrument for communication, which could serve as a vehicle for idealistic values, initially Zamenhof's philosophy of \"homaranismo\", later the \"interna ideo\" (internal idea) of achieving \"fraternity and justice among all people\" (Zamenhof) through the adoption of Esperanto. Among later Esperantists, this philosophy has tended to reinforce a set of propositions about the language:\n\n\nBy the mid-twentieth century, when Gode led the development of Interlingua, the ideals underlying Esperanto had come to seem naive. Influenced by Herder, Gode propounded a Romantic, anti-positivist view of language: languages are an aspect of the culture of a people, not an instrument to achieve a goal; an ideology cannot be attached to a language, except artificially. This implied, in his view, that a world language on the Esperanto model was either impossible or, worse, achievable only through totalitarian coercion. He was of the opinion that, unless imposed by force, a universal global language would presuppose a universal global culture, which does not currently exist and is not necessarily desirable.\n\nOn the other hand, Gode saw another sort of international language—non-universal and non-culturally neutral—as being entirely possible.\n\nEsperanto and Interlingua are fundamentally different in their purposes. Whereas Esperanto is meant to be an international second language able to be fluently learned by speakers of any language, Interlingua is directed more toward European languages, especially its control languages. Though Esperanto may be more neutral as well as easier to master, Esperantists can usually communicate only with other Esperantists, though the language is at least somewhat comprehensible to many who have not studied it; Interlingua, however, is intended to be understood to some extent by a speaker of any Romance language, because many words in Interlingua resemble their originals in Latin, the precursor to all Romance languages.\n\nThe vocabulary of both languages is taken largely from Romance, Germanic and Slavic languages; most of these words are derived from Latin. Depending on their international form, Germanic and Slavic words in Interlingua may be Latinized; for example, English \"blockade\", German \"Blockade\", Russian \"блокада\" → Interlingua \"blocada\". By comparison, all words in Esperanto take on a characteristic Esperanto form. In this case, the Interlingua \"blocada\" and the Esperanto \"blokado\" are nearly identical and equally neutral.\n\nThough both Esperanto and Interlingua borrow primarily from European languages, they also borrow words from other languages which have become widespread. Two different philosophies have led to two different approaches. Interlingua highly regards etymological fidelity, thus it usually adopts the word that is the \"nearest common ancestor\" of the respective words in at least three source language units (considering Spanish and Portuguese together as one unit). Esperanto highly regards regularity, thus it disregards the form of the word in European languages to make it match Esperanto's morphology and phonemic orthography. For example, Interlingua has \"geisha\" (from Japanese 芸者), \"sheik\" (from Arabic شيخ), and \"kayak\" (from Inuit ᖃᔭᖅ); in Esperanto, these words are written \"gejŝo\", \"ŝejko\", and \"kajako\".\nIn Esperanto, to form a new word, it is generally preferred to compound two or more existing roots than to borrow a word from another language. This is recommended in order to keep the number of \"primitive\" roots low and thus to maintain its learnability. Interlingua does not have that as a design aim, thus most of its compound and \"primitive\" (non-compound) words also exist in its source languages.\n\nBoth languages have a highly regular grammar without difficult conjugations or declensions. Some parts of grammar may be considered simpler in Esperanto, while others may be considered simpler in Interlingua. Adjective morphology is simpler in Interlingua because it lacks any declension; noun morphology is also easier since it lacks an accusative form. \n\nInterlingua draws its roots from certain \"control languages\": French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German and Russian. It uses these languages as a means to select the words most used in these major European languages. Esperanto draws from largely the same languages, but uses agglutination more extensively. Rather than using an existing word commonly used among the major European languages, Esperanto forms its own words using its own roots. For example, the Esperanto word for \"hospital\" is mal·san·ul·ej·o, which breaks down into five roots: mal (opposite), san (health), ul (person), ej (place), o (noun). It is notable to mention, however, that there also exist naturalistic forms of many words, in this case \"hospitalo\".\n\nInterlingua tends to use words derived from natural languages instead of extensive agglutination. Despite this, Interlingua features a very concise system for synthesising new words through derivation when it is deemed necessary or practical. Highly agglutinated constructions are greatly frowned upon by Interlinguists, as the regular form of the word (i.e. \"hospital\") is far more understandable to most people.\n\nThe following table illustrates the difference between Esperanto and Interlingua with regards to word formation:\n\nTo the reader who speaks English or a Romance language, the words in the Interlingua column are more likely to appear recognizable. However, speakers of languages that do not have words related to the preferred words in the Interlingua column must preferably learn the Interlingua words one at a time. Esperanto, on the other hand, prefers agglutinating words from various roots, making it possible to derive words only knowing a limited list of roots. The same is theoretically possible in Interlingua, and the addition of one or two affixes to a common word is frequently done colloquially in the Interlingua community. Knowing the 'real' words is however vastly preferred, particularly in elementary cases such as the above. This point underlines the fundamental differences between Esperanto and Interlingua: the latter was designed to be easily \"understood\" by speakers of most Western European languages, whereas the former was designed for people to learn to \"speak\" more easily. Word derivation in Interlingua, however, is more regular than many natural languages.\n\nOften, the European words on which Interlingua is based gain extensive currency in non-Western languages. \"Hospital\", for example, appears in Indo-European languages as well as other major languages such as Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, Papiamento, and Basque. In many other languages, however, the word \"hospital\" is not found, including Finnish, Arabic, Hebrew, Vietnamese and Hungarian.\n\nBoth languages attempt to be as precise as possible; that is, each strives to reflect differences in meaning using different words. The Esperanto compound \"mal-san-ul-ej-o\", literally \"un-healthy-person-place-noun\", implies a place for people who are unhealthy. The word means \"hospital\", but the compound could be construed as any place where an unhealthy person is. Interlingua's non-compound word, though possibly less neutral, thus avoids any misunderstanding. (Depending on the speaker and audience, Esperanto could also use a different word for \"hospital\", such as \"hospitalo\", \"kliniko\", \"lazareto\", \"preventorio\" or \"sanatorio\".)\n\nInterlingua and Esperanto have minor differences regarding precisely how agglutinations occur. For example, Interlingua adds tense endings to the indicative form of a verb (dona → donar), while Esperanto adds them to the stem (don- → doni).\n\nThe orthography of Esperanto is inspired by the Latin alphabets of Slavic languages, and is almost completely phonemic (one sound, one letter). Interlingua, by contrast, uses an orthography established by its Romance, Germanic, and Slavic source languages. Thus, the orthography of Interlingua is much more broad-based but much less regular than that of Esperanto. The procedure used sometimes favored English and the Romance languages, however, resulting in less phonemicity and more familiarity to speakers of those languages.\n\nFor example, the Esperanto \"kontakto\" and the Interlingua \"contacto\" mean the same thing and are pronounced the same, but are written differently because the orthography of Esperanto is simpler: one sound, one letter. Interlingua occasionally departs from this rule, chiefly because the letters \"c\" and \"g\" have hard and soft sounds. Such details make Interlingua more difficult to learn and speak for those who do not know any Romance language, but at the same time may appear more familiar for speakers of Romance or Romance-influenced languages.\n\nUnlike Interlingua, Esperanto uses diacritics. 6 letters (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ) have different pronunciations from their unmarked counterparts (c, g, h, j, s, u). Since they are not treated as mere variations, but as completely different letters, this makes Esperanto a phonemic language. \n\nEsperanto diacritics may be more difficult (or even impossible) to be reproduced by some typing systems that do not recognize its Unicode characters. Historical examples include standard typewriters and older computers; more recent examples include some text editors. In some cases, setup tweaks may be required to enable all letters with diacritics used in Esperanto. \n\nFor cases in which its diacritics cannot be typed, Esperanto has two alternative orthographic systems that replace its letters with diacritics: the H-system, devised by Zamenhoff, and the X-system, devised by more recent Esperantists. They replace the diacritics by a subsequent H or X, respectively; for example, ĉ would be spelled ch in the H-system and cx in the X-system. There is some debate among Esperantists about which system is preferable to use; some argue that only the H-system is legitimate because it was created by Zamenhoff in Fundamento de Esperanto and also looks more natural, while others prefer the X-system because the H already exists in Esperanto, which makes the H-system subject to ambiguity.\n\nSupporters of Interlingua note that their language not only conserves the natural aspect of Western languages, but also their rich, subtle treasury of meanings. Interlingua flows regularly from its Romance, Germanic, and Slavic source languages, and thus it possesses their expressiveness.\n\nEsperanto supporters contend that, by its liberal use of affixes and its flexible word-order, is equally as expressive as Interlingua or indeed any natural language, but is more internationally neutral. While acknowledging that Esperanto is a product of rational construction, not historical evolution, they argue that, after the prolonged usage of more than 100 years, it too has become a living human language.\n\nAlthough no census has ever been undertaken, Esperanto speakers frequently place their numbers at somewhere between 100,000 and 3 million speakers. The number of Interlingua speakers is generally estimated between a few hundred and 1,500. Esperanto is the only constructed language with native speakers, numbering 200-2000 according to \"Ethnologue\".\n\n\n"}

Together with military badges such awards provide an outward display of a service member's accomplishments.\n\nThe first recognized medals of the U.S. Army appeared during the American Civil War and were generally issued by local commanders on an unofficial basis. The Medal of Honor was the first award to be established in regulations as a permanent Army decoration, complete with benefits. The Medal of Honor is the only Civil War era award which has survived as a decoration into the modern age.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Army mandates that all unit awards will be worn separate from individual awards on the opposite side of a military uniform. The Army is the only service to require this separation between unit and individual decorations. All Army unit awards are worn enclosed in a gold frame.\n\nThe Spanish–American War was the first widespread award of campaign medals, both for service in the actual conflict and for participation in subsequent garrison and occupation duty. After the Spanish–American War, however, medals in the U.S. Army fell into disuse and, apart from a few peacetime Medal of Honor decorations, two medals for service in Mexico, or on the border, during the period 1911–17, plus the Civil War Campaign Medal and the Indian Campaign Medal, both finally authorized in 1907, there were no further Army decorations created until the First World War.\n\nWorld War I saw the first widespread distribution of medals for combat, as the Medal of Honor returned awarded for bravery in battle against an enemy force. The Distinguished Service Cross was also created for those soldiers who had performed feats of bravery but not to the level required of the Medal of Honor. The only other medals of World War I were the World War I Victory Medal, accompanied by a confusing array of battle clasps to denote combat participation, and the very belated Army of Occupation of Germany Medal.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the U.S. Army issued very few decorations and it was often common for a service member to spend an entire career without receiving a single medal. As World War II loomed, however, an American Defense Service Medal was created for those on duty, and a Good Conduct Medal began to be issued to enlisted personnel. With the outbreak of the war, the Army began the largest expansion of medals since the Spanish–American War as well as the first wide scale issuance of inter-service awards and decorations. In addition, several World War II campaign medals were created for various theaters and a World War II Victory Medal was established at the end of the conflict as well as an occupation medal.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the Army expanded both its number of medals and ribbons, as well as having its service members eligible for several new inter-service campaign and service medals (such as the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the National Defense Service Medal).\n\nIn the modern age, members of other military branches serving under an Army command are also eligible to receive Army decorations.

{"id": "2104167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104167", "title": "In terrorem", "text": "In terrorem\n\nIn terrorem, Latin for \"into/about fear\", is a legal threat, usually one given in hope of compelling someone to act without resorting to a lawsuit or criminal prosecution.\n\nFor example, many intellectual property attorneys send \"in terrorem\" letters, which threaten litigation absent compliance with the written request, to persons that are violating their clients' trademark rights before resorting to court proceedings.\n\n\"In terrorem\" clauses (referred to in English as no-contest clauses) are also used in wills to keep beneficiaries from contesting the will by either completely disinheriting them from any share, or reducing their share to a nominal amount. These clauses are not uniformly recognized. In some states, in terrorem clauses are disfavored, but can still be enforceable. In New York, for example, the Estates Powers & Trust Law codifies the use of, and the limits of, in terrorem clauses in EPTL 3-3.5(b).\n\nThe term was used in the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision \"Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\", which stated: \"The requirement of allegations suggesting an agreement serves the practical purpose of preventing a plaintiff with \"'a largely groundless claim'\" from \"'tak[ing] up the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so representing an \"in terrorem\" increment of the settlement value'\" (quoting \"Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores\"). In other words, the court worried that the threat of an expensive lawsuit (that was ultimately groundless) would nevertheless encourage settlements, and thus payments by innocent defendants, particularly in the case of antitrust lawsuits, which have a long and very expensive discovery process.\n\nAs the court alluded to in \"Twombly\", the costs associated with discovery often underlay the economic calculus which may motivate the settlement of a \"in terrorem\" strike suit. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 created a heightened pleading standard for cases involving violations of securities regulation in the United States in response to perceptions of abuse in this area. This increased particularity is a departure from the \"notice pleading\" standard enumerated in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which would otherwise apply.\n\n\"In terrorem\" has also been referred to by the High Court of Australia in the 2012 case of \"Andrews v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd\". The unanimous judgement referred to the term when describing the doctrine of penalties and its operation in the case of unfair fees levied by large banks against their customers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2104181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104181", "title": "Industrial arts", "text": "Industrial arts\n\nIndustrial arts is an educational program which features fabrication of objects in wood or metal using a variety of hand, power, or machine tools. Industrial Arts is commonly referred to as Technology Education. It may include small engine repair and automobile maintenance, and all programs usually cover technical drawing as part of the curricula. As an educational term, \"industrial arts\" dates from 1904 when Charles R. Richards of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York suggested it to replace \"manual training\".\n\nIn the United States, industrial arts classes are colloquially known as \"shop class\"; these programs expose children to the basics of home repair, manual craftsmanship, and machine safety. Most industrial arts programs were established in comprehensive rather than dedicated vocational schools and focused on a broad range of skills rather than on a specific vocational training. In 1980, the name of industrial arts education in New York State was changed to \"technology education\" during what was called the \"Figuring Project\". The project goal was to increase students' technological literacy.\n\nIn Victoria (VIC, Australia) industrial arts is still a key part of the high school curriculum. The term now describes a key study of technology that focuses on both engineering and industrial technologies. Additionally, design using the aforementioned technologies is now a key part of the industrial arts curriculum and has been since the mid-1980s when the subject of technics was introduced into Victorian high schools.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of industrial arts is still that while students design they ultimately realize a solution; learning the challenges involved with working with materials and also the challenges of small scale project management.\n\nSome universities have doctoral programs in industrial arts.\n\nAn industrial arts club is an organization that promotes the use of industrial fabrication equipment by the general public. Clubs have grown out of the decline of industrial arts (aka shop class) programs in comprehensive school systems in the US.\nClubs began as student organizations in primary and secondary schools offering industrial, the TechShop and Sparqs Industrial Arts Club based in Massachusetts which grew out of campus activities at MIT.\n\nIndustrial Arts (IA) is an important part of the (NSW) high school curriculum. Industrial Arts syllabi are managed, like all NSW syllabi by the Board of Studies. In some schools Industrial Arts faculties have become part of a larger Technology faculty, however many schools still have a stand-alone Industrial Arts faculty.\n\nThe primary role of Industrial Arts education is to expose students to a variety of industrial and engineering technologies that improve their understanding of the industrial and engineered world. Moreover, students learn both project management and design principles, most courses are project based with students realizing a solution to a design or engineering challenge. Two key components of the projects are synthesis of a solution and evaluation of the final product. Both of these components are the highest order objectives in Bloom's Taxonomy.\n\nIndustrial Arts has a single compulsory course for Years 7 and 8: Technology (Mandatory). This course also has area that cover Home Economics concepts and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) content.\n\nFor Years 9 and 10 all Industrial Arts courses are electives, the three electives on offer are Design and Technology, Graphics Technology and Industrial Technology. The most popular Industrial Arts elective is Industrial Technology.\n\n\nIn Years 11 and 12 Industrial Arts offers three Higher School Certificate (HSC) non-Vocational courses: Design and Technology, Engineering Studies and Industrial Technology.\n\nIn NSW the professional association for Industrial Arts teachers is the Institute of Industrial Arts Technology Education (IIATE). This organisation releases a quarterly journal (on CD) and also runs an annual conference that investigates matters relevant to Industrial Arts education. Moreover, the IIATE represents Industrial Arts teachers in a variety of situations such as syllabus development meetings and teacher training interviews.\n\nAnother important role that The IIATE fulfils is that of Professional Learning. The IIATE has run some very successful training days called \"Hands on Technology\" where teachers are able to build their skills and knowledge in a variety of areas. This \"Hands on\" concept has now been extended with the \"Hands on Engineering\" day now being developed to assist teachers in delivering the Industrial Arts' courses Industrial Technology - Engineering and Engineering Studies.\n\nThe IIATE has also successfully run training programmes for CAD software which has enabled many more teachers to effectively embed CAD into their teaching.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104182", "title": "Sail On, Sailor", "text": "Sail On, Sailor\n\n\"Sail On, Sailor\" is a song by American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1973 album \"Holland\". It was written by Brian Wilson, Ray Kennedy, Tandyn Almer, Jack Rieley, and Van Dyke Parks. It was released as a single in 1973, backed with \"Only with You\", and peaked at number 79 on the American singles charts. A 1975 reissue (also backed with \"Only with You\") charted higher, at number 49. According to Jon Stebbins, \"It is perhaps the only perennial Beach Boys favorite to still thrive in the classic rock and album rock FM radio formats of the present.\"\n\nVan Dyke Parks elaborated upon Wilson's role in the compositional process: \"I went over to Brian's with my new [tape recorder] and told him the name of the tune and sang those intervals, and he pumped out the rest of that song.\" He explains: \"That was a tough moment for both Brian and me. I just went over to see how he was, and he wasn't good. Of course, you couldn't tell that from this song, because it represents such hope, but it came out of a very difficult time.\" Wilson said of the song: \"Van Dyke really inspired this one. We worked on it originally; then, the other collaborators contributed some different lyrics. By the time the Beach Boys recorded it, the lyrics were all over the place. But I love how this song rocks.\"\n\nThere exists a recording of Parks and Wilson writing the song on Wilson's piano. According to Parks, \"it's clear from the contents [of the tape] that I authored the words and the musical intervals to 'Sail on Sailor.' It's also clear that I composed the bridge, played them, and taught them to Brian.\" In the liner notes written for the 2000 reissue of \"Holland\", Scott McCaughey said that the song was originally written by Wilson with his friends Tandyn Almer and Ray Kennedy, and that Parks \"structur[ed] the song and add[ed] a middle-eight\" before Rieley contributed a last minute lyric revision. In 2015, Wilson remembered \"writing 'Sail On, Sailor' with a guy named Ray Kennedy. I wrote the music and he wrote the lyrics.\"\n\nWilson biographer Peter Ames Carlin stated that the song was essentially co-written by Wilson and Parks in 1971, with Kennedy and Almer's lyrical contributions dating from impromptu sessions at Danny Hutton's house during the epoch. Kennedy recalled that \"Sail On, Sailor\" had originally been intended by Wilson for Three Dog Night, and that he had written the song with Wilson over the course of three days in 1970: \"We went in and cut the basic tracks with Three Dog Night; we hadn't slept in about a week. Then Brian got up with a razor blade and cut the tapes and said, 'Only Ray Kennedy or Van Dyke Parks can do this song.' And he left. We all stood there looking at each other going, 'What?' He called me every day after that, and I wouldn't talk to him. Three or four years later, I heard it on the radio and went, 'Who's that?'\"\n\nWhen the Beach Boys submitted the original version of \"Holland\" to Warner Brothers in October 1972, the album was rejected by the company for lacking a potential hit single. After discussion among Warner executives, Parks (who was then director of audio-visual services at the label) said that he had the aforementioned tape of \"Sail On, Sailor\", and suggested that the song could be recorded as the album's lead track. The label then enjoined the Beach Boys to drop what the company perceived as the weakest track (\"We Got Love\") and replace it with the song. Parks commented: \"I'm glad that every one came out of their little rooms to claim co-writing credit on that song. But I never questioned it, just as I never questioned the various claims on the residuals.\"\n\nVocals for \"Sail On, Sailor\" were recorded in late October 1972, some time after the Beach Boys had left Holland. According to Steven Gaines, Wilson initially \"tinker[ed] with the song, trying to make it perfect as he had with 'Good Vibrations' and \"Smile\"\"; following this bout of \"procrastination,\" his bandmates \"did not allow [him] to work on it at all.\" This development left the basic track to be recorded by Brian's brother Carl and ex-Flame and then-Beach Boys members Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin. The lead vocal was first attempted by Dennis Wilson, who sang the vocal once before leaving to go surfing. Carl was the next to attempt a vocal, but he then suggested that Chaplin make an attempt. After two takes, Carl decided that Chaplin's vocal would feature as the lead. Brian acknowledged himself being \"grossly incompetent\" with the song, failing to show up at its backing vocals session, but giving some instructions by phone.\n\nSourced from Scott McCaughey and Craig Slowinski.\n\nThe song was featured in Martin Scorsese's Academy Award-winning film \"The Departed\", and on the motion picture soundtrack CD.\n\n"}
{"id": "2104184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104184", "title": "Blast fishing", "text": "Blast fishing\n\nBlast fishing or dynamite fishing is the practice of using explosives to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection. This often illegal practice can be extremely destructive to the surrounding ecosystem, as the explosion often destroys the underlying habitat (such as coral reefs) that supports the fish. The frequently improvised nature of the explosives used means danger for the fishermen as well, with accidents and injuries.\n\nAlthough outlawed, the practice remains widespread in Southeast Asia, as well as in the Aegean Sea, and coastal Africa. In the Philippines, where the practice has been well-documented, blast fishing was known prior to World War I, as this activity is mentioned by Ernst Jünger in his book \"Storm of Steel\". One 1999 report estimated that some 70,000 fishermen (12% of the Philippines' total fishermen) engaged in the practice.\n\nExtensive hard-to-patrol coastlines, the lure of lucrative, easy catches, and in some cases outright apathy or corruption on the part of local officials make enforcement of blast fishing bans an ongoing challenge for authorities.\nCommercial dynamite or, more commonly, homemade bombs constructed using a glass bottle with layers of powdered potassium nitrate and pebbles or an ammonium nitrate and kerosene mixture are often employed. Such devices, though, may explode prematurely without warning and have been known to injure or kill the person using them, or innocent bystanders.\n\nUnderwater shock waves produced by the explosion stun the fish and cause their swim bladders to rupture. This rupturing causes an abrupt loss of buoyancy; a small amount of fish float to the surface, but most sink to the seafloor. The explosions indiscriminately kill large numbers of fish and other marine organisms in the vicinity and can damage or destroy the physical environment, including extensive damage to coral reefs.\n\nResearchers believe that destructive fishing practices like blast fishing are one of the biggest threats to the coral reef ecosystems. Blown up coral reefs are no more than rubble fields. The long-term impact associated with blast tanks is that there is no natural recovery of the reefs. Coral reefs are less likely to recover from constant disturbance such as blast fishing than from small disturbance that does not change the physical environment. Blast fishing destroys the calcium carbonate coral skeletons and is one of the continual disruptions of coral reefs. In the Indo-Pacific, the practice of blast fishing is the main cause of coral reef degradation. As a result, weakened rubble fields are formed and fish habitat is reduced.\n\nThe damaged coral reefs from blast fishing lead to instant declines in fish species wealth and quantity. Explosives used in blast fishing not only kill fish but also destroy coral skeletons, creating unbalanced coral rubble. The elimination of the fish also eliminates the resilience of the coral reefs to climate change, further hindering their recovery. Single blasts cause reefs to recover over 5–10 years, while widespread blasting, as often practiced, transforms these biodiverse ecosystems into continuous unstable rubble.\n\nIn Tanzania, one of the few methods to help manage blast fishing is a joint approach between fisheries officers and village committees. Working together, they help the enforcement agencies recognize offenders by patrolling the sea as well as providing information collected in the local villages. As a result, this has assisted the enforcement agencies to reduce the occurrence of fish blasting from an average of 8 per day to zero. It has also provided sustainable funding to continue the efficient patrols, a certified planning institution, and suitable training and information to prosecutors and judges.\n\nSimilar patrols employed in Indonesia and the Philippines have reduced the amount of blast fishing occurrences there. Based on dialogue with stakeholder groups in Southeast Asia and people of Tanzania and the Philippines, it is evident that firmer enforcement is an effective strategy in managing blast fishing. Many countries have laws regarding blast fishing, but they are not fully implemented. Effective management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is key in the patrolling of illegal fishing areas.\n\nBesides patrols, the restricting or even banning of the sale of ammonium nitrate also makes it much more difficult to produce the explosives that are needed for blast fishing. Another approach is not to restrict or ban the sale of ammonium nitrate, but instead log the people buying large quantities thereof.\n\nCentrally governed enforcement of blast fishing sometimes has limited success, due to resistance of local populations and mistrust of central governments. Bottom up systems based around clearly defined public benefits and education are more beneficial. Effective MPAs have the backing of local leadership and populations due to clearly defined benefits of conservation/ecosystem services. It has also been shown that effective MPAs have local stakeholders that have accurate perceptions of the environmental health of the region. When coastal residents believe that the ecosystem is healthier than indicators such as species diversity, population, and habitat distribution, they may be less likely to support the MPA. Due to this, effective blast fishing community control relies on education campaigns that bring awareness to the relationship between fish stock and fishing rates.\n\nThis method involves seismic technology developed by the US Government for detecting underwater explosions. Re-adapted for use as background blast monitoring equipment Hong Kong in 1995, first installed in the northeastern waters. Fixed monitoring locations were established in 2006, notably one near to the Jockey Club HSBC WWF Hong Kong Hoi Ha Marine Life Centre. Data from these units were used for discussions with the Marine Police and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). The emphasis for these discussions was placed on protection of the Marine Parks, the last Marine Park bombing occurred in Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in October 1999. With the assistance of community programs from NGO's, education awareness from the AFCD and diligent patrols by the Marine Police Blast fishing was completely eradicated from Hong Kong waters in 2011.\n\nIn 2006 background blast monitoring (BBM) with this same equipment was installed at Mabul Island in Sabah, Malaysia. In 2014 the Reef Defenders began an aggressive program to create a network of blast monitoring systems throughout South-East Asia. BBM is important to guide community-based eradication programs, data collected shows that with the use of community-based programs in tandem with BBM, the levels of blast fishing can be reduced by up to 90%. This has already been observed in multiple areas, more importantly, there is a significant reduction in other destructive fishing methods, shown by recovery in fish stocks.\n\nIn 2015 and 2017, Stop Fish Bombing! conducted proof of concept demonstrations that ShotSpotter urban gunfire system could be adapted for underwater use in Kota Kinabalu and Semporna, Malaysian Borneo protected Marine Parks. In 2018, Stop Fish Bombing USA published research demonstrating real-time fish blast location in Sabah, Malaysia using a networked hydroacoustic array based on the ShotSpotter gunshot location system. In 2020, Stop Fish Bombing's Malaysia team met with Sabah Parks officials to explain the project approach and provide the ShotSpotter Respond App leading to the first apprehension of Fish Bombers by Marine Police in response to Stop Fish Bombing alert.\n\nBlast fishing in Indonesia has been around for over fifty years and continues to transform its one-of-a-kind coral reefs into desolate gray moonscapes, as fishermen continue to use explosives or cyanide to kill or stun their prey. Dive operators and conservationists say Indonesia is not doing enough to protect the waters off the Komodo Islands. They say enforcement declined following the exit of a U.S.-based conservation group that helped fight destructive fishing practices. Coral Gardens that were among Asia's most spectacular dive sites, were the latest victim of bomb blasting despite being located inside the Komodo National Park, a 500,000-acre reserve and U.N. World Heritage Site. The use of bombs made with kerosene and fertilizer is very popular in the region. While previously Komodo was relatively protected by a cooperative undertaking with TNC (The Nature Conservancy) since the Indonesian government has assumed responsibility for park protection, there has been an upsurge in bombing. During a recent visit to Crystal Bommie, it was found to be 60% destroyed, with freshly overturned coral tables proving recent bombing. In the market in the city of Makassar, an estimated 10 to 40 percent of the fish are caught in this manner. The local fishermen find the technique to be easier and more productive than traditional methods. The goal for the country has been to implement stricter policies and fisheries management programs to limit the killing of the fish as well as the destruction of the marine ecosystem. Forty years ago, blast fishing was practiced with dynamite which was in plentiful supply after World War II. Today, fishermen mostly use homemade bombs that are made from bottles filled with an explosive mixture; weights are also added to make the bottle sink faster underwater. After the bomb explodes, the fish killed or stunned by the shock wave from the explosion are collected.\n\nA 1987 study concluded that blast fishing was then very widespread in the Philippines, estimating that 25% of all municipal fish landings (equivalent to 250,000 metric tons per year) were from blast fishing. Most of the blast fishing is however done in the south, near Palawan and the South China Sea. A study conducted in 2002 reported that destructive fishing methods had caused the degradation of about 70% of Philippine coral reefs and reduced annual fisheries production by about 177,500 metric tons in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2010, mayor Nino Rey Boniel of Bien Unido town in the province of Bohol, Philippines, built an underwater grotto along the Danajon reef which deteriorated due to excessive dynamite and cyanide use. Through the help of Sea Knights and Boholano divers, two 14-foot statues of Mother Mary and Santo Nino (Spanish for Holy Child) were placed on 8 September and 18 October 2010 respectively, 60 feet below sea level in order to discourage fishermen from using illegal and destructive methods in fishing and hopefully remind everyone that the sea and its inhabitants are gifts from God that deserves to be treasured and taken care of.\n\nIn 2012, the director of the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources declared an “all-out war” against dynamite fishing and other illegal fishing practices.\n\nIn northern Tanzania, blast fishing, which is illegal, has resurfaced in recent years as a key danger to its coral reefs. This has occurred even though major institutions like local communities and the district government have been put in place for enhanced fisheries management. The damage of blast fishing in the area has contributed to unstable coral reefs, discouragement of tourism investors, and a threat to the habitat of coelacanths in the region. Other impacts of blast fishing in the area include reports that citizens have died or lost limbs due to the blasting. The northern part of the country has many beautiful beaches and uninhabited islands. However, many investors feel that tourists are discouraged due to the fish blasting.\n\nIn Tanzania, coral reefs are essential for both ecological and socio-economic reasons. They are full of fish, lobsters, prawns, crabs, octopuses, mollusks, and sea cucumbers. In addition, coral reefs are one of the major tourist attractions in Tanzania. The coastal tourism provides a living for the people as well as foreign currency for the country. However, there has been an increase in the people living along the coast which has led to a large demand for fisheries. It has led to overexploitation and destructive fishing practices. Blast fishing has been practiced in Tanzania since the 1960s. It was during the 1980s and 1990s that blast fishing was at its peak in Tanzania. For example, in Mnazi bay, Mtwara, 441 blasts were recorded in two months in 1996, and 100 blasts were witnessed through one six-hour period in Mpovi reef.\n\nA 1903 short story by Frank Norris titled \"The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock\" describes efforts to end blast fishing on the American River.\n\nBesides the effectiveness in killing or stunning the fish, another problem with blast fishing is the inefficiency of retrieval. For every ten fish killed, only one or two float to the surface due to damage caused to the internal air bladders of the fish. The rest sink to the bottom.\n\nNaval battles also tend to kill fish with the same effect of blast fishing from shells exploding in the water.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104203", "title": "Algerian Cup", "text": "Algerian Cup\n\nThe Algerian Cup () is a football competition in Algeria, pitting regional teams against each other. It was established in October 1962, three months after independence, and has been played yearly since then apart from 1990 and 1993.\n\nThe most successful clubs in this competition are USM Alger, CR Belouizdad, ES Setif and MC Alger with eight trophies for each. The record for consecutive wins in the competition is only two, several teams have achieved such USM Alger, CR Belouizdad, MC Oran, JS Kabylie and MC Algiers. However, ES Sétif are the only to achieve this twice. CR Belouizdad are the current title holders .\n\nBefore the country's independence, there were several football competitions running on the same system as the Algeria Cup. When the France decided to develop the sport in the colonies, including football, settlers created a number of agencies for the promotion of the sport. To make it more attractive, several types of competitions' cutting \" So were born.\n\nIt already existed at that time, in the late fifties, a similar competition called \"Algeria Cup football\", which was played solely between Algerian clubs but settlers. To get there, one must understand that this was the result of a long process of both sports, political and historical.\n\nWhen football appeared in North Africa, it was not structured enough for organizing major football competitions. At the beginning of, small football challenges appear 1904 and 1905 and criterium in 1911 and 1912. These small competitions désignèrent unofficial champions because regulatory bodies came much later in France (USFSA in 1913 and FFFA in 1919) where chaos reigned for several football federations coexisted.\n\nNorth Africa was then divided into five regions each had a football league. So we had the Morocco Football League Association or LMFA for Morocco; the League of Oran Football Association or LOFA for Oran ut; the League Algiers Football Association or LAFA for Algiers ois; the Constantine Ligue de Football Association or LCFA for Constantine; and Tunisian Football League Association or LTFA for Tunisia.\n\nEach of these leagues organized football championships (between 1920 and 1959) on different levels including the highest honor was called Division (DH ). Meanwhile, a larger football competition appears during the year 1921 called North African Championship. This competition was governed by the Union of North African football leagues created the same year, and included all the champions of honor division of North African football leagues. The winner was crowned \"Champion of North Africa\" and saw himself put an art object. It retained its trophy season and saw the honor of defending his due by being automatically qualified for the next edition accompanied by another club in the league.\n\nThe Forconi Cup was a competition organized by the League Algiers Football Association model \" cut \", and departmental or regional dimension. At that time Algiers was a Department French covering more than 170.000 km2 including the cities of Algiers of Aumale of Blida of Medea of Miliana of Orléansville and Tizi Ouzou. Founded in 1946 at the end of World War II, this competition took place until 1957. This was the only dimension of cutting departmental football in North Africa in the colonial era. The competition was named \"Cup Forconi\" in memory of Edmond Forconi, Vice-President of the Algiers League at this time, after he died as a result of his war wounds. This departmental cut was also very popular because it concerned all teams affiliated to the Algiers League whatever their levels. From 1946 until 1957, the winner of this competition will receive a trophy saw that he kept one season and also had the honor of defending his due but at the stage of final quarters of the competition the next edition. If this system was designed in this way is that the reason was obvious; the winner was also referred to the North African Cup, thus allowing him to devote himself fully to this competition without worrying about the preliminary rounds for the next edition of the Forconi Cup. The competition will disappear as a result of the disappearance of the North African Cup combined with the independence of the Morocco and Tunisia during 1956.\n\nThe Oran Cup was a competition organized by the League of Oran Football Association.\n\nThe 5 July 1962, Algeria gained independence after seven and a half years of war. This is the end of an entire sporting world with the end of football competitions organized by 'settlers'. The clubs 'settlers' stopped in their towers and the clubs \" Muslim \" respawn. The page of football history \"colonial\" turned definitively in North Africa as Algeria, another begins, the football Algerian.\n\nAt independence, many football tournaments are held around the country in order to celebrate the country's independence. Behind the scenes, we are active as can be to organize what became the country's first football championship. It was still only a regional championship called \"Criterium\". All the football system in Algeria of rethinking. However, the main regional leagues were kept, which were renamed \"Western Region\" (former League of Oran), \"Central Region\" (former League of Algiers) and \"East Region\" (former League Constantine). Each of these leagues organized the winners of the playoffs at the end of \" play-off \" to qualify for the finals to determine the first champion of Algeria nationwide.\n\nAlongside the championship, the young Algerian Football Federation chaired by Dr. Mohand Amokrane Maouche, launches another nationwide competition. This was to allow all affiliated clubs to compete in a competition type \"cutting\" nationally.

His image appeared in the \"Berliner Tageblatt\" as \"The Ideal German Soldier\", and was later used in recruitment posters for the Wehrmacht.\n\nGoldberg's father grew up in Königsberg as a member of the Jewish community but he had himself baptized in the local Lutheran church as he wished to become assimilated and marry a Christian. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the senior Goldberg lost his position under the Nazi law of April 1933, Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which expelled Jews from the German Civil Service.\n\nThe 1935 Nuremberg Laws classed persons with at least three Jewish grandparents as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse.\n\nGoldberg left school in 1935 and became an apprentice at \"Schneller und Schmeider\", a clothing company jointly owned by a Jew and a non-Jew, where many of his colleagues were Jews or . Goldberg's maternal uncle joined the Nazi party and refused to be seen with the Goldberg family, even avoiding Goldberg's mother.\n\nAt the beginning of 1938, Goldberg served a six-month term in the Reich Labour Service whose uniform, as Goldberg later recalled, \"had a swastika on an armband\". On December 1, 1938, Goldberg joined the German Army. He took part in the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, serving alongside childhood friend Karl Wolf, whose father was now a high-ranking SS officer.\n\nShortly after the beginning of the war, Goldberg's photograph appeared in the Sunday edition of the \"Berliner Tagesblatt\" newspaper with the caption \"The ideal German soldier\" (\"\"Der ideale deutsche Soldat\"\"); the photograph had been sold to the newspaper by the official army photographer. It was later used on recruitment posters.\n\nIn 1940, following the Armistice with France, Goldberg was expelled from the army under Hitler's order of April 8, 1940, which stated that all first-degree were to be discharged from the military. He returned to his former workplace, which had now changed its name to \"Feodor Schmeider\", having been obliged to remove the Jewish name \"Schneller\". Goldberg played an increasingly more responsible role within the company, obtaining contracts for uniforms from the army and the navy. He also attended the Reich Committee for Labour Studies school (, RAFA), where he was one of the four out of 80 students who passed the test to become a REFA teacher. He then became a Labour Studies Board lecturer on the clothing industry, and delivered lectures to organizations and company directors, even publishing an article in the weekly trade publication \"Textilwoche\".\n\nIn December 1942, Goldberg's father was admitted to hospital. The Gestapo, however, raided the hospital and sent him to a Jewish one which had been requisitioned by the Gestapo for use as a prison, from which Jews were taken and sent to Auschwitz. On Christmas Eve, gambling that the guards would be drunk or absent, Goldberg took his father from the hospital. The elder Goldberg was soon back in the hands of the Gestapo, and in April 1943 was summoned for deportation; Werner told him not to show up, and he was again saved. The father and son were the only members of their immediate family to survive the war.\n\nWerner Goldberg later joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and served twenty years between 1959 and 1979 as a politician in the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin. He died in Berlin on September 28, 2004, aged 84; he was survived by his wife Gertrud Goldberg, and three children.\n\nGoldberg's story formed part of the 2006 documentary \"Hitler's Jewish Soldiers – Nazi-Jews in Hitler's Army\", a 58-minute film produced by Larry Price in association with the Israel Broadcasting Authority. Price's film was inspired by the 2002 book \"Hitler's Jewish Soldiers: The Untold Story of Nazi Racial Laws and Men of Jewish Descent in the German Military\" by Bryan Mark Rigg.\n\nGoldberg featured in the episode \"The Jews Who Fought for Hitler\" of the Yesterday TV series \"Nazi Collaborators\", first screened in the UK in December 2010.\n\nIn 2015, the photograph was used for the monument to \"Protectors of Motherland\" in Tobolsk, Russia, as a surrogate for an image of a Red Army soldier, reportedly by mistake. The image on the monument was promptly fixed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104210", "title": "Crescent College", "text": "Crescent College\n\nCrescent College Comprehensive SJ, formerly known as the College of the Sacred Heart, is a secondary school located on of parkland at Dooradoyle, Limerick, Ireland. The college is one of a number of Jesuit schools in Ireland.\n\nThe Sunday Times table of the top performing 400 schools in Ireland, published in June 2016, placed Crescent College 24th in terms of provision of graduates to university and tertiary colleges, and ranked Crescent as the 5th best school in Munster. According to the Irish Independent, Crescent has educated executives from two of the top three companies in Ireland: Google's John Herlihy and Microsoft's Paul Rellis.\n\nThe first Jesuit school in Ireland was established at Limerick in 1565 by the Apostolic Visitor of the Holy See, David Wolfe. Wolfe had been sent to Ireland in 1563 by Pope Pius IV with the concurrence of the third Jesuit General, Diego Lainez. Wolfe, originally from a Limerick merchant family, joined the Jesuits at Rome in 1550, and was appointed Rector of the College at Modena at the recommendation of Loyola.\n\nWolfe arrived in Ireland with another Irish Jesuit called 'Dermot' in January 1561, and had been charged with correcting \"all manner of lapses from the church, and chiefly heresies and schismatical faults\", and also to set up grammar schools \"as a remedy against the profound ignorance of the people\". In 1565 he founded the first Irish Counter-Reformation school at Limerick, which opened at Castle Lane, and was entrusted to the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).\n\nWolfe delegated the administration of the school to Edmund O'Donnell, better known as Daniel. Another Jesuit from England, William Good joined Daniel soon after, though they had a turbulent relationship. Originally it had been proposed, with Primate Richard Creagh's approval, that Good would be appointed rector of a Catholic university foundation in Ireland, which was intended to be established at Limerick. Good had been a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and late headmaster of Wells Grammar School, under Queen Mary I. He had abandoned a career in the Anglican Church, having been a Canon at Wells Cathedral, and left for the continent when the Church of England was re-established after the accession of Elizabeth I in 1562. Archbishop Creagh's plans for a Catholic university came to nothing and instead, Good was assigned to teaching at the Limerick foundation.\n\nA number of Good's reports survive in the Jesuit archives at Rome and he records an early example of a school play in Ireland, which was performed on the Feast of St John in 1566. It was decided that the education offered should be free, based only on voluntary contributions, in the spirit of Ignatius's Roman College founded 14 years before, where no fee was requested from pupils.\n\nDespite the goodwill of the City Council, in late 1568 the Castle Lane School, in the presence of Daniel and Good, was attacked and looted by government agents sent by Sir Thomas Cusack during the pacification of Munster. The political and religious climate had become more uncertain in the lead up to Pope Pius V's formal excommunication of the Queen, which resulted in a new wave of repression of Catholicism in England and Ireland. This had implications for the Castle Lane school which, for a time, had to move out of the city and was placed under the Earl of Desmond's protection at Kilmallock in County Limerick. Later, the school was able to move back to the city for a short time, However, in 1568 the Anglican Bishop of Meath, Hugh Brady, was sent to Limerick charged with a Royal Commission to seek out and expel the Jesuits. Daniel was immediately ordered to quit the city and went to Lisbon, where he resumed his studies with the Portuguese Jesuits. Good moved on to Clonmel, before establishing himself at Youghal until 1577.\n\nIn 1571, after Wolfe had been captured and imprisoned at Dublin Castle. Daniel persuaded the Portuguese Province to agree a surety for the ransom of Wolfe, who was quickly banished on release. Daniel returned to Ireland the following year, but was immediately captured and incriminating documents were found on his person, which were taken as proof of his involvement with the rebellious cousin of the Earl of Desmond, James Fitzmaurice and a Spanish plot. He was removed from Limerick, taken to Cork \"just as if he were a thief or noted evildoer\". After being court-martialled by the Lord President of Munster, Sir John Perrot, he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered for treason and refused pardon in return for swearing the Act of Supremacy. His execution was carried out on 25 October 1572 and a report of it was sent by Fitzmaurice to the Jesuit Superior General in 1576, where he said that Daniel was \"cruelly killed because of me\". His execution was memorialized in a number of contemporary woodcuts printed at Prague.\n\nWith Daniel dead and Wolfe dismissed, the Irish Jesuit foundation suffered a severe setback. Good is recorded as resident at Rome by 1577 and in 1586 the seizure of Earl of Desmond's estates resulted in a new permanent Protestant plantation in Munster, making the continuation of the Limerick school impossible for a time. It wasn't until the early 1600s that the Jesuit Mission could again re-establish itself in the city, though the Jesuits kept a low profile existence in lodgings here and there. For instance a mission led by Fr Nicholas Leinagh re-established itself at Limerick in 1601, though the Jesuit presence in the city numbered no more than 1 or 2 at a time in the years immediately following. \n\nIn 1604 the Lord President of Munster, Sir Henry Brouncker - at Limerick, ordered all Jesuits from the city and Province, and offered £7 to anyone willing to betray a Jesuit priest to the authorities, and £5 for a Seminarian. Jesuit houses and schools throughout the Province, in the years thereafter, were subject to periodic crackdown and the occasional destruction of schools, imprisonment of teachers and the levying of heavy money penalties on parents are recorded in publications of the time. In 1615-17 the Royal Visitation Books, written up by Thomas Jones, the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, records the suppression of Jesuit schools at Waterford, Limerick and Galway.. Nevertheless, spite of this occasional persecution, the Jesuits were able to exert a degree of discreet influence within the Province and city. For instance in 1606, largely through their efforts, a Catholic named Christopher Holywood was elected Mayor of the city. . Four years earlier the resident Jesuit had raised a sum of '200 cruzados' for the purpose of founding a hospital in the city, though the project was disrupted by a severe outbreak of plague and repression by the Lord President \n\nThe principal activities of the Order within the city at this time were devoted to preaching, administration of the sacraments and teaching. The School opened and closed intermittently in or around the area of Castle Lane, near Lahiffy's lane. During demolition work Stones marked I.H.S., 1642 and 1609 were, in the 19th century, found inserted in a wall behind a tan yard near St Mary's Chapel which, according to Lenihan, were thought to mark the site of an early Jesuit School and Oratory. This building, at other times, had also functioned as a dance house and candle factory.\nIn the latter half of the 17th Century the Limerick Jesuit foundation began to establish a more permanent and stable presence and the Jesuit Annals record a 'flourishing' school at Limerick in the 1640s. During the Confederacy the Jesuits had been able to go about their business unhindered and were invited to preach publicly from the pulpit of St Mary's Cathedral on 4 occasions. Cardinal Rinuccini wrote to the Jesuit General in Rome praising the work of the Rector of the Limerick College, Fr William O’Hurley, who was aided by Fr Thomas Burke.. However just a few years later, during the Protectorate era, only 18 of the Jesuits resident in Ireland managed to avoid capture by the authorities. Lenihan records that the Limerick College SJ, in 1656, moved to a hut in the middle of a bog which was difficult for the authorities to find. This foundation was headed up by Fr Nicholas Punch who was aided by Frs Maurice Patrick, Piers Creagh and James Forde and the school attracted a large number of students from around the locality.\n\nAt the Restoration of Charles II the school moved back to Castle Lane, and remained largely undisturbed for the next 40 years, until the surrender of the city to Williamite forces in 1692. In 1671 Dr James Douley was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Limerick and during his visitation to the Diocese reported to the Holy See that the Jesuits had a house and 'taught schools with great fruit, instructing the youth in the articles of faith and good morals'. Dr Douley also noted that this and other Catholic schools operating in the Diocese were also attended by local Protestants.\n\nThe Jesuit presence in Ireland, in the so-called Penal era after the Battle of the Boyne, ebbed and flowed. By 1700 they were only 6 or 7, recovering to 25 by 1750. Small Jesuit houses and schools existed at Athlone, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Waterford, New Ross, Wexford, and Drogheda, as well as Dublin and Galway. At Limerick there appears to have been a long hiatus following the defeat of the Jacobite forces and Begley states that Fr Thomas O'Gorman was the first Jesuit to return to Limerick after the siege, arriving in 1728 and he took up residence in Jail Lane, near the Castle in the Englishtown. There he opened a school to 'impart the rudiments of the classics to the better class youth of the city. Fr O'Gorman left in 1737 and was succeeded by Fr John McGrath. Next came Father James McMahon, who was a nephew of the Primate of Armagh, Hugh MacMahon. Fr McMahon lived at Limerick for thirteen years until his death in 1751. In 1746 Father Joseph Morony was sent from Bordeaux to join Father McMahon and the others. Fr Morony remained at the Jail Lane site teaching at what Begley states was a 'high class school' until 1773 when he was ordered to close the School and Oratory following the Papal suppression of the Society of Jesus, 208 years after its foundation by Wolfe. Fr Morony then went to live in Dublin and worked as a secular priest.\n\nDespite the efforts of the Castle authorities and English government the Limerick school managed to survive the Protestant Reformation, the Cromwellian invasion and Williamite Wars, and subsequent Penal Laws. It was finally forced to close, not for religious or confessional reasons, but due to the political difficulties of the Jesuit Order elsewhere.\n\nSome commemorative inscription stones from Castle Lane, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, were built into the external walls of the old Georgian school buildings at the Crescent in Limerick city centre. Another stone from the Castle Lane site, inscribed with a cross and the motto IHS, dated 1642 was brought to Dooradoyle in 1973 and was placed above the 1973 Foundation stone of the present site.\n\nFollowing the restoration of the Society of Jesus in 1814, the Jesuits gradually re-established a number of their schools throughout the country, starting with foundations at Kildare and Dublin. They returned to Limerick at the invitation of the Bishop of Limerick, Dr. John Ryan, in 1859 and also re-established a school at Galway in the same year. Negotiations between the Order and the Diocese of Limerick were conducted at Rome rather than Ireland, and it was agreed that the new school would be a day school only. The Irish Vice Provincial, Fr Joseph Lentaigne, reluctantly agreed given the demands of existing Irish Jesuit Houses and at the beginning of the 1859 school year the Bishop's school was entrusted to Jesuit management. The pioneer Jesuit community in 1859 consisted in Frs. Edward Kelly (1824-1905) (Rector), Thomas Kelly (1829-1898), Peter Foley (1826-1893), Edmund Hogan (1831-1917), Matthew Saurin (1825-1901), and one scholastic, Mr. Matthew Russell (1834-1912).\n\nThis diocesan college operated initially at premises in Hartstone Street, which had been occupied by the Sisters of the Faithful Companions of Jesus, before they purchased Laurel Hill House and established a school for girls there. Paul Connolly, from a Limerick City family, was the first pupil enrolled, and also attending that day was the future Bishop of Limerick, Edward O'Dwyer.\n\nThe curriculum included ancient classics, mathematics, and modern languages (English and French). German was added later and the school prospectus advertised that boys were to be prepared \"for the University and the Ecclesiastical Colleges; for the Learned Professions; for the Public Service – Civil and Military; and for the department of Mercantile and Commercial Life\".\n\nIn 1862 the Jesuits acquired Crescent House and three neighbouring buildings towards the southern end of the Georgian Crescent. Crescent House was a large city residence which had been vacated by a local banking family, the Russells. By tradition Mr Richard Russell, while in residence, had ordered all the blinds of the house closed so he wouldn't have to look upon John Hogan's statute of Daniel O'Connell, recently erected in the middle of the Crescent. The Georgian house on the Crescent property had a large garden and a number of vacant neighbouring sites, offering possibilities for expansion. However the Jesuits had paid a large sum for Crescent House and they initially postponed plans for a neighbouring church until this debt was lessened. It wasn't until 1864 that the execution of plans for the church commenced and although the garden of Crescent House was large, it wasn't sufficient to house the new church so additional properties had to be purchased.\n\nAt this time the school suffered a setback when the Jesuits quarreled with Bishop Ryan's successor, Dr George Butler. The Limerick community had taken a neutral stance during the 1868 election, which caused a caustic response from the local clergy and press, and a number of boys were withdrawn from the school as a result. Accordingly, Bishop Butler removed the Diocesan College from their care, moving it back to Hartstone Street. The Jesuits, however, continued with their own school at the newly acquired buildings at the Crescent, which became independent of the Diocese and was renamed Sacred Heart College.\nThe school at the Crescent, and the attached chapel, were dedicated first to St Aloysius Gonzaga, but rededicated to the Sacred Heart in 1868 after the school chapel was enlarged and opened for public worship. This was the first church and school in Ireland dedicated to the cult of the Sacred Heart, popularised centuries before in France by Claude de la Colombiere, S.J. Sacred Heart College, like Belvedere College in Dublin, became recognised by the name of its premises, and was popularly known as Crescent College, or \"the Crescent\". Crescent was a fee-paying school catering in the main to the city's growing Catholic middle class, and received no government support. In its early years Sacred Heart (Crescent) College struggled to survive in competition with the Bishop's school and many students enrolled in the preparatory school left for boarding schools as they became older. The Province accordingly sent a new generation of able Jesuit administrators to get the college back on its feet, including Thomas A. Finlay and Peter Finlay in 1879, which brought a new vigour. When the results of the first nationwide Intermediate Examinations were published in 1879 a Crescent boy, Charles Doyle (later a Judge of the King's Bench), obtained first place in Ireland. This was seen as a victory for Catholic schools in receipt of no public endowment or subsidy and messages of congratulation were sent from many quarters, including the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Walsh.\n\nFurther innovations came in 1874 when the rector, Fr William Ronan, S.J., invited a French Jesuit colleague Fr Jean Baptiste René to establish an Apostolic College at Crescent House as a seminary for men of little means. This proved a success, but overcrowding with the day pupils necessitated expansion. An appeal was launched to the Bishops of Ireland and by their aid the Jesuits were able to acquire an adjoining house beside the College in 1880. In September 1882 the Apostolic College relocated to new premises at Mungret, with funds provided by a local Catholic nobleman, the Earl of Emly. These schools were again to be joined together when Mungret College merged with Crescent in 1974.\n\nDuring the national struggle for independence, 1916–1922, a Jesuit called Fr. William Hackett established the Crescent Volunteers.\n\nFr Hackett was disappointed with the results of his efforts and lamented the presence of many 'seonins' in Crescent College - and the Volunteers were shut down by the rector in 1917, though training camps were still being held as late as 1920. Masked Crown forces raided the school on two occasions in November 1920.\n\nIn 1939, the school population remained under 130 – but by the 1940s it grew to 300 boys, rising to over 500 by the 1960s. A biography of Fr William Hackett reveals his belief that parents who sent their children to Jesuit schools were \"making their way into the upper middle class on the back of the Jesuit vow of poverty\". Hackett was not unique in this view, and the Generalship of Pedro Arrupe urged the Jesuits to return to the original Ignatian vision and the spirit of the early Jesuit schools. As part of this reflection many Jesuit schools re-evaluated their role. In Britain, four Jesuit schools became Comprehensive in the 1960s, and it was proposed that the Crescent in Limerick and Gonzaga College in Dublin should adopt a comprehensive curriculum in a new relationship with the Minister for Education, and cease to be fee-paying schools. Negotiations opened in the late 1960s at the invitation of the then Minister and former pupil Donagh O'Malley, who had been a classmate of the Jesuit Provincial, Cecil McGarry, S.J. The comprehensive scheme proceeded in Limerick only, and this ushered in a period of reform and expansion under Fr Thomas Morrissey: the name Sacred Heart College was dropped and \"Crescent College Comprehensive SJ\" adopted in recognition of the more common name of the school.\n\nThe redesignation of the school as a comprehensive was not without controversy and the Limerick Trades Council complained in the media of the unsuitability of Jesuits to run such a school, given their association with upper-class education. The board of management met with the Council and argued that the Society's schools in Limerick before the suppression had been free. The government's new scheme, they argued, gave the Society an opportunity to return to its earlier tradition, bringing the benefits of Jesuit education to all classes.\n\nIn 21st century review of a work on the history of the Crescent, edited by Anthony White and published for the sesquicentenary of the College, Dr Daire Keogh of DCU critiques an article written by Fr Morrissey. Keogh argued that the Jesuit initiative at Limerick didn't reflect the 'option for the poor' as promoted by Pedro Arrupe. Rather, he argued, the accommodation at Limerick reflected \"the desire of the Minister for Education to secure a Jesuit endorsement for a new model of schooling, approval which would lift the [SIC middle classes view] of what were often dubbed 'contraceptive schools'\".\n\nIn 1971, the Georgian school buildings at Crescent House were found to be structurally unsound, overcrowded, and not adaptable to expansion. Some thought was given to a relocation to Mungret College, but after consideration the Mungret site was deemed to be too far outside the city catchment area. Instead land was purchased at Dooradoyle in 1973, resulting in the demolition of the McMahon historical seat (a family closely related to the French Dukes of Magenta). Shortly afterwards the Crescent Shopping Centre opened beside the school from which it was named.\n\nIn 1978 Crescent became the first Irish Jesuit school to become partially co-educational, with a ratio of 3 boys to 1 girl, and Coláiste Iognáid Galway followed later The preparatory school, which had remained at Crescent House, was phased out over 5 years after the transfer of the senior school to Dooradoyle and closed in 1978 as the Department of Education declined to allow boys an automatic right of entry to the secondary school. At Dooradoyle a number of curriculum changes were undertaken and Crescent, along with Gonzaga in Dublin, became the first schools in Ireland to offer a transition year. Other changes, such as a Classical Studies programme in the 1970s and a special \"Irish Studies\" programme for first years, were later phased out and not adopted in other schools. In the 1980s, in collaboration with then National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick (subsequently UL), students from Crescent were able to study computer and technology courses at Leaving Certificate level, allowing entry to third level courses.\nIn June 2015 Crescent beat 25 other schools in the Irish Science Teachers' Association Junior Science Quiz. In 2011 they won a European Space Agency competition and represented Ireland in Norway, finishing third among teams from fourteen countries, with their satellite in a can.\n\nGirls' hockey and boys' rugby are the main sports, though many other contact and noncontact activities are offered. The girls have competed in futsal. Rugby at Crescent developed from the late 1940s under coach Fr. Gerry Guinane, and in that time Crescent had some success in the Munster Schools Senior Cup, constituting one of the big five rugby schools in Munster and seeded in the top 8 schools at Provincial level. It has won a number of senior titles since the cup's inception in 1909, winning the Schools Senior Cups on rugby 11 occasions in 1947, 1949, 1951, 1963, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2013 and 2014. The school is represented nationally at club level by Old Crescent RFC, which is now an open club.\n\nIn 2010 Crescent was named Munster rugby and hockey School of the Year, and in 2011 Richard Butler, Chairman of Limerick County Council, hosted a reception at the County Hall to mark the sporting achievements of the school in that year. The girls' hockey team won the Kate Russell All-Ireland Hockey Championship in 2015. Both boys and girls have represented the Munster and Irish teams in rugby and hockey at various levels. In 2017, the boys won the all-Ireland basketball title. The college won the Munster Irish Schools Championship in golf in 2008 at senior level and 2011 at junior level.\n\nAccording to some media outlets in Limerick, \"the school has a long-standing successful reputation for drama and the performing arts\". The school has an award-winning choir and orchestra, taking part annually in the Feis Ceoil classical music festival at the RDS in Dublin, Winning first place in 1996 and second place in 1984, 2005 and 2006. In 2013 a 30-member Orchestra and 65 strong choir recorded a song for the Waltons Music for Schools Competition and achieved 2nd place nationally at a performance in the National Concert Hall, Dublin. An annual musical school show raises money for charity. and the school orchestra gives a public concert at Christmas.\n\nThe College also maintains an active chapter of the Society of St Vincent de Paul, which has an annual 'sleep out'. Other activities include the 'Fast Friends' programme and the Arrupé Project in Africa. Students also participate in mandatory social placement programme for fifth-year students. In line with its objective of educating men and women for others, in 2011 the school hosted the opening of the website \"Why Care?\" which is run by the Jesuit Center for Faith and Justice in Dublin. It seeks to keep teachers and students alike abreast of social problems afflicting Ireland.\n\nCrescent now sits on 40 acres of grounds and gardens landscaped by Fr William Troddyn and the late school gardener, P.J. Brennan, who together 'purloined' clippings and bulbs from the Limerick region in order to use on the grounds of Crescent, including an avenue of copper beeches. The school also maintains a nature garden to attract wildlife to the campus.\n\nToday the school operates under the joint trusteeship of the Society of Jesus and the Minister for Education, with the Jesuit Provincial appointing a majority on the Board of Management and the chair of the board is someone appointed by him. The ethos is Jesuit and Catholic though most of the current teaching staff are lay-persons, and a number of Jesuit priests live on campus at the residence, Della Strada, which hosts the Jesuit Refugee Service. In 2001 the school appointed its first lay headmaster.\n\nCrescent offers a six-year curriculum, and classes are divided into five lines, each named after a Jesuit patron.\n\nIn June 2006, Sacred Heart Church closed, ending the connection of 150 years with Crescent House – from which the school took its name. A House of Prayer and Spirituality has located at the Jesuit Residence in Dooradoyle.

Most United States territorial courts are defunct because the territories under their jurisdiction have become states or been retroceded.\n\nThere are three currently operating United States territorial courts:\n\nTheir jurisdiction is similar to that of United States district courts, but despite the similarity of names, they are not \"United States district courts\" (though they sometimes use that term). \"United States district courts\", created under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, exist only in United States federal judicial districts, which are found only in the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe territorial courts themselves, as article IV courts, also assume the jurisdiction of a United States bankruptcy court in their respective territories; they do not have separate bankruptcy courts under their supervision, as do the article III U.S. district courts.\n\nArticle IV judges do not have the authority to decide petitioners' appeals or be appointed to a United States Court of Appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court case \"Nguyen v. United States\", 540 U.S. 935 (2003), presented the question of whether a panel of the Court of Appeals consisting of two Article III judges and one Article IV judge had the authority to decide petitioners' appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court declared that it did not.\n\nThere is no federal court in the territory of American Samoa. Matters of federal law arising in American Samoa have generally been adjudicated in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii or the District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThough they could be considered \"territorial courts\" in a semantic sense (since their jurisdictions are not states), the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico are \"not\" U.S. territorial courts since D.C. and Puerto Rico are Article III federal judicial districts.\n\nIn addition, the District of Columbia has two other local courts, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which hear cases involving D.C. local law only. Though their jurisdiction is similar to state courts, like other federal courts they were created by Congress and their final appellate court is the Supreme Court of the United States. Like the D.C. federal courts, they are \"territorial courts\" in a semantic sense, but are \"not\" truly U.S. territorial courts. However, these courts are not Article III courts, as the judges serve only 15-year terms.\n\nThe American legal system includes both state courts and federal courts. Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands have their own courts which hear cases involving commonwealth law. Though they could be called \"territorial courts\" by some (since a U.S. commonwealth is a type of territory), they are \"not\" U.S. territorial courts as they were created by the commonwealths themselves and not by Congress; except for being in commonwealths, they are the same as state courts.\n\nIn 1961 Congress legislated to provide Puerto Rico with a judicial state-federal\ncourt structure equal to that of States. At the time, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reviewed not only judgments of the federal district court, but those of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court as well. This changed with , which provided that review of Puerto Rico Supreme Court judgments would now be before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOn \"Balzac v. Porto Rico\", 258 U.S. 298 (1922) the U.S. Supreme Court concluded as an argument of non-incorporation:\n\nThe United States District Court (in Puerto Rico) is not a true United States court established under Article 3 of the Constitution to administer the judicial power of the United States therein conveyed. It is created by virtue of the sovereign congressional faculty, granted under Article 4, §3, of the Constitution, of making all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The resemblance of its jurisdiction to that of true United States courts, in offering an opportunity to nonresidents of resorting to a tribunal not subject to local influence, does not change its character as a mere territorial court.\n\nIn \"Glidden Co. v. Zdanok\", supra, the court made the following statement regarding courts in unincorporated territories:\n\nUpon like considerations, Article III has been viewed as inapplicable to courts created in unincorporated territories outside the mainland, \"Downes v. Bidwell\", 182 U.S. 244, 266 -267; \"Balzac v. Porto Rico\", 258 U.S. 298, 312 -313; cf. \"Dorr v. United States\", 195 U.S. 138, 145 , 149, and to the consular courts established by concessions from foreign countries, \"In re Ross\", 140 U.S. 453, 464-465, 480. \n\nThe Article Three of the United States Constitution, establishes the judicial branch of the federal government. This constitutional article was expressly extended to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress through the federal law 89-571, 80 Stat. 764, and signed by the President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966. From this moment on, judges appointed to serve on the Puerto Rico federal district court have been Article III judges appointed under the Constitution of the United States. In addition in 1984 one of the judges of the federal district court, Chief Judge Juan R. Torruella, a native of the island, was appointed to serve in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico, Massachusetts,\nRhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire.\n\nIn 1966 President Lyndon Johnson signed which\ntransformed the Article IV federal district court in Puerto Rico to an Article III Court. This Act of\nCongress was not conducted pursuant to Article IV of the Constitution, the Territorial Clause,\nbut rather under Article III. This marks the first and only occasion in United States history in\nwhich Congress establishes an Article III Court in a territory other than the District of Columbia.\nFrom this moment on, judges appointed to serve on the Puerto Rico federal district court have\nbeen Article III judges appointed under the Constitution of the United States. Like their\nmainland brethren they are entitled to life tenure and salary protection. Senate Report 1504 reveals\nthe reason for the enactment of this Law:\n\nThere does not appear any reason why the U.S. District Judges for the District of Puerto Rico should not be placed in a position of parity as to tenure with all other Federal Judges throughout our judicial system. Moreover, federal litigants in Puerto Rico should not be denied the benefit of judges made independent by life tenure from the pressures of those who might influence his chances of reappointment, which benefits the Constitution guarantees to the litigants in all other Federal Courts. These judges in Puerto Rico have and will have the exacting same heavy responsibilities as all other Federal district judges and, therefore, they should have the same independence, security, and retirement benefits to which all other Federal district judges are entitled.\n\nThis important change in the federal judicial structure of the island was implemented not as a request of the Commonwealth government, but rather at the repeated request of the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n\nBetween 1966 and 2008, eighteen Article III judges were appointed to sit in the District of Puerto Rico.\n\n"}

{"id": "2104246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104246", "title": "WNCX", "text": "WNCX\n\nWNCX (98.5 FM) – branded 98.5 WNCX – is a commercial classic rock radio station licensed to Cleveland, Ohio, serving Greater Cleveland and much of surrounding Northeast Ohio. Owned by Entercom, WNCX serves as a co-flagship station for the Cleveland Browns Radio Network; the Cleveland affiliate for \"Little Steven's Underground Garage\"; and the radio home of Michael Stanley. The WNCX studios are located at the Halle Building in Downtown Cleveland, while the station transmitter resides in the Cleveland suburb of North Royalton. Besides a standard analog transmission, WNCX broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via Radio.com.\n\nThe station first went on the air in 1948 as WERE-FM and was the FM outlet for , where it primarily simulcast the programming of its more popular AM sister station over the next 24 years. Founded by former Cleveland mayor Raymond T. Miller's Cleveland Broadcasting Incorporated, WERE-FM actually signed on one year prior to its AM counterpart.\n\nDuring the 1950s, WERE, and by extension, WERE-FM, was the first popular Top 40 station in the market, spearheaded by now-legendary personalities like Bill Randle, \"Captain\" Carl Reese, Phil McLean, Ronnie Barrett, Howie Lund and Bob Forster. Randle was the most influential of the group, as he was the first major-market disk jockey in the Northeast United States to play Elvis Presley, and bolstered the careers of a number of up-and-coming musicians, including The Four Lads, Bobby Darin, and Fats Domino. Future NBC announcer and voice-over artist Danny Dark also was a host on WERE in the early 1960s.\n\nAfter Raymond T. Miller's death in 1966, Cleveland Broadcasting Incorporated was acquired by Atlantic States Industries (ASI) for a combined $9 million in May 1968. Due to ASI already owning five AM stations and one FM station, and because of an interim policy/proposed rule by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that prohibited the purchase of an AM and FM station in the same market—the \"one-to-a-customer\" policy—the FCC ordered the divestiture of WERE-FM, along with WLEC and WLEC-FM in Sandusky, to a third party. WLEC and WLEC-FM were divested to RadiOhio that December, and WERE-FM was sold to L. E. Chenault (of Drake-Chenault Enterprises) concurrently; both deals fell through. WLEC AM/FM were ultimately retained by the sellers and spun off to a limited partnership, Lake Erie Broadcasting.\n\nKFAC and KFAC-FM in Los Angeles were given waivers to the \"one-to-a-customer\" policy, and the deal was approved by the commission on October 29, 1969, on the condition that WERE-FM would be sold \"as soon as practicable.\" General Cinema Corporation acquired WERE-FM in May 1970 for $525,000, the deal was approved that July; ASI was later granted a tax break by the FCC with the sale. \n\nWERE-FM's call letters were then changed to WGCL on December 16, 1970, and programming changed from a fully automated format to Top 40 as \"G98\". WGCL began as an affiliate of the Drake-Chenault \"Solid Gold\" and \"Hit Parade\" formats, which featured a Top 40/Oldies mix, but eventually went live and local with personalities such as Tim Davisson, David Mark and Mike Dix (formerly of the legendary WIXY 1260). Famed programmer Lee Abrams helmed the station, and George Jay was its news director.\n\nGeneral Cinema sold WGCL to Olivia-Neuhoff Broadcasting on August 9, 1976 for $2.5 million; the sale came in the wake of years of litigation over a proposed purchase and format change of WEFM in Chicago, as well as lost revenue and advertisers over a failed format change at WGKA, GCC's former AM station in Atlanta. Olivia-Neuhoff was headed up by George Olivia, Jr. and WERE general manager Paul Neuhoff; they had also acquired WERE from ASI for $3.1 million that April, reuniting both stations. Despite the sale, both stations kept \"GCC Communications of Cleveland\" as the licensee name until they were sold again in 1986.\n\nDuring the next 14 years, the station would go on to enjoy moderate success in the face of significant competition from crosstown rock juggernaut, WMMS. WGCL enjoyed some of the areas best-known air personalities over time, such as: J. Michael Wilson, Bumper Morgan, Dave Sharp, Howard Perl, Uncle Vic & Rick Allen. Of course, one of G98's most recognized air personalities throughout the 1980s was \"Dancin\" Danny Wright, who later had a long stretch in afternoon drive at country WGAR-FM. He later hosted a nationally syndicated show, Jones Radio Network's \"Danny Wright All Night\".\n\nWGCL's best showing in the Cleveland Arbitron ratings was in 1982 when they briefly overtook WMMS in the top overall position, but after WMMS re-tooled and recaptured first place a short time later, WGCL slowly lost ground.\n\nWGCL and WERE were sold by George Olivia's GCC Communications to Detroit-based Metropolis Broadcasting on June 18, 1986, for a combined $10 million. After the deal was completed, Metropolis changed WGCL's call letters to WNCX on October 22, 1986 (WNCX was to have stood for \"North Coast eXpress\", but was downplayed entirely after Metropolis failed to service mark the slogan and WMMS did).\n\nThe planned new format for the station notably boasted a large on and off-air staff composed mostly of Cleveland radio veterans–eight of whom had directly departed WMMS. This included: John Gorman, former WMMS program director, as WNCX operations manager; Denny Sanders, 15-year WMMS veteran, as WNCX program director and afternoon host; Rhonda Kneifer, former WMMS program coordinator, as WNCX music director; Paul Tapie, former WGAR (1220 AM) morning host, in the same capacity; former WHK (1420 AM) program director and air personality Bernie Kimble, as midday host; \"Spaceman Scott\" Hughes, formerly of WMMS, as evening host; and Nancy Alden, formerly of WKDD (96.5 FM) in Akron, as late night host. Recorded station IDs and imaging were created by acclaimed \"Word Jazz\" artist Ken Nordine.\n\nTo signal a sign of the changes to come, after WGCL's CHR format was dropped on October 20, the station stunted by playing Beatles records non-stop for 72-hours. WNCX's permanent eclectic rock/top 40 mixed format was unveiled afterward; Sanders and Gorman promised \"a much different sound than other stations,\" and that they would \"play a wide variety of music, 360 degrees of rock 'n' roll, from old to new to R&B,\" emphasizing new music, local records and included a Saturday night dance club music show. The station also billed itself as one of the first radio stations in Cleveland to have a complete on-air library made up of compact discs.\n\nDue to the last minute inability by Metropolis Broadcasting to buy out his contract (which Gorman and Sanders were promised) and his incompatibility with the new format, Danny Wright was moved to the overnight slot for several weeks as a board-op with no speaking role whatsoever to finish out his contract.\n\nFive months into the station's high-visibility launch, in February 1987, WNCX abruptly switched formats to classic hits; employing Mike McVay's consulting firm. While the existing staff remained in place at first, Gorman promptly departed, and later filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Metropolis. By April, Rhonda Kiefer, Spaceman Scott and Nancy Alden left; followed shortly thereafter by Bernie Kimble, then Denny Sanders at the end of August; Paul Tapie was the only on-air staffer from the previous format that remained. WNCX's relaunch as a classic hits station at first featured a mix of pop-rock classic artists like Elton John, Paul McCartney and Cat Stevens, with little promotion and dramatically reduced expenses under consultant Mike McVay; McVay had prior experience as former program director and general manager at WMJI.\n\nMost of the dismissed personalities enjoyed longevity and success in the market elsewhere: John Gorman became WMJI program director in 1991, and again at WMMS in 1994, later establishing internet radio station oWOW Radio; Sanders joined WMJI in 1988 and succeeded Gorman as program director in 1996; Spaceman Scott went to WRQK in Canton as program director, then rejoined WMMS in the early 90s; Nancy Alden went to WDOK later in 1987 and was a fixture at that station for many years; Bernie Kimble joined WNWV as program director; and newscaster Jack Speer is currently a news anchor for NPR in Washington, D.C.\n\nThroughout January 1987, Metropolis entered in negotiations to purchase WWDC and WWDC-FM in Washington, D.C. for $53 million, but a tentative deal was never fully reached. As it turned out, Metropolis wound up exiting broadcasting completely within the next 18 months; WDTX in Detroit—their sole other station—was sold for $12 million in March 1988, and Metropolis co-owner Harvey Deutch died from cancer the following month. WNCX and WERE were then put on the block, leading most observers to conclude that Metropolis Broadcasting was poorly organized and financed right from the start.\nCleveland-based Metroplex Communications, in a joint venture with area jeweler Larry Robinson, purchased both stations in July 1988 for $11.6 million. Metroplex was headed by Norman Wain and Bob Weiss, who once owned WIXY (1260 AM) and WDOK in the late 1960s; Robinson also had previous station ownership experience—having owned WIXY's successor WBBG (1260 AM), along with WMJI—in the early 1980s.\n\nDespite having little promotion and advertising, in sharp contrast to the prior eclectic top 40/rock format, the classic hits format proved to be a ratings success with Cleveland audiences, eventually re-positioning itself with a harder-edged classic rock format centered on local personalities. Cleveland native Walt Garrett joined the station in June 1987; under the name \"Mr. Classic\", Garrett hosted the \"Saturday Night Live House Party\" for 31 years (two of those years with Ron Sweed as co-host under his \"The Ghoul\" persona) until leaving in August 2018. Bill Louis, also a Cleveland native, took over as midday host on September 25, 1987, a time slot he still hosts; Louis was promoted to program director in December 1996.\n\nPaul Tapie continued on in morning drive, later paired with market veteran Bill Stallings as co-host, then with Mike Trivisonno as sportscaster; while a novice to broadcasting, Trivisonno had garnered notoriety in the market as \"Mr. Know-It-All,\" a regular caller to Pete Franklin's \"Sportsline\" on WWWE (1100 AM) throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Tapie left the station in April 1989; after WNCX posted several full-page ads advertising their morning-drive job opening, the position was filled with \"Those Guys in the Morning\": Rick Rydell and Todd Brandt, with Trivisonno continuing as sportscaster. Hired by then-PD Paul Ingles (at the suggestion of consultant Andy Bloom) from KMJK in Portland, Oregon, \"Those Guys\" had only marginal success in Cleveland, and were regularly criticized by the local paper, often speculating on their departure date from WNCX; Ingles himself was relieved of his program director duties and replaced by Doug Podell.\n\nFormer Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley signed on as evening host in December 1989, later hosting a one-hour program titled \"The British Invasion\". Local rock musician Michael Stanley then joined WNCX on September 17, 1990, to host a one-hour radio program entitled \"In the Heartland\"; the show eventually led to Stanley taking over the afternoon shift outright in May 1992, which he currently occupies. WNCX's next attempt in mornings also launched that September 17: \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\", co-hosted by Jerry Shirley and Paul Ingles, with holdover Mike Trivisonno. Ingles soon left, and was replaced on the show by Skip Herman; Paul Tapie even returned as a sidekick for the show within a few months of its debut.\n\nFollowing several months of rumors and competition from WENZ for the rights to the program, WNCX signed a deal in August 1992 to carry \"The Howard Stern Show\", based at WXRK (92.3 FM) in New York City, beginning that August 31; Skip Herman and Mike Trivisonno were dismissed, and Jerry Shirley was reassigned to the overnight shift. Then-program director Doug Podell had worked with Howard Stern in the early 1980s at rock station WWWW (106.7 FM) in Detroit prior to its switch to a country format (an event depicted in Stern's autobiographical film \"Private Parts\"). Andy Bloom, the same programming consultant who convinced Paul Ingles to hire \"Those Guys in the Morning\", was brought back to consult on the Stern start-up, as he had been the program director at WYSP in Philadelphia and KLSX in Los Angeles when both picked up Stern's show; Bloom would do the same for future affiliates as well. WNCX in Cleveland was just the sixth station (and the fifth affiliate after Stern's flagship WXRK) out of more than 60 nationally to carry \"The Howard Stern Show\".\nAmong the most notorious Howard Stern programs/broadcasts occurred in Cleveland on June 10, 1994. Having taken his radio show from Arbitron ranked #13 to #1 among all radio listeners in less than two years, Stern promised to have a street party and to broadcast a \"funeral\" for his competition live from the streets of Cleveland. During this now infamous broadcast, an engineer from WMMS snipped a broadcast wire that was used to feed the satellite uplink for the program, the engineer was subsequently caught, arrested and prosecuted.\n\nStern continued on with the program over a phone line as engineers quickly patched the broadcast wire back together:\n\nWNCX enjoyed a great deal of success with the Stern show for the next thirteen years. In October 2004, Stern announced that he would be leave terrestrial radio and move his radio program to Sirius Satellite Radio, a subscription radio service where he could avoid the content restrictions being forced on to him by the FCC. His final live broadcast aired on WNCX on December 16, 2005; program director Bill Louis reflected on the show's run, days after Stern's final broadcast: \"It's difficult to imagine the mornings without him... what [Stern] brought was a very specialized and special form of entertainment that no one is ever going to duplicate.\"\n\nMetroplex Communications merged into San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications in a combined $54 million deal announced on October 1993, this included WNCX and WERE; Clear Channel would then take control of WENZ's sales operations in March 1994 via a joint sales agreement, eventually buying the station outright in 1996. Following passage of the Telecom Act of 1996, Clear Channel announced a $4.4 billion merger with Jacor Communications in 1998; to comply with federal ownership guidelines, Clear Channel sold off WNCX to Infinity Broadcasting, while WERE and WENZ were sold to Radio One.\n\nIn the wake of Stern's departure, CBS Radio (the renamed Infinity Broadcasting) launched a hot talk format titled Free FM; while WNCX did not adopt this brand or format, it did sign up for one of the regionally syndicated morning shows CBS offered under the banner: \"The David Lee Roth Show\", hosted by musician David Lee Roth, which premiered on January 3, 2006. Due to very low ratings nationally and critical drubbings in the press, Roth's show was canceled on April 21; WNCX opted for a rotation of local hosts in the timeslot before hiring Mud (Wynn Richards), Kim Mihalik and newscaster Mike Olszewski in July 2006. Mud left the station in July 2008 and was replaced by Scott Miller; Kim Mihalik was dropped from the show that October; and Olszewski was replaced by local stand-up comedian Jeff Blanchard in April 2009.\n\nOn October 27, 2010, WNCX announced the hiring of Maxwell (Ben Bornstein)—formerly of WMMS—as host of \"The Maxwell Show\", replacing both Scott Miller and Jeff Blanchard, along with producer Dave Jockers; Jockers had been the local producer for \"The Howard Stern Show\" and all subsequent morning shows, in addition to having been the station's assistant program director and music director from 1996 onward. Regarding their dismissal, program director Bill Louis commented, \"sadly, this a bottom-line business.\" \"The Maxwell Show\" was cancelled on August 25, 2011; local media speculated that, in addition to \"flagging ratings,\" the show was cancelled to make room for \"a new, high-profile, multi-person morning show\" at sister station WKRK-FM (92.3 FM) as that station transitioned to a sports format. Local personality Slats (Tim Guinane), previously heard on WMMS and WXTM (WKRK-FM's predecessor), took over as morning host that November 7, where he remains to this day.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nLocal personality Slats (Tim Guinane) hosts the weekday morning show; WNCX personalities Bill Louis, Michael Stanley, and Paula Balish host the midday, afternoon, and evening shifts, respectively. Weekend programming includes: \"The Beatle Years\", hosted by Bob Malik (via Westwood One); \"The All Request Saturday Night\", hosted by WNCX personality Kenny Kidd; \"Time Warp\", hosted by Bill St. James (via United Stations Radio Networks); and \"Little Steven's Underground Garage,\" hosted by Steven Van Zandt (also via United Stations Radio Networks). The HD2 digital subchannel also broadcasts a classic rock format under the brand \"The Album Pod\".\n\nGeorge Lowe, perhaps best known as the voice of Space Ghost from \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\", provides station imaging for WNCX.\n\nAs of May 1, 2013, WNCX is a co-flagship station for the Cleveland Browns Radio Network, sharing coverage with sister station WKRK-FM, as well as AM sports station WKNR.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104249", "title": "Sulim Yamadayev", "text": "Sulim Yamadayev\n\nSulim Bekmirzayevich Yamadayev (; 21 June 1973 – 30 March 2009) was a Chechen rebel commander from the First Chechen War who had switched sides together with his brothers Dzhabrail, Badrudi, Isa and Ruslan in 1999 during the outbreak of the Second Chechen War. He was \"de facto\" commander of the Russian military Special Battalion Vostok unit belonging to the GRU. As such, until 2008, he was officially in command of the biggest pro-Moscow militia outside the control of the current Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov. From 1 to 22 August 2008 Yamadayev was wanted in Russia on a federal warrant. Nevertheless, he served as one of the Russian military commanders in Russia's war with Georgia during the same period.\n\nOn 5 March 2003, Sulim's brother Dzhabrail Yamadayev was assassinated by a bomb. On 24 September 2008 Sulim's brother Ruslan Yamadayev was shot dead on Smolenskaya Embankment in Moscow. Initial press responses reported name of the victim as \"Sulim Yamadayev\"; the name was corrected later. Sulim Yamadayev was shot in Dubai on 28 March 2009, and died in hospital on 30 March 2009.\n\nYamadayev studied business in Moscow before returning to Chechnya. He once said that his dream was to become a fighter and that during a time he decided to go to Afghanistan to train. Under the Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov, he served as a field commander and commanded a special forces detachment which routed a radical Wahhabi militia at Gudermes in 1998.\n\nDuring the Second Chechen War, the Yamadayevs and Akhmad Kadyrov arranged for their stronghold of Gudermes to be taken over by federal forces without a fight. Later, Sulim became leader of the GRU Spetsnaz unit called the Special Battalion Vostok (\"East\") of nearly 600 men, succeeding his brother Dzhabrail Yamadayev following his assassination in 2003. While working closely with the General of the Army Alexey Maslov, Sulim Yamadayev received the medal and title of Hero of the Russian Federation after his Vostok battalion killed the commander of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya, Abu al-Walid, in April 2004. Together with his paramilitary soldiers known within Chechnya as \"Yamadayevtsy\", which are alleged to be unruly and prone to mix warfare with crime, Yamadayev often conflicted with Ramzan Kadyrov (the son of Akhmad) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev over who controls overall military authority in Chechnya. Isa and Badrudi, the younger brothers of Sulim, became the company commanding officers in the battalion.\n\nOn 14 April 2008, the forces loyal to Yamadayev and Ramzan Kadyrov engaged in one of the biggest battles between rival Chechen factions. The clash occurred when convoys from each group ran into each other in Gudermes and reportedly resulted in around 18 dead. A bitter conflict between the men loyal to Yamadayev and forces of Kadyrov followed. In this conflict, Kadyrov prevailed and eventually Yamadayev was sacked from his post and declared a wanted \"criminal\" in Chechnya. On 6 August, the previous 'Hero of Russia' Yamadayev and some of his commandos were put on a federal wanted list. According to his brother and Duma deputy Ruslan Yamadayev, Sulim still allegedly lived in Moscow and did not hide at the time of the warrant being issued. The other Yamadayev brother, Badrudi was placed on the federal wanted list earlier in 2008. According to Moscow-based defence analyst Pavel Felgenhauer, \"It's important because this had been a rare challenge to Kadyrov in Chechnya. Now, it's clear that Yamadayev has been quashed and Kadyrov controls Chechnya.\"\n\nA few days after he was declared wanted in Russia, \"Gazeta\" reported that Yamadayev was participating in military actions in the outskirts of Tskhinvali in the Georgia's breakaway Republic of South Ossetia. \"Novaya Gazeta\" military correspondent Arkady Babchenko accompanied Yamadayev and his remaining loyal men in Georgia. Following the war, on 22 August, \"RIA Novosti\" reported Yamadayev was officially dismissed from his post as commander of the Vostok battalion in Chechnya. On the same day, the search for Yamadayev was stopped, officially because the Chechen MVD had established his whereabouts (according to investigatory bodies, Yamadayev was in Moscow).\n\nOn 24 September 2008, Ruslan Yamadayev and a retired Russian army General Sergey Kizyun (protector of the Yamadayev clan) were shot in Sulim's car in the central Moscow while driving from the Kremlin; Ruslan Yamadayev was fatally wounded. Initial press responses reported the name of the victim as \"Sulim Yamadayev\"; this was corrected later. Sulim Yamadayev blamed Kadyrov and vowed to avenge the death of his brother.\n\nOn 29 March 2009, Sulim Yamadayev was reported to be the victim of an assassination in Dubai, where he lived for several months as Suleiman Yamadayev and/or Suleyman Madov; his two bodyguards said he was shot in the back of the neck in an underground garage. The police attempted to detain a Russian citizen in connection with the attack, but the suspect was able to flee. However, despite the early reports of death, according to his younger brother, Isa, Yamadayev survived at least three gunshot wounds and was hospitalized in critical condition. According to RIAN, Yamadayev was placed in a military hospital after surviving an assassination attempt: he reportedly returned fire on his attackers, which \"saved his life.\" Dubai police dismissed this, reporting that Yamadayev died instantly from wounds sustained during the shooting. The Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed, on 1 April that Yamadayev had been buried in the Gulf state.\n\nOn 5 April 2009, the Dubai police accused Adam Delimkhanov of ordering the assassination. Delimkhanov is a member of the Russian State Duma for the United Russia party and Kadyrov's cousin and a close associate. He denied the accusation, saying it was \"a provocation and an attempt to destabilize conditions in the Chechen Republic.\" Later, the Interpol has issued arrest warrants for seven Russian citizens in connection with the killing. Besides Delimkhanov, Zelimkhan Mazayev, Elimpasha Khatsuyev, Salman Kimayev, Tirpal Kimayev, Ramazan Musiev and Marvan Kimayev were named as being wanted for \"crimes against life and health\".\n\n\nAccording to the Russian human rights organization Memorial in August 2008, \"Now we know from evidences of eyewitnesses that during the war in Georgia the fighters of the Vostok battalion were humanely treating the prisoners of war. As far as I understand, the Chechen battalion didn't take part in pogroms [of Georgians in Gori District], and everything incriminated to Yamadayev refers to the past.\"\n\n\n"}

These points can be redeemed in-store for grocery and other purchases.\n\nThe program is available to Loblaw supermarket affiliates.\n\nPC Plus launched as a digital loyalty program in May 2013.\n\nIn January 2017, an Ottawa man was arrested for fraud and money laundering for the redemption of points from stolen PC Plus accounts to purchase gift cards worth hundreds of dollars in value.\n\nOn February 1, 2018, the PC Plus program merged with Shoppers Drug Mart's similar Optimum program (Loblaw Companies had previously acquired the chain) to form PC Optimum. Users were instructed to transition their existing PC Plus and Optimum accounts online or do so in person and exchange their cards at Loblaw grocery or Shoppers Drug Mart locations. There were also several technical issues on-launch, including errors when creating an account on the PC Optimum app, the PC Optimum website being down for several hours, stores not giving out new cards, as well as some users' points not being transferred to the new service correctly. Loblaw acknowledged these difficulties, stating that they were aware \"that the transition has not been smooth for some\", and were working with customers to rectify them. As was the case before, only Shoppers Drug Mart locations will offer base points on purchases, at 15 points per dollar spent. \n\nSeveral glitches and errors were related to the launch of the PC Optimum program; such as difficulty in merging points, missing and stolen points, and several technical issues. According to a Loblaw financial report, the expenses associated with the creation of the PC Optimum brand was 189 million dollars.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Loblaw announced that Imperial Oil would switch to PC Optimum as the main loyalty program for its Esso-branded gas stations, ending a 14-year relationship with Aeroplan. PC Optimum is also accepted at the gas stations of sister brand Mobil, which launched in Canada as part of the 2017 acquisition of Loblaw's gas station network by Brookfield Business Partners. The partnership officially launched August 2018, with 10 points being awarded for every litre of gas and every dollar spent on other eligible purchases (including car washes and convenience store purchases).\n\nIn April 2019, Loblaw announced a trial program under which customers can receive free bonus points for opting into online behavioural advertising based on information associated with their PC Optimum accounts.\n\nCustomers earn points for purchasing specific weekly \"loaded offers\" (which are managed from the PC Optimum website and mobile app) based on purchasing habits, or through in-store promotions tied to specific purchases or coupons. PC Financial credit card users also earn points based on the dollar value of all purchases placed on the card through any retailer. The rate of point acquisition varies depending on which credit card is used, and whether or not the purchase made was at a Loblaw-affiliated store. For example, if a purchase was made at a participating Loblaw affiliate, then the stated rate is 10 points for every dollar spent on a PC Mastercard, 20 points per dollar on a PC World Mastercard and 30 points per dollar on a PC World Elite Mastercard. As 1000 PC Points are valued at $1, the minimum rate of return is 1%. Promotions are sometimes used to give bonus points on specific products.\n\nPoints can be redeemed for free groceries or other rewards. Points may be redeemed once a customer has reached a total of 10,000 or more (1,000 points = 1). Customers must also have a second form of payment once points are redeemed (as customers can only use points in multiples of 10,000 and cannot be used to pay the tax). Points can not be redeemed for gift cards, alcohol, tobacco, lottery tickets, or prescription medication.\n\nAnnounced in November 2017 as a pilot program, PC Insiders is a $99 per year (or $9.99 per month) pilot program for PC Plus members. The program includes bonus points on diapers, infant formula, PC Organics products, Joe Fresh products, and on the Shoppers Drug Mart beauty website. In addition, subscribers receive free order pickup with PC Express, complimentary online shipping, and a PC Travel credit. In December 2018, the program exited its pilot phase and became available to all PC Optimum members.\n"}

He was named a bishop on 3 December 1974 when he was appointed titular bishop of Siminina and auxiliary bishop of Suva; following his appointment as a bishop, he was consecrated the same year. On 10 April 1976, he was appointed archbishop of Suva. On 19 December 2012, his resignation was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI. He died on 30 June 2014 at the Suva Private Hospital after a long illness.\n\nMataca was a critic of some government policies, including its proposal to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission with the power, subject to presidential approval, to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état that deposed the elected government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry in 2000. \nOn 22 June 2005, Mataca accused Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase of having misled church leaders about the provisions of the legislation to establish the Commission. Mataca and the leaders of a number of other denominations, he said, had been summoned to the Prime Minister's office on 2 May where they had been told about the bill's reconciliation and compensation provisions, which they had heartily endorsed. Only later, through the media, did they learn about its amnesty provisions. \nMataca said he did not support the concept of amnesty for persons convicted of political crimes. The overthrow of a democratically elected government a serious crime, he said, and \"the coup cycle\" would continue unless those involved faced the consequences of their crimes. \"\"I publicly appeal to our President, our Prime Minister and the members of our Government to withdraw the Bill until such time as proper consultations can be held and appropriate amendments made,\"\" Mataca said. Reconciliation and unity could not come from a politically motivated bill, he warned. On the contrary, he saw reconciliation as a healing process that must start with truth telling, confession of wrongdoing, genuine request for forgiveness and willingness to accept the consequences of one's actions. \"It seems ... that the Bill has been hastily put together for political purposes - especially in view of the elections next year,\" Mataca said. \"This is not in the interests of the country and any stubborn effort by the Government to push through this Bill will be counter productive and will threaten Fiji's future stability.\" \nNot all Catholics agreed with Mataca. In a parliamentary submission on 30 June, Vice-President Kelepi Lesi of the Catholic League described the bill as a healing process between two parties, and very much in line with the moral principles taught by the Catholic Church.\n\nIn an article written for the Fiji Sun on 12 January 2006, Mataca condemned voices, who claimed to be Christian, who advocated proclaiming Fiji a Christian state, banning other religions, condemning homosexuality, and requiring leadership positions to be reserved for approved Christians. He called for what he called \"authentic Christian voices\" to speak up, and for the true path of Jesus to be followed. \nWriting an editorial in the Fiji Sun on 6 March 2006, Mataca called on Christians to avoid getting caught up in ethnic politics in the upcoming election due on 6–13 May, and said that calls for Christians to mobilize politically against others was contrary to the teaching and example of Jesus.\n\n \nIn the wake of the military coup which deposed the civilian government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase on 5 December 2006, Mataca took a more nuanced position than the leaders of many other denominations, and refused to endorse a statement put out by the Assembly of Christian Churches (ACCF) and the Fiji Council of Churches (FCC), which described the Fijian Military, commanded by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, as \"manifestations of darkness and evil.\" Mataca said that such a stance was hypocritical, as the organizations had failed to condemn the previous coup of 2000. In a letter to the Fiji Sun on 10 December, he condemned the coup, but also claimed that the government had pursued policies that had led to it. Part of this statement was quoted in Fiji Village on 12 December.\n\nMataca was co-chairman, along with Commodore Bainimarama, of the National Council for Building a Better Fiji.\n\nOn 6 January 2006, the Fiji Sun quoted Mataca as calling on people to \"respect, protect, and preserve\" family values. He condemned Fiji's high divorce rate, and criticized legislation which facilitated it.\n\nMataca died at the Suva Private Hospital after a long illness on 30 June 2014.<ref name=\"http://www.fbc.com\"></ref>\n"}

It marked a revival of the Rapide model name which had been used by Lagonda during the 1930s. The car was styled by Touring of Milan and featured rear-end styling similar to the DB4 convertible, and an adapted Lagonda grille a little similar to Ford's Edsel.\n\nThe Rapide uses a 4.0 L straight-6 six cylinder double overhead camshaft engine, which would later be used in the Aston Martin DB5. Other new features included a de Dion tube rear suspension which would find its way into the Aston Martin DBS.\n\nThe car has dual-circuit, servo-assisted, four-wheel disc brakes, and most cars were supplied with a 3-speed automatic BorgWarner gearbox. The exterior body panels were constructed from aluminium alloy over a Superleggera tubular steel frame. All cars except for the prototype had their bodies constructed by Lagonda.

{"id": "2104296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104296", "title": "Requiem for a Heavyweight", "text": "Requiem for a Heavyweight\n\nRequiem for a Heavyweight was a teleplay written by Rod Serling and produced for the live television show \"Playhouse 90\" on 11 October 1956. Six years later, it was adapted as a 1962 feature film starring Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney.\n\nThe teleplay won a Peabody Award, the first given to an individual script in television, and helped establish Serling's reputation. The broadcast was directed by Ralph Nelson and is generally considered one of the finest examples of live television drama in the United States, as well as being Serling's personal favorite of his own work. Nelson and Serling won Emmy Awards for their work.\n\nJack Palance portrays Harlan \"Mountain\" McClintock, a once-promising but now washed-up boxer who faces the end of his career after he is savagely defeated by a younger boxer. Keenan Wynn portrays McClintock's manager Maish; Keenan's father Ed plays McClintock's cut man, Army.\n\nMcClintock is suffering from Dementia pugilistica or \"punch drunk syndrome\"—brain damage caused by his career. A fight doctor refuses to certify McClintock for further boxing, saying that another rough match could blind or even kill him. Boxing is all McClintock has ever known, and he's both terrified of trying something new, and intensely loyal to Maish, who has nurtured him from his youth. Maish has troubles of his own, however: he owes money to the Mafia and tried to raise funds by betting that McClintock would be knocked out early (instead, by gamely and bravely taking a beating and refusing to go down, McClintock cost Maish a fortune).\n\nKim Hunter portrayed Grace Carney, an employment agency worker who tries to help the boxer make a transition to a new career. Maish persuades the boxer to turn to professional wrestling, though McClintock is proud that he never had a fixed fight and is uncomfortable with the staged, predetermined wrestling match.\n\nArmy disapproves of Maish's plans and refuses to be a part of them. Just before he is scheduled to go into the wrestling ring in a humiliating mountain man costume, McClintock learns of Maish's betting against him, and parts ways with his manager and mentor. Though he feels that boxing can ruin men's lives, Maish finds another promising young boxer to train. McClintock takes a chance on working with children at summer camp.\n\nBecause Serling and Palance were both experienced boxers, they brought a level of authenticity to \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\", although there was very little boxing depicted in the broadcast. \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" was the beginning of what became one of the new medium's most successful creative teams, writer Rod Serling and director Ralph Nelson.\n\n\nBBC Television in the United Kingdom screened a version of the play, retitled \"Blood Money\", in their regular \"Sunday Night Theatre\" anthology strand on March 31, 1957. Sean Connery, five years before portraying James Bond, starred as McClintock, while Alvin Rakoff produced and, with Serling's approval, also wrote some new material to cover costume changes that took place during commercial breaks on US television, but could not do so on the non-commercial BBC. Co-starring with Connery were Warren Mitchell and Rakoff's future wife Jacqueline Hill, who had recommended Connery for the leading part. Michael Caine was featured in a small role in a new scene written by Rakoff.\n\nThis production was reviewed in \"The Times\" newspaper the following day, which gave it a generally positive assessment, with some reservations. \"It is unfortunate that Mr. Serling has allowed a saccharine romance to intrude into this self-sufficient and wholly masculine situation. Otherwise his touch is sure. Although physically miscast as the fighter, Mr. Sean Connery played with a shambling and inarticulate charm that almost made the love affair credible.\" This version has not survived, although the discovery of a complete recording of the soundtrack was announced in 2014. It had been in possession of Rakoff, who had made a recording at the time of transmission for posterity.\n\nIn 1959 Dutch television adapted the story as \"Requiem voor een zwaargewicht\".\n\n\nIn 1974 Radio Television Belgrade adapted the story as \"Rekvijem za teškaša\".\n\n\nRalph Nelson also directed a film version in 1962 with Anthony Quinn in the role originated by Jack Palance, Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney in the parts portrayed on television by Keenan Wynn and his father Ed Wynn, and social worker Grace Miller was portrayed by Julie Harris.\n\nCassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, appears as Quinn's opponent in a boxing match at the beginning of the movie, a memorable sequence filmed with the camera providing Quinn's point of view as the unstoppable Clay rapidly punches directly at the movie audience. Afterward, Maish (Gleason) is confronted by bookies who threaten his life if he fails to repay the bet he just lost on the fight.\n\nThe film version is somewhat darker in its plotline than the original teleplay. Mountain Rivera (Quinn) is to interview for a counselor position at a children's camp, arranged by Grace Miller, but Maish, hoping that Mountain will forget about the job interview, takes him to a bar, where they both get drunk. Army (Rooney) arrives at the bar to remind Mountain about the appointment, but Rivera embarrasses himself at the hotel where the interview is to take place, behaving drunkenly in plain sight of the camp owners. After this episode, Grace confronts Maish in tears, condemning him for controlling Mountain and ruining his chance to make a new life for himself.\n\nIn the film version, Maish responds forcefully and eloquently to Grace Miller's accusation that he's been over-controlling of Rivera, cares nothing for him, for his best interest or for his future. He tells Grace that she must stop daydreaming and recognize that her idealized conception of Louis Rivera is as false and damaging to Rivera as is Maish's alleged mediocre management of Rivera's pro boxing career, and that her so-called \"vision\" for Rivera's post-boxing future as a counselor at a children's summer camp is as naïve and pathetic as it is improbable.\n\nTo pay off Maish's gambling debts, Mountain agrees to perform as Native American wrestling persona \"Big Chief Mountain Rivera.\" Just prior to entering the ring for his first match, an overwhelming tide of humiliation sweeps over Mountain, causing him to change his mind. Maish blurts out that he bet against Mountain in the fight against Clay, and as Rivera attempts to leave the locker room, \"Ma\" Greeny and her thugs enter, threatening Maish. However, Mountain changes his mind and agrees to wrestle, thereby allowing \"Ma\" to be paid and saving Maish's life. In the epic final scene of the film, Mountain enters the ring amidst jeering ridicule to face \"Haystacks Calhoun,\" a grappler from Arkansas billed at 601 lbs.\n\n\nIn 1985, it was adapted into a short-lived Broadway version at the Martin Beck Theatre starring John Lithgow as Harlan and George Segal as Maish.\n\nIn 1960, Ralph Nelson wrote and directed \"The Man in the Funny Suit\", a dramatic account of Keenan Wynn's travails in helping his father, comedian Ed Wynn, play such a serious role on live television in \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\".\n\n\n"}

It also marked the edge of Windsor Forest before the forest was cut down to build towns. Chertsey is the adjoining town, in which it was historically included, and Addlestone railway station is on the Chertsey Branch Line. It is also home to parts of St George's College, Weybridge.\n\nAddlestone is a town, southwest of London and north-by-northeast Guildford; the town constitutes the administrative centre of the borough of Runnymede of which it is the largest settlement.\n\nNarrow green buffers separate the town of Weybridge and town of Chertsey and a larger green buffer including a farm, M25 and a golf course separates the village of Ottershaw. No fixed southern boundary with New Haw exists which has had signs at various points but not on all approaches\n\nAfter the 2001 census the place was approximatively interpreted by the county council as home to 16,657 residents in 7,281 homes, whereas neighbouring Chertsey was interpreted as having 11,766 inhabitants, Egham having 11,179 inhabitants (excluding Egham Hythe) and Englefield Green 11,180 inhabitants, prompting a publication by the district council that is not only the administrative town of Runnymede but also making a case that it is, narrowly, the largest single settlement.\n\nThe population of the two wards Addlestone North and Addlestone Bournside was 11,501 in 2011. Populations of associated wards, New Haw and 'Chertsey South and Row Town' (mainly Row Town) were 5,757 and 5,328 respectively.\n\nThe four wards have their own semi-permanent (land use) profiles: Addlestone Bourneside has the greatest proportion of privately rented homes, Addlestone North that of socially rented homes. Housing in Chertsey South and Row Town which is mostly Row Town was, in 2011, 86% owner-occupied with or without a loan, the third highest proportion in Runnymede. Offices and factories are below the local averages for areas within the M25 – the most common land use being parks, playing fields, flood meadows/woodland, farms and golf courses in the form of Green Belt buffer land mentioned. The M25 motorway accounts for the relatively large proportion of land devoted to roads for the density of population and housing.\n\nThe name Addlestone probably means \"Attel's Denu\": the valley belonging to a Saxon named Attel.\n\nAddlestone, historically called Atlesdon or Atlesford, was a part of Chertsey ecclesiastical parish, the basic unit of civil administration.\n\nIn 1241 the place was listed as \"Attelsdene\" and by 1610 John Speed's map shows \"Adleston\", halfway between named hills St. Annhill and St. Georg Hill, just south of the Thames.\n\nThe \"Crouch Oak\", an oak tree believed to have originated in the 11th Century, is an important symbol of the town. It used to mark the boundary of Windsor Great Park. Legend says that Queen Elizabeth I stopped by it and had a picnic. The tree is one of the main historic features of the town, and consequently several local businesses use its name in their title. It survived an arson attack in September 2007.\n\nOngar Hill, in the 18th century a country house and farm now smaller homes and motorway, belonged to Vice-Admiral Sir Hyde Parker the elder (d. 1782) instrumental in the Seven Years' War against Spanish interests in India and the Philippines and in the American War of Independence involved with action containing French forces based in Martinique.\n\nSayes Court, Addlestone, now a junior school and residential estate before demolition was a country house of a family named Moore from the 17th to the end of the 18th century. In 1823 it became the property of Sir Charles Wetherell, Recorder (judge) of Bristol, who had it rebuilt or at least considerably altered.\nAddlestone, including St George's College's grounds of Woburn Park and the remaining farms and water meadows designated Green Belt were the western strip of Chertsey Manor or Chertsey Beomond Manor (to distinguish it from others), possessed by Chertsey Abbey from the grant of land by Frithwald, \"subregulus\" of Surrey, at a date between the years 666 and 675 CE until the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\nAdam de Woburn lived at Woburn Park in 1260\n\nOnly thirteen years after 1537 the Crown was content to lease the land rather than continue with a steward (office) so Sir William Fitz William (later his widow) held the whole Chertsey Beomond manor from 1550–1574; later Sir Francis Bacon held it for the infant Charles I who granted it specifically for his Queen, Henrietta Maria (of France). During the Commonwealth of England, the government sold the manor to William Aspinall who sold 292 trees of Birch Wood there for the Navy; however taken back by the Crown at the Restoration of the monarchy and the first of many leases was granted; the first lease was to the first Lord Holles. For example, from 1779–1803 the Duke of Bridgwater held it and from an unknown date until 1827 the British Commander-in-Chief Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, famed for the nursery rhyme and the Duke of York Column by St James's Palace and Carlton Terrace was tenant of the lands.\n\nIn the 1740s, the famed gardener, Philip Southcote, chose to construct a two-storey house. Now a Grade II listed building, it was also named Woburn Park, with an original ornamented farm (\"ferme ornée\") on Woburn Hill with fields for cattle or crops, decorated with statues, grotto, vases, temples, archways and other features, much of which survives as part of St George's College. The subsequent owners of Woburn Park were:\n\nChertsey poor law union's workhouse was in Addlestone and was built in 1836–8. Addlestone chapel was added in 1868. The Village Hall was built in 1887 by the Addlestone Village Hall Company. The Princess Mary Village Homes at Addlestone were established by the organisation and patronage of the Duchess of Teck (Princess Mary of Cambridge) in 1871: certified industrial schools for female children of prisoners, or children otherwise in a destitute or dangerous position. They were conducted on the separate homes system, and are supported by voluntary contributions, with a Treasury allowance for children committed under the Industrial Schools Act. Addlestone's schools were mostly founded in this period: St. Paul's Primary School, built 1841, enlarged 1851 and 1885, initially for girls and infants. Chertsey Urban District took over all roles of the parish and of the \"Godley Hundred\" under the Local Government Act 1894. A boys' school was added in 1901. New Ham School was built in 1874. St. Augustine's School (Church) for infants was built in 1882, and Chapel Park (a church-sponsored School) in 1896.\n\nA Baptist chapel was built in Addlestone in 1872, and a Wesleyan chapel in 1898. Another ecclesiastical district of Addlestone, though today separated now by the residential development of New Haw, called Woodham and closer to the major town of Woking was formed in 1902 on what were the boundaries of Chertsey parish and Horsell parish.\n\nBy 1911 the ecclesiastical district and ward Addlestone could be considered to have outstripped the original centre of the parish, Chertsey, in importance. According to the Victoria County History published in that year: This ward contains the largest number of people of the three wards [Chertsey, Addlestone, and Outer Ward] into which the Chertsey Urban District was divided, and the number of new houses shows the growing character of the neighbourhood.\n\nOn Station Road, a large Blériot aircraft factory was built in 1917; its several hundred aeroplanes were taken by road to Brooklands for final assembly and test flying. In the 1950s the site was taken over by Weymann to build buses and coaches who built the prototype of the AEC Routemaster bus ceasing trade in the mid-1960s. Caddy's acquired part of the site to manufacture taxis followed in 1967 by Plessey which moved from Chessington. In 1990, the site was used by Marconi. These companies were important local employers. By 2000 the site was derelict. The site was redeveloped in the early 2010s as a business park: Aviator Park.\n\nElevations range between and . The maximum is on Row Hill recreation ground, Row Town, Addlestone; a ridge that continues to the northwest of Row Town where it is known as Ongar/Spinney Hill, where Great Grove Farm in its centre also reaches this height; the minimum is by the Thames and along the Woburn Park Stream which is the main distributary of \"The Bourne\" the main waterway of the village, a stream rising as the \"Windle Brook\" in Windlesham cutting a shallow ravine, flowing past the McLaren Technology Centre and Woodham then passing to the east of the village.\n\nEminences of the Bagshot Sand stand out above the river most notably the western hills mentioned and Woburn Hill which is AOD compared to St Ann's Hill, Chertsey's , however, is part of the landscape critical to Woburn Park and the private gardens of Woburn Hill.\n\nMajor climate changes in Britain causing sea level changes in the last 2.58 million years, with mini Ice Ages, the ice sheets did not extend to Surrey but sand and gravel deposits swept towards the fledgling River Thames were spread in all lower parts. Gravel terraces at various heights on the valley sides are the remnants of successive floodplains, the highest terrace being the oldest and the lowest the youngest. The most prominent terraces mark the former levels of the Thames in north Surrey. Along tributary slopes, a deposit, head, forms the main sediment of latest age. Head comprises angular pieces of rock and soil derived locally from the extensive frost-shattering of rocks and the subsequent movement of this material down valley slopes.\n\nSoil is predominantly \"loamy soil with naturally high groundwater\". Woburn Hill has \"slowly permeable seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soil\". New Haw, the southern part of the Addlestone post town and historically a part has \"freely draining slightly acid loamy soils\"; so does Great Grove Farm. West of the M25 as far as the centre of Ottershaw is a belt of \"slightly acid loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage\" soil.\n\nThere are two secondary schools in Addlestone: Jubilee High School, state-funded and St George's College, independently funded which relocated from Croydon to Woburn Park in 1884. All non-junior parts of the school occupy Woburn Park, Addlestone described above.\n\nA range of primary and infant schools are in Addlestone which include St Paul's C of E Primary School, Ongar Place, Sayes Court, The Holy Family Catholic Primary School and Darley Dene infant school. A few nurseries also serve the wider-area community.\n\nHeading north from the town, towards the Addlestonemoor five-way, two-lane roundabout is a Grade II listed building at the renaming Brighton Road to Chertsey Road, the George Inn, almost opposite which are another listed building split into two houses: nos 114–116 Chertsey Road, early 19th century, slate-roofed houses with sash windows. This Inn is a Tudor Period building with 18th century and later alterations and has three gables facing the road.\n\nWoburn Hill is a large house built in 1815 spread over three storeys, that features a moulded cornice and fluted Greek Doric columns to its porch with an iron balustrade above it forming a balcony in front of a central window of the floor above.\n\nRow Hill forms a residential estate with shops of a butcher, baker and electrical appliance store that is contiguous with Addlestone to its west.\nThese shops are on Ongar Hill not Row Hill and hence the name Ongar Parade, also known locally as \"Top shops\" due to being at the top of Row Town.\n\nAddlestone Moor has a public house, now closed 08/2013, now a Day Nursery, flood meadows, a sports pitch and a mobile home park. It is also home to the Runnymede Rockets BMX Club. Its roundabout marks on the closer side of town has five exits and is used for motorway access from primarily Addlestone, Weybridge, Shepperton, Laleham and Chertsey.\n\nAbbey Rangers play at Addlestone Moor, on the Thames winter flood meadows (prior to the construction of the Thames Barrier) next to the disused Woburn Arms and the athletics track in Woburn Park which is now St George's RC College.\n\nThe now-defunct Addlestone & Weybridge Town were established as Addlestone Town in 1885 and played at their ground in Liberty Lane until their dissolution in 1985. There is now housing on the site of the club's ground.\n\nAddlestone Victory Park Bowls Club was formed in 1931 and has played at the facilities maintained by Runnymede Borough Council since then. The club offers both indoor and outdoor short mat bowling facilities to members of all ages and levels of experience.\n\nAddlestone is mentioned in H.G Wells' book \"The War of the Worlds\", in which the second of ten Martian invasion ships (called 'cylinders') lands at the Addlestone Golf Links. This is probably a reference to New Zealand Golf Club (founded 1895) on Woodham Lane - the road from Woking to Addlestone - and not the Abbey Moor Golf Course which was only established in 1989.\n\nAddlestone Library is co-located with Runnymede Borough Council and Addlestone Police in the Runnymede Civic Centre built in 2008 at a cost of £12,700,000 with atriums and courtyards on Station Road and opposite Addlestone Health Centre.\n\nIts main road is Station Road which has many shops, two supermarkets, Addlestone Methodist Church, a doctors' NHS surgery, the Aviator business park and the Eileen Tozer Day Centre; the civic centre of Runnymede borough council is on this street.\n\nStation Road hosts a 2011-completed business (office) estate, Aviator Park, in glass and steel which has landscaped verges with trees, shrubs and grass.\n\nIn July 2015, Bouygues Development commenced work on a new, large scale town centre regeneration called, \"Addlestone ONE\". Located along Station Road and next to Runnymede Civic Centre, when complete in 2017, the project will create 213 new homes, a Premier Inn hotel, a Waitrose supermarket, a premium 6-screen cinema operated by The Light Cinemas, new public spaces, various restaurants and shops as well as a multi-storey car park. The Ground Breaking Ceremony for the development took place on 23 October 2015 and was officiated by Foreign Secretary, the Rt. Hon. Philip Hammond.\n\nThe UK headquarters of multinational defence company Thales Group is located in the town.\n\nStation Road joins into surrounding A-roads in all directions, including non-principal \"Brighton Road\" which has since become superseded by the motorway network and other north-south roads, the A319 that links in towards routes to Berkshire and the A320 road that is convenient for closer areas of Thames Valley corridor, and the A318 to Brooklands with its museum, luxury hotel and retail park and the A3 road Painshill interchange between Hersham and Cobham towards London.\n\nAddlestone railway station is on the Chertsey Branch Line from Weybridge from where rapid national services can be caught on the South West Main Line. A journey time of 47 minutes to London Waterloo station with one change is achievable or 81 minutes with no changes via Staines upon Thames, Feltham, Hounslow, Chiswick and Putney.\n\nAddlestone has four principal bus services. An hourly service to Slough via Staines upon Thames and Windsor and in the other direction to the Brooklands retail park operates: bus 51:<br> Another service with 2 buses per hour is the 461 which goes from Chertsey to Kingston upon Thames and bus 446 between Woking and Staines upon Thames.\n\nThe Wey Navigation canal runs to the south east of the town.

She appeared in such movies as \"A Thousand Clowns\", \"Plaza Suite\", \"Nashville\", \"Family Plot\", \"Freaky Friday\", \"Peggy Sue Got Married\", and \"Grosse Pointe Blank\". Harris won a Tony Award and was nominated for an Academy Award. She also received four Golden Globe Award nominations.\n\nHarris was born in Evanston, Illinois, the daughter of Natalie (née Densmoor), a pianist, and Oscar Graham Harris, an arborist who later became a businessman. In her youth, Harris attended Wilbur Wright College. She began her stage career as a teenager at the Playwrights Theatre in Chicago. Her fellow players included Edward Asner, Elaine May and Mike Nichols.\n\nShe was also a member of the Compass Players, the first ongoing improvisational theatre troupe in the United States, directed by Paul Sills, to whom she was married at that time. Though the Compass Players closed in disarray, a second theatre directed by Sills called \"The Second City\" opened in Chicago in 1959 and attracted national attention. Despite Sills and Harris having divorced by this time, Sills cast her in this company and brought her to New York to play in a Broadway edition at the Royale Theatre, opening on September 26, 1961. She was nominated for the 1962 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance.\n\nA life member of the Actors Studio, Harris received a Tony Award nomination in 1962 for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical for her Broadway debut in the original musical revue production \"From the Second City\", which ran at the Royale Theatre from September 26, 1961 to December 9, 1961. The revue also featured the young Alan Arkin and Paul Sand. Produced by Max Liebman (among others) and directed by Paul Sills, the production presented Harris in such sketches as \"Caesar's Wife\", \"First Affair\", \"Museum Piece\", and \"The Bergman Film\".\n\nIn a 2002 interview with the \"Phoenix New Times\", Harris recalled her ambivalence about even bringing the troupe to New York from Chicago. She said, \"When I was at Second City, there was a vote about whether we should take our show to Broadway or not. Andrew Duncan and I voted no. I stayed in New York, but only because Richard Rodgers and Alan Jay Lerner came and said, 'We want to write a musical for you!' Well, I wasn't big on musical theater. I had seen part of \"South Pacific\" in Chicago and I walked out. But it was Richard Rodgers calling!\"\n\nWhile Rodgers and Lerner were busy working on their original musical for her, she won the Theatre World Award for her role in playwright Arthur Kopit's dark comedic farce, \"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad\". She earned a nomination for the 1966 Tony for Best Actress in a Musical for \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\" (1965), a Broadway musical created for her by Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane. She starred as Daisy Gamble, a New Yorker who seeks out the help of a psychiatrist to stop smoking. Under hypnosis, the apparently kooky, brash, and quirky character reveals unexpected hidden depths. During her hypnotic trances, she becomes fascinating to the psychiatrist as she reveals herself as a woman who has lived many past lives, one of them ending tragically. While critics were divided over the merits of the show, they praised Harris's performance. The show opened on October 14, 1965 at the Mark Hellinger Theater and ran for 280 performances, earning a total of three Tony nominations. Harris performed numbers from the show with John Cullum on \"The Bell Telephone Hour\" (\"The Lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner\", broadcast on February 27, 1966). She had previously appeared on Broadway with Anne Bancroft in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht's \"Mother Courage\", staged by Jerome Robbins, at the Martin Beck Theater; the production received five Tony Award nominations.\n\nHarris gave another well-received performance in \"The Apple Tree\", another Broadway musical created for her, this time by the team of composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick. The show, in which Harris co-starred with Alan Alda and Larry Blyden and was directed by Mike Nichols, opened at the Shubert Theater on October 5, 1966 and closed on November 25, 1967. The show was based on three tales by Mark Twain, Frank R. Stockton, and Jules Feiffer and Harris starred in all three. She played Eve in Twain's \"The Diary of Adam and Eve\", a melodramatically campy temptress in \"The Lady and the Tiger\", and two roles in Jules Feiffer's \"Passionella\". She was the forlorn, soot-stained nasal-congested chimney-sweep who wants only to be \"a beautiful glamorous movie star, for its own sake\", and, by virtue of an instantaneous costume-change, the huge-bosomed, gold-gowned, blonde bombshell of a movie star she always dreamed she'd be. Richard Watts Jr. of the \"New York Post\" wrote \"[t]here are many high triumphs of the imagination in the vastly original musical comedy ... [b]ut it is Miss Harris who provides it with the extra touch of magic.\" Walter Kerr called her \"the square root of noisy sex\" and \"sweetness carried well into infinity\". Harris captured the 1967 Tony for Best Actress in a Musical as well as \"Cue Magazine\"'s \"Entertainer of the Year\" award. Of her friend and colleague Mike Nichols, she said in 2002, \"Mike Nichols was a toughie. He could be very kind, but if you weren't first-rate, watch out. He'd let you know.\"\n\nHarris stopped appearing on stage after \"The Apple Tree\", except for the off-Broadway first American production of Brecht and Weill's \"Mahagonny\" in 1970, in which she played the role of Jenny, originally created by Lotte Lenya. In the 2002 interview, Harris said, \"Who wants to be up on the stage all the time? It isn't easy. You have to be awfully invested in the fame aspect, and I really never was. What I cared about was the discipline of acting, whether I did well or not.\"\n\nFrom 1961 through 1964, she appeared as a guest star on such popular television series as \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"Naked City\", \"Channing\" and \"The Defenders\". In 1965, she made an auspicious feature film debut as social worker Sandra Markowitz in the screen version of \"A Thousand Clowns\". She co-starred opposite Jason Robards Jr., who played the freewheeling, eternally optimistic guardian of his teenage nephew, the custody of whom is threatened by authorities' dim view of his bohemian lifestyle. \"The New York Times\" critic wrote on December 9, 1965 that the movie \"has the new and sensational Barbara Harris playing the appropriately light-headed girl\". Harris and Robards won Golden Globe nominations.\n\nIn Neil Simon's \"Plaza Suite\" with Walter Matthau, the British entertainment magazine \"Time Out\" called the \"delightful\" Harris' gifts \"wasted\". She had only slightly better opportunities in \"The War Between Men and Women\" with Jack Lemmon, and the screen version of Arthur Kopit's darkly comic \"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad\" with Rosalind Russell as the monstrous mother of Robert Morse who takes the stuffed corpse of her dead husband along on trips. Reviewing the latter film for \"The New York Times\" on February 16, 1967, critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \"Barbara Harris from the original play cast is as wacky as she was on the stage — casual and direct and totally blasé about the boisterous business of sex. Her tussle to accomplish her purpose, with the corpse falling out into the room every time she is about to score a field goal, is still the funniest scene.\"\n\nShe earned an Oscar nomination for the 1971 film (which co-starred Dustin Hoffman) \"Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?\", about a rich, successful, womanizing pop songwriter suffering a debilitating but oddly liberating mental crisis. The script was by Herb Gardner, who also wrote \"A Thousand Clowns\".\n\nIn 1975, Harris appeared in one of her signature film roles in Robert Altman's masterpiece \"Nashville\", playing Albuquerque, a ditzy, scantily clad country singing hopeful who may be far more opportunistic and calculating than she would first appear. Accounts of the film's chaotic and inspired production, particularly in Jan Stuart's book \"The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece\", indicate a clash between actress and director. Harris earned a Golden Globe nomination (one of 11 for the film); as Oscar-nominated co-star Lily Tomlin put it, \"I was the hugest of Barbara Harris fans; I thought she was so stunning and original.\" Although the two were set to reunite with Altman in a sequel, that film was never made.\n\nThe following year, Alfred Hitchcock cast her in \"Family Plot\" as a bogus spiritualist who searches for a missing heir and a family fortune with her cab driver boyfriend. Among a cast that included Bruce Dern, William Devane, and Karen Black, Hitchcock was particularly delighted by Harris' quirkiness, skill and intelligence. She received praise from critics as well as a Golden Globe nomination for the film, which was based on the novel \"The Rainbird Pattern\" by Victor Canning, and which marked a reunion of Hitchcock with Ernest Lehman, who had created the original screenplay for \"North by Northwest\". In her 2002 \"Phoenix New Times\" interview, she admitted that she \"turned down Alfred Hitchcock when he first asked me to be in one of his movies\". After agreeing to star in \"Family Plot\", she recalled that \"Hitchcock was a wonderful man.\" The film was Hitchcock's last and inasmuch as Harris appears by herself in its final shot (in which she winks at the audience), she has the distinction of being the actor who, so to speak, ended Alfred Hitchcock's long and illustrious career.\n\nHarris continued to appear in films of the 1970s-80s, including \"Freaky Friday\" with a young Jodie Foster, \"Movie Movie\" for director Stanley Donen, and \"The North Avenue Irregulars\" with Edward Herrmann and Cloris Leachman. She co-starred in \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" with one of her former Broadway leading men, Alan Alda (who also wrote the screenplay), a tale of a liberal Washington Senator caught in an affair with a younger woman, played by Meryl Streep.\n\nIn 1981, she starred in \"Second-Hand Hearts\" for esteemed director Hal Ashby as \"Dinette Dusty\", a recently widowed waitress and would-be singer who marries a boozy carwash worker named \"Loyal\", played by Robert Blake to get back her children from their paternal grandparents. The film, based on a highly sought-after \"road movie\" screenplay by Charles Eastman, was a disaster that tarnished the careers of all concerned. Critic Vincent Canby in his negative \"New York Times\" review on May 8, 1981 opined, \"[t]he film's one bright spot is Barbara Harris, who plays Dinette as sincerely as possible under awful conditions. She looks great even when she's supposed to be tacky, and is genuinely funny as she tries to make sense out of Loyal's muddled philosophizing, which, of course, the screenplay requires her to match.\" Harris was offscreen until 1986 when she played the mother of Kathleen Turner in \"Peggy Sue Got Married\". Her last films were \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" and \"Grosse Pointe Blank\".\n\nHarris retired from acting and began teaching. When asked in 2002 if she would resume her acting career, she said, \"Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for $10 million, I'd work again. But I haven't worked in a long time as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having to go out and do a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting.\"\n\nIn 2005, she briefly resurfaced, guest starring as The Queen and as Spunky Brandburn on \"Anne Manx on Amazonia\", an audio drama by the Radio Repertory Company of America, which aired on XM Satellite Radio.\n\nHarris died of lung cancer in Scottsdale, Arizona on August 21, 2018, aged 83.\n\n"}

The university has three campuses in central Rome. It was founded in 1972 as a small affiliate program with Hiram College, before becoming its own independent university in 1991 and earning accreditation in 2003. Until about 1991 it was known as John Cabot International College.\n\nThe college was founded in 1972 and originally located within a religious school called Pro Deo University.

The heliotrope was invented in 1821 by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. The word \"heliotrope\" is taken from the Greek: \"helios\" (), meaning \"sun\", and \"tropos\" (), meaning \"turn\". It is a fitting name for an instrument which can be used to \"turn\" incoming sunlight (via reflection).\n\nHeliotropes were used in surveys from Gauss's survey in Germany in 1821 through the late 1980s, when GPS measurements replaced the use of the heliotrope in long distance surveys. Colonel Sir George Everest introduced the use of heliotropes into the Great Trigonometric Survey in India around 1831, and the US Coast and Geographic Survey used heliotropes to survey the United States. The Indian specification for heliotropes was updated in 1981, and the American military specification for heliotropes (MIL-H-20194E) was retired on 8 December 1995.\n\nSurveyors used the heliotrope as a specialized form of survey target; it was employed during large triangulation surveys where, because of the great distance between stations (usually twenty miles or more), a regular target would be indistinct or invisible. Heliotropes were often used as survey targets at ranges of over 100 miles. In California, in 1878, a heliotrope on Mount Saint Helena was surveyed by B.A. Colonna of the USCGS from Mount Shasta, a distance of 192 miles (309 km).\n\nThe heliotrope was limited to use on sunny days and was further limited (in regions of high temperatures) to mornings and afternoons when atmospheric aberration least affected the instrument-man's line of sight. The heliotrope operator was called a \"heliotroper\" or \"flasher\" and would sometimes employ a second mirror for communicating with the instrument station through heliography, a signalling system using impulsed reflecting surfaces. The inventor of the heliograph, a similar instrument specialized for signaling, was inspired by observing the use of heliotropes in the survey of India.\n\n\n"}

These were two coke-fired furnaces built in 1868 by Cumberland Coal and Iron. There was a source of carbonate iron ore on the hill to the northeast, tapped by a tram road. Limestone was available from a hill to the east. The furnaces produced pig iron, and operated from 1874 to 1880. The pig iron was shipped by rail on the C&P via a spur line off the main. The product went to Cumberland.\n\nFrom Midlothian Junction, the C&P made a connection with a logging railroad. The Juniata Lumber Company established a circular sawmill in Midlothian, at the end of a 3-foot gauge line that extended 12 miles into Garrett County along Big Savage Mountain.

Along with Jonathan Tweet, he is also one of the original two designers of \"Ars Magica\".\n\nIn 1987, Rein-Hagen and Jonathan Tweet founded game publisher Lion Rampant while students at Saint Olaf College; there they met Lisa Stevens who later joined the company. Rein-Hagen and Tweet designed \"Ars Magica\" over a period of nine months, publishing it in 1987. Lion Rampant encountered financial difficulties in 1990, but after Stevens pitched the idea of a merger to Rein-Hagen and Stewart Wieck, they decided to merge White Wolf and Lion Rampant forming a new company White Wolf Game Studio, with the two as co-owners. Of his experience at Lion Rampant, Rein-Hagen recalls; \nWhile Rein-Hagen was on the road with Wieck and Stevens to GenCon 23 in 1990, he conceived of the game \"\" which became his main project for the next year, and was published by the new company in 1991. Next year (1992) Rein-Hagen wrote (with Robert Hatch and Bill Bridges) \"\" which was published through White Wolf.\n\"\" (1993) was based to a certain extent on a game that Rein-Hagen had imagined back in 1989 as something like a modern-day \"Ars Magica\", although this was the first World of Darkness game in which he was not explicitly involved.\n\"\" (1994) marked his return to the design of the core games in the World of Darkness setting. Rein-Hagen was developing a science-fiction game called \"Exile\" to be published in 1997, which was to be owned by a non-profit called the Null Foundation. However, White Wolf encountered financial difficulties in 1995–1996, which caused a falling out between Rein-Hagen and Wieck and his brother Steve Wieck. As a result, Rein-Hagen left White Wolf taking \"Exile\" with him. His Null Foundation put out a playtest draft of \"Exile\" in 1997, but the game was never fully published.\n\nHe served as a writer and producer for \"\", a 1996 TV show loosely based on \"Vampire\", produced by Aaron Spelling and shown on Fox TV. He was unhappy with the finished product because FOX's producers had a vision for the series he did not share. “The show wasn’t as good as it could have been, if they only had listened to me more.” \"Kindred\" was cancelled after eight episodes, however, following the death of its star Mark Frankel any attempts to revive it were abandoned. Rein-Hagen continued to work in Hollywood for four years total, but disillusioned and fed up trying to make it as a writer, he decided to leave it behind. “It was the goal of my life, but finally I just left”.\n\nHe founded the company Atomaton, Inc. a few years later, which produced his game \"Z-G\" in 2001; Atomaton ceased operation in 2003.\n\nRein-Hagen published Whimsy Cards, \"Ars Magica\", and major \"Ars Magica\" supplements through Lion Rampant with Jonathan Tweet. Tweet and Rein-Hagen worked with Stevens, John Nephew, and others who would become hobby game professionals.\n\nRein-Hagen, along with Ray Winninger and Stewart Wieck, made major contributions to \"D.O.A.\", designed by Greg Gorden of Mayfair Games in conjunction with White Wolf, but the game was never published. It was based on a concept called \"Inferno\" that Rein-Hagen had worked on previously for many years at Lion Rampant, wherein players took on the roles of dead characters from old campaigns.\n\nRein-Hagen sold his shares in White Wolf in 2007 and left the gaming field. As of mid-2008 he was living in Tbilisi, Georgia, with his wife and child during the Russo-Georgian War (2008 South Ossetia War). Rein-Hagen was evacuated with other US citizens living in Georgia and founded the site sosgeorgia.org (now defunct) to help the international media track what was happening there. He returned to Georgia after the war.\n\nIn 2012 Rein-Hagen worked on a card game called \"Democracy\" for his company Make Believe Games. This game was successfully funded by Kickstarter in November 2012. As of December 3, 2014, over two years after funding, fulfillment is largely complete. On February 4, 2014 Rein-Hagen released a statement citing poor health as the reason for his lack of communication and promising that backers would get their game. Commentators were extremely unhappy with the tone of the message and complained that Rein-Hagen's ill health had not affected his ability to work on other crowd-funded projects. The game Democracy shipped on November 18, 2014.\n\nIn a YouTube interview, Rein-Hagen spoke fondly of his former work on role-playing games and how he is working on a new role-playing game. Rein-Hagen elaborated on this role-playing game in March 2013, in another YouTube interview, describing some of the mechanics and speculating on a release date without naming it. In addition he discussed his new game \"Succubus: The Reborn\". \"Succubus: The Reborn\" had a kickstarter through Make-Believe Games that started on March 18, 2013 and failed to be funded on April 19, 2013.\n\nThe result of a June 2013 Kickstarter campaign, a horror RPG entitled \"I Am Zombie\" was released in 2015.\n\nIn May 2016 a new RPG game, Toxicity, was successfully funded on Kickstarter, and a new project was announced, HAIL CTHULHU! which is based on a license from Chaosium and depicts Lovecraft's mythos from the cultist and monster point of view.\n\nAuthor\n\n\nAuthor\n\nAdditional Design\n\nAdditional Material\n\nDesign\n\nDeveloper\n\nOriginal Concept and Design\n"}

For many years the Chapel Street location was the target of repeated terrorist attacks by anti-Castro groups based in the United States. The first of these was an improvised bomb made out of bazooka shells that went off on September 22 1966. It caused only minor damage to the embassy. The bomb blew out the embassy's windows, and those of many nearby homes and made a crater in the sidewalk. In 1968 the embassy moved into a stone manor at 700 Echo Drive in Old Ottawa South, which was the site of another unsuccessful attack in 1974. It moved to its present heavily fortified location in 1977.\n\nThis bombing campaign would continue until 1980 with the embassy and the Cuban consulate in Montreal being repeatedly attacked.

He is primarily known for his work in the horror and thriller film genres, having worked with writers and directors such as Shane Black, William Peter Blatty, John Carpenter, Fred Dekker, Richard Donner, Stephen King, and George A. Romero. He is also a familiar face to mainstream viewers, often playing police officers and tough authority figures.\n\nAtkins has appeared in numerous films including \"The Fog\" (1980), \"The Ninth Configuration\" (1980), \"Escape from New York\" (1981), \"Creepshow\" (1982), \"\" (1982), \"Night of the Creeps\" (1986), \"Lethal Weapon\" (1987), \"Maniac Cop\" (1988), \"Two Evil Eyes\" (1990), \"Bob Roberts\" (1992), \"Striking Distance\" (1993), and \"Drive Angry\" (2011).\n\nAtkins was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Dorothy E. (née Williams) and George C. Atkins. During his childhood, Atkins was a fan of horror and science fiction, one of his best loved films being the Howard Hawks classic \"The Thing from Another World\". He initially had no desire to be an actor. His father worked in a Steel Mill in Pennsylvania and Atkins assumed that he would follow in his father's footsteps. He then enlisted in the United States Navy and \"noticed that the officers lived great, but that was only because they had gone to college,\"\nand so, after leaving the Navy, Atkins signed up for college where he met a girl who was involved in a theatre group. Tom attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and was a member of the Gamma Phi Fraternity. He says: \"I was in my 20s already when I got interested in acting and I liked it a lot.\"\n\nAtkins began his career in stage plays both on-and-off Broadway, before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film and television. His first movie role was in \"The Detective\", which starred Frank Sinatra. Talking of his experience working on his first feature film – and with Sinatra – Atkins says: \"It was great! It was intimidating and frightening and scary but Frank was great. He was very easy to work with. He didn't like to do a lot of takes. But then it's not like we were doing Shakespeare.\"\n\nAfter many appearances in TV series and movies, including notably as Lt. Alex Diel, a disagreeable police officer who in seasons 1 and 2 of \"The Rockford Files\" dislikes the titular character portrayed by James Garner, Atkins began working within the horror and science fiction genres. He appeared in two films directed by John Carpenter: the 1980 ghost story \"The Fog\" and the 1981 science fiction thriller \"Escape from New York\". His next role (this time a leading role) was the third instalment of the \"Halloween\" franchise, the Carpenter-produced \"\" (1982). \n\nHe completed further work with George A. Romero, appearing in three of the director's projects: the anthology \"Creepshow\" (1982), written by Stephen King; the anthology \"Two Evil Eyes\" (1990), based on tales by Edgar Allan Poe; and \"Bruiser\" (2000).\n\nHe portrayed Detective Ray Cameron in the 1986 cult horror film \"Night of the Creeps\", a role Atkins calls his very favorite. He tells \"Classic-Horror\" magazine \"It was the most fun film I've ever worked on. It was a pure giggle from beginning to end. The director Fred Dekker was very young and very talented and he went on to do \"The Monster Squad\" afterwards. I think he wrote a terrific film that was kind of a big put-on of '50s horror. And I had great lines in that movie!\"\n\nAtkins has continued to act in both the thriller and police procedural genre. He is well known to movie goers for his role as Michael Hunsaker in the Richard Donner film \"Lethal Weapon\" (1987), which stars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Gary Busey. In 1993 he took a role in \"Striking Distance\" (1993) alongside Bruce Willis, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Tom Sizemore. In television, Atkins reprised his role of Commander Diehl for a series of \"Rockford Files\" movies during the 1990s.\n\nAtkins is a frequent player in shows in the Pittsburgh theatre scene, most famously in the one-man show \"The Chief\" at Pittsburgh Public Theater, in which he depicted the late founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney. Also at the Public, he played the title role in \"Macbeth\", opposite Jean Smart as Lady Macbeth and Keith Fowler as Macduff. He was the star of \"A Musical Christmas Carol\" at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera, portraying the character of Ebenezer Scrooge. He appeared on Broadway in David Storey's \"The Changing Room\", for which he received the 1973 Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Performer.\n\nIn 2009, he had a supporting role as a retired sheriff in the remake \"My Bloody Valentine 3D\" and co-starred with Nicolas Cage in Todd Farmer's \"Drive Angry\", in 2011; both films are directed by Patrick Lussier.\n\nAtkins' first wife was actress Garn Stephens, who appeared in \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch\". Following the couple's divorce, he married Janis Lee Rodgers on March 15, 1986, with whom he has one child, Taylor.\n\n\n"}

The southern part ends with one block, on the east side, in City of London; the rest is in the London Borough of Islington, the north end being (the) Angel. It crosses Old Street/Clerkenwell Road. In the north it splits Clerkenwell from Finsbury; the south was sometimes used as a demarcator but all but the southern corporate/legal/financial end in the modern era forms the heart of the highly developed mixed-use district Barbican.\n\nAll of the road is inside the Central London congestion charge zone.\n\nIt is mostly fronted by offices and shops, else by some buildings of City University London. It also contains the central library of the Society of Genealogists, one of London's most important reference collections, \n\nThe main campus of the university centres takes up a set of back streets, many broad and pedestrianised, west, including the large semi-garden public square, Northampton Square. \n\nDB Schenker Rail (UK) Headquarters is a building that is a merger of numbers, № 310. \n\nA shop of the road in the 1840s was the first shop of baker and confectioner Tom Smith (1823-1869) where he popularised, and may have 'invented', the Christmas cracker.\n\nLondon Bus routes serving the street:\n\nSome sources claim the road was named after the estate or garden written variously 'Goswelle' or 'Goderell' of (medieval noble) Robert de Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk; others single out \"Gos-wel\" to be the meaningful phonemes and so posit a very local \"God's Well\" (a sacred well). The Roman founding of the city (see Londinium) was in the pre-Christian years of the empire and it may have been multi-god before listed in Christian times. Until 1864 named generally Goswell Street, as in Charles Dickens' \"Pickwick Papers\" (in the novel, the protagonist Samuel Pickwick lodged there with Mrs. Bardell).\n\nThe New River low aqueduct ran along Goswell Road before turning to terminate at New River Head on Rosebery Avenue. Its course is locally culverted (underground).\n\nSome (notably Olympic medallist Peter Radford) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run by James Parrott on 9 May 1770. He ran the 1-mile length of Old Street to finish somewhere within the grounds/building of St Leonard's, Shoreditch (church). Timing methods at this time were - after invention of the chronometer by John Harrison - accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly, and sporting authorities of the time accepted the claim as genuine. Old Street has a 11 foot downward fall (but note intermittent gentle undulations), and the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.\n\nOn 15 October 1940, approximately 150 people were sheltering in the basement of Dame Alice Owen's School, then on Goswell Road. A large parachute bomb squarely hit the building, causing majority-collapse and blocking access to the damaged basement. The blast wave from the bomb caused the New River culvert to rupture, flooding the shelter, drowning most survivors.\n\nA memorial to the victims stands in Owen's Fields at the northern end of Goswell Road.\n\n"}

The largest city in Wayanad district, it is the headquarters of Sultan Bathery taluk.\n\nIt is a quiet and peaceful town. The place came to be known by its new name after the Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan invaded the region and used the Jain Temple located here as a battery. The pleasant weather in this beautiful town, coupled with excellent opportunities for shopping and spectacular historical sites makes the town of Sultan Bathery a popular tourist destination that is visited by tourists all year round. Located at an altitude of 1000 meters above the sea level, the town of Sultan Bathery boasts of a fantastic topography: majestic hills interspersed with valleys, cliffs and plains. Not only is Sultan Bathery now the largest town in the entire Wayanad district, but the place is also reputed for its tourism and commercial activities. The main attractions for the tourists are the pre-historic caves, jungle trails, sparkling streams and rivers and lush greenery of the undulating hills, along with many options to explore the city and its surroundings. Stopovers such as the Edakkal Caves, Chethalayam Falls, the Jain Temple, Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary, Ambalavayal Heritage Museum and St. Mary's and Assumption Church make this town a suitable choice for every kind of traveller, having something for everyone to see.\n\nSultan Bathery lies on the Kozhikode–Kollegal National Highway (NH 766) 97 km from Kozhikode. It is 114 kilometers from Mysore and about 100 kilometers from Ooty (Udagamandalam). It is also connected with Nilambur.\nThe people primarily depend on agriculture for a living.\nSulthan Bathery is situated at about 930 metres above mean sea level. One can find beautiful folded hills across the horizon. The climate is pleasant throughout the year. The town has the National Highway 766 passing through it. The town is the centre of tourism in Wayanad District. It has become a very popular destination among tourists from India's software valley of Bangalore.\n\nThis town was part of Kidanganadu village, which got its name because of the presence of the Kidangans the tribes. During the invasion of Malabar by Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan, the town was used by the Mysore army as the storeroom or battery for his ammunition. Thus the town came to be known as Sultan's Battery and later as Sultan Bathery, the Malayalam version of its name.\n\nSultan Bathery is a historical place and its ancient history goes in sync with the history of Wayanad. The recorded history of this district exists only from the 10th century onward. In 930 AD, emperor Erayappa of Ganga Dynasty led his troops to the south-west of Mysore and after conquering, called it Bayalnad meaning the land of swamps. After Erayappa, his sons Rachamalla and Battunga fought each other for the new kingdom of their father's legacy. Rachamalla was killed and Battunga became the undisputed ruler of Bayalnad. In 12th century AD, Gangas were dethroned from Bayalnad by Kadamba dynasty of North Canara. In 1104 AD Vishnuvardhana of Hoysala invaded Bayalnad followed by Vijayanagara dynasty in 16th century. In 1610 AD Udaiyar Raja Wadiyar of Mysore drove out Vijayanagara General and became the ruler of Bayalnad and the Nilgiris. Bayalnad is the present Wayanad. When Wayanad was under Hyder Ali's rule, the ghat road from Vythiri to Thamarassery invented. Then the British rulers developed this route to Carter road. \n\nThe British rule in Wayanad has two periods. The first was the rule of the East India Company, which ruled Wayanad from the hands of Pazhassi Raja. It continued until the queen took direct control from the East India Company in 1858. Until 1947, Wayanad was under the rule of the Malabar Collector. History has it that Wayanad has a rich folk culture that gave way to the British domination of Wayanad. Edakkal Caves are also evidence of the existence of the Neolithic civilization in Wayanad. According to HS Graeme, Thalassery Sub-Collector TH Balan was the first to start a revenue settlement in Wayanad. In Grammy's time there were divisions of Munnadu, Muthoornadu, Ilangkornadu, Nallurnadu, Edanashankur, Poronnur, Kurumbala, Wayanad, Nambikkoli and Ganapathivattam. They were divided into new parts for administrative convenience. The importance and relevance of the place Ganapativattom has been mentioned often in the reports. History records that Sultan Bathery later became the place of Ganapathivattam on the roadside during the battle of Hyder Ali and Tipu. It is believed that the centuries old Ganpati temple was converted into a Ganapativattom. The British named the Sultan's Battery, which in later history means the Sultan's Armory, as Ganapathivattam was known as a small synonym for Ganapathivattam. It is believed to have been a commercial center during this period and a place on the road to Mysore. Ganapati grew as the medieval cities flourished, the four-way street, the main highway, and the center of worship. In 1934, the Kidanganad Panchayat was established. From the administration of the Malabar District Board, Ganapathivattam became the administration of Kidanganad panchayat. The Niluppuzha Panchayat was formed in 1968 by the division of Kidanganad Panchayat, Nenmeni Panchayat in 1974 and Sultanbathery Panchayat in 1968. New places of worship and educational institutions have emerged in different parts of the panchayat with the support of Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities. The Ganapati Temple, the Jain Temple and the Malankara Mosque are examples of the ancient history of Sultan Bathery. There is evidence that Sultanbathery and other parts of Wayanad had been in contact through Tamil, Karnataka and Kodagu villages since medieval times. Sultan Bathery is known as the confluence of ancient and ancient cultures. The history of Sultan Bathery completes the history of the colonists and bureaucrats who came to the land for the reward of their plight. In the late 20th century, the first glimpses of educational activities began to appear. As a result of the efforts of the 1920s, an LP school was established in the Sultan Bathery under the Malabar District Board. From then until now the progress of the country has been enormous. From time immemorial, the region was home to the native tribes of Chettiars, Paniyar, Kurumar and Urali Nayakkar. Although there are many ethnic groups among the tribals, their main occupation is agriculture. The panchayath has 26 temples, 15 churches and 15 mosques. Sultan Bathery has a Jain temple that is about 2000 years old. The center, which is in the possession of the Department of Archeology, has no festivals other than temple rituals. The festival at Sultan Bathery Mariamman Kovil is one of the festivals celebrated here. It is considered as the national festival of Bathery. Similar festivals are celebrated in the Bathery Mahaganapathi Temple, Kuppadi Devi Temple and Karivallikkunnu Temple.\n\nThere are many government and private school offering education.\nCompared to other districts of Kerala, institutions offering higher education are limited in Wayanad. One of the oldest colleges in Wayanad is St Mary's College, Sulthan Bathery, established in 1965. This arts and science college is affiliated to University of Calicut. Pazhassi Raja College, Pulpally, established in 1982, is another major college located nearby. Government Engineering College located at Mananthavady is the nearest engineering college. It is affiliated to Kannur University.\n\nSultan Bathery has very good road connectivity with south Indian states. The major Road is NH 766 connected to Mysore, Bangalore and Kozhikode, two State highways connected to Ooty and Coimbatore and a state highway connected to Mangalore, Kannur, Thalassery and Kasaragod. Sulthan Bathery is the biggest transport hub of Wayanad district. It is located near the border with the Karnataka state. There is a major Kerala Transport Depot in Sulthan Bathery. Most of the long-distance buses to Kozhikode, Ooty and Bangalore start from this depot. The town also has two smaller bus stations for local travellers. The Periya ghat road connects Mananthavady to Kannur and Thalassery. The Thamarassery mountain road connects Calicut with Kalpetta. The Kuttiady mountain road connects Vatakara with Kalpetta and Mananthavady. The Palchuram mountain road connects Kannur and Iritty with Mananthavady. The road from Nilambur to Ooty is also connected to Wayanad through the village of Meppadi.\n\nThe nearest railway stations are at Mysore and Calicut. The nearest airport is at Calicut and Kannur.\n\nSulthan Bathery is located at . It has an average elevation of .\n\nSultan's Battery assembly constituency is part of Wayanad (Lok Sabha constituency). Its MP is Rahul Gandhi, and the MLA is I. C.

Stevens, at Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nPhoenix measured long, wide and deep. She had 25 cabin berths and additional 12 berths in steerage.\n\nOriginally built to sail from New Brunswick, New Jersey, to New York City, \"Phoenix\" became the first steamboat to sail the open ocean, from New York to Philadelphia, in June 1809. The reason for this journey was that the restrictions placed on Stevens by the New York steamboat monopoly held by Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston meant that he could not operate profitably. Stevens decided to risk a journey over the open ocean so that he could operate on the Delaware River.\n\nThe journey was hazardous, and a schooner accompanying \"Phoenix\" was driven off by a storm. \"Phoenix\" made harbor at Barnegat, New Jersey, and after waiting several days for the storm to subside, eventually sailed around New Jersey and up the Delaware River.\n\nFollowing the journey, \"Phoenix\" made her first trip on the Delaware between Philadelphia and Trenton, on July 5, 1809.\n\n"}
{"id": "2104415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104415", "title": "CD single", "text": "CD single\n\nA CD single (sometimes abbreviated to CDS) is a music single in the form of a compact disc. The standard in the Red Book for the term \"CD single\" is an 8 cm (3 inch) CD (or Mini CD). It now refers to any single recorded onto a CD of any size, particularly the CD5, or 5-inch CD single. The format was introduced in the mid-1980s but did not gain its place in the market until the early 1990s. With the rise in digital downloads in the early 2010s, sales of CD singles have decreased.\n\nCommercially released CD singles can vary in length from two songs (an A side and B side, in the tradition of 7\" 45rpm records) up to six songs like an EP. Some contain multiple mixes of one or more songs (known as remixes), in the tradition of 12\" vinyl singles, and in some cases, they may also contain a music video for the single itself as well as a collectible poster. Depending on the nation, there may be limits on the number of songs and total length for sales to count in singles charts.\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms\" (1985) is reported to have been the world's first CD single, issued in the UK in two separate singles as a promotional item, one distinguished with a logo for the tour, Live in '85, and a second to commemorate the Australian leg of the tour marked Live in '86. Containing four tracks, it had a very limited print run. The first commercially released CD Single was Angeline by John Martyn released on 1 February 1986. CD singles were first made eligible for the UK Singles Chart in 1987, and the first number 1 available on the format in that country was \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" by Whitney Houston in May 1987.\n\nThe Mini CD single CD3 format was originally created for use for singles in the late 1980s, but met with limited success, particularly in the US. The smaller CDs were more successful in Japan and had a resurgence in Europe early this century, marketed as \"Pock it\" CDs, being small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. By 1989, the CD3 was in decline in the US (replaced by the 5-inch CD single, called CD-5).\n\nIt was common in the 1990s for US record companies to release both a two-track CD and a multi-track (usually \"remix\") maxi CD. In the UK, record companies would also release two CDs but, usually, these consisted of three tracks or more each.\n\nDuring the 1990s, CD single releases became less common in certain countries and were often released in smaller editions, as the major record labels feared they were cannibalizing the sales of higher-profit-margin CD albums. Pressure from record labels made singles charts in some countries become song charts, allowing album cuts to chart based only on airplay, without a single ever being released. In the US, the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 made this change in December 1998, after which very few songs were released in the CD single format in the US, but they remained extremely popular in the UK and other countries, where charts were still based solely on single sales and not radio airplay. At the end of the 1990s, the CD was the biggest-selling single format in the UK, but in the US, the dominant single format was airplay. With the advent of digital music sales, the CD single has largely been replaced as a distribution format in most countries, and most charts now include digital download counts as well as physical single sales.\n\nIn Australia, the \"Herald Sun\" reported the CD single is \"set to become extinct\". In early July 2009, leading music store JB Hi-Fi ceased stocking CD singles because of declining sales, with copies of the week's No. 1 single often selling as few as only 350 copies across all their stores nationwide. While CD singles no longer maintain their own section of the store, copies are still distributed but placed with the artist's albums. That is predominantly the case for popular Australian artists such as Jessica Mauboy, Kylie Minogue and, most recently, Delta Goodrem, whose then-recent singles (\"What Happened to Us\", \"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\" and \"Sitting on Top of the World\" respectively) were released on CD in limited quantities. The ARIA Singles Chart is now \"predominantly compiled from legal downloads\", and ARIA also stopped compiling their physical singles sales chart. \"On a Mission\" by Gabriella Cilmi was the last CD single to be stocked in Kmart, Target and Big W, who then concluded stocking newly released singles. Sanity Entertainment, having resisted the decline for longer than the other major outlets, has also ceased selling CD singles.\n\nIn China and South Korea, CD single releases have been rare ever since the format was introduced, due of the amount of infringement and illegal file sharing over the internet, and most of the time singles have generally been album cuts chart based only on airplay, but with the advent of digital music the charts have also occasionally included digital download counts.\n\nIn Greece and Cyprus, the term \"CD single\" is used to describe an extended play (EP) in which there may be anywhere from three to six different tracks. These releases charted on the Greek Singles Chart (before it abandoned tracking altogether) with songs released as singles.\n\nThe original \"CD single\" (sometimes mini CD single or 3-inch CD or CD3 in the US) is a music single released on a mini Compact Disc that measures in diameter, rather than the standard . They are manufactured using the same methods as standard full-size CDs, and can be played in most standard audio CD players and CD-ROM disc drives.\n\nThe format was first released in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, France, West Germany, and Hong Kong in 1987 as the replacement for the 7-inch single. While mini CDs have fallen out of popularity among most major record labels (partly due to their incompatibility with many slot-loading CD players), they remain a popular, low cost way for independent musicians and groups to release music. \nCapable of holding up to 20 minutes of music, most mini CD singles contain at least two tracks, often consisting of a single edit and an instrumental version in the same way as 7-inch vinyl singles.\n\nThese were released in both a 5\" size slim jewel case and long flip-out sleeve snap-packs or (Japanese: tanzaku) as they are known in Japan. These sleeves could be 'snapped' and folded into a small 3\" (8 cm) square, rather than the original 6\" by 3\" inch (15×8 cm) length when originally sold.\n\nBeginning in 1999 some labels began to package mini CDs in 12 cm slimline cases. As the \"tanzaku\" sleeves slowly morphed into the use of slimline jewel cases, the mini CD single was haulted from production in the early 2000s.\n\nAs popularity diminished, one of the last Japanese 8 cm CD single released was a reissue and repackaging of \"I Was Born to Love You\" by Queen in 2004. Many of the artists who released 3\" CDs are from that era, including Wink, Madonna, Phil Collins, Michael Jackson, Queen, U2, Prince, Metallica, Bros, Huey Lewis and the News, Bon Jovi, Kylie Minogue, Falco and George Michael. Some singles packaged in 5\" single jewel cases contained a 5\" CD adapter.\n\nMost were sold at around ¥1,000 (£6 or $9) at the time of release during the late 1980s, early 2000s to the present day.\n\nHowever, there has been a small revival in the mini CD single with Japanese artists such as Hibari Misora with a reissue of her 1989 single \"Kawa no Nagare no Yoni\" in May 2019 in original long \"tanzaku\" form, by the record company Nippon Columbia.\n\nUS versions were often packaged in cardboard slipcases, either 3\" square or 6\" by 3\" gatefold. Others were released in 5\" slimline single cases, which allowed an adapter to be included with the CD. At the time of first release in 1987, their retail price was between $4 and $6 at least $3 less than even the least-expensive 5-inch discs. Delos Records, a small, independent label, issued the first commercially available 3-inch CDs in 1987 with 20 classical and jazz titles. The Massachusetts-based Rykodisc issued Frank Zappa's “Peaches en Regalia” the first pop 3-inch CD. Initially when released, 300,000 of the discs were shipped to retail outlets. Noted oldies label Rhino had a series of over 60 3<nowiki>\" CDs released throughout 1988 entitled \"Lil'</nowiki> Bit Of Gold\".\n\nUK 3\" CDs were made mostly in a small square case/cover form only, some including a 5\" CD adapter to use in normal compact disc players. Although the format was not widely available in the United Kingdom, several artists have released singles in the format.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, a 3-inch CD follows the Red Book standard for CD digital audio. The major difference is that the smaller physical size of the disc allows for fewer data sectors, meaning the disc can store less audio. The majority of audio CD players and CD-ROM drives have a smaller circular indentation in the CD tray for holding these discs. Most slot-loading drives, such as those found in some car CD players, are unable to manipulate the smaller discs or their adapters. Laptop drives generally only require the centre hole to hold the disc so the smaller diameter is irrelevant. In fact, software and drivers for some hardware are provided on the 3\" discs.\n\nIn the United States and United Kingdom, the format barely lasted into the early 1990s, partly due to inconvenience of needing to attach an adapter on every disc (very few packages were issued with one) before playing. Sony remained in support of the 3-inch CD having had plans to launch a 3-inch CD player for the Japanese market in 1988. \nIt was largely replaced by simply putting less music on a regular full-size CD, at least among major labels. The full-size discs are a more standard manufacturing process and so may end up being cheaper to press. The CD single format continued until 2000 for Japanese releases. Despite the unpopularity it survived with publishers adopting the 3-inch CD as an inexpensive way of presenting bonus material with books.\n\n\nThe slim jewel boxes used for 3\" CDs are nearly the same size as 3.5\" floppy disks, making storage boxes for 3.5\" floppies usable for 3\" CDs as well.\n\nIn September 2003, there was talk of ringtones for mobile phones outstripping CD singles sales for the year 2004.\n\nWoolworths Group, which previously accounted for one third of all CD sales in the country, stopped selling CD singles in August 2008, citing the \"terminal decline\" of the format as customers moved to digital downloads as their preferred method of purchasing single tracks (the Woolworths chain itself would collapse the following November).\n\nIn July 2009, \"The Guardian\" reported that Florence + The Machine's single 'Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)' sold a CD and 7\" vinyl combined total of 64 copies, where it reached No. 16 in the Mid-Week Chart.\n\nIn March 2011, Mercury Records announced that they were to stop manufacturing CD singles for lack of demand and loss of money on the format in 2010.\n\nAs of 2012, selected HMV stores sold a small selection of CD singles, mostly charity releases and acts from \"The X Factor\".\n\n"}

It uses posable 4.5\" action figures with 14 points of articulation and each figure comes with 8 interchangeable accessories in the form of weapons/armour.\n\nIn an attempt to branch out, Mark Rein-Hagen, creator of the role-playing game, founded Atomoton, a company that would focus more on collectible forms of gaming. Its first product was Z-G, which debuted at Gen Con in 2001. A large departure from his previous work, this was a science fiction game featuring cybernetic gladiators. It is based on the setting developed for the unpublished pen and paper RPG \"Exiles\".\n\nInitially, the game was released with three figures (colored red, blue, and green) with their own interchangeable equipment and ability sets. This was quickly followed by \"Citizen Z-G\", a collectible card set (sold in 10 card randomly inserted booster packs) used to play an expanded version of the game. Planned for future release was a second card set, new accessories for the figures, a nationwide sanctioned tournament league, a companion video game, an animated series, and an accompanying role-playing game.\n\nHowever, by 2003, the game had been canceled, and Atomoton shut down. Many factors are cited for this failure, but the largest single reason was the loss of its main distributor following 9/11 (a difficult time for the entire tabletop game market). Other reasons include its targeting of children rather than serious collectors, and criticism of the fallibility of the randomizing element in the combat system.\n\nGame play is a combination between a collectible card game and a miniature wargame. The figures (known as \"Zigs\") move about on a self-constructed battlefield, with their movement and actions determined by a set of cards. Each of the three initial figures came with 10 cards (one for each piece of removable equipment and one for the figure itself), as well as a stat card representing the character inside the suit. Each round, players choose three pieces of equipment out of their deck and use the stats on each to determine turn order, movement, and attack type and strength. The center of the game is the card. Movement of the characters is measured in card lengths and combat is randomized by spinning the cards. Actual attack success or failure was determined by comparing 3 colored dots on the attacking card with a random card from the defender's deck. Two or more matching colors indicate a successful hit and destruction of the equipment shown on the defender's card. The game is lost when a player is reduced to less than 3 cards/parts, or his figure (\"ulster\") card is destroyed.\n\nThe game could also be played in an expanded format using the collectible card set. Here, upgraded forms of the base equipment cards could be found, as well as \"maneuver\" cards, which could be held in reserve to allow its user to carry out special techniques.\n\n"}

Career highlights include reaching 20 million views on their YouTube channel, \"Secrets Keep You Sick\" was nominated for a Grammy in the category of \"Best Recording Package\". Their single \"Gravity\" from the album \"This Too Shall Pass\" reached No. 1 on the CHR Rock charts. The band has more recently written much themed music for sports and television. Most notably, the theme songs \"\", Chicago Cubs, and several NFL teams.\n\nTheir debut album \"This Too Shall Pass\" was released February 22, 2006 on Tooth & Nail Records. The follow-up \"Secrets Keep You Sick\" was released May 22, 2007. \"Secrets Keep You Sick\" was nominated for a Grammy under the \"Best Recording Package\" category, but the band lost to \"Cassadaga\" by Bright Eyes. Directly following the release of \"Secrets\", the band spent their summer on the Vans Warped Tour. The Fold played alongside friends Plain White T's and The Spill Canvas on their own dollar to support their 2008 sold-out UK tour. Upon returning to the U.S., The Fold parted ways with Tooth & Nail, and completed their third studio album \"Dear Future, Come Get Me\" with Zack and Kenneth (Cartel, All Time Low, Mayday Parade), who also recorded \"Secrets Keep You Sick\".\n\nIn December 2009, the band released a self-shot music video for \"Every Band in the USA\"\",\" a parody of the Miley Cyrus hit \"Party in the U.S.A.\". The video has been viewed on YouTube nearly 500,000 times. On June 29, 2010 the band released a video for the song \"Neverender\" off \"Dear Future, Come Get Me\". The video was filmed at Willowbrook High School, the former high school of frontman Dan Castady and also of Tom Higgenson, the lead singer of the Plain White T's.\n\nIn November 2010, The Fold released the song \"This Christmas\" on iTunes, along with two unofficial, self made videos. One of which featured all of the best crowd reactions from Oprah's Ultimate Favorite Things, 2010. The video can be seen here on their YouTube channel.\n\nIn January 2011, the band recorded a song titled \"The Weekend Whip\", the theme song for the \"Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu\" television series. The band announced in early 2012 that they would release a full EP of ninja-themed pop rock songs aimed at the Ninjago demographic; rolling it out a single at a time via digital outlets, and then completing the process in late Summer 2012 with a full EP release, along with karaoke sing-a-long versions, and various other exclusive content entitled \"For The Spinners\".\n\nIn 2012, The Fold wrote and released \"Let's Go Cubbies\" which was adopted as the official song of the Chicago Cubs. It continues to be played during every Cubs broadcast on WGN Radio 720AM. The Fold performed live at Wrigley Field on opening day April 5, 2012.\n\nThe Fold's fourth album, \"Moving Past\", was co-produced by the band and Sean O'Keefe, and mixed by J.R. McNeely. The album came out October 15, 2013.\n\nIn 2016, The Fold was tasked with writing more music for the Cubs, including a song called \"Let The Games Begin\", which they played at Opening Day at Wrigley Field, and again at the final rally before the post-season. The Cubs went all the way and won the World Series that year, the first time in 108 years.\n\nThe Fold continue to write and record music in 2017, mostly for LEGO Ninjago, but there has been talk of late of a new full-length album.\n\nIn the season 9 finale of \"Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu\", The Fold appear as LEGO Minifigures to congratulate the Ninja for defeating Lord Garmadon.

It was founded by Don Feinberg and Wendy Littlefield, owners of beer import company Vanberg & DeWulf and three Belgian breweries including Duvel Moortgat. Ommegang started up in a purpose-built building based on a traditional Belgian farmhouse, set on a former hop farm in the Susqehanna River Valley, south of Cooperstown, New York, on County Route 33 in the town of Milford.\n\nSince its opening, Ommegang has grown rapidly; in early 2005, its owner said they have been unable to meet demand for their ales and as a result would add 40 percent to their production capacity over the next year.\n\nBy 2003, the Belgian breweries had all been absorbed into large corporations. Feinberg and Littlefield sold their share of Ommegang in 2003 to Belgian brewer Duvel Moortgat Brewery, brewers of the Duvel Golden Ale. Duvel Moortgat brewed limited amounts of beer for Brewery Ommegang in 2006 to help meet demand, but has not brewed any since then.\n\nBrewery Ommegang distributes its beers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, including Alaska and Hawaii but excluding Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Mississippi. Ommegang has also begun exporting to Canada, the US Virgin Islands, and Mexico. As of September 2018, Ommegang has begun exporting to France.\n\nEach summer, the brewery hosts a large beer-tasting event, known as \"Belgium Comes to Cooperstown\". The event, which occurs on a Saturday in July or August, includes seven hours of unlimited sampling of over 200 Belgian and Belgian-style beers followed by food, live music, and a bonfire.\n\nOn 7 October 2007, Brewery Ommegang hosted the inaugural \"CX @ Ommegang\", a cyclocross race organized by Team SCARR, a cycling team with Brewery Ommegang as their title sponsor. Cyclocross is popular in Belgium and a cyclocross race on the grounds of a Belgian-style brewery was a natural fit. Over 150 racers from New York State registered for the event. The course included a hairpin turn inside the main event tent.\n\nOmmegang brews six ales full-time:\n\nOmmegang Abbey Ale and Three Philosophers can be aged for flavoring.

This is accomplished by a dial approximately 3 inches in diameter in the center of the controller (almost in the same location as the DualShock analog sticks).\n\nThe dial was the first force feedback steering wheel available on the PlayStation. Its name was derived from the action of \"jogging\" a dial like those found on some VCRs and the action of putting this on a controller. Actions such as torque steer, collisions, and feedback from turning the automobile all can be felt through the dial as the player manipulates it to maneuver their vehicle through the course.\n\nThe Jogcon would later be sold separately from the Ridge Racer R4 game.\n\nThe Jogcon is fully compatible with Ridge Racer Type 4, V-Rally 2, the Playstation version of Breakout (video game) and the PlayStation 2 game Ridge Racer V. In other games, it can be used as a regular PlayStation controller by turning off the Jogcon mode using the mode switch above the PlayStation logo. \n\nThe Jogcon also has a relatively unknown neGcon compatibility mode; by holding the mode button as you turn on the PlayStation, the Jogcon wheel emulates the neGcon's twist functionality. However, as force feedback isn't supported in this mode, the wheel will not self-center. On top of this, the default button mapping for a neGcon usually means the X and Square buttons are used as acceleration and brake, whereas in Ridge Racer Type 4 and V-Rally 2, these controls are moved to the shoulder buttons to allow for both thumbs to control the wheel. As such, the neGcon compatibility mode expands the list of games the Jogcon can be used in significantly, but the experience is considerably more awkward than when it is used in Jogcon-compatible games.\n\n\n"}

It was the Toronto Board of Education's first school to require students to wear uniforms.\n\nA think tank created the concept of the school.\n\nUrsula Franklin Academy opened in the fall of 1995 in the former Brockton High School, which originally was built and named as 1966. The Toronto Board of Education (TBE) planned it as a traditional academic school that had focus on languages, mathematics, science, and technology. John Doherty, a trustee in the TBE, said that \"We're not trying to create a magnet school or an elite school that has waiting lists and so on. We want it serving the local community.\" Ursula Franklin Academy moved into Western Technical-Commercial School in September 2002.\n\nUFA's school values are closely tied to the mindset and societal perception of its namesake, Dr. Ursula Franklin.\n\n\"Ursula Franklin Academy is a small community of learners which offers integrated liberal arts packages, in addition to the general fundamental courses of T.D.S.B curriculum, preparing students for academic programs at the post-secondary level.\"\n\nStudents generally wear a navy blue uniform, although variations of uniform style exist. The existing variations include white and navy blue polo shirts and T-shirts; Oxford shirts; and rugby shirts sporting the school colours. Students alter their uniform to improve the already existing requirements. Initiatives are currently going on in order to reform the uniform.\n\nWhen the school was in the planning stages, students were to wear school uniforms. At the time no other school in the Toronto Board of Education required uniforms.\n\nWhen the school opened in 1995, Dr. Ursula Franklin chose the official school colours as navy blue, hunter green and burgundy. These colours were chosen because in combination, they do not represent the flag of any nation-state. This was intended to create an atmosphere of global citizenship for students at UFA.\nStudents, Teachers and the Administration are working on adding different colour combinations to the uniform. The uniform will still not represent the flag of any nation-state.\n\nAt Ursula Franklin Academy students go through a four-day rotation. Unique to the school is the Enriched Wednesday program. Through Wednesdays students get to explore interests that may not be offered as part of the regular curriculum. Each month, students sign up for sessions that can include anything from skiing all day to beach volleyball to rock climbing to exploring neuro-science. Some typical Wednesday sessions that are offered almost every block are: student council, guitar jam sessions, fashion class, study halls, remedial tutorials, yearbook preparation, jazz appreciation, films of nature, etc. Students are encouraged to run their own Wednesday sessions with a supervising teacher or staff member.\n\nUFA offers a range of clubs and organizations for students ranging from co-curricular endeavours like the science club, The Franklin (newspaper), economics club, radio club, and Model UN to a student council, improv team, and S.A.S.S (Students Against Stereotyping Sexuality). UFA Robotics club won a silver medal in citywide high school robotics competition.\n\nAlthough UFA is a rather small school, many of its students and teachers participate in UFA's sports teams. Aside from the usual high school teams (boys' soccer, baseball, swim team), UFA offers some unusual sports. The Dragonboat Team and the Ultimate Team (a.k.a. the Ultimate Frisbee Team) are exemplary highlights. Although many teams are coached by teachers and/or \"community coaches\", some teams are coached and managed by UFA students (e.g. the Ultimate Team).\n\n"}

The word may be translated literally as \"boss-ship\" or “boss-hood”; it was often used in a similar context as the English language terms “domination” or “supremacy”. \n\nIn the political context, ‘’baaskap’’ was evoked as a reference to the social, political, and economic domination of South Africa by that country’s minority white population.\n\nProponents of \"baasskap\" (who constituted the largest faction of apartheid ideologues in the National Party and state institutions) applied racial segregation in a systematic way, in order to 'preserve racial purity', and to ensure economic and political spheres were dominated by Afrikaners. However, proponents of \"baasskap\" were not necessarily opposed to black South African participation in the economy, as long as black labour was controlled in a manner that preserved the economic domination of Afrikaners.\n\nProminent proponents of \"baasskap\" included J.G. Strydom, Prime Minister from 1954 to 1958, and C.R. Swart, Minister of Justice. Hendrik Verwoerd had sympathy for the \"purist\" faction of apartheid ideologues, which opposed economic integration of black South Africans (in contrast to supporters of \"baasskap\" who were more concerned with white domination in an integrated economy). Nonetheless, Verwoerd provided the hitherto crude concept of \"baasskap\" with a veneer of intellectual respectability.\n"}

Inside Chechnya his men were sometimes referred to as the \"Kakievtsy\". Unlike the other Chechen pro-Moscow forces in Chechnya, Kakiyev and his men are not former rebels and during the First Chechen War were some of the few Chechen militants who fought on the Russian side.\n\nKakiyev has been declared a Hero of the Russian Federation, has twice received the Order of Courage and was awarded two specially engraved guns by the Russian Minister of Defense. He had been engaged in power struggles for overall military authority with the president of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov and Sulim Yamadayev. In 2007, having left the post of battalion commander, he was appointed deputy military commissar of Chechnya for military-patriotic education of youth. \n\nSaid-Magomed Kakiyev was born on 22 February 1970 in the village of Ken-Yurt, Nadterechny District, Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. He belongs to the teip Zandakoy.\nAfter he finished a Grozny vocational school in 1989 he went to serve in the Soviet army in a reconnaissance battalion of the Transcaucasian Military District. He was assigned to Nagorno-Karabakh where he witnessed at first hand the devastating aftermath of the Soviet Union collapse. In the Nagorno-Karabakh War, he acquired the rank of Major.\n\nHe came home to a Chechnya in turmoil. Dzhokhar Dudayev had started a rebellion against Soviet, later Russian rule, but the Northern part of Chechnya where Kakiyev hailed from was not so enthusiastic about the secession. After allegedly witnessing atrocities, Kakiyev joined the opposition against Dudaev. In 1993 he was seriously hurt when his grenade launcher exploded during an assassination attempt on Dudayev. He lost his left hand, an eye, and his nose and had to have his face reconstructed beyond recognition at a hospital in Moscow.\n\nIn 1994, Said-Magomed returned to Chechnya to fight on the federal side in the increasingly heated conflict. In November 1994, he participated in the failed assault on Grozny by the Chechen opposition to Dudayev. Kakiev's detachment managed to seize the building of the republican television center, but then they had to retreat, with the detachment losing 80 people while breaking through.\n\nAt the beginning of the First Chechen War, in January 1995, Kakiyev took part in the storming of Grozny by the federal forces. The most formative event in his life was the Dagestanskaya Street massacre on 6 August 1996 during the separatists retaking of Grozny, when 30 pro-federal fighters and militia officers defending the city mayor's office were shot and killed despite promises of free passage through the city. Kakiyev alone managed to escape. Kakiyev has consistently blamed Doku Umarov and Ruslan Gelayev for the Dagestanskaya massacre.\n\nAt the end of 1996, Aslan Maskhadov declared Kakiyev an outlaw and put a price on his head: whoever killed him would receive the title of Hero of Ichkeria. Kakiyev had to take his relatives into hiding in his birth village Ken-Yurt, which has never been under separatist control, and live in Moscow for almost three years. During this time he studied at the Tax Police Academy in Moscow. (He also earlier briefly studied at Alma Ata University through distance learning.) Then he moved to Rostov and enlisted as a contractor in the 22nd brigade of the Russian Ministry of Defense. According to some sources during this time he performing GRU duties in Ingushetia and Dagestan.\n\nWhen in September 1999, the Russian army entered Chechnya after the Chechen incursion in Dagestan and the Russian apartment bombings, Said was able to return to Northern Chechnya. He was appointed deputy head of the Nadterechny district administration. In December 1999 he joined the Russian army. With some of his fellow anti-Maskhadov rebels, he formed a special-purpose company of the 42nd motorized rifle division of the Russian army (the first Chechen unit on the Russian side in the Second Chechen War) and entered Grozny. Kakiyev claimed his unit was the first to hoist the Russian flag in Grozny. During the Battle of Komsomolskoye, forces commanded by Kakiyev managed to surround forces commanded by Ruslan Gelayev.\n\nOn 14 October 2002, by a presidential decree, Kakiev was awarded the title of Hero of Russia \"for courage and heroism shown in the performance of military duty in the North Caucasus region.\"\n\nOn 9 September 2003, his APC was blown up by a bomb laid by Gelayev militants. A cousin of Said-Magomed was killed, 15 people were injured, including Kakiev himself (25 bomb fragments had hit him). Kakiyev was involved in hunting down Gelayev during the winter of 2003-2004.\n\nAfter the active phase of the war, Kakiyev was the leader of the GRU Spetsnaz Special Battalion West (\"Zapad\"), reorganized from his special-purpose company, from November 2003 to 2007. Zapad, unlike other pro-Moscow factions, did not include former rebels.\n\nDisliking the Kadyrov clan, he supported Hussein Jabrailov, Akhmad Kadyrov opponent, during the 2003 President of Chechnya election campaign.\n\nKakiyev, who became a devout Sufi Muslim after his two escapes from death, was believed to be one of the more effective and disciplined of Grozny's commanders, and resented any suggestion of subordination to Ramzan Kadyrov or Sulim Yamadayev, themselves both powerful commanders loyal to Grozny. In interviews, he went so far as to put the Kremlin policy of amnesty for all defecting rebels into question.\n\nAfter he left the command of Zapad, at the end of 2007 he was appointed deputy military commissar of Chechnya for military-patriotic education of youth.\n\n"}

After gold was found in the Sierra Nevada in 1848, thousands of Chinese from Toisan in Guangdong, began to travel to the West in search of gold and riches during the California Gold Rush.\n\nChinese people historically referred to California and British Columbia as Gold Mountain, as evidenced by maps and returned Overseas Chinese. However, as a gold rush subsequently occurred in Australia, Bendigo in the then-colony of Victoria was referred to as \"New Gold Mountain\" (新金山), and California became known as Old Gold Mountain (); although \"Old Gold Mountain\" now specifically refers to San Francisco.\n\nThe name \"Gold Mountain\" was initially applied to California. Ships full of immigrants docked in San Francisco to disembark passengers, initially bound for the gold fields, but later to remain in the growing Chinese settlement in San Francisco. In the latter part of the 19th century, however, British Columbia also came to be referred to as \"Gold Mountain\" following the discovery of gold in the Fraser Canyon in the 1857 and the subsequent group of Chinese from San Francisco arriving by boat in June 1858, and further Chinese settlers coming from California and directly from China later on to British Columbia (which they also referred to as \"The Colonies of T'ang\" i.e. China). The term thus broadened to mean \"Western North America\". The gold seekers in British Columbia first went to the Chinatown in Victoria, on the Colony of Vancouver Island, to obtain supplies. Victoria was the dominant political and economic centre before the economic ascendancy of Vancouver (which has its own Chinatown), and remains the official seat of political power in British Columbia today.\n\nFollowing California Gold Rush, Australian gold rushes began in 1851, making Australia the 'New Gold Mountain' (), also refers to Melbourne; Sydney became 'Sydney Gold Mountain' ().\n\n\n\n"}

Some were reproduced as woodblock prints. The subjects painted likewise vary widely, but are generally elements mentioned in the calligraphy, or poetic images which add meaning or depth to that expressed by the poem. The moon is a common subject in these poems and paintings, sometimes represented by the Zen circle \"ensō\", which evokes a number of other meanings, including that of the void. Other subjects, ranging from Mount Fuji to rooftops, are frequently represented with a minimum of brushstrokes, thus evoking elegance and beauty in simplicity.\n\nNonoguchi Ryūho (1595–1669), a student of Kanō Tan'yū, is sometimes credited with founding the style; though poetry was commonly accompanied by images for centuries prior, Ryūho was the first poet to regularly include paintings alongside his calligraphy.\n\nMatsuo Bashō, known worldwide as the definitive master of haiku, frequently painted as well. \"Haiga\" became a major style of painting as a result of association with his famous works of haiku. Like his poems, Bashō's paintings are founded in a simplicity which reveals great depth, complementing the poems they are paired with. Towards the end of his life, he studied painting under , his pupil in poetry; the works of both men benefited from the exchange, and a number of works were produced combining Morikawa's painting with Bashō's poetry and calligraphy.\n\nComposing haiku, and painting accompanying pictures, was a common pastime of Edo period aesthetes, who would pursue these activities in their spare time, or at friendly gatherings as a communal form of entertainment. The famous novelist Ihara Saikaku was one of many people not normally associated with either poetry or painting, who took part. By contrast, the \"nanga\" painter Yosa Buson, widely considered second only to Bashō as a master of haiku, is said to be \"the only artist to be included in surveys both of great poets and great painters in Japanese history.\"\n\nUnlike other schools of painting which maintained a standard set of styles passed from master to apprentice, the genre of \"haiga\" encompassed a variety of artists with different approaches. Some, like Bashō, were primarily poets, accompanying their compositions with simple sketches, while others, like Buson, were primarily painters, devoting more space and centrality of focus to the image. Maruyama Goshun and Ki Baitei were among those who tended to paint portraits of poets and other figures in a relatively quick, loose style which looks somewhat cartoonish to the modern eye. Some \"haiga\" paintings, such as those by Morikawa Kyoriku, reflect the formal training of the artists, while others, like those by Nakahara Nantenbō, reflect the artist's background in Zen.\n\nOne overall trend that developed over time, despite this wide variety, was a shift from the circles of literati (\"bunjin\") painters to the orbit of the Shijō school of the naturalistic painter Maruyama Ōkyo. This move was effected primarily by Maruyama Goshun, and can be seen as well in the works of Yamaguchi Soken. Some later painters, such as Takebe Sōchō, were influenced by \"ukiyo-e\" styles, and used color in highly detailed works.\n\nThough traditional-style \"haiga\" are still produced today, contemporary artists experiment with the style, coupling haiku with digital imagery, photography, and other media.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the company's own memo they would be paid \"for moving energy to relieve congestion, without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.\"\n\nFor example, if the California power grid was congested with energy flowing south, Enron would schedule energy to be transmitted north to Oregon. They would receive a payment from California for apparently relieving congestion on the grid. Then Enron would schedule the energy to be transferred back to its point of origin, but not through California. Ultimately the energy would end up right back where it started, and Enron would be paid by California without actually putting any electricity on their grid.\n\nThe firm acknowledged in internal documents the inherent ethical dilemmas, in one internal document stating \"Traders could buy power at $250 and sell it for $1,200.

{"id": "2104510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104510", "title": "Nanolithography", "text": "Nanolithography\n\nNanolithography is a growing field of techniques within nanotechnology dealing with the engineering (etching, writing, printing) of nanometer-scale structures. From Greek, the word can be broken up into three parts: \"nano\" meaning dwarf, \"lith\" meaning stone, and \"graphy\" meaning to write, or \"tiny writing onto stone.\" Today, the word has evolved to cover the design of structures in the range of 10 to 10 meters, or structures in the nanometer range. Essentially, field is a derivative of lithography, only covering significantly smaller structures. All nanolithographic techniques can be separated into two categories: those that etch away molecules leaving behind the desired structure, and those that directly write the desired structure to a surface (similar to the way a 3D printer creates a structure).\n\nThe field of nanolithography was born out of the need to increase the number of transistors in an integrated circuit in order to maintain Moore's Law. While lithographic techniques have been around since the late 18th century, none were applied to nanoscale structures until the mid-1950s. With evolution of the semiconductor industry, demand for techniques capable of producing micro- and nano-scale structures skyrocketed. Photolithography was applied to these structures for the first time in 1958 beginning the age of nanolithography. Since then, photolithography has become the most commercially successful technique, capable of producing sub-100 nm patterns. There are several techniques associated with the field, each designed to serve its many uses in the medical and semiconductor industries. Breakthroughs in this field contribute significantly to the advancement of nanotechnology, and are increasingly important today as demand for smaller and smaller computer chips increases. Further areas of research deal with physical limitations of the field, energy harvesting, and photonics.\n\nOptical Lithography (or photolithography) is one of the most important and prevalent sets of techniques in the nanolithography field. Optical lithography contains several important derivative techniques, all that use very short light wavelengths in order to change the solubility of certain molecules, causing them to wash away in solution, leaving behind a desired structure. Several optical lithography techniques require the use of liquid immersion and a host of resolution enhancement technologies like phase-shift masks (PSM) and optical proximity correction (OPC). Some of the included techniques in this set include multiphoton lithography, X-Ray lithography, light coupling nanolithography (LCM), and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). This last technique is considered to be the most important next generation lithography (NGL) technique due to its ability to produce structures accurately down below 30 nanometers.\n\nElectron beam lithography (EBL) or electron-beam direct-write lithography (EBDW) scans a focused beam of electrons on a surface covered with an electron-sensitive film or resist (e.g. PMMA or HSQ) to draw custom shapes. By changing the solubility of the resist and subsequent selective removal of material by immersion in a solvent, sub-10 nm resolutions have been achieved. This form of direct-write, maskless lithography has high resolution and low throughput, limiting single-column e-beams to photomask fabrication, low-volume production of semiconductor devices, and research&development. Multiple-electron beam approaches have as a goal an increase of throughput for semiconductor mass-production.\nEBL can be utilized for selective protein nanopatterning on a solid substrate, aimed for ultrasensitive sensing.\n\nScanning probe lithography (SPL) is another set of techniques for patterning at the nanometer-scale down to individual atoms using scanning probes, either by etching away unwanted material, or by directly-writing new material onto a substrate. Some of the important techniques in this category include dip-pen nanolithography, thermochemical nanolithography, thermal scanning probe lithography, and local oxidation nanolithography. Dip-pen nanolithography is the most widely used of these techniques.\n\nNanoimprint lithography (NIL), and its variants, such as Step-and-Flash Imprint Lithography and laser assisted directed imprint (LADI) are promising nanopattern replication technologies where patterns are created by mechanical deformation of imprint resists, typically monomer or polymer formations that are cured by heat or UV light during imprinting. This technique can be combined with contact printing and cold welding. Nanoimprint lithography is capable of producing patterns at sub-10 nm levels.\n\nThis set of techniques include ion- and electron-projection lithographies. Ion beam lithography uses a focused or broad beam of energetic lightweight ions (like He) for transferring pattern to a surface. Using Ion Beam Proximity Lithography (IBL) nano-scale features can be transferred on non-planar surfaces.\n\nMagnetolithography (ML) is based on applying a magnetic field on the substrate using paramagnetic metal masks call \"magnetic mask\". Magnetic mask which is analog to photomask define the spatial distribution and shape of the applied magnetic field. The second component is ferromagnetic nanoparticles (analog to the Photoresist) that are assembled onto the substrate according to the field induced by the magnetic mask.\n\nNanosphere lithography uses self-assembled monolayers of spheres (typically made of polystyrene) as evaporation masks. This method has been used to fabricate arrays of gold nanodots with precisely controlled spacings.\n\nNeutral particle lithography (NPL) uses a broad beam of energetic neutral particle for pattern transfer on a surface.\n\nPlasmonic lithography uses surface plasmon excitations to generate beyond-diffraction limit patterns, benefiting from subwavelength field confinement properties of surface plasmon polaritons.\n\nThis technique uses a focused beam of high energy (MeV) protons to pattern resist material at nanodimensions and has been shown to be capable of producing high-resolution patterning well below the 100 nm mark.\n\nStencil lithography is a resist-less and parallel method of fabricating nanometer scale patterns using nanometer-size apertures as shadow-masks.\n\nQuantum optical lithography (QOL), is a diffraction-unlimited method able to write at 1 nm resolution by optical means, using a red laser diode (λ = 650nm).Complex patterns like geometrical figures and letters were obtained at 3 nm resolution on resist substrate. The method was applied to nanopattern graphene at 20 nm resolution.\n"}

He was articled to John Sherwood of Sheffield, and was admitted an attorney in January 1810. He practised in Manchester for over forty years, and was in partnership first with James Knight, then with James Grove, and finally with his son George. He spent many years in litigation and controversy in connection with the alienation of Lady Hewley's and other charities. The dispute was finally resolved by the passing of the Dissenters' Chapels Act 1844 which he had played a part in framing. With Thomas Raffles and William Roby he established the Lancashire Independent College, first at Blackburn and then at Whalley Range, where in 1840 he laid the foundation-stone of the new building, and gave £2000 towards the cost of the erection.\n\nHadfield contested Bradford as a Liberal on 12 January 1835, but was defeated by John Hardy.

In the 1990s, the Warder-Totten House's prospects for survival again looked bleak, but the building was saved a second time.\n\nBenjamin H. Warder was president of Warder, Bushnell & Glessner Company, a major manufacturer of farm machinery. It was one of five companies merged in 1902 to form International Harvester.\n\nIn 1885, Warder hired Boston architect H. H. Richardson to design his house at 1515 K Street NW.

The building was vacant for more than a dozen years, and was largely reduced to a shell by fires and vandalism. It was placed on the D.C. Preservation League's Most Endangered Places List in 1996, and remained on that list for several years. \n\nRenovated in 2001–02, it now serves as the entrance to Warder Mansion, a complex of 38 one- and two-bedroom apartments carved out of the house and a 9-story addition.\n\nThe Warder house once contained custom-made furnishings. \n\nWarder's daughter Alice (1877–1952) married diplomat John Work Garrett (1872–1942) at the house in December 1908, with First Lady Edith Roosevelt in attendance. Ambassador Garrett eventually inherited his family's Baltimore mansion, \"Evergreen,\" and subsequently moved some of the furnishings there. Evergreen eventually became Johns Hopkins University's Evergreen Museum & Library; its Warder pieces include a set of three Thomas Sheraton-inspired chairs and an ornately inlaid center table from the D.C. house's drawing room, and a handsome pair of possibly-architect-designed \"throne\" chairs carved with sunflowers, an ornate \"W,\" and the year 1887. \n\nOne of the Warder dining chairs is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n\n"}

After the Convention of the Metre had been signed in 1875, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sèvres, France made 28 prototype line standards of platinum-iridium. The bars had a cross section shaped like a modified letter X, designed by Tresca, called the \"Tresca section\". The Tresca section was designed to provide maximum stiffness. In addition, one surface of the central rib that joined the arms was designed to coincide with the bar's \"neutral plane\", the mathematical plane inside the bar that didn't change length when the bar bent. The two marks near each end of the bar which defined the meter were ruled on this surface. Thus, to first order, the distance between the marks wouldn't change due to the slight sagging of the bar under its own weight between support points. One of the bars was selected as the International Metre. The United States received National Prototype Metres No. 27 and No. 21 in 1890. When the Mendenhall Order in 1893 declared the meter to be the fundamental length standard, No. 27 became the US primary national standard for all length measurements. It remained so until 1960.\n\nTresca was made an honorary member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1882.\n\nTresca's stature as an engineer was such that Gustave Eiffel put his name on number 3 in his list of 72 people making the Eiffel tower in Paris possible.\n\n\n"}

The church is located at 414 Sparks Street in the northwest section of the city's downtown at the western end of Sparks Street on top of a promontory looking down to the Ottawa River.\n\nFrom time immemorial, the Algonquin heartland has included the entire length of the Ottawa River, from its headwaters in north-central Quebec to its outlet near Montreal. The parish of Christ Church Bytown, now Christ Church Cathedral Ottawa, was established on unceded Algonquin territory that had been settled by European colonists. What follows is a summary of various highlights and milestones of the cathedral's development in the post-settlement period.\n\nPhilemon Wright, a native of Woburn, Massachusetts, came to Canada in 1800. Making his way up the Ottawa River, and looking for a satisfactory place to settle, he finally came to the Chaudière Falls, and was pleased with the character of the land on the north side of the river, so he decided to settle there. In later years, the flourishing settlement of Wrightstown would become the village, then later the City of Hull, and finally the City of Gatineau. Following the War of 1812, the Township of March was set aside for retired military officers and men. It was situated further up river on the south side. In 1824, Nicholas Sparks crossed the river from then Hull and carved a home for himself out of the heavy timber on the high cliffs of the south shore. In doing so, he became the first citizen of what would later become Bytown, and much later, the City of Ottawa. Colonel John By and the Royal Engineers arrived two years later to build the Rideau Canal, connecting the Ottawa River with Lake Ontario.\n\nIn 1824, the Reverend Amos Ansley, a native Canadian and the son of a United Empire Loyalist, arrived in Hull from England. Sent by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, his mission included the Township of March, and in later years, Bytown. Services were held in a schoolhouse in Hull, which proved to be very small and inconvenient. Through the generosity of Philemon Wright, a little stone church was built, and opened on the first of October 1826. From his headquarters in Hull, Reverend Ansley served the Church population of fourteen townships bordering on the Ottawa River. By 1827, he was serving eleven preaching stations in Lower Canada (Quebec) and Upper Canada (Ontario), visiting most places by water in bark canoes.\n\nIn 1828, the Bishop of Quebec, the Right Reverend and Honourable Charles James Stewart, paid a visit to Bytown. Later that same year, the Venerable and Honourable John Strachan, an archdeacon and later the first Bishop of Toronto, also visited Bytown. The diaries of both these clergy record the fact that the Presbyterians, Roman Catholics and Methodists of Bytown were able to lay claim to small but significant places of worship to call their own; but those of the faith of the Church of England did not, \"...yet (were) sufficient to deserve the attention of a missionary.\" Archdeacon Strachan and the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada paid a visit to the home of Colonel By, situated in what is now called Major's Hill Park. There, they discussed the problems of funding the building of the canal, and need for a place of worship for the large Protestant following in Bytown. Later, on October 6, 1828, Dr. Strachan was able to draw up a subscription list for the proposed church building. It was not until early 1832, after it was announced at a meeting in Bytown that Nicholas Sparks had donated a site for the church. He had already given land for the building of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, as well as for the Methodist church. The original church building was to be fifty feet by thirty feet in breadth, the inside wall twenty feet high from the level of the beams to the top of the wall plate, and a tower erected at the west end of the church.\n\nThough formally established in 1832, it was not until 1833 that the congregation was formally organized. The site was donated by Nicholas Sparks in 1832. The first service in Christ Church Bytown took place on July 21, 1833. Due to decreased givings and pledges over the next two years, the parishioners found themselves seated on temporary rough planks for pews, and the walls and ceiling were not completed for a number of years. The Church had to be closed during the winter as two stoves were needed for sufficient heating, but only one was available. In spite of appeals, no funds were made available, and it was not until 1835 that the church finally owned its own property. By 1841, due to rapid growth in the population of Bytown, it was recognized that the church was not adequate in providing for the needs of the growing congregation. A proposed enlargement plan was drawn up, and Nicholas Sparks gave the additional land required for the enlargement. On July 12, 1841, the cornerstone was laid. Subscriptions were received from far and wide, and the enlargements were fully completed by October 1843. The church was consecrated and given its name - Christ's Church. Over the next quarter-century, a number of attempts were made to begin the building of a larger church. In 1860, Thomas Fuller (architect) designed a central school house for the congregation, which was demolished in 1872. \nIn 1861, Alexander Cowper Hutchinson (architect) designed a stone font inside the chapel, however the church was demolished in 1872. In 1865, a rectory was completed immediately west of the existing church building.\n\nIn January 1872, after many vestry and committee meetings, it was decided that a new church be constructed on the site of the old church. The last service in the old church was held on March 3, 1872, and demolition and reconstruction started immediately. The King McCord Arnoldi (architect) designed the new Christ Church Cathedral in an English Gothic style on the bluffs on Sparks Street near Bay Street, 1872-73 The cornerstone was laid July 3, 1872 with a timecapsule containing monetary denominations and other artifacts. The building was formally opened September 29, 1873 and the first service took place at 11:00 am that day. \n\nWalter Chesterton (architect) designed a new pulpit in 1880.\n\nAlfred Arthur Cox (architect) designed a new Sunday school and parish hall, 1902–03.\n\nIn 1896, the Diocese of Ottawa was carved out of the northern part of the Diocese of Ontario. The Right Reverend Charles Hamilton was elected as the first bishop of the new diocese. On Easter Day 1897, it was formally announced that Christ Church would become the cathedral of the new diocese.\n\nA memorial plaque is dedicated to Zachary Richard Edmund Lewis, of the North West Mounted Police and of \"D\" Co. 2nd Battery Royal Canadian Regiment who died 18 February, A.D. 1900 and his father Lewis, Esquire, M.D.\n\nA memorial plaque is dedicated to members of the congregation who died or served during the Great War. Erected by the 77th Overseas Battalion, C.E.F., and unveiled on June 11, 1916, a memorial plaque is dedicated to members of the Battalion who attended service at Christ Church Cathedral.\n\nMemorial plaques are dedicated to Lieutenant Ayton Richey Leggo, Eric Munro Anderson and to Lieutenant Edmund Brown, a chorister in the Cathedral who laid down his life for his friends on the fields of France during the Great War.\n\nErected by the Governor General's Foot Guards, a memorial 1916 Regimental Colour of the 77th Battalion (Ottawa), CEF \nis dedicated to the 77th Battalion (Ottawa), CEF.\n\nIn November 1931, a special meeting of Vestry unanimously agreed to begin the construction of a new chancel, extended to the street line of Queen Street. It was rebuilt in 1932 by King McCord Arnoldi, architect. An enlarged chancel was designed by A.J. Hazekgrove to mark its 50th Anniversary in 1932. The work of tearing down the old chancel began immediately after Easter 1932, and on December 22, 1932, a thanksgiving Eucharist was celebrated in the new largely expanded chancel. The completion of the new chancel marked 100 years since the establishment of the first church in Bytown.\n\nA memorial Queens Colour, 1874 Regimental Colour, and description text erected by members of the Regiment, was unveiled on 21 May 1933, and is dedicated to the Governor General's Foot Guards.\n\nErected by the Christ Cathedral, a memorial Sanctuary lamp and the lights in the chancel are dedicated to members of the Cathedral who died in WWII.\n\nErected by the Governor General's Foot Guards and unveiled on 4 October 1959, a memorial King's Colour and plaque at Christ Church Cathedral is dedicated to the Governor General's Foot Guards.\nErected by members of the Regiment, a memorial Queens Colour, Regimental Colour, and text was unveiled on 31 August 1969, and is dedicated to the 1st Battalion, The Canadian Guards. This Colour was presented by Governor General Vincent Massey, on 5 October 1957.\n\nThe Reredos was carved by the Rowley Family.\n\nA stained glass memorial window \"I am alive forevermore\" is dedicated to Major Robert Donaldson, Late HM 41st The Welsh Regiment and family members. Major Donaldson had died in December 1864.\n\nA stained-glass Memorial West Window, designed and installed by Christopher Wallis in 1982 depicts the cathedral's history, early French and English explorers in Bytown, and an ANIK-B satellite. The cathedral is regularly included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa, held annually in June.\n\nCurrently, the Right Reverend John Chapman serves as the Bishop of Ottawa. The Very Reverend Shane A. D. Parker serves as the Dean of Ottawa and the Rector of Christ Church Cathedral. The Reverend Canon Hilary Murray serves as the Pastoral Vicar. Christ Church Cathedral is a diverse parish with a wide range of ministries. It is a place where faith is nurtured in creative, traditional and thought-provoking ways. \nThe cathedral is frequently the site of diocesan, ecumenical, interfaith and state events, including the state funerals of Prime Ministers John Diefenbaker and Lester B. Pearson, Governors General Ray Hnatyshyn, Vincent Massey, and Roland Michener, and the Canadian funeral service of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\n\nSince the 1970s the cathedral has also been that of the Anglican Military Ordinariate of Canada and a seat in the Sanctuary is that of the Anglican Bishop Ordinary to the Canadian Forces. A plaque with those who have served in this capacity is above it. The present Bishop Ordinary is the Right Reverend Nigel Shaw.\n\nChrist Church Cathedral promotes excellence in sacred music and has an exceptional music ministry.\n\nThe Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys is the only remaining all-male choir in a Canadian Anglican cathedral. They continue to set a high standard of vocal repertoire and musicality, visiting the UK and France in recent years, and serving as the resident choir at Ely, Salisbury, Edinburgh, and St. Paul's cathedrals, and have just concluded a residency at Gloucester Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey. The choir has sung to acclaim in the United States on several occasions, most recently singing in St. Thomas' Church in New York City, and in Washington National Cathedral. The choir currently is made up of 24 boys, aged from 8 to 15, and 14 professional men.\n\nThe Cathedral Girls' Choir is, likewise, the only ensemble of its kind in a Canadian Anglican cathedral. In addition to its liturgical duties at home and participation in important civic and national events, the Choir has toured widely since its founding in 2002 including two European tours (2012 and 2016) and numerous visits to the United States (2010 and 2014). Its 25 members come from across Canada's Capital Region and range in age from 8-18.\n\nBeginning in 2018 the cathedral will augment its choir complement with a mixed-voice adult ensemble.\nThe Choirs share the singing of the principal weekly liturgies including Choral Eucharist on Sundays at 10:30, Evensong on Sundays at 4:30 and at major feast days.\n\nThroughout its history, the cathedral has been served by a number of eminent church musicians including Godfrey Hewitt, Frances Macdonnell and Matthew Larkin.\n\nJames Calkin is the director of music and organist and director of the Cathedral Girls' Choir. Andrew McAnerney is the associate director and principal conductor of the Choir of Men and Boys. Nicholas Walters serves as music associate.\n\nIn 2009, the cathedral purchased a Rodgers Trillium 958 as their primary organ, due to ongoing concerns about the effectiveness and disrepair of the Warren/Casavant organ (1891/1932/1948/1967/1995). Although there was controversy in the choice of a digital instrument, the organ is very versatile and tonally varied. In 2014, the \"en chamade\" trumpet stop (Casavant 1997) was restored to use, and an antiphonal division added. While the long-range plan of the cathedral has been to raise funds for a new pipe instrument in the future, the digital organ has proven to be a robust, effective instrument, capable of supporting a wide variety of recital and choral literature. As well, the Cathedral owns a 4-stop portative instrument (Karl Wilhelm, 1972).\n\n\nThe Dean of Ottawa is also Rector of Christ Church. An incomplete list of deans includes:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104577", "title": "Ruling gradient", "text": "Ruling gradient\n\nThe term ruling grade is usually used as a synonym for \"steepest climb\" between two points on a railroad. More simply, the steepest grade to be climbed dictates how powerful the locomotive must be (or how light the train) in order to complete the run without assistance. Even if 99% of the line could be run with a light (and inexpensive) locomotive, if at some point on the line there is a steeper gradient that a light engine would be unable to climb, this gradient \"rules\" that a more powerful (and expensive) locomotive must be used, in spite of it being far too powerful for the rest of the line. This is why special \"helper engines\" (also dubbed \"Bankers\") are often stationed near steep grades on otherwise mild tracks, because it is cheaper than running a too-powerful locomotive over the entire track mileage just in order to make the grade, especially when multiple trains run over the line each day.\n\nIn the 1953 edition of \"Railway Engineering\" William H. Hay says \"The ruling grade may be defined as the maximum gradient over which a tonnage train can be hauled with one locomotive...The ruling grade does not necessarily have the maximum gradient on the division. Momentum grades, pusher grades, or those that must regularly be doubled by tonnage trains may be heavier.\" This means the \"ruling grade\" may change if the management chooses to operate the railroad differently.\n\nOther things being equal, a train is harder to pull around a curve than it is on straight track because the wagons – especially bogie (2 axle) wagons – try to follow the chord of the curve and not the arc. To compensate for this, the gradient should be a little less steep the sharper the curve is; the necessary grade reduction is assumed to be given by a simple formula such as 0.04 per cent per \"degree of curve\", the latter being a measure of curve sharpness used in the United States. On a 10-degree curve (radius 573.7 feet) the grade would thus need to be 0.4% less than the grade on straight track.\n\nTunnels on steep gradients can present problems for air-breathing locomotives, such as steam locomotives and diesel locomotives. Poor ventilation in long or narrow tunnels can starve the locomotive of power. The solution is analogous to compensation for curvature and requires the gradient in the tunnel and for some distance on either side to be greatly reduced compared to the ruling grade. Unfortunately, the necessary compensation for gradient is not a simple equation, but is rather a trial and error process. Since one cannot build several tunnels to find out which one is best, it is useful to study existing tunnels with steep gradients.\n\nMoisture from exhausts and springs can also make the rails slippery, and allowance may need to be taken for that as well.\n\nIn steam days Southern Pacific trains eastward across Nevada and Utah faced nothing steeper than 0.43% in the 531 miles from Sparks to Ogden—except for a few miles of 1.4% east of Wells. Trains would leave Sparks with enough engine to manage the 0.43% grade (e.g. a 2-10-2 with 5500 tons) and would get helper engines at Wells; the \"ruling grade\" from Sparks to Ogden could be considered 0.43%. But nowadays the railroad doesn't base helper engines and crews at Wells so trains must leave Sparks with enough power to climb the 1.4%, making that the division's ruling grade.\n\nAs such, the term can be ambiguous; and is even more ambiguous if the ruling grade is impacted by the effect of a momentum grade. Overland Route trains from Sacramento, California to Oakland face nothing steeper than 0.5% on Track 1, the traditional westward track, but nowadays they might need to climb to the Benicia bridge on Track 2 which includes 0.7 mile at about 1.9%, preceded and followed by near-level track. Using this as an example, several issues arise on defining \"ruling grade\". One issue is whether a running start should be assumed and, if yes, the speed to assume. Another issue is the train length to assume, given that certain lengths exceed the length of the hill in question. And if a running start at some arbitrary speed is assumed, the calculated \"ruling grade\" will be different for locomotives having different power-vs-speed characteristics.\n\nIn North America, Congress set the Standard Grade for railroads eligible for subsidies and grants in the 1850s. They took as that standard the one adopted by the Cumberland – Wheeling Railway, that grade being 116 feet per mile. Later when charters were drawn up for the Union Pacific Railroad and the Canadian Pacific Railway in Canada, the national governments imposed the Standard Ruling Grade on the two lines because both received federal assistance and regulation. (Vance, JE Jr.,1995)\n\nA ruling grade is often found at a long climb up to a summit. Ideally, the cutting at the summit should be as deep as possible, such as at Shap, as this helps reduce the amount of climb and the steepness of the gradient. Alternately, a summit tunnel should be provided, such as at Ardglen.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2104580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104580", "title": "Thyroid cartilage", "text": "Thyroid cartilage\n\nThe thyroid cartilage is the largest of the nine cartilages that make up the \"laryngeal skeleton\", the cartilage structure in and around the trachea that contains the larynx. It does not completely encircle the larynx (only the cricoid cartilage encircles it).\n\nThe thyroid cartilage is a hyaline cartilage structure that sits in front of the larynx and above the thyroid gland. The cartilage is composed of two halves, which meet in the middle at a peak called the laryngeal prominence, also called the Adam's apple. In the midline above the prominence is the superior thyroid notch. A counterpart notch at the bottom of the cartilage is called the inferior thyroid notch.\n\nThe two halves of the cartilage that make out the outer surfaces extend obliquely to cover the sides of the trachea. The posterior edge of each half articulates with the cricoid cartilage inferiorly at a joint called the cricothyroid joint. The most posterior part of the cartilage also has two projections upwards and downwards. The upper projection is called the \"superior horn\" (), and the lower is called the \"inferior horn\". The superior horn is long and narrow, backward, and medialward, and ends in a conical extremity, which gives attachment to the lateral thyrohyoid ligament. The \"inferior horn\" is short and thick; it is directed downward, with a slight inclination forward and medialward, and presents, on the medial side of its tip, a small oval articular facet for articulation with the side of the cricoid cartilage.\n\nThe entire superior edge of the thyroid cartilage is attached to the hyoid bone by the thyrohyoid membrane. The thyroid cartilage is found between the levels of the C4 to C5 vertebrae.\n\nThe \"oblique line\" is a line on the thyroid cartilage. It marks the upper lateral borders of the thyroid gland. Two muscles originate along the line, the thyrohyoid muscle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor. The sternothyroid inserts along the line.\n\nMovement of the cartilage at this joint produces a change in tension at the vocal folds, which in turn produces variation in voice.\n\nThe thyroid cartilage forms the bulk of the front wall of the larynx. It protects the vocal folds (\"vocal cords\"), which are located directly behind it.\n\nWhen the angle of the thyroid cartilage changes relative to the cricoid cartilage, this changes the pitch of voice.\n\nThe cartilage also serves as an attachment for several muscles.\n\nThe English term \"thyroid cartilage\" is derived from the Latin expression \"cartilago thyreoides\". The latter is a translation of Ancient Greek χόνδρος θυρεοειδής, attested in the writings of the Greek physician Galen. The Latin word \"cartilago\", as well as the Ancient Greek word χόνδρος, both mean \"cartilage\", while the ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής means \"shield-like\" or \"shield-shaped\". The latter compound is composed of Ancient Greek θυρεός, \"shield\" and εἶδος, \"form\"/\"shape\". The Greeks used εἶδος in compounds to indicate a resemblance with the first part of the word.\n\nThe ancient Greek word θυρεός can be found in the \"Odyssey\" of Homer, and represented a large square stone that was put against the door to keep it shut. Those θυρεοί were eventually used by the Greek army as shields to protect themselves. This shield was adapted by Roman legions and referred to by them as a \"scutum\". The Roman \"scutum\" was an oblong shield with an oval shape. Numerous shields were used by the Roman soldiers, such as the \"pelta\", \"parma\" and \"clypeus\". In contrast to the \"scutum\", these shields were round. Despite these latter shields bearing a clear round shape, coinages like \"petalis cartilago\", \"cartilago parmalis\", and \"cartilago clypealis\" were coined for the thyroid cartilage. In 16th-century Italian anatomist Realdo Colombo's \"De re anatomica\", besides the aforementioned incorrect \"petalis cartilago\", correct forms like \"scutalis cartilago\" and \"scutiformis cartilago\" can be found, as the \"scutum\" is the real Roman pendant of the Greek θυρεός. The latter Latin expression can be found in its English form in medical dictionaries as \"scutiform cartilage\", while the name of the shield itself, i.e. \"scutum\", is still being mentioned as a synonym for the thyroid cartilage.\n\nIn the various editions of the official Latin nomenclature (\"Nomina Anatomica\", in 1998 rebaptized as \"Terminologia Anatomica\"), three different spellings can be found, i.e. \"cartilago thyreoidea\". \"cartilago thyroidea\" and the previously mentioned \"cartilago thyreoides\". The variant with the adjective \"thyreoidea\" (with the ending -ea) would be a faulty rendering of Ancient Greek θυρεοειδής in Latin. Greek compounds ending in -ειδής, when imported into Latin as a loanword, ended in -ides. In the 17th-century the non-classical Latin form -ideus/-idea/ideum for Greek -ειδής/-ειδές came into use, mostly by French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger. No Greek loanwords (originally -ειδής/-ειδές) ending in -ideus/-idea/-ideum exist in classical Latin, thereby making the -ideus/-idea/-ideum form non-Latinate in character. The first edition of the Jena Nomina Anatomica (\"JNA\") contained the incorrect \"cartilago thyreoidea\", but after a list of recommendations/corrections was made this was corrected in subsequent editions of the JNA.\n\nThe variant with \"thyroidea\" (omitting \"e\" after \"thyr\") is a compromise for English-speaking anatomists, as they have difficulties pronouncing that specific combination of letters, forcing a greater resemblance between Latin and English orthography. Dorland's medical dictionary from 1948 already adopted this incorrect spelling with an erroneous reference to the official Basle Nomina Anatomica even before the nomenclature committee of the Nomina Anatomica \"officially\" approved this orthographic revision in its edition of 1961. The spelling without an \"e\" is commonly accepted in English but earlier works preferred the etymologically correct \"thyreoid cartilage\". The official Latin veterinary nomenclature, \"Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria\" has the form \"cartilago thyroidea\", in common with the human Nomina Anatomica/Terminologia Anatomica, but allows (in contrast to the latter) \"cartilago thyreoidea\" as an alternative spelling.\nAn unfortunate mishap is the resemblance between Latin thyroidea and English thyroid on the one side and Ancient Greek θυροειδής on the other side, as the latter does not mean \"shield-like\", but actually means \"like a door\", derived from θύρα, door. Θυροειδής is however used in anatomic nomenclature in the expression θυροειδές τρῆμα (τρῆμα = hole, perforation, aperture), coined by the Greek physician Galen. Ancient Greek θύρα can be translated, besides the aforementioned \"door\", as \"gate\", \"entrance\" and \"opening\". The Greek name θυροειδές τρῆμα for this opening between the os pubis and the os ischii, currently called \"obturator foramen\", clearly originates from its being an opening (θύρα), while bearing no resemblance to a shield (θυρεός). The Latin translation \"foramen thyreoideum\" for θυροειδές τρῆμα by the 18th–19th-century German physician and anatomist Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring is clearly mistaken. The current \"foramen thyroideum\" of the \"Terminologia Anatomica\" is not a Latin translation of Galen's θυροειδές τρῆμα, but an orthographic revision of what was previously known in the Nomina Anatomica as \"foramen thyreoideum\", an inconstantly present opening in the lamina of the thyroid cartilage.\n\n"}

Furthermore, the Coalition holds that freedom of conscience, which includes religious freedom, was of such importance that it was made the first of all freedoms protected in the Bill of Rights, and that reason and science should be guiding tenets for public policy.\n\nThe mission of the Secular Coalition for America is to increase the visibility of and respect for nontheistic viewpoints in the United States and strengthen the secular character of our government as the best guarantee of freedom for all.\n\nThe Secular Coalition for America was founded in 2002 by four U.S. secular organizations: Atheist Alliance International, the Institute for Humanist Studies, the Secular Student Alliance, and the Secular Web. In 2005 the American Humanist Association became the Coalition's fifth member organization. The Society for Humanistic Judaism and the Freedom From Religion Foundation joined the Coalition in January 2006, the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers in February 2007, and the American Ethical Union in April 2008. In 2009, Camp Quest joined in January and American Atheists became a member in June. The Council for Secular Humanism joined in January 2010.\n\nCoalition president Herb Silverman was a leading force behind the founding of the organization, which was designed as a framework for cooperation among secular groups in the United States. Silverman believed that nontheistic Americans could gradually gain the respect of politicians and society if they collaborated on issues and presented a unified force for activism.\n\nThe Coalition's member organizations, as of 2018, are:\n\nThe Secular Coalition for America Board of Directors is democratically structured. Each sponsoring member organization appoints one individual to serve as its representative director, who casts one vote on any matter considered by the Board. Officers may be associated with member organizations or may come from the wider freethought community. Current officers are Herb Silverman, founder; Bob Kresek, president; Bill Norsworthy, vice president; Ron Lindsay, vice president; Alexander Satorie-Robinson, treasurer; Bonnie Cousens, secretary; John Levin; Madison Paige; Michael Trollan; Doug White.\n\nAdvisors to the Secular Coalition for America are Woody Kaplan (Chair), Rob Boston, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Rebecca Goldstein, Sam Harris, Jeff Hawkins, Wendy Kaminer, Michael Newdow, Dan Okrent, Steven Pinker, Salman Rushdie, Pete Stark, Todd Stiefel, and Julia Sweeney.\n\nThe Secular Coalition for America addresses issues arising out of what they see as the inappropriate presence of religion into public policy, such as government funding of religious ministries (the \"faith-based initiative\" or \"charitable choice\"); tuition vouchers for religious schools; federally funded abstinence-only sex education; limits to embryonic stem cell research; constitutional marriage protection amendments; access to birth control and emergency contraception; the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act; and the Pledge Protection Act as well as other court-stripping measures.\n\nThe Coalition is particularly active in challenging what it perceives as discrimination against nontheists by government chartered organizations like the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nSimilarly, it works to keep military chaplains from actively sharing their beliefs with service members.\nThe Coalition also welcomes and works in cooperation with religious groups regardless of affiliation when the religious group(s) share their beliefs of freedom of conscience and separation of church and state. The Secular Coalition for America espouses religious tolerance to people of all religions and those without.\n\nIn 2007 the Secular Coalition for America pledged a $1,000 reward to the person identifying the highest level elected official to openly acknowledge no supernatural beliefs. The \"Find an Atheist, Humanist, Freethinker Elected Official Contest\" concluded with the announcement that Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), a member of the United States Congress since 1973, held the highest office of four public servants to acknowledge a secular world view to the Coalition after being nominated by a contestant. Stark was the first Congressional member to publicly self-identify with the freethought community.\n\nOn February 26, 2010, the Secular Coalition for America, along with a unified delegation of members of the secular movement from across the country, met with representatives of the Obama administration for an official policy briefing—the first of its kind specifically for American non-theists. The group raised three particular areas of concern to secular Americans: military proselytizing and religious coercion, fixing the Faith-Based Initiatives program, and ending the exemptions granted to religious groups in laws governing child medical abuse and neglect.\n\nThe Secular Coalition for America publishes an online Congressional scorecard rating U.S. Representatives and Senators on their roll call votes and legislative sponsorship.\n"}

Originally a law student at the University of Santiago de Compostela, he enlisted in the Spanish army and went to Peru in 1817 as one of the commissioned officers in the fight against the pro-independence nationalist forces. He also served as Prime Minister of Spain from 17 June 1842 to 9 May 1843.\n\nHe led the Carabineros Corps, established by a royal decree issued by King Fernando VII in 1829 at the time that Luis López Ballesteros was Minister of Finance.\n\nIn 1824 after Ayacucho disaster, Rodil assumed command of the last Spanish stronghold on Peruvian territory, Callao port city. Besieged by nationalist forces backed by Simón Bolívar, Rodil refused to surrender, even as scurvy and starvation wreaked havoc among the hundreds of loyalists living in the fort. Even his top lieutenants began turning against him, only for Rodil to execute them by firing squad. He even executed his chaplain, Pedro Marieluz, for not revealing to him the details of the confessions made by those sentenced to death.\n\nThe Patriots, despairing at the resistance of the Spaniards, threatened reprisals against the defenders of Callao but were countermanded by Bolívar: \"\"Heroism does not merit punishment. How we would applaud Rodil if he were a patriot!\"\". Nevertheless, in the long run, resistance proved futile; two of Rodil's trusted comrades who commanded other forts nearby, and their forces, jumped to the nationalist side, thus revealing Rodil's potential defensive plans. On January 22, 1826, Rodil surrendered to Venezuelan general Bartolome Salom and was allowed to go back to Spain.\n\nBack in Spain, Rodil was more respected than his other Army colleagues, such as José de la Serna and José de Canterac, who had been defeated in the earlier Battle of Ayacucho. After Ferdinand VII's death, he supported Isabella II in the civil war against the Carlists. He later was viceroy of Navarra, which wasn't yet fully incorporated in the Spanish kingdom, and was President of the Government of Spain in 1842. He had a personal rivalry with Baldomero Espartero, Count of Luchana, who had attempted to divest him of his military honors. Rodil then retired from Spanish politics, and died at age 64.\n"}
{"id": "2104591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104591", "title": "Hugo Danner", "text": "Hugo Danner\n\nHugo Danner is a fictional character and the protagonist of Philip Wylie's 1930 novel \"Gladiator\". Born in the late 19th century with superhuman abilities via prenatal chemical experimentation, Danner tries to use his powers for good, making him a precursor of the superhero. However, Danner grows disillusioned with his inability to find a permanent outlet for his great strength, and dies frustrated.\n\nApart from Wylie's novel, the character has also appeared in a feature film and publications by Marvel Comics and DC Comics. Comedic actor Joe E. Brown portrayed him in a 1938 movie adaptation of the book. Decades later the character starred in an adaptation titled \"Man-God\" in Marvel's black-and-white comics-magazine \"Marvel Preview\" #9 (Winter 1976). He next appeared in DC's standard color comic book \"Young All-Stars\" in 1988 and 1989, as the estranged father of an illegitimate son named Iron Munro. In 2005, he returned in the comic-book miniseries \"Legend\", published by the DC imprint Wildstorm. Here Danner, in the late 1960s, fights as a U.S. Army supersoldier in the Vietnam War rather than as a super Legionnaire in World War I.\n\nIn early February 1930, Wylie described the inspiration for Danner's creation in the introduction to one of the earliest printings of \"Gladiator\":\nThe novel begins during the closing years of the 19th century, as Colorado science Professor Abednego Danner searches for a way to improve the innate weaknesses of human biology and create a new \"race that doesn't know fear — because it cannot know harm\". After 14 years of research he finally discovers \"alkaline radicals\" that vastly improve \"muscular strength and the nervous discharge of energy\". Following very successful animal testing, which yields super-strong tadpoles and a bulletproof kitten capable of taking down cattle as prey, he injects this super-serum into the womb of his pregnant wife, Matilda. Hugo Danner is born on Christmas several months later.\n\nHis parents imbue him with a strong moral compass during his formative years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as an outsider in the eyes of the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.\n\nDanner leaves Colorado after graduating high school to attend Webster University. There, he becomes an unstoppable football star and the most popular boy in school. During the summer months, he works as a circus strong man and even enters a fight competition for money. However, after returning to college and accidentally killing another player during a game, he quits school and becomes a sailor. A year later, his ship is trapped in France by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\nHe and a fellow American sign up with the French Foreign Legion and find themselves on the battlements after a short training period. He eventually reveals his powers to his Legionnaire superiors, who believe him to be a devil or supernatural Native American, and he is given free rein to roam the battlefield and kill as many German soldiers as he possibly can. Stories of \"Le Colorado\" (The Colorado) quickly spread from trench to trench and Danner becomes a sort of mythical hero. After a short stint in an American Legionnaire unit, Danner grows weary of war and devises a plan with an airplane:\n\nHowever, the Treaty of Versailles is signed the very day he prepares to leave, and so he is forced to abort his mission, much to his dismay. He returns to the United States and works in a number of professions — steel mill worker, bank teller, farm hand, and disarmament lobbyist — but his unique stature among mortal men forever brings him grief. He eventually offers his services to a noted history professor preparing a Mayan archaeological dig and travels with the group to the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nDuring the trip, Danner wonders if the Mayans and Egyptians had discovered the same formula as his father, \"which could be poured into the veins of the slaves [who built the pyramids], making them stronger than engines\". There, he works as the head steward of the hired Mayan helpers and proves himself an asset to the team. But when a mishap reveals his great strength to the professor, the elderly man suggests Danner use his father's formula to create a new race of men known as the \"Sons of Dawn\", who will use their powers to right the world's wrongs. The idea appeals to him at first, but Danner fears that these sons would also be hated by humanity for their superiority and treated much the same as himself. In the end, he climbs a mountain amidst an oncoming thunderstorm, and is struck dead by lightning while praying to God. The formula is lost in the resulting fire. The professor discovers his charred remains three days later and buries him among the Mayan ruins.\n\nEven during his early years, Danner displays superhuman strength. He demolishes his wooden crib as a newborn, saves a man's life by lifting a two-ton supply wagon at 6 years old, and uproots entire trees at 10. He progressively grows stronger as he gets older. During his twenties, he can stop and kill a charging bull with a single punch, bend a railroad rail, lift a seventy-five millimeter howitzer cannon singlehandedly, lift a car and its driver singlehandedly, rip open a bank vault, and easily catch a falling 8,000-pound block of stone.\n\nDanner's physical strength extends to his legs, allowing him to leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap into the air and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While in the service of the French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about ); all while carrying of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.\n\nHe first learns of his body's superior resistance to physical injury during the war. Bullets and bayonets glance off his tough skin. He believes he can even survive a plane crash. The only weaponry capable of penetrating his skin at the time are the largest artillery shells. Although, he still feels the effects of the elements, sweating under the heat of the sun and freezing during winter. Danner's only vulnerability is lightning, which ultimately kills him.\n\nDanner's bodily tissues have a somewhat greater density than those of an ordinary human being. Though he has an athletic build, his strength is far greater than what his frame would naturally allow. People guess him to be , but he actually weighs . During his stint as a sailor, he goes pearl diving with the natives of Cristobal and is able to dive deeper and stay under longer because of his density.\n\nHis body can heal damaged tissue much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human can. He collapses from exhaustion and wounds sustained from artillery shells after he goes berserk against the Germans to avenge a friend's death. When he wakes up in an army hospital, he finds \"his wounds had healed without the necessity of a single stitch\". Long periods of comatose sleep (up to 20 hours) and the consuming of huge meals also aid in his regenerative process.\n\nDanner was portrayed by comedic actor Joe E. Brown in the 1938 film \"The Gladiator\", which loosely adapted science-fiction drama as a comedy, and, among the many changes, renamed the protagonist \"Hugo Kipp\". The film begins when Kipp wins a large sum of money in a contest and decides to return to college. There, he is talked into joining the football team and fails to live up to his athletic father's legendary reputation. But after a Professor Danner (Lucien Littlefield) injects Kipp with a serum that gives him superhuman strength, he becomes an unstoppable player and wins the heart of the self-centered quarterback's girlfriend (June Travis). In the end, he faces Man Mountain Dean in a wrestling match, but the serum runs out at the last minute.\n\nIn comics, Danner first appeared in the 52-page story \"Man-God\", by writer Roy Thomas and artist Tony DeZuniga (credited as Antony DeZuniga) in Marvel Comics' \"Marvel Preview\" #9 (Winter 1976). Only the first half of the novel is adapted.\n\nDanner next appeared in DC Comics' \"Young All-Stars\" #9-11 (Feb.-April 1988) and #28-31 (Aug.-Nov. 1989), as the estranged father of Iron Munro, his illegitimate son. Munro was not a character or even a possibility in the original novel, where, as Danner's ailing scientist father explained, \"the effect of the process is not inherited by the future generations. It must be done over each time\".\n\nIn this storyline, Munro comes into possession of his father's diary and learns of Danner's troubled life as the 20th century's first metahuman. After having read the diary, Munro turns to the government's secret Project M, demanding to know the location of the \"Dinosaur Island\" mentioned by Danner. There he meets a person who leads him instead to Maple White Land in South America. Munro is surprised when he finds his father is alive. Danner apparently faked his death in the Yucatan and briefly returned home to have a one-night stand with his former high school sweetheart Anna Blake. The resulting union bore Munro, who took his surname from his mother's new husband (who believed the child to be his own). Danner has, by this time, succeeded in rearing the first generation of the Sons of Dawn. He later reveals to the Young-All Stars that the villain Übermensch has stolen the formula in order to create his own race of supermen.\n\nMunro is forced to oppose his father when Danner orders the Sons of Dawn to attack a Brazilian city. The combined might of the All-Star Squadron defeats the Sons of Dawn and Danner is killed during the final battle.\n\nDanner starred in the four-issue miniseries \"Legend\" (April–July 2005) by writer Howard Chaykin and artist Russ Heath, published by the DC imprint Wildstorm. Cover blurbs on the first two issues read, \"Inspired by Philip Wylie's Novel \"Gladiator\"\". The story now takes place in the second half of the 20th century, with the Vietnam War replacing World War I, but the story remaining for the most part intact.\n\nNo confirmation exists that Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel was influenced by \"Gladiator\". He and co-creator Joe Shuster began developing Superman in 1934.\n\nSuperman as originally published came from an unnamed planet whose inhabitants were millions of years more evolved than humans. When they reached maturity, \"the people of his race became gifted with titanic strength\". Their advanced evolution and great strength accounted for Superman's superhuman abilities on earth. As Siegel described them: \"When maturity was reached, he discovered he could easily: leap of a mile; hurdle a twenty-story building...raise tremendous weights...run faster than an express train...and that nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin!\"\n\nSiegel and Shuster compared Superman's strength and leaping abilities to those of an ant and a grasshopper, respectively, as did Abednego for his son. Danner also claims descent from a far-off land (Colorado) inhabited by a race of super-strong, indestructible men. In order to keep his true \"experimental\" origins a secret, he tells his Legionnaire superiors, \"[Colorado is a] place in America. A place that has scarcely been explored. I was born there. All the men of Colorado are born as I was born and are like me. We are very strong. We are great fighters. We cannot be wounded except by the largest shells.\" Other examples of similarities include both of their biological fathers are scientists (Jor-El and Abednego), both grow up in rural settings (Smallville and Indian Creek, Colorado), both are imbued with a strong moral compass from a young age both lift cars over their heads, and both hide their powers from the world.\n\nOne critic noted that Danner's \"creation and upbringing by a scientist father recall Doc Savage's origins\" and a \"prototype for the famous scene in which the fledgling Spider-Man defeats a hulking wrestler to make money is found in Wylie's novel; Hugo's bout in the ring is similar to that in the Spider-Man's origin story in 1962's \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2104596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104596", "title": "Rendition (company)", "text": "Rendition (company)\n\nRendition was a maker of 3D computer graphics chipsets in the mid to late 1990s. They were known for products such as the Vérité 1000 and Vérité 2x00 and for being one of the first 3D chipset makers to directly work with \"Quake\" developer John Carmack to make a hardware-accelerated version of the game (vQuake). Rendition's major competitor at the time was 3Dfx. Their proprietary rendering APIs were Speedy3D (for DOS) and RRedline (for Windows).\n\nReleased in 1996, Rendition's V1000 chipset was notable for its RISC-based architecture. The V1000 was the first PC graphics card to utilize a programmable core to render 3D graphics. V1000 was both faster and more advanced (in terms of features) than competitors such as the Matrox Millennium, ATI Rage/3D, and S3 Virge3D. Only 3DFX's Voodoo Graphics was faster, but unlike the 3DFX Voodoo, the V1000 included 2D/VGA capability making it the only acceptably fast single-board solution for 3D games.\n\nVérité supported a local framebuffer of up to 4 MB EDO DRAM, on a 64-bit bus (for a theoretical 400 MB/s bandwidth). Aside from 3D games, Vérité contained an IBM VGA compatible display controller, and served as a traditional 2D/GUI accelerator for the Windows operating system.\n\nVérité's first claim to fame was being the only accelerator supported by \"Quake\". Board partner Number Nine Visual Technology later canceled their Vérité products. In the book Masters of Doom, Carmack cited bad experiences with programming the Vérité as the reason for id's shift away from proprietary APIs toward the industry-standard OpenGL.\n\nThe V1000 was fairly popular when it was launched. At least four companies sold Vérité boards: the Creative Labs 3D Blaster PCI, the Sierra Screamin' 3D, the Canopus Total 3D, and the Intergraph Reactor (later renamed Intense 3D 100). A handful of software titles shipped with V1000 support. As the ATI Rage/3D, S3 Virge/3D, and Matrox Mystique delivered 3D/graphics of questionable benefit, id Software's vQuake and Eidos's Tomb Raider were influential in fueling consumer interest in 3D rendering hardware. The Vérité (and Voodoo) ports added 16-bit color rendering, bilinear filtering, per-polygon MIP mapping, and edge anti-aliasing to the game's 3D visuals. Released in time for Christmas 1996, both vQuake and Tomb Raider demonstrated the V1000's 3D/hardware to be both faster and better-looking than software rendering on even the most powerful host CPU.\n\nAn interesting piece of V1000's technology was its use of bus master DMA transfers for data transfer across the PCI bus. This allowed the board to transfer data much more efficiently than with the alternative FIFO mode of the bus. Unfortunately, the immaturity of the PCI bus at the time, and the limited use of bus mastering in general in systems of the day, caused DMA bugs to surface with Vérité. If a motherboard chipset wasn't capable of DMA, Vérité was forced to operate in FIFO mode and performance dropped dramatically. Additionally, on some motherboards, DMA support was incomplete or improperly implemented and speed was quite poor. Both of these issues combined to cause frequent problems for owners of the V1000. Rendition had a DMA test utility to benchmark a motherboard's support of DMA transfers. Some DOS games with Speedy3D Vérité support, such as IndyCar Racing II, offered a mode using DMA and a mode using FIFO, in order to bypass these issues.\n\nThe Vérité performed triangle setup in hardware. Rendition frequently touted its setup engine as an advantage against 3Dfx's Voodoo Graphics, because hardware setup reduced the host CPU's processing requirements for drawing complex 3D scenes. Unfortunately, the Vérité's 3D/engine lacked the necessary fill rate to capitalize on this advantage; the V1000's pixel fill rate was, at best, roughly 25Mpixels/second (little more than half that of the Voodoo Graphics.) Design limitations prevented V1000 from sustaining that level in many games (e.g. when the software uses z-buffering). While the Voodoo did become the accelerator of choice for high-budget 3D/gamers, the V1000's triangle setup and integrated 2D/VGA core attracted many gamers looking to upgrade on a modest budget.\n\nOutside of 3D games, V1000's (2D) performance was subpar in almost every way. On the extreme, in regular MCGA/VGA resolution or \"Mode X\", the V1000's performance was embarrassingly slow; older MS-DOS games (such as \"Doom\") ran at near slideshow speeds, even on a top-of-the-line host CPU (Pentium 166 MHz). Rendition introduced \"renutil\", an MS-DOS utility, to address performance in MCGA graphics mode. The utility redirected MCGA (VGA-compatible) display mode setup to an equivalent VESA display mode, bypassing the Vérité's slow VGA core. The utility worked with all MCGA games, but was completely incompatible with games using \"Mode X\" VGA display mode, which could not be emulated using the VESA mode. Within Windows 95, the V1000 was passable, scoring neither top nor bottom in ZDnet's benchmark suite. In VESA VBE 2.0 display mode, Vérité's speed was outstanding, comparable to other top-rated cards of the era (such as the Matrox and ARK Logic PCI VGA chipsets.)\n\nWhile Rendition had tried to craft the V1000 to support many application programming interfaces (APIs), these APIs were in their infancy at the time. For example, Microsoft's Direct3D standard was in rapid development with major changes occurring. V1000 was not optimized for this new Direct3D standard. However, this was more the fault of the API because Direct3D, at the time, lacked support for DMA transfers. The design of V1000, with its RISC core, was one of programmability. Because the GPU was not \"hardwired\" as ASICs are, the chip could potentially adapt to newer or differing standards than it was initially designed for. Performance limitations, however, inevitably dictated that the chip was not able to grow significantly. OpenGL support, for example, was very limited on V1000.\n\nRendition's 2nd generation architecture consisted of the Vérité V2100 and V2200. The chips were refined versions of the V1000 technology, most notably offering a single-cycle pixel computation (the V1000 took more than a single clock cycle to calculate each pixel). This boosted the chips' fill rate nearly twofold, and combined with faster memory and a slightly faster core clock rate, offered performance modestly ahead of 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics (the benchmark of the time).\n\nThese two chips were identical in every way other than clock speed, with the V2100 being used as a \"value\"-oriented chip. V2100 was typically clocked at 40-45 MHz, while V2200 was typically seen at 55-60 MHz. The V2100 only saw implementation on one board, the Diamond Multimedia Stealth II S220 PCI with 4 MB SGRAM, which was offered at $100 initially but quickly dropped to $50 due to limited demand. The Stealth II even received a BIOS update later in its life to up the clock speed of the V2100 to the same level as a V2200, as an attempt to boost interest in the card. The V2200 was seen on several cards, most notably the Hercules Thriller 3D offered in both AGP and PCI formats, with 4 MB or 8 MB SGRAM. V2200 offered a 55 megapixel/second fillrate with all of the features expected of a 3D accelerator at the time. Additions to the 2D and video acceleration improved performance and allowed hardware acceleration of DVD playback. The new chips were designed for Microsoft Windows 9x and NT 4.\n\nRendition and Hercules were at one point cooperating on a \"Thriller Conspiracy\" project which combined a Fujitsu FXG-1 \"Pinolite\" geometry processor with a V2200 core to create a graphics card with a full transform and lighting (T&L) engine years before Nvidia's GeForce 256 or ATI's Radeon 7000. This board, designed to further reduce the load placed upon the system's CPU, never made it to market. Rumors spread that it was to be launched during Summer 1998, with a 9 MB board (1 MB for the Pinolite) costing $149 USD. Preliminary benchmarks showed very consistent performance regardless of the system's CPU speed. Unfortunately, by the time it would have launched, there were far more powerful accelerators available, such as NVIDIA's RIVA TNT and 3Dfx's Voodoo 2, that would have significantly overshadowed this board. photo\n\nOne of the most peculiar graphics boards ever made was part of the V2200 family. The Jazz Multimedia Outlaw 3D \"Bonny & Clyde\" combined both an AGP and a PCI connector on the same board. To use one or the other the user simply flipped the card and metal edge bracket over and plugged it in.\n\nThe V3300 is Rendition's third generation 3D graphics chipset. It would have been manufactured on a 0.35 μm process at IBM and would have replaced the V2200 as Rendition's high-end chipset in early 1999. This chipset was never released. After several delays, in 1998 Rendition was purchased by Micron Technology and the project was cancelled.\n\n\nWith its acquisition by Micron in 1998, Rendition had hoped to take advantage of Micron's embedded DRAM technology. After the setbacks to the V3300 project, and its eventual cancellation due to delays, Rendition came back with promises for a V4400 chip in 2000. This new chip was purported to have 125 million transistors mostly used by 12 MB of embedded memory, a stunning level of complexity for the day. Although this embedded memory design was later used in Micron's AMD Athlon chipset codenamed \"Mamba\", the actual graphics chip never surfaced.\n\nPreviewed Micron \"SuperChip2\" motherboard chipset specifications:\n\nRendition built a thorough list of supported games by encouraging developers large and small to make use of their free APIs. Rendition originally provided developers with Speedy3D, a DOS-based API, as most game development in 1995-96 was still centered on DOS. Later, Rendition released their Win32 version of the API, branded RRedline. Like 3Dfx, Rendition was one of the first 3D chipset makers to see the value of homebrew programming by releasing a free programming API to the public. In much the same manner as 3Dfx, Rendition also hosted a programming competition called \"Take it to the RRedline\" to allow homebrew programmers to show off their abilities (as well as Rendition's product).\n\nNotable game titles with native Rendition API support included; Descent II, Grand Prix Legends, IndyCar Racing II, the Myth games, Sierra's NASCAR, Quake, Quake II, EF2000 V2.0, EF2000 with Graphics+/TACTCOM patch and Tomb Raider.\n\nRendition was one step behind other competitors coming to market at a pivotal time in the 3D PC graphics engines battle. The NVIDIA RIVA 128 came to market in late 1997. The V2100 saw first silicon in early 1997, but was late to sample due to a digital cell library bug necessitating a respin. Rendition used the libraries developed by SiArch (licensed through Synopsys at that time) for their digital logic synthesis. A critical section of circuitry happened to synthesize into a 3 input nor-gate driving a scanned flip-flop. Apparently this combination was never \"spiced\" (simulated in a program such as SPICE) by SiArch. The scan-flop had three passive transmission gate muxes driven by the three n-type transistors in the NOR3, all in series. The result of this was excessive resistance with a weak bus-hold cell, which ate into the allowable noise margin and violated the static discipline in good digital logic design. This manifests itself as an intermittent bug that is seen in the lab but not in high level behavioral or even RTL or gate-level simulations. This root cause was only determined after months of investigation, simulations, and test case development in the lab, which narrowed the problem to a very confined space. At that point, the chip was run live under a scanning electron microscope using the oscilloscope probe mode to find the problem net between the NOR3 gate and the scan-flop. The combination was then spiced and confirmed to be the culprit. Two full quarters were lost due to this bug. Despite these delays, the V2x00 shipped with fully conformant OpenGL and D3D drivers.\n\nThe company was eventually purchased by Micron, who kept the development team intact as a source of embedded graphics solutions for their own line of motherboards.

Powered by a straight-six engine, it was produced from 1967 until 1972, eventually being phased out in favour of the Aston Martin V8.\n\nIt was a larger coupé than the DB6, with four full sized seats, but was powered by the same 4.0 L engine as the previous car. Claimed engine output was , but a \"Vantage\" engine option used Italian made Weber carburettors, increasing output to an advertised .\n\nIn 1966, Touring of Milan was commissioned to design the DB6 replacement and produced two prototypes before the design house went out of business. The DB6 was incapable of accommodating the planned V8-engine and had to be replaced. William Towns was then hastily brought in to design the new car. The DBS was intended to have a more \"modern\" look than the previous series of Aston models (the DB4 through DB6), and it incorporated a fastback style rear end and squared off front grille, atypical of Astons at the time but very much then in vogue in automotive design circles of the late sixties. Trademark Aston design features, such as a bonnet scoop, knock-off wire wheels with 815X15 Crossplys or 205VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN72 Radial Tyres, and side air vents with stainless steel brightwork were however retained. The DBS was the last Aston Martin to be developed under David Brown's control.\n\nIn September 1969 the DBS was made available with the 5340 cc V8 engine for which it was always intended, this variant being known as the DBS V8. At the time, it was the fastest four-seater production car in the world. The new model was fitted with light alloy wheels (as opposed to wire wheels on the DBS) and ventilated brake discs. Automatic transmission was offered as an alternative to the ZF 5-speed manual gearbox. The DBS V8 was produced until May 1972, after which it was given a single headlamp front end and was renamed simply the Aston Martin V8.\n\nIn 1969 the Lagonda name was briefly resurrected, appearing on a four-door prototype of the DBS model. The prototype was allocated chassis MP230/1 and was retained by the factory until 1972 and used by Sir David Brown as his personal car, registered JPP 5G. The car originally ran a prototype 5-litre V8 engine but this was quickly replaced by an early 5.3-litre production quad carb version (VS4008EE).\n\nBetween 1974 and 1976, seven Lagonda four-door saloons were produced based on the 1969 prototype. The production models adopted a single-headlight treatment with a Lagonda \"horseshoe\" grille in place of the twin-headlamp treatment of the prototype.\n\nThe DBS was used by George Lazenby's James Bond in the 1969 film \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". Unlike Bond's previous car, the Aston Martin DB5, no gadgets were seen in this car, other than a mounting for a telescopic-sight rifle in the glove compartment. In the final scenes of the film, Bond's wife, Tracy, is shot and killed whilst sitting in the car.\n\nA second DBS also appears in a brief single scene in the next Bond film, \"Diamonds are Forever\". It can be seen in the background being fitted with small missiles at Q Branch whilst Bond is talking to Q on the telephone.\n\nAnother DBS was later used in the TV series \"The Persuaders!\" (1971–1972), in which Roger Moore's character Lord Brett Sinclair drove a distinctive \"Bahama Yellow\" 6-cylinder DBS (chassis number DBS/5636/R) that, through the use of alloy wheels and different badges, had been made to look like the DBS V8 model. Supplied by Aston Martin to the show's producers, the car used the personalised number plate \"BS 1\" (except for one scene in the episode \"The Gold Napoleon,\" where the car has its original UK registration number PPP 6H instead), courtesy of the plates real owner Billy Smart, Jr. Sold by the factory after filming ended, via HR Owen in London, to its first private owner. It was restored to a very high standard in recent years by the Aston Martin factory, and is presently owned by divorce lawyer and noted art collector Jeremy Levison. Moore and co-star Tony Curtis both signed the underside of the car's boot lid (rear luggage compartment): Moore at Pinewood Studios in May 2003; Curtis at Cheltenham Racecourse in October 2008. In 2013 the Aston Martin DBS was an invited participant at two of Europe's most exclusive motoring concours, the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este at Lake Como, and the Salon Privé Concours in London.\n\nKenneth Haigh as Joe Lampton drove one in the tv series (1) ‘Man at the Top’ (1970)\n\nThe restoration of an original DBS, registration JRA615H was featured in the first episode of series 2 of the Channel 4 series \"For the Love of Cars\", screened in April 2015. The process took over 6,000 man-hours. During restoration, it was upgraded to Vantage specification which included conversion from an automatic to manual gearbox. It sold at auction with Coys of Kensington for £169,800 .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104622", "title": "Third-party standing", "text": "Third-party standing\n\nThird party standing is a term of the law of civil procedure that describes when one party may file a lawsuit or assert a defense in which the rights of third parties are asserted. In the United States, this is generally prohibited, as a party can only assert his or her own rights and cannot raise the claims of right of a third party who is not before the court. However, there are several exceptions to this doctrine.\n\nFor example, a third party may sue where he has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, as in the case of a bookseller suing to enforce the rights of his patrons to purchase a particular book from his store.\n\nA third party may assert the rights of another person in order to vindicate them when the other person is unable to do so. For example, the US Supreme Court has held that a white person bound by a restrictive covenant not to sell realty to a black person may assert the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment rights of black persons not before the court.\n\nA party that represents a class in a certified class action suit may continue to represent the class even where their own stake in the suit has dissipated. A woman seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a law that prevents divorcees from remarrying within a year may continue to represent the class of similarly situated persons, even if the year passes and she is able to remarry before the case has been decided.\n\nOrdinarily, one may not claim standing in a court to vindicate the constitutional rights of some third party. The requirement of standing is often used to describe the constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"cases\" and \"controversies.\" Apart from the jurisdictional requirement, the US Supreme Court has developed a complementary rule. one of self-restraint for its own governance. which ordinarily precludes a person from challenging the constitutionality of state action by invoking the rights of others. The common thread underlying both requirements is that a person cannot challenge the constitutionality of a statute unless he shows that he himself is injured by its operation.\n\nExamples of application of this rule are:\n\n\nThere are recognized exceptions to the general rule in cases where the party whose rights are being invoked is not in a position to assert those right effectively. At times, \"it would be difficult if not impossible for the persons whose rights are asserted to present their grievance before any court.\" In such cases the courts often allow third parties vicariously to vindicate the rights of a non-litigant rights possessor.\n\nIn \"Pierce v. Society of Sisters\", a state statute required all parents to send their children to public schools. A private and a parochial school brought suit to enjoin enforcement of the act on the ground that it violated the constitutional rights of parents and guardians. No parent or guardian to whom the act applied was a party or before the Court. The Court nonetheless held that the statute was unconstitutional because it \"unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\" The schools were thus permitted to assert in defense of their property rights the constitutional rights of the parents and guardians.\n\nIn \"Barrows v. Jackson\", Jackson owned a house in Los Angeles the deed to which contained a covenant against selling to Negroes. Jackson breached the covenant by selling to a Negro and Barrows sued. The courts ruled against enforcement despite Barrows's argument that Jackson was asserting the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights of persons not before the court. The Court said:\n\nThe relation between the coercion exerted on respondent [Jackson] and her possible pecuniary loss thereby is so close to the purpose of the restrictive covenant, to violate the constitutional rights of those discriminated against, that respondent is the only effective adversary of the unworthy covenant in its last stand. She will be permitted to protect herself and, by so doing, close the gap to the use of this covenant, so universally condemned by the courts.\n\nIn \"NAACP v. Alabama\", the state had obtained a court order requiring the NAACP to produce membership lists. Upon its refusal to comply, the NAACP was held in contempt. The Supreme Court reversed, permitting the NAACP to assert the rights of its members and holding that the state court order violated their First Amendment right of freedom of association. The Court noted that because litigation by individual NAACP members would require disclosure of their identity and thus destroy the freedom of association threatened by the court order, the NAACP was a proper party to act on the members' behalf to assert their constitutional rights.\n\nIn \"Griswold v. Connecticut,\" a doctor and a birth control official who had distributed contraceptives were prosecuted under an aiding and abetting statute as accessories to the crime of using birth control devices. The Court permitted the defendants to assert the privacy rights of the third-party contraceptives recipients because of the professional relationship between the defendants and the third parties, and because the recipients' rights would be diluted were the defendants not allowed to assert them.\n\nIn \"Craig v. Boren\", a liquor vendor and a young man challenged the constitutionality of an Oklahoma statute that prohibited the sale of 3.2% beer to males under 21 years of age and females under 18 years of age. The Court held that the liquor vendor, subject to sanctions and loss of license for violation of the statute, was a proper party in interest to object to the enforcement of the allegedly discriminatory law, because obedience to the law would cause loss of sales and disobedience risked sanctions from the state. \"Accordingly,\" the Court explained, \"vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function.\" It is crucial to the vendor's standing that its failure to prevail in the litigation \"will materially impair the ability of males 18-20 years of age to purchase 3.2% beer despite their classification by an overt gender-based criterion.\"\n\nIn general, these cases require the person asserting a third party's rights to be injured in some way by the rights violation. In \"Barrows\", it was being required to pay damages for violating the racial covenant; in \"NAACP\", contempt; in \"Griswold\", criminal prosecution as an aider and abettor. In cases where no such injury is threatened, the courts tend to deny standing.\n\nIn \"Kowalski v. Tesmer\", the Court denied standing to Michigan attorneys who sued to challenge state law that restricted appointment of appellate counsel for indigent defendants who had pleaded guilty. The attorneys asserted that the indigent defendants' constitutional rights were being denied. The Court said that its cases had held that a party seeking third-party standing must make two showings:\n\nFirst, we have asked whether the party asserting the right has a \"close\" relationship with the person who possesses the right. Second, we have considered whether there is a \"hindrance\" to the [rights] possessor's ability to protect his own interests.\n\nThe attorneys in this case invoked the potential attorney-client relationship to demonstrate the requisite closeness\"\n\nSpecifically, they rely on a future attorney-client relationship with as yet unascertained Michigan criminal defendants \"who will request, but be denied, the appointment of appellate counsel, based on the operation\" of the statute. . . . The attorneys before us do not have a \"close relationship\" with their alleged \"clients\"; indeed, they have no relationship at all.\n\nThe Court also ruled that it perceived no hindrance to the indigent defendants' asserting their constitutional rights for themselves. The attorneys argued that, without counsel, unsophisticated, \"pro se\" criminal defendants could not \"coherently advance the substance of their constitutional claim.\" The Court rejected that claim. It said that \"we do not think that the lack of an attorney here is the type of hindrance necessary to allow another to assert the indigent defendants' rights.\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas concurred in the judgment but filed an opinion protesting what he considered to be past excesses of the Court in allowing third-party assertions of constitutional rights:\n\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, with whom Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter joined, dissented. They argued that only \"prudential considerations\" rather than constitutional ones prevented allowing the attorneys to assert the prisoners' rights. They said the attorneys had an economic interest in the issue because they \"would earn less for representation of indigent appellants than they earned in years prior to the cutback on state-funded appeals.\" They also asserted that the distinction between existing and prospecting clients was unwarranted since in many cases prospective sellers (such as the beer vendor in \"Craig\", the schools in \"Pierce\", etc.) were allowed to assert the rights of hypothetical customers. As for the hindrance issue, they took issue with the majority's assertion that indigent, uneducated defendants would not face serious obstacles to acting \"pro se\".\n\nMany organizations, such as trade unions, can also assert third party standing to represent their members. In \"Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm.\" (1977), the United States Supreme Court held that an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests it seeks to protect are germane to their organization's purpose and neither the claim asserted, nor the relief requested, requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\n\nThere are exceptions to the Third Party Standing rule, such as overbreadth and vagueness.\n\nIn patent and copyright cases, courts have at times allowed third-party standing to would-be sellers of goods or services to possessors of rights under patent or copyright law who were not situated in a way to assert the rights themselves.\n\nFor example, the owner of patented equipment (such as part of a car) has a right to repair it to keep it in good order. The US Supreme Court has held that a vendor of parts needed for this purpose may assert that right in defense against an infringement claim by the holder of patent rights on the equipment. Thus. US patent law permits a third party to assert the repair rights of the non-party owner of those rights.\n\nIn the UK, where such parts may be protected by a copyright on the drawings for the parts, the House of Lords has held that the doctrine against derogation from grants may be invoked by a seller of spare parts (such as a tailpipe for a car).\n\nSimilarly, in cases of unlawful patent tying the courts allow interloping would-be suppliers of the tied article to assert the rights of purchasers of the product subjected to the tie in order to aid them to escape from the tying.\n\nOn the other hand, in \"Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC v. New York Times Co.\", the Federal Circuit denied standing to assert the exhaustion doctrine to a seller of services (Internet news stories) to purchasers of patented equipment (smartphones) on two principal grounds:\n\nFirst, the defendant seller was not itself a purchaser from the plaintiff patentee. The court ruled that the exhaustion doctrine may be asserted only by an \"authorized acquirer\" — one who purchases the patented article from the patentee or its authorized seller. Thus, this court opined that third-party standing did not exist.\n\nSecond, the defendant did not show that the claims it was accused of infringing were licensed to and used by the purchasers of patented equipment. The patent claims in that case had been drafted so that one set of claims covered sending Internet stories to smartphones and a different set covered receiving stories. The defendant was accused of infringing the first set, but the smartphone purchasers and the licensed smartphone manufacturers who sold to them used the second set. The court said that the defendant had not shown that the licensed claims embodied substantially the same invention as the patent claims under which the defendant was sued, so that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply. This is a ruling that the exhaustion doctrine does not apply in these circumstances rather than a ruling on standing.\n"}

Pal. 87) is an illuminated manuscript compiled in Florence in the early 15th century. It is the single largest primary source of music of the 14th-century Italian \"Trecento\" (also known as the \"Italian ars nova\").\n\nIt consists of 216 parchment folios, organized by composer, with each composer's section beginning with a portrait of the composer richly illuminated in gold, red, blue and purple. The manuscript is in good condition, and musical pieces are complete. Included in the codex are 146 complete pieces by Francesco Landini, 37 by Bartolino da Padova, 36 by Niccolò da Perugia, 29 by Andrea da Firenze, 28 by Jacopo da Bologna, 17 by Lorenzo da Firenze, 16 by Gherardello da Firenze, 15 by Donato da Cascia, 12 pieces by Giovanni da Cascia, 6 by Vincenzo da Rimini, and smaller amounts of music by others. It contains 16 blank folios, intended for the music of Paolo da Firenze, since they are labeled as such and include his portrait; the usual presumption by scholars is that Paolo's music was not ready at the time the manuscript was compiled, since he was away from Florence until 1409. There is also a section marked out for Giovanni Mazzuoli which contains no music.\n\nThe manuscript was almost certainly compiled in Florence at the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, probably around 1410–1415. Because the same unidentified family seal appears on the first folio of the manuscript and on the portrait page of Paolo da Firenze, it was long suggested that Paolo may have had some part in supervising the effort or have been part of the family that commissioned the manuscript. However, more recent evidence about the biography and in particular poor finances of Paolo has his connection to financing the manuscript unlikely. The manuscript was owned by renowned organist Antonio Squarcialupi in the middle of the 15th century, then by his nephew, and then passed into the estate of Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici, who gave it to the Biblioteca Palatina in the early 16th century. At the end of the 18th century it passed into the ownership of the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana.\n\nThe first folio in the codex states: \"This book is owned by Antonio di Bartolomeo Squarcialupi, organist of Santa Maria del Fiore.\" On the following pages, added later, are humanistic poems in praise of Squarcialupi.\n\nAll of the compositions in the codex are secular songs in Italian: ballata, madrigals, and cacce: there are 353 in all, and they can be dated to the period from 1340 to 1415. Notably absent are Italian pieces by Johannes Ciconia, a northerner transplanted into Italy, and the more innovative compositions of Antonio Zachara da Teramo.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104643", "title": "Rope-a-dope", "text": "Rope-a-dope\n\nThe rope-a-dope is a boxing fighting technique commonly associated with Muhammad Ali in his 1974 Rumble in the Jungle match against world heavyweight champion George Foreman.\n\nIn many competitive situations, rope-a-dope is used to describe strategies in which one contender lets their opponent fatigue themself by drawing non-injuring offensive punches. This then gives the contender an advantage as the opponent becomes tired, allowing the contender to execute devastating offensive maneuvers and thereby win.\n\nThe rope-a-dope is performed by a boxer assuming a protected stance (in Ali's classic pose, pretending to be trapped and lying against the ropes, which allows much of the punch's energy to be absorbed by the ropes' elasticity rather than the boxer's body). The boxer keeps their guard up and is prepared for the incoming blows while looking for opportunities to counter punch their opponent, who by mounting an offensive may have left themself open to counters. By being in a defensive posture and being prepared for the incoming blows, the boxer decreases their chances of being caught with a clean flush blow, as ideally a significant portion of the punches will land on the boxer's hands and arms, or will miss completely as a result of the boxer slipping the punch. Additionally, if the opponent lacks stamina, their power will decrease throughout the fight as they lose energy, and essentially \"wastes\" many punches into the boxer's guard. \n\nHowever, a boxer employing this tactic must have a great chin and great ability to withstand punishment to be able to withstand the punches that do get through the boxer's defenses and land. Offensively, the boxer employing this tactic will look to exploit mistakes made in his or her opponent's attack by countering if the opponent has left himself or herself open. They will also look to mount short bursts of offensive attacks in between their opponent's attack, being sure to immediately get back in their defensive posture as to not leave themself open to a counter attack. Despite the name, the boxer does not have to be against the ropes in order to rope-a-dope the opponent.\n\nAccording to photographer George Kalinsky, Ali had an unusual way of conducting his sparring sessions, where he had his sparring partner hit him, which he felt \"was his way of being able to take punishment in the belly\". Kalinsky told him: \"Do what you do in a training session: Act like a dope on the ropes.\" Ali then replied: \"So, you want me to be a rope-a-dope?\"\n\nAccording to Angelo Dundee, Kalinsky told Ali: \"Why don't you try something like that? Sort of a dope on the ropes, letting Foreman swing away but, like in the picture, hit nothing but air.\" The publicist John Condon popularized the phrase \"rope-a-dope\".\n\nThe maneuver is most commonly associated with the match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, known as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\". Foreman was considered by many observers to be the favorite to win the fight due to his superior punching power. Ali purposely angered Foreman during the match, provoking Foreman to attack and force him back on the ropes. Some observers at the time thought that Ali was being horribly beaten and worried that they might see him get killed in the ring. Writer George Plimpton described Ali's stance as like \"a man leaning out his window trying to see something on his roof.\" Far from being brutalized, however, Ali was relatively protected from Foreman's blows. Norman Mailer described the advantage of Ali's rope-a-dope this way: \"Standing on one's feet it is painful to absorb a heavy body punch even when blocked with one's arm. The torso, the legs, and the spine take the shock. Leaning on the ropes, however, Ali can pass it along; the rope will receive the strain.\" Ali's preparation for the fight, which involved toughening himself up by allowing his sparring partners to pummel him, contributed to observers' sense that Ali was outmatched. But Ali took advantage and won the match when Foreman became tired from the punches he was delivering.\n\nManny Pacquiao used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist Miguel Cotto in their November 2009 fight. Pacquiao followed the rope-a-dope with a knockdown.\n\nNicolino Locche, an Argentine boxer nicknamed \"El Intocable\" (The Untouchable), used this technique extensively throughout his career. He would get against the ropes and dodge nearly every single punch until his opponent would tire, then he would take him down with combinations.\n\n\"Irish\" Micky Ward used this strategy during many of the fights in the later part of his career. Ward would wait for his opponent to become fatigued and would hit with either a left hook to the body or other combinations. This strategy led him to the junior welterweight championship of the WBU, where he took the belt from Shea Neary.\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. often used this technique in his bouts, as he demonstrated in his August 2017 fight against Conor McGregor.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "2104651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104651", "title": "Ahmed Deedat", "text": "Ahmed Deedat\n\nAhmed Hoosen Deedat (; ) (1 July 1918 – 8 August 2005) was a South African writer and public speaker of Indian descent. He was best known as a Muslim missionary, who held numerous inter-religious public debates with evangelical Christians, as well as video lectures on Islam, Christianity, and the Bible. Deedat established the IPCI, an international Islamic missionary organisation, and wrote several widely distributed booklets on Islam and Christianity. He was awarded the King Faisal International Prize in 1986 for his fifty years of missionary work. He wrote and lectured in English.\n\nDeedat was born in the town of Tadkeshwar, Surat, Bombay Presidency, British India in 1918. His father had emigrated to South Africa shortly after his birth. At the age of 9, Deedat left India to join his father in what is now known as Kwazulu-Natal. His mother died only a few months after his departure. Arriving in South Africa, Deedat applied himself with diligence to his studies, overcoming the language barrier and excelling in school, even getting promoted until he completed standard 6. However, due to financial circumstances, he had to quit school and start working by the time he was at the age of 16.\n\nIn 1936, while working as a furniture salesman, he met a group of missionaries at a Christian seminary on the Natal South Coast who, during their efforts to convert people of Muslim faith, often accused the Islamic Prophet Muhammad of having \"used the sword\" to bring people to Islam. Such accusations offended Deedat and created his interest in comparative religion.\n\nDeedat took a more active interest in religious debate after he came across the book \"Izhar ul-Haqq\" (\"Truth Revealed\"), written by Rahmatullah Kairanawi, while he was rummaging for reading material in his employer's basement. This book chronicled the efforts of Christian missionaries in India a century earlier. The book had a profound effect on Deedat, who bought a Bible and held debates and discussions with trainee missionaries, whose questions he had previously been unable to answer.\n\nHe started attending Islamic study classes held by a local Muslim convert named Mr. Fairfax. Seeing the popularity of the classes, Mr. Fairfax offered to teach an extra session on the Bible and how to preach to Christians about Islam. Shortly thereafter, Fairfax had to pull out and Deedat, by this point quite knowledgeable about the Bible, took over teaching the class, which he did for three years. Deedat never formally trained as a Muslim scholar.\n\nDeedat's first lecture, entitled \"Muhammad: Messenger of Peace\", was delivered in 1942 to an audience of fifteen people at a Durban cinema named Avalon Cinema.\n\nA major vehicle of Deedat's early missionary activity was the 'Guided Tours' of the Jumma Mosque in Durban. The vast ornamental Jumma Mosque was a landmark site in the tourist-friendly city of Durban. A program of luncheons, speeches and free hand-outs was created to give an increasingly large number of international tourists what was often their first look at Islam. Deedat himself was one of the guides, hosting tourists and giving introductions to Islam and its relationship with Christianity.\n\nIn 1949, Deedat moved to Pakistan with his family and lived in Karachi for three years. According to an interview on Pakistan Television, he had been a strong proponent of the idea of an Islamic state.\n\nAmong Deedat's close friends were Goolam Hoosein Vanker and Taahir Rasool, whom many refer to as 'the unsung heroes of Deedat's career'.\n\nIn 1957, these three men founded the Islamic Propagation Centre International (IPCI) with the aim of printing a variety of books on Islam and offering classes to new Muslims converts. The next year Deedat established an Islamic seminary called As-Salaam Educational Institute on a donated piece of land located in Braemar in the south of Natal province. The experiment was not a success, however, because of the IPC's lack of manpower and paucity of funds, and was taken over by the Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa in 1973. Deedat then returned to Durban and expanded the IPC's activities.\n\nBy the early 1980s Ahmed Deedat's work was beginning to be known outside his native South Africa. His international profile grew in 1986, when he received the King Faisal Award for his services to Islam in the field of Dawah (Islamic missionary activity).\nAs a result, at age of 66, Deedat began a decade of international speaking tours around the world. His tours included:\n\n\nOn the other hand, Deedat received heavy criticism from liberal Muslim groups in South Africa which felt he inaccurately represented Islam and was intolerant of people of other religions, including Christians, Hindus, Jews and Jains. Several monthly editions of the Muslim Digest of South Africa (July, August, September, October) in 1986 were almost entirely devoted to criticising Deedat's stance and \"his various dangerous activities\".\n\nProblems arose after the publication of \"From Hinduism to Islam\" (1987), a critique of Hindu beliefs and practices. Among others, Deedat criticised South African Hindus for praying to their various deities and being easily moved to convert to Christianity. Hindus and Christians had respected his oratory skills and arguments until then. But now, they rejected Deedat and united with other South African Muslim organisations in denouncing his attacks on other religions. Two years later, Jews joined the criticism after Deedat published \"Arab and Israel – Conflict or Conciliation?\"\n\nIn 1988, following the publication of Salman Rushdie’s fictional work \"The Satanic Verses\", Deedat supported the fatwā of the Ayatollah Khomeini calling for Rushdie's death. He said that Rushdie \"is a hypocrite and has blasphemed holy personalities. He should not be pardoned.\"\n\nIn his last tour to Australia, the publicity resulting from the presence of Deedat caused Franca Arena, member of the Legislative Council of the government of New South Wales to comment in her speech concerning racism:\n\nOn 3 May 1996, Ahmed Deedat suffered a stroke which left him paralysed from the neck down because of a cerebral vascular accident affecting the brain stem, leaving him unable to speak or swallow. He was flown to King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, where he was reported to be fully alert. He learned to communicate through a series of eye-movements via a chart whereby he would form words and sentences by acknowledging letters read to him.\n\nHe spent the last nine years of his life in a bed in his home in South Africa, looked after by his wife, Hawa Deedat, encouraging people to engage in Da'wah (proselytizing Islam). He received hundreds of letters of support from around the world, and local and international visitors continued to visit him and thank him for his work.\n\nOn 8 August 2005, Ahmed Deedat died at his home on Trevennen Road in Verulam in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. He is buried at the Verulam cemetery. Hawa Deedat died on Monday 28 August 2005 at the age of 85 at their home. His funeral prayer was led by Ismail ibn Musa Menk.\n\nWith funding from the Gulf states, Deedat published and mass-produced over one dozen palm-sized booklets focusing on the following major themes. Most of Deedat's numerous lectures, as well as most of his debates in fact, focus on and around these same themes. Often the same theme has several video lectures to its credit, having been delivered at different times and different places.\n\n\nCapitalizing on his popularity in the Middle East following his receipt of the King Faisal Award, Deedat secured a grant to print a collated volume of four of his popular booklets. 10,000 copies of this book titled \"The Choice: Islam and Christianity\" were initially printed in April 1993; this book was very popular in the 1990s, available for free at many missionary outlets across North America. Subsequently, several printing houses offered to print more, and within two years another 250,000 copies had been printed in several print runs across the Middle East.\n\nLater, a second paperback volume entitled \"The Choice: Volume Two\" containing six more of Deedat's booklets was published. Deedat also widely promoted a South African printing of \"\" by Abdullah Yusuf Ali with commentary and a detailed index. This was widely sold at subsidised cost to the general public, and is often mentioned in Deedat's speeches.\n\nDeedat also produced a booklet entitled \"Al-Qur'an: the Ultimate Miracle\" featuring the theory of 'the Number 19' that was popularised by Arizona-based Egyptian computer analyst Dr. Rashad Khalifa. However, this booklet was withdrawn after Dr. Khalifa disclosed some controversial beliefs, including his rejection of the entire Hadith literature of Islam.\n\nAccording to one scholar, Brian Larkin, \"Deedat's da’wa is of a particular kind. He has little to say about the errancy of Sufism or Shi’ism, for instance, and makes no particular demand for establishing an Islamic state (though he was supportive of these efforts in Nigeria). Rather his entire effort is directed at undermining and refuting Christian evangelism and arming Muslims against Christian attacks. His fame is thus based not on the mastery of Islamic sciences but on his thoroughgoing knowledge of the Bible. As one Nigerian characterized him, Deedat \"opened the eyes of millions of Muslims in the fine art of inter-religious dialogue.\" His knowledge of English, his skill at debating, and his mastery of other scriptures \"endeared him to the millions who have seen his videos or read his tracts, millions of which are sent free of charge all over the world. ... Deedat's source of authority, then, is an unusual one, drawing on the mastery of Christian rather than Muslim texts and his skill at English rather than Arabic.\"\n\nIt emerged that his dawah centre, IPCI, was financed by the Bin Laden family and that he had met Osama Bin Laden, whom he described positively.\n\nDeedat's debates and writings have been labelled a form of apologetics by Lloyd V. J. Ridgeon, professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Glasgow.\n\nMuslim scholar Farid Esack has criticised Deedat, comparing him to such fundamentalists as Rabbi Meir Kahane and Jerry Falwell, and writing: \nDeedat's multitude of anti-Christian, anti-Jewish and anti-Hindu videotapes have told us all that there is to be told about the other, and we are comfortable with that. There are times, of course, when questions surface about the importance of correct dogma, about the importance of labels to a God whom we believe sees beyond labels and looks at the hearts of people. Instead of pursuing these questions, we hasten back and seek refuge in \"the known.\" We order another of those Deedat tapes.\nThe Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism calls Deedat \"anti-Jewish\" but does not elaborate. In France sale and distribution of his books has been forbidden since 1994 as they are said to be violently anti-western, antisemitic and inciting to racial hate.\n\nHis supporters, among them his son maintain that he was \"a promoter of free speech and dialogue,\" while Abdulkader Tayob of University of Cape Town comments that he was only responding to Christian proselytization in a manner that was \"not good or bad – but worth reflecting on.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104654", "title": "Aston Martin V8", "text": "Aston Martin V8\n\nThe Aston Martin V8 is an automobile which was manufactured by Aston Martin in the United Kingdom from 1969 to 1989. As with all traditional Aston Martins, it was entirely handbuilt – with each car requiring 1,200 man-hours to finish.\n\nAston Martin were looking to replace the DB6 model and had designed a larger, more modern looking car. The engine was not ready, however, so in 1967 the company released the DBS with the straight-six \"Vantage\" engine from the DB6. Two years later, Tadek Marek's V8 was ready, and Aston released the DBS V8. With the demise of the straight-six Vantage in 1973, the DBS V8, now restyled and called simply the Aston Martin V8, became the company's mainstream car for nearly two decades. It was retired in favour of the Virage in 1989.\n\nFrom 1969 through 1972, Aston's flagship model was the DBS V8. Though the body and name was shared with the six-cylinder DBS, the V8 sold for much more. The body was a modern reinterpretation of the traditional Aston Martin look, with a squared-off grille and four headlights (William Towns admitted that the rear quarters were \"borrowed\" from the early Ford Mustang). Distinguishing features of the V8 model are the larger front air dam, 225/70VR15 tyres and lack of wire wheels, though some six-cylinder DBS cars also used the V8's alloy wheels. The tail lights were taken from the Hillman Hunter.\nA road test report of the time noted that the car had gained in weight with the fitting of the V8 in place of the previously used six-cylinder unit, despite the manufacturer's assurance that the engine weighed only more than the older straight-six. Other contributions to the weight gain included heavier ventilated brake discs, air conditioning, fatter tyres, a new and stronger ZF gearbox as well as some extra bodywork beneath the front bumper.\n\nMarek's V8 engine displaced 5.3 L (5,340 cc/325 in) and used Bosch fuel injection. Output was not officially released, but estimates center around 315 hp (235 kW). The DBS V8 could reach 100km/h (62mph) in 7.1 seconds and had a top speed of 242km/h (150 mph). 402 DBS V8s were built.\n\nA DBS V8 was planned to be used by Roger Moore's character in the television show, \"The Persuaders!\" but no V8 car was available at that time so a six-cylinder DBS was modified to look like a V8 model for use in the show.\n\nIn April 1972, the DBS V8 became just the Aston Martin V8 as the six-cylinder DBS was dropped, leaving just this car and the six-cylinder Vantage in production.\n\nThe V8 became known as the AM V8, a model retroactively referred to as the Series 2 V8 to separate it from later models. Visual differences included twin quartz-halogen headlights and a mesh grille, a front design which was to last until the end of production in 1989. AM V8 cars, produced from May 1972 through July 1973, used a similar engine to the DBS V8, albeit with Bosch fuel injection rather than the earlier carburetors. Just 288 Series 2 cars were built. Although David Brown had left the company, he had overseen development of this model. The first 34 cars still carried leftover \"DBS V8\" badging.\n\nThe car switched back to Weber carburetors for the Series 3 in 1973, ostensibly to help the car pass new stricter emissions standards in California but most likely because Aston Martin was unable to make the Bosch fuel injection system work correctly. These cars are distinguished by a taller hood scoop to accommodate four twin-choke (two-barrel) Weber carbs. The car produced and could reach in 6.1 seconds with an automatic transmission or 5.7 with a manual. Performance suffered with emissions regulations, falling to in 1976. The next year, a more powerful \"Stage 1\" engine with new camshafts and exhaust brought it up to .\n\nThese cars either fitted 225/70VR15 Avon TurboSpeed or 235/70VR15 Turbospeed Rolls Royce tyre on the Auto models or the 255/60R15 Pirelli Cinturato CN12 off the Vantage.\n\nProduction of Series 3 cars lasted from 1973 through October 1978, but was halted for all of 1975. 967 examples were produced in this time. While earlier V8 cars have louvers cut into the little panel mounted beneath the rear windshield, the Series 3 and later cars instead have a small lip at the bottom of this panel, just ahead of the leading edge of the bootlid.\n\nThe \"Oscar India\" specification was introduced in October 1978 at the Birmingham International Motor Show. Visually, the former scoop on the bonnet gave way to a closed \"power bulge\", while a spoiler was integrated into the tail. Most Oscar India cars were equipped with a Chrysler \"Torqueflite\" three-speed automatic transmission, with wood trim fitted for the first time since the DB2/4 of the 1950s. Just 352 Oscar India models were built from 1978 through 1985. The power of the now de-smogged engines kept dropping on American market cars, down to a low of in the early eighties.\n\nThe convertible \"Volante\" was introduced in June 1978, but featured the Series 4 bonnet from the get go - a few months before the coupé received the Oscar India update. The Volante Series 1 weighs more than the coupé, due to the necessity of reinforcing the frame. At this time, manufacturing a V8 Volante took about four months from beginning to end.\n\nUS market cars received much larger bumpers beginning with the 1980 model year, adding weight and somewhat marring the car's lines. Owners of US-specified cars often modify them to have the slimmer European bumpers. By 1981, the success of the Volante meant that the coupé model was only built on individual demand. The 1980s were also tuned to provide much better fuel economy, up by some thirty percent.\n\nThe fuel-injected Series 5 cars were introduced in January 1986 at the New York International Auto Show. The compact Weber/Marelli system no longer needed the space of the previous carburetors, so the bonnet bulge was virtually eliminated. 405 Series 5 cars were built before production ceased in 1989. The Volante Series 2 received the same changes; 216 were built.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1976, seven four-door Lagonda saloons were produced based on the Aston Martin V8, with a Lagonda-style outline grille fitted within the space normally filled by the standard Aston Martin grille.\n\n\nIn 1987 Timothy Dalton took over the role of James Bond from Roger Moore and EON Productions had decided to bring Aston Martin back to the Bond franchise with the new \"007\" now paired with a series 4 model in the film, \"The Living Daylights\". However, the film caused some confusion for viewers (even those quite familiar with Aston Martin models of that era). At the beginning of the film, the car is a V8 Volante (convertible). The actual car used in these scenes was a V8 Volante owned by Aston Martin Lagonda chairman, Victor Gauntlett. Later, the car is seen being fitted with a hardtop (\"winterised\") at Q Branch. However, later scenes actually feature a pair of V8 coupés with the same number plate as the Volante seen in the beginning of the movie, retrofitted with other \"optional extras\" such as spiked tyres, skis, lasers, and missiles. Clearly, the car was intended to be seen as a V8 Volante with hardtop.\n\nThe V8 coupé will make a comeback in the upcoming James Bond film, \"No Time to Die\". Aston Martin CEO Dr. Andy Palmer confirmed on June 20, 2019 that the V8 will make another appearance sporting the same registration it had in The Living Daylights 32 years prior.\n\n"}
{"id": "2104655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104655", "title": "Solanum aethiopicum", "text": "Solanum aethiopicum\n\nSolanum aethiopicum, the bitter tomato, Ethiopian eggplant, or nakati, is a fruiting plant of the genus \"Solanum\" mainly found in Asia and Tropical Africa. It is also known as Ethiopian nightshade, garden eggs, and mock tomato. It is a popular vegetable in north-east India, and is known as khamen akhaba in Manipuri and \"samtawk\" in Mizo. They are called \"Titay bii\" or simply \"bii\" in Darjeeling, Sikkim and Nepal and are relished with meat, particularly pork. These names are a result of its varied morphology, with ripe fruit often looking like a cross between an eggplant and a tomato, which are also from \"Solanum\". In fact, the Ethiopian eggplant was so much confused with the ordinary eggplant that this was considered by some a variety \"violaceum\" of \"S. aethiopicum\".\n\nEthiopian eggplant may have originated from the domestication of \"Solanum anguivi\". The scarlet eggplant, also known as Gilo or \"jiló\", was long held to be a distinct species (\"S. gilo\") but is nowadays generally considered to be a cultivar group of \"S. aethiopicum\".\n\nEthiopian eggplant has been used as a source of disease resistance genes for several commercially grown Solanaceae crops, including \"Solanum melongena\" (eggplant). A lack of genomic resources has meant that breeding has lagged behind other vegetables, although a 1.02-Gb draft genome has been sequenced by BGI, with single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified for use by breeders.\n\nThe leaves of \"Solanum aethiopicum\" are eaten as a leaf vegetable and are actually more nutritious than the fruit.\n\nThe highly variable fruit of the plant is eaten both raw and cooked and is becoming more popular as a cultivated crop. These fruits are usually harvested while still green, before the skin becomes thick. The bitterness depends on the levels of saponin it contains, some with a sweet flavor and others very bitter. When the berries mature, they turn bright red because of high carotene content.\n\n\"Solanum aethiopicum\" is used as an ornamental in Asia.\n\nIn Nigeria, Igbo people use it as a substitute for kolanut especially for those who do not want to chew kolanut. In which case it is used to welcome guests at home or before resumption of a traditional ceremony.\n\nGarden egg as it is commonly known in Nigeria is sometimes used to make a tomato based sauce which can be used to eat yam\n\nCurrently there is a large movement towards increased cultivation of \"Solanum aethiopicum\" in West Africa. It grows all year long and can produce high fruit yields. However, low germination rates are an obstacle to wider cultivation.\nThe only place where \"S. aethiopicum\" is grown to a significant extent in Europe lies in South Italy, to be precise in Rotonda in the Basilicata, where this plant is of some commercial importance. Probably it was introduced by veterans returning from East Africa after the colonial war in the late 19th century.\n\nAlways make sure to check for homonyms before placing redirects\n\nthese refer to the Ethiopian eggplant in the strict sense:\nLycopersicon aethiopicum (L.)

{"id": "2104684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104684", "title": "Philippine epic poetry", "text": "Philippine epic poetry\n\nPhilippine epic poetry is the body of epic poetry in Philippine literature. Filipino epic poetry is considered to be the highest point of development for Philippine folk literature, encompassing narratives that recount the adventures of tribal heroes. These epics are transmitted through oral tradition using a select group of singers and chanters.\n\nA study revealed that the Philippine folk epics, like those found elsewhere in Asia, are often about a quest for a wife as well as the various ordeals linked to the founding of a family, hamlet, tribe or a kingdom. The narratives would include voyages - on earth, sea, sky, and the underworld - to allow the hero or heroine to overcome the challenges faced. After the ordeal, the protagonists - through an increase or improvement of his or her qualities - would become the ideal man or woman.\n\nE. Arsenio Manuel defines heroic narratives in verse as \"folk epics\" or \"ethnographics\" and describes common characteristics to them:\n\nWithin folk epic poems, common themes can be observed.\nEpics are generally sung during folks festal and recreational gatherings such as weddings, baptisms, wakes, prestige rites, peace agreements, and the like. They are sung primarily as entertainment, to enjoy hearing of accounts of ancestors performing heroic deeds. The singing also serves as an inspiration to the youth to emulate their heroes, and for would-be singers to become singers themselves. Among some groups, such as the Ifugao people, certain types of \"Hudhud\" songs are prescribed for certain occasions, such as during the death of a prominent person, or when ancestral bones are dug out to be blessed, or during harvest, like the \"Hudhud hi Aliguyon\". The Palawan \"Kudaman\" is also sung on special occasions - as an offering to the lord of the chase when they can catch a wild boar, or to welcome a guest in their \"rurungan\".\n\nThe epic singer can be male or female, often learning the epics from older relatives or well-known singers in the community. The singing of epics usually takes place in the evening and is dictated by the singer's preference; there is quieter in the evening and it allows for deeper concentration on the singer, who sometimes sings for two to four hours as a time. Virgilio Resma reports that Perena, a female singer, sang \"The Tale of Sandayo\" from 9 PM to 3 AM for seven nights in 1980. Among the Ifugaos, the \"hudhud\" may sung during daytime as a harvest song.\n\nPhilippine folk epics describe the adventures of the hero and can be classified into two groups: \"epics of romance\", in which the main adventures consist of the hero's courting of specific women or his search for beautiful ladies he can marry, and epics in which the hero undertakes adventures mainly in the service of his family, his country, his people, and for others. Epics that prove the hero's valor and worth as a man also belong to the second group. These two groups are not mutually exclusive, and predominantly romantic epics also contain adventures of the other kind and vice-versa.\n\nPrimary examples of epics in the first group are \"Lam-Ang\", the \"Ulalim\", \"Labaw Donggon\", \"Bantugan\", \"Lumalindaw\", and \"Kudaman\". Some of these epics, however, are not exclusively of the first group. For example, Lam-Ang's first adventure was his quest for his father who had gone to fight the Igorots and never came back.\n\nIn the second group of epics, examples include the Agyu cycle of epics, The Maiden of the Buhong Sky, \"Tulalang\", the \"Hudhud hi Aliguyon\", the three Subanon epics, \"Ibalon\", \"Tuwaang Attends a Wedding\", \"Maharadia Lawana\", and \"Tudbulul\".\n\nThe Philippine epic hero, like counterparts in other countries, are strong and brave, of great fighting prowess, and possess a restless, adventurous spirit, great determination, and endurance. Philippine epic heroes are also endowed with supernatural or magic powers and possess magic objects and/or animals and even guardians or friendly spirits, sometimes voices, that advise them in moments of need. \n\nThe life of a Philippine epic hero usually follows a pattern, similar to the Hero's journey:\n\nThe Philippine epic hero is usually depicted as having an impressive physical appearance and is usually described as such. The Subanon hero, Sandayo, is described as:\n<poem>\nA handsome datu\nRadiant and resplendent\nAs if he stood not\nOn earthly ground\nStraight as a tree\nLike a son of Diwata\nLike some rare flower\nBeautiful to behold\n</poem>\n\nPhilippine epic heroes are also described as having loud voices which make men tremble. Lumalindaw was said to have a voice so strong that when he shouts at a crow, it falls in front of him; when he shouts at a coconut tree, the coconuts fall. They also stand out as acknowledged leaders in their respective communities, such as Tuwaang, or Bantugan, who while not the king of his realm, is described as having no rival among the lords of the kingdom. \n\nOne of the most distinctive characteristics of Philippine epic heroes is their possession of supernatural powers, or magic animals and/or objects. The Ifugao hero, Aliguyon, is a notable exception to this rule, being the only one with no extraordinary power beyond his natural prowess. \n\nThe range of the hero's supernatural prowess ranges from the mild to the extraordinary. Except for their endurance, the heroes in the Ifugao \"hudhud\" are down-to-earth and benign in comparison to other heroes. In contrast, heroes in Central and South Philippine epics cannot continue without \"mana\", or some supernatural being aiding them, or without the magical properties of the tools that they use.\nPhilippine folk epics have some shared conventions that differ from other classical epics. Philippine folk epics may or may not have formal openings. \"Lam-Ang\", for example, opens with \"Listen then while I narrate at length the life of Lam-Ang\", while \"Aliguyon\" opens without much formality: \"Aliguyon, son of Amtalao, who resided in Hannanga one early morning said, 'Where are you, comrades of Aliguyon, do what is done in Hannanga'\"\n\nEpics belonging to the Agyu cycle vary in that they have formal openings, called the \"ke`ppu`unpu`un\", which is the introductory part of the entire cycle of epics. Attached to this is the \"sengedurug\", which represents an account of a portion of Agyu's life in Nelendangan, the earth name of his paradise. The Taiwan cycle also has an introductory part called the \"tabbayanon\", consisting of two parts: the first is subjective and speaks of the singer's love, dreams, and frustrations. The prelude closes with a \"tail\", which serves to connect it to the main body of the story.\n\nPhilippine epics narrate the adventures of the hero in chronological order, many of them beginning with the hero's birth. None begin \"in medias res\" like in the Iliad. The epics narrate the hero's life and adventures and end in happy endings. If the hero dies, he is brought back to life. In at least two epics, the hero brings his people to heaven. Only \"Lumalindaw\" diverts from this with a somber ending, where, after giving parting advice to his children, enters the cave where the Voice that has guided his life resides, and is seen no more.\n\nA common convention is the use of repetition of various kinds: repetition of a scene, repetition of lines, rituals, and formulaic passages. In \"Labaw Donggon\", the hero goes courting three times and the same lines he speaks to his mother are repeated. Some motifs are also repeated under the significance attached to the number. Subanon epics, for example, hold the numbers 7 and 8 in special significance. In \"Ag Tobig nog Keboklagan\", Taake, when seven months old, cries for seven days and seven nights; sleeps for seven days and seven nights; goes fishing for seven days and seven nights; catching seven bins of fish; sleeps again for seven days and nights and awakes a young man; travels for seven months before reaching Keboklagan; courts the Lady of Pintawan for seven days before she accepts; the rumor of this marriage spreads for seven days before it reaches the Datus of Keboklagan, who plans to kill him within seven days; Taake and his companions rest in Dibaloy for seven nights; they journey back to Sirangan for seven days, and he holds a \"buklog\" for seven days.\n\nIn both \"Taake\" and \"Sandayo\", special attention is given to the hero's hair. Their hair is oiled, combed, and arranged to eight folds. Sandayo has his hair oiled and combed eight times, and wound eight times. When he sleeps, eight tiers of mosquito nets are placed over him. When he drinks wine, he empties eight wine jars. His robe has eight folds.\n\nPhilippine folk epics sometimes extend to the realm of heavenly regions and the underworld. In \"Labaw Donggon\", the hero courts his wives across three worlds. Similarly, the Gaddang hero Lumalindaw seeks his fourth wife, Caligayan, in the Underworld, in a place called Nadaguingan, guarded by dwarfs. In \"Tuwaang Attends a Wedding\", Tuwaang descends to the Underworld during his fight with the Young Man of Sakadna. In the \"Tale of Sandayo\", Bolak Sonday searches for Sandayo in the Underworld when he dies. When Bolak Sonday dies, Mendepesa is sent to look for her soul. \n\nWhen Islamic missionaries came to Mindanao and converted the Moros, Mindanaoan epics changed to conform to the new faith. In the epic of Maranao, \"Darangen\", for instance, they have made Muslim prophet Muhammad as the forefather of the hero, Bantugen. Today, there are twenty-one epics that survived from Visayas and Mindanao, but others did not. Some of the epics, especially in Luzon, perceived to center on pagan beliefs and rituals, were burned and destroyed by Spanish friars during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines islands in the 16th century. There are only two folk epics that survived from Luzon.\n\nTruly, there were substantial writings by early natives that Jesuit historian Fr. Pedro Chirino noted: \"\"All of the islanders are much given to reading and writing. And there is hardly a man, much less a woman who did not read and write.\"\" (Relacion de las isles Filipinas-1604).\n\nEstablished epic poems of notable quality and length blossomed. Early historians like Padre Colin, Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga and Antonio Pigafetta have all attested to the existence of these epics. There were even reports of a dramatic play given by natives at the arrival of Don Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565.\n\nEpic poems and songs about the exploits of enchanted folk heroes were performed during festivities and proper occasions. Most often, these epic poems (folk epics or ethno-epics) were titled after the names of the hero involved, except for some which carry traditional titles like the Kalinga Ullalim; the Sulod Hinilawod; the Maranao Darangen; or the Bicol Ibalon.\n\nStories about folk heroes of long ago were described as \"\"Old Time History\"\" because; they can be used to study the lifestyle and beliefs of the people who produced them. They were also referred to as \"\"Lost\"\" because they were soon forgotten by natives influenced heavily by Spanish and \"western\" colonization.\n\nThe famed orientalist, \"Chauncey Starkweather\", stressed that: \"\"These epic romances are charming poems in the Malayan literature.\"\"\n\nSome scholars however dispute the claim that in the early days of Spanish intrusion, priests in their zealous rage against paganism destroyed all existing records, as well as all forms of writing and artworks, regarding ancient Philippine folk heroes.\nThese scholars, mostly schooled in Catholic schools and Catholics themselves, hold that the colorful and fascinating literature of pre-Hispanic Filipinos is still here, giving the new generation an overview of a heritage that is unique and deemed as an invaluable source of joy and information with regards to the lifestyle, love, and aspirations of early Filipinos.\n\nIndeed, it is through these wonderful surviving epics every Filipino may mirror his or her national identity.\n\nIt is through these folk epics that every Filipino can feel heroic, truly pulsating with the splendor of a magnificent and authentic cultural force. An epic history of the Filipinos comes with epic characters like \"biag ni lamang\".\n\nCarl Rehang \n-Author\n\nTwo epic poems are coming from among Christian Filipinos in Luzon. They are \"Biag ni Lam-ang\" or \"The Life of Lam-ang\" and the \"Ibalon\", from the Bicol region. The epics coming from the non-Christian Filipinos in Luzon meanwhile are The Hudhud and the Alim of the Ifugaos, The Ulalim of the Kalingas, and The Epic of Lumalindaw of the Giddings. The epics from the Visayas are The Hinilawod of the Sulod people of Central Panay Island and The Kudaman of Palawan, while the epics from Mindanao are The Maiden of the Bushong Sky, the Tuwaang Attends A Wedding, Agyu, The Tulelangan of the Ilianon Manoboc, The Darangen of the Maranaos, Guman of Dumalinao, Ag Tubig Nog Keboklagan (The Kingdom of Keboklagan), Keg Sumba Neg Sandayo (The Tale of Sandayo) and The Tudbulul of the T'boli of South Cotabato.\n\nFrom the Bicol Region comes the Ibalong. The Ibalong relates the mystical origins of the first man and the first woman of Aston and Ibalong, which are current provinces of Camarines, Albay, Sorsogon, Catanduanes, and Masbate. Handing, one of the heroes of Ibalong (The others are Baltog and Bantong ) was a great leader of warriors. He won over the seductive serpent Oriol before starting a village. His Village prospered and soon, other friends of Handiong went to help him in leading the village. The system of writing was introduced by Surat. Dinahong Pandak taught them how to make jars, utensils in cooking, plow, harrow, and other farming implements. Weaving cloth was known with the help of Hanlon. Lastly, Ginantong taught them to make boats, blades, knives, and things used in a house. Events in this epic also had a flood story similar to that of the Biblical Genesis. This epic has the story of how the Mayon Volcano was made.\n\nThe Deranged tells of the sentimental and romantic adventures of noble warriors, one of them, is about a warrior-prince called Bantugan. Prince Bantugen was the brother of the chieftain of a village called Bumbaran. Bantugen owned a magic shield, was protected by divine spirits called \"Tonongs\" and was capable of rising from the dead. Once his enemies attacked Bumbaran, thinking he was dead. In the nick of time, Bantugan's soul was recovered and he saved the village. There is also an episode, where Prince Bantugen was on a quest and fought his enemies with his magic Kampilan(Native sword). Soon, he got tired and fell onto the water. A crocodile delivered him to his enemies, but he regained his strength, escaped his captors, and commands an oarless ship and won the battle.\n\nThere were also \"Darangen epic poetries that relate stories of wars about abducted princesses. Just like the chronicles of the Trojan War.\n\nThe Deranged is one of the oldest and longest Philippine epic poetries. Several nights were needed to recite the twenty-five beautiful chapters. The Deranged, sung in its original, possessed a sustained beauty and dignity, it might be studied for its esthetic values alone.\n\nThere were Philippine epic poems written and published much later. The Ibong Adarna, whose author is unknown, was written in Tagalog and published in the 18th century, while Florante at Laura, also in Tagalog, authored by Francisco Balagtas, was published in the 19th century. In 1961, Ricaredo Demetillo published Barter in Panay, claimed to be the first literary epic of the Philippines. It was written in English. Other contemporary epics were authored by Dr. Cirilo Bautista, whose epic was written in three decades and placed at 9,872 lines in length, The Trilogy of Saint Lazarus, comprises The Archipelago (1970), The Telex Moon (1975) and Sunlight On Broken Stones (1999) and Edwin Cordevilla's Ten Thousand Lines Project For World Peace (2013), which as the title suggests, is 10,000 lines long. Both epics were written in English. \n\nThere are multiple epic texts that can be found in the Philippines, owing to its diverse cultural background. To date, over twenty have been collected, transcribed, and published by academic scholars.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Philippine mythology]]\n[[Category:Philippine poetry]]\n[[Category:Epic poems]]"}
{"id": "2104700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104700", "title": "Aston Martin Virage", "text": "Aston Martin Virage\n\nThe Aston Martin Virage is an automobile produced by British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin as a replacement for its V8 models. Introduced at the Birmingham Motor Show in 1988, it was joined by the high-performance Vantage in 1993, and then the name of the base model was changed to V8 Coupé in 1996.\n\nThe V8-powered model was intended as the company's flagship model, with the 6-cylinder DB7, introduced in 1994, positioned below it as an entry-level model. Although the DB7 became available with a V12 engine and claimed a performance advantage, the Virage remained the exclusive, expensive and hand-built flagship of the Aston Martin range. It was replaced in 2000 with the Vanquish. By the end of the 2000 model year, 1,050 cars in total had been produced. The V8 Vantage name reappeared on a new entry-level model in 2005.\n\nA new Virage model was introduced at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, to fit into the middle of Aston Martin's then current lineup but was discontinued in 2012 due to many similarities between the brand's other models.\n\nWhen compared to the preceding V8, the design was fresh and more modern. The Virage was more similar in design language to the Lagonda than the V8 it replaced. Indeed, the chassis was an evolution of the Lagonda's, with a de Dion tube rear suspension, located by triangulated radius rods and a Watts linkage, and a double wishbone unit at the front. To cut costs, many of the less-important pieces came from other companies, as had been the case for Aston Martin automobiles of the past. The sleek headlights and taillights were sourced from the Audi 200 and the Volkswagen Scirocco respectively, while General Motors, Jaguar, and Ford provided the steering column, climate control panel, wing mirrors and dash switches. In fact, Ford had purchased Aston Martin and Jaguar shortly before the Virage debuted and it became the first model to be introduced under the new ownership.\n\nThe Virage was a large, heavy car in spite of its all-aluminium body, but the 32-valve 5.3 L (5,340 cc) V8 engine's torque elevated its performance to near sports car levels. \"Acceleration just never seems to run out\", claimed \"Sports Car International\" during a first test. They also praised the \"eager and quicker revving\" nature of the engine with its Callaway-designed heads and Weber-Marelli fuel injection. \"Nothing sounds quite like an Aston V8,\" they concluded. The 1790 kg (3946 lb) car could attain a top-speed of . The automatic variant could accelerate to from a standing start in about 6.5 seconds (7.4 seconds for the manual version). An engine power upgrade to upgrade to was announced at the 1996 Geneva Motor Show. English actor Rowan Atkinson owned a Virage Coupé which featured on the front cover of Car May 1990. In the article he commented how the modern climate control system provided heating efficiency beyond the veteran Aston driver's dreams and could not believe warm air would emanate from the footwell within 90 seconds of start up.\n\nThe five-speed ZF Friedrichshafen manual was fitted to about forty percent of the cars produced. The more popular automatic option was the Chrysler three-speed Torqueflite transmission. For the 1993 model year, the three-speed unit was replaced by a four-speed automatic unit. The six-speed manual from the Vantage also became optional at the end of the Virage's production run.\n\nIn January 1992, Aston Martin introduced a conversion service, upgrading the car into a Virage 6.3. As the name implies, the centerpiece of the conversion was a bored and stroked V8 derived from the AMR1 racing car. This engine has a power output of at 6000 rpm and 480 lb·ft (651 N·m) of torque at 5800 rpm, allowing the car to attain a top speed of .\n\nOther changes included 362 mm (14 in) ventilated disc brakes, the largest used in a passenger car until the Bentley Continental GT, and 18 in (457 mm) wheels. Visually, the 6.3 had wide flared bumpers, low sills and air dams, and side air vents.\nA shooting brake (estate) version of the Virage was offered in limited numbers. It debuted at the March 1992 Geneva Motor Show. Unlike prior Aston Martin Shooting Brake models, however, the Virage was produced in-house by the company's Works Service, with six believed to be constructed in total. The cars were priced at . The cars are believed to have retained Virage chassis numbers, except two that received chassis numbers of the type \"DP/2099\".\nThe \"Lagonda Saloon\" is a long-wheelbase four-door Virage model that was built in very limited numbers to customer orders, reviving Aston Martin's long-dormant second marque. Introduced in 1994, it was manufactured by Aston Martin Works Service with a chassis extension, although two were ordered with an extension. The name refers to the four-door Aston Martin Lagonda. The Lagonda Virage cost about and only eight or nine are believed to have been produced, with some being conversions of regular Virages.\n\nThe five-door Lagonda Virage Shooting Brake debuted at the same time as the Lagonda Virage. It was made by Aston Martin Works Service in only one or two examples, and has been spotted bearing \"\"Vacances\"\" badging at the rear.\n\n\nA less extreme V8 Coupé replaced the standard Virage from 1996 onwards having the updated styling inherited from the more powerful Vantage. Lacking the superchargers and the more aggressive body style of its sibling, the engine in the V8 Coupé has a power output of and 369 lb·ft (500 N·m) of torque. In total, 101 examples of the V8 Coupé were built from 1996 through 2000.\n\nThe convertible version of the Virage, called the Virage Volante debuted at the 1990 Birmingham Motor Show as a strict two-seater, but a 2+2 version was shown at the 1991 Geneva Motor Show. Production examples, first appearing in 1992, were all to feature 2+2 seating. Sources state that either 224 or 233 examples had been produced when production ended in 1996. The last 11 examples already had the naturally aspirated 1995 version of the engine found in the later V8 and V8 LWB Volante models with the improved four-speed and overdrive Torqueflite automatic and a power output of , which may be part of why there is some disagreement to the production numbers.\n\n1992 was also when Aston Martin introduced its 6.3-litre \"Works Service\" package, which included wider fenders to accommodate the larger OZ wheels and 14-inch disc brakes, additional vents, deeper sills, and other appearance modifications. This was immediately available on the Coupé as well as the Volante. Aston Martin soon introduced a strictly cosmetic version called the Wide Body featuring the regular 5.3-liter engine; this was mainly intended for the United States market as the 6.3 was not certified for sale there. 13 of these were built for the United States, whereas only seven regular Virage Volantes were delivered there. In contrast to the \"all show, no go\" Wide Body Volante, the Prince of Wales chose to equip his 1994 Volante with the standard bodywork coupled with the 6.3-litre engine and a manual transmission.\n\nA new V8 Volante Long Wheelbase, with updated styling of the V8 Coupé was produced from 1997 to 2000 on a lengthened chassis. Only 63 units were built by the time production came to a halt.\n\nAs with many other Aston Martin models, a high-performance Vantage model of the Virage would later be introduced. First shown at Birmingham in September 1992, the Vantage was produced from 1993 through 2000 and, like many other Aston Vantage models would soon became the only variant available. The Virage name lasted just a few years, with its final descendants inheriting the simple and familiar V8 name.\n\nThe Vantage had new styling with only the roof, doors and wing mirrors shared with the Virage. The wing mirrors were later replaced in favour of newly styled wing mirrors exclusive to this model. The Vantage is wider, lower, used four round tail lights (later adopted for the base V8 Coupé), and featured new rear suspension and interior electronics. Like the 6.3, the Vantage used record-sized 362 mm (14 in) brake discs and 18 inch wheels.\n\nThe biggest change to the Vantage was inside the engine compartment. The V8 engine now used twin superchargers. Power output was now (and homologated at ), and the torque was equally high at 555 lb·ft (745 N·m) at 4,000 rpm. Top speed was , with acceleration to 97 km/h (60 mph) taking 4.6 seconds. Customers cars could be returned to Works Service starting in 1998 to be converted to V600 specifications, where the engine was upgraded to at 6200 rpm and of torque at 4400 rpm. The production version is often referred to as \"V550\" to set it apart from the later, more powerful, Works Service modified V600 conversions.\n\nIn 2000, Aston Martin's Works Service unit also built nine bespoke Vantage Volante models (convertibles), one of which was built to long wheelbase specifications.\n\nThe new European emission and safety regulations made Aston Martin decide to end production of the V8-Vantage line and the final model was called \"V8 Vantage Le Mans\". Honoring Aston Martin's 1959 victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the prototype of a limited run of 40 was presented in Geneva in 1999 on the 40th anniversary of the win.\n\nAll LeMans Vantags were sent back after delivery to have the engine modifications to deliver and of torque, and were supported by a suspension reinforced with special Koni shock-absorbers and stiffer anti-roll bars. The bodywork featured a blanked-out front grille and modified side vents – replicating the side vents of the Le Mans winning DBR-1 – as well as a bigger front spoiler and rear skirt. The interior was reworked with a gigantic rev-counter, a special Titanium finish on some parts, and features such as heated windshield, parking radars, traction control, heated electric seats, and full Connolly leather upholstery with matching Wilton wool carpets. Wheels were the same Dymag magnesium units as seen on most V600s. Performance included a claimed top speed of and 0 to 100 km/h acceleration being achieved in 3.9 seconds. The keyholder was in sterling silver and a map from Newport-Pagnell to the legendary Le Mans track was provided in the delivery documents. Each car was made upon special commission and fitted with a number plate indicating also the name of the first owner.\nThe Virage would not become available in the United States until the summer of 1990 and the Virage Volante convertible became available later in 1992. Shooting Brake versions and the Virage Vantage were not officially offered for sale in the U.S. The car's availability ended after the 1993 model year, due to the lack of passenger airbags and inability to meet emissions regulations.\n\nA new generation of the Virage was introduced at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show by Aston Martin. The Virage capitalised on the technology from the DBS and united it with the comfort and refinement found in the DB9 and Rapide. The Virage was intended to sit in the narrow slot between the basic DB9 and the flagship DBS. Aston Martin announced that the second generation of the Virage would be discontinued after 18 months of production, as the distinctions between it, the DB9, and the DBS were simply too slim.\n\nThe car has a 2-seat or 2+2 seating configuration. The Virage's 5.9-litre V12 engine has a power output of and of torque. It is capable of accelerating from 0 to in 4.6 seconds, and has a top speed of . The Virage was available in two bodystyles: Coupé or Volante (convertible).\n"}

The show's host is comedian and broadcaster Peter Berner. It was first broadcast in 2004 and in 2009 the show commenced its sixth and final season, with the ABC announcing the program would not be renewed in 2010. The final episode aired on 22 November 2009. It was broadcast on Sunday nights at 6:30 pm from 2004 until 2009 & now on Tuesdays at 1:30pm on ABC. \"The Einstein Factor\" was created by Australian television producer, Barry O'Brien, and was produced by Sparkz with Ian Duncan and Shaun Levin as Executive Producers.\n\nThe show's self-styled goal is to find the person who \"knows everything about something and something about everything\". To that end, contestants with specially nominated subjects appear each week. The show was also noted for Berner's offbeat manner and humorous approach to being a quizmaster. The program proved quite popular with a wide audience, unusually so for a program broadcast on the ABC.\n\nThe key to the program's uniqueness is the use of a Brains Trust, a panel of three \"experts\", usually celebrities, who compete alongside the contestants. Regular Brains Trustees have included Barry Jones, Berner's radio colleagues Tony Moclair and Matt Parkinson, comedians Tim Ferguson and Michael Veitch, musician Red Symons and scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki. Actor, historian and musician Alice Garner was also an occasional member of the Brains Trust.\n\n\nA season of \"The Einstein Factor\" can be divided into three parts of 13 episodes each plus the series grand final, bringing the total number of episodes in a season to 40. The winners of each programme's heats compete at the end of the series in a series of \"Play-Offs\", the winners of which compete in a \"Series Final\".

{"id": "2104711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104711", "title": "Howard Frankland Bridge", "text": "Howard Frankland Bridge\n\nThe W. Howard Frankland Bridge is the central bridge spanning Old Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. It is one of three bridges connecting Hillsborough County and Pinellas County; the others being Gandy Bridge and Courtney Campbell Causeway. The bridge carries Interstate 275 and is by far the most traveled of the bay's bridges.\n\nThe bridge is often incorrectly referred to as the Howard \"Franklin\" Bridge.\n\nNamed for the man who proposed it, Tampa businessman Howard Frankland, the bridge opened in April 1960 and carried four lanes (two lanes in each direction separated by a short, narrow barrier). The bridge and approaches cost $16 million.\n\nBecause of the bridge's design, including its lack of emergency shoulders, it proved to be dangerous. Accidents were common on the bridge and traffic backed up on both sides, leading to local nicknames, the \"Howard Frankenstein Bridge\" and \"The Car-Strangled Spanner\". In 1962, a steel-reinforced tapered concrete barrier was installed \"to prevent cars from hurtling the median and crashing into oncoming traffic.\" Ten people had already died. The bridge was the subject of a \"60 Minutes\" broadcast in the 1960s noting the below-average construction methods used.\n\nPlanning for a larger-capacity replacement began in 1978. Original plans ranged from a large, multi-lane suspension (or similar type) bridge, to two parallel bridges (with the central span reserved for HOV lanes). As traffic projections increased, further exacerbated by a disaster on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in 1980, it was clear that the new bridge would need to handle at least eight lanes (four in each direction). By 1987, it was concluded that a parallel, four lane span would be built. Plans were also made to rehabilitate the older bridge after the new bridge opened.\n\nConstruction began on the new span in 1988. The new $54 million southbound span was opened to traffic in 1990. The older bridge was then closed, rehabilitated, and reopened in 1992. The older northbound span is shorter and has a steeper hump than the newer southbound span.\n\nBefore the parallel bridge was built, I-275 utilized a bypass designation system. Whenever there would be a major delay at the Howard Frankland Bridge, special signs would alert drivers to the delay and direct them to utilize the bypass, which ran along SR 694 and across the Gandy Bridge, to the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway, Willow Avenue, Howard Avenue, and ending at Interstate 275. Special shields (marked N and S) along the route made sure that drivers were using the correct thoroughfare.\n\nAfter the widening project in 1992, Interstate 275 was increased to eight lanes on the bridge itself. However, this did not increase capacity on either end of the bridge. Backups were still seen on the Howard Frankland heading into Tampa, primarily due to a bottleneck at the SR 60/Veterans Expressway exit. On the St. Petersburg side, after a comprehensive reconstruction project that took over ten years, lane counts were increased from four lanes prior to the bridge to six lanes through downtown St. Petersburg, and eight lanes from Gandy Boulevard to the bridge.\n\nA reconstruction project was planned to begin in 2007 for I-275 between the Howard Frankland and downtown Tampa. However, due to rising cost of materials, FDOT planned to reconstruct the interstate in smaller phases rather than the original larger two-phase project and was delayed to 2019. Once the reconstruction project is finished in 2020 or 2021, major traffic congestion on the Howard Frankland is expected to be significantly reduced.\n\n\n"}

It was commissioned by the Georgia General Assembly on January 27, 1854 and conducted its final run on March 25, 1961.\n\nOn January 27, 1854, The General Assembly of the State of Georgia enacted legislation for the construction of a railway linking the towns of Athens and Clayton. This railway, known as the North Eastern Railroad (Georgia), was chartered in 1856; however the outbreak of the American Civil War delayed construction. The line was chartered on October 17, 1870, and opened between Athens and Lula on September 1, 1871, a distance of 39 miles. In 1881 the railroad was sold to the Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&D), a predecessor of the Southern Railway, which connected with the Northeastern at Lula. The R&D began the Clayton extension from Cornelia, 12 miles from Lula. In 1882 it reached Tallulah Falls, 21 miles from Cornelia. The line was projected to pass through Rabun Gap and on to Knoxville, Tennessee, but no work was done. Tallulah Falls was a popular tourist destination and at one time seventeen hotels and boarding houses catered to the trade. On October 24, 1887, the Blue Ridge and Atlantic Railroad (BR&A) was chartered by the State of Georgia, and in early 1888, bought the branch from the R&D. In 1893, however, it defaulted and a receiver was named. On March 21, 1897, a decree was entered ordering the sale of the road, and on November 7, 1897, the BR&A was sold at foreclosure. In March 1898, the Tallulah Falls Railway Company was organized to buy the BR&A and extend it to Franklin. By October 1903, eight miles had been added and the North Carolina State line was reached early in 1904. When Franklin was reached in June 1907 the line was 57.2 miles long. However, the effort exhausted the road's resources and a receiver was appointed in January 1908. The line was reorganized and came into the control of the Southern Railway System, which let it operate independently. In 1948, the railroad finally switched from steam power to diesel.\n\nThe Tallulah Falls Railway again entered into receivership in 1923, under which it would operate until its closure in 1961. The railway's primary source of income had been passenger services, but tourism gradually waned, and the railway began to operate at ever greater monetary losses. In 1933, J.F. Gray, a receiver, petitioned for the railway's abandonment. However, while permission for abandonment was granted, no action was taken due to public sentiment for the railroad; it continued to operate with little to no profit until 1955.\n\nThe Tallulah Falls Railway appears in the opening scene of the 1951 drama \"I'd Climb the Highest Mountain\" with temporarily reinstated 2-8-0 #75 being used in the film. Later, in 1955, Walt Disney selected the railway as the location of principal photography for \"The Great Locomotive Chase\". The rural location of the track closely resembled the setting of the actual chase, which occurred nearly 100 years earlier in the town of Kennesaw, Georgia (then called Big Shanty) along the line of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. By then, the W&A was a part of the Louisville and Nashville (L&N) and was too modern to play the part of a Civil War railroad. The decrepit condition of the TF, however, was perfect. According to railway employees, Disney was quite fond of the railway and expressed interest in purchasing it for use as an excursion line. However the Southern Railway management refused, citing an accumulated debt of $300,000 on the part of the railway. On March 10, 1961, The Tallulah Falls Railway was ordered to be sold as scrap.\n\nThe Tallulah Falls Railway had 42 massive wooden trestles which had to be negotiated along the 58 mile journey from Cornelia to Franklin. The shortest trestle was about 25 feet in length and the longest was 940 feet in length. Only one trestle was made of steel and concrete. Two trestle collapses with fatalities occurred during the operation of the railway: an 1898 collapse at Panther Creek and a 1927 collapse at Hazel Creek.\n\n\n"}

His father was a wealthy landowner of Spanish ancestry owner of large \"haciendas\" and \"fincas\" in the Southern Peru.\n\nHe was educated at the San Jerónimo Seminary, Arequipa, and Stonyhurst College, Lancashire. Romaña received his B.A. from King's College London in 1868 and was appointed a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers of London in 1872. He went to India and worked in the construction of the Ravi Bridge for the Punjab Northern State Railway and then to Brazil where he was employed by the Public Works Construction Company in the construction of the railroad line from the Madeira River to the Mamoré River. The climate of the Brazilian Amazon was so unhealthful that of thirty engineers engaged in the work twenty-one died before it was completed. \n\nUpon his return to Peru in 1874, he devoted himself to the management of one of the family plantations in the Tambo Valley and worked in the fledgling agricultural development and engineering circles of the country. When the war with Chile broke out in 1879, he was appointed commanding general of the civic division of Tambo which operated in the coast of Arequipa. Having under his command three battalions, he took an active part in the expedition which stopped the Chilean Army from entering Arequipa city and compelled it to reembark at Mollendo. When the Chilean counter-attacked in 1882, they initially defeated them once again but then the city surrendered to the southern army after the provisional government was deposed. \n\nResiding in Arequipa after the war, he was elected President of the Liberal Club and served three terms as Director of the Public Charity of the city. After Nicolás de Piérola and the National Coalition between \"Civilistas\" and Democrats triumphed in the Civil War of 1894, Romaña was elected Deputy for Arequipa in the 1895 general election and was designated First Vice-President of his chamber by the Congress. When President Piérola created the Ministry of Public Works in January 1896, he was appointed for this portfolio but his ministry lasted less than seven months because the Barinaga Cabinet fell in August of the same year. The following year he was elected Mayor of Arequipa but was compelled to resign due to a conflict of interest with the city's infrastructure projects.\n\nIn 1898 he was elected Senator for Ayacucho. By July 1899, when Piérola's administration called general election, the National Coalition offered the presidential candidacy to his brother Alejandro (former Prime Minister) but he declined in favor of Eduardo, an independent.\n\nDuring these years, Carlos de Piérola, a democrat and brother of former president Nicolás de Piérola, was the majority leader of the Chamber of Deputies, while Manuel Candamo, a civilista party leader, presided over the Senate. This division allowed for the prevalence of the democrats in the Chamber of Deputies, and for the \"civilistas\" in the Senate. These differences, however, rapidly led to the democrats leading the opposition. López de Romaña reshuffled his cabinet almost exclusively with \"civilistas\", a move which resulted in the majority democrats of the Chamber of Deputies to continuously censure. \n\nAs a result, there were various parliamentary discords concerning the non-dismissal of censured ministers. The development in agriculture also continued during López de Romaña's term, as well as that in the mining and other related industries. The code of mining was promulgated in 1901, as well as the Code of Trade and the Code of Waters in 1902. He also created the \"Nueva Compañia\" (\"New Company\") for the collection of the taxes of the state. In 1901, the creation of Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina took place under his sponsorship and that of a Belgian mission. López de Romaña faced various coups in favor of the former president Andrés Avelino Cáceres, but he successfully completed his presidency in 1903. It was under his term that Peruvians coined the term \"Aristocratic Republic\" which continued until the second government of Augusto B. Leguía and the hegemony of the Civil Party in the government of the country. \n\nEduardo Lopez de Romaña died at the Yura mineral springs near Arequipa on May 26 1912.\n\nLópez de Romaña married María Josefa de Castresana y García de la Arena on 20 March 1877. The couple had three children. His wife died after the war with Chile and he remarried his former sister-in-law Julia de Castresana. They had six children.\n\n"}

In 2003, he signed to Capitol Nashville and released his eponymous debut album. Both it and its follow-up, 2005's \"Modern Day Drifter\", are certified platinum in the United States. A third album, 2006's \"Long Trip Alone\", is certified gold. It was followed in mid-2008 by a greatest hits package. His fourth album, \"Feel That Fire\" was released in February 2009. A bluegrass album, \"Up on the Ridge\", was released on June 8, 2010; a sixth album, \"Home\", followed in February 2012, as did a seventh one, \"Riser\", in 2014. Bentley's eighth album, entitled \"Black\", was released in May 2016. His ninth and most recent studio album, \"The Mountain\", was released on June 8, 2018.\n\nBentley's studio albums have accounted for 25 singles on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, of which 17 have reached number one: his debut single \"What Was I Thinkin'\", \"Come a Little Closer\", \"Settle for a Slowdown\", \"Every Mile a Memory\", \"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)\", \"Feel That Fire\", \"Sideways\", \"Am I the Only One\", \"Home\", \"5-1-5-0\", \"I Hold On\", \"Drunk on a Plane\", \"Say You Do\", \"Somewhere on a Beach\", \"Different for Girls\", \"Woman, Amen\" and \"Living\". Seven more of his singles have reached the top 5.\n\nBentley was born on November 20, 1975, in Phoenix, as the son of Leon Fife Bentley (August 16, 1923 – June 1, 2012), a bank vice-president, and Catherine Childs. His father was born in Glasgow, Missouri, to Richard Thomas and Mary Cecile Fife Bentley, and was a First Lieutenant in World War II. His middle name, Dierks (which he now uses as his first name publicly), is also his maternal great-grandmother's surname. He attended Culver Academies in Indiana and graduated from The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey in 1993. Afterward, he spent a year at the University of Vermont (UVM) before transferring to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he graduated in 1997.\n\nBentley worked at The Nashville Network (now Paramount Network), researching old footage of country performances. In 2003, Capitol Nashville released Bentley's self-titled debut album. The album's first single, \"What Was I Thinkin',\" reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts later that year. The next two singles from that album, \"My Last Name\" and \"How Am I Doin',\" reached number 17 and number 4, respectively. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\nBentley's second album, \"Modern Day Drifter\", was released in 2005. It spawned two number one singles with \"Come a Little Closer” and \"Settle for a Slowdown\" and the number three hit \"Lot of Leavin' Left to Do.\" The album was also certified platinum.\n\nIn 2005, Bentley won the CMA Award for the Horizon Award (now Best New Artist) and was invited to be a member of the Grand Ole Opry. The induction took place on October 1, 2005. Bentley stands as the third youngest member after Carrie Underwood and Josh Turner.\n\nOn June 10, 2006, Bentley released his third album, \"Long Trip Alone\". The album produced two number one hits with \"Every Mile a Memory\" in 2006 and \"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)\" in 2007. The title track reached No. 10 on the country charts, while the fourth single, \"Trying to Stop Your Leaving,\" peaked at number 5.\n\nIn 2007, Bentley released a live DVD titled \"Live and Loud at the Fillmore\", which was filmed in Denver, Colorado.\n\nIn a March 2008 interview, Bentley said he would let his fans be the executive producers of his first greatest hits album, \"Greatest Hits/Every Mile a Memory 2003–2008\". The album was released on May 6, 2008. An album cut, \"Sweet & Wild,\" reached No. 51 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The song was an uncredited duet with fellow country singer Sarah Buxton.\n\nBentley's fourth studio album, \"Feel That Fire\", was released in February 2009. Its title track, co-written by Brett Beavers and The Warren Brothers, became Bentley’s sixth number one hit in February 2009. The album’s second single, \"Sideways,\" became his seventh number one hit in summer 2009. The third and final single, \"I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes,\" peaked at number 2.\n\nBentley released his fifth studio album, \"Up on the Ridge\", on June 8, 2010. The title track was released to iTunes on April 20, 2010. The song peaked at number 21 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Bentley's first single to miss the Top 10 since \"My Last Name.\" The second single from the album, \"Draw Me a Map,\" reached number 33.\n\nBentley's sixth album, \"Home\", was released on February 7, 2012, led by the single, \"Am I the Only One\" which reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Country Singles. The second single off the album is \"Home\", which was co-written by Bentley, Brett Beavers, and Dan Wilson (musician) also reached No. 1 on March 24, 2012. A third single, \"5-1-5-0\", was released shortly after \"Home\" fell from number one on the country chart. Dierks has been quoted by American Songwriter explaining “I wrote too many songs. I wrote 70. I wrote a lot. There’s 64 that are never going to see the light of day. That’s 64 days that I can’t get back.”\n\nOn August 21, 2012, Bentley released the \"Country & Cold Cans\" EP on iTunes. It includes five songs, including a radio edit of the track \"Tip It On Back\" from his album \"Home\". Bentley paid for the studio time to record the EP himself. On October 23, Bentley and Miranda Lambert announced the co-headlined 33-show Locked and Reloaded Tour, that began on January 17, 2013.\n\nBentley's seventh album, \"Riser\", was released on February 25, 2014. The album's first single, \"Bourbon in Kentucky\", was released to country radio on June 10, 2013. It peaked at number 45 on the \"Billboard\" Country Airplay chart, becoming Bentley's lowest charting single to date. The album's second single, \"I Hold On\", was released on August 26, 2013. It became his first number one on the Country Airplay chart in April 2014 and also his eleventh overall to do so. The third single, \"Drunk on a Plane\", followed that same month. It reached number one on Country Airplay in August 2014 and was also a strong commercial hit, reaching number 27 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The album's fourth single, \"Say You Do\", was released on October 6, 2014. It reached at number one on Country Airplay in May 2015. The title track became the album's fifth single in June 2015.\n\nBentley along with Eric Paslay are featured on Charles Kelley's debut solo single, \"The Driver\" which was released on September 28, 2015. The song received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nBentley released his eighth album, \"Black\", on May 27, 2016. The album's first single, \"Somewhere on a Beach\", was released on January 25, 2016.\n\nBentley co-hosted the 51st Academy of Country Music Awards on April 3, 2016, where he was also nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year and Video of the Year.\n\nBentley released a series of four short films for songs from \"Black\", with episode one being the song \"I'll Be the Moon\" featuring Maren Morris. The following episode serves as the video for \"What the Hell Did I Say\". The album's second single, \"Different for Girls\" featuring Elle King, was released to country radio on June 6, 2016. It reached at number one on Country Airplay in October 2016. The album's title track was released to country radio as the third single on November 14, 2016.\n\nHe was also selected as one of 30 artists to perform on \"\"Forever Country\"\", a mash-up track of Take Me Home, Country Roads, On the Road Again and I Will Always Love You which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.\n\n\"The Mountain\" is the ninth studio album recorded by Bentley. It was released on June 8, 2018, via Capitol Records Nashville. The first single from the album was \"Women, Amen\", which peaked at #1. The second single from the album was \"Burning Man\" which also peaked at #1 (Mediabase only). The third and final single, \"Living\" also went #1.\n\nBentley's side project, a 90s country cover band named Hot Country Knights, signed on with Bentley's label Universal Music Group Nashville as a separate recording act in 2020. The act consists of his road band, all of whom operate under stage names. It released its debut single \"Pick Her Up\" on January 23, 2020. Bentley wrote the song with Jim Beavers and Brett Beavers, and features guest vocals from Travis Tritt.\n\nBentley married Cassidy Black on December 17, 2005, in Mexico. They live in Nashville, with their three children, dogs Jake (who has appeared in a few of Dierks' album covers and videos (died July 10, 2016)) and George. The couple has two daughters, Evalyn \"Evie\" Day Bentley, born on October 4, 2008; Jordan Catherine Bentley, born on December 25, 2010; and son, Knox Bentley, born on October 9, 2013. Evie makes a vocal appearance on the song, \"Thinking of You\", from Bentley's 2012 album \"Home\".\n\nBentley holds a private pilot license and owns a Cirrus SR22T and Cessna Citation Mustang.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104803", "title": "Ibogaine", "text": "Ibogaine\n\nIbogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive substance found in plants in the family Apocynaceae such as \"Tabernanthe iboga\", \"Voacanga africana\", and \"Tabernaemontana undulata\". It is a psychedelic with dissociative properties.\nPreliminary research indicates that it may help with drug addiction; however, there is a lack of clinical research. Its use has been associated with serious side effects and death. Between the years 1990 and 2008, a total of 19 fatalities temporally associated with the ingestion of ibogaine were reported, from which six subjects died of acute heart failure or cardiopulmonary arrest. The total number of subjects who have used it without major side effects during this period remains unknown. It is used as an alternative medicine treatment for drug addiction in some countries. Its prohibition in other countries has slowed scientific research. Ibogaine is also used to facilitate psychological introspection and spiritual exploration. Derivatives of ibogaine that lack the substance's psychedelic properties (such as 18-MC) are under clinical trials for, have been shown to be neither psychedelic nor psychoactive, and have a positive safety\nprofile in humans.\n\nThe psychoactivity of the root barks of the iboga tree (\"Tabernanthe iboga\"), from which ibogaine is extracted, was first discovered by the Pygmy tribes of Central Africa, who passed the knowledge to the Bwiti tribe of Gabon. French explorers in turn learned of it from the Bwiti tribe and brought iboga back to Europe in 1899-1900, where it was subsequently marketed in France as Lambarene. Ibogaine-containing preparations are used for medicinal and ritual purposes within African spiritual traditions of the Bwiti, who claim to have learned it from the Pygmy peoples. Although it was first commonly advertised as having anti-addictive properties in 1962 by Howard Lotsof, its Western use predates that by at least a century. In France, it was marketed as \"Lambarène\" and used as a stimulant. Also, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) studied the effects of ibogaine in the 1950s.\n\nIbogaine is an indole alkaloid that is obtained either by extraction from the iboga plant or by semi-synthesis from the precursor compound voacangine, another plant alkaloid. The total synthesis of ibogaine was described in 1956. Structural elucidation by X-ray crystallography was completed in 1960.\n\nIbogaine is derived from the root of the \"Tabernanthe iboga\", a plant known to exhibit psychedelic effects in its users. The experience of ibogaine occurs in two phases, termed the visionary phase and the introspection phase. The visionary phase has been described as oneirogenic, referring to the dreamlike nature of its psychedelic effects, and lasts for 4 to 6 hours. The second phase, the introspection phase, is responsible for the psychotherapeutic effects. It can allow people to conquer their fears and negative emotions. Ibogaine catalyzes an altered state of consciousness reminiscent of dreaming while fully conscious and aware so that memories, life experiences, and issues of trauma can be processed.\n\nIbogaine is not currently approved for any medical uses. Clinical studies of ibogaine to treat drug addiction began in the early 1990s, but concerns about cardiotoxicity led to termination of those studies. There is currently insufficient data to determine whether it is useful in treating addiction. Nonetheless, some alternative medicine clinics administer ibogaine for this purpose, in what has been called a \"vast, uncontrolled experiment.\" , there is a phase-2 clinical trial of Ibogaine for the treatment of alcoholism scheduled for August 2020 in Brazil.\n\nIn Bwiti religious ceremonies, the root bark is pulverized and swallowed in large amounts to produce intense psychoactive effects.\n\nOne of the first noticeable effects of large-dose ibogaine ingestion is ataxia, a difficulty in coordinating muscle motion which makes standing and walking difficult without assistance. Xerostomia (dry mouth), nausea, and vomiting may follow. These symptoms may be long in duration, ranging from 4 to 24 hours in some cases. Ibogaine is sometimes administered \"per rectum\" to avoid nausea and vomiting.\n\nIbogaine causes long QT syndrome at therapeutic doses, apparently by blocking hERG potassium channels in the heart.\n\nWork in the laboratory of Mark Molliver at Johns Hopkins indicated degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells observed in rats given substantially larger dosages of ibogaine than those used to study drug self-administration and withdrawal. However, subsequent research found no evidence of neurotoxicity in the primate or mouse at dosages that produced cerebellar degeneration in the rat, and it has been suggested that cerebellar degeneration might be a phenomenon limited to a single species. The FDA was aware of Molliver's work at the time it approved a Phase 1 study in which humans received ibogaine in 1993. Neuropathological examination revealed no evidence of degenerative changes in a woman who had received four separate doses of ibogaine ranging between 10 and 30 mg⁄ kg over a 15-month interval prior to her death due to a mesenteric artery thrombosis with small bowel infarction 25 days after her last ingestion of ibogaine. A published series of fatalities temporally associated with the ingestion of ibogaine found no evidence suggesting a characteristic syndrome of neurotoxicity.\n\nAdverse interactions may occur between ibogaine and psychiatric medications. Some studies also suggest the possibility of adverse interaction with heart conditions.\n\nBecause ibogaine is one of the many drugs that are partly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 complex, caution must be exercised to avoid foods or drugs that are similarly metabolized by CP450, in particular foods containing bergamottin or bergamot oil, such as grapefruit juice.\n\nIbogaine affects many different neurotransmitter systems simultaneously.\n\nNoribogaine is most potent as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It acts as a moderate κ-opioid receptor agonist and weak µ-opioid receptor agonist or weak partial agonist. It is possible that the action of ibogaine at the kappa opioid receptor may indeed contribute significantly to the psychoactive effects attributed to ibogaine ingestion; Salvia divinorum, another plant recognized for its strong hallucinogenic properties, contains the chemical salvinorin A, which is a highly selective kappa opioid agonist. Noribogaine is more potent than ibogaine in rat drug discrimination assays when tested for the subjective effects of ibogaine.\n\nIbogaine is metabolized in the human body by cytochrome P450 2D6 into noribogaine (more correctly, O-desmethylibogaine or 12-hydroxyibogamine). Both ibogaine and noribogaine have a plasma half-life of around two hours in the rat, although the half-life of noribogaine is slightly longer than that of the parent compound. It is proposed that ibogaine is deposited in fat and metabolized into noribogaine as it is released. After ibogaine ingestion in humans, noribogaine shows higher plasma levels than ibogaine and is detected for a longer period of time than ibogaine.\n\nIbogaine is a tryptamine. It has two separate chiral centers, meaning that there are four different stereoisomers of ibogaine. These four isomers are difficult to resolve.\n\nOne recent total synthesis of ibogaine and related drugs starts with 2-iodo-4-methoxyaniline which is reacted with triethyl((4-(triethylsilyl)but-3-yn-1-yl)oxy)silane using palladium acetate in DMF to form 2-(triethylsilyl)-3-(2-((triethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)-1H-indole. This is converted using N-iodosuccinamide and then fluoride to form 2-(2-iodo-1H-indol-3-yl)ethanol. This is treated with iodine, triphenyl phosphine, and imidazole to form 2-iodo-3-(2-iodoethyl)-1H-indole. Then, using 7-ethyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene and cesium carbonate in acetonitrile, the ibogaine precursor 7-ethyl-2-(2-(2-iodo-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene is obtained. Using palladium acetate in DMF, the ibogaine is obtained. If the exo ethyl group on the 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane system in ibogaine is replaced with an endo ethyl, then epiibogaine is formed.\n\nCrystalline ibogaine hydrochloride is typically produced by semi-synthesis from voacangine in commercial laboratories.\n\nA synthetic derivative of ibogaine, 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), is a selective α3β4 antagonist that was developed collaboratively by the neurologist Stanley D. Glick (Albany) and the chemist Martin E. Kuehne (Vermont). This discovery was stimulated by earlier studies on other naturally occurring analogues of ibogaine such as coronaridine and voacangine that showed these compounds also have anti-addictive properties.\n\nIbogaine occurs naturally in iboga root bark. Ibogaine is also available in a total alkaloid extract of the \"Tabernanthe iboga\" plant, which also contains all the other iboga alkaloids and thus has only about half the potency by weight as standardized ibogaine hydrochloride.\n\nThe use of iboga in African spiritual ceremonies was first reported by French and Belgian explorers in the 19th century. The first botanical description of the \"Tabernanthe iboga\" plant was made in 1889. Ibogaine was first isolated from \"T. iboga\" in 1901 by Dybowski and Landrin and independently by Haller and Heckel in the same year using \"T. iboga\" samples from Gabon. Complete synthesis of ibogaine was accomplished by G. Büchi in 1966. Since then, several other synthesis methods have been developed.\n\nFrom the 1930s to 1960s, ibogaine was sold in France in the form of Lambarène, an extract of the \"Tabernanthe manii\" plant, and promoted as a mental and physical stimulant. The drug enjoyed some popularity among post-World War II athletes. Lambarène was withdrawn from the market in 1966 when the sale of ibogaine-containing products became illegal in France.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the World Health Assembly classified ibogaine as a “substance likely to cause dependency or endanger human health”; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assigned it Schedule I classification, and the International Olympic Committee banned it as a potential doping agent.\n\nAnecdotal reports concerning ibogaine's effects appeared in the early 1960s. Its anti-addictive properties were discovered accidentally by Howard Lotsof in 1962, at the age of 19, when he and five friends—all heroin addicts—noted subjective reduction of their craving and withdrawal symptoms while taking it. Further anecdotal observation convinced Lotsof of its potential usefulness in treating substance addictions. He contracted with a Belgian company to produce ibogaine in tablet form for clinical trials in the Netherlands, and was awarded a United States patent for the product in 1985. The first objective, placebo-controlled evidence of ibogaine's ability to attenuate opioid withdrawal in rats was published by Dzoljic \"et al.\" in 1988. Diminution of morphine self-administration was reported in preclinical studies by Glick \"et al.\" in 1991. Cappendijk \"et al.\" demonstrated reduction in cocaine self-administration in rats in 1993, and Rezvani reported reduced alcohol dependence in three strains of \"alcohol-preferring\" rats in 1995.\n\nAs the use of ibogaine spread, its administration varied widely; some groups administered it systematically using well-developed methods and medical personnel, while others employed haphazard and possibly dangerous methodology. Lotsof and his colleagues, committed to the traditional administration of ibogaine, developed treatment regimens themselves. In 1992, Eric Taub brought ibogaine to an offshore location close to the United States, where he began providing treatments and popularizing its use. In Costa Rica, Lex Kogan, another leading proponent, joined Taub in systematizing its administration. The two men established medically monitored treatment clinics in several countries.\n\nIn 1981, an unnamed European manufacturer produced 44 kg of iboga extract. The entire stock was purchased by Carl Waltenburg, who distributed it under the name \"Indra extract\" and used it in 1982 to treat heroin addicts in the community of Christiania. Indra extract was available for sale over the Internet until 2006, when the Indra web presence disappeared. Various products are currently sold in a number of countries as \"Indra extract\", but it is unclear if any of them are derived from Waltenburg's original stock. Ibogaine and related indole compounds are susceptible to oxidation over time.\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) began funding clinical studies of ibogaine in the United States in the early 1990s, but terminated the project in 1995. Data demonstrating ibogaine's efficacy in attenuating opioid withdrawal in drug-dependent human subjects was published by Alper \"et al.\" in 1999. A cohort of 33 patients were treated with 6 to 29 mg/kg of ibogaine; 25 displayed resolution of the signs of opioid withdrawal from 24 hours to 72 hours post-treatment, but one 24-year-old female, who received the highest dosage, died. Mash \"et al.\" (2000), using lower oral doses (10–12 mg/kg) in 27 patients, demonstrated significantly lower objective opiate withdrawal scores in heroin addicts 36 hours after treatment, with self-reports of decreased cocaine and opiate craving and alleviated depression symptoms. Many of these effects appeared sustainable over a one-month post-discharge follow-up.\n\nThe Global Ibogaine Therapy Alliance publishes a map of ibogaine legal status in various countries around the world.\n\nIbogaine treatment clinics have emerged in Mexico, Canada, the Netherlands, South Africa, and New Zealand, all operating in what has been described as a \"legal gray area\". Costa Rica also has treatment centers, most notably one run by Lex Kogan, a leading proponent of ibogaine. Covert, illegal neighborhood clinics are known to exist in the United States, despite active DEA surveillance. While clinical guidelines for ibogaine-assisted detoxification were released by the Global Ibogaine Therapy Alliance in 2015, addiction specialists warn that the treatment of drug dependence with ibogaine in non-medical settings, without expert supervision and unaccompanied by appropriate psychosocial care, can be dangerous — and, in approximately one case in 300, potentially fatal.\n\n\"Detox or Die\" (2004)\n\"Ibogaine: Rite of Passage\" (2004)\n\"Facing the Habit\" (2007)\n\"Tripping in Amsterdam\" (2008)\n\"I'm Dangerous with Love\" (2009)\n\"Hallucinogens\" (2012)\n\"Addiction\" (2013)\n\"The Ibogaine Safari\" (2014)\n\"Dosed\" (2019)\n\nWhile in Wisconsin covering the primary campaign for the United States presidential election of 1972, gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson submitted a satirical article to \"Rolling Stone\" accusing Democratic Party candidate Edmund Muskie of being addicted to ibogaine. Many readers, and even other journalists, did not realize that the \"Rolling Stone\" piece was facetious. The ibogaine assertion, which was completely unfounded, did a significant amount of damage to Muskie's reputation, and was cited as a factor in his loss of the nomination to George McGovern. Thompson later said he was surprised that anyone believed it. The article is included in Thompson's post-election anthology, \"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72\" (1973).\n\nAuthor and Yippie Dana Beal co-wrote the 1997 book \"The Ibogaine Story\".\n\nAmerican author Daniel Pinchbeck wrote about his own experience of ibogaine in his book \"Breaking Open the Head\" (2002), and in a 2003 article for \"The Guardian\" titled \"Ten years of therapy in one night\".\n\nIbogaine factors into the stories of these episodes from television drama series:\n\n\nThe most-studied therapeutic effect of ibogaine is the reduction or elimination of addiction to opioids. An integral effect is the alleviation of symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Research also suggests that ibogaine may be useful in treating dependence on other substances such as alcohol, methamphetamine, and nicotine, and may affect compulsive behavioral patterns not involving substance abuse or chemical dependence. Researchers note that there remains a \"need for systematic investigation in a conventional clinical research setting.\"\n\nMany users of ibogaine report experiencing visual phenomena during a waking dream state, such as instructive replays of life events that led to their addiction, while others report therapeutic shamanic visions that help them conquer the fears and negative emotions that might drive their addiction. It is proposed that intensive counseling, therapy, and aftercare during the interruption period following treatment is of significant value. Some individuals require a second or third treatment session with ibogaine over the course of 12 to 18 months. A minority of individuals relapse completely into opiate addiction within days or weeks. A comprehensive article (Lotsof 1995) on the subject of ibogaine therapy detailing the procedure, effects, and aftereffects is found in \"Ibogaine in the Treatment of Chemical Dependence Disorders: Clinical Perspectives\". Ibogaine has also been reported in multiple small-study cohorts to reduce cravings for methamphetamine.\n\nThere is also evidence that this type of treatment works with LSD, which has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on alcoholism. Both ibogaine and LSD appear to be effective for encouraging introspection and giving the user occasion to reflect on the sources of their addiction, while also producing an intense, transformative experience that can put established patterns of behavior into perspective; ibogaine has the added benefit of preventing withdrawal effects.\n\nIn 1957, Jurg Schneider, a pharmacologist at CIBA (now a division of Novartis), found that ibogaine potentiated morphine analgesia. No additional data was ever published by CIBA researchers on ibogaine–opioid interactions. Almost 50 years later, Patrick Kroupa and Hattie Wells released the first treatment protocol for concomitant administration of ibogaine with opioids in human subjects, indicating that ibogaine reduced tolerance to opioid drugs. Their paper in the \"Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies\" journal demonstrated that administration of low \"maintenance\" doses of ibogaine HCl with opioids decreases tolerance, but noted that ibogaine's potentiating action could make this a risky procedure.\n\nIbogaine has been used as an adjunct to psychotherapy by Claudio Naranjo, documented in his book \"The Healing Journey\". He was awarded patent in 1974.\n\n"}
{"id": "2104807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104807", "title": "The Robbery", "text": "The Robbery\n\n\"The Robbery\" is the third episode of the first season of the NBC sitcom \"Seinfeld\".\n\nIt aired as the third episode of the season on June 7, 1990. It was written by Matt Goldman, therefore making this the first \"Seinfeld\" episode not written by the show's creators: Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David.\n\nIn the episode, Jerry leaves Elaine in charge of his apartment while he goes on tour. When he returns, he finds the apartment has been robbed after Kramer left the front door open. While Kramer promises to find the robbers, George offers him the chance to move into a much better apartment—a move he accepts, allowing Elaine to move into Jerry's apartment and away from her annoying roommate Tina.\n\nJerry goes away to perform some stand-up in Minneapolis, leaving Elaine to look after his apartment. Elaine is having trouble with an annoying roommate, Tina, who is a \"Waitress/Actress\" hoping to get a part, and asks George if he can find her some new accommodation. She then tries to persuade Jerry to give her his current apartment, with George offering Jerry a new apartment on West 83rd Street by Central Park which he claims is great. Jerry turns the offer down. When Jerry returns he finds the apartment has been burglarized because Kramer left the front door open by mistake. As a way of making up, Kramer promises to find the items that were stolen from Jerry.\n\nAfter the robbery, Jerry agrees to have a look at the new apartment. The apartment is great and Jerry takes it, allowing Elaine to move into the old apartment. Jerry is about to sign the lease to the apartment, but George tells him that if he was having second thoughts, he should not take it. Realizing that George wants the new apartment for himself, Jerry gambles with him for the apartment and wins. Meanwhile, Kramer thinks he knows where Jerry's stolen objects are, and suspects an Englishman along the hallway who denies having any \"stuff\" on him.\n\nLater in Monk's Café, Jerry goes back on the deal and decides not to take the place because George wants it. The two continue to argue about who should own it, and decide that neither of them should take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, but Jerry, George, and Elaine regret that Jerry didn't take the new apartment. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.\n\n\"The Robbery\" was written by Matt Goldman, a firstimer, therefore making this episode the first not to be written by Seinfeld or David and the only one not written by Seinfeld and David for the season, and directed by Tom Cherones, during the course of the first production season. The idea for the episode was inspired by Seinfeld's own experiences of his apartment being robbed when he was a student, although rather than the door being unlocked as it was in the episode, the burglars broke through the walls. Co-creator of the series Larry David was given a $20,000 bonus by Castle Rock and was promoted to executive producer for his work on the episode. During the shooting of the episode, an earthquake struck the set, but no one was hurt.\n\nThe episode is the first to mention the character of Tina, Elaine's actress roommate, although she does not appear in this episode. It is also the first episode to feature Kramer making a sliding entrance into Jerry's apartment, which became a trademark in all the later episodes. Carolyn the waitress, played by Anita Wise, and her husband Larry, are named after Seinfeld's own sister and brother-in-law.\n\nIn the original draft of the script, the Englishman is called \"Berbick.\" In the same script, Elaine asks Jerry what happened between Kramer and the Englishman. Jerry replies, \"Kramer stayed there three hours. They're like best friends now.\"\n\nWhen \"The Robbery\" first aired on June 7, 1990, it received a Nielsen rating of 13.6/24. This means that the episode was watched by 13.6% of American households, and that 24% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it.\n\nReviews of the episode were mixed. Andy Patrizio from IGN.com wrote that \"The Robbery\" was the best episode of the first season of \"Seinfeld\", saying that it showed \"the dynamics that would come to define the show.\" However, Colin Jacobson for \"DVD Movie Guide\" said, \"It lacks the great banter and play that marks the best episodes, but it doesn't come across as a total dud. It just seems a bit uninspired in the greater scheme of things.\"\n\n"}

Its members became de facto independent rulers following the breakup of the Ilkhanate until their defeat in 1357.\n\nThe Injuids gained control of parts of Persia, mostly Fars, in 1304 at the beginning of the reign of the Ilkhan Öljeitü. The Ilkhan had given Sharaf al-Din Mahmud Shah control of the \"injü\" (or \"inji\"; the Mongol word for the royal estates). Sharaf al-Din was reportedly descended from 'Abd-Allah Ansari, an 11th-century mystic of Herat. His son, Amir Ghiyas al-Din Kai-Khusrau, assisted another family, the Muzaffarids, in their takeover of Yazd. By 1325 Sharaf al-Din had gained nearly an absolute grip on the region. His power displeased Öljeitü's successor Abu Sa'id, who ordered Sharaf al-Din removed and sent a Sheikh Hussein ibn Juban to replace him. Kai-Khusrau, who ruled Shiraz for his father, resisted; and Sheikh Hussein was forced to return with an Ilkhan army. Also during Abu Sa'id's lifetime, Sharaf al-Din was imprisoned in Tabriz for a failed attempt to murder his successor.\n\nWith the death of Abu Sa'id in 1335, Arpa Ke'un took the throne. He had Sharaf al-Din executed; two of Sharaf's sons in the royal encampment (Amir Jalal al-Din Mas'ud Shah, who fled to Hasan Buzurg; Shaikh Abu Ishaq to Amir 'Ali Padishah) withdrew from the scene. Meanwhile, Kai-Khusrau was asserting his authority in Shiraz. When Arpa Ke'un was captured by rebels, he was sent to Mas'ud Shah, who killed him. Mas'ud Shah then served as vizier under the Jalayirid puppet Ilkhan Muhammed Khan; when the latter was killed, he made his way to Shiraz. The two brothers came into conflict, which was only settled when Kai-Khusrau's died (1338/9).\n\nMas'ud Shah was quickly faced with more challenges to his reign. A year after Kai Khusrau's death, a fourth son of Sharaf al-Din named Shams al-Din Muhammad escaped from his brother's prison of Qal'a-yi Saf'id, whereupon he joined the Chobanids. Shams al-Din, together with the Chobanid Pir Hosayn, marched to Shiraz, which they captured. Mas'ud Shah fled to Luristan. Pir Hosayn, however, murdered Shams al-Din; this act lost him support in the city, and he had to withdraw. Pir Hosayn reconquered the city in the next year, however. Mas'ud Shah attempted to take advantage of Chobanid infighting, and allied with Yagi Basti to take the city, which had in the meantime fallen into the hands of Abu Ishaq. He had been given Isfahan by Pir Hosayn, and he now took Shiraz as well. When Yagi Basti murdered Mas'ud Shah that same year, Abu Ishaq became the sole surviving son of Sharaf al-Din. He took Shiraz from Yagi Basti in March 1343.\n\nJamal al-Din Abu Ishaq's goal was to conquer Kerman; he therefore undertook expeditions against the Muzaffarids, who were led by Mubariz al-Din Muhammad. The rivalry between the two heated up during a campaign against the Muzaffarid city of Yazd during 1350 and 1351. In retaliation, Mubariz al-Din invaded Fars in 1352. After defeating the Injuids in battle, he laid siege to Shiraz in 1353. Abu Ishaq, who grew increasingly paranoid, ordered the extermination of two quarters of the city in order to root out traitors. The chief of another quarter, fearing for his people, gave the key for his gate to Mubariz al-Din's son Shah Shuja. Abu Ishaq was forced to surrender, but he escaped and made his way to Isfahan with the support of the Jalayirids. Mubariz al-Din, however, laid siege to that city also, and captured it in 1357. Abu Ishaq again surrendered, was sent to Shiraz, and was executed. The Injuid lands now fell into the hands of the Muzaffarids, who would hold them until the onslaught of Timur forty years later.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104818", "title": "Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center", "text": "Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center\n\nThe Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center () in Barrio Tibes, Ponce municipality, Puerto Rico, houses one of the most important archaeological discoveries made in the Antilles. The discovery provides an insight as to how the indigenous tribes of the Igneri and Taínos lived and played during and before the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the New World. Tibes is the oldest Antillean Indian ceremonial and sports complex yet uncovered in Puerto Rico. Within its boundaries is also the largest indigenous cemetery discovered to date – consisting of 186 human skeletons, most from the Igneri and the rest from the pre-Taíno cultures. Based on the orientation of the ceremonial plazas, this is also believed to be the oldest astronomical observatory in the Antilles. The museum was established in 1982 and restored in 1991.\n\nThe Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is one of the largest and most significant indigenous sites in the Caribbean islands, and is the largest ceremonial site in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe continuous occupation from Igneri to Taíno times, the presence of the large stone constructions, the presence of shell middens and stratified deposits, all afford an opportunity to investigate some of the major substantive and theoretical problems in Caribbean archeology. Besides lending itself to the traditional problems of culture, history and chronology, the site provides the ideal setting for the study of the cultural processes responsible for the transition from Igneri to Taíno cultural manifestation. There has been some controversy in the literature as to whether there was a direct unilinear, \"in situ\", transition from one to the other or whether the two manifestations actually represent two different groups. The data at this site can contribute significantly to the resolution of this research problem, as well as to other basic questions pertaining to the changes in sociopolitical organization which may have gone along with the changes evidenced in the material culture.\n\nThe site also lends itself to the study of problems relating to extra-Antillean influences on the Caribbean. The evidence from the site indicates that possible influences from Mesoamerica, e.g. the ball game, are in evidence in Puerto Rico as early as 700 A.D. The presence of shell middens and refuse heaps at the site will afford an opportunity to study subsistence patterns as well as possibly some information on the paleo-environment. The burials and associated grave goods will provide an insight into social, religious, ceremonial/symbolic systems of these occupants, as well as provide information on prehistoric demographic patterns, nutrition, disease and other prehistoric population characteristics.\n\nOver 186 human remains were found within the boundaries of the ceremonial center, in what is considered to be the largest indigenous cemetery in the region. Most of the remains were from the Igneri Culture and DNA samples have been taken from the remains for further studies. Information such as the ceremonies, eating habits, ceramic styles and much more has been provided from these remains and from the excavations.\n\nThe site is now a tourist attraction which was opened to the public on 30 April 1982. Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and at the Ponce Museum of Art.\n\nIt was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 14 April 1978. It is known as the \"Centro Ceremonial Indígena de Tibes\".\n\nThe Centro Ceremonial Indigena at Tibes, Ponce, Puerto Rico, was discovered during the days after heavy rain downpours. The survey was conducted by the Sociedad Guaynia de Arqueologia e Historia and was sponsored by the Puerto Rico Institute of Culture. Clearing the area's high brush revealed a number of shell middens, as well as the major features of the site which were the carefully laid out stone constructions traditionally referred to as ball courts.\n\nA total of seven ball courts and a quadrangular plaza are distributed throughout the site. Five of the ball courts are rectangular, consisting of two parallel lines of flat stones and open at both ends. The remaining two ball courts are U-shaped, bounded on each side by a walk paved with flat river cobbles and boulders. Another major feature of the site is a series of triangular stone arrangements surrounding a flat excavated area.\n\nThe main feature of the site is the nearly quadrangular enclosure which has been called a plaza. It is bounded on two sides by a walk paved with flat stones while the other two sides are defined with flat slabs. Many of the stones surrounding the plaza bear petroglyphs. The terrain within the ball courts and plaza have been artificially modified. Several shell middens are scattered irregularly throughout the site and is some instances the ball courts intrude into them, indicating that the site was occupied for an extended period of time with a gradual evolution into a ceremonial center.\n\nA number of test pits have been excavated to establish an absolute and relative chronology as well as to define the potential for the site. These indicate that the site was originally occupied by the earliest agricultural immigrants into the greater Antilles, the Igneri. Radiocarbon dates and pottery analyses have revealed a continuous period of occupation between 400 A.D. and 1000 A.D. The last inhabitants of the site were presumably the Taínos.\n\nThe Taínos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and recreational, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators) and ball playing.\n\nAccording to the eyewitness account of Spanish historian Pedro Martir de Angleria, the body strength games were played in front of the whole village in the presence of the \"Cacique\" (Chief) and in some occasions an invited guest. Two teams would fight with bows and arrows in defense of their possessions as if they were enemies. In one of the events, witnessed by Angleria, four men died and many others were injured in the space of one hour. The contest would come to an end only if the Cacique gave the ending signal.\n\nThe ball game, called \"Batey\", was played in the ceremonial ball court, which they also called a \"Batey\", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a \"U\". The ball was called Batu and made of rubber and vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. One team to the west and the other to the east. The fathers and sons played on the opposite teams. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas the game was played in the following manner: \"One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.\n\nThe site was discovered in 1975 in the aftermath of Hurricane Eloise. In that year, archaeologists from the Guaynia Society of Archaeology and History at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico, members of the Archaeological Society of the Southwest, announced the discovery of the ruins of a \"Batey\" in barrio Tibes, on the northern outskirts of the city of Ponce. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered buried under thick forest overgrowth, dating back to AD 25 in the area which is now known as \"Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes\" (The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center). The fields varied in size from 12.8 meters (42 ft) long by 10.9 meters (35.8 ft) wide to 35.1 meters (115 ft) long by 9.3 meters (30.5 ft) wide.\n\nAccording to archeologists, the ball parks and ceremonial centers were built by the Igneri Culture, a Pre-Taíno tribe which inhabited the island. Modern technology tells us that the area was populated in 25 AD and that the Igneri abandoned the area in 600 AD for some unknown reason or reasons. The Taínos populated the same area in 1000 AD.\n\nAccording to archaeologist Osvaldo Garcia Goyco, there is evidence that some of the plazas are oriented in relation to the equinox and solstices of the four seasons of the year. This is not unusual since the Taínos cultivated their crops in accordance to their astrological observations. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is the oldest astronomical observatory in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Taínos had their own culture, customs and governing structure. Besides using the fields for ball playing, they would also use the plazas to celebrate the \"\"Areyto\"\" which was a celebration consisting of telling an oral history told by singing and dancing accompanied by music. Most of the knowledge and information that we have about the traditions of the Taínos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas. Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described an \"Areyto\" in the following manner: \"And on this island what I could understand was that their songs which they call \"areytos\", were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three or four hours or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from one day to the next.\"\n\nWhen the Spaniards arrived in the island one of their first actions was to forcibly convert the Taínos into Christianity. They considered the ceremonial and religious practices of the Taínos as uncivilized and a form of paganism. The Taínos were enslaved and forced to build fortifications and to work the mines. Many died because of this harsh treatment, and also because of the introduction to diseases such as smallpox to the island by the Spaniards. However, before the Taíno tribes ceased to exist in Puerto Rico, Spanish historians such as Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, were able to witness and record the life and customs of these people.\n\nThe continued restoration of Tibes by archaeologists is not an easy one. The following are some factors that are taken into consideration:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2104830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104830", "title": "Cursor (user interface)", "text": "Cursor (user interface)\n\nIn computer user interfaces, a cursor is an indicator used to show the current position for user interaction on a computer monitor or other display device that will respond to input from a text input or pointing device. The mouse cursor is also called a pointer, owing to its resemblance in usage to a pointing stick.\n\nCursor is Latin for 'runner.' A cursor is the name given to the transparent slide engraved with a hairline that is used for marking a point on a slide rule. The term was then transferred to computers through analogy.\n\nIn most command-line interfaces or text editors, the text cursor, also known as a caret, is an underscore, a solid rectangle, or a vertical line, which may be flashing or steady, indicating where text will be placed when entered (the insertion point). In text mode displays, it was not possible to show a vertical bar between characters to show where the new text would be inserted, so an underscore or block cursor was used instead. In situations where a block was used, the block was usually created by inverting the pixels of the character using the boolean math exclusive or function. On text editors and word processors of modern design on bitmapped displays, the vertical bar is typically used instead.\n\nIn a typical text editing application, the cursor can be moved by pressing various keys. These include the four arrow keys, the Page Up and Page Down keys, the Home key, the End key, and various key combinations involving a modifier key such as the Control key. The position of the cursor also may be changed by moving the mouse pointer to a different location in the document and clicking.\n\nThe blinking of the text cursor is usually temporarily suspended when it is being moved; otherwise, the cursor may change position when it is not visible, making its location difficult to follow.\n\nSome interfaces use an underscore or thin vertical bar to indicate that the user is in insert mode, a mode where text will be inserted in the middle of the existing text, and a larger block to indicate that the user is in overtype mode, where inserted text will overwrite existing text. In this way, a block cursor may be seen as a piece of selected text one character wide, since typing will replace the text \"in\" the cursor with the new text.\n\nA vertical line text cursor with a small left-pointing or right-pointing appendage are for indicating the direction of text flow on systems that support bi-directional text, and is thus usually known among programmers as a 'bidi cursor'. In some cases, the cursor may split into two parts, each indicating where left-to-right and right-to-left text would be inserted.\n\nThe pointer or mouse cursor echoes movements of the pointing device, commonly a mouse, touchpad or trackball.\nThis kind of cursor is used to manipulate elements of graphical user interfaces such as menus, buttons, scrollbars or any other widget. It may be called a \"mouse pointer,\" because the mouse is the dominant type of pointing device used with desktop computers.\n\nThe I-beam pointer (also called the I-cursor) is a cursor shaped like a serifed capital letter \"I\". The purpose of this cursor is to indicate that the text beneath the cursor can be highlighted, and sometimes inserted or changed.\n\nThe idea of a cursor being used as a marker or insertion point for new data or transformations, such as rotation, can be extended to a 3D modeling environment. Blender, for instance, uses a 3D cursor to determine where future operations are to take place.\n\n\n"}

GEM series boosters were previously used on the Delta II, Delta III, and Delta IV. They will fly on Atlas V, Vulcan, and the proposed OmegA.\n\nThe GEM-63 is being developed as a drop-in replacement for the Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ-60A booster used on the Atlas V. The Atlas V will begin flying with the GEM-63 in 2020 with the STP-3 launch.\n\nThe GEM-63XL is about 5 feet longer than the regular GEM-63 and will be used on the Vulcan, OmegA launch vehicles starting in 2021.\n\nGEM-63XL offers higher performance at almost half the cost of the AJ-60A boosters currently being used on the Atlas V.\n\nThe GEM-40 is a SRM used on Delta II beginning in 1990. The use of composite materials allowed for booster casings lighter than the steel casings of the Castor 4 SRMs they replaced. The first flight of a GEM-40 occurred in 1990 on a Delta II 7925. Delta II vehicles can use three, four, or nine GEM-40s. When using three or four boosters, all GEM-40s ignite on the ground, while on Delta IIs using nine boosters six are ignited on the ground, and the remaining three are ignited in the air when the first six burn out.\n\nOn August 5, 1995, an air-lit GEM-40 failed to separate from a Delta II 7925 carrying Koreasat 1. The excess mass of the booster resulted in the satellite reaching a lower than intended transfer orbit, which it was able to compensate for using on-board propellant.\n\nOn January 17, 1997, a Delta II (Delta 241) exploded due to a catastrophic failure in a GEM-40. The failure triggered the launch vehicle's self-destruct function 13 seconds after ignition. An Air Force investigation determined that the motor's casing had been damaged prior to launch, resulting in the casing splitting open soon after ignition.\n\nThe GEM-46 was a lengthened solid motor originally developed for Delta III. This solid motor variant also included thrust vector control (TVC) to help steer the vehicle. After the discontinuation of the Delta III, GEM-46 motors (without TVC) were used on the Delta II to create the Delta II Heavy, which could only be launched from a modified pad at Cape Canaveral. Both Delta III and Delta II-Heavy used nine GEM-46s, with six ignited on the ground and three air-lit.\n\nThe GEM-60 was a solid motor used on the Delta IV family of launch vehicles, available with and without Thrust Vector Control (TVC). A Delta IV Medium+ can use two or four GEM-60s, and was retired after the launch of a GPS-III satellite which launched on 22 August 2019.\n\n"}

{"id": "2104836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104836", "title": "Cursor (databases)", "text": "Cursor (databases)\n\nIn computer science, a database cursor is a control structure that enables traversal over the records in a database. Cursors facilitate subsequent processing in conjunction with the traversal, such as retrieval, addition and removal of database records. The database cursor characteristic of traversal makes cursors akin to the programming language concept of iterator.\n\nCursors are used by database programmers to process individual rows returned by database system queries. Cursors enable manipulation of whole result sets at once. In this scenario, a cursor enables the sequential processing of rows in a result set.\n\nIn SQL procedures, a cursor makes it possible to define a result set (a set of data rows) and perform complex logic on a row by row basis. By using the same mechanics, a SQL procedure can also define a result set and return it directly to the caller of the SQL procedure or to a client application.\n\nA cursor can be viewed as a pointer to one row in a set of rows. The cursor can only reference one row at a time, but can move to other rows of the result set as needed.\n\nTo use cursors in SQL procedures, you need to do the following:\n\nTo work with cursors you must use the following SQL statements\n\nThis section introduces the ways the standard defines how to use cursors in applications in embedded SQL. Not all application bindings for relational database systems adhere to that standard, and some (such as CLI or JDBC) use a different interface.\n\nA programmer makes a cursor known to the DBMS by using a codice_1 ... codice_2 statement and assigning the cursor a (compulsory) name:\n\nBefore code can access the data, it must open the cursor with the codice_3 statement. Directly following a successful opening, the cursor is positioned \"before\" the first row in the result set.\n\nApplications position cursors on a specific row in the result set with the codice_4 statement. A fetch operation transfers the data of the row into the application.\n\nOnce an application has processed all available rows or the fetch operation is to be positioned on a non-existing row (compare scrollable cursors below), the DBMS returns a SQLSTATE '02000' (usually accompanied by an +100) to indicate the end of the result set.\n\nThe final step involves closing the cursor using the codice_5 statement:\n\nAfter closing a cursor, a program can open it again, which implies that the DBMS re-evaluates the same query or a different query and builds a new result set.\n\nProgrammers may declare cursors as scrollable or not scrollable. The scrollability indicates the direction in which a cursor can move.\n\nWith a non-scrollable (or forward-only) cursor, you can codice_4 each row at most once, and the cursor automatically moves to the next row. After you fetch the last row, if you fetch again, you will put the cursor after the last row and get the following code: SQLSTATE 02000 (SQLCODE +100).\n\nA program may position a scrollable cursor anywhere in the result set using the codice_4 SQL statement. The keyword SCROLL must be specified when declaring the cursor. The default is codice_8, although different language bindings like JDBC may apply a different default.\n\nThe target position for a scrollable cursor can be specified relatively (from the current cursor position) or absolutely (from the beginning of the result set).\n\nScrollable cursors can potentially access the same row in the result set multiple times. Thus, data modifications (insert, update, delete operations) from other transactions could affect the result set. A cursor can be SENSITIVE or INSENSITIVE to such data modifications. A sensitive cursor picks up data modifications affecting the result set of the cursor, and an insensitive cursor does not. Additionally, a cursor may be INSENSITIVE, in which case the DBMS tries to apply sensitivity as much as possible.\n\nCursors are usually closed automatically at the end of a transaction, i.e. when a COMMIT or ROLLBACK (or an implicit termination of the transaction) occurs. That behavior can be changed if the cursor is declared using the WITH HOLD clause (the default is WITHOUT HOLD). A holdable cursor is kept open over COMMIT and closed upon ROLLBACK. (Some DBMS deviate from this standard behavior and also keep holdable cursors open over ROLLBACK.)\n\nWhen a COMMIT occurs, a holdable cursor is positioned \"before\" the next row. Thus, a positioned UPDATE or positioned DELETE statement will only succeed after a FETCH operation occurred first in the transaction.\n\nNote that JDBC defines cursors as holdable per default. This is done because JDBC also activates auto-commit per default.\n\nCursors can not only be used to fetch data from the DBMS into an application but also to identify a row in a table to be updated or deleted. The SQL:2003 standard defines positioned update and positioned delete SQL statements for that purpose. Such statements do not use a regular WHERE clause with predicates. Instead, a cursor identifies the row. The cursor must be opened and already positioned on a row by means of codice_4 statement.\n\nThe cursor must operate on an updatable result set in order to successfully execute a positioned update or delete statement. Otherwise, the DBMS would not know how to apply the data changes to the underlying tables referred to in the cursor.\n\nUsing cursors in distributed transactions (X/Open XA Environments), which are controlled using a transaction monitor, is no different from cursors in non-distributed transactions.\n\nOne has to pay attention when using holdable cursors, however. Connections can be used by different applications. Thus, once a transaction has been ended and committed, a subsequent transaction (running in a different application) could inherit existing holdable cursors. Herefore, an application developer has to be aware of that situation.\n\nThe XQuery language allows cursors to be created using the subsequence() function.\n\nThe format is:\n\nlet $displayed-sequence := subsequence($result, $start, $item-count)\nWhere $result is the result of the initial XQuery, $start is the item number to start and $item-count is the number of items to return.\n\nEquivalently this can also be done using a predicate:\nlet $displayed-sequence := $result[$start to $end]\nWhere codice_10 is the end sequence.\n\nFor complete examples see the .\n\nThe following information may vary depending on the specific database system.\n\nFetching a row from the cursor may result in a network round trip each time. This uses much more network bandwidth than would ordinarily be needed for the execution of a single SQL statement like DELETE. Repeated network round trips can severely reduce the speed of the operation using the cursor. Some DBMSs try to reduce this effect by using block fetch. Block fetch implies that multiple rows are sent together from the server to the client. The client stores a whole block of rows in a local buffer and retrieves the rows from there until that buffer is exhausted.\n\nCursors allocate resources on the server, such as locks, packages, processes, and temporary storage. For example, Microsoft SQL Server implements cursors by creating a temporary table and populating it with the query's result set. If a cursor is not properly closed (\"deallocated\"), the resources will not be freed until the SQL session (connection) itself is closed. This wasting of resources on the server can lead to performance degradations and failures.\n\nEMPLOYEES TABLE\n\nSQL> desc EMPLOYEES_DETAILS;\n\nSAMPLE CURSOR KNOWN AS EE\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE \nPROCEDURE EE AS\nBEGIN\n\nDECLARE\n\nCursor c_EMPLOYEES_DETAILS IS\n\nBEGIN\n\nEND;\n\nEND;\n\n\n"}

In the garden centre, Mark was saying ‘What are you looking at, why have you got that pond mould upside down?’, and I’m just looking at its contours thinking I can probably press something in that!”\n\n– Mo Constantine\n\nThe original bath bomb was patented by the Constantines in 1989 under the brand name 'Cosmetics To Go'. However, when the company went into administration, the couple lost the patent. In 2014, a new patent was issued to Cosmetic Warriors LTD (the proprietor of the Lush Cosmetics trademark) protecting the process of creating a bath bomb with distinct layers.\n\nBath bombs' primary ingredients are a weak acid and a bicarbonate base. These are unreactive when dry, but react vigorously when dissolved in water to produce their characteristic fizzing over a period of several minutes. This is an acid-base reaction that involves conversion of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate to sodium citrate and carbon dioxide:\n\nCHOCOH + NaHCO → CHOCONa + HO + CO\n\nThe other ingredients in bath bombs can vary considerably. However, most have scented ingredients as well as dye to impart a pleasant fragrance and color to bathwater. Lathering agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, are also often added to create bubble foams.\n\nBath bombs are generally spherical but can be found in a variety of shapes, such as tablets or lumps. Shops offer a wide range of bombs, but they can also be made at home. Some companies use bath bomb machines to increase their bath bomb production rates. These machines can make up to hundreds of bath bombs per hour.\n\nAlthough bath bombs are well tolerated by many people, some additives such as fragrances and dyes can cause irritation. Common skin irritants and allergens found in bath bombs include limonene, linalool and sodium lauryl sulfate. The main ingredients—citric acid and sodium bicarbonate—are generally not considered as skin irritants when used as bath additives because of significant dilution in water.\n"}

He is regarded as a master of the hammered dulcimer, and is also proficient on many other instruments including guitar, banjo, autoharp, mountain dulcimer, fiddle, and Jew's harp. He has received six Grammy Award nominations.\n\nMcCutcheon was born to Roman Catholic parents in Wausau, Wisconsin. He attended Saint James Grade School and graduated from Newman Catholic High School. He is a graduate of Saint John's University in Minnesota. While in his 20s, he travelled to Appalachia and learned from some of the legendary greats of traditional folk music, such as Roscoe Holcomb, I.D. Stamper, and Tommy Hunter. His vast repertoire also includes songs from contemporary writers like Si Kahn (e.g. \"Gone Gonna Rise Again\", \"Rubber Blubber Whale\") as well as a large body of his own music.\n\nWhen McCutcheon became a father in the early 1980s he found most children's music \"unmusical and condescending\", and sought to change the situation by releasing a children's album, \"Howjadoo\", in 1983. Originally, he had only intended to do one children's record, but the popularity of this first effort led to the production of seven additional children's albums. He has also written three books for children.\n\nMuch of his work, however, continues to focus on writing politically and socially conscious songs for adult audiences. One of his most successful songs, \"Christmas in the Trenches\" (from his 1984 album \"Winter Solstice\"), tells the story of the Christmas truce of 1914. \nIn his performances, McCutcheon often introduces his music with a story. He has become known as a storyteller, and has made multiple appearances at the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, Tennessee. He is married to children's author and storyteller, Carmen Agra Deedy.\n\nMcCutcheon's music has, since the 1990s, increasingly evolved into heartland rock-influenced ballads, while he still occasionally performs purer folk music, particularly when playing the dulcimer.\n\nIn 2011 McCutcheon portrayed IWW organizer and songwriter Joe Hill in Si Kahn's one-man play \"Joe Hill's Last Will\", produced by Main Stage West in Sebastopol, California.\n\n\n\nJohn McCutcheon has received six Grammy nominations.\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the\nNational Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\n"}

A saltbox has just one story in the back and two stories in the front. The flat front and central chimney are recognizable features, but the asymmetry of the unequal sides and the long, low rear roof line are the most distinctive features of a saltbox, which takes its name from its resemblance to a wooden lidded box in which salt was once kept.\n\nThe saltbox originated in New England and is an example of American colonial architecture. Folklore holds that the saltbox form was popularized by Queen Anne's taxation of houses greater than one story. Since the rear of the roof descended to the height of a single-story building, the structure was exempt from the tax. Actually, the saltbox shape evolved organically from the need for additional space for growing families; adding a lean-to was an economical way to enlarge the house. All but two of the examples below predate Queen Anne.\n\nThe roof style is also known as a catslide roof – any roof that, on one side, extends down below the main eave height, providing greater area under the roof without an increase in the ridge height.\n\nThe earliest saltbox houses were created when a lean-to addition was added onto the rear of the original house, extending the roof line sometimes to less than six feet from ground level. Old weathered clapboards are still in place on parts of the original rear exterior walls of some of the earliest New England saltbox houses (see images). The hand-riven oak clapboards on both the Comfort Starr House and Ephraim Hawley House are preserved in place in the attic that was created when the lean-to was added onto the original house. The style was popular for structures throughout the colonial period and into the early Republic, perhaps because of the simplicity of its design.\n\nSaltbox homes can also be found in parts of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nMost early saltboxes, as with many other types of New England colonial houses, are timber-frame. Timber framing, or post-and-beam construction, involves joining large pieces of wood with woodworking joints, such as mortise-and-tenon joints, or with wooden pegs, braces, or trusses. Metal nails were sparingly used, as they were an expensive commodity at the time. The exterior of a saltbox was often finished with clapboard or other wooden siding. The Josiah Day House in West Springfield, Massachusetts, is constructed of brick.\n\n\n"}

It lies north of the district of Morvern and east of the district of Sunart. Administratively it is now part of the ward management area of Lochaber, in Highland council area. It forms part of the traditional shire and current registration county of Argyll.\n\nThe modern term Ardgour, together with Kingairloch, is applied to a large area of countryside around the village, from the Glensanda Superquarry, Kingairloch and Kilmalieu in the south and west (bordering Morvern and Sunart districts), up to Conaglen, Stroncreggan, Treslaig, Camasnagaul, Achaphubuil, Blaich, Duisky, Garvan and Drumfin in the north (bordering Glenfinnan).\n\nUntil 1829 Ardgour was part of Kilmallie Parish - the largest in Scotland - at which time a Quoad Sacra Parish (QSP) - 'Ballachulish & Corran of Ardgour' - was formed, together with Ballachulish, in Inverness-shire across Loch Linnhe. Parliamentary churches were built at Creag Mhòr, (north) Ballachulish and at Corran, Ardgour with the Manse at the former in Onich. 'Ardgour' and 'Ballachulish & Onich' became Parishes in their own rights in 1894. Ardgour took in Kingairloch when this was dis-joined from Lismore and Appin Parish in 1911.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1975 Ardgour formed part of the (civil) landward district of Ardnamurchan in Argyll. From 1975 it was subsumed civilly into the Lochaber District of Highland (Region)\n\nThe area is served by the A861 road. The easiest access from the A82 (Glasgow - Inverness Trunk road) is via a short ferry crossing from Corran to Ardgour; the alternative is a trip around Loch Linnhe and Loch Eil. The ferry runs every half-hour from about 6:30 am (8:45 am on Sunday) until about 9:30 pm and costs £8.00 per PLG vehicle (wef 1 Apr 2018) for a single ticket - passengers/pedestrians free.

Built from 1852 to 1855, the statehouse was initially intended as a larger structure, but only the south wing was completed before the project was abandoned due to lack of federal funding, and the Utah Territorial Legislature only met in the building once before the capital was moved to Salt Lake City in 1856.\n\nIn 1851, Mormon leader Brigham Young and a group of lawmakers determined that Fillmore should become the capital of the provisional State of Deseret because of its central location. When the Congress of the United States turned down their petition for statehood and created the Utah Territory instead, Fillmore was designated as its territorial capital.\n\nThe original statehouse building plans called for four wings connected by a Moorish dome at the center, but only the south wing was completed. U.S. President Millard Fillmore had helped secure the first $20,000 for construction, but could not help the territory secure additional funding after he lost the next election. (Both Fillmore and the county in which it sits, Millard County, were named in honor of President Fillmore.) In 1856, after housing its first and only full session, the Territorial Statehouse was abandoned by the Utah Legislature in favor of a new location in Utah's largest city, Salt Lake City.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the building was vacant, decaying and threatened with demolition. During the 1920s, the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers (DUP) proposed restoring the statehouse to serve as a history museum. Under the direction of the Utah State Park and Recreation Commission, the museum opened in 1930 and was placed in the custodial care of the DUP. The statehouse and grounds became a state park in 1957. Today, the Territorial Statehouse serves as a museum which contains many artifacts from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Two restored cabins and a pioneer stone schoolhouse are also located on the grounds.\n\nUtah's governor, Jon Huntsman, Jr. delivered his State of the State address from the Territorial Statehouse in 2005 while the State Capitol was undergoing renovations. The State of the State address in 2005 was the first official use of the Territorial Statehouse for a Utah Governmental Function since 1856.\n\n Because they expected the red stone exterior to be covered with stucco, the stoneworkers who constructed the statehouse carved their initials into several of the stones on the outside of the building. Those initials are still visible today. The south exterior wall bears a plaque from the National Register of Historic Places. According to the plaque, the building was used by the 5th, 6th and 8th Legislatures who served in 1855, 1856, and 1858 respectively. There is also a plaque from the Daughters of Utah Pioneers dated August 3, 1935 that reads:\n\nCreating Fillmore City and Millard County the territorial legislature of Utah selected Pahvant Valley as capitol site Oct. 29, 1851. This spot was selected by Governor Brigham Young. Construction work began in 1852. Truman O. Angell, architect and Anson Call, supervisor. This south wing was used by the Fifth Territorial Legislature Oct. 10, 1855. In 1856 the seat of government was moved to Salt Lake City. Later used as court house and county headquarters.

Upon graduation, he worked as a school teacher and later became Director of Education. In 1975, he was appointed Papua New Guinea's first Consul General in Australia. From 1975 to 1979, he also served as High Commissioner. Together with Ted Diro, he founded the People's Action Party in 1986 and was elected to the National Parliament.\n\nHe succeeded Kingsford Dibela as Governor-General of Papua New Guinea on 27 February 1990 and was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. Shortly after taking office, he was faced with a constitutional crisis. Ted Diro, now the Deputy Prime Minister, had been found guilty of corruption. The constitution required the Governor-General to dismiss him, but he did not. This created some controversy, and there were calls for Eri himself to leave office, which he did not. Ultimately, Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu sent a formal request to Queen Elizabeth II to replace him.\n\nOn 4 October 1991, before Namaliu's request could be acted upon, Eri resigned from office. He died at his home in Port Moresby on 25 May 1993, aged 57, leaving six children.\n\nHe is often cited as being the first Papua New Guinean national to publish a book in English; \"The Crocodile\" (a novel), which was published in 1970.

{"id": "2104972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104972", "title": "Cades Cove", "text": "Cades Cove\n\nCades Cove is an isolated valley located in the Tennessee section of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. The valley was home to numerous settlers before the formation of the national park. Today Cades Cove, the single most popular destination for visitors to the park, attracts more than two million visitors a year because of its well preserved homesteads, scenic mountain views, and abundant display of wildlife. The Cades Cove Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGeologically, Cades Cove is a type of valley known as a \"limestone window\", created by erosion that removed the older Precambrian sandstone, exposing the younger Paleozoic limestone beneath. More weathering-resistant formations, such as the Cades sandstone which underlies Rich Mountain to the north and the Elkmont and Thunderhead sandstones which form the Smokies crest to the south surround the cove, leaving it relatively isolated within the Smokies. As with neighboring limestone windows such as Tuckaleechee to the north and Wear Cove to the east, the weathering of the limestone produced deep, fertile soil, making Cades Cove attractive to early farmers.\n\nThe majority of the rocks that make up Cades Cove are unaltered sedimentary rocks formed between 340 million and 570 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. The Precambrian rocks that comprise the high ridges surrounding the cove are Ocoee Supergroup sandstones, formed approximately one billion years ago. The mountains themselves were formed between 200 million and 400 million years ago during the Appalachian orogeny, when the North American and African plates collided, thrusting the older rock formations over the younger formations.\n\nThe fracturing and weathering of the limestone and sandstone in Cades Cove has led to the formation of several caves in the vicinity, the two largest of which are Gregory's Cave and Bull Cave. Bull Cave, at 924 feet (281 m), is the deepest cave in Tennessee. Trilobite and brachiopod fossils have been found in Gregory's Cave.\n\nThe entrance to Gregory's Cave is approximately wide and high. The cave consists primarily of one large passage that averages 20 to wide and high. This passage is long and a side passage to the right (south) is developed about from the entrance. This side passage ends after about . In the vicinity of this side passage are \"tally marks\" on the wall, which were typically left by saltpeter miners. The dirt on this side of the cave has been excavated and removed and pick marks are still visible in the dirt. Saltpeter mining occurred in this region from the late 18th century through the Civil War, so this mining activity must have occurred sometime between 1818, when settlers arrived in Cades Cove and 1865, the end of the Civil War. Since this is a relatively small cave and the amount of dirt in the cave was not extensive, this would have been a small mining operation.\n\nGregory's Cave is the only cave in the national park that was ever developed as a commercial cave. The cave was opened to the public in July 1925. After the Gregory property was bought for the national park in 1935, the Gregory family was given a \"lifetime dowry\" and the owner, J. J. Gregory's wife, Elvira, was allowed to live there until her death on March 26, 1943. One of her sons was allowed to remain on the property until he harvested his crop in the fall of 1943, after which the property was completely owned by the National Park Service.\n\nDonald K. MacKay, a geologist with the National Park Service, reported that the Gregory family was still showing the cave commercially as late as 1935. At that time the admission price was 50 cents for adults and children were admitted free.\n\nDuring its history as a commercial cave, Gregory's Cave had walkways, which were made of wood in some places, and electric lights. Wesley Herman Gregory, son of J. J. Gregory, reported that the lighting system was a \"Delco System\" This may have been a generator producing electricity for the lights inside the cave.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Gregory's Cave was designated as a fallout shelter, with an assigned capacity of 1,000 people. The cave was stocked with food, water, and other emergency supplies.\n\nGregory's Cave is now securely gated and entrance is by permit only from the National Park Service. Entrance is generally restricted to scientific researchers.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, the Cherokee used two main trails to cross the Smokies from North Carolina to Tennessee en route to the Overhill settlements. One was the Indian Gap Trail, which connected the Rutherford Indian Trace in the Balsam Mountains to the Great Indian Warpath in modern-day Sevier County. The other was a lower trail that crested at Ekaneetlee Gap, a col just east of Gregory Bald. This trail traversed Cades Cove and Tuckaleechee Cove before proceeding along to Great Tellico and other Overhill towns along the Little Tennessee River. European traders were using these trails as early as 1740.\n\nBy 1797 (and probably much earlier), the Cherokee had established a settlement in Cades Cove known as \"Tsiya'hi,\" or \"Otter Place.\" This village, which may have been little more than a seasonal hunting camp, was located somewhere along the flats of Cove Creek. Henry Timberlake, an early explorer in East Tennessee, reported that streams in this area were stocked with otter, although the otter was extinct in the cove by the time the first European settlers arrived.\n\nCades Cove was named after a Tsiya'hi leader known as Chief Kade. Little is known of Chief Kade, although his existence was verified by a European trader named Peter Snider (1776–1867), who settled nearby Tuckaleechee Cove. Abrams Creek, which flows through the cove, was named after another local chief, Abraham of Chilhowee. A now-discredited theory suggested that the cove was named after Abraham's wife, Kate.\n\nIn 1819, The Treaty of Calhoun ended all Cherokee claims to the Smokies, and Tsiya'hi was abandoned shortly thereafter. The Cherokee would linger in the surrounding forests, however, occasionally attacking settlers until 1838 when they were removed to the Oklahoma Territory (see Trail of Tears).\n\nJohn Oliver (1793–1863), a veteran of the War of 1812, and his wife Lurena Frazier (1795–1888) were the first permanent European settlers in Cades Cove. The Olivers, originally from Carter County, Tennessee, arrived in 1818, accompanied by Joshua Jobe, who had initially persuaded them to settle in the cove. While Jobe returned to Carter County, \nthe Olivers stayed, struggling through the winter and subsisting on dried pumpkin given to them by friendly Cherokees. Jobe returned in the Spring of 1819 with a herd of cattle in tow, and gave the Olivers two milk cows to ease their complaints.\n\nIn 1821, William \"Fighting Billy\" Tipton (1761–1849), a veteran of the American Revolution and son of State of Franklin opponent John Tipton, bought up large tracts of Cades Cove which he in turn sold to his sons and relatives, and settlement began to boom. In the 1820s, Peter Cable, a farmer of German descent, arrived in the cove and designed an elaborate system of dykes and sluices that helped drain the swampy lands in the \nwestern part of the cove. In 1827, Daniel Foute opened the Cades Cove Bloomery Forge to fashion metal tools. Robert Shields arrived in the cove in 1835, and would erect a tub mill on Forge Creek. His son, Frederick, built the cove's first grist mill. Other early settlers would build houses on the surrounding mountains, among them Russell Gregory (1795–1864), for whom Gregory Bald is named, and James Spence, for whom Spence Field is named.\n\nBetween 1820 and 1850, the population of Cades Cove grew to 671, with the size of cove farms averaging between 150 and 300 acres (0.6 and 1.2 km²). The early cove residents, although relatively self-sufficient, were dependent upon nearby Tuckaleechee Cove for dry goods and other necessities.\n\nThe isolation often attributed to Cades Cove is probably exaggerated. A post office was established in the cove in 1833, and Sevierville post master Philip Seaton set up a weekly mail route to the cove in 1839. Cades Cove had telephone service as early as the 1890s, when Dan Lawson and several neighbors built a phone line to Maryville. By the 1850s, various roads connected Cades Cove with Tuckaleechee and Montvale Springs, some of which are still maintained as seasonal passes or hiking trails.\n\nReligion was an important part of life in Cades Cove from its earliest days, a reflection of the efforts of John and Lucretia Oliver. The Olivers managed to organize a branch of the Miller's Cove Baptist Church for Cades Cove in 1825. After briefly realigning themselves with the Wear's Cove Baptist Church, the Cades Cove Baptist Church was pronounced an independent entity in 1829.\n\nIn the 1830s, a division in Baptist churches known as the Anti-mission Split occurred throughout East Tennessee. The split developed over disagreement about whether missions and other \"innovations of the day\" \nwere authorized by Scripture. This debate made its way to Cades Cove Baptist Church in 1839, becoming so emotionally charged as to require the intervention of the Tennessee Association of United Baptists. In the end, thirteen members of the congregation \ndeparted to form the Cades Cove Missionary Baptist Church later that year, and the remaining congregation changed its name in 1841 to the Primitive Baptist Church. The Primitive Baptists believe in a strict, literal interpretation of Scripture. William Howell Oliver (1857–1940), pastor of the Primitive Baptist Church from 1882 to \n1940, explained:\nWe believe that Jesus Christ Himself instituted the Church, that it was perfect at the start, suitably adopted in its organization to every age of the world, to every locality of earth, to every state and condition of the world, to every state and condition of mankind, without any changes or alterations to suit the times, customs, situations, or localities.\nThe Primitive Baptists remained the dominant religious and political force in the cove with their meetings interrupted only by the Civil War. The Missionary Baptists, with a much smaller congregation, continued to meet intermittently throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe Cades Cove Methodist Church was organized in the 1820s, probably through the efforts of such circuit riders as George Eakin. The Methodist congregation, like that of the Missionary Baptists, was small.\n\nIn the decades before the Civil War, Blount County, Tennessee, was a hotbed of abolitionist activity. The Manumission Society of Tennessee was active in the county as early as 1815, and the Quakers— who were relatively numerous in Blount at the time— were so vehemently opposed to slavery that they fought alongside the Union army, in spite of their pacifist agenda. The founder of Maryville College, Rev. Isaac L. Anderson, was a staunch abolitionist who often gave sermons in Cades Cove. Blount doctor Calvin Post (1803–1873) was believed to have set up an Underground Railroad stop within the cove in the years preceding the war. With such sentiment and influence, Cades Cove remained staunchly pro-Union, regardless of the destruction it suffered throughout the war (there were some exceptions, however, such as the cove's affluent entrepreneur and Confederate sympathizer, Daniel Foute).\n\nIn 1863, Confederate bushwhackers from Hazel Creek and other parts of North Carolina began making systematic raids into Cades Cove, stealing livestock and killing any Union supporter they could find. Elijah Oliver (1829–1905), a son of John Oliver and a Union sympathizer, was forced to hide out on Rich Mountain for much of the war. Calvin Post had also gone into hiding, and with the death of John Oliver in 1863, the cove had lost most of its original leaders.\n\nAlthough Federal forces occupied Knoxville in 1863, Confederate raids into Cades Cove continued. A pivotal figure at this time was Russell Gregory, who had originally vowed to remain neutral after his son defected to the Confederate cause. Gregory organized a small militia, composed mostly of the cove's elderly men, and in 1864 ambushed a band of Confederate marauders near the junction of Forge Creek and Abrams Creek. The Confederates were routed and chased back across the Smokies to North Carolina. Although this largely put an end to the raids, a band of Confederates managed to sneak into the cove and kill Gregory just two weeks later.\n\nCades Cove suffered from the effects of the Civil War for most of the rest of the 19th century. Only around 1900 did its population return to pre-war levels. The average farm was much less productive, however, and the cove residents were suspicious of any form of change. It wasn't until the Progressive Era that the cove recovered economically.\n\nThe Chestnut Flats area of Cades Cove, located at the base of Gregory Bald, was well known for producing high-quality corn liquor. Among the more prominent moonshine distillers was Josiah \"Joe Banty\" Gregory (1870–1933), the son of Matilda \"Aunt Tildy\" Shields by her first marriage. The Primitive Baptists, especially William Oliver and his son, John W. Oliver (1878–1966), were fervently opposed to the distilling or consumption of alcohol, and the practice was largely confined to Chestnut Flats. John W. Oliver, a mail carrier in the cove, often found stills on his mail route and reported them to authorities. Oliver would later deride the image of the moonshiner as an integral part of the mountaineer stereotype:\nAll these men are public outlaws, and were never recognized as true, loyal mountaineers or as true American citizens, by the rank and file of the mountain people.\nIn 1921, Josiah Gregory's still was raided by the Blount County sheriff. Although it was later revealed that the sheriff was tipped off by a surveyor in the area, the Gregorys blamed the Olivers. On the night following the raid, the barns of both William and John W. Oliver were burned, destroying a large portion of the family's livestock and tools. Shortly thereafter, Gregory's son was assaulted by Asa and John Sparks after a prank-gone-wrong. In response, Gregory and his brother, Dana, hunted down and shot the Sparks brothers on Christmas night in 1921. Both of the Gregorys were convicted of barn burning and later convicted of felonious assault. After serving only six months, however, they were pardoned and personally escorted home by Governor Austin Peay.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Gregory's Cave may also have been involved in the manufacture of moonshine.\n\nOf all the Smoky Mountain communities, Cades Cove put up the most resistance to the formation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The cove residents were initially assured their land would not be incorporated into the park, and welcomed its formation. By 1927, the winds had changed, however, and when the Tennessee General Assembly passed a bill approving money to buy land for the national park, it gave the Park Commission the power to seize properties within the proposed park boundaries by eminent domain. Long-time residents of Cades Cove were outraged. The head of the Park Commission, Colonel David Chapman, received several threats, including an anonymous phone call warning him that if he ever returned to Cades Cove, he would \"spend the next night in hell.\" Shortly thereafter, Chapman found a sign near the cove's entrance that read {sic}:\nCOL. CHAPMAN: YOU AND HOAST ARE NOTFY, LET THE COVE PEOPL ALONE. GET OUT. GET \nGONE. 40 M. LIMIT. \nThe \"40 mile\" (64 km) limit referred to the distance between Cades Cove and Chapman's hometown of Knoxville. Despite these threats, Chapman initiated a condemnation suit against John W. Oliver in July 1929. The court, however, ruled in favor of Oliver, reasoning that the federal government had never said Cades Cove was essential to the national park. Shortly after the verdict, the Secretary of the Interior officially announced that the cove was necessary, and another condemnation suit was filed. This time, Oliver lost, with the case going all the way to the Tennessee Supreme Court. Oliver would return to court several times over the value of his 375-acre (1.5 km²) tract, which he said was worth $30,000, although the court awarded him just $17,000 plus interest. After attaining a series of one-year leases, Oliver finally abandoned his property on Christmas Day in 1937. The Primitive Baptist Church congregation continued to meet in Cades Cove until the 1960s in defiance of the Park Service, which wanted to develop the land where their church was located.\n\nFor about one hundred years before the creation of the national park, much farming and logging was done in the valley, as the main source of economic development for the people living in the cove, both leading to massive deforestation. At first, the National Park Service planned to let the cove return to its natural forested state. It ultimately yielded to requests by the Great Smoky Mountain Conservation Association to maintain Cades Cove as a meadow. On the advice of contemporary cultural experts such as Hans Huth, the service demolished the more modern structures, leaving only the primitive cabins and barns which were considered most representative of pioneer life in early Appalachia. \n\nCades Cove has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an historic district since July 13, 1977. The historic district is bounded by the elevation contour (that is, it comprises all areas below that elevation) and includes both historic buildings and prehistoric archaeological sites.\n\nThe National Park Service currently maintains several buildings in Cades Cove that are representative of pioneer life in the 19th-century Appalachia. By the time the cove was incorporated into the park, most residents lived in relatively modern frame houses, rather than the log cabins that predominate among the buildings preserved in the cove.\n\nThe following are listed in the order they are approached along the Cades Cove Loop Road:\n\n1. The John Oliver Cabin, constructed c. 1822-1823 by the cove's first permanent European settlers. Dunn reports that the Olivers spent the winter of 1818-1819 in an abandoned Cherokee hut, and built a crude structure the following year. The Oliver cabin was built as a replacement for this first crude structure, which was located a few yards behind the cabin.\n\n2. The Primitive Baptist Church, constructed in 1887. The church was organized as the Cades Cove Baptist Church in 1827, and renamed \"Primitive Baptist\" after the Anti-missions Split in 1841. The Olivers and Russell Gregory are buried in its cemetery.\n\n3. The Cades Cove Methodist Church, constructed in 1902. Methodists were active in the cove as early as the 1820s, and built their first meeting house in 1840.\n\n4. The Cades Cove Missionary Baptist Church, current building constructed in 1915-1916. The church was formed from a small faction of Cades Cove Baptists in 1839 who had broken off from the main church due to the debate over missions, which the Cades Cove Baptists didn't consider authorized by scripture.\n\n5. The Myers Barn, constructed in 1920. The Myers Barn is a more modern-looking hay barn located along the trail to the Elijah Oliver Place.\n\n6. The Elijah Oliver Place, constructed in 1866. Elijah Oliver (1829–1905) was the son of John and Lucretia Oliver. His original farm was destroyed during the U.S. Civil War by Confederate marauders. The homestead includes a dog-trot cabin, a chicken coop, a corn crib, a spring house, and a crude stable.\n\n7. The John Cable Grist Mill, constructed in 1868. John P. Cable (1819–1891), a nephew of Peter Cable, had to construct a series of elaborate diversions along Mill Creek and Forge Creek to get enough water power for the mill's characteristic overshot wheel.\n\n8. The Becky Cable House, constructed in 1879. This building, adjacent to the Cable Mill, was initially used by Leason Gregg as a general store. In 1887, he sold it to John Cable's spinster daughter, Rebecca Cable (1844–1940). A Cable family tradition says that Rebecca never forgave her father and refused to marry after her father broke off one of her childhood romances. Various buildings have been moved from elsewhere in the cove and placed near the Cable mill, including a barn, a carriage house, a chicken coop, a molasses still, a sorghum press, and a replica of a blacksmith shop.\n\n9. The Henry Whitehead Cabin, constructed 1895-1896. This cabin, located on Forge Creek Road near Chestnut Flats, was built by Matilda \"Aunt Tildy\" Shields and her second husband, Henry Whitehead (1851–1914). Shields' sons from her first marriage were prominent figures in the cove's moonshine trade.\n\n10. The Dan Lawson Place, built by Peter Cable in the 1840s and acquired by Dan Lawson (1827–1905) after he married Cable's daughter, Mary Jane. Lawson was the cove's wealthiest resident. The homestead includes a cabin (still called the Peter Cable cabin), a smokehouse, a chicken coop, and a hay barn.\n\n11. The Tipton Place, built in the 1880s by the descendants of Revolutionary War veteran William \"Fighting Billy\" Tipton. The paneling on the house was a later addition. Along with the cabin, the homestead includes a carriage house, a smokehouse, a woodshed, and the oft-photographed double-cantilever barn.\n\n12. The Carter Shields Cabin, a rustic log cabin built in the 1880s.\n\nThough geographically isolated, Cades Cove today is a popular tourist destination in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A one-way, eleven mile (18 km) paved loop around Cades Cove draws thousands of visitors daily. The eleven miles may take more than four hours to traverse and view the sites during tourist season. The cove receives approximately 5 million visitors per year and is the most popular destination in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.\n\nThe cove draws attention for numerous black bear sightings, although many enthusiasts make the trip for the abundant hiking access and the well-preserved 19th-century homesteads. On most days, multiple deer can be seen in the meadows and woods throughout the cove. Popular hiking trails within the cove include the trails to Abrams Falls (a nearly five-mile round trip hike) and Gregory Bald, the latter named after Russell Gregory, a prominent resident of the cove. In addition to hiking and general sightseeing, horseback (see below) and bicycle riding are popular activities.\n\n"}

{"id": "2104998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104998", "title": "DXing", "text": "DXing\n\nDXing is the hobby of receiving and identifying distant radio or television signals, or making two-way radio contact with distant stations in amateur radio, citizens' band radio or other two-way radio communications. Many DXers also attempt to obtain written verifications of reception or contact, sometimes referred to as \"QSLs\" or \"veries\". The name of the hobby comes from DX, telegraphic shorthand for \"distance\" or \"distant\".\n\nThe practice of DXing arose during the early days of radio broadcasting. Listeners would mail \"reception reports\" to radio broadcasting stations in hopes of getting a written acknowledgement or a QSL card that served to officially verify they had heard a distant station. Collecting these cards became popular with radio listeners in the 1920s and 1930s, and reception reports were often used by early broadcasters to gauge the effectiveness of their transmissions. Although international shortwave broadcasts are on the decline, DXing remains popular among dedicated shortwave listeners. The pursuit of two-way contact between distant amateur radio operators is also a significant activity within the amateur radio hobby.\n\nEarly radio listeners, often using home made crystal sets and long wire antennas, found radio stations few and far between. With the broadcast bands uncrowded, signals of the most powerful stations could be heard over hundreds of miles, but weaker signals required more precise tuning or better receiving gear.\n\nBy the 1950s, and continuing through the mid-1970s, many of the most powerful North American \"clear channel\" stations such as KDKA, WLW, CKLW, CHUM, WABC, WJR, WLS, WKBW, KFI, KAAY, KSL and a host of border blasters from Mexico pumped out Top 40 music played by popular disc jockeys. As most smaller, local AM radio stations had to sign off at night, the big 50 kW stations had loyal listeners hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe popularity of DXing the medium-wave band has diminished as the popular music formats quickly migrated to the clearer, though less propagating, FM radio beginning in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the MW band in the United States was getting more and more crowded with new stations and existing stations receiving FCC authorization to operate at night. In Canada, just the opposite occurred as AM stations began moving to FM beginning in the 1980s and continuing through today.\n\nOutside of the Americas and Australia, most AM radio broadcasting was in the form of synchronous networks of government-operated stations, operating with hundreds, even thousands of kilowatts of power. Still, the lower powered stations and occasional trans-oceanic signal were popular DX targets.\n\nEspecially during wartime and times of conflict, reception of international broadcasters, whose signals propagate around the world on the shortwave bands has been popular with both casual listeners and DXing hobbyists.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of streaming audio over the internet, many international broadcasters (including the BBC and Voice of America) have cut back on their shortwave broadcasts. Missionary religious broadcasters still make extensive use of shortwave radio to reach less developed countries around the world.\n\nIn addition to international broadcasters, the shortwave bands also are home to military communications, RTTY, amateur radio, pirate radio, and the mysterious broadcasts of numbers stations. Many of these signals are transmitted in single side band mode, which requires the use of specialized receivers more suitable to DXing than to casual listening.\n\nThough sporadic in nature, signals on the FM broadcast and VHF television bands – especially those stations at the lower end of these bands – can \"skip\" for hundreds, even thousands of miles. North American FM stations have been received in Western Europe, and European TV signals have been received on the West Coast of the U.S.\n\nPolice, fire, and military communications on the VHF bands are also DX'ed to some extent on multi-band radio scanners, though they are mainly listened to strictly on a local basis. One difficulty is in identifying the exact origins of communications of this nature, as opposed to commercial broadcasters which must identify themselves at the top of each hour, and can often be identified through mentions of sponsors, slogans, etc. throughout their programming.\n\nAmateur radio operators who specialize in making two way radio contact with other amateurs in distant countries are also referred to as \"DXers\". On the HF (also known as shortwave) amateur bands, DX stations are those in foreign countries. On the VHF/UHF amateur bands, DX stations can be within the same country or continent, since making a long-distance VHF contact, without the help of a satellite, can be very difficult. DXers collect QSL cards as proof of contact and can earn special certificates and awards from amateur radio organizations. \n\nIn addition, many clubs offer awards for communicating with a certain number of DX stations. For example, the ARRL offers the DX Century Club award, or DXCC. The basic certificate is awarded for working and confirming at least 100 entities on the ARRL DXCC List. For award purposes, other areas than just political countries can be classified as \"DX countries\". For example, the French territory of Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean is counted as a DX country, even though it is a region of France. The rules for determining what is a DX country can be quite complex and to avoid potential confusion, radio amateurs often use the term \"entity\" instead of country. In addition to entities, some awards are based on island groups in the world's oceans. On the VHF/UHF bands, many radio amateurs pursue awards based on Maidenhead grid locators. \n\nIn order to give other amateurs a chance to confirm contacts at new or exotic locations, amateurs have mounted DXpeditions to countries or regions that have no permanent base of amateur radio operators. There are also frequent contests where radio amateurs operate their stations on certain dates for a fixed period of time to try to communicate with as many DX stations as possible.\n\nMany radio enthusiasts are members of DX clubs. There are many DX clubs in many countries around the world. They are useful places to find information about up-to-date news relating to international radio. Many people also enjoy social events, which can form a large part of the enjoyment that people can get out of the radio hobby.\n\nOne of the interesting sides of DXing as a hobby is collecting QSL cards (acknowledgement cards from the broadcaster) confirming the listener's reception report (sometimes called SINPO report, see next section).\n\nUsually a QSL card will have a picture on one side and the reception data on the other. Most of the broadcasters will use pictures and messages indicating their country's culture or technological life.\n\nSINPO stands for the following qualities, graded on a scale of 1 to 5, where '1' means the quality was very bad and '5' very good.\n\nS – Signal strength\nI – Interference with other stations or broadcasters\nN – Noise ratio in the received signal\nP – Propagation (ups and downs of the reception)\nO – Overall merit\n\nAlthough this is a subjective measure, with practise the grading becomes more consistent, and a particular broadcast may be assessed by several listeners from the same area, in which case the broadcaster could assess correspondence between reports.\n\nAfter listening to a broadcast, the listener writes a report with SINPO values, typically including his geographical location (called QTH in amateur radio terminology) in longitude and latitude, the types of receiver and antennae used, the frequency the transmission was heard on, a brief description of the programme listened to, their opinion about it, suggestions if any, and so on.\n\nThe listener can send the report to the broadcaster either by post or email, and request verification (QSL) from them.\n\nVariants of this report are:\na) the SIO report which omits the Noise and Propagation,\nb) grading on a scale of 1 to 3 (instead of 1 to 5) and\nc) the SINFO report where the F stands for fading.\n\nDX communication is communication over large or relatively uncommon distances. On the UHF or VHF bands which are typically used for short range or line of sight communications, DX may represent communication with stations 50 or 100 miles away. The UHF and microwave bands have also been used to accomplish Earth–Moon–Earth communication between stations worldwide. On the low frequency bands (30 to 300 kHz), contacts between stations separated by more than 100 miles are often considered DX.\n\nAmong amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners, most traditional DX communication occurs on the HF bands, where the ionosphere is used to refract the transmitted radio beam. The beam returns to the Earth's surface, and may then be reflected back into the ionosphere for a second bounce. Ionospheric refraction is generally only feasible for frequencies below about 50 MHz, and is highly dependent upon atmospheric conditions, the time of day, and the eleven-year sunspot cycle. It is also affected by solar storms and some other solar events, which can alter the Earth's ionosphere by ejecting a shower of charged particles.\n\nThe angle of refraction places a minimum on the distance at which the refracted beam will first return to Earth. This distance increases with frequency. As a result, any station employing DX will be surrounded by an annular \"dead zone\" where they can't hear other stations or be heard by them.\n\nThis is the phenomenon that allows short wave radio reception to occur beyond the limits of line of sight. It is utilized by amateur radio enthusiasts (hams), shortwave broadcast stations (such as BBC and Voice of America) and others, and is what allows one to hear AM (MW) stations from areas far from their location. It is one of the backups to failure of long distance communication by satellites, when their operation is affected by electromagnetic storms from the sun.\n\nFor example, in clear ionosphere conditions, one can hear France Inter on 711 kHz, far into the UK and as far as Reading, Berkshire. It is also possible to hear Radio Australia from Melbourne as far away as Lansing, Michigan, a distance of some 9835 miles (15,827 kilometers).\n\nRadio equipment used in DXing ranges from inexpensive portable receivers to deluxe equipment costing thousands of dollars. Using just a simple AM radio, one can easily hear signals from the most powerful stations propagating hundreds of miles at night. Even inexpensive shortwave radio receivers can receive signals emanating from several countries during any time of day.\n\nSerious hobbyists use more elaborate receivers designed specifically for pulling in distant signals, and often build their own antennas designed for a specific frequency band. There is much discussion and debate in the hobby about the relative merits of lesser priced shortwave receivers vs. their multi-thousand dollar \"big brother\" radios. In general, a good desktop or \"PC Radio\" will be able to \"hear\" just about what a very expensive high-performance receiver can receive. The difference between the two types comes into play during difficult band or reception conditions. The expensive receiver will have more filtering options and usually better adjacent channel interference blocking, sometimes resulting in the difference of being able to receive or not receive a signal under poor conditions. Reception of international broadcasting seldom shows a noticeable difference between the two radios. Car radios are also used for DXing the broadcast bands.\n\nAnother recent trend is for the hobbyist to employ multiple radios and antennas connected to a personal computer. Through advanced radio control software, the radios can be automatically ganged together, so that tuning one radio can tune all the others in the group. This DXing technique is sometimes referred to as diversity reception and facilitates easy \"A to B\" comparison of different antennas and receivers for a given signal. For more details on \"PC Radios\" or computer controlled shortwave receivers see the discussion in Shortwave listening.\n\nHaving a minimum of two dipole antennas at right angles to each other (for example, one running north–south and one running east–west) can produce dramatically different reception patterns. These simple antennas can be made for a few dollars worth of wire and a couple of insulators.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 2004 and is based in Philadelphia and Brooklyn. Until 2014, the project operated as a band with drummer Sean Greenhalgh being a member for its entirety. Keyboardist/guitarist Robbie Guertin and brothers Lee (guitar/vocals) and Tyler (bass) Sargent were also a part of the band from its inception until their collective departure in 2012. Their debut album, \"Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\", was self-released in 2005.\n\nThe band, whose members met years earlier at Connecticut College, formed in the beginning of 2004 and played shows in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They are notable for achieving their initial fame and commercial success via the internet rather than through a record label. Shortly after the release of their first album, they received attention from numerous MP3 blogs and a favorable review from Pitchfork Media, who gave the band a \"Best New Music\" commendation. The ensuing demand for the album was so great that the band was forced to re-press the CD, as the initial production run was too small. They garnered even more press after David Bowie and David Byrne were spotted at some of the band's shows in 2005.\n\nIn October 2005, they were signed to Wichita Recordings in the UK. The band released their second album, \"Some Loud Thunder\", on January 29, 2007, in the UK, and January 30, 2007, in the United States. \n\nOn September 18, 2007, \"\" was released on iTunes. It features the band's complete live set from Lollapalooza, professionally recorded on August 4, 2007. The band appeared in the 2008 film \"The Great Buck Howard\". In 2008, Lee and Tyler Sargent performed on James Lavino's score to the Alex Karpovsky film \"Woodpecker\". The soundtrack also featured performances by Radiohead bass player Colin Greenwood.\nOn January 21, 2009, it was reported that CYHSY abandoned plans to head to the studio to record their third full-length album and are \"taking a break\" while the band members pursue side projects. The public hiatus was to take official effect after the band performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on February 13, 2009; however, on March 4, they performed a new song on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", titled \"Statues\".\n\nDuring the hiatus Alec Ounsworth released his solo debut, \"Mo Beauty\", in late 2009 while concurrently releasing \"Skin and Bones\", the debut album with his other band Flashy Python. Robbie Guertin and Tyler Sargent played in another project called Uninhabitable Mansions, along with Annie Hart from Au Revoir Simone. Guertin also began playing drums in another band, Radical Dads. Drummer Sean Greenhalgh produced records for a number of bands including Takka Takka, Conversion Party, Gabriel and the Hounds, Radical Dads, and Tom McBride.\nMay 2011 brought news of the third album, reassuring fans that they had not broken up. The band released \"Hysterical\", produced by John Congleton, on September 12 in the UK, Europe, Japan, and Australia, and on September 20 in the United States. It was announced via a post on the band's official website with a video of the band rehearsing a few new songs from the album in the studio. A vinyl reissue of a remastered edition of the first album, released on June 14, 2011, was also announced. A music video for \"Maniac\" was made by Belgian director Pieter Dirkx. It was released on September 14, 2011. Unlike their previous two albums, \"Hysterical\" was not as well received by Pitchfork, however it did still chart in the U.S., France, and U.K.\n\nOn July 3, 2012, an email from the group's website stated that Robbie Guertin was leaving to pursue other interests and to focus on his other band, Radical Dads. A subsequent email from the website dated July 6, 2012, stated that Tyler Sargent's last show with the band would be on July 7, 2012, as he was \"currently in the process of forming a presidential exploratory committee for 2016.\" Lee Sargent also left the band after the July 7 show.\n\nOn August 1, 2013, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah digitally released their EP \"Little Moments\" on their Bandcamp page. It consisted of four songs, two of which were to be included in a different form on their forthcoming LP, \"Only Run\". \"Little Moments\" featured a new sound for the band that included a heavier reliance on synths and drum machines and fewer guitars. The band recorded the EP in Alec Ounsworth's home studio, mixing and mastering the EP themselves. Additionally, 500 10 inch vinyl EPs were put on sale on the band's Bandcamp page.\n\nOn December 31, 2013, the band announced via email the completion of their forthcoming album called \"Only Run\" with a release date of June 3, 2014. The album was mixed by Dave Fridmann. A new single, \"Coming Down\", was released via SoundCloud on April 1, 2014. The track features vocals from The National's Matt Berninger. Following the release of \"Only Run\", Greenhalgh left the band, leaving Ounsworth as the only member of the band.\n\nOn May 13, 2015, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah announced they would be re-releasing their 2005 debut self-titled album on CD and vinyl for its 10th anniversary, which will coincide with a North American tour. The album was released on June 2, 2015, and came with a 12-track cassette of solo acoustic recordings.\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah released \"The Tourist\". This album has Ounsworth as the only remaining member from the original lineup.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2105018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105018", "title": "Disinhibition", "text": "Disinhibition\n\nIn psychology, disinhibition is a lack of restraint manifested in disregard of social conventions, impulsivity, and poor risk assessment. Disinhibition affects motor, instinctual, emotional, cognitive, and perceptual aspects with signs and symptoms similar to the diagnostic criteria for mania. Hypersexuality, hyperphagia, and aggressive outbursts are indicative of disinhibited instinctual drives.\n\nAccording to Grafman et al. \"disinhibition\" is a lack of restraint manifested in several ways, affecting motor, instinctual, emotional, cognitive, and perceptual aspects with signs and symptoms e.g. impulsivity, disregard for others and social norms, aggressive outbursts, misconduct and oppositional behaviors, disinhibited instinctual drives including risk taking behaviors and hypersexuality. Disinhibition is a common symptom following brain injury, or lesions, particularly to the frontal lobe and primarily to the orbitofrontal cortex. The neuropsychiatric sequelae following brain injuries could include diffuse cognitive impairment, with more prominent deficits in the rate of information processing, attention, memory, cognitive flexibility, and problem solving. Prominent impulsivity, affective instability, and disinhibition are seen frequently, secondary to injury to frontal, temporal, and limbic areas. In association with the typical cognitive deficits, these sequelae characterize the frequently noted \"personality changes\" in TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) patients. Disinhibition syndromes, in brain injuries and insults including brain tumors, strokes and epilepsy range from mildly inappropriate social behavior, lack of control over one's behaviour to the full-blown mania, depending on the lesions to specific brain regions. Several studies in brain traumas and insults have demonstrated significant associations between disinhibition syndromes and dysfunction of orbitofrontal and basotemporal cortices, affecting visuospatial functions, somatosensation, and spatial memory, motoric, instinctive, affective, and intellectual behaviors.\n\nDisinhibition syndromes have also been reported with mania-like manifestations in old age with lesions to the orbito-frontal and basotemporal cortex involving limbic and frontal connections (orbitofrontal circuit), especially in the right hemisphere. Behavioral disinhibition as a result of damage to frontal lobe could be seen as a result of consumption of alcohol and central nervous system depressants drugs, e.g. benzodiazepines that disinhibit the frontal cortex from self-regulation and control. It has also been argued that ADHD, hyperactive/impulsive subtype have a general behavioural disinhibition beyond impulsivity and many morbidities or complications of ADHD, e.g. conduct disorder, anti-social personality disorder. substance abuse and risk taking behaviours are all consequences of untreated behavioural disinhibition.\n\nIndividuals who show disinhibited behaviour tend to have this as part of a cluster of challenging behaviours including verbal aggression, physical aggression, socially inappropriate behaviour, sexual disinhibition, wandering, and repetitive behavior.\n\nDisinhibited behaviour occurs when people do not follow the social rules about what or where to say or do something. People who are disinhibited may come across as rude, tactless or even offensive. For example, a person with a brain injury may make a comment about how ugly another person is, or a person with dementia may have lost their social manners and look as though they are deliberately harassing another person.\n\nThe reasons why these behaviors may occur include: \n\nPositive Behaviour Support (PBS) is a treatment approach that looks at the best way to work with each individual with disabilities. A behavioural therapist conducts a functional analysis of behaviour which helps to determine ways to improve the quality of life for the person and does not just deal with problem behaviour.\n\nPBS also acknowledges the needs of support staff and includes strategies to manage crises when they arise. The following model is a brief guide to staff to remind them of key things to think about when planning support for a person with disabilities. There are two main objectives: reacting situationally when the behaviour occurs, and then acting proactively to prevent the behaviour from occurring.\n\nReactive strategies include:\n\nProactive strategies to prevent problems can include:\n\nBroadly speaking, when the behaviour occurs, assertively in a nonjudgemental, clear, unambiguous way provide feedback that the behaviour is inappropriate, and say what you prefer instead. For example, \"Jane, you're standing too close when you are speaking to me, I feel uncomfortable, please take a step back\", or \"I don't like it when you say I look hot in front of your wife, I feel uncomfortable, I am your Attendant Carer/Support Worker, I am here to help you with your shopping\". Then re-direct to the next activity. Any subsequent behaviour ignore. Then generally, as almost all behaviour is communication, understand what the behaviour is trying to communicate and look at ways to have the need met in more appropriate ways.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is known for its strawberry plantations earning the title \"Strawberry Fields of the Philippines\".\n\nThe valley encompassing La Trinidad was originally called \"Benguet\", a thriving community of Ibaloi migrants from Tinek. Natives traded local products, which included gold, with nearby lowland towns that had Dominican and Augustinian missions established. About 1616, the procurator general of Manila, Hemando de 1os Rios Coronel became interested in the mountain gold and proposed to the Spanish King to expedite its search. He wrote both Alonso Fajardo, the Governor of Manila, and the Archbishop of Manila in December 1618 that it was the solution to both the abandoned missions as well as the depleted colonial treasury. Fajardo requested feedback from the religious orders on this matter; whether waging a war against the Igorots was just. Only the Jesuits objected with the war, preferring only that their \"mines be occupied in the name of his Majesty\".\n\nIn 1620, Fajardo sent the first expedition under Captain Garcia Aldana y Cabrera, Governor of Pangasinan. Aldana and his men took the route from Aringay, crossing the Naguilian River to Duplas (La Union), then followed the Bornotan (Santo Rosario) River eventually reaching Takdian. Upon arriving at the mining community of Bua, the men found only a recently burned village, suggesting the natives fled with nothing for them to plunder. Aldana examined the Antamok mines and was able to gather some gold.\n\nA second expedition was sent in 1623 under the command of Sergeant Major Antonio Carreño de Valdes. Carreño was able to repel some Igorot assaults, building two forts; 'Fort Santiago' overlooking the present Santo Nino mines, and 'Fort del Rosario' in the Antamok-Itogon area. The Igorots submitted to Spanish authorities only to strike back when the rainy season made it difficult to send manpower and new supplies, prompting the Spaniards to retreat.\n\nFinally, in 1624, Fajardo sent Captain Alonso Martin Quirante, a master of strategy, logistics and tactics. In February of that year, Quirante took off with a huge expedition of 1,903 soldiers, carpenters, miners, smiths, slaves, clerks and some requisite clergy. He divided his large force into three; the first to clear the road, the second to follow, and the third with rations and arms. This ensured they would reach the mining area after clearing out an Igorot fort along the way. Quirante was able to reach the mining areas, and discovered about two hundred abandoned houses, implying the locals fled beforehand. He rebuilt Fort Santiago, and examined five mines; four of which showed signs of having been abandoned by the Igorots: Arisey Bugayona, Baranaban, Antamog, and Conog. The fifth mine called Galan was still operational. Quirante ordered baskets of ore gathered from each mine, labeled and ready for assaying. The results showed no evidence of deposits rich enough to yield attractive profit, prompting Quirante to return to Manila with 400 baskets of ore to be sent to Mexico for further assaying.\n\nMeanwhile, the Royal Audiencia had become concerned at the expense of the project which had already cost 33,982 pesos. Don Geronimo Silva took over the government, convening the council to decide on the issue. The Royal Audiencia decided to abandon the project because of mounting expenses, loss of life and the continued hostility of the Igorots and their land.\n\nIn 1829, another expedition was sent to Benguet under Guillermo Galvey.\n\nAlthough the District of Benguet was established in La Trinidad by 1846, it was only on April 21, 1874, under Commandant Manuel Scheidnagel, that \"\"Valle de Benguet\"\" was renamed \"\"Valle de La Trinidad\"\" (La Trinidad Valley). Despite popular acceptance that it was named as \"a fitting tribute to Galvey’s wife - Doña Trinidad de Galvey\" – recent research has revealed that credit should have probably gone to Scheidnagel, having been inspired by the three prominent adjacent hills (in effect, forming a Trinity: a religious icon of the Christian campaign) overlooking the \"Poblacion\" church, where the seat of government, the \"Cabecera\", was established.\n\nTogether with 40 other smaller surrounding \"rancherías\", La Trinidad was placed under the jurisdiction of the newly established Benguet \"commandancia politico-militar\" in 1846 and was established as its administrative headquarters during the Spanish Conquest of the Philippines.\n\nDuring the Philippine Revolution in July 1899, Filipino revolutionary forces under Pedro Paterno liberated La Trinidad from the Spaniards and took over the government, proclaiming Benguet as a province of the new Philippine Republic, with La Trinidad as its capital.\n\nIn 1900, the American colonizers arrived, and La Trinidad was established as one of the 19 townships under Benguet province, upon the issuance of \"Act No. 48\". For a brief period, Baguio became the capital of Benguet when appointed Benguet province civil governor \"H.P. Whitmarsh\" moved the seat of government from La Trinidad to Baguio in 1901. La Trinidad was made the provincial capital again in 1909, after the Baguio township was abolished and converted into a chartered city.\n\nOn May 3, 1945, The Filipino soldiers of the 2nd, 12th, 13th, 15th and 16th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 1st Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, and the 66th Infantry Regiment of the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines - Northern Luzon or USAFIP-NL liberated La Trinidad.\n\nLa Trinidad was transformed into a full-fledged town from its former status as municipal district by virtue of \"Republic Act No. 531\", approved June 16, 1950.\nOn June 23, 2016, La Trinidad was highlighted in the media when the first and largest community artwork in the Philippines, the \"STOBOSA Hillside Homes Artwork\" was unveiled, featuring hillside houses within the \"sitio\"s of Stonehill, Botiwtiw and Sadjap of Barangay Balili painted with sunflower and abstract designs.\n\nToday, people often hear about the town's push for cityhood. The town had long surpassed the requirements for annual income, but could not comply with either of the minimum population or land area requirements of at least 150,000 inhabitants or a contiguous territory of 100 square kilometers, as mandated by the Local Government Code.\n\nLa Trinidad is located at , at the central portion of Benguet. It is bounded by Tublay on the north-east, Sablan on the west, Baguio City on the south, Itogon on the southeast, and Tuba on the south-west.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Benguet.\n\nThe terrain is generally mountainous with springs, rivers and creeks. The town has a valley which encompasses several barangays. The valley floor elevation is at above sea level. Elevation ranges from above sea level.\n\nBalili River is the municipality's main water drainage which carries upstream water from Sagudin River in Baguio City. The river merges with another upstream river in Tuel upon reaching the La Trinidad-Tublay-Sablan tri-point.\n\nLa Trinidad has a dry-winter subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cwb), featuring a menacing wet season.\n\nLa Trinidad belongs under the Type I climate by the Coronas System of classification with distinct wet and dry seasons. The dry season is from November to April while the wet season occurs during the rest of the year. The climate is cool with temperatures ranging from during the month of December at its coldest and at its warmest during the months of March, April and May. The average daily temperature is .

The first party, called \"Love Saves The Day\", was in 1970.\n\nMancuso pioneered the private party, as distinct from the more commercial nightclub business model. In the early 1970s, Mancuso won a long administrative trial when the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found that he was not selling food or beverages to the public and therefore did not need a NYC cabaret license.\n\nMancuso's success at keeping his parties \"underground\" and legal inspired others, and many famous private discothèques of the 1970s and 1980s were modeled after The Loft, including the Paradise Garage, The Gallery, 12 West, The Flamingo and later The Saint. Mancuso also helped start the record pool system for facilitating the distribution of promotional records to the qualified disc jockey. Elements of Mancuso's influence can also be seen in the famous nightly scene outside of New York City's Studio 54, where legendary owner Steve Rubell and 20th Century Fox vice President Billy Smith a.k.a Billy Amato understood the appeal of selectivity and took Mancuso's \"invitation only\" idea and expanded it to ridiculous, and ridiculously effective, extremes.\n\nMancuso was born on October 20, 1944 in Utica, New York. He was born out of wedlock while his mother's husband was serving in World War II and lived in an orphanage for the first five years of his life. Although he nominally resided with his mother thereafter, he remained a frequent runaway and spent a year in reform school as a teenager; during this period, he cultivated an interest in early rhythm and blues music.\n\nHe dropped out of high school on his 16th birthday and worked as a dishwasher for two years, to finance his move to New York City in 1962. Over the next several years, he was employed in a variety of capacities (including stints as head of Holt Rinehart Winston's Xerox department and as a personnel manager for Restaurant Associates) before pursuing a career as a freelance purveyor of antiques.\n\nAfter being introduced to high fidelity sound components (including the Klipschorn speaker) by a friend who resided in Brooklyn Heights, Mancuso purchased some equipment from fellow hobbyist Richard Long, who soon became a close friend; following his initial work with Mancuso, Long would go on to design many of the most important sound systems in the New York underground disco scene.\n\nMancuso continued to develop a highly variegated social network (a characteristic that he ascribed to his unconventional upbringing), frequenting rent parties in such disparate milieus as Harlem and Staten Island, while also immersing himself in the hippie culture of the era at such East Village venues as the Electric Circus, the Planetarium, and the Fillmore East (where he was present for notable performances by Timothy Leary and Nina Simone). He became an ardent devotee of Leary's \"The Psychedelic Experience\" (1966) after his initial experiments with LSD.\n\nBefore hosting his first Loft party at his home at 647 Broadway in 1970, Mancuso was playing records for his friends on a semi-regular basis as early as 1966. These parties became so popular that by 1971, he and Steve Abramowitz, who worked the door, decided to do this on a weekly basis. These parties were similar to rent parties or house parties.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Mancuso and Colleen 'Cosmo' Murphy produced the compilation series \"David Mancuso Presents The Loft\", Volumes One and Two on Nuphonic.\n\nIn 2003, British journalist and lecturer Tim Lawrence published an influential and comprehensive study of the New York roots of modern dance music culture that placed Mancuso at its narrative center. Entitled \"Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970–1979\", the book highlights the influence of Mancuso's late 1960s and early 1970s Loft parties on every major figure in the New York dance music scene, including Robert Williams, the founder of Chicago's Warehouse and Muzic Box; Nicky Siano, the founder of the Gallery; Larry Levan, the DJ at the Paradise Garage; Tony Humphries, the founder of Zanzibar; among numerous others. \n\nMancuso's first major Loft party, called \"Love Saves The Day\", was held Saturday, February 14, 1970, at his home, at 647 Broadway. The importance of Mancuso and The Loft are also chronicled in Josell Ramos' documentary, \"Maestro\" (2003), a Paradise Garage and Levan-centered narrative of New York dance music culture in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, Mancuso was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for his outstanding achievement as a DJ.\n\nOn December 23, 2006, a nightclub named after Mancuso opened in Tübingen, in southern Germany.\n\nIn May 2008, Mancuso, with the help of Goshi Manabe, Colleen Murphy, and Satoru Ogawa, launched his own audiophile record label, The Loft Audiophile Library of Music. The music is mastered by Stan Ricker.\n\nMancuso died at his home in Manhattan on November 14, 2016.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2105051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105051", "title": "Draw distance", "text": "Draw distance\n\nIn computer graphics, draw distance (render distance or view distance) is the maximum distance of objects in a three-dimensional scene that are drawn by the rendering engine. Polygons that lie beyond the draw distance will not be drawn to the screen.\n\nDraw distance requires definition because a processor having to render objects out to an infinite distance would slow down the application to an unacceptable speed. As the draw distance increases, more distant polygons need to be drawn onto the screen that would regularly be clipped. This requires more computing power; the graphic quality and realism of the scene will increase as draw distance increases, but the overall performance (frames per second) will decrease. Many games and applications will allow users to manually set the draw distance to balance performance and visuals.\n\nOlder games had far shorter draw distances, most noticeable in vast, open scenes. In many cases, once-distant objects or terrain would suddenly appear without warning as the camera got closer to them, an effect known as \"pop-up graphics\", \"pop-in\", or \"draw in\". This is a hallmark of short draw distance, and still plagues large, open-ended games like the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series and \"Second Life\". In newer games, this effect is usually limited to smaller objects such as people or trees, a contrast to older games where huge chunks of terrain could suddenly appear or fade in along with smaller objects. The Sony PlayStation game \"Formula 1 97\" offered a setting so the player could choose between fixed draw distance (with variable frame rate) and fixed frame rate (with variable draw distance).\n\nA common trick used in games to disguise a short draw distance is to obscure the area with a distance fog. Alternative methods have been developed to sidestep the problem altogether using level of detail manipulation. \"Black & White\" was one of the earlier games to use adaptive level of detail to decrease the number of polygons in objects as they moved away from the camera, allowing it to have a massive draw distance while maintaining detail in close-up views.\n\n\"\" uses a variant of the level of detail programming. The game overworld is divided into 49 squares. Each square has an island inside of it; the distances between the island and the borders of the square are considerable. Everything within a square is loaded when entered, including all models used in close-up views and animations. Utilizing the telescope item, one can see just how detailed even far-away areas are. However, textures are not displayed; they are faded in as one gets closer to the square's island. Islands outside of the current square are less detailed—however, these far-away island models do not degenerate any further than that, even though some of these islands can be seen from everywhere else in the overworld. In both indoor and outdoor areas, there is no distance fog; however, there are some areas where \"distance\" fog is used as an atmospheric effect. As a consequence to the developers' attention to detail, however, some areas of the game have lower frame rates due to the large number of enemies on screen.\n\n\"Halo 3\" is claimed by its creators at Bungie to have a draw distance upwards of 14 miles, which is an example of the vastly improved draw distances made possible by more recent game consoles. In addition, \"Crysis\" is said to have a draw distance up to , while \"\", has a potentially unlimited draw distance, possibly due to the larger map size. \"Grand Theft Auto V\" was praised for its seemingly infinite draw distance despite having a large, detailed map.\n\n"}

{"id": "2105059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105059", "title": "Two-photon excitation microscopy", "text": "Two-photon excitation microscopy\n\nTwo-photon excitation microscopy (TPEF or 2PEF) is a fluorescence imaging technique that allows imaging of living tissue up to about one millimeter in thickness. Unlike traditional fluorescence microscopy, in which the excitation wavelength is shorter than the emission wavelength, two-photon excitation requires simultaneous excitation by two photons with longer wavelength than the emitted light. Two-photon excitation microscopy typically uses near-infrared (NIR) excitation light which can also excite fluorescent dyes. However, for each excitation, two photons of NIR light are absorbed. Using infrared light minimizes scattering in the tissue. Due to the multiphoton absorption, the background signal is strongly suppressed. Both effects lead to an increased penetration depth for this technique. Two-photon excitation can be a superior alternative to confocal microscopy due to its deeper tissue penetration, efficient light detection, and reduced photobleaching.\nTwo-photon excitation employs two-photon absorption, a concept first described by Maria Goeppert Mayer (1906–1972) in her doctoral dissertation in 1931, and first observed in 1961 in a CaF:Eu crystal using laser excitation by Wolfgang Kaiser. Isaac Abella showed in 1962 in caesium vapor that two-photon excitation of single atoms is possible.\n\nTwo-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy has similarities to other confocal laser microscopy techniques such as laser scanning confocal microscopy and Raman microscopy. These techniques use focused laser beams scanned in a raster pattern to generate images, and both have an optical sectioning effect. Unlike confocal microscopes, multiphoton microscopes do not contain pinhole apertures that give confocal microscopes their optical sectioning quality. The optical sectioning produced by multiphoton microscopes is a result of the point spread function of the excitation: the multiphoton point spread function is typically dumbbell-shaped (longer in the x-y plane), compared to the upright rugby-ball shaped point spread function of confocal microscopes. The concept of two-photon excitation is based on the idea that two photons, of comparably lower photon energy than needed for one photon excitation, can also excite a fluorophore in one quantum event. Each photon carries approximately half the energy necessary to excite the molecule. Excitation results in the subsequent emission of a fluorescence photon with the same quantum yield that would result from conventional single-photon absorption. The emitted photon is typically at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than either of the two exciting photons. The probability of the near-simultaneous absorption of two photons is extremely low. Therefore, a high peak flux of excitation photons is typically required, usually generated by femtosecond pulsed laser. The purpose of employing the two-photon effect is that the axial spread of the point spread function is substantially lower than for single-photon excitation. As a result, the extent along the z dimension is improved, allowing for thin optical sections to be cut. In addition, in many interesting cases the shape of the spot and its size can be designed to realize specific desired goals. The longer wavelength, lower energy (typically infrared) excitation lasers of multiphoton microscopes are well-suited to use in imaging live cells as they cause less damage than the short-wavelength lasers typically used for single-photon excitation, so cells may be observed for longer periods with fewer toxic effects.\n\nThe most commonly used fluorophores have excitation spectra in the 400–500 nm range, whereas the laser used to excite the two-photon fluorescence lies in the ~700–1000 nm (infrared) range produced by Ti-sapphire lasers. If the fluorophore absorbs two infrared photons simultaneously, it will absorb enough energy to be raised into the excited state. The fluorophore will then emit a single photon with a wavelength that depends on the type of fluorophore used (typically in the visible spectrum). Because two photons are absorbed during the excitation of the fluorophore, the probability for fluorescent emission from the fluorophores increases quadratically with the excitation intensity. Therefore, much more two-photon fluorescence is generated where the laser beam is tightly focused than where it is more diffuse. Effectively, excitation is restricted to the tiny focal volume (~1 femtoliter), resulting in a high degree of rejection of out-of-focus objects. This \"localization of excitation\" is the key advantage compared to single-photon excitation microscopes, which need to employ elements such as pinholes to reject out-of-focus fluorescence. The fluorescence from the sample is then collected by a high-sensitivity detector, such as a photomultiplier tube. This observed light intensity becomes one pixel in the eventual image; the focal point is scanned throughout a desired region of the sample to form all the pixels of the image.\n\nTwo-photon microscopy was pioneered and patented by Winfried Denk and James Strickler in the lab of Watt W. Webb at Cornell University in 1990. They combined the idea of two-photon absorption with the use of a laser scanner. In two-photon excitation microscopy an infrared laser beam is focused through an objective lens. The Ti-sapphire laser normally used has a pulse width of approximately 100 femtoseconds (fs) and a repetition rate of about 80 MHz, allowing the high photon density and flux required for two photons absorption and is tunable across a wide range of wavelengths. Mode-locked Yb-doped fiber lasers with 325 fs pulses have also been employed for collagen imaging, demonstrating a penetration depth of beyond 320 μm in collagen, which is considerably superior to depths of 250 to 300 μm achievable when coupled to a conventional Ti-sapphire excitation laser.\n\nThe use of infrared light to excite fluorophores in light-scattering tissue has added benefits. Longer wavelengths are scattered to a lesser degree than shorter ones, which is a benefit to high-resolution imaging. In addition, these lower-energy photons are less likely to cause damage outside the focal volume. Compared to a confocal microscope, photon detection is much more effective since even scattered photons contribute to the usable signal. These benefits for imaging in scattering tissues were only recognized several years after the invention of two-photon excitation microscopy.\n\nThere are several caveats to using two-photon microscopy: The pulsed lasers needed for two-photon excitation are much more expensive than the continuous wave (CW) lasers used in confocal microscopy. The two-photon absorption spectrum of a molecule may vary significantly from its one-photon counterpart. For very thin objects such as isolated cells, single-photon (confocal) microscopes can produce images with higher optical resolution due to their shorter excitation wavelengths. In scattering tissue, on the other hand, the superior optical sectioning and light detection capabilities of the two-photon microscope result in better performance.\n\nTwo-photon microscopy has been involved with numerous fields including: physiology, neurobiology, embryology and tissue engineering. Even thin, nearly transparent tissues (such as skin cells) have been visualized with clear detail due to this technique. Two-photon microscopy's high speed imaging capabilities may also be utilized in noninvasive optical biopsy. In cell biology, two-photon microscopy has been aptly used for producing localized chemical reactions. Using two-photon fluorescence and second-harmonic generation–based microscopy, it was shown that organic porphyrin-type molecules can have different transition dipole moments for two-photon fluorescence and second harmonic generation, which are otherwise thought to occur from the same transition dipole moment. Non-degenerative two-photon excitation, or using 2 photons of unequal wavelengths, was shown to increase the fluorescence of all tested small molecules and fluorescent proteins.\n\n2PEF was also proven to be very valuable for characterizing skin cancer.\nIt had also been shown to reveal tumor cell arrest, tumor cell-platelet interaction, tumor cell-leukocyte interaction and metastatic colonization processes.\n\n2PEF and 3PEF are used to characterize intact neural tissues.\n\nMultiphoton fluorescence (2PEF and 3PEF) is a useful mean of imaging the brain in-vivo.\n\nSimultaneous absorption of three or more photons is also possible, allowing for higher multiphoton excitation microscopy. The so-called \"three photons excited fluorecence microscopy\" (3PEF) is the most used technique after 2PEF, to which it is complementary.\nIn general, all commonly used fluorescent proteins (CFP, GFP, YFP, RFP) and dyes can be excited in two-photon mode. Two-photon excitation spectra are often considerably broader, making it more difficult to excite fluorophores selectively by switching excitation wavelengths. A useful resource is the on-line database of two-photon spectra from Cornell University.\n\nSeveral green, red and NIR emitting dyes (probes and reactive labels) with extremely high 2-photon absorption cross-sections have been reported. Due to the donor-acceptor-donor type structure, squaraine dyes such as \"Seta-670\", \"Seta-700\" and \"Seta-660\" exhibit very high 2-photon absorption (2PA) efficiencies in comparison to other dyes, \"SeTau-647\" and \"SeTau-665\", a new type of squaraine-rotaxane, exhibit extremely high two-photon action cross-sections of up to 10,000 GM in the near IR region, unsurpassed by any other class of organic dyes.\n\n\n\n"}

U.S. and Interstate highways are classified as state routes in Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania established the Location Referencing System (LRS) in 1987, which registers all numbered routes in Pennsylvania as SR-X. A state route would be SR 39, a US Route would be SR 22, and an Interstate route would be SR 80. However, routes which are numbered between 0000 and 0999 are classified as Traffic Routes, which are abbreviated as PA 39, US 22, and I-80, instead. There are also four-digit numbers for various \"state roads\" over which PennDOT has jurisdiction, but those numbers are not displayed on the roads, except in rural areas, where they are posted with index-card-sized small signs. In urban areas, these numbers are somewhat less prominently posted, and these streets are known by the names on the street signs.\n\nIn 1911, when the Sproul Road Bill was passed, a large number of \"Legislative Routes\" (\"LR\") were assigned. These were the primary internal numbering until the present Location Referencing System was adopted in 1987. See also List of legislative routes in Pennsylvania.\n\nSigned Traffic Route numbers from 1 to 12 were first assigned in 1924 to several of the national auto trails:\n\n\"Italics\" denote former routes.\n\n\nSoon more numbers were assigned, including three-digit numbers for branches, like Pennsylvania Route 272 from Pennsylvania Route 72. The United States Numbered Highways were assigned in late 1926, and in 1928 State Routes concurrent with U.S. Routes were removed, while those that conflicted with U.S. Routes were assigned new numbers. In 1946, a mass decommissioning of highways around the state occurred, and many state routes were decommissioned, truncated, or rerouted. The establishment of the Interstate Highway System in 1959, as well as wanting to eliminate some concurrences in Pittsburgh, resulted in a small renumbering in 1961.\nSince Pennsylvania first introduced numbered traffic routes in 1924, a keystone shape has been used, in reference to Pennsylvania being the \"Keystone State\". The signs originally said \"Penna\" (a common abbreviation for Pennsylvania at the time), followed by the route number in block-style numbering in a keystone cutout. In the mid 1950s, the signs were modified to have \"PA\" instead of \"Penna\", with the lone exception being the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike (which continues to use \"Penna\" today for both the mainline, the Northeast Extension, and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission logo); additionally, the numbers were made more round and the signs were made larger in order to be more legible while driving, and the keystone shape itself remained a cutout. By the late 1960s, as U.S. Routes were beginning to be made on rectangular cutouts with the U.S.-style shield painted onto them instead of the shield cutout in most states outside of California, the same was done with the keystone. The state initials were removed altogether and while the numbers remained rounded, were standardized into FHWA Series E typeface, which was becoming the standard for the Interstate Highway System. Most of the 1950s vintage signs were replaced with the newer rectangular cutout with the painted-on keystone by the early 1970s, though a very few remain in scattered places on non-decommissioned roads. Pennsylvania has used the painted-on keystone signs since.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is noted for making the films \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\" in 1940 and \"Jedda\" in 1955.\n\nCharles Edward Chauvel was born on 7 October 1897 in Warwick, Queensland, the son of James Allan Chauvel and his wife Susan Isabella (née Barnes), pioneer farmers in the Mutdapilly area. He was the nephew of General Sir Harry Chauvel, Commander of the Australian Light Horse and later the Desert Mounted Corps in Palestine during World War I. His father, a grazier, at 53 also enlisted to serve in Palestine and Sinai in World War I. The Chauvels were descended from a French Huguenot family who fled France for England in 1685, and soon established a tradition of serving in the British army. The Australian Chauvels descended from a Charles Chauvel who retired from the Indian Army to New South Wales in 1839 and was a pioneer in the New England region.\n\nChauvel was educated at the Normanby State School (now the Mutdapilly State School), The Southport School and Ipswich Grammar School in Queensland.\n\nAfter leaving school, he worked on Queensland properties, and on his family property when his father was at war, before studying commercial art and taking drama classes in Sydney. He was fascinated by films and pestered a friend, showman Reginald \"Snowy\" Baker, to give him work as a production assistant; usually, he was the man in charge of the horses. Chauvel worked on \"The Shadow of Lightning Ridge\" (1920) and \"The Jackeroo of Coolabong\" (1920) with Baker; he also assisted on \"Robbery Under Arms\" (1920)\n\nHe designed the St Aidan's Church of England in Mutdapilly in 1921 (the church closed in 1974 and is now used as a private residence). \nChauvel followed Baker to Hollywood in 1922, at his own expense, and spent some time as a jack of all trades including working as an extra, a lighting technician, a publicist, a stunt double and so on. The films he worked on included \"Strangers of the Night\" (1923).\n\nBack in Australia after about a year, Chauvel obtained finance from Queensland businessmen and friends to make his first film \"The Moth of Moonbi\". It was a romantic melodramas exploring a theme of the decadent city vs the authentic country. \"The Moth of Moonbi\" is a country girl who flutters to the city lights, loses her fortune, but eventually returns home and finds love with her father's trusty stockman.\n\nThe film was profitable enough for Chauvel to raise funds for a second film.\nIn \"Greenhide\" a city girl struggles to cope on a cattle station and gradually finds love with her polar opposite, an extremely taciturn bushman. Like \"Moonbi\" the film was made in Harrisville near Brisbane, enlisting the locals as extras and using locations around his family property \"Summerlands\", near the edge of town. While making \"Greenhide\" he met Elsa May Wilcox (professional name Elsa Sylvaney), an actress, whom he married on 1927. After their marriage she traveled with him and assisted him on all his films.\n\nBoth these silent films were released in 1926 and were reasonably successful in Australia. Unfortunately Chauvel could not arrange for the release of his silent movies in Hollywood because of the transition to sound.\n\nChauvel returned to Australia and worked as a cinema manager during the Depression.\n\nIn 1933 he made his first talkie: \"In the Wake of the Bounty\" starring Errol Flynn as Fletcher Christian before Flynn went on to Hollywood. The film mixed re-enactments with documentary, and focused not so much on the mutiny itself as on its consequences. To provide a long postscript to the story of the mutiny, the Chauvels went to Pitcairn Island and shot interesting footage of the descendants, spending three months on the island. He also included footage of bare-breasted Tahitian dancers which caused a temporary problem with the censors. The documentary parts were later edited out and used as promotional material for the 1935 Hollywood film about the mutiny.\nIn 1935, Chauvel won a Commonwealth Government competition for \"Heritage\" which gave a panoramic view of Australian history. It begins with a character from the earliest days of white settlement (1788), following his struggles, his loves and his marriage, then skips to the modern generation, where a romance between descendants of the original characters completes a circle. The modern hero is struggling to run an outback cattle station, the modern heroine is an expert aviator.\nIn 1936 he made \"Uncivilised,\" a \"jungle story\" filmed in Cape York, in Far North Queensland, Australia. Aimed at the U.S. market, it is the story of an upper class \"girl-reporter\" investigating the white leader of an Aboriginal tribe.\n\nThat year also saw the release of \"Rangle River\" (1936), based on a script by Charles and Elsa Chauvel.\n\nThe outbreak of war meant that Chauvel turned to war-themed films, making \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\" (1940), a tribute to the Australian Light Horse Brigade in Palestine in World War I, in the Cronulla sand dunes. It was both a popular and critical success and was credited with boosting morale. It also launched the career of actor Chips Rafferty.\n\nChauvel then focused on making a series of propaganda shorts for the Australian war effort including \"Soldiers Without Uniform\" (1942).\nChauvel attempt to repeat his \"Horseman\" success with \"The Rats of Tobruk\" in 1944. It was not as successful.\n\nAfter the war he made a film about a pioneer family in Queensland, \"Sons of Matthew\" (1949), drawing on his own family history\nIn 1955 Chauvel made perhaps his best known film, \"Jedda\". Jedda is a story of an Aboriginal baby girl raised by a white station owner and kept in ignorance of traditional ways, and the Aboriginal man who carries her off, even though this is a forbidden \"wrong way\" marriage, and brings tragedy to both of them.\n\nBoth \"Jedda\" and \"Matthew\" involved travel to remote areas and difficult conditions for filming, and are considered Chauvel's best works. Jedda was the first Australian feature film made in colour, and had to be developed overseas as there were no colour processing facilities in Australia. For \"Jedda\", the Chauvels sought out Aboriginal people for the lead roles, and in Robert Tudawali, playing the male lead, they found someone with great natural ability. Both these films were made in a period when the Australian film industry had virtually collapsed, unable to compete with imported films.\n\nAfter this, Chauvel turned to television, making the BBC series \"Walkabout\" which travelled to interesting locations in Australia. He died unexpectedly of coronary vascular disease on 11 November 1959, less than a month after Errol Flynn, whom he cast in \"In the Wake of the Bounty.\" According to Ken G. Hall, Chauvel had left a message asking to speak to Hall on the day he died, and left an estate worth £32,000.\n\nSince 1992 the Brisbane International Film Festival has awarded a Chauvel Award to a \"distinguished contributor to Australian Cinema\".\n\nChauvel Cinema, an art-house cinema in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, is named after him.\n\nChauvel was posthumously inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Charles Chauvel was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as an \"Influential Artists\".\n\nChauvel announced a number of projects over the years that were not made, including:\n\n\n"}

The group was originally formed to perform Louis Andriessen's minimal composition \"Hoketus\", but remained together and began to perform music composed for the group by other composers (many of whom came from within the group's ranks). The group disbanded in 1987.\n\nThe ensemble's instrumentation and overall artistic aesthetic was quite radical; it was made up of two equal groups of instruments (two pianos, two Fender Rhodes electric pianos, two sets of panpipes, two saxophones, two electric bass guitars, and two percussionists).\n\nHoketus considered itself a collective and set a number of rules for itself, rules so stringent that taken together they could be considered a manifesto. The group always performed with amplification set at a high volume, the two groups of instruments situating themselves as far apart as possible from one another on stage. Personal expression was not permitted; melodies could only be built through the interlocking of single notes or chords, played in alternation between the groups using the Medieval technique of hocket (hence the group's name). The group had an aesthetic bias toward works that were heavy, loud, dissonant, and brutal, showing influence from both hard rock and the works of Igor Stravinsky (one of Andriessen's favorite composers).\n\nBesides Andriessen, other composers who wrote for Hoketus include Diderik Wagenaar, Cornelis de Bondt, Michael Nyman, Huib Emmer, Klas Torstensson, and Gene Carl.\n\nAn ensemble of similar instrumentation called Icebreaker was formed in York, England in 1989, and continues to perform works from the Hoketus repertoire.\n"}

{"id": "2105152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105152", "title": "Rachel Crothers", "text": "Rachel Crothers\n\nRachel Crothers (December 12, 1878 – July 5, 1958) was an American playwright and theater director known for her well-crafted plays that often dealt with feminist themes. Among theater historians, she is generally recognized as \"the most successful and prolific woman dramatist writing in the first part of the twentieth century.\" One of her most famous plays was \"Susan and God\" (1937), which was made into a film by MGM in 1940 starring Joan Crawford and Fredric March.\n\nCrothers was born on December 12, 1878 in Bloomington, Illinois, to Dr. Eli Kirk Crothers and Dr. Marie Louise (de Pew) Crothers. Crothers' mother, an independent-minded woman whose father had been friends with Abraham Lincoln, went to medical school at forty and became one of the first woman physicians in Illinois, encountering and eventually overcoming much opposition to her practice in Bloomington. Though her parents were religious and conservative, with no particular interest in theater, issues of money, equality, risk-taking, and a woman's place in the world were a part of Crothers' life from her earliest years.\n\nThe family intended that their daughters should be educated, and Crothers graduated from Illinois State University High School in 1891, at the precocious age of thirteen. The following year, she attended the New England School of Dramatic Instruction in Boston, where her passion for the stage was nurtured. Her hopes of moving to New York to seek a career in theater were opposed by her parents, who insisted she return home to Illinois. Her interest in acting continued even there, however, and she was a founding member of the Bloomington Dramatic Club. (Her taste in plays was rather advanced for the time: Ibsen's still-scandalous \"A Doll's House\" was one of her suggestions for a Club production.) By the age of nineteen, five years after her father's death, Crothers was allowed to realize her dream and move on her own to New York. \"I knew no one in New York,\" she later recalled, \"but I had heard of David Belasco and Daniel Frohman, and they were kind enough to answer my letters.\" That was encouragement enough and, though the famous producers' help ended there, she left Bloomington for Manhattan (with the financial backing of her mother), enrolled in acting classes, and found small parts in stock and touring companies.\n\nBy 1899, Crothers was writing her own one-act plays, and over the next few years, as these plays received showcase productions and good notices, she gained a reputation as a young dramatist of serious potential with an interest in the Ibsen-style \"social problem drama.\" Her big break came in 1906, at the age of twenty-eight, when her first full-length play, \"The Three of Us,\" was produced and enjoyed a 277-performance run at the Madison Square Theatre in New York City. The play received its London premiere at Terry's Theatre on June 10, 1908, with Fannie Ward playing the leading role.\n\nFrom that time on, through the 1940s, Crothers was a major name in the Broadway theater world. Her commercial record was erratic—hits and flops, equally mixed—but she was a productive and respected writer with a considerable body of work to her name by the time she was middle-aged.\n\nShe died on July 5, 1958 in Danbury, Connecticut.\n\nRachel Crothers' plays often dealt with contemporary social themes and moral problems affecting women, including the sexual double standard, trial marriage, \"free love,\" divorce, prostitution, and Freudian psychology. Though some of her plays are clear, provocative expressions of sympathy for the challenges twentieth-century women had to confront and present young female characters of boldness and originality, others involve an element of comedy, even parody, and an implied criticism of radical feminism; thus, her work cannot be easily characterized in a political sense. In some plays, her free-spirited young women revert to traditional roles at the end, especially when they are in danger of losing a man they love, and in other plays \"Crothers records a sense of disillusionment with the women's movement and a tendency to blame it for deficiencies in women's emotional life.\" But Crothers wrote in period of rapid social change, as she well knew. \"If you want to see the sign of the times, watch women,\" she commented in 1912. \"Their evolution is the most important thing in modern life.\"\n\nWhen \"The Three of Us\" was written, the Nineteenth Amendment was fourteen years in the future and relatively few women questioned marital inequities; by the time she ceased writing plays in the late 1930s, the world, at least for middle-class women in the United States, had been altered in profound ways. Crothers' over thirty one-act and full-length plays reflect those changes, more subtly than she has sometimes been given credit for.\n\n\"He and She\" (1920), for example, illustrates Crothers' nuanced sense of the gender problems modern Americans were confronting in this period of change. Set in 1910, at about the time she originally drafted the play, \"He and She\" takes as its protagonists an appealing married couple, Tom and Ann Herford. They are a cosmopolitan pair with careers, a child, and a happy marriage. Tom supports women's rights and is pleased that his wife has demonstrated talent in his own field, sculpture. But when he loses an important sculptural commission to Ann, the family's beliefs are put to the test: Can Tom live with his wife's public success and his own very visible failure? Can Ann live with Tom's embarrassment and the effect it may have on their relationship? Will Ann's professional commitments now take her even further from her maternal duties to a teenaged daughter who is already feeling neglected because of her parents' busy work lives? Other characters include Tom's assistant, who is honest about expecting his fiancée to give up her career as a journalist and become a homemaker when they marry (not an agreeable prospect to the young woman); Ann's father, who is dismayed that his daughter would even consider jeopardizing her marriage in this way; and Tom's unmarried sister, who is self-supporting but has achieved this status by not having a husband and children, a loss she regrets.\n\nThe play ends with Ann arguing that the decision to have children, for a woman, changes everything; motherhood must take precedence over a career. Yet \"He and She\" manages not to feel like a reactionary or anti-feminist tract. The inherent unfairness of the dilemma the Herfords confront has been well-established, leaving audiences food for thought. Ann's capacities and largeness of spirit have been ably displayed (she is one of the great female characters in American drama circa 1920). Most importantly, Crothers has situated her story in a real world of good intentions and hard facts: true equality is still a pretense, even among liberal men and women, and someone has to take care of the children. The values of the older generation for whom there is nothing to debate (represented by Ann's father) and the values of the New Woman (represented by the fiancée of Tom's assistant who has no intention of giving up her job when she marries) are also effectively noted. \"He and She\" was performed on Broadway in 1920 to critical approval (though not a strong box-office run) and was revived in New York, in a well-received production, in 1980 and again in 2005.\n\nCrothers worked in a context that was both timely and, in some ways, strikingly against the grain. In the years immediately before World War I, for instance, Broadway saw a vogue for plays about white slavery, sexually-transmitted disease, and brothels. Most of the writers were male, of course, and a borderline-legal but titillating Act I brothel or abduction scene was part of the pattern of these usually formulaic plays. Crothers' approach in \"Ourselves\" (1913) was different. She began work on the play in 1912 before the vogue was underway, visited the Bedford Street Reformatory for Women to talk to some imprisoned sex workers, and elected to adopt an entirely female-centered perspective. In what one theater historian has called \"the best of all the white slave plays\" of the era, \"Ourselves\" tells the story of a woman attempting to make a new life after being released from jail but confronted on all sides by people who want her to fall back into her old ways, don't believe that such a goal is possible for a \"fallen woman,\" or profess a good-will that they cannot bring themselves to act on. Like George Bernard Shaw's \"Mrs. Warren's Profession,\" there is no brothel in the play to entertain a voyeuristic audience; there is a clear suggestion that male sexual appetites are the problem, not women's weakness or immorality; and the author expresses some skepticism about reformist intentions in a society wedded to its hypocrisy. Crothers goes further, though: one character (clearly echoing the writer's view) explicitly suggests that the men should be judged as harshly and readily by society as the offending women, while Crothers acknowledges that women's sexual urges are not entirely irrelevant to the predicament she is dramatizing. Reviews for the play were mixed, with many reviewers complaining that Crothers had written too few male parts (only four out of twenty-one characters are men) and focused too exclusively on \"the feminine point of view.\"\n\nOther plays by Crothers that deal with female identity and societal pressures to conform include her first, \"The Three of Us\" (1906), in which the female protagonist, a Nevada mine owner, protests the idea that a woman's \"honor\" is something men should feel obliged to protect; \"A Man's World\" (1910), the story of a woman writer who publishes under a man's name in the hope of greater acceptance; and \"Young Wisdom\" (1914), a satire of the New Woman and the idea of trial marriages. \n\"Nice People\" (1921) and \"Mary the Third\" (1923) include comic portrayals of flappers (Tallulah Bankhead played one of the flappers in \"Nice People\"), while \"As Husbands Go\" (1931) and \"When Ladies Meet\" (1933) explore Depression-era attitudes toward women's advancement since suffrage.\n\nCrothers' last professionally produced play, \"Susan and God\" (1937), was her greatest commercial success. The play tells the story of a wealthy, spoiled, and restless woman who finds meaning for her aimless life in an evangelical movement and attempts to convert her Park Avenue friends. She plans to leave her alcoholic husband and daughter to assume a public role as an evangelist, for which she is ludicrously ill-equipped. In the end, Susan accepts that she has been deluded by her conversion, that faith and salvation are far more complex than she had acknowledged, and that a more loving and meaningful act would be to help her husband achieve a stable life. Crothers biographer Lois Gottlieb finds the portrayal of the title character \"satirical yet ultimately sympathetic.\"\n\nCrothers was part of an \"old girls' network\" of theater professionals that took shape in the 1920s. Asked by Djuna Barnes in a 1931 interview about how she had been able to make a successful career in a male-dominated field, Crothers answered: \"For a woman, it is best to look to women for help; women are more daring, they are glad to take the most extraordinary chances...I think I should have been longer about my destiny if I had to battle with men alone.\" Actresses were especially appreciative of the strong roles she created for them, and leading parts in her plays were performed by Ethel Barrymore, Estelle Winwood, Katharine Cornell, Tallulah Bankhead, and Gertrude Lawrence, among others.\n\nCrothers broke new ground by directing, staging, and casting most of her own plays. She also directed several plays written by others. Though little-known today, Crothers was regarded as the most successful woman to write for the stage in the decades before the rise of Lillian Hellman in the 1930s.\n\nRachel Crothers opened doors for women in the theater before World War II. She was also known as a philanthropist and activist. She established a number of organizations to improve the welfare of her theatrical colleagues: the United Theatre Relief Committee, the Stage Relief Fund (director from 1932 to 1951), the Stage Women's War Relief Fund, and the American Theatre Wing for War Relief, which operated the famed Stage Door Canteen, and remained its executive director until 1950. On April 25, 1939, Crothers was awarded the Chi Omega sorority national achievement award by Eleanor Roosevelt, a gold medal award given “to an American woman of notable accomplishments in the professions, public affairs, art, letters, business and finance, or education.\"\n\nAccording to her biography on Literature OnLine, Rachel Crothers \"distinguished herself as one of the most significant American playwrights of the early twentieth century and as an influential force in the development of modern drama.\" A \"genuine trailblazer\" was Ethan Mordden's description of her in his history of Broadway, \"All That Glitters.\" Crothers, who never married, died in her Danbury, Connecticut home in 1958 at the age of seventy-nine.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the capital of the province of South Cotabato and regional administrative center of SOCCSKSARGEN (Region XII).\n\nKoronadal became a component city of South Cotabato by virtue of Republic Act 8803 dated October 8, 2000. In 2003 and 2005 the city was recognized as \"Most Competitive City\" in the small-city category, and in 2005 and 2006 as the most business friendly city in Mindanao.\n\nKoronadal City is also one of the Planned Cities of the Philippines that were signed by congress on 1965.\n\nKoronadal City is one of the two cities in Mindanao where majority of the citizens are ethnic Hiligaynons, who comprise 95% of the city's population, the other being Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat.\n\nThe settlement of Koronadal and its creation as a municipality by virtue of Executive Order No. #82 dated August 18, 1947 was marked by a rapid initial development, so that when the province of South Cotabato was created under Republic Act No. 4849 on July 18, 1966, it easily became the capital town. In the past, the place was populated by Blaan people and Maguindanaos. The word Koronadal is believed to have been derived from two Blaan words- \"kalon\" meaning cogon grass, and \"nadal\" or \"datal\" meaning plain, which aptly described the place to the natives. On the other hand, Marbel, which is another name for the poblacion, is a Blaan term \"marb el\" which means \"murky waters\" referring to a river, now called the Marbel River.\n\nKoronadal City used to comprise the area extending from the banks of Buluan Lake to the north to Barangay Polonoling in the municipality of Tupi, South Cotabato to the south from Quezon mountain range to the northeast to the municipality of T'boli, South Cotabato to the southeast.\n\nIt was on August 18, 1947 when President Manuel Roxas signed the Executive Order creating the municipalities in the entire province of Cotabato, one of which was Marbel (now Koronadal). The same executive order likewise mandated the official function of the municipal government which began after the qualification and election of the first set of municipal officials.\nThe municipal government of Koronadal began its official function on January 1, 1948 with an approved Annual Estimated Budget of P30,000.00. The land area of the municipality by then was comparable with the Province of Bata-an embracing the present municipalities of Tampakan, Tupi, Banga, Lake Sebu, Surallah, T'boli, South Cotabato, Santo Niño, Norala, and Isulan.\n\nMunicipal Council Resolution No. 32, Series of 1948 mandated and proclaimed January 10 of each year as the Municipal Town Fiesta commemorating the foundation of Marbel Settlement District of the National Land Settlement.\n\nKoronadal was converted into a component city of South Cotabato, now officially known as the City of Koronadal by virtue of Republic Act 8803 on October 8, 2000. At present, Koronadal City is a fast-developing growth center composed of twenty-seven (27) barangays including the four (4) zones in the poblacion. Being the capital city of South Cotabato, it is the center of the province in terms of political, cultural and socio-economic activities.\n\nBy virtue of Executive Order No. 304 signed by then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Koronadal City was named as the Regional political and socio-economic center of SOCCSKSARGEN on March 30, 2004. Regional departments, bureaus and offices were ordered to move from Cotabato City, the former Regional Center of the Region.\n\nKoronadal City is politically subdivided into twenty-seven Barangays with four zones in the Poblacion area. Eight of which are on the Urban area while the remaining nineteen are located on the Rural area.\n\nThe B'laan people are one of the indigenous peoples of the Southern Philippine island of Mindanao. Another tribe called the Maguindanao also inhabits the same area. The two tribes consider themselves to be brothers and sisters. Long ago, an Arab male (ancestral brother) married a B'laan female (ancestral sister) and through this marriage union, Islam infiltrated Southern Mindanao so that when the Spaniards arrived, their attempts to establish Catholicism were unsuccessful in the south. Eventually the B'laan and the Maguindanao became trade partners with the B'laan settling in the mountains and the Maguindanao settling along the coastal areas. From that time until now, the B'laans have been producing rice, vegetables, livestock, and rainforest products. The original religion of the Blaan is Animist. Presently, only 5% of the 8,000 B'laan tribal people are considered to be evangelical.\n\nThe Catholic Filipinos make up the great majority (over 70%) of the Southern Philippine population. They are relatively newcomers to the area; the first wave of Christian migrants came in the seventeenth century when the Spaniards sought to populate Zamboanga, Jolo, Dapitan and other areas by encouraging people from Luzon and the Visayas to settle there. In the nineteenth century Spanish policy found considerable success in encouraging migrations to Iligan and Cotabato.\n\nThe Americans continued this pattern during their colonial administration. In 1913 the American colonial government provided resources for the establishment of agricultural colonies in Mindanao. By the time the Philippine Commonwealth was established, Mindanao had become a veritable frontier. Wave upon wave of migrants poured into the region, chiefly among them the Hiligaynons, Cebuanos, Ilocanos, and Kapampangans. These people did much to clear the virgin areas of Mindanao and open them to extensive agriculture and industry.\n\nThe cultural diversity of the region is the result of a large influx of migrants from the north over a long period of the region's history. Found here are three main cultural groups: the early Filipinos who belong to various indigenous tribes living in the highlands and remote areas of Mindanao, the Muslim Filipinos who were early converts to Islam and who regard the region as their traditional homeland, and the Catholic Filipinos who founded settlements and communities in the course of their migrations from other parts of the country.\n\nKoronadal also hosted an international activity called Pyesta Kalon Datal: Koronadal International Folkloric Festival in coordination with Conseil international des organisations de festivals de folklore et d'arts traditionnels or the International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Art (CIOFF) last August 10 to 18, 2015 and August 11 to 18, 2018 and several national activities such as the Palarong Pambansa in 1996 with General Santos and solo in 2007, Mindanao Business Forum, and National Schools Press Conference. On June 12, 2009, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo together with Defense Secretary Gibo Teodoro celebrated the 111th Independence Day in the city, which marks a significant and historic event in the history of Koronadal.\n\n\n\nSm City Koronadal\n\nHealth Facilities in Koronadal are also widely distributed to all Marbeleños.

It was performed by \"The Simpsons\" cast member Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson), with backing vocals from Michael Jackson, alongside additional vocals from Dan Castellaneta (voice of Homer Simpson). It was produced by Michael Jackson and written by American recording artist Bryan Loren, and released as a single on November 20, 1990. \n\nDespite receiving much radio airplay in the United States, \"Do the Bartman\" was never officially released as a single there. It topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, it reached the Top 10 in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands, and was certified gold in the United Kingdom. \n\nA music video, directed by Brad Bird, was released for the song in 1991. The video became a hit on the American network MTV, and received a nomination at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe album \"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\" was released in September 1990. The first single from it was the rap song \"Do the Bartman\", performed by Bart Simpson's voice actor Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. Rumors began spreading in the summer of 1990 that Michael Jackson would write a song for Bart on the album. \n\nThis song was reported early on to be \"Do the Bartman\", but executive producer James L. Brooks issued a press release in September 1990 apologizing for the misunderstanding and stating that song was actually written by one of Jackson's friends, Bryan Loren.\n\nHowever, \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening later stated during an appearance at the February 1998 World Animation Celebration convention in Pasadena, California that \"Do the Bartman\" was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson, but he could not receive credit for it because he was under contract to Epic Records. Groening told a crowd at the convention that had gathered for a \"\"The Simpsons\" tribute\" that it had \"always [been] amazing to me that no one ever found out that Michael Jackson wrote that song. [...] He was a big fan of the show.\"\n\nJackson was a fan of \"The Simpsons\", especially Bart, and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number one single and do a guest spot on the show, which is how \"Do the Bartman\" came about. Jackson eventually guest-starred in the episode \"Stark Raving Dad\" (season three, 1991) under the pseudonym John Jay Smith. \n\nHe also wrote the song \"Happy Birthday Lisa\" for the episode \"Stark Raving Dad\", which was later included in the album \"Songs in the Key of Springfield\". Bryan Loren has stated that Jackson had provided background vocals for \"Do the Bartman\".\n\nIn July 2015, when Bryan Loren was selling the publishing and songwriting rights for the song, Loren stated that \"despite Matt Groening's repeated confessions, I am the sole writer of the song\". Loren stated that Jackson's contributions included back up vocals, providing the title \"Do the Bartman\" and that Jackson insisted his own name be mentioned in the lyrics.\n\nCritical reviews of the song were mostly positive. Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described it as \"not bad,\" and commented that Bart's high voice \"echoes the beats nicely.\" The Daily Vault's Benny Balneg liked that the song disengaged itself from the album's \"blues tag\" and incorporated more \"contemporary elements\" into its sound. He added that he thought the song had a \"catchy beat\" and an \"infectious chorus.\" \n\nThe \"Long Beach Press-Telegram\"'s Patricia Smith called \"Do the Bartman\" a \"surprisingly funky tune.\" Monika Bartyzel of Cinematical, however, thought the song was a \"cheesy number.\"\n\nThe song topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. In the latter country, the song spent three weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, and became Britain's seventh best selling song of 1991. \"Do the Bartman\" has shipped at least 400,000 units in the United Kingdom, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry on February 1, 1991. The song's success in the United Kingdom was remarkable, given that at that time \"The Simpsons\" was airing only on British satellite television station Sky One. It would be five years before it first aired on analogue television in Britain, airing on BBC One and later BBC Two.\n\nIn Ireland, \"Do the Bartman\" spent nine weeks at number one on the Irish Singles Chart from January 24, 1991 to March 24, 1991. Only nine singles have ever managed a longer run at number one in that country. The song also charted at number one on New Zealand's RIANZ Singles Chart on the issue date of January 25, 1991, and peaked at number one on the chart again, for a total of two weeks, from February 8, 1991 to February 15, 1991.\n\nIn March 1991, \"Do the Bartman\" became the first single to reach number one in Australia that was not available on 7-inch vinyl.\n\nThe music video features the typical plot of Bart rebelling against authority when he decides to put his own spin on a rigidly choreographed dance presentation at Springfield Elementary School. The music video for \"Do the Bartman\" was directed by Brad Bird, with dance choreography by Michael Chambers. Nobody from the staff of \"The Simpsons\" wanted to direct it because they were busy doing the show, but Bird finally agreed to do it after having been asked four times. He had a very short amount of time to finish the video because it was supposed to coincide with the release of \"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\".\n\nThe entire music video was storyboarded in only two days in the United States. Bird then got on a plane to Budapest, Hungary, where the video was animated by Varga Studio. They thought the video was going to be animated as simply as the original \"The Simpsons\" shorts, shown on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", so when Bird told them that it was going to be done in full animation with no repeated scenes, they \"went into deep shock\". \n\nThe animators added the wraparound at the beginning to set Bart against the crowd and put the video in \"some sort of context.\"\n\nThe video was nominated for Best Special Effects at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. It originally premiered on Fox after the episode \"Bart the Daredevil\" on December 6, 1990, and was the number one music video on rotation on MTV between January and March 1991. Along with the music video for \"Deep, Deep Trouble\", the video was included on \"The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season\" DVD boxset in 2002. Following the death of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009, the music video was broadcast by Fox on June 28, 2009—ahead of a rerun of the episode \"Wedding for Disaster\"—and featured a title card paying tribute to Jackson.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2105188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105188", "title": "Deep, Deep Trouble", "text": "Deep, Deep Trouble\n\n\"Deep, Deep Trouble\" is a rap song from the 1990 \"Simpsons\" album \"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\", sung by the fictional character Bart Simpson (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) about his trouble-making antics. It was written by Matt Groening and DJ Jazzy Jeff and recorded in late 1990. \n\nThe song was released as the second single from the album in early 1991 and an accompanying music video (directed by Gregg Vanzo) was broadcast on television on March 7, 1991. This video has since been released on DVD as part of the 2002 boxset \"The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season\". \n\n\"Deep, Deep Trouble\" charted in several countries around the world, including the top ten in Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Critical reception of the song was positive, with its humorous lyrics and Cartwright's performance being singled out for praise.\n\n\"Deep, Deep Trouble\" appeared on the successful 1990 album \"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\" that features songs sung by the characters from the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\". It was recorded along with the rest of the album during late 1990, at which point the cast members of \"The Simpsons\" were also recording the second season of the series. The song was written by \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening and DJ Jazzy Jeff, and produced by DJ Jazzy Jeff and John Boylan. DJ Jazzy Jeff provided the drum programming, keyboards, and scratches on \"Deep, Deep Trouble\".\n\nThe song is a rap performed by the character Bart Simpson about his trouble-making antics. Groening has described it as \"the tragic story of Bart Simpson, a bad youth gone worse.\" \"The Simpsons\" cast member Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart on the show, provided the character's voice in \"Deep, Deep Trouble\" as well. The characters Homer Simpson and Maggie Simpson are also featured, with Homer ranting at Bart, and Maggie sucking on her pacifier to the beat of the song.\n\n\"Deep, Deep Trouble\" was released in early 1991 as the second single from \"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\" after \"Do the Bartman\", which also features Bart rapping. That single achieved much popularity, placing first on the singles charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and eventually becoming certified gold in the latter country with 400,000 units sold. In Ireland, \"Do the Bartman\" spent nine weeks at number one on the Irish Singles Chart—only seven singles have ever managed a longer run at number one there.\n\nThe song received a positive response from critics. Sommer Swindell of the \"Observer-Reporter\" commented that \"after listening to [\"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\"] once, no one will forget 'Deep, Deep Trouble' [...] It would be hard not to crack a smile while listening closely to the lyrics, as they are very creative and humorous.\" Thor Christensen of \"The Milwaukee Journal\" wrote that Bart \"gets in a few good yuks\" in the song, and Walt Belcher of \"The Tampa Tribune\" reported that Bart \"raps out an amusing story about his misadventures while mowing the lawn\". \"The Orange County Register\"s Cary Darling noted that \"Bart turning his life into a hip-hop autobiography on 'Deep, Deep Trouble' is an absolute joy.\" Cartwright's rapping was praised by Tom Hopkins of the \"Dayton Daily News\".\n\nCommercially, the single was not as successful as \"Do the Bartman\", but it still charted high in a few countries, reaching number one in Ireland, the top 10 in the UK and New Zealand, and the top 20 in Sweden.\n\nThe music video for the single premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 7, 1991 together with the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Bart's Dog Gets an F\" of the series' second season. When \"Do the Bartman\" was released it was also accompanied by a music video, which ended up being nominated for Best Special Effects at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards and becoming the number one music video on the American network MTV. The version of the song used in the video is an edit, containing less lyrics than the album version.\n\nThe video for \"Deep, Deep Trouble\" illustrates the things Bart raps about in the song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart to hurry up, Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler and as a result he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of \"The Denver Post\" thought the video was not \"nearly as clever as the cartoon\" and that it had \"'promotional gimmick' written all over it.\" \"Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?\" she added.\n\nThe music video features both original animation and old animation from the series and the \"Simpsons\" shorts that aired on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" before they were spun off into \"The Simpsons\" in 1989. Gregg Vanzo directed the video, which, according to him, features quicker character poses than in episodes of the show to allow the animation to match the hip-hop beat. The music video was later included on the 2002 DVD boxset \"The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season\", with audio commentary from its producers.\n"}

{"id": "2105196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105196", "title": "Elkmont, Tennessee", "text": "Elkmont, Tennessee\n\nElkmont is a region situated in the upper Little River Valley of the Great Smoky Mountains of Sevier County, in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Throughout its history, the valley has been home to a pioneer Appalachian community, a logging town, and a resort community. Today, Elkmont is home to a large campground, ranger station, and historic district maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nThe Little River Lumber Company established the town of Elkmont in 1908 as a base for its logging operations in the upper Little River and Jakes Creek areas. By 1910, the company began selling plots of land to hunting and fishing enthusiasts from Knoxville, who established the \"Appalachian Club\" just south of the logging town. In 1912, a resort hotel, the Wonderland Park Hotel, was constructed on a hill overlooking Elkmont. A group of Knoxville businessmen purchased the Wonderland in 1919 and established the \"Wonderland Club.\" Over the next two decades, the Appalachian Club and Wonderland Club evolved into elite vacation areas where East Tennessee's wealthy could gather and socialize.\n\nUpon the creation of the national park in the 1930s, most of Elkmont's cottage owners were given lifetime leases. These were converted to 20-year leases in 1952, and renewed in 1972. The National Park Service refused to renew the leases in 1992, and under the park's general management plan, the hotel and cottages were to be removed. In 1994, however, the Wonderland Hotel and several dozen of the Elkmont cottages were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Elkmont Historic District, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, sparking a 15-year debate over the fate of the historic structures. In 2009, the National Park Service announced plans to restore the Appalachian Clubhouse and 18 cottages and outbuildings in the Appalachian Club area (which were older and more historically significant) and remove all other structures, including the Wonderland Annex (the main hotel had collapsed in 2005).\n\nElkmont is situated in a narrow but relatively flat valley created by the junction of Little River and Jakes Creek. Steep ridges surround the valley on all sides, with Meigs Mountain rising to the west, Sugarland Mountain rising to the east, and Cove Mountain rising to the north. To the south is Blanket Mountain, with the slopes of Clingmans Dome and Mount Collins beyond.\n\nThe source of Little River is approximately five miles above Elkmont along the slopes of Clingmans Dome, where it begins as a small trickle before its confluence with several smaller streams at an area known as Three Forks. In just over a mile, the river gains strength as it absorbs Meigs Post Prong, Rough Creek, and Fish Camp Prong before its junction with Jakes Creek at Elkmont. Just beyond Elkmont, the river turns sharply to the west toward its junction with Middle Prong at a popular swimming area known as the \"Y\".\n\nHistorically, Elkmont has been divided into three sections. The Wonderland Club section— the former location of the Wonderland Hotel and associated cottages— crowns a hill in the northeastern part of Elkmont. The section containing the Elkmont campground and ranger station— which was once home to the Little River Lumber Company logging town— is located at the center of Elkmont, north of the confluence of Little River and Jakes Creek. The Appalachian Club section is located primarily in the southern part of Elkmont, south of the confluence of Little River and Jakes Creek. The Appalachian Club section itself is divided into three smaller sections— \"Daisy Town\" between the mouths of Jakes Creek and Bearwallow Branch, \"Society Hill\" further south along the banks of Jakes Creek, and \"Millionaires' Row\" further east along the banks of Little River.\n\nThe area known as Elkmont, Tennessee was initially inhabited by the First Peoples. The first known permanent European inhabitants resided along Jakes Creek in the 1840s. The creek's namesake, Jacob Hauser (c. 1791-1870), was probably the first to arrive. He was followed shortly thereafter by the family of David Ownby (1816-1889), who came to the area to search for gold. The small community that developed in the valley was known simply as \"Little River\". Like most Appalachian communities, the residents of Little River developed a subsistence agricultural economy. Most residents grew corn and apples and kept bees for honey. Several gristmills arose along Jakes Creek.\n\nOnly two structures remain from the pioneer period in Elkmont— the Avent cabin (constructed c. 1850) and the Levi Trentham cabin (constructed c. 1830). Originally built by the Ownby family, the Avent cabin was sold in 1918 to the family of noted Nashville artist Mayna Avent, who used it as an art studio until 1940. The Levi Trentham cabin was originally located in the upper reaches of Jakes Creek, and moved to the Appalachian Club's Daisy Town section in 1932 for use as a guest house.\n\nLem Ownby, David Ownby's legendary grandson, was born near Jakes Creek in 1889. In 1908, Ownby and his father built a cabin about a mile or so above the confluence of Jakes Creek and Little River where Ownby lived for the rest of his life. Ownby obtained a lifetime lease when the national park was established, and for several decades afterward sold honey to hikers. Among those who paid Ownby a visit were Tennessee governor (and later U.S. senator) Lamar Alexander and U.S. Supreme Court justices Harry Blackmun and Potter Stewart. The Justices were visiting a prominent Knoxville lawyer, Foster Arnett, who wanted to introduce them to a real mountain man. Foster led the two Justices up the trail to meet Lem only to discover Lem would not meet the two men. When Foster knocked on Lem's door and announced that he had two Supreme Court Justices outside who wanted to meet him, Lem simply replied that they were not welcome to come in the cabin. Foster was very embarrassed while the two Justices folded over laughing. The two Justices loved that Lem had refused to meet them because he was the one person who would tell them no, something they seldom found. Reportedly the story was one shared for years among the Justices on the Supreme Court. Ownby died in 1984, the last of the park's lifetime lessees outside of Cades Cove.\n\nIn the 1880s, Knoxville businessman John L. English began a small-scale logging project along Jakes Creek. To transport the logs to a sawmill on the outskirts of Knoxville, English constructed a series of splash dams along Little River. When the logs were ready to be moved, the floodgates of these dams were opened and the rushing torrent carried the logs downstream. While English managed a moderate profit, his venture had folded by 1900, possibly because of a disastrous flood along Little River in 1899.\n\nIn 1901, Pennsylvania entrepreneur Colonel Wilson B. Townsend purchased of land along Little River and established the Little River Lumber Company. Townsend set up a band saw mill in Tuckaleechee Cove, laying the foundation for the town that would later bear his name. Rather than splash dams, which are at the mercy of the volatile mountain streams, Townsend constructed a logging railroad between the company's sawmill in Tuckaleechee and the river's upper reaches, all the way to the Three Forks area (where the river absorbs Fish Camp Prong and Rough Creek). The railroad was later extended to Walland, connecting it to Maryville and Knoxville. The railroad employed 10 Shay engines to move the log-filled flatcars along the river valley. Logging skidders were used to pull trees from the steeper slopes. Elkmont was established in 1908 as a transfer station where logs were moved from gear-operated trains (used for reaching higher elevations) to rod-operated trains for transport to the sawmill at Townsend.\n\nEarly Elkmont was a typical temporary logging camp. These camps bore a resemblance to later Depression-era shanty towns. Shanty houses (or \"set off\" houses), a post office, a transient hotel, a commissary, and sheds critical to railroad maintenance were the town's only buildings. Many loggers lived in boarding houses, and some crossed Sugarland Mountain via a trail connecting Elkmont to the Sugarlands. As logging operations progressed, it became necessary to move the camp higher up the mountain slopes to the south. The company managed this by loading the shanties onto railroad flatcars and moving them to pre-constructed foundations using a logging crane. Although the logging camps moved, Elkmont remained the company's primary base of operations in the upper Little River valley.\n\nIn 1926, Townsend sold most of his Little River Lumber tract to the newly created Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, although he had been given permission to continue logging for most of the next decade. By the time the company ceased operations in 1939, it had produced 750 million board feet (1.8 million m³) of lumber. In the 1960s, the park service built the current campground over the site of the former logging town. Little remains from Elkmont's logging period, although three of the later resort cottages (including the Addicks and Mayo cabins) are believed to have been modified Little River Lumber Company shanty houses.\n\nIn his company's early days, Townsend allowed hunters and fishermen to use the Little River Railroad to access the deep, game-rich forests of the Smokies. As the Elkmont valley was slowly stripped of its valuable timber, Townsend began to advertise the area as a mountain getaway. In 1909, Little River Railroad began offering the Sunday \"Elkmont Special\"— non-stop train service from Knoxville to Elkmont. In 1910, an affluent group of Knoxville hunting and fishing enthusiasts formed the Appalachian Club and purchased what is now \"Daisy Town\" south of the confluence of Little River and Jakes Creek. They built the Appalachian Clubhouse for use as a lodge. Within a few years, several clubmembers built cottages, and the club evolved into a mountain getaway for Knoxville's elite.\n\nIn 1911, Townsend gave Charles Carter several acres of land on a hill overlooking Elkmont with the stipulation that Carter build on it within one year. In 1912, Carter made good on the promise when he opened the Wonderland Hotel. Billed as a resort lodge, the hotel contained 50 rooms with an extensive balcony looking out over the valley and Meigs Mountain. As membership in the Appalachian Club proved remarkably difficult to obtain, several rejected Knoxvillians purchased the Wonderland Hotel site and formed the Wonderland Club in 1919. Along with the hotel, 10 or so cottages were erected on the hill.\n\nIn 1925, Little River Lumber Company concluded its logging operations in the Three Forks area and sought to move the Elkmont tracks to the recently acquired Walker Valley (now Tremont). Fearing a lawsuit from cottage owners, Townsend ordered the tracks to be pulled up and moved in secret. Elkmont residents were outraged. Fortunately, however, the railroad grades were perfect for road construction. In 1926, thanks largely to Tennessee Governor Austin Peay (who owned a cottage at Elkmont), a road was constructed connecting Townsend with both the Wonderland Club and Appalachian Club areas. During its construction, members of the Metcalf family, who owned a farm just west of Elkmont, supplied the workers with drinking water. In appreciation, a large picnic area between Elkmont and Wears Valley was named Metcalf Bottoms.\n\nIn 1920, Willis P. Davis and his wife Anne, who owned a summer cottage at Elkmont, began to suggest an idea for a national park in the Smokies after a visit to Yellowstone. While the Davises merely suggested the idea to influential friends in Knoxville, it was another Elkmont cottage-owner, David C. Chapman, who took the initiative. Business owners in Knoxville quickly saw the benefits of a national park and began lobbying federal and state governments.\n\nAfter the U.S. government agreed to establish the national park if the states of Tennessee and North Carolina purchased the land, Knoxville began an intensive lobbying campaign aimed at the Tennessee legislature. In 1925, Chapman hosted a group of legislators at Elkmont to sell the park idea. The following year, Colonel Townsend made the initial sale.\n\nWhile Elkmont was the birth of the park movement, it was also home to one of the strongest anti-park movements. Shortly after the Townsend purchase, an attorney for Little River Lumber Company named Jim Wright rallied a hodge-podge group of attorneys, businessmen, and mountaineers at Elkmont to propose the establishment of a national forest rather than a national park. Wright also proposed a massive road-building campaign across the crest of the Smokies in hopes of increasing the land's value. Largely because of Wright's efforts, the initial bill allowing for the purchase of land in the Smokies exempted Elkmont from eminent domain. Cottage owners managed to gain a provision that allowed them to sell their cottages at half-price in exchange for lifetime leases.\n\nTo gain better electricity service and to assure the electric utility a steady supply of customers instead of a slow attrition of expiring lifetime leaseholders, most of the Appalachian Club members agreed to convert their lifetime leases to 20 year leases. There was assurance of lease renewals and this occurred in 1972. Under the influence of environmental groups, especially the Sierra Club, the 1992 renewal did not occur. The Wonderland Hotel and the rustic cottages at Elkmont (other than two cottages which kept leases expiring in 2001) reverted to the National Park Service. The park's 1982 General Management Plan calls for all structures to be removed to allow nature to reclaim the affected areas. However, in 1994, the Wonderland Hotel and several of the rustic cottages were placed on the National Register of Historic Places, giving them a special status. A debate immediately ensued over the fate of these structures.\n\nIn 2005, the Wonderland Hotel collapsed from a structural failure. Parts of the hotel deemed to have historical value were removed and the rest cleared, leaving only the annex and a chimney. In May 2016 the annex suffered a devastating fire, which is currently under investigation.\n\nIn its 2009 Final Environmental Impact Statement for Elkmont, the National Park Service announced plans to restore the Appalachian Clubhouse and eighteen cabins in the Appalachian Club section. The remaining structures were carefully documented and removed in 2018 but many chimneys remain\n\nSeventeen of the nineteen structures chosen for restoration and preservation are located in the Appalachian Club's \"Daisy Town\" section. These were selected primarily as the oldest and most historically notable structures in the historic district. The structures include the Appalachian Clubhouse (built in 1934 to replace the original, which had burned in 1932), the Levi Trentham cabin (Elkmont's oldest surviving structure, built in 1830), the Addicks cabin and Mayo cabin (both believed to be modified lumber company shanties, or \"set\" houses), and a children's playhouse known as \"Adamless Eden.\" Most of the cottages were built between 1910 and 1930, and renovated numerous times over subsequent decades (many of the porches were added in the 1970s). The cottages are typically of balloon frame construction with board and batten exteriors, the exceptions being the Smith cabin and the Levi Trentham cabin, which are log cabins.\n\nThe Byers cabin— located south of Daisy Town in the Appalachian Club's Society Hill section, was also chosen for preservation, due largely to its association with early park promoter David Chapman. The Spence cabin, a large lodge in the Appalachian Club's Millionaires' Row section, has been restored and preserved primarily for its location at the head of the Little River Trail and is available for reservations as a day use structure. All structures will be removed from the Wonderland Club section of Elkmont, and a kiosk will be placed on the site of the Wonderland Hotel to interpret the hotel's history.\n\n\n"}

The group was an offshoot of the Karen National Union. They were based along the Thailand-Burma border, and conducted a string of audacious guerrilla actions—including allegedly being involved in the seizure of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok-during the 1990s and early 2000s. They have been described as a terrorist organisation.\n\nGod's Army was formed in an area of eastern Burma populated by the Karen ethnic group, who had been fighting against Burmese army at various times for over fifty years, primarily through the Karen National Union. In the early 90s the Burmese army launched a major operation to secure the route of an oil pipeline through the area. God's Army was led by brothers Johnny and Luther Htoo beginning in 1997, who were at that time estimated to be only ten years of age. Some of the followers of the twins believed that they had \"Animist and Christian powers\". According to the legend among followers, the twins were the only two who defended their village from the Burmese authorities who had constantly persecuted their people for their Christian beliefs and for a desire for ethnic autonomy. The Burmese authorities had destroyed villages, killed Karen fighters, raped dozens of women and caused thousands to flee. The members believed the brothers shouted \"God's Army!\", leading them to a victory over Burmese troops. \nThe legend of the boys was embraced by locals who viewed the existing Karen National Union as corrupt and ineffective. Some of its members also called themselves as <nowiki>\"Jesus Warriors\" or \"Jesus Commandos\". According to Kwe Htoo, the name of the group was actually Kaserdoh God'</nowiki>s Army.\n\nGod's Army was situated in mountainous rainforests along the border between Burma and Thailand. They were a band of Christian guerrillas who maintained an austere lifestyle, including abstinence from sexual intercourse, alcohol, milk, eggs and pork. The group was estimated to have around 500 fighters in 1998, but gradually declined to anywhere between 100 and 200 men in early 2000. Many left to find work to support their refugee families while others are thought to have left due to personal reasons. Meanwhile, the Burmese army had 21,000 troops in the area.\n\nIn October 1999, a group calling themselves Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors along with the God's Army seized the Burmese embassy in Bangkok and the situation ended with their departure, at which point they were taken in by God's Army. The Burmese Government called the attack \"a pure act of terrorism\" and in Washington the State Department, which has been critical of the Burmese military regime, also condemned what it called \"a terrorist attack\".\n\nIn January 2000, 10 members of God's Army seized a hospital in Ratchaburi, Thailand. The group held 700 to 800 patients and staff members hostage for 22 hours. They demanded the Thai government stop shelling Karen positions in Burma and treatment for their wounded. They planted \"booby\" traps in the hospital and threatened to blow up the hospital. Thai security forces stormed the hospital, killing all 10 of the gunmen. After the raid, God's Army were strenuously pursued by the Tatmadaw (Burmese armed forces) and shunned by other Karen rebels.\n\nIn January 2001, the Htoo twins and the less than 20 remaining members of God's Army surrendered to Thai soldiers and requested sanctuary. They abandoned the Karens' goal of an autonomous or independent homeland, in exchange for permission to stay in Thailand. \n\nIn July 2006, Johnny Htoo surrendered to Burma's military government with eight other members of God's Army in two groups.\n\n"}

{"id": "2105251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105251", "title": "Brownsover", "text": "Brownsover\n\nBrownsover is a residential and commercial area of Rugby, Warwickshire in England, about miles north of the town centre. The area is named after the original hamlet of Brownsover. Since 1960, the area has been subsumed by the expansion of Rugby, with the construction of a number of housing estates, industrial estates and retail parks.\n\nThe original hamlet of Brownsover still exists, to the west of A426 \"Leicester Road\". It was originally a hamlet within the parish of Clifton-upon-Dunsmore, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book as \"Gaura\". In 1932 it was incorporated into the borough of Rugby. \n\nBrownsover Hall is situated here, this country house was rebuilt in the Victorian era by the Ward-Boughton-Leigh family who were the principal landowners in the area. The hall has now become a large hotel and conference centre. Brownsover Hall is also where Frank Whittle developed the jet engine in the 1930s.\n\nThe hamlet also contains an old house which is one place where Lawrence Sheriff (c1515-1567), the founder of Rugby School, may have been born, although it is more likely he was born in Rugby. Sheriff certainly had links to Brownsover, as he purchased the rectory and farm of Brownsover in 1562.\n\nThe old (C of E) parish church of St. Michael & All Angels was founded in the 12th century as a chapel of ease, and was almost entirely rebuilt by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1877 for Allesley Boughton-Leigh. The church has an interesting collection of English and foreign carved woodwork, including a splendid organ case, made in 1660 for St John's College, Cambridge. There is one armorial monumental inscription in the floor of the church, the grave of John Howkins (1579-1678), a wealthy lawyer who owned the estate of \"Pinchbank\" in South Mimms, Middlesex. He was the great-nephew of Lawrence Sheriff. The church is now closed to regular use and has been replaced by a modern place of worship - Christchurch in Helvellyn Way, new Brownsover. Brownsover is mentioned in Tom Brown's Schooldays.\n\nThe new part of Brownsover, to the east of Leicester Road, contains modern housing estates built mostly during the 1960s and 70s. More recently, several building programmes have been completed, specifically in the areas referred to as 'Strawberry Fields' and 'Rectory Gardens', in the 1990s, with two other projects nearing completion. These two relatively new developments are considered more to the standards of the areas such as Hillmorton and are very near to Clifton upon dunsmore.\nThere are three local schools: Boughton Leigh Infants and Boughton Leigh Junior, which share a campus, and there is also the newer Brownsover Community School. The local church, Christchurch in Helvellyn Way, is an ecumenical project involving Anglicans, Methodists and Baptists. Brownsover has a number of green spaces as well as the canal.\n\nPrimary education is provided by Boughton Leigh Junior School and Boughton Leigh Infant school, and Brownsover Community Infants School.\n\nThe Oxford Canal runs through the Brownsover area. The original canal was built in the late 18th century, and was straightened out in the 1820s. Part of the original abandoned route of the canal was retained to act as a water feeder from the River Swift; this stretch known as the 'Brownsover Arm' is no longer navigable, but is still water filled. The land around the old canal arm became the Swift Valley Nature Reserve in 2003.\n\n"}

{"id": "2105267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105267", "title": "Sétif and Guelma massacre", "text": "Sétif and Guelma massacre\n\nThe Sétif and Guelma massacre was a series of attacks by French colonial authorities and Pied-noir settler militias on Algerian civilians in 1945 around the market town of Sétif, west of Constantine, in French Algeria. French police fired on demonstrators at a protest on 8 May 1945. Riots in the town were followed by attacks on French settlers (\"colons\") in the surrounding countryside, resulting in 102 deaths. Subsequent attacks by the French colonial authorities and European settlers caused deaths among the Muslim population of the region, thought to number between 6,000 and 20,000. Both the outbreak and the indiscriminate nature of its repression are thought to have marked a turning point in Franco-Algerian relations, leading to the Algerian War of 1954–1962.\n\nThe anti-colonialist movement had started organizing itself before World War II, under Messali Hadj and Ferhat Abbas. However, the participation of Algeria in the war had a major impact on the rise of nationalism. Algeria served as the capital of the Free France from 1943, which created hope for many nationalists. Ferhat Abbas published in 1943 a manifesto that claimed the right for Algerians to have a constitution and a state associated with France. The lack of French response to this text inspired the creation of the \"\"Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté\"\" (AML) and the rise of nationalism, leading to thousand-person protests in such cities as Mostaganem in the previous weeks. Contemporary factors other than those of the emergence of Arab nationalism included widespread drought and famine in the Constantine region, in a region where the European settlers were a minority: in the city of Guelma, there were 4,000 settlers for 16,500 Muslim Algerians. This situation led to the spreading of conspiracy theories among the settler community and local administration, that started creating or supporting armed militias. With the end of World War II, 4,000 protesters took to the streets of Sétif, a town in northern Algeria, to press new demands for independence on the French administration.\n\nThe initial outbreak occurred on the morning of 8 May 1945, the same day that Nazi Germany surrendered in World War II. A parade of about 5,000 people of the Muslim Algerian population of Sétif to celebrate the victory ended in clashes between the marchers and the local French gendarmerie, when the latter tried to seize banners attacking colonial rule. There is uncertainty over who fired first but both protesters and police were shot. A smaller and peaceful protest of Algerian People's Party activists in the neighboring town of Guelma was violently repressed by the colonial police the same evening. News from Sétif acted as a match on the poor and nationalist rural population, and led to attacks on \"pieds-noirs\" in the Sétif countryside (Kherrata, Chevreul) that resulted in the deaths of 102 European colonial settlers (12 in Guelma), plus another hundred wounded.\n\nAfter five days of chaos, the French colonial military and police suppressed the rebellion, and then carried out a series of attacks on civilians for the attacks on French colonial settlers. The army, which included Foreign Legion, Moroccan and Senegalese troops, carried out summary executions in the course of a \"ratissage\" (\"raking-over\") of Muslim rural communities suspected of involvement. Less accessible \"mechtas\" (Muslim villages) were bombed by French aircraft, and the cruiser \"Duguay-Trouin\", standing off the coast in the Gulf of Bougie, shelled Kherrata. \"Pied-noir\" vigilantes lynched prisoners taken from local jails or randomly shot Muslims not wearing white arm bands (as instructed by the army) out of hand. It is certain that the great majority of the Muslim victims had not been implicated in the original outbreak.\n\nFrench repression in the Guelma region differed from that in Sétif in that while only 12 pied-noirs had been killed in the countryside, attacks on civilians lasted until 26 June. The Constantine \"préfet\", Lestrade-Carbonnel had supported the creation of European settler militias, while the Guelma \"sous-préfet\", André Achiari, created an informal justice system (\"Comité de Salut Public\") designed to encourage the violence of the settler vigilantism against unarmed civilians, and to facilitate the identification and murder of nationalist activists. He also instructed police and army intelligence agencies to assist the settler militias. Muslim victims killed in both urban and rural areas were buried in mass graves in places like Kef-el-Boumba, but the corpses were later dug up and burned in Héliopolis.\n\nThese attacks were initially reported to have killed between 1,020 (the official French figure given in the Tubert Report shortly after the massacre) and 45,000 Algerian Muslims (as claimed by Radio Cairo at the time). Horne notes that 6,000 was the figure finally settled on by moderate historians, while Jean-Pierre Peyroulou, crossing Allies' statistics and Marcel Reggui's testimony concludes that a range from 15,000 to 20,000 is likely, contesting Jean-Louis Planche's 20,000 to 30,000 deaths estimation. The identity of the Muslim Algerian victims differed in Sétif and Guelma. In the countryside outside Sétif, some victims were actual nationalists who had taken part in the insurrection but the majority were uninvolved civilians who had only lived in the same area. However, in Guelma nationalist activists were specifically targeted by French settler vigilantes. Most were male (13% of the men in Guelma were killed), either members of the AML, the Muslim scouts or the local CGT.\n\nThe Sétif outbreak and the repression that followed marked a turning point in the relations between France and the Muslim population under its control since 1830, when France had colonized Algeria. While the details of the Sétif killings were largely overlooked in metropolitan France, the impact on the Algerian Muslim population was traumatic, especially on the large numbers of Muslim soldiers in the French Army who were then returning from the war in Europe. Nine years later, a general uprising began in Algeria, leading to independence from France in March 1962 with the signing of the Évian Accords.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1988, the massacres of Sétif and Guelma were commemorated in Algeria, but it was considered as a minor event compared to November 1, 1954, the beginning of the Algerian war for independence, which legitimized the one-party regime. The members of the FLN, as rebels and as State members did not want to emphasize the importance of May 1945: it would have involved remembering that there were other contradictory currents of nationalism, such as Messali Hadj's Algerian National Movement that opposed the FLN. With the democratization movement of 1988, Algerians \"rediscovered\" a History different from the one told by the regime, as the regime itself was questioned. Research about the massacres of May 1945 was conducted, as well as a memorial will to remember these events. The presidency of Liamine Zéroual and Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and also the Fondation du 8 Mai 1945 also started using the memories of the massacres as a political tool to discuss the consequences of the \"colonial genocide\" with France.\n\nThe words used to refer to the events are often instrumentalized or carry a memorial connotation. The word \"massacre\", currently applied in historical research to the Muslim Algerian victims of May 1945, was first used in French propaganda in reference to the 102 European colonial settler victims; apparently to justify the French suppression. The word \"genocide\", used by Bouteflika for example, does not apply to the events in Guelma, since the Algerian victims there were reportedly targeted because of their nationalist activism; which might make the Guelma massacre a politicide according to B. Harff and Ted R. Gurr's definition. The term \"massacre\" is, according to Jacques Sémelin a more useful methodological tool for historians to study an event whose definition is debated.\n\nIn February 2005, Hubert Colin de Verdière, France's ambassador to Algeria, formally apologized for the massacre, calling it an \"inexcusable tragedy\", in what was described as \"the most explicit comments by the French state on the massacre\".\n\nIn 2017, French presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron considered colonialism as \"a crime against humanity\". On 8 May 2020, Algerian President, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, decided to commemorate the day at the 75th anniversary of the massacre.\n\nThe Algerian cinema, an industry where war movies are popular, depicted the massacres more than once. When \"Outside the Law\" by Rachid Bouchareb was nominated for Best Picture in the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, French Pied-Noirs, harkis and war veterans demonstrated against the film being shown in French cinemas, accusing it of distorting reality.\n\n\n\n"}

He studied composition with Ton de Leeuw, percussion with Jan Labordus and Jan Pustjens, and piano at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam.\nAlthough his over 1000 works are composed for conventional European classical instruments, Meijering has a fondness for outrageous titles. Some examples include \"I Hate Mozart\" (for flute, alto saxophone, harp and violin); \"I've Never Seen a Straight Banana\" (for alto saxophone, marimba, piano, harp, and violin); \"If the Camels Don't Get You, the Fatimas Must!\" (for solo violin); and \"Background-Music for Non-Entertainment Use in Order to Cover Unwanted Noise\" (for four saxophones).\n\nBetween July 2016 and March 2018, Meijering composed 117 bassoon concertos and chamber concertos for bassoonist Kathleen McLean, Professor at the Jacobs School of Music, Indiana University, co-principal bassoon of the World Orchestra for Peace and former associate principal bassoon of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. These works are in a one movement form, shifting styles within each piece with influences of folk, jazz, avant garde, funk and classical. Many themes often come from his existing operatic scores and sketches. In addition to these, he also transcribed 55 recorder concertos written for Dan Laurin between 2012-2015 scored now for bassoon and string orchestra. These multi movement works could be described as encore pieces or concertinos. The later concertos are more complex in structure, rhythmically and technically demanding for both the bassoon and string orchestra. McLean assisted Meijering throughout this creative process by proofing and making editing suggestions, often he would ask her for assistance in titles and would request she write down a riff as a personal signature that he would incorporate and expand upon in some of these concertos. Meijering is often inspired by family roots, photographs, art, and daily events. Knowing of her Scottish background, one can hear Celtic melodies weaving throughout the scores as well as American folk, country, darker emotive moods and ribald humor pushing the boundaries technically and expressively for the instrument. Meijering's monumental contribution to the bassoon repertoire is extraordinary and it is proof that he considers the bassoon as a truly soloistic voice. In 2018, also composed several new pieces for bassoon and piano available at Donemus Publishing.\n\nOn October 29, 2016, a recent commission \"whatever lies ahead\" for 12 cellos was premiered in Amsterdam by the 12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic with great success.\nIn 2017, McLean received a grant from FPK Holland for a new commission by Meijering for 12 bassoons and strings \"the reed which bends in the wind\" to be premiered in Bloomington Indiana on March 31, 2018 and later in Granada, Spain at the International Double Reed Society Conference, August 29, 2018 with McLean and a group of celebrated international bassoon artists.\n\n"}

The chain's initial growth was in the mountains of North Carolina and rural areas of Virginia, but, starting in the late 1990s, has geared expansion towards metropolitan areas in North and South Carolina.\n\nUntil October 4, 2009, Lowes Foods used S&H Greenpoints on their store discount card; this was replaced with \"Fresh Rewards\" on October 5, 2009. Many of Lowes Foods stores also offer \"Lowes Foods to Go\", where shoppers can order groceries online and drive to the store to pick them up. Business and home delivery is available at select locations throughout North and South Carolina.\n\nLowes Foods started in 1954 in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, with a single store opened by Jim Lowe (former co-owner of Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, and son of its founder). Lowe sold that store to J. C. Faw. Expansion in Wilkesboro and the mountain regions of NC shortly followed. In 1984, the chain was sold to Merchants Distributors, Inc. (MDI) a grocery distributor based in Hickory, North Carolina. After MDI bought Institution Food House, in 1992, MDI reorganized as a holding company, Alex Lee, Inc., with MDI, IFH and Lowes Foods as subsidiaries. It was named for Alex and Lee George, sons of the MDI founder.\n\nIn 1997, Alex Lee bought Byrd's Food Stores Inc. of Burlington, North Carolina, which had 43 stores. Lowes Foods had 56 stores, few in the area served by Byrd's. The Byrd's stores became Lowes Foods stores. In 2000, Delhaize America had to sell 38 Hannaford stores to satisfy antitrust concerns. Lowes Foods bought 12 of these, six (plus one under construction) in the Research Triangle region and six along the North Carolina coast.\n\nIn 2007, Lowes Foods Foods opened its first fuel station at a Hickory, North Carolina, store. As of August 2016, 14 Lowes Foods stores had fuel stations. Lowes Foods offered a five cent discount per gallon of gas with each $100 spent inside the store (excl. alcohol and gift card purchases) which is redeemable at Lowes Foods fuel stations or any participating Speedway or WilcoHess locations in North and South Carolina.\n\nIn March 2011, Lowes Foods opened a 'frugal cousin' series of stores called Just $ave. These stores are located all in North Carolina and mainly in rural areas, targeting budget-conscious shoppers. The first location opened was in Pilot Mountain, North Carolina. In August 2011, Lowes Foods began the Aisle50 program in the Carolinas, intending to expand to other areas and other chains in the future. Deals from aisle50.com will not likely replace coupons, but shoppers will be able to buy certain products for about half their normal prices.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, the company announced that they were leaving the Charlotte, North Carolina, market by trading ten Charlotte area stores with Harris Teeter for six Western North Carolina stores and $26.5 million in cash. By March 2015, Lowes Foods began shifting its store portfolio and had closed five of the six stores it acquired from Harris Teeter as well as stores in Cary, Newland, West Jefferson, and Greenville, North Carolina. These closures were announced as part of a comprehensive growth strategy that would include rebranding all existing Lowes Foods stores by 2019 and entering into the Greenville, South Carolina market in 2016. Lowes Foods plans to add three to five Greenville stores as part of its growth strategy.\n\nIn August 2016, Lowes Foods announced the closures of two Lowes Foods stores in North Wilkesboro and Shallotte, North Carolina, as well as a Just $ave location in Dobson, North Carolina. In July 2019, the closures of three stores—two in the Hickory, North Carolina-area, as well as the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, location on Cipriana Drive, was announced. The closures are part of an overall investment strategy to accelerate growth.\n\nLowes Foods and Just $ave are considered \"stores\". Fuel Centers are part of actual stores and therefore do not count towards total store counts.\n"}

The film stars Juhi Chawla, Sunny Deol and Shah Rukh Khan while Anupam Kher, Tanvi Azmi and Dalip Tahil appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was well received by critics and audiences, and was declared a \"\"Blockbuster\"\" at the domestic as well as overseas box office. It has attained classic status over the years and is regarded as one of Chopra's best. \"Darr\" was later remade in Kannada as \"Preethse\" and in Tamil as \"Chinna\". \"Darr\" has won several accolades, including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. The film received ten nominations at the 39th Filmfare Awards, including Best Director for Chopra, Best Actress for Chawla, Best Actor for Deol, and Best Villain for Khan, and won two awards, including Best Comedian for Kher.\n\nThe film begins with Kiran (Juhi Chawla), a beautiful college student, returning home to her brother Vijay (Anupam Kher) and his wife Poonam (Tanvi Azmi) for Holi celebrations. She is being obsessively stalked along the way by Rahul (Shahrukh Khan), her classmate who has a crush on her. Kiran's boyfriend Sunil (Sunny Deol) is a Navy-Marine Commando officer and is on a mission to free a child hostage from some terrorists on the high seas. Sunil saves the child hostage. Sunil's Captain Mehra (Dalip Tahil) is also the father of Rahul. Rahul tries to be friendly with Sunil in order to be closer to Kiran.\n\nWhen Kiran reaches home, she is continually stalked by Rahul on the phone. This causes much stress to herself and her family. He crashes Kiran's family's Holi celebrations incognito as a member of the band. Sunil asks Kiran to offer the band some money for their performance, where Rahul, veiled in Holi colours, whispers \"\"I love you, K-K-K-Kiran\"\" to Kiran, which disturbs her greatly and a foot chase ensues to find the hooligan who has invaded their house, but Rahul soon disappears into the crowd.\n\nWhen Rahul receives the news of Kiran and Sunil's engagement, he tries to shoot and kill Sunil when the couple is out shopping for a wedding ring. He misses his aim and Sunil begins to chase him, from which Rahul narrowly escapes being recognized by Sunil.\n\nKiran and Sunil get married but Rahul still refuses to give up on Kiran. He kills the two cops assigned for their protection and defaces the newly married couple's home with graffiti that declares his love and which causes them more distress. To get away from the stalker, Sunil takes Kiran on a surprise honeymoon to Switzerland. Learning their location through devious means, Rahul turns up at their hotel in the Alps. Kiran recognizes him from college and the couple welcomes him to be part of their festivities. That very evening, Sunil finds out from Kiran's brother Vijay that Rahul is the one who has been Kiran's stalker all along. He sends Kiran away on a boat and confronts Rahul. Rahul tries to run, but Sunil catches up with him in a forest where they have a fight. Rahul stabs Sunil with a knife after feigning surrender and leaves him for dead. He then goes to the boat and tries to forcefully abduct Kiran, he wants to marry Kiran without her consent. But Sunil comes back and brutally beats him before shooting and killing him. Kiran and Sunil then return to India and reunite with their family.\n\nThe film was inspired by the 1991 American film \"Cape Fear\". Sanjay Dutt was the original choice of the role of antagonist Rahul, but Chopra was unable to finalize him because of his jail sentence due to illegal possession of arms. Sudesh Berry was then considered for the role, but was rejected after a screen test. Ajay Devgan was offered the role of Rahul, but he could not accept due to other commitments.\n\nLater on, Aamir Khan (who had worked on Chopra's \"Parampara\") was cast as Rahul. Khan later had other issues with the filming as he was not happy with the way Deol's character repeatedly punched his character in a fight sequence. He was further discontented when Chopra selected Divya Bharti for the female lead. Therefore, he opted out of the film although Divya was later replaced by Juhi Chawla.\n\nAfter Aamir Khan left the film, Shah Rukh Khan was cast as Rahul. \"Darr\" helped bring Shah Rukh Khan to stardom and he went on to star in all of Chopra's films. Rishi Kapoor and Jackie Shroff were offered Sunil's role before Sunny Deol. Mithun Chakraborthy was also a strong contender for Sunil's role along with Rishi Kapoor and Jackie Shroff.\n\nNitish Bharadwaj was approached for Sunil's role after Rishi Kapoor and Jackie Shroff rejected the role. This is because of his immense popularity as Lord Krishna's role in B.R. Chopra's \"Mahabharat\". But Nitish rejected the role claiming that the role is not as challenging as it would be.\n\nThe film's title \"Darr\" was suggested to Yash Chopra by Hrithik Roshan and Uday Chopra.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Darr\" was composed by the duo Shiv-Hari (Shiv Kumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia). It was the second best-selling Bollywood soundtrack album of the year. The soundtrack album sold about 4.5million units in India, earning at least . Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood in his review gave the album 7.5 stars out of 10.\n\nAt the domestic Indian box office, \"Darr\" became the third highest-grossing film of 1993, after \"Aankhen\" and \"Khalnayak\", and was declared a blockbuster. In India, it was released on 190 screens, with 19.96million tickets sold. Its domestic gross was 15.73crore, including a net income of 10.74crore, which is equivalent to when adjusted for inflation. Its domestic gross is equivalent to when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAt the overseas box office, \"Darr\" was the year's highest-grossing Indian film of 1993, grossing 5.58crore. Worldwide, it grossed 21.31crore, equivalent to when adjusted for inflation.\n\n\"Darr\" was remade in Kannada as \"Preethse\", starring Upendra as Chandu (Rahul) Shiva Rajkumar as Surya (Sunil) and Bollywood actress Sonali Bendre playing Kiran. The film also partially inspired the 2005 Tamil \"Chinna\", starring Arjun Sarja and Sneha in lead roles. The Telugu film \"Tapassu\" also borrowed some scenes from \"Darr\".\n\nThe teaser trailer of five-part web series \"Darr 2.0\" was released on YouTube on August 30, 2016. It is to be a retelling of the film in a contemporary setting, portraying cyber-stalking and digital crimes. The web series is produced by Ashish Chopra under the banner of Y-Films and is directed by Vikash Chandra. Screenplay and dialogues are by Nikhil Taneja and Shubham Yogi.\n"}

Named as one of the most versatile and accomplished players of her generation, Brava has also performed pop, rock, folk, techno, film, jazz, and world music, among others.\n\nBrava was born into a Swedish-speaking Finnish family in which music formed a vital part of life. Her father, Börje Lampenius (1921–2016), was a former theatre director, actor, singer, and also a composer of musicals and operettas. Her mother, Ulla Eklund, is a former actress and singer. Both of them worked at the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki.\n\nAt age three, Brava began to perform with her parents as a singer. Later on, in addition to her solo and orchestral performances, Brava would play the violin accompanied by her father on the piano, while her mother sang alongside them. In 1978, \"Vasabladet\" reported on Brava, a child violinist to remember, after her impressive solo concert appearance.\n\nAfter leaving Finland in 1997, Brava has lived in Los Angeles, London, and Stockholm. She is married to Martin Cullberg, a Swedish defense lawyer, and they have two daughters: Olivia, born 2009, and Cecilia, born 2013. Brava's parents-in-law are professor Johan Cullberg and psychotherapist Marta Cullberg Weston.\n\nAfter attending a musical kindergarten, Brava began studying the violin at the age of five, under the guidance of Géza Szilvay, the developer of the Colourstrings method. Brava's career then began as a member and soloist of the Helsinki Strings at the age of seven with players two and even three times her age.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Brava toured all around the world with the Helsinki Strings, giving concerts in London, New York City, Tokyo, et cetera. As a child violinist, she also appeared on Finnish TV numerous times as part of the artistic-educational TV series \"Minifiddlers in Musicland\" on YLE.\n\nIn fairly rapid succession, Brava was awarded a scholarship by the Swedish Cultural Foundation for being such a promising young violinist, became Concertmistress of the Helsinki Strings, and performed as a soloist of the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Finland at the age of 11. Around the same time, she was also selected for solo roles within the Helsinki Strings, touring among others in England.\n\nBrava studied at the Sibelius Academy in Finland from 1985 to 1997, first in the youth department and then the Department of Soloists. She was one of the first students to get into the university based only on one's audition performance. At the Sibelius Academy, Brava studied the violin, music theory and history, pedagogy and opera singing, having her own violin students as well. She also played in chamber ensembles, and her Ofelia quartet was chosen to perform in the final concert of the master class course given by the Amadeus Quartet.\n\nStill a student, Brava acquired substantial orchestral experience. From 1990 through 1997, she served as Concertmistress of the Conducting Class Orchestra, taught by professors Jorma Panula and Eri Klas. She also served as Concertmistress of the Sibelius Academy Symphony Orchestra on various occasions as well as played the 1st violin in the Finnish National Opera Orchestra for three years, before embarking on a full-time solo career.\n\nIn addition to the Sibelius Academy, Brava also studied privately with professor Mauricio Fuks in the USA as well as took part in numerous master classes in Finland, France, and Israel, including Shlomo Mintz's Keshet Eilon Violin Programme, studying with Shmuel Ashkenasi.\n\nLajos Garam, former leader of the Department of Soloists at the Sibelius Academy, has said that Brava \"is a sensitive artistic type and very skillful and experienced as a musician. Her playing is high-quality and full-blooded\". For conductor Atso Almila \"it was self-evident that she was going to be one of the most notable Finnish violinists.\" Violinist and pedagogue Päivyt Meller has stated that \"Linda is very multiply gifted. She has aberrantly lots of capability of expression, strength and artistry and her playing is technically on quite a high level\", while violinist and conductor Ari Angervo has said that Brava \"just wanted to learn to play as well as possible, to go as deep as possible into music. To my mind she has succeeded in that. Linda is top talented as a violinist.\" Furthermore, professor Mauricio Fuks has said that \"she has a talent for learning and absorbing new things very quickly — Linda is very talented and takes her playing seriously — I am very happy getting to work with a person this sweet. We have been working daily and her playing keeps improving all the time. I would describe Linda as a natural talent, who is at home with the violin.\"\n\nBrava has performed chamber music all around Europe, Asia, and the USA, working with various pianists, including Timo Koskinen, Folke Gräsbeck, Laura Mikkola, Carina E. Nilsson, Linn Hendry, and John Lenehan. Brava has also made many solo orchestral appearances. In addition to Finnish and Swedish city orchestras, she has played with La Scala Opera Orchestra and toured with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. \"She captivated the audience at the Ulriksdal Palace park with passion – The harmonics, the left- and right-hand pizzicato, the ardour in tone, the double stops – it was there\", wrote \"Svenska Dagbladet\" on her performance of Maurice Ravel's \"Tzigane\" with the Stockholm Sinfonietta. Brava has also appeared as a soloist of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra. In addition to headlining music festivals with José Carreras and Kevin Kenner, Brava has also toured with Paul Potts and performed with Andrea Griminelli.\n\nBrava moved to Sweden in 2002 and her first major concert tours in the country occurred a few years later. The outcome was successful as critics raved her talent and she managed to break into the Swedish music scene. \"She has been described as a super violinist with \"Playboy\" attraction. When Linda Lampenius takes the stage in light blue coverings it is completely without prima donna behaviour. With total stage presence and a bewitched violin she enchants the ears already from the start and there seems to be no end to the applause after the entrance performance\" wrote \"Dalarnas Tidningar\" while \"Göteborgs-Posten\" reported how Brava's \"music potpourri became a display in virtuoso violin playing\" and that \"she is undeniably a gifted musician with dazzling technique and a big amount of charm\". Brava has since participated in various concert tours and given concerts all around the country, performing among others with pianist Robert Wells, soprano Hannah Holgersson, and harpist Monica Ramos.\n\nIn addition to Sweden, Brava has continued performing internationally as well. Some of her special appearances have included performances for the NATO troops in Kosovo, the \"Rhapsody in Rock\" show at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and violin concerts in Astana, Kazakhstan, Irkutsk, Siberia, and the Cannes Film Festival in South of France. Brava also performs in corporate events on a regular basis, both in the Nordic countries and elsewhere, including a Ferrari and Maserati event in Moscow.\n\nIn 2010, Brava performed in the last concert of the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra's Summer Concert Series, playing works by Turlough Carolan, Michael William Balfe, and Michael McGlynn. She also appeared as a soloist of the Royal Swedish Chamber Orchestra in the grand finale concert of the 40th Annual Royal Palace Music Festival at the Royal Palace of Stockholm. In 2011, Brava toured as a soloist of the Schoenbrunn Palace Orchestra Vienna, co-headlining concerts in many of the major concert halls in the Nordic countries such as Finlandia Hall and Stockholm Concert Hall.\n\nWith her 1781 Gagliano violin, Brava has performed for many heads of state and royals, including the President of Finland, Prince of Monaco, and the Royal Family of Sweden. Brava has also played for various European and American politicians, including the United States Secretary of Defense William Perry. Brava has also performed for some of the Nobel Prize laureates on the Arctic Circle during festivities marking the 300th anniversary of scientist Carl Linnaeus' birth.\n\nIn order to help contribute funds for different charities, Brava has performed in numerous benefit concerts over the years. She has played at the 150th Anniversary Gala Concert of the Queen Silvia Children's Hospital in Sweden, for several children's hospitals in Finland, and on behalf of Unicef during the \"White Turf\" celebrations on the frozen Lake St. Moritz in Switzerland.

Brava is also a regular performer in Princess Sofia of Sweden's benefit events that assist underprivileged children in South Africa.\n\nPop and rock music\n\nKnown as a classical violinist, Brava was asked to appear on a Finnish television talk show and play a pop version of Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in fall 1996. Brava agreed and was offered a recording contract for pop music with a Finnish record label soon after.\n\nBrava's debut album, \"Linda Lampenius\", was released only in Finland, but immediately got international attention as well. After seeing a television profile made of her on British TV and tracking down her musical pedigree, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber invited Brava to take the violin lead in his exclusive rock symphony with Jim Steinman, \"Metal Philharmonic\", that was showcased at the 23rd Sydmonton Festival in Hampshire. The collaboration between Brava and Lloyd Webber meant a significant media exposure for her, including the cover story of \"The Sunday Times\" Culture supplement. Thereafter, Brava became known as the \"Bach Babe\" in the United Kingdom tabloids, and \"The Sun\" ran a front-page article on her, rating her above Vanessa-Mae with a headline \"Vanessa Mae, Linda does\".\n\nBrava made some pop rock appearances around Europe and the USA, including televised performances at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. While living in England, Brava studied, played, and recorded pop rock music with Dave Gregory (the lead guitarist for XTC), Chris Blackwell (drummer for Robert Plant), and Charlie Jones (bass player for Robert Plant and Jimmy Page), under the guidance of Craig Leon (producer for The Ramones and Blondie), in addition to having her own pop rock band \"Violators\". She also worked with Ofra Haza, with whom she recorded at Abbey Road Studios. Their song \"Tarab\" is the last recording of Haza, who died soon after.\n\nIn 2003, Brava starred in her own variety show \"Fantastix\" in a Stockholm theatre. The show included her violin playing, acting, dancing, and fire eating. Brava has since performed among others with singers Sofia Källgren, Pernilla Wahlgren, and LaGaylia Frazier, in addition to playing with rock and heavy metal bands like Takida and Mustasch. In 2008, Brava was one of the leading soloists of the 10th anniversary tour of the \"Rhapsody in Rock\" spectacle, which has been staged all around the world, and she was titled as the best artist of the tour, \"who awes as usual\", by \"Aftonbladet\", the biggest daily newspaper in Scandinavia.\n\nOver the years, Brava has also performed in various sports events.

Although the album was released only in Finland, Brava's single \"Violator\"/\"Toccata and Fugue\" got international attention: \"Pammi lookalike's great on her Bach\" stated the \"Daily Mirror\" and the \"Daily Record\" wrote that \"just when interest in violin music was toning down along comes Linda Lampenius — the fiddling Finn has taken a major bow — she is already a sensation with her version of Bach's Toccata and Fugue\". Also \"The Sunday Times\" reported how Brava \"has enjoyed huge success in Scandinavia with an up-tempo version of Bach's Toccata and Fugue\". Brava has performed material from the album in Finland and abroad, including Sporting Club in Monaco and televised performances at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles.\n\nLinda Brava\n\nBrava was offered a recording contract by EMI in 1997, and she worked under the EMI Classics label from 1998 to 2002. In 1998, Brava started recording her first classical album with John Lenehan at Abbey Road Studios in London, and the \"Linda Brava\" album was released worldwide in 1999, the track listing including Edvard Grieg's \"Violin Sonata No. 3 in C minor\" as well as lyrical violin miniatures by Edward Elgar, Gabriel Fauré, Jean Sibelius, Johann Sebastian Bach-Charles Gounod, Jules Massenet, Niccolò Paganini, and Fritz Kreisler. The album peaked at number 14 on the UK Classical Chart, and Brava became the biggest selling Finnish classical artist at the time.\n\n\"Gramophone\" described the album as \"a delightful recital – played with such warmth, and an eloquent simplicity of line, that the ear is instantly beguiled – a welcome collection\". \"Classic FM Magazine\" dedicated its cover story for \"Linda Brava, Finland's violin sensation\", and wrote that she plays \"with a pleasant, honeyed tone – making the most of her golden-voiced 1781 Galliano violin – and an unaffected grace that will surely win her many friends\". Composer and critic Paul Turok of \"Turok's Choice\" thought \"the high point of her fine recital disc with pianist John Lenehan is a strong reading of Grieg's Sonata\" while the \"Evening Standard\" wrote \"her best playing comes in the three short pieces by her countryman Sibelius: the skittish Rondino extracts her quickest fingerwork, the Humoreske Op.87 No.1 wins her most tortured expression and the Romance Op.78 No.2 sings under her confident touch\". Classic FM UK played music from the album on a daily basis for several weeks, and it was also noted positively by BBC Radio 3 and ABC Classic FM Australia.\n\nWith the album release, Brava appeared in various newspapers, magazines and TV and radio shows all around Europe and the Far East, being featured on a major poster on the back of a red double-decker bus driving on Oxford Street in London as well. Brava's music video for \"Ave Maria\" was seen on Classic FM TV, and it was also featured in the first edition of \"Classic FM [2003]\" DVD. Nowadays, Brava's music video can be seen on C Music TV, which included the video in its \"August Highlights 2010\".\n\nNordic Light\n\nBrava's third album \"Nordic Light\" was released in the Nordic countries in 2005 and re-released in Sweden in 2008, peaking at number 12 on the Swedish Top Album Chart. The album is a collection of folk melodies from Finland and Sweden, also including a medley from the musical \"Kristina från Duvemåla\" by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA. Brava was inspired to record the album after her two 25-city concert tours in Sweden together with Kalle Moraeus, a former violinist of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and one of the most sought-after folk musicians in the country. On the critically acclaimed album, Brava is accompanied by members of Benny Anderssons Orkester while Anders Ekborg sings on two tracks.\n\nAngels\n\nBrava's latest album \"Angels\" is a collection of Christmas carols from Finland, Sweden, Germany, France, England, and the United States, arranged for solo violin, string quartet, harp, and female choir, in addition to numerous guest artists such as guitarist Ulf Wakenius, trombonist Nils Landgren, and soprano Sofia Källgren.\n\nThe album peaked at number 3 on the Swedish Classical Album Chart, and includes classics like \"Angels We Have Heard on High\", \"Away in a Manger\", \"Ding Dong Merrily on High\", \"O Holy Night\", \"Panis angelicus\", and \"Silent Night\". \"Angels\" is the first album released through Brava's own record label Linda Lampenius Productions, although, the album is distributed by Naxos Records. It is also Brava's first Christmas release.\n\nThe album was produced by Brava herself and Lars Nilsson, who also produced Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Prince Daniel's wedding album. The arrangers include Swedish composers Paula af Malmborg, Olov Helge, and Dan Evmark as well as a Norwegian composer Tormod Tvete Vik. The featured string quartet is Hvila from the Gothenburg Symphony, and the female choir is Leif Strands Damkör from Gothenburg as well. The harpist Delphine Constantin is from France.\n\nReleased in Finland and Sweden, \"Angels\" got warm reviews in various publications. \"Göteborgs-Posten\" wrote that Brava is \"a good soloist\", who \"approaches her music with devotion\", and the critic was especially \"fascinated by the strong, melancholic Finnish Christmas song 'Sylvian joululaulu' ('Sylvia's Christmas Song')\". \"Hallands Nyheter\" positively declared that \"musically, the outcome sounds more like a concert recording\", and \"Västerbottens-Kuriren\" described the album as \"beautiful, caressing and enjoyable, soothing and pleasant\", while \"Hufvudstadsbladet\" stated that Brava is \"a divinely gifted violinist\" and \"the performances are high-class\". Furthermore, \"Rondo-Classica\", the biggest classical music magazine in the Nordic countries, thought the album is Brava's \"best release so far – She plays convincingly. The tone of her Gagliano violin has become more beautiful, and her pretty straightforward phrasing is completed well by the clang of the harp and the angelic voices of the female choir.\" Brava promoted the album in Finland and Sweden with numerous television and radio appearances, newspaper and magazine articles, and promotional performances.\n\nModelling\n\nBrava attended a modelling school and came 2nd in a major modelling competition in Finland in 1988, appearing in a few fashion shows and a televised coffee commercial. She was also asked to participate in Miss Finland beauty pageants several times, but refused, because she wanted to concentrate on her playing.\n\nIn 1996, both Björn Borg and Panos Emporio offered Brava a modelling contract, and she became the spokesperson for the Björn Borg fashion label, appearing in advertisements, fashion shows, and other promotional events in Finland, Sweden, and England from 1996 through 1999. Especially the Björn Borg fashion shows, some of which were also televised, became popular, and Brava drew international media attention as she was playing the violin while modelling swimsuits on catwalks. The shows became so popular that when Brava performed in the NK Stockholm for the first time, there was a queue outside and some people were unable to see the show. Brava's televised performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London in the middle of the 1st ATP Masters tournament between Björn Borg and John McEnroe made also headlines, and the picture of her in a tiny black, figure-hugging lycra outfit and red faux fur moon boots was prominently featured in the papers the following days.\n\nThe Swiss watch manufacturer Maurice Lacroix engaged Brava to promote their \"Calypso\" range of watches in England in 2000.

{"id": "2105295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105295", "title": "British Rail Class 320", "text": "British Rail Class 320\n\nThe British Rail Class 320 is an alternating current (AC) electric multiple-unit (EMU) train found on the Strathclyde rail network in Central Scotland. They are mainly used on the North Clyde Line and the Argyle Line, but they can also be seen on Glasgow Central to Lanark services as well as Cathcart Circle services along with Class 318s, Class 380s, and Class 385s.\n\nThe Class 320 is effectively a three-car derivative of the Class 321 units found in and around London and Yorkshire. Built in 1990 by British Rail Engineering Limited's Holgate Road carriage works, 22 three-car sets were ordered by SPT to supersede the ageing Class 303 and Class 311 stock which were by then 30 years old. The trains were built against lot numbers 31060–2, which were issued on 6 January 1989 and completed on 31 October 1990.\n\nThe units run on 25 kV AC overhead line supply via a Brecknell Willis high speed pantograph, using four Brush TM2141B traction motors. With much shorter passenger journeys in mind, the Class 320 units originally lacked the toilets of the Class 321 units and also began life with a lower speed capability () due to the much closer spacing of stations on the North Clyde route. The lower design speed meant that yaw dampers could be omitted from this class but during 2010, yaw dampers were fitted across the class allowing them to travel at . This meant that the units could be used on the sections of the Argyle Line route shared with the West Coast Main Line (and in theory, the Airdrie-Bathgate extension of the North Clyde Line and beyond – although this is at the moment prevented by the lack of external CCTV cameras on the units (as fitted to Class 334 and 380) for driver-only operation (DOO) and there is currently no station DOO equipment east of Airdrie), and also allows full-speed running in multiple with Class 318 stock, which has had 90 mph capability from the outset. The interior decor includes paintings of various landmarks and famous sights along the various SPT rail routes on the car ends.\n\nThe Class 320 units are fitted with GSM-R cab radios and took part in the GSM-R trial in the Strathclyde area.\n\nThe units were originally intended to operate on the Argyle Line but, mainly because the platform monitors on the Argyle Line stations did not line up with the driver cabs, the units had always been restricted to the North Clyde route, although they were occasionally used for VIP trips from the high-level platforms of Glasgow Central when they were the newest EMU stock in the SPT fleet. The problem was resolved in 2011 and the units began entering service to replace the final Class 334 units from the Argyle Line. From December 2016, Class 320s have started to operate on the Cathcart/Newton lines from Glasgow Central High Level replacing some 314s which are cascading to Inverclyde.\n\nLike all SPT rolling stock of the period, the Class 320s were painted in orange/black livery until 1997, when the carmine/cream livery was progressively phased in. Between 2002 and 2004, the Class 320 fleet were given a major interior refurbishment, with new seat covers, floor coverings, improved interior saloon lighting diffusers and electronic and audible destination information systems installed. The units were given a revised SPT carmine and cream livery upon its refurbishment, the most noticeable being the passenger doors being all cream.\n\nIn September 2008 the Scottish Government's agency Transport Scotland announced that all \"ScotRail\" trains would be eventually repainted in a new, blue livery with white Saltire markings on the carriage ends. Relivery of the fleet began in February 2011 when the units are taken for their refurbishment. All Class 320 units are now in saltire livery.\n\nIn 2011, Class 320s started to be used in the Argyle Line alongside the Class 318s, as well as operating on the North Clyde Line alongside the Class 334s. Although possible, as of 2019 they are not diagrammed to operate east of Airdrie.\n\nAll Class 320s were refurbished by Wabtec Doncaster between February 2011 and October 2013. The refurbishment work included:\n\nThe first unit to be completed is 320314, which headed south to Wabtec Doncaster on 14 February 2011, returning on 6 June 2011. The final unit to be sent for refurbishment was 320310, headed south on 30 August 2013. It is also the last Class 320 unit to retain the SPT branding in the fleet. The unit returned on 4 October 2013, completing the refurbishment programme of the Class 320 units.\n\nThere is to be another refurbishment programme on the Class 320, this time focusing more on the interiors, replacing the vinyl flooring with new vinyl flooring, recovering the seat covers into Saltire blue moquette trim, repainting the grab rails & seat top hand grips yellow, fitting power sockets and LED interior saloon lighting diffusers. The refurbishment programme commences in October 2017 and will be completed in 2019. This work will bring the Class 320/3 EMU fleet up to the same level of standard as the seven Class 320/4 and will also complement the refurbished Class 318 EMU trains.\n\nA fleet of seven former London Midland Class 321/4 units were converted to Class 320/4 at Doncaster Wabtec works before being transferred to Scotrail between July 2015 and October 2016. The conversion included the removal of the TSOL trailer vehicle, becoming a 3-car set. The first three converted units, 320411, 320412 and 320416, entered service in March 2016, initially retaining London Midland livery.\n\nThe first fully refurbished unit, 320415, entered service on 15 August 2016. The unit was painted in Scotrail Saltire livery, and had received a full internal refurbishment, including an internal repaint, new floor vinyl and new blue 'saltire' seat coverings, and fitting of a large accessible toilet. Subsequent converted units would be fully refurbished and the initial three units were later returned to Doncaster Wabtec works for refurbishment. The conversion and refurbishment of all 7 Class 320/4 units was completed in January 2017.\n\nIn November 2017, ScotRail received further five Class 321/4 units which were converted to Class 320/4 by Wabtec Rail Scotland in Kilmarnock from November 2017, with entry in to service planned to begin from summer 2018.\n\nThe first of the five additional units, 320404, was released from Wabtec Rail Scotland and moved to Glasgow Shields Road TMD on 8 August 2018.\n\nAll Class 320 units have since been denamed following the refurbishment between 2011 and 2013.\n\n"}

It builds a C-shaped nest of feathers, saliva and plant material on the inside of the dead leaf of a Moriche Palm. Three white eggs are laid in the depression of the C, and incubated for 21 days to hatching.\n\nNeotropical palm swift is a slender, narrow-winged species, 13.2 cm long, with a long forked tail, and weighs 11 g. The call is a buzzed \"djjjjjj\", like an insect. The nominate western form \"T. s. squamata\" has black-brown upperparts with a slight greenish gloss. The underparts are a paler brown with a white throat and central underbody. The eastern race \"T. s. semota\" of Trinidad, the Guianas and central and eastern Brazil is much darker, almost steel-black above and darker brown below. Juveniles are very similar, but have buff fringes to the upperparts and head in fresh plumage.\n\nDespite its shape and association with palms, it is in a different genus to the Asian and African palm swifts.\n\nNeotropical palm swift feeds in low flight on flying insects. It normally stays at less than 10 m above the ground. It normally occurs in small groups of up to 30 birds.\n\n\n"}

Several of her books were dedicated to her husband W. Burlie Brown, who was a history professor at Tulane University. The couple had two children. In addition to writing, she worked as a teacher and a welfare visitor in Louisiana. In 1959, she was nominated for the Hugo Award for best new author, but her career was cut short when she died of lymphoma at the age of 41 in 1967. The fourth \"Nebula Award Anthology\" contains an obituary written by Daniel F. Galouye, and Anne McCaffrey dedicated her 1970 anthology \"Alchemy & Academe\" to Brown, along with several other people. Brown and McCaffrey had met at a Milford Writer's Workshop.\n\nBrown's works were mainly written in the late 1950s to the mid-1960s and generally were favorably received by critics and readers. Her main novels are \"Sibyl Sue Blue\" a.k.a. \"Galactic Sibyl Sue Blue\", and its sequel, \"The Waters of Centaurus\", which chronicle the life of Sybil Sue Blue, a female detective. \"The Waters of Centaurus\" was published after her death, and was copyrighted by her husband in 1970. She also collaborated on the novel \"Earthblood\" (1966) with Keith Laumer.\n\nHer short stories appeared in \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Amazing Stories, Fantastic Universe\" and elsewhere.

{"id": "2105335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105335", "title": "Eastern equine encephalitis", "text": "Eastern equine encephalitis\n\nEastern equine encephalitis (EEE), commonly called Triple E or sleeping sickness (not to be confused with African trypanosomiasis), is a disease caused by a zoonotic mosquito vectored \"Togavirus\" that is present in North, Central, and South America, and the Caribbean. EEE was first recognized in Massachusetts, United States, in 1831, when 75 horses died mysteriously of viral encephalitis.\nEpizootics in horses have continued to occur regularly in the United States. It can also be identified in donkeys and zebras. Due to the rarity of the disease, its occurrence can cause economic impact in relation to the loss of horses and poultry. EEE is found today in the eastern part of the United States and is often associated with coastal plains. It can most commonly be found in East Coast and Gulf Coast states. In Florida, about one to two human cases are reported a year, although over 60 cases of equine encephalitis are reported. In years in which conditions are favorable for the disease, the number of equine cases is over 200. Diagnosing equine encephalitis is challenging because many of the symptoms are shared with other illnesses and patients can be asymptomatic. Confirmations may require a sample of cerebral spinal fluid or brain tissue, although CT scans and MRI scans are used to detect encephalitis. This could be an indication that the need to test for EEE is necessary. If a biopsy of the cerebral spinal fluid is taken, it is sent to a specialized laboratory for testing.\n\nEastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is closely related to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus.\n\nThe virus can progress either systematically or encephalitically, depending on the person's age. Encephalitic disease involves swelling of the brain and can be asymptomatic, while the systemic illness occurs very abruptly. Those with the systemic illness usually recover within 1–2 weeks. While the encephalitis is more common among infants, in adults and children, it usually manifests after experiencing the systemic illness. Symptoms include high fever, muscle pain, altered mental status, headache, meningeal irritation, photophobia, and seizures, which occur 3–10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. Due to the virus's effect on the brain, patients who survive can be left with mental and physical impairments, such as personality disorders, paralysis, seizures, and intellectual impairment.\n\nThe causative agent, later identified as a togavirus, was first isolated from infected horse brains in 1933. In 1938, the first confirmed human cases were identified when 30 children died of encephalitis in the Northeastern United States. These cases coincided with outbreaks in horses in the same regions. The fatality rate in humans is 33%, and currently no cure is known for human infections. This virus has four variations in the types in lineage. The most common to the human disease is group 1, which is considered to be endemic in North America and the Caribbean, while the other three lineages, groups IIA, IIB, and III, are typically found in Central and South America, causing equine illness.\n\nThese two clades may actually be distinct viruses. The North American strains appear to be monotypic with a mutation rate of 2.7 × 10 substitutions/site/year (s/s/y). It appears to have diverged from the other strains 922 to 4,856 years ago. The other strains are divided into two main clades and a third smaller one. The two main clades diverged between 577 and 2,927 years ago. The mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be 1.2 × 10 s/s/y.\n\nEEEV is capable of infecting a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The virus is maintained in nature through a bird—mosquito cycle. Two mosquito species are primarily involved in this portion of the cycle; they are \"Culiseta melanura\" and \"\". These mosquitoes feed on the blood of birds. The frequency of the virus found in nature increases throughout the summer as more birds and more mosquitoes become infected.\n\nTransmission of EEEV to mammals (including humans) occurs via other mosquito species, which feed on the blood of both birds and mammals. These other mosquitoes are referred to as \"bridge vectors\" because they carry the virus from the avian hosts to other types of hosts, particularly mammals. The bridge vectors include \"Aedes taeniorhynchus\"\", Aedes vexans\", \"Coquillettidia perturbans\", \"Ochlerotatus canadensis\", and \"Ochlerotatus sollicitans\". \"Ochlerotatus canadensis\" also frequently bites turtles.\n\nHumans, horses, and most other infected mammals do not circulate enough viruses in their blood to infect additional mosquitoes. Some cases of EEE have been contracted through laboratory exposures or from exposure of the eyes, lungs, or skin wounds to brain or spinal cord matter from infected animals.\n\nThe disease can be prevented in horses with the use of vaccinations, which are usually given with vaccinations for other diseases, most commonly western equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and tetanus. Most vaccinations for EEE consist of the killed virus. For humans, no vaccine for EEE is available; prevention involves reducing the risk of exposure. Using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and reducing the amount of standing water is the best means for prevention.\n\nNo cure for EEE has been found. Treatment consists of corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, and supportive measures (treating symptoms) such as intravenous fluids, tracheal intubation, and antipyretics. About 4% of humans known to be infected develop symptoms, with a total of about six cases per year in the US. A third of these cases die, and many survivors suffer permanent brain damage.\n\nSeveral states in the Northeast U.S. have had increased virus activity since 2004. Between 2004 and 2006, at least ten human cases of EEE were reported in Massachusetts. In 2006, about in southeastern Massachusetts were treated with mosquito adulticides to reduce the risk of humans contracting EEE. Several human cases were reported in New Hampshire, as well.\n\nOn 19 July 2012, the virus was identified in a mosquito of the species \"Coquillettidia perturbans\" in Nickerson State Park on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On 28 July 2012, the virus was found in mosquitos in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\n\n, a notable uptick in cases erupted in New England and Michigan, prompting some health departments to declare an outbreak. , five people died in Michigan, three people died in Connecticut, one person died in Rhode Island, one person died in Alabama, one person died in Indiana, and three people died in Massachusetts. The virus was also found in goats, in turkeys, in deer, and in horses.\n\nIn October 2007, a citizen of Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland became the first European victim of this disease. The man had visited New Hampshire during the summer of 2007, on a fishing vacation, and was diagnosed as having EEE on 13 September 2007. He fell ill with the disease on 31 August 2007, just one day after flying home, and later fell into a coma. He later awoke from the coma with severe brain injuries.\n\nEEEV was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological-weapons program with the ratification of the Biological Weapons Convention.\n\nAfter inoculation by the vector, the virus travels via lymphatics to lymph nodes, and replicates in macrophages and neutrophils, resulting in lymphopenia, leukopenia, and fever. Subsequent replication occurs in other organs, leading to viremia. Symptoms in horses occur 1–3 weeks after infection, and begin with a fever that may reach as high as 106 °F (41 °C). The fever usually lasts for 24–48 hours.\n\nNervous signs appear during the fever that include sensitivity to sound, periods of excitement, and restlessness. Brain lesions appear, causing drowsiness, drooping ears, circling, aimless wandering, head pressing, inability to swallow, and abnormal gait. Paralysis follows, causing the horse to have difficulty raising its head. The horse usually suffers complete paralysis and death 2–4 days after symptoms appear. Mortality rates among horses with the eastern strain range from 70 to 90%.\n\n\n"}

The Department of National Defence (DND) was delegated authority to administer and control the NWA. The Base Commander is responsible for operations, management, and permitting in the SNWA. \n\nCFB Suffield itself was created in 1971 when control of the Suffield Block was transferred from the Defence Research Establishment Suffield as part of the reorganization to support the mechanized training activities of the British Army Training Unit Suffield on the northern two-thirds of the area. The 2960 km² area of the Suffield Block was expropriated by the Province of Alberta during the Second World War on behalf of the Canadian Federal Government. The land was leased to the Federal Government for ninety-nine years at a cost of one dollar per year to support the operation of the Experimental Station Suffield. Upon the termination of the Second World War, ownership of the British Block (or Suffield Block) was transferred from the province to the federal government in exchange for a large number of army and air camps and building from the Dominion Government (War Assets Corporation).\n\nThe portion of the Suffield Block that is now the National Wildlife Area was zoned for environmental protection and included three parts: the Middle Sand Hills, the Mixed Grass Prairie zone, the South Saskatchewan River zone. \n\nIn 1974 Canada and Alberta signed a surface access agreement for the purpose of developing petroleum reserves on CFB Suffield. Since that time there have been over 14,000 oil and gas wells drilled at CFB Suffield. Most of this activity was conducted by the Alberta Energy Company (AEC), which is now EnCana Corporation. The company has drilled 1,163 natural gas wells within the SNWA, all prior to the creation of the SNWA. EnCana has proposed an additional drilling of about 1,275 more natural gas wells over three years. This shallow-gas infill drilling program was the subject of an environmental assessment. In 2012, the proposed project was rejected, as \"the significant adverse environmental effects that the Project is likely to cause are not justified.\"\n\n"}

After studying various world music traditions at CalArts, he began creating his own percussion sounds out of industrial materials for a variety of record labels. He is regarded as a pioneer of industrial music. \n\nZ'EV was a strong presence in the New York City downtown music scene in the 1980s and 1990s, performing with Elliott Sharp, Glenn Branca, and doing solo performances at The Kitchen, The Knitting Factory, Danceteria, and other venues where experimental music flourished.\n\nIn 1983, critic Roy Sablosky wrote: \"Z'EV doesn't just break the rules, he changes them.\" Journalist Louis Morra wrote in 1983: \"Z'EV is a consummate example of contemporary performance art, as well as modern composition and theater.\" and, \"Z'EV realizes many of modernist art's ultimate goals: primitivism, improvisation, multi-media/conjunction of art forms, the artist as direct creator.\"\n\nHis work with text and sound was influenced by Kabbalah, as well as African, Afro-Caribbean and Indonesian music and culture. He studied Ewe music, Balinese gamelan, and Indian tala.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1965, he studied drumming with Arnie Frank, then Chuck Flores and then Art Anton at Drum City in Van Nuys, California.\n\nIn 1963, he abandoned Judaism and began his lifelong relationship with world religions and esoteric systems.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1969, he performed in a jazz rock band with Carl Stone and James Stewart. After auditioning for Frank Zappa's Bizarre Records, the band ceased activities and both he and Stone began attending the California Institute of the Arts.\n\nAfter studying at CalArts from 1969 to 1970, he began producing works using the name S. Weisser, primarily concentrating on visual and sound poetries.\n\nIn 1975, he was included in the \"Second Generation\" show at the Museum of Conceptual Art in San Francisco. He also became a member of Cellar-M, a musical project of Naut Humon. He would continue to work with Humon on various projects, such as Rhythm & Noise, until 1988.\n\nIn 1976 he moved from Los Angeles to the Bay Area. A primary reason for this move was his association with the San Francisco alternative exhibition space La Mamelle, run by Carl Loeffler and Nancy Evans.\n\nIn 1977, he presented his first solo percussion performance at La Mamelle under the project title 'Sound of Wind and Limb'.\n\nIn 1978 he began developing an idiosyncratic performance technique utilizing self-developed instruments formed from industrial materials such as stainless steel, titanium, and PVC plastics. Initially these instruments were assemblages of these materials, used with a movement-based performance style that was a form of marionette, although with the performer visible. He has since come to refer to this performance mode as 'wild-style', a term originally related to graffiti. At this time, he first began to perform outside of the fine art context, initially at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco. In the fall of 1978, he began performing under the name Z'EV, which comes from the Hebrew name his parents gave him at birth (Sh'aul Z'ev bn Yakov bn Moshe bn Sha'ul).\n\nIn November and December 1980, Z'EV opened a series of UK and European concerts in the first headlining tour of the British group Bauhaus. On that tour, and his first solo tour of Europe immediately afterwards, Z'EV introduced intense metal based percussion musics to the UK and Europe. Critic Jason Pettigrew (current editor-in-chief of \"Alternative Press\" magazine) attests to Z'EV's pioneering use of metal found object as percussion, writing: \"Consider your music collection. Neubauten? Test Department? Z'EV's been there first.' \n\nIn 1981, 'Shake Rattle & Roll', a VHS video documenting his first wild-style performance on the East coast (produced by video artist Jon Child), was released by Fetish Records in the UK and was the first 'music' / art video to be commercially released. In 1982 he worked with Glenn Branca for Brancas Symphony No. 2 in which Z'EV had a solo segment swinging with metal can overhead, and rattling chains and sheets of steel. After 1984, he concentrated on performing in a more traditional mallet-percussion style, albeit with highly idiosyncratic and \"extended\" mallet percussion techniques and his self-made or adapted instruments. Both performance modes, (wild-style and mallet percussion), have been described as cacophonous when considered in traditional Western musical terms, because of the dense elemental acoustic phenomena Z'EV's instruments produce. In point of fact, Z'EV doesn't actually consider the results as \"music\" \"per se\", but more as orchestrations of highly rhythmic acoustic phenomena.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1990 ,he was a Guest Teacher in Composition and Improvisation at the Theater School for New Dance Development in Amsterdam. With dancer Ria Higler, he mentored a group through their entire four-year course of study.\n\nIn 1990, he began working with Amsterdam house musician, DJ Dano. Their work, also in conjunction with Austrian media artist Konrad Becker, was instrumental in the emergence of the genres known as gabber and hardcore. His recordings have been released by C.I.P., Cold Spring, Die Stadt, Soleilmoon, Tzadik Records, Subterranean and Touch.\n\nZ'EV was critically injured in the 2016 Cimarron train derailment which took place near Dodge City, Kansas on March 14, 2016. After this incident, he continued to have health problems, but continued working. He lived for three months in the guest room of his friend Boyd Rice in Southern California. Afterwards, Z'EV traveled to Europe and was an artist in residence at the Porto-based sound lab Sonoscopia, where he built a number of percussion instruments. \n\nHe died on December 16, 2017 in Chicago from pulmonary failure.\n\n\n"}
