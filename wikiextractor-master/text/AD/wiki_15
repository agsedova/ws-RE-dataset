The five-year curriculum aims at training engineers who possess humane qualities and are well versed in the primary areas of science and engineering. The school accommodates 1,400 students in engineering.\n\nThe education is divided into two parts:\n\nSome special sections are available:\n\n\nThe university is located on a campus called \"Beaulieu\" in the east of Rennes.\n\nThe five year academic curriculum starts with a foundation course (preparatory cycle) where students focus on fundamental sciences (maths, physics, chemistry, mechanics and computer sciences) and then progressively concentrate on specialized areas in science and technology. This generalist preparatory cycle ensures that all INSA engineers acquire a solid background in terms of skills and competence, thus allowing them to reorient their career independently of their initial specialization. The first cycle is the highly selective part of the studies. During the first year the examinations are very hard to test if students are able to continue with their engineering studies.\n\n\nThe second cycle is completed in 3 years which offers 7 different engineering specialties.\n\nThe 17-hectare campus includes:\nhardware and software resources \n\nWith a 900-strong membership, the AEIR offers students a wide range of sports, leisure and cultural activities \nThe AS offers students the opportunity to partake in organised sports events and other sporting activities of a more or less competitive nature.\nStudents get involved in the business world.\nTheir aim is to take part in the worldwide Formula Student challenge and design, conceive and build a single-seat racing car.\nFSO is an association which gets students in touch with companies based in the West of France. \nThe EAI carries out numerous aid projects in developing countries (construction of schools, etc.). \nA gateway to participating in the humanitarian \"4L Trophy\" for 4L Citroën cars. Teams carry aid parcels destined for people in need in Africa. \n\nWEIPA is the freshers’ welcoming week. As its name implies, it is not a question of ragging the newcomers, but of getting to know the 1st year students in a good-humoured festive atmosphere.\nWEI is also a welcoming week but intended for freshmen entering directly in the 3rd year, part of the studies known as the engineering studies. The first two years being a preparatory time.\nFestival de l'oeil glauque (English: Festival of the squalid eye) is a role playing convention running each year. Board games and roleplaying games are available to players.\nThis recruitment fair is an essential opportunity for meetings between students and industry (60 companies and 2500 students). \nStudents look their smartest for the grandest of evenings that is Gala Night. Entertainment is provided by live bands and a variety of stage acts with refreshments available in the theme-bar hall. \nA LAN Party where more than 400 players gathers around several competitive games. The event also have a public part, where visitors can participate in retrogaming, watch streams and enjoy the show.\nA multicultural festival based on the many interpretations of the word “sens”. This festival offers a rich and varied programme with the objective of promoting freedom of artistic expression. \nOldest French student festival and the 2nd largest music festival in Rennes with more than 30 000 visitors each year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202646", "title": "Lou Christie", "text": "Lou Christie\n\nLugee Alfredo Giovanni Sacco (born February 19, 1943), known professionally as Lou Christie, is an American singer-songwriter best known for several pop hits in the 1960s, including his 1966 \"Lightnin' Strikes\".\n\nChristie was born Lugee Alfredo Giovanni Sacco on February 19, 1943, in Glenwillard, Pennsylvania, and grew up in suburban Pittsburgh. While attending Moon Area High School, he studied music and voice, served as student conductor of the choir and sang solos at holiday concerts. His teacher Frank Cummings wanted him to pursue a career in classical music, but Sacco wanted to cut a record to get on \"American Bandstand\". At age 15 he met and befriended Twyla Herbert, a classically trained musician 20 years his senior, who became his regular songwriting partner and wrote hundreds of songs with him over the next 30 years until her death in 2009. Sacco performed with several vocal groups and between 1959 and 1962 released several records on small Pittsburgh labels, achieving a local hit with \"The Jury\" by Lugee & The Lions (a group consisting of Sacco, Twyla Herbert's daughter Shirley, and two others) released on the Robbee label. After graduating from high school in 1961, Sacco traveled to New York and worked as a session vocalist.\n\nIn 1962, Sacco approached Nick Cenci with some demo tapes. Cenci liked his falsetto voice and suggested that he listen to the Four Seasons' recent hit \"Sherry\". Sacco and Herbert used the song as a model to write an original song called \"The Gypsy Cried\". One of the first things Cenci did was change the name Lugee Alfredo Giovanni Sacco to Lou Christie. Cenci told Sacco that there was only one Italian Great singer and that he had to change his name. Sacco's father liked the name change, because it had \"Christ\" in it. Cenci produced a recording of Sacco performing the song at Gateway Studio in Pittsburgh and initially released it on his own C & C label as a single in 1962, credited to \"Lou Christie\", the name Sacco used thereafter. The name \"Lou Christie\" was chosen by C & C Records, and \"The Gypsy Cried\" was credited to \"Lou Christie\" before they had consulted with Sacco about the name.\n\n\"The Gypsy Cried\" became a regional hit, selling 30,000 copies in Pittsburgh. Cenci contacted Morris Levy of Roulette Records, saying that he had a hit that needed national distribution. Levy released the single on Roulette, but initially nothing happened. Airplay slowly spread across the country, and \"The Gypsy Cried\" reached number 24 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, selling over one million copies. Cenci produced additional recording sessions for Christie in 1963 that generated two more hits. \"Two Faces Have I\", his second million-seller, reached number 6 on the chart in June 1963. Roulette released an album of 12 Lou Christie / Twyla Herbert songs in 1963 that reached 124 on the Billboard 200. With those hits, Christie joined Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars Tour.\n\nDuring this pre-Army phase of his career, the female vocalists featured on Christie's records were The Tammys, a trio from Pleasantville, Venango County, Pennsylvania. Christie and Herbert wrote the single \"Egyptian Shumba\" for the group, and although it was not a hit, it became a cult favorite in the Northern Soul scene in the early 1970s.\n\nChristie made numerous TV appearances on \"Where the Action Is\" (1965–1967), and also appeared on \"American Bandstand\" and \"The Buddy Deane Show\" (1962–1964) in Baltimore. He also sang with Del Shannon.\n\nChristie's third Roulette release, \"How Many Teardrops\" (written by Milan), stalled at #46 as Christie's career was temporarily derailed by his induction into the US Army. Christie did not have another charting single for two and a half years.\n\nChristie's career was quickly re-established after his discharge from the military when he signed with the MGM label. MGM reportedly disliked Christie's first single for the label, the Christie-Herbert song \"Lightnin' Strikes\". But Christie's new management promoted the record in California, and when it gained some traction (eventually reaching #2 on KHJ the last two weeks of 1965), MGM released it. \"Lightnin' Strikes\" reached #1 in the U.S. on Christie's 23rd birthday on February 19, 1966, entered the UK Top 20, becoming his first hit in that country, and peaked at #1 in Canada. The song featured his signature falsetto and included a female chorus (Bernadette Carroll, Denise Ferri, and Peggy Santiglia) shouting \"Stop!\" in counterpoint to the lead vocal:\n\nChristie's next release in the spring of 1966, \"Rhapsody in the Rain\", featured a melody inspired by Tchaikovsky's \"Romeo and Juliet\", telling of a teenager's memory of his sexual experience in the back seat of a car during a rainstorm as the windshield wipers made a rhythmic sound of \"together, together\". Later, after the romance ends, the wipers seem to say \"never, never\". Many radio stations banned the song after hearing the opening lyrics:\n\nMGM insisted on a re-recorded version that toned down the lyrical content. The third and fourth lines were changed to:\n\nDespite the edited version, many radio stations instead played two older songs re-released by other labels for which Christie had once recorded: \"Outside the Gates of Heaven\" (on Co & Ce Records) peaked at #45, while \"Big Time\" (on Colpix Records) hit #95. All three singles hit nationally within three weeks of one another, in March 1966, while \"Lightnin' Strikes\" was falling down the chart.\n\nAfter being dropped by MGM and an unfruitful stint with Columbia Records in the late 1960s, Christie teamed up with Buddah Records (a move prompted by his business manager Stan Polley) and bubblegum music record producer Tony Romeo and had a surprise Wall of Sound constant uptempo hit \"I'm Gonna Make You Mine\" (which Romeo wrote) in the early autumn of 1969. Helped by backing vocalist Linda Scott and by two promotional videos distinctly different from each other, the song peaked at #10 in the US, but climbed to #2 on the UK Singles Chart and thus became his biggest hit there.\n\nA follow up, \"She Sold Me Magic\", charted only in the UK, peaking at #25, and was later covered by Elton John. Conversely, \"Are You Getting Any Sunshine?\" only charted in America, where it reached #73.\n\nChristie spent the early 1970s between London and New York City. In 1971 he released a concept album called \"Paint America Love\", regarded by some as his best LP, and married former UK beauty queen Francesca Winfield in London. In 1974, Christie tried a new musical style, going country on his \"Beyond The Blue Horizon\" album. The title track, a remake of a hit song from 1930, written for the film \"Monte Carlo\", featured one of Christie's strongest non-falsetto vocal performances. The song missed the Country charts and only made #80 on the pop chart but managed #12 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song has been used in several film soundtracks, including 1988's \"Rain Man\". In the spring of 1978 Christie returned home to Pittsburgh to head the upstart record Label 2001 records, a branch of the 2001 and VIP nightclubs nationwide. While visiting local Friends at the Staircase Lounge, Christie heard a local group, Sweet Breeze, and loved the band's harmonies and music. Christie signed the band Sweet Breeze to their first recording contract and the band recorded a song written by Christie and Herbert called \"Summer in Malibu\" that was a regional hit for the band.\n\nChristie became active on the oldies circuit starting in the early 1980s, scoring a final US chart hit, credited as \"Summer '81 Medley\" by The Cantina Band (featuring Lou Christie), in 1981, performing a medley of Beach Boys classics.\n\nIn 1986, he recorded a duet with Lesley Gore of a medley of \"Since I Don't Have You\"/\"It's Only Make Believe\" for Manhattan Records, a division of EMI-America. The two singers, who each debuted on the Hot 100 in 1963, were touring together at the time, and the song was released only as a one-off single.\n\nIn 1997, Christie recorded his first all-new album since the 1970s, entitled \"Pledging My Love\" and produced by Alan Grossman & Jimm Mosher of Hit Music Studio in Spencer, North Carolina. \"Billboard\" labeled this new album \"Most Impressive Comeback\" album. Most of it was penned by Christie, presented in a contemporary manner, and included the songs \"What Happened to the Nights\", \"Techno Pop\" (a diatribe about the loss of communication in our lives), and \"I Sure Fell in Love\" and covers of the Critters' \"Mr. Dieingly Sad\" and Johnny Ace's title tune. Cub Koda said it was \"loaded with AOR hits\".\n\nIn 2004, Christie released his first concert album, \"Greatest Hits Live From The Bottom Line\", which featured studio recording \"Christmas In New York\" as a bonus track. In addition to the occasional new release, Christie remains a concert act on the oldies circuit in the US and UK. He has also hosted a series of programs on SiriusXM radio for the 1960s channel. In 2015, Christie released his first new recording in several years, entitled \"Drive In Dreams\", written by Gregory Scharpf, who is a former member of Sweet Breeze, the Pittsburgh-based band that Christie signed to their first recording contract. His next release was 2016's \"When You Were Young\", also penned by Scharpf.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2202678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202678", "title": "Georgie Pie", "text": "Georgie Pie\n\nGeorgie Pie was a fast food chain owned by retailer Progressive Enterprises specialising in meat pies that hoped to be \"New Zealand’s own homegrown alternative to the global fast-food industry giants such as McDonald's, Pizza Hut and Burger King\". The first Georgie Pie restaurant opened in 1977, and at its peak there were 32 restaurants across New Zealand. After running into financial difficulties, it was bought out by McDonald's in 1996, mainly for its restaurant locations. The last Georgie Pie store was closed in 1998.\n\nLarge pies at Georgie Pie came in a range of traditional (mince and cheese/steak and kidney) and international (Chinese/Mexican/Italian) flavours. In 2013, following frequent calls for the brand's return, McDonald's reintroduced Georgie Pie through its restaurants. However, there are no plans to open dedicated Georgie Pie stores.\n\nGeorgie Pie was the brainchild of Tom Ah Chee, who opened New Zealand's first supermarket (Foodtown Otahuhu, 1958). The first restaurant was opened in Kelston, Auckland in 1977. In 1994, plans were announced to open 25 new outlets per year, with a goal of 114 operating restaurants by the end of 1998. The chain came to prominence in the early 1990s with its $1, $2, $3, and $4 \"Funtastic Value\" menu. At its peak, the chain employed about 1,300 people. Georgie Pie was able to automate the food production process far more than chains which sold labour-intensive items such as burgers. Timing was a more difficult detail, for Georgie Pie, as it took 22 minutes to bake a pie versus a few minutes for typical fast food.\n\nFollowing the decision not to continue expansion of the brand, inquiries (by members of the Georgie Pie management team and other outside interested parties) into buying the brand were declined. Progressive Enterprises sold the food chain to McDonald's in 1996, who mainly bought the chain for its property, which included high-profile sites such as the corner of Great South Road and Green Lane East in Auckland. It also gave McDonald's a leg-up over arch-rival Burger King, who entered the New Zealand market in 1994 and were also actively interested in purchasing the Georgie Pie chain. At the conclusion of the deal, 17 outlets were converted into McDonald's restaurants. The other fifteen were sold, some to other fast food franchises or restaurants, one to a Bunnings Warehouse and one to a blood bank. The last Georgie Pie was located at Kepa Road in Auckland's Mission Bay where they ceased operations in 1998. The Foodtown/Countdown house brand \"Foodtown\" pies, which tasted nearly the same as Georgie Pies, were withdrawn in late 2004.\n\nDuring the course of its twenty-one years in business, Georgie Pie achieved a number of firsts in New Zealand: first drive-thru and first with breakfast; first 24-hour drive-thru; and the first domestic concept to seriously challenge the international fast food giants.\n\nNew Zealand Broadcasting School students Drig Chappells and Gareth Thorne started a Facebook group calling for the return of Georgie Pie. In September 2008, as part of a documentary known as \"Bring Back the George\", they temporarily converted a Christchurch bakery into the restaurant and sold pies made with the same recipe as the originals. All of their pies were sold in less than an hour, with people coming from as far as Auckland to get one. \"Bring Back Georgie Pie\" badges and T-shirts were available from a Wellington-based \"Kiwiana\" retailer until McDonald's identified intellectual property concerns and requested that their manufacture cease.\n\nA shop selling pies by the name \"GP Pies\" also opened in Kelston, West Auckland. McDonald's announced they were looking into possible copyright infringement of the name. They also announced they were looking into relaunching the Georgie Pie brand, not as a stand-alone shop, but possibly inside McDonald's outlets as a McCafe offering.\n\nIn May 2009, July 2011, and April 2012, media reports indicated that McDonald's New Zealand (the current trademark holder) were investigating a reopening of the brand. Nationwide radio station ZM even offered McDonald's $50,000 worth of free advertising if the stores were to reopen before the end of 2009.\n\nOccasionally, genuine Georgie Pies came onto the market, usually through New Zealand auction site TradeMe.\n\nOn 9 May 2013, McDonald's announced the return of Georgie Pie on a trial basis. From 5 June 2013, the original recipe Steak Mince 'n' Cheese pie (minus the monosodium glutamate) has been sold for $4.50 at the Queen Street and Greenlane McDonald's restaurants (the latter being a former Georgie Pie restaurant) in Auckland. The trial was quickly expanded to five more McDonald's restaurants in Auckland (including at Kelston, the location of the original Georgie Pie restaurant), three restaurants in Hamilton, and the Te Awamutu restaurant. The relaunch proved so popular that special queues and security staff were brought in to handle the crowds. At times, the lines went out of the restaurant and stretched across the car park. In July 2013, the trial was expanded to four more Auckland restaurants, as well as two restaurants in Palmerston North, and restaurants in Feilding and Bulls.\n\nOn 1 October 2013, McDonald's announced that the trial exceeded its expectations, and it would subsequently expand Georgie Pie to 107 of its 161 restaurants nationwide by the end of 2013 and introduce two new flavours of pie in early 2014. It was expected that by mid-2014 all McDonald's restaurants in New Zealand, except those which cannot accommodate the pie ovens, would be selling Georgie Pie.\n\nMcDonald's New Zealand had a 5.8 percent gain in sales in 2013, which has been largely attributed to the re-introduction of Georgie Pie.\n\nOn 5 March 2014, the Chicken 'n' Vegetable pie was re-introduced to the menu.\n\n"}

It is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia.\n\nThe roots of Neumann University began in 1855 when Bishop (later Saint) John Neumann approved the request of Anna Maria Boll Bachmann to start a religious community of Franciscan Sisters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Over the course of the next century, the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia grew to the point where they needed a college to assist in their mission of educating and caring for the people in south eastern Pennsylvania and beyond. Neumann University was founded as Our Lady of Angels College with 115 female students in 1965 by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia. The name was changed to Neumann College in 1980 in honor of Saint John Neumann, a former Bishop of Philadelphia.\n\nNeumann admitted its first male undergraduate students in 1980. The college was granted approval to offer its first doctoral program (the Doctorate in Physical Therapy) in 2004, and its second doctoral program (an Ed.D. in educational leadership) in 2005. Neumann achieved \"university status\" from the Pennsylvania Department of Education in 2009.\n\nNeumann University is made up of five academic divisions: the Division of Arts and Sciences, the Division of Business and Information Management, the Division of Nursing and Health Sciences, the Division of Education and Human Services, and the Division of Continuing Adult and Professional Studies.\n\nAs of the fall of 2017, the university has a total enrollment of 2,715; in fall 2016, the university had a total enrollment of 3,011. In academic year 2015-16, the university conferred 676 academic degrees: five associate degrees (1%); 524 bachelor's degrees (78%); 113 master's degrees (17%); and 34 doctorates (5%). Total tuition, fees, room, and board for a full-time undergraduate student in 2016-17 were $40,738. As of spring 2016, some 57% of undergraduates were Roman Catholic. Over the course of the last three years and building upon their large undergraduate program in Nursing, Neumann University has been expanding into the health care field by introducing new concentrations such as pre-Physical Therapy, pre-Occupational Therapy, pre-Athletic Training as well as introducing a new Health Sciences Major with tracks in exercise physiology and strength and conditioning. All of these new concentrations will be housed in Neumann's new Health Science Center which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2018. The Health Science Center will contain a state of the art undergraduate nursing teaching auditorium that seats close to 300 students.\n\nAbout 49% of undergraduate students are white, 31% are black, and 9% are Hispanic. Some 65% of undergraduates are female, and 35% are male. As of fall 2017, about 60% of undergraduates were from Pennsylvania, 16% were from New Jersey, and 18% were from Delaware.\n\nNeumann University is a member of the Atlantic East Conference as well as the United Collegiate Hockey Conference (UCHC). It competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Division III. In 2009 Neumann University's Men's Ice Hockey Team won the NCAA Division III National Championship In the summer of 2012, Neumann University constructed the Mirenda Center, a 72,000 square foot athletic complex which houses an indoor track, NCAA Division III regulation basketball court, dance studios, student lounges, a classroom, weight and cardio rooms as well as the Center for Sport Spirituality and Character Development.\n\nNeumann sponsors 12 women's athletic teams and 10 men's teams. In addition the 22 varsity teams, Neumann University also has a very active club sports roster which includes baseball, basketball, cheer leading, a dance team, ice hockey, roller hockey as well as men's and women's rugby.

{"id": "2202683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202683", "title": "Matthew 5:22", "text": "Matthew 5:22\n\nMatthew 5:22 is the twenty-second verse of the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament and is part of the Sermon on the Mount. It is the first of what have traditionally been known as the 6 Antitheses. In this one, Jesus compares the current interpretation of \"You shall not murder\" from the Ten Commandments (; ) with his own interpretation.\n\nThe Koine Greek text, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as: \n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:22\n\nThis verse asserts that just as great a crime as murder itself, is the anger that leads to it. Schweizer notes that this view is not particularly new to Jesus, appearing in the Old Testament at places such as and in works such as Sirach, the Slavonic Enoch, Pesahim, and Nedraim. A similar teaching also appears at . Gundry notes that \"I say to you\" is one of Matthew's favourite phrases using it 68 times. Schweizer feels it is used here to link to the word of God in the previous verse.\n\nDavies and Allison note that the references to brothers is probably an allusion to the story of Cain and Abel. Nolland notes that the word usually translated as \"brother\" is gender neutral in the original Greek, and is more accurately translated as \"brother or sister.\" Harrington notes that \"brother\" does not literally refer to sibling, or even to just the small group of followers or disciples. Rather he states that the verse should be read as referring to all Israelites or all human beings. France disagrees, feeling that in this particular verse Jesus is referring only to the group of disciples.\n\nEarly manuscripts are divided between whether this verse should read \"whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment\" or \"whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment.\" The two versions are significantly different in implication and most modern scholars feel that \"without a cause\" was a later addition by a copyist trying to make the statement less radical. This was also the view of some Church Fathers.\n\nThe word Raca is original to the Greek manuscript; however, it is not a Greek word. The most common view is that it is a reference to the Aramaic word \"reka\", which literally means \"empty one\", but probably meant \"empty headed,\" or \"foolish.\" Scholars seem divided on how grievous an insult it was. Hill feels it was very, France thinks it was a minor slur. The word translated as \"fool\" is the Greek \"moros\", which has a similar meaning to the Aramaic \"reka\". However \"moros\" also was used to mean \"godless\", and thus could be much more severe a term than \"reka\". The reading of godless can explain why the punishment is more severe. Jesus uses the term himself in when he is deriding the Pharisees.\n\nThis verse has also recently become part of the debate over the New Testament view of homosexuality. Some scholars have argued that \"raca\" can mean effeminate, and was a term of abuse for homosexuals. Similarly \"moros\" can also refer to a homosexual aggressor; as . From Semitic cognates Warren Johansson argued that the word was an Aramaic pejorative, similar to the English words \"faggot\" or \"fairy\". By these interpretations Jesus could be specifically condemning homophobia. Most scholars reject this view, considering it more likely that the terms were meant as general insults, rather than specific attacks on homosexuals. See also the Bible and homosexuality.\n\nWhile some scholars have searched for one, the offenses in the verse do not seem to increase in severity. By contrast the verse contains an escalating scale of punishment. Those that are angry with their brother are said to be subject to judgement. This is often interpreted as the judgement of the local council, which would mete out justice in a community. The council is generally seen as a reference to the Sanhedrin, the council of leading religious thinkers that acted as the central court in Jerusalem. Most controversial is what fate is implied by the third punishment. In Greek the word used is Gehenna, it refers to a valley south of Jerusalem where there was an ever-burning rubbish fire, and where in the past human sacrifices were committed. \n\nIn the Old Testament, followers of various Ba'als and gods in the Canaanite pantheon, including Moloch, sacrificed their children by fire, especially in the area Tophet (, ). Thereafter it was deemed to be cursed (, ).\n\nSome scholars believe this to be a metaphor for damnation and for Hell, and traditionally it was translated this way. Albright and Mann reject this view and conclude that Jesus was here literally referring to the valley and the potential of being thrown in there as punishment. Gehenna appears six other times in the Gospel of Matthew: , , , , , and \n\nSome scholars reject the idea that the first two sections refer to secular institutions. Albright and Mann argue that only God could know a person's internal emotions, and no human institution could punish such crimes. Hill argues that this verse has been misunderstood as applying to the general population. He believes that the reference to brothers means that these rules are not meant for society at large, but only the disciples and leaders of the new religion, and that the council refers to an internal structure.\n"}

The song was on the group's first album, \"Ring Ring\", released in 1973.\n\n\nAs the majority of ABBA songs were, \"People Need Love\" was written and composed by the two male band members, Benny Andersson & Björn Ulvaeus. It was engineered by Michael Tretow who aimed to create a Phil Spector-like wall of sound on the recording.\n\nAlthough their debut album did not bring them to global attention, it follows some standards of ABBA's style. The ballad is about what people can give each other to make their lives easier and create a better world.\n\nThe basic aim of the \"People Need Love\" single was not to promote the quartet, since all four individuals had other commitments and did not have the time to form a permanent group (an example of this is the crediting; the single in most of the territories is credited to \"Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid\"), but to promote the \"Björn & Benny\" duo, which was the singing and songwriting partnership of the two men. The women were simply guesting on the new \"Björn & Benny\" single. However, the very positive audience reaction was unexpected.\n\n\"People Need Love\" made the Top 20 of the combined Swedish singles and albums chart, and reached No. 3 on the popular Swedish radio chart show, \"Tio i topp\" (The Top Ten). It was the foursome's first charting record in the United States, where it peaked at No. 114 on the Cashbox singles chart and No. 117 on Record World singles chart. The Playboy Records U.S. release was credited to \"Bjorn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka)\", and according to ABBA's manager Stig Anderson, could have been a much bigger American hit, if not for the limited distribution resources of the label that was unable to meet the demand from retailers and radio programmers.\n\nAt the time of the single's release, the \"Ring Ring\" album had not been planned, since there was no intention to form a permanent group. However, the song was included on the album the following year. Although recorded earlier than most of the album, it can retroactively be considered the lead single from \"Ring Ring\".\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium the single had its release in August 1973 as the follow-up to the highly successful single \"Ring Ring\". It however performed rather badly, reaching just no. 47 on the Radio Noordzee Top 50 from the Dutch service of Radio North Sea International. \n\nA Swedish country band called Nashville Train (which included some of ABBA's own backing band members) covered the song in 1977 on their album \"ABBA Our Way\", released on the Polar Music label in Sweden.\n\n"}

The effect when running is similar to running without shoes.\n\nThe shoe was originally, and often still is in parts of the United Kingdom, called a \"sand shoe\" and acquired the nickname \"plimsoll\" in the 1870s. This name arose, according to Nicholette Jones's book \"The Plimsoll Sensation\", because the coloured horizontal band joining the upper to the sole resembled the Plimsoll line on a ship's hull, or because, just like the Plimsoll line on a ship, if water got above the line of the rubber sole, the wearer would get wet.\n\nIn the UK plimsolls are commonly worn for schools' indoor physical education lessons. Regional terms are common: in Northern Ireland and central Scotland they are sometimes known as \"gutties\"; \"sannies\" (from 'sand shoe') is also used in Scotland. In parts of the West Country and Wales they are known as \"daps\" or \"dappers\". In London, the home counties, much of the West Midlands, the West Riding of Yorkshire and north west of England they are known as \"pumps\". There is a widespread belief that \"daps\" is taken from a factory sign – \"Dunlop Athletic Plimsoles\" which was called \"the DAP factory\". However, this seems unlikely as the first citation in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" of \"dap\" for a rubber soled shoe is a March 1924 use in the \"Western Daily Press\" newspaper; Dunlop did not acquire the Liverpool Rubber Company (as part of the merger with the Macintosh group of companies) until 1925. Plimsolls were issued to the British military (called 'road slappers' by the common soldiery) until replaced by trainers in the mid-80's. If white they required hours of application of shoe whitener, if black they were required to be polished until they gleamed. \n\nAs it was commonly used for corporal punishment in the British Commonwealth, where it was the typical gym shoe (part of the school uniform), plimsolling is also a synonym for a slippering.\n\nPlimsolls are referred to as:\n"}

R. Martin. In some areas, the paperback edition was published in two parts, titled \"Dreams and Dust\" and \"After the Feast\". It was the only novel in the series to be published during the eight-season run of the HBO adaptation of the series, \"Game of Thrones\", and runs to 1,040 pages with a word count of almost 415,000.\n\nThe US hardcover was officially published on July 12, 2011, and a few weeks later went to No. 1 on both \"Publishers Weekly\" and \"USA Today\" bestsellers lists. The novel has been adapted for television as the fifth season of \"Game of Thrones\", although elements of the book have also appeared in the series' third, fourth and sixth seasons.\n\nStannis Baratheon, a claimant to the Iron Throne of Westeros, occupies the Wall at the realm's northern border, having helped to repel an invasion of wildlings from the northern wilderness. Stannis executes Mance Rayder, the leader of the wildlings, for refusing to submit to him, and marches his army south to seek support in his bid for the throne.\n\nJon Snow, the newly elected Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, the order that defends the Wall, prepares the defense against the Others, hostile inhuman creatures from the far north. Jon negotiates with wildling leader Tormund Giantsbane to the wildlings past the Wall in exchange for their assistance in defending it. This results in a fragile peace but creates unrest among the Night's Watch, who have considered the wildlings their enemies for centuries.\n\nStannis's advisor, the sorceress Melisandre, warns Jon that his half-sister, Arya Stark, is in trouble. Mance is revealed to be alive, thanks to Melisandre's magical trickery. He is sent to the Starks' ancestral castle Winterfell, now occupied by the enemy Boltons, to rescue Arya. However, the girl in Melisandre's visions turns out to be Alys Karstark, a young noblewoman fleeing to the Wall to escape her treacherous uncle. To protect Alys and aid the wildlings' integration into Westerosi society, Jon arranges for Alys to marry Sigorn of Thenn, a wildling leader.\n\nJon receives a taunting letter from Ramsay Bolton, who claims to have crushed Stannis's army at Winterfell. Threatening attack, Ramsay demands that Jon send him Stannis's wife, daughter, and other hostages, in addition to Arya and Jon's foster-brother Theon Greyjoy, the latter two whom Jon hasn't seen in years. Jon decides to march on Ramsay himself and asks for volunteers to accompany him. His officers view Jon's intent to march on Ramsay as a betrayal of the Watch's neutrality and he is stabbed in a mutiny.\n\nMeanwhile, Jon's crippled half-brother Bran Stark, traveling north of the Wall, is led to the last surviving Children of the Forest, the non-human natives of Westeros. They introduce Bran and his companions to the \"last greenseer\", an ancient man intertwined with the roots of a weirwood tree. He helps Bran learn clairvoyant \"greensight\", enabling Bran to witness the past and present through the eyes of the weirwood trees that grow throughout the North.\n\nHaving killed his father Tywin, the Hand of the King, the dwarf Tyrion Lannister is smuggled out of Westeros to the city of Pentos by the spymaster Varys, where he is sheltered by the aristocrat Illyrio Mopatis. Tyrion is sent south with a party ostensibly to aid the exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen, who controls the only living dragons, in claiming the Iron Throne. Tyrion learns that Varys and Illyrio have hidden the presumed-dead Aegon Targaryen, son of Daenerys's late brother Prince Rhaegar, and intend to install him as king of Westeros with Daenerys's aid. Tyrion persuades Aegon to invade Westeros immediately, without waiting for Daenerys. Soon afterward, Tyrion is kidnapped by Daenerys's disgraced advisor Jorah Mormont, who intends to deliver him to Daenerys in order to regain her favor.\n\nIn the Free City of Braavos, Arya is an acolyte of the guild of assassins known as the Faceless Men. When they temporarily afflict her with blindness, Arya develops her sense of hearing, and realizes that she can \"see\" through cats the same way she could with her pet direwolf, Nymeria. After her sight is restored, Arya is tasked with assassinating a corrupt merchant while magically disguised with another girl's face. After doing so, Arya is declared an apprentice of the Faceless Men, to be sent to another assassin to continue her training.\n\nDaenerys has conquered the city of Meereen and banned slavery, but struggles to maintain peace among various factions within the city, including the Sons of the Harpy, a violent Meereenese resistance group, and with the neighboring city of Yunkai. \n\nDaenerys' dragons have become increasingly dangerous, and she reluctantly confines them in a dungeon for the safety of her people. Drogon, the largest, evades capture and flies off. Despite her sexual relationship with the mercenary Daario Naharis, Daenerys marries the Meereenese nobleman Hizdahr zo Loraq to secure an alliance to appease the Sons of the Harpy.\n\nQuentyn Martell, the son of the Prince of Dorne in southern Westeros, arrives in Meereen in hopes of renewing the alliance between Daenerys's family and his, but he is unable to maintain her attention. Jorah and Tyrion are shipwrecked, kidnapped, and sold to a Yunkish slave trader. Tyrion escapes from the Yunkish army besieging Meereen, joins the Second Sons mercenary group, and secures their support for Daenerys. Meanwhile, another Westerosi, Victarion Greyjoy, sails for Meereen, intending to marry Daenerys and use her dragons to overthrow his brother, the king of the Ironborn.\n\nAt Hizdahr's insistence, Daenerys reopens the city's \"fighting pits\" for gladiatorial combat, but the noise and carnage attract Drogon. In the resulting chaos, Daenerys climbs onto Drogon to calm him but he flies away with her. Hizdahr is implicated in an attempt to poison Daenerys. Her advisor, Barristan Selmy, removes Hizdahr from power, and the Sons of the Harpy resume their killing. Barristan prepares for battle with the armies outside Meereen. Quentyn attempts to prove his worth by riding one of the remaining dragons but is killed and both dragons are released. \n\nDrogon flies Daenerys to the Dothraki Sea, the grassland controlled by the nomadic Dothraki people. After several days, Daenerys encounters a Dothraki horde led by Khal Jhaqo.\n\nIn the North, Roose Bolton has overthrown House Stark and assumed authority as the Warden of the North after allying with House Frey. Much of the region is occupied by Ironborn invaders. Under Jon Snow's advice, Stannis wins the support of northern mountain clans by pledging to recapture Winterfell and fighting off the Ironborn. With their support, Stannis captures Asha Greyjoy, Victarion's niece, and marches his forces toward Winterfell to attack the Boltons, but his advance is halted by heavy snowstorms.\n\nStannis's advisor Davos Seaworth is sent win the support of the wealthy lord Wyman Manderly, who pretends to execute Davos to curry favor with the Lannister regime that controls the Iron Throne. In a secret meeting, Manderly tells Davos that he and other Northern vassals intend to feign submission to the Boltons and Lannisters while plotting revenge for Robb Stark's death. Revealing to Davos that young Rickon Stark is in hiding on the remote island of Skagos, Manderly pledges to support Stannis if Davos can retrieve Rickon and unite the Starks' supporters around him.\n\nTheon Greyjoy is a prisoner of the Boltons, and is mutilated and tortured by Roose's sadistic son Ramsay, who renames Theon \"Reek\". To cement his rule over the North, Roose has Ramsay supposedly married to Arya Stark, but the girl is actually Jeyne Poole, a friend of Arya's sister Sansa, who is forced to impersonate Arya and physically and sexually tormented by Ramsay. A disguised Mance Rayder arrives at Winterfell and enlists Theon to help him free the false Arya. Theon and Jeyne escape, leaping from the castle wall into the snow to be captured by Stannis's forces.\n\nJaime Lannister, the uncle (and, secretly, father) of the young king Tommen Baratheon, negotiates the surrender of the last of the late Robb Stark's allies, nominally putting an end to the Stark–Lannister war in the Riverlands. Brienne of Tarth, whom Jaime had sent to search for Sansa Stark, finds Jaime and tells him Sansa is in danger; he follows after her.\n\nAfter Tyrion convinces Aegon to attack Westeros, Aegon and his forces capture several castles in the Stormlands with little resistance. Meanwhile, Aegon's foster father Jon Connington is secretly succumbing to greyscale, a deadly and infectious disease.\n\nDoran Martell, the prince of Dorne, sends three of his nieces north to the capital city of King's Landing to infiltrate the Faith and the government and work in Dorne's interests.\n\nCersei Lannister, Tommen's mother and queen regent, has been arrested by the Faith on charges of fornication and conspiracy. To gain release from her imprisonment, she confesses to several of the lesser charges against her, but does not confess to having murdered her husband King Robert Baratheon, nor that her children are the product of incest. As a condition of her release, Cersei is forced to humiliate herself by walking naked across the city. Meanwhile, Cersei's ally, the ex-maester Qyburn, has created \"Ser Robert Strong\", an eight-foot-tall figure encased in armor, to be an unbeatable champion in Cersei's upcoming trial by combat.\n\nHaving taken control of the government, Cersei's uncle Kevan Lannister and the Grand Maester Pycelle attempt to undo the damage caused by Cersei's misrule. However, Varys reappears and murders both Kevan and Pycelle, revealing that he has been plotting for years for the Lannisters to destroy themselves so that Aegon Targaryen can take the throne, having been raised to be an ideal ruler. The book ends with Varys sending his child spies to finish Kevan off.\n\nIn addition to the maps published in previous books, the book includes a new map of the previously-unmapped area of the Free Cities on the eastern continent. Like the previous four volumes in the \"Ice and Fire\" series, the book includes an appendix with a complete list of characters.\n\nThe story is narrated from the point of view of 18 different characters, including two minor one-off point-of-view (POV) characters featured in the prologue and epilogue. All but two POV characters were identified before the book's release.\n\nIn the North:\n\nIn the eastern continent of Essos:\n\nIn the South:\n\nChapters for several POVs, which may include Sansa Stark, Samwell Tarly, Aeron Damphair, Arianne Martell, and Brienne of Tarth were written for the book, but they will instead tentatively appear in the next book, \"The Winds of Winter\".\n\n\"A Dance with Dragons\" was originally intended to be the title of the second novel in the sequence, when Martin still envisioned the series as a trilogy. Some early US editions of \"A Game of Thrones\" (1996) list \"A Dance of Dragons\" as the forthcoming second volume in the series. The 1998 anthology \"Legends\", which features the novella \"The Hedge Knight\" from the same universe, listed \"A Dance of Dragons\" as the third installment of a four-book series.\n\nIn May 2005 Martin announced that the \"sheer size\" of his still-unfinished manuscript for \"A Feast for Crows\" had led him and his publishers to split the narrative into two books. Rather than divide the text in half chronologically, Martin opted to instead split the material by character and location, resulting in \"two novels taking place simultaneously\" with different casts of characters. Published in 2005, \"A Feast for Crows\" is narrated primarily by characters in the South of the Seven Kingdoms and in the new locations of the Iron Islands and Dorne. \"A Dance with Dragons\" features characters in the North and across the narrow sea, although Jaime Lannister, Cersei Lannister, Arya Stark, Areo Hotah and Victarion and Asha Greyjoy appear in both volumes.\n\nApproximately one-third of the published \"A Dance with Dragons\" consists of material that had been written for the pre-split \"A Feast for Crows\", although much of this has been rewritten by Martin.\n\nIn 2009, Martin confirmed that, contrary to earlier statements, Sansa Stark would not appear in \"A Dance with Dragons\"; Sansa chapters initially slated for the novel have instead been pushed back to \"The Winds of Winter\", which is planned to be the sixth book in the series. In early 2010, Martin noted that his intent for \"A Dance with Dragons\" was for the first 800 manuscript pages to cover the alternate characters in the same time span as \"A Feast for Crows\", and that \"Everything that follows is post-\"Feast\", so that's where some of the cast from the last book start popping up again.\" Stating that \"I wanted to resolve at least a few of the cliffhangers from \"Feast\",\" Martin also mentioned the possibility that some of his finished chapters might get pushed to the next novel, \"The Winds of Winter,\" depending on the length of the finished manuscript for \"A Dance with Dragons\".\n\nDespite original, optimistic predictions of possible completion in late 2006, Martin completed the novel in April 2011, nearly five years later. During this period, Martin's blog featured sporadic updates on his progress, and in January 2008 he posted an update affirming his vigilant commitment to finishing the novel. In early 2008, publisher Spectra Books (a division of Random House) announced that \"A Dance with Dragons\" would be released on September 30, 2008, but Martin stated this would only be possible if he finished writing by the end of June, before his trip to Spain and Portugal; he did not meet his goal.\n\nOn February 19, 2009, Martin posted on his website: \"I am trying to finish the book by June. I think I can do that. If I do, \"A Dance with Dragons\" will likely be published in September or October.\" On June 22, 2009, the author expressed \"guarded optimism\" with respect to his progress on the novel, while still not confirming a publication date. When asked in a July 2009 interview with \"FREE! Magazine\" how the book was going, Martin stated, \"It is going pretty well, actually. I am hoping to finish it by September or October; that is my goal.\" On October 6, 2009, Martin said that his working manuscript for \"A Dance With Dragons\" had just exceeded 1,100 pages of completed chapters, plus \"considerably more in partials, fragments, and roughs.\" He noted that this made the upcoming novel longer than his earlier books \"A Game of Thrones\" and \"A Feast for Crows\", and nearly as long as \"A Clash of Kings\".\n\nOn March 2, 2010, Martin remarked that he had reached 1,311 manuscript pages, making \"Dance\" the second-longest novel in the series at that point, behind only the 1,521-page manuscript of \"A Storm of Swords\". On July 8, 2010, Martin spoke at a conference and confirmed the current length of the book to be 1,400 manuscript pages. He expressed his disappointment that he was unable to completely finish the novel by the conference, although he would not speculate how soon the book would be completed after his return home on July 11. At the same conference, Martin also confirmed that he has written one Sansa, one Arya, and two Arianne chapters for the planned sixth novel, \"Winds of Winter\", and had transferred two Cersei chapters from that book into \"A Dance with Dragons\". On August 7, 2010, Martin confirmed that he had completed eight POVs, excluding the prologue and epilogue.\n\nAt the New York Comic Con on October 10, 2010, Spectra senior editor Anne Groell announced that Martin had only five chapters remaining to finish, with sections of the chapters already completed. She stated her desire to have the manuscript completed by December. In a December 2010 interview with Bear Swarm, Martin stated that he almost had \"A Dance With Dragons\" completed.\n\nOn March 3, 2011, the publisher announced that the novel, though at that point still not completed, would be officially published on July 12, 2011. Martin claimed this July 2011 publication date was different from the previous publication dates mentioned, in that this was \"real\", as opposed to earlier \"wishful thinking, boundless optimism, cockeyed dreams, [and] honest mistakes\". On March 12, he revealed that the unfinished manuscript had exceeded \"A Storm of Swords\" in length, making it the longest volume in the entire series. On March 27, he announced that the manuscript had exceeded 1,600 pages.<ref name=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/204875.html\"></ref> On April 27, 2011, it was announced that Martin had completed \"A Dance with Dragons\". After incorporating requested changes made by his book editor and her staff copy-editors, suggested final draft notes from trusted friends, and his own final \"sweat\" (a line-by-line reread done to tighten and eliminate any unnecessary \"fat\" remaining in the manuscript), the final draft had been reduced to 1,510 pages; this made \"Dragons\" the second-longest novel, by a narrow margin, to volume three, \"A Storm of Swords\". The novel was now ready to meet its July 12, 2011 release date.\n\nOn June 29, 2011, Amazon Germany had mistakenly released 180 copies of the novel early. Martin requested that those who held copies not spoil the book for fans who had to wait. Several \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" websites put an embargo in place on their forums with the same intent.\n\nForeign-language editions\n\n\"The Atlantic\" Rachael Brown found \"A Dance with Dragons\" \"infinitely more satisfying than its predecessor, 2005's bleak and plodding \"A Feast for Crows\". The aspects of Martin's work that have endeared him to fans are abundant here – rich world building, narrative twists and turns, and gritty depictions of the human struggle for power. Characters who were sorely missed in \"Feast\" – Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and Jon Snow – make up more than a third of the novel, and Martin is wise enough to give us at least a chapter from (almost) everyone else. Weaknesses that have plagued Martin's previous books are also present: too much repetition, unexceptional prose, and characters who use the same idioms (and have sex in exactly the same manner) no matter their ethnicity, social class, or continent. But while \"A Dance with Dragons\" cries out for better editing, it remains entirely engrossing. Martin has hidden so many clues and red herrings throughout his previous volumes that it is a thrill to see certain pieces fall into place.\"\n\nRemy Verhoeve of \"The Huffington Post\" said, \"\"A Dance with Dragons\" is just a book, of course. It is not the Second Coming or anything. And I understand that the author must feel a lot of pressure concerning this one (he should). It's late and it has to repair some of the damage done by \"A Feast for Crows\", which frankly felt as if it was written by a ghost writer at times. Finally it is here, and some of the things we've been wondering about for more than a decade are actually revealed (not everything, but at least some things). It has the same structural problems as the previous book; it is sprawling and incoherent at times, but at least the characters are more interesting than in the previous installment. It does feel like I'm reading a bunch of separate stories within the same setting–the chapters are told through the eyes of various characters–but that doesn't really bother me as I love the setting and like to see it through various points of view. Theories that have been bandied about online for the last ten years mostly come true in this book, so in that respect the novel isn't shocking but neither is it disappointing. Martin also manages to put in a few twists, but ends the book much like he did the previous one with cliffhangers instead of wrapping things up a little better so the next long wait won't hurt so much.\"\n\nDavid Orr of \"The New York Times\" said, \"\"A Dance With Dragons\" comes in at roughly 9,574,622,012 pages, and smart money says the final two books in the series will make this one look like 'The Old Man and the Sea'. Such length isn't necessary, and it hurts Martin's prose and his plot mechanics. Tyrion 'waddles' at least 12 times here, and even if we suppose the unflattering word reflects Tyrion's contempt for his own awkward gait, it seems unlikely he would indulge this contempt when he's, say, fighting for his life. Similarly, when your novel's terrain stretches across hundreds of miles and your world lacks jet propulsion, as an author you face some basic problems of transportation that can result in conveyance via Rube Goldberg.\"\n\n\"Time\" James Poniewozik found a possible \"weakness to the early Meereen sections [by] marking time (and making Dany uncharacteristically indecisive) to allow time for all the pieces to fall into place\" and said, \"All this makes for a thousand-page book that feels half as long, that moves dextrously, answers key questions and gobsmacks you with convincing feints and change-ups. As in \"AFFC\", there are sections that feel like they could have used an editor. In some chapters you suddenly find yourself in a strange land with a character you have little attachment to, wondering where this thread is going, as if you had stayed too long at a party after the friends you came with have left.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" Bill Sheehan said, \"Filled with vividly rendered set pieces, unexpected turnings, assorted cliffhangers and moments of appalling cruelty, \"A Dance With Dragons\" is epic fantasy as it should be written: passionate, compelling, convincingly detailed and thoroughly imagined. Despite a number of overtly fantastic elements (dragons, seers, shape shifters and sorcerers), the book—and the series as a whole—feels grounded in the brutal reality of medieval times and has more in common with the Wars of the Roses than it does with \"The Lord of the Rings\". The result is a complex summer blockbuster with brains and heart, a book with rare—and potentially enormous—appeal.\n\nMegan Wasson of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" said, \"\"A Dance with Dragons\" may well be one of the best books in the five-book series so far. Martin's prose is concise but pithy, begging to be devoured over and over again. All the fans' favorite characters make an appearance, unlike in the last book. But what truly sets this book above some of the others in the series is Martin's ability to keep his readers on their toes and the edges of their seats.

{"id": "2202710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202710", "title": "Laff Records", "text": "Laff Records\n\nLaff Records was a small American independent record label specializing in comedy and party records originating on the West Coast of the United States during the 1970s. Amongst their artists were Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, LaWanda Page, George Carlin, black ventriloquist duo Richard And Willie, Kip Addotta, Belle Barth, Rex Benson, and Skillet & Leroy. \n\nReleases on Laff were notorious for their raunchy content on both the record and its album jacket. Many of these titles have had to be denoted with an \"Adults Only\" warning on the front cover and sold under the counter, decades before the infamous Parental Advisory sticker was a fixture on album covers. Many Laff album covers featured topless models. Laff also became notorious both for the questionable quality of its record pressings and for its frequent repackaging of previously released titles with new titles and artwork. Richard Pryor's vast quantity of releases issued by Laff is a case in point. Pryor released only one album for Laff, \"Craps (After Hours)\", with his direct participation and then later signed a deal with the larger Stax label. Laff sued Pryor after Stax released \"That Nigger's Crazy\" in 1974; the case was settled when Laff gave Pryor his freedom in exchange for being allowed to compile albums from recordings it made with Pryor between 1969 and 1973.\n\nLaff went out of business sometime in the 1980s, with their last \"hit\" recording being Kip Addotta's \"Wet Dream\" (a favorite of fans of the Dr. Demento radio show), but many of their more profitable recordings still circulated through other labels for some time afterward. In 1993 Island Records briefly re-released on cassette and compact disc some Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx titles that had been originally issued by Laff, including Pryor's \"Craps (After Hours)\". These releases disappeared from store shelves after Island's parent company PolyGram was absorbed by Universal Music.\n\nIn 2002 Richard Pryor and his wife/manager, Jennifer Lee Pryor, purchased the rights to all of Richard's Laff masters and raw tapes from San Juan Music, the successor in interest to Laff Records. The Pryors then gave free rein to Rhino Records to go through the tapes and make an anthology that included the entire \"Craps (After Hours)\" album and the best of other Laff releases. The results were released in 2005 on the 2-CD set \".\n\nSome of the remaining Laff masters have been reissued by Uproar Entertainment.\n\nNote that there were several earlier, unrelated companies that issued 78 RPM discs under the name Laff Records in the late 1940s. Of these, one was based in New York, a second was allegedly from Chicago, and a third released titles under the name Laff-Disc (later abbreviated to L D). All were probably defunct long before the Los Angeles label began operations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202712", "title": "Paromomycin", "text": "Paromomycin\n\nParomomycin is an antimicrobial used to treat a number of parasitic infections including amebiasis, giardiasis, leishmaniasis, and tapeworm infection. It is a first-line treatment for amebiasis or giardiasis during pregnancy. Otherwise it is generally a second line treatment option. It is used by mouth, applied to the skin, or by injection into a muscle.\nCommon side effects when taken by mouth include loss of appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. When applied to the skin side effects include itchiness, redness, and blisters. When given by injection there may be fever, liver problems, or hearing loss. Use during breastfeeding appears to be safe. Paromomycin is in the aminoglycoside family of medications and causes microbe death by stopping the creation of bacterial proteins.\nParomomycin was discovered in the 1950s from a type of streptomyces and came into medical use in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Paromomycin is available as a generic medication. In India the injectable form is about 4.19 to 8.38 pounds for a course of treatment as of 2007. In the United States a typical course of treatment is more than US$200 as of 2015.\n\nIt is an antimicrobial used to treat intestinal parasitic infections such as cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis, and other diseases such as leishmaniasis.\nParomomycin was demonstrated to be effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis in clinical studies in the USSR in the 1960s, and in trials with visceral leishmaniasis in the early 1990s.\n\nThe route of administration is intramuscular injection and capsule.\nParomomycin topical cream with or without gentamicin is an effective treatment for ulcerative cutaneous leishmaniasis, according to the results of a phase-3, randomized, double-blind, parallel group–controlled trial.\n\nThe medication is poorly absorbed. The effect it may have on the baby is still unknown.\n\nThere is limited data regarding the safety of taking paromomycin while breastfeeding but because the drug is poorly absorbed minimal amounts of drug will be secreted in breastmilk.\n\nThere is limited evidence that paromomycin can be used in persons coinfected with HIV and \"Cryptosporidium.\" A few small trials have showed a reduction in oocyst shedding after treatment with paromomycin.\n\nThe most common adverse effects associated with paromomycin sulfate are abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. Long-term use of paromomycin increases the risk for bacterial or fungal infection. Signs of overgrowth include white patches in the oral cavities. Other less common adverse events include myasthenia gravis, kidney damage, enterocolitis, malabsorption syndrome, eosinophilia, headache, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, itching, severe dizziness, and pancreatitis.\n\nParomomycin belongs to the aminoglycoside drug class and therefore are toxic to the kidneys and to ears. These toxicities are additive and are more likely to occur when used with other drugs that cause ear and kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of foscarnet increases the risk of kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of colistimethate and paromomycin can cause a dangerous slowing of breathing known as respiratory depression, and should be done with extreme caution if necessary. When used with systemic antibiotics such as paromomycin, the cholera vaccine can cause an immune response. Use with strong diuretics, which can also harm hearing, should be avoided. Paromomycin may have dangerous reactions when used with the paralytic succinylcholine by increasing its neuromuscular effects.\n\nThere are no known food or drink interactions with paromomycin.\n\nParomomycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor in nonresistant cells by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA. This broad-spectrum antibiotic soluble in water, is very similar in action to neomycin. Antimicrobial activity of paromomycin against \"Escherichia coli \"and \"Staphylococcus aureus\" has been shown. Paromomycin works as an antibiotic by increasing the error rate in ribosomal translation. Paromomcyin binds to a RNA loop, where residues A1492 and A1493 are usually stacked, and expels these two residues. These two residues are involved in detection of correct Watson-Crick pairing between the codon and anti codon. When correct interactions are achieved, the binding provides energy to expel the two residues. Paromocyin binding provides enough energy for residue expulsion and thus results in the ribosome incorporating the incorrect amino acid into the nascent peptide chain.\n\nGI absorption is poor. Any obstructions or factors which impair GI motility may increase the absorption of the drug from the digestive tract. In addition, any structural damage, such as lesions or ulcerations, will tend to increase drug absorption.\n\nFor intramuscular (IM) injection, the absorption is rapid. Paromomycin will reach peak plasma concentration within one hour following IM injection. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities parallel those of neomycin.\n\nInformation not available.\n\nAlmost 100% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged via feces. Any absorbed drug will be excreted in urine.\n\nParomomycin was discovered in the 1950s amongst the secondary metabolites of a variety of \"Streptomyces\" then known as \"Streptomyces krestomuceticus\", now known as \"Streptomyces rimosus\". It came into medical use in 1960.\n"}

He has worked on ambitious, experimental and original projects with various musicians, such as Psychic TV, Current 93, Sigur Rós, Steindór Andersen and Eivør Pálsdóttir.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1975 he was playing drums in a school band called Fatima with guitarist Jóhannes Helgason, bassist Birgir Ottóson and singer Guðmundur Eyjólfsson. In 1974 singer Eiríkur Hauksson replaced Guðmundur and guitarist Sigurgeir Sigmundsson joined them and a year after they broke up.\n\nBy 1979 Hilmar Örn was playing drums and occasionally the synthesizer in a band called Fellibylur (Hurricane) with vocalist Magnús Guðmundsson and bassist Hilmar Örn Agnarsson. The band was expanded with the arrival of singers Elín Reynisdóttir, guitarist Jóhannes Helgason and drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson and with the new line-up, they created a new band called Frostrósir (Frost Roses) that played mainly disco music.<br>\nThe band changed their name to Þeyr and released the debut album in December 1980 with the title \"Þagað í Hel\" which contained some lyrics written by Hilmar Örn.<br>\nÞeyr underwent internal changes and Eiríkur left the band and guitarists Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and Þorsteinn Magnússon joined in. The music evolved dramatically with the new members and Elín and Jóhannes left the band. The new Þeyr became very famous in Iceland with \"Útfrymi\" and \"Mjötviður Mær\", among other releases, and Hilmar Örn collaborated with them with some lyrics and art works, and also managed the band from 1981 to 1982 with Guðni Ragnar Agnarsson creating Esquimaux Management (Eskvimó, in Icelandic), an independent record label and book publisher.<br>\nÞeyr held a deep interest in science, magic and philosophy and Hilmar Örn served as an influential figure. Guðni and Hilmar withdrew from the band’s management in 1983 and were replaced by Guðmundur Sigurfreyr Jónason, the same year Þeyr disbanded.\n\nIn 1984 Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and singer Björk Guðmundsdóttir, who at that time were in KUKL formed The Elgar Sisters, Hilmar joined them next to Einar Arnaldur Melax, Sigtryggur Baldursson, Þorsteinn Magnússon and Birgir Mogensen to record 11 songs from 1984 to 1986 and disbanded afterwards.<br>\nThe Elgar Sisters did not release any album, but some of their works were featured during the solo careers of Björk and Guðlaugur.\n\nIn 1987 Hilmar began to work with Current 93, a band led by David Tibet and collaborated with 10 releases, among them, he produced the single \"Crowleymass\" in 1987 and in 1991 produced \"Island\", an album which featured singer Björk as backing vocalist on the song “Falling”. He also collaborated with the band Ornamental in 1988.\n\nMÖK Trio was a group formed by bassist Tómas Magnús Tómasson (known by his work in Stuðmenn), Hilmar Örn and Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson. In fact, the name stemmed from the initials corresponding to the middle name of each member. Their first gig was by 1992. MÖK Trio did not play regularly and they never released any album. Their last presentation was in August 2001 at Galdrahátíðin á Ströndum, Reykjavík.\n\nIn 1992 he started to record with singer and trumpet player Einar Örn Benediktsson (from The Sugarcubes) on a new project called Frostbite and released an album titled \"The Second Coming\" the following year through label One Little Indian, but after this, the band was dissolved.<br>\nHis collaborations continued with sound engineer Andrew McKenzie in The Hafler Trio (H3ÖH) and in 1993 released an album called \"Bootleg H3ÖH\" which contained remixes from Frostbite.\n\nBy November 1997 Hilmar and Einar Örn joined drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson to form Grindverk. After signing with FatCat Records they released their debut album, a 12-inch vinyl titled \"Gesundheit von K\" on 1 January 1999.<br>\nWith 4 tracks, \"Gesundheit von K\" encompassed a wide range of styles: from the industrial funk of the title song to the exotic jazz of “Kastrato”. Grindverk showed with this album a dark music, with free instruments proper of the funk music or post industrialism of the eighties but in the context of the nineties.<br>\nThey were supposed to release an album called \"T.h.e.r.a.p.i.s.t.s\" by July 1999, but it was canceled as Grindverk disbanded shortly after their debut release.\n\nHilmar Örn & Sigur Rós: In 2000 he collaborated with Sigur Rós on the soundtrack to the film \"Angels of the Universe\", which was directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson. This seventeen-track album contained fifteen songs composed by HÖH with his mellow soothing trademark sound (classical guitars, strings and synthesizers) and two songs created by Sigur Rós (“Bíum Bíum Bambaló” and “Dánarfregnir og Jarðafarir”). Later, he also worked with Sigur Rós composing and performing on “Hrafnagaldr Óðins”.\n\nGVDL: Was another music project formed in 2001 with Guðlaugur K. Óttarsson and bass player Georg Bjarnason. The group was established for the arrival in Iceland by the American band Fuck. In fact, the name of the band were the initials of the American group shifted one place further. They only had one performance at Kaffi Reykjavík, without recording any track.\n\nIn 2004 Hilmar Örn collaborated with singer Eivør Pálsdóttir in a joint project between Iceland and Ireland and performed with other musicians from both countries in two concerts, one in Reykjavík and the other in Tórshavn, in the Faroe Islands.\n\nFrom 1981 onward, Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson has composed music for several movies, both Icelandic and foreign, and worked with film directors such as Henning Carlsen (\"Pan\", 1995), Jane Campion (\"In the Cut\", 2003) and Friðrik Þór Friðriksson (\"Brennu-Njálssaga\", 1981 - \"Skytturnar\", 1987 - \"Börn Náttúrunnar\", 1991 - \"Bíódagar\", 1994 - \"Cold Fever\", 1995 - \"Djöflaeyjan\", 1996 - \"Angels of the Universe\", 2000 and \"Falcons\", 2002).\n\nHilmar Örn has received many awards for his contributions as a film composer.

{"id": "2202722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202722", "title": "Geomagnetic excursion", "text": "Geomagnetic excursion\n\nA geomagnetic excursion, like a geomagnetic reversal, is a significant change in the Earth's magnetic field. Unlike reversals, however, an excursion does not permanently change the large-scale orientation of the field, but rather represents a dramatic, typically short-lived change in field intensity, with a variation in pole orientation of up to 45° from the previous position. These events, which typically last a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years, often involve declines in field strength to between 0 and 20% of normal. Excursions, unlike reversals, are generally not recorded around the entire globe. This is partially due to them not being recorded well within the sedimentary record, but also because they likely do not extend through the entire geomagnetic field. One of the first excursions to be studied was the Laschamp event, dated at around years ago. This event was a complete reversal of polarity, however, as it later turned out, though with the reversed field 5% of the normal strength. Since this event has also been seen in sites around the globe, it is suggested as one of the few examples of a truly global excursion.\n\nScientific opinion is divided on what causes geomagnetic excursions. The dominant theory is that they are an inherent aspect of the dynamo processes that maintain the Earth's magnetic field. In computer simulations, it is observed that magnetic field lines can sometimes become tangled and disorganized through the chaotic motions of liquid metal in the Earth's core. In such cases, this spontaneous disorganization can cause decreases in the magnetic field as perceived at the Earth's surface. In truth, under this scenario, the Earth's magnetic field intensity does not significantly change in the core itself, but rather energy is transferred from a dipole configuration to higher order multipole moments which decay more rapidly with the distance from the Earth's core, so that the expression of such a magnetic field at the surface of the Earth would be considerably less, even without significant changes in the strength of the deep field. This scenario is supported by observed tangling and spontaneous disorganizations in the solar magnetic field. However, this process in the sun invariably leads to a reversal of the solar magnetic field (see: solar cycle), and has never been observed such that the field would recover without large scale changes in field orientation.\n\nThe work of David Gubbins suggests that excursions occur when the magnetic field is reversed only within the liquid outer core; reversals occur when the inner core is also affected. This fits well with observations of events within the current chron of reversals taking 3–7000 years to complete, while excursions typically last 500–3000 years. However, this timescale does not hold true for all events, and the need for separate generation of fields has been contested, since the changes can be spontaneously generated in mathematical models.\n\nA minority opinion, held by such figures as Richard A. Muller, is that geomagnetic excursions are not spontaneous processes but rather triggered by external events which directly disrupt the flow in the Earth's core. Such processes may include the arrival of continental slabs carried down into the mantle by the action of plate tectonics at subduction zones, the initiation of new mantle plumes from the core–mantle boundary, and possibly mantle-core shear forces and displacements resulting from very large impact events. Supporters of this theory hold that any of these events lead to a large scale disruption of the dynamo, effectively turning off the geomagnetic field for a period of time necessary for it to recover.\n\nExcept for recent periods of the geologic past, it is not well known how frequently geomagnetic excursions occur. Unlike geomagnetic reversals, which are easily detected by the change in field direction, the relatively short-lived excursions can be easily overlooked in long duration, coarsely resolved, records of past geomagnetic field intensity. Present knowledge suggests that they are around ten times more abundant than reversals, with up to 12 excursions documented within the current reversal period Brunhes–Matuyama reversal.\n\nDue to the weakening of the magnetic field, particularly during the transition period, greater amounts of radiation would be able to reach the Earth, increasing production of beryllium 10 and levels of carbon 14. However, it is likely that nothing serious would occur, as the human species has certainly lived through at least one such event; \"Homo erectus\" and possibly \"Homo heidelbergensis\" lived through the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal with no known ill effect, and excursions are shorter-lived and do not result in permanent changes to the magnetic field. The major hazard to modern society is likely to be similar to those associated with geomagnetic storms, where satellites and power supplies may be damaged, although compass navigation would also be affected. Some forms of life that are thought to navigate based on magnetic fields may be disrupted, but again it is suggested that these species have survived excursions in the past.\nSince excursion periods are not always global, any effect might well only be experienced in certain places, with others relatively unaffected. The time period involved could be as little as a century, or as much as years.\n\nThere is evidence that geomagnetic excursions may be associated with episodes of rapid short-term climatic cooling during periods of continental glaciation (ice ages).\n\nRecent analysis of the geomagnetic reversal frequency, oxygen isotope record, and tectonic plate subduction rate, which are indicators of the changes in the heat flux at the core mantle boundary, climate and plate tectonic activity, shows that all these changes indicate similar rhythms on million years’ timescale in the Cenozoic Era occurring with the common fundamental periodicity of ∼13 Myr during most of the time.\n\nGeomagnetic excursions for the Brunhes geomagnetic chron are relatively well described.\n\nGeomagnetic excursions in the Matuyama, Gauss and Gilbert chrons are also reported and new possible excursions are suggested for these chrons based on analysis of the deep drilling cores from Lake Baikal and their comparison with the oceanic core (ODP) and Chinese loess records.\n\n\n"}

Smith’s journalistic career spans over five decades and his work influenced an entire generation of writers. Smith became the second sports columnist ever to win the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary in 1976. Writing in 1989, sportswriter David Halberstam called Smith \"the greatest sportswriter of the two eras.\" \n\nWalter Wellesley Smith (he began calling himself \"Red\" Smith as he loathed his birth name) was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin on September 25, 1905.\nSmith attended Green Bay East High School, which was site of Packers home games until 1957. Throughout his childhood, Smith enjoyed hiking, hunting, and fishing. After high school, Smith moved on to the University of Notre Dame and graduated in 1927.\n\nAfter graduation, he wrote letters to at least 100 newspapers asking for a job. Finally he was picked up by the \"Milwaukee Sentinel\". Smith then worked for the \"St. Louis Journal\" as a sportswriter. This is where Smith developed his humorous and literate style that made his writing so beloved and respected. After his stint at the St. Louis Journal, Smith worked at the \"Philadelphia Record\" for nine years, from 1936 to 1945.\n\nAfter 18 years, Smith joined the \"New York Herald Tribune\" in 1945. He cemented his reputation with the \"Herald Tribune\", as his column, “Views of Sports”, was widely read and often syndicated. Smith wrote three or four columns a week that were printed by 275 newspapers in the United States and 225 in about 30 foreign nations.\n\nWhen the \"Herald Tribune\" folded in 1966, he became a freelance writer. In 1971, at the age of 66, he was hired by \"The New York Times\" and wrote four columns a week for the next decade, sometimes devoting 18 hours a day to them.\n\nSmith mainly wrote about the sports that interested him such as baseball, football, boxing, and horse racing. He had a distaste for basketball (which he called \"whistleball\") and hockey, and often wrote about one of his passions, fly-fishing, for trout. Many of Smith's fishing stories were written in a self-deprecating manner and he often spoke of how embarrassingly bad he was at it. In 1956, one of Smith’s columns earned him the second Grantland Rice Memorial for outstanding sportswriting. He wrote in a journalistic style and avoided the flowery language and cliches of many sportswriters.\n\nDuring his time with \"The New York Times\", Smith garnered many awards. In 1976, he was the second sportswriter to win the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary, citing \"his commentary on sports in 1975 and for many other years\". He also received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976, which is baseball's highest honor for print journalists. Furthermore, the Associated Press awarded him the first Red Smith Award for \"outstanding contributions to sports journalism\".\n\nSmith's writing abilities and command of the English language made him much sought after as an editor or adviser by dictionary and thesarus publishers.\n\nSmith is best known for his famous quotation, \"Writing is easy. You just open a vein and bleed.\" In 1946, sportswriter Paul Gallico wrote, \"It is only when you open your veins and bleed onto the page a little that you establish contact with your reader.\" In April 1949, columnist Walter Winchell wrote, \"Red Smith was asked if turning out a daily column wasn't quite a chore. ... 'Why, no', dead-panned Red. 'You simply sit down at the typewriter, open your veins, and bleed.'\"\n\nSmith was a strong critic of former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali until late in Ali's career. This was because when Ali refused to serve during the Vietnam War, claiming his case as a conscientious objector, Smith, who had never served in uniform himself, wrote: \"Squealing over the possibility that the military may call him up, Cassius makes himself as sorry a spectacle as those unwashed punks who picket and demonstrate against the war\", and berated Ali for being a \"draft dodger\" and a \"slacker\".\n\nLater Smith famously commented on Ali's first professional defeat in 32 bouts, against Joe Frazier: \"If they fought a dozen times, Joe Frazier would whip Muhammad Ali a dozen times; and it would get easier as it went along\". Ali went on to fight Frazier twice more, winning both times, once by unanimous decision and once by TKO. Before their final match, the 1975 Thrilla in Manila, Smith admitted Ali was both a great fighter and a great man.\n\nSmith was married twice. His first wife died in 1967. Smith then married Phyllis Warner Weiss in 1968. The couple lived in New Canaan, Connecticut and in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Smith had two children, five stepchildren, six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\n\nRed's son, Terence Smith, went on to be a journalist at \"The New York Times\", CBS News, PBS, The Huffington Post, and NPR. The younger Smith went on to win two Emmy Awards. His first Emmy Award was in 1989 for his coverage of people who lived near nuclear power plants; his second Emmy was for his coverage of Hurricane Hugo in 1990.\n\nDuring \"The New York Times\" years, Smith's writing style became shorter, drier, and more concise. He believed that his columns in earlier years had rambled too much and took forever to get to the point. He also became more cynical in his beliefs (\"I used to go too far in holding up athletes as flawless gods\") and in the last years started increasingly criticizing the treatment of players by team owners and management, no doubt motivated by past criticism that he had gone out of his way to justify owners' behavior. He also denounced the International Olympic Committee as a 19th-century relic.\n\nSmith's 4 January 1980 column called for the boycott by the US of the Summer Olympics in Moscow, making him the first sportswriter to do so. President Carter announced a few weeks later that the US would not attend the games that summer, in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nSmith lived the last years of his life in New Canaan, Connecticut. On 11 January 1982, Smith announced that he would cut down to three columns a week, stating that \"We shall see whether the quality improves.\" Four days later, he died of heart failure in Stamford, Connecticut. Smith is buried in Stamford's Long Ridge Union Cemetery.\n\nRed Smith School (4K through 8th grades) in Green Bay, Wisconsin is named in his honor. Also named in his honor is the Red Smith Handicap, a thoroughbred horse race annually run at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York.\n\nSmith realized the significance of sports in the American culture. He once stated the following: “Sports is not really a play world. I think it’s the real world. The people we’re writing about in professional sports, they’re suffering and living and dying and loving, and trying to make their way through life just as the bricklayers and politicians are.” He also said \"It is no coincidence that the largest surviving monument of the ancient Greeks and Romans is the Coliseum in Rome, the Yankees Stadium of its time.\"\n\n\n9. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/549849/Red-Smith\n\n\n"}

The series starred Jack Webb as Pete Kelly and was created by writer Richard L. Breen, who had previously worked with Webb on \"Pat Novak for Hire\"; James Moser and Jo Eisinger wrote most of the other scripts. \n\nSet in Kansas City, Missouri, in the early 1920s, the series was a crime drama with a strong musical atmosphere (Webb was a noted Dixieland jazz enthusiast). Kansas City in this era was a hotbed of jazz, as well as of organized crime and political corruption, all of which influenced the series.\n\nPete Kelly was a musician, a cornet player who headed his own jazz combo, \"Pete Kelly's Big Seven.\" They worked at 417 Cherry Street, a speakeasy run by George Lupo, often mentioned but never heard. Kelly, narrating the series, described Lupo as a \"fat, friendly little guy.\" The plots typically centered on Kelly's reluctant involvement with gangsters, gun molls, FBI agents, and people trying to save their own skins. The endings were often downbeat.\n\nThe supporting cast was minimal; apart from the off-mike character Lupo and occasional speaking parts by the band members (notably Red the bass player, played by Jack Kruschen), the only other regular role of note was Maggie Jackson, the torch singer at another club (Fat Annie's, \"across the river on the Kansas side\"), played by blues singer Meredith Howard. \n\nIn one episode, Bessie Smith is mentioned as the singer at Fat Annie's instead of Maggie Jackson. Boozy ex-bootlegger Barney Ricketts would show up occasionally, an informant not unlike the character Jocko Madigan on Webb and Breen's \"Pat Novak for Hire\". The episodic roles were filled by William Conrad (as various mob bosses), Vic Perrin, and Roy Glenn, among others.\n\nThe music dominated the series. In addition to one song by Maggie Jackson, each episode boasted two jazz numbers by the \"Big Seven.\" The group was actually led by Dick Cathcart, the cornet player who was Pete Kelly's musical stand-in. The other members of the group, all well known jazz musicians, included Matty Matlock on clarinet, Moe Schneider on trombone, piano player Ray Sherman, bass player Morty Corb, guitarist Bill Newman, and drummer Nick Fatool. The show's announcer was another frequent Webb collaborator, George Fenneman, who would open each show with \"This one's about Pete Kelly.\"\n\nThe series lasted only three months, but inspired a 1955 film version of \"Pete Kelly's Blues\", in which Jack Webb produced, directed and starred. It used many of the same musicians, including Cathcart, and Ella Fitzgerald was cast as Maggie Jackson. A lesser-known television version, still produced and directed by Webb but with William Reynolds in the lead, aired in 1959, using scripts originally written for the radio version.\n\nAfter the film, two albums were released, a soundtrack recording and \"Pete Kelly Lets His Hair Down\", an instrumental album using the musicians from the series with songs arranged by tempo - \"blue songs\" and \"red songs\" with names such as \"Peacock,\" '\"Periwinkle,\" \"Midnight,\" \"Rouge,\" \"Flame'\" and '\"Fire Engine.\" This LP was released by Rhino Records as one-half of a Webb compilation disc, \"Just The Tracks, Ma’am\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202731", "title": "Red cabbage", "text": "Red cabbage\n\nThe red cabbage (purple-leaved varieties of \"Brassica oleracea\" Capitata Group) is a kind of cabbage, also known as Blaukraut after preparation. Its leaves are colored dark red/purple. However, the plant changes its color according to the pH value of the soil, due to a pigment belonging to anthocyanins. In acidic soils, the leaves grow more reddish, in neutral soils they will grow more purple, while an alkaline soil will produce rather greenish-yellow coloured cabbages. This explains the fact that the same plant is known by different colours in various regions. Furthermore, the juice of red cabbage can be used as a home-made pH indicator, turning red in acid and green/yellow in basic solutions. It can be found in all Europe, throughout the Americas, in China and especially in Africa.\nOn cooking, red cabbage will normally turn blue. To retain the red color it is necessary to add vinegar or acidic fruit to the pot.\n\nRed cabbage needs well fertilized soil and sufficient humidity to grow. It is a seasonal plant which is seeded in spring and harvested in late fall. Red cabbage is a better keeper than its \"white\" relatives and does not need to be converted to sauerkraut to last the winter.\n\nRed cabbage is often used raw for salads and coleslaw. This vegetable can be eaten cooked. It is the traditional accompanying side dish paired with many German meals, notably meat dishes like Sauerbraten or Döner. At Christmas it can be spiced and served as an accompaniment to seasonal roast goose or turkey. Often apples are added to give it sweet-sour taste.\n\nIt is recommended to start red cabbage seeds indoors 4 weeks before the last frost. Sow in containers that allow for movement of water through the bottom of a cell. Popular seedling starting containers are peat pots, egg cartons, plug trays or milk cartons. Once the seedlings grow to about tall, and have developed their first leaves, they can be hardened off and moved outside for transplanting. Red cabbage prefers climates that remain moist and cool for most of its vegetative growth stage, so they can be placed in the ground shortly after the last frost, while the spring is still cool. The cabbage plants can be spaced about from one another. They will need watering often but are otherwise low maintenance plants.\n\nRed cabbage contains an anthocyanin-based dye that can be used as a pH indicator. It is red, pink, or magenta in acids, (pH < 7), purple in neutral solutions (pH ≈7), and ranges from blue to green to yellow in alkaline solutions (pH > 7).\n\nRed cabbage has a high content of vitamin C and vitamin K, containing 44% and 72%, respectively, of the Daily Value (DV) per 100-gram amount (right table of USDA nutrient values).\n\nBasic research on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates which may stimulate the production of detoxifying enzymes during metabolism. Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, may have protective effects against colon cancer. Cabbage is a source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.\n\n"}

Stoller (born June 5, 1946) is an American self-styled \"intellectual property entrepreneur\" based in suburban Chicago, Illinois. Stoller claimed rights to a large inventory of well-known trademarks and engaged in the assertive enforcement of those alleged trademark rights, threatening infringement action against people and companies who attempt to use similar marks.\n\nThough he managed to obtain license payments in some circumstances through demand letters, Stoller lost some key challenges in federal court, and was sanctioned by United States regulators for filing thousands of motions. A federal court labeled Stoller and his companies as \"vexatious litigants\" in 2005, and his bankruptcy filing from that year was converted to a liquidation in 2006 after the judge found Stoller's filing to have been made in bad faith. On August 8, 2007, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Stoller's trademark assets to the Society for the Prevention of Trademark Abuse, LLC.\n\nStoller's companies included Rentamark.com, Stealth Industries Inc., S Industries Inc., Sentra Sporting Goods U.S.A., and Central Manufacturing Company. Through these companies, Stoller has registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for over 25 years including Stealth, Sentra, Dark Star, Air Frame, Triana, Stradivarius, Havoc, Chestnut, Trillium, White Line Fever, Fire Power, Love Your Body, and many others.\n\nStoller has filed oppositions to others' trademark applications with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) numerous times, and filed applications for extension of the deadline to file such oppositions even more times. Stoller claims a number of large and small companies have resolved trademark controversies. When approaching infringers, Stoller is reported to document his claims with copies of letters which demonstrate capitulation with his demands. Such letters are said to be from companies such as K-Mart, and often marked \"Confidential\".\n\nA list of thousands of proceedings involving Leo Stoller and his companies (Stealth Industries, Inc., Leo Stoller Stealth Industries Inc., Leo Stoller Central Mfg. Co, Central Mfg. Co., Central Mfg. Inc., Sentra Industries Inc.) can be found in the USPTO site.\n\nArticles about Stoller have appeared in \"The New York Times\" and the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". He has been quoted in the \"Wall Street Journal\" and interviewed on Fox News, CBS News and talk radio programs.\n\nIn August 2002 the Illinois Attorney General filed suit against Stoller for illegally soliciting funds on behalf of victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks via his web site giveagiftonline.com. Twelve charities Stoller listed said they never received any money from Stoller, despite assurances on the site that \"100 percent of all donations\" would be forwarded. He was accused of not being a licensed charitable organization and listing charities without their permission. Stoller paid a $2,000 fine and was barred from soliciting for charities in Illinois, but made no admission of wrongdoing.\n\nIn 1996 S Industries, Inc. filed suit alleging that Centra 2000, a producer of data management software, infringed its/Stoller's \"Sentra\" trademark in violation of the Lanham Act. District Judge George W. Lindberg ruled in favor of Centra 2000, finding that S Industries did not hold a federal registration for the \"Sentra\" mark for use on computer hardware or software. Because S Industries' claims were, in the judge's view, completely unfounded and because its procedural maneuvering multiplied the cost of defending against the suit, Centra 2000 was awarded attorney's fees in July 1998. This was affirmed on appeal.\n\nWhen Columbia Pictures brought out the 2005 movie \"Stealth\", Stoller attempted to force the movie studio to change the name of the movie or pay him royalties, but the studio responded by suing Stoller for declarative relief. The court entered a consent judgment and permanent injunction in favor of Columbia Pictures and against Stoller in November 2005. In December 2006, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of Stoller's counterclaims, and the case was closed in January 2007.\n\nA case decided by summary judgment on September 30, 2005, \"Central Manufacturing Co. v. Brett\", pitted a Stoller-owned company against Hall-of-Fame baseball player George Brett, whose company, Brett Brothers Sports International Inc., sells a bat under the name \"Stealth\". It was alleged in this case that the use of that name infringed upon Stoller's trademark rights.\n\nIn its decision, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois determined that there was no likelihood of confusion where consumers would mistakenly regard Brett's bats as being from Stoller's company. The court also found that Stoller failed to provide adequate proof that his company and its licensees had even sold baseball-related merchandise at all. The court found likelihood of confusion in the opposite direction, found Brett's trademark rights to be senior, and hence canceled Stoller's (Central Manufacturing) registration. In the decision, the court described Stoller's tactics and enumerated dozens of unsuccessful infringement cases he had brought in that court.\n\nChief Judge Charles P. Kocoras from the Northern District of Illinois then issued a citation to Stoller after reviewing his \"filing history\" having filed at least \"49 lawsuits in this court, individually or through one of his many wholly owned corporations\". \"The Executive Committee (of the Northern District of Illinois) in its capacity as the supervisor of the assignment of cases, has directed that Leo Stoller inform this court of any claim by him why the Executive Committee should not impose reasonable and necessary restraints upon Mr. Stoller's ability to file civil cases in this District.\" After a thorough review of Leo Stoller's entire filing history the Executive Committee of the Northern District of Illinois issued a decision stating that \"the committee will take no further action in this matter.\"\n\nOn July 9, 2007, in an opinion that opened with a laudatory description of the George Brett \"Pine Tar Incident\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment, including the order for Stoller to pay Brett's attorney fees.\n\nStoller and the \"Central Mfg. Co. (a Delaware corporation)\" sued a fishing tackle company, Pure Fishing, Inc. in February 2005 in Illinois for selling Spiderwire Stealth fishing line. Pure Fishing denied infringement and counterclaimed alleging that Stoller's trademark business violated various state and federal laws against unfair business practices. Pure Fishing also acquired and asserted in another counterclaim (piercing the corporate veil and continuation of business theories) the unsatisfied 1998 sanction judgment that had been awarded to Centra 2000 against Stoller's S Industries, Inc.\nPure Fishing also showed that Stoller had signed his attorney's name to pleadings that were filed with the court. Stoller's case was dismissed with prejudice and default judgments entered against all corporate defendants for lack of prosecution and against Stoller as a sanction under Rule 11.\n\nDuring Stoller's 2006 bankruptcy proceedings (see below), Pure Fishing went back to the district court for entry of a Final Judgment. On October 4, 2006, a federal court in Chicago entered final judgment in \"Central Mfg. Co., et al. v. Pure Fishing, Inc., et al.\" The Court declared the case to be \"exceptional\" under 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) and ordered Central Mfg. to pay Pure Fishing’s costs, charges and disbursements, including a reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in the action. The court further ordered that Stoller and his companies were \"vexatious litigants\" and barred them \"from instituting any lawsuit or trademark opposition without prior leave of this Court pursuant to this Court’s authority under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).\" The court also cancelled the marks asserted in the Complaint. Stoller filed a Notice of Appeal from the October 4 judgment and has moved to stay the enforcement of the said judgment pending the appeals.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, the Court entered judgment in favor of Pure Fishing, Inc. in the total amount of $969,751.81.\n\nStoller filed an opposition with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) in April 2006 to Target Stores bulls-eye logo.\n\nIn 2006, Stoller filed an opposition to Google's attempt at registering a trademark to the name \"Google\" in the category of exercise balls. Stoller claims that the \"Google\" mark has become generic, yet also claims that it infringes on prior alleged rights to the name held by Stoller's company. The case against the Google mark, however, was dismissed with prejudice at the instigation of Stoller's trustee in bankruptcy, who is empowered to take action in all cases in which Stoller and his companies are involved. Subsequently, on January 19, 2007, Google filed a suit against Stoller's companies alleging violations of the anti-racketeering RICO law.\n\nOn April 2, 2008 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a judgment in favor of Google, on the ground that the case had been pursued using contradictory principles, both treating those companies as extensions of Stoller himself, and as separate legal entities. The case was remanded to the lower court for further action. The court noted, however, that Stoller remained subject to an order \"directing that all federal courts in [the Seventh Circuit] return unfiled any papers he submits directly or indirectly unless and until he pays a $10,000 fine we imposed against him in August 2007,\" and \"he will have to pay the outstanding sanction or, as a practical matter, face certain default.\"\n\nOn March 17, 2008, an entity calling itself the \"Stoller Pension and Profit Sharing Plan\" filed Application Serial No. 77/424,372 in the USPTO, claiming trademark rights to the word \"Stealth\" in the fields of boat accessories and various forms of sports equipment and apparel, with a first use in commerce dating back to 1981. This organization has filed a property tort suit against Countrywide Bank.\n\nSeveral jurisdictions have imposed sanctions against Stoller in response to the cases and motions he has brought, and his conduct in prosecuting them.\n\n\nOn March 1, 1985, Stoller filed for Chapter 13 relief in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Case No. 85-02729.\n\nOn March 23, 1998, Stoller filed for bankruptcy in the Northern District of Illinois, Case No. 98-03288 (later withdrawn).\n\nIn 2001, Stoller made a bankruptcy filing for his litigation entity, S Industries, Inc., that was filed during the appeal of the \"S Industries, Inc. v. Centra\" 2000 decision (N.D. Ill. 1998) that had levied sanctions against S Industries for oppressive litigation.\n\nOn December 20, 2005, Stoller filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 13, before a final judgment could be entered in the \"Pure Fishing\" case. His petition listed $183,000 in general unsecured claims. This had the effect of an automatic stay on the litigation. Although the case against the corporate entities might have continued, Judge Lindberg stayed the case against those entities as well \"in view of the unique relationship\" between Stoller and his corporate entities.\nPure Fishing filed a claim in the bankruptcy case and asked the court to convert Stoller's case from Chapter 13 (debtor controlled reorganization) to Chapter 7 (liquidation), with the immediate appointment of a trustee to manage the financial estate. Following a trial on the motion in August 2006, the case was immediately converted with trustee Richard M. Fogel appointed on September 5, 2006. The detailed opinion by Judge Jack B. Schmetterer of the bankruptcy court spells out in great detail how Stoller operated his business. A Notice of Appeal was filed by Stoller, who also moved to stay all proceedings pending resolution of his appeal. Stoller has also moved to disqualify the trustee on the grounds that he is biased and prejudiced against Stoller and not operating within the best interest of the estate. The court denied Stoller's motion, and Stoller's appeal was denied.\n\nOn October 5, 2006, trustee Richard M. Fogel's authority was extended to include actions as sole shareholder of all corporate entities owned or controlled by Stoller, thus relieving Stoller of his ability to act as a representative of his corporations or proprietorships.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, the bankruptcy court approved an auction and sale under which Stoller's trademark assets were transferred to the Society for the Prevention of Trademark Abuse, LLC, the sole bidder in the auction, for $7,500.\n\nOn December 15, 2010, Stoller was indicted on federal fraud charges related to his bankruptcy filings. He was arraigned on January 12, 2011, and a public defender was appointed to represent him. On November 30, 2011, judge Virginia Kendall set a trial date of April 23, 2012. On April 13, Stoller entered into a plea agreement pleading guilty to \"knowingly and fraudulently making a false statement under penalty of perjury in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding,\" in violation of .\n\nIn September 2012, Judge Kendall was revealed to be among the candidates being considered for the position of U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, causing all of her criminal cases to be transferred to other judges to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. As part of the reassignment, Stoller's case was temporarily transferred to U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer; it was returned to Kendall on November 7 after the District Court's Executive committee determined she was no longer under consideration for the appointment. In addition, Stoller's counsel withdrew from representation, and new counsel was appointed. On October 26, Judge Pallmeyer struck the scheduled sentencing hearing and ordered a new status hearing for December 10, 2012 which was subsequently continued by Kendall.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, Stoller filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Judge Kendall denied the motion, calling it \"frivolous\", on October 9.\n\nThe preliminary finding under the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines is a range of 30 to 37 months imprisonment, in addition to any court-imposed supervised release, fine or restitution. The prosecution has asked for Stoller to be sentenced to 37 months in prison, based on Stoller's \"egregious and ceaseless abuse of the federal court system\" and because there is \"nothing about the defendant’s history and characteristics that suggests that he will not re-offend in the future.\" Stoller also agreed to pay restitution under to the bankruptcy estate according to a schedule to be set by the court.\n\nOn November 14, 2014, Judge Kendall sentenced Stoller to 20 months in a federal prison, to be served in a medical facility, as well as a $100 fine. He was ordered to surrender to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on January 16, 2015.\n\nOn November 24, Stoller gave notice that he was appealing the judgment to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Seventh Circuit noted that \"based on prior filings in which he made false representations about his indigency, appellant Leo Stoller is subjected to a filing restriction and is not permitted to proceed \"in forma pauperis\" in any federal court in this circuit,\" and, although the order did not apply to criminal cases, ordered that if Stoller were to attempt to proceed \"in forma pauperis\", he would need to prove eligibility to a United States magistrate judge. In December 2014, Stoller filed a motion to proceed \"in forma pauperis\", and the Court of Appeals referred the matter to Geraldine Soat Brown, United States Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, to make a determination. The court granted the motion on March 5. Oral argument of the appeal was held on December 7, 2015 before circuit judges Joel Flaum, Ann Claire Williams, and Diane Sykes.\n\nStoller was released from prison on May 20, 2016. A month after his release, the Seventh Circuit panel unanimously affirmed his conviction. On July 11, Stoller petitioned the Seventh Circuit for an en banc rehearing. His petition was denied on July 26. On December 16, 2016, Stoller, acting as his own attorney, petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review his case. His petition was denied on February 21, 2017.\n\nIn 2018 Leo Stoller filed a motion asking the district court to clarify whether, as a convicted felon, he could possess archery equipment, BB guns, or pellet guns. The district court dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction. Stoller appealed to the 7th Circuit, which affirmed the district court’s decision in June 2019.\n\n\n"}

It was their first album in seven years, following \"Democracy\" in 1996, and their second self-titled album, following their debut in 1980. The album was produced by Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill and features Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl on drums, a long-time Killing Joke fan. It peaked at number 43 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nVocalist Jaz Coleman and Dave Grohl originally intended to title the album \"Axis of Evil\", in reference to the political lyrical themes: \"It's the beginning of the American Empire. They're taking over the world. That's what's happening, and here we are at the heart of the fucking enemy. I never thought I'd see the day.\" \"The Death & Resurrection Show\", the title of the opening song on the album, was also a working title.\n\nBassist Paul Raven had recently met Grohl, who expressed an interest in working with the band. According to Coleman, \"The original idea was to have three of our favourite drummers play on the album, Dave [Grohl] being one of them. We also wanted John [Dolmayan] from System of a Down and Danny [Carey] from Tool. But when Dave heard the songs, he said, 'I want the whole thing'\". Dolmayan worked with the band during early recording sessions, but the drumming on the final album is entirely by Grohl. Grohl declined to be paid for his work.\n\nDuring the recording of the song \"Asteroid\", Dave Grohl commented on the album:\n\nThe album was produced by Andy Gill of Gang of Four and recorded at his Beauchamp Building studio in London, except for the drums, which were recorded at Grand Master Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nBass guitar is played by original member Youth, guitarist Geordie Walker, and other longtime bassist Paul Raven, who performed on the tour supporting the album. Walker claims to have played \"half the bass on the record. \"\n\nGrohl did not play live with the band; the drummer on the supporting tour was Ted Parsons, formerly of Swans, Prong and Godflesh.\n\nThe album received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Metacritic, it holds an average review score of 79/100, based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".\n\nJoshua Klein of \"Billboard\" awarded the album an 80 out of 100, noting that \"Grohl's furious playing fits perfectly with the wall of rage erected by Joke vocalist Jaz Coleman and fellow founders Geordie Walker on guitar and Youth on bass\". John Robb of Playlouder wrote that the album \"may well be the best rock record you'll hear all year\".\n\nA negative review came from \"Rolling Stone\", who awarded the album 2 stars out of 5 and wrote that \"all the humorless gloom and doom feels oppressive after a while\". \"Q\" also gave a score of 2 out of 5, claiming that the album was \"patchy\".\n\nIn 2005, \"Killing Joke\" was ranked number 355 in \"Rock Hard\" magazine's book of \"The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time\".\n\n\n\n"}

Built in 1738, the house is notable as the only surviving house associated with statesman John Hancock, who lived here for several years as a child. It played a prominent role in the Battle of Lexington and Concord as both Hancock and Samuel Adams, leaders of the colonials, were staying in the house before the battle. The House is operated as a museum by the Lexington Historical Society. It is open weekends starting in mid-April and daily from May 30–October 31. An admission fee is charged.\n\nThe Reverend John Hancock, grandfather of the American revolutionary leader of the same name, purchased this site in 1699. In 1738 he built this two-story timber-frame house. Rev. Hancock's son, Thomas, a wealthy Boston merchant, is said to have financed the construction. The front or main portion of the house consists of the -story structure with central chimney, a short center hall, two rooms on each of the two floors, and an attic. The small rear ell, stories high with gambrel roof, contains a kitchen and tiny study downstairs and two low-studded chambers upstairs. As confirmed by tree-ring dating (dendrochronology), both portions of the house were built from trees felled in the same year, refuting a commonly held belief that the ell was built in 1698. Succeeding Hancock as minister in 1752, the Reverend Jonas Clarke, who reared 12 children in the parsonage, was an eloquent supporter of the colonial cause.\n\nThis house is the only surviving residence associated with John Hancock, famous American patriot, President of the Continental Congress, first signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It became his boyhood home in 1744 when, upon the death of his father at Quincy, the seven-year-old boy came to live at this house with his grandfather. In 1750 John joined his childless uncle, Thomas Hancock, a wealthy Boston merchant who adopted him.\n\nOn the evening of April 18, 1775, John Hancock and Samuel Adams, having attended the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in Concord and wary of returning to Boston, were guests of Rev. Clarke. Fearing that they might be captured by the British, Dr. Joseph Warren of Boston dispatched William Dawes and Paul Revere to Lexington with news of the advancing British troops. Arriving separately, they stopped to warn Hancock and Adams around midnight, then set off for Concord. Hancock and Adams made their way to Burlington to avoid capture.\n\nThe house remained in the Clarke family until 1844, maintained by Rev. Clarke's daughters. It thereafter changed hands several times before being acquired by the Lexington Historical Society.

His grandfather, Jeremiah, was his earliest and most influential role model, as he was college educated and continually encouraged the young Jimmie Lee to excel academically. \n\nSolomon is a graduate of Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas, holds a Harvard law degree and earned a Bachelor of Arts at Dartmouth College. He played for the Dartmouth football team and was also an All-Ivy League sprinter.\n\nSolomon became MLB's Director of Minor League Operations in 1991. He subsequently was promoted to Executive Director of Minor League Operations and then to Senior VP of Baseball Operations. He oversaw major, minor and international baseball operations; the MLB scouting bureau, the Arizona Fall League, and numerous special projects, including the launching of the MLB Youth Academy at Compton College, California.\n\nThe All-Star Futures Game was conceived by Solomon. Looking for an event to showcase the minor leagues and round out the All-Star week festivities, Solomon looked at the National Basketball Association rookie game and the National Football League's rookie flag football game and thought of the idea. Since 1999, the Futures Game has become a big event for teams' player development departments, a coveted resume filler for players and programming for ESPN2. Rosters for the Futures Game are selected by \"Baseball America\" magazine, in conjunction with MLB and the 30 clubs. Every organization is represented, with no more than two players from any organization. In 2003, Solomon was included in \"Sports Illustrated\"s list of the \"101 Most Influential Minorities in Sports\".\n\nSolomon was named Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations on June 1, 2005. Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement in a press release. As executive VP, Solomon was responsible for such additional areas as on-field discipline, security, and management of facilities.\n\nSolomon's biggest project is the construction of baseball academies in urban areas. Currently there are academies in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and throughout Latin America. This is where young Latino prospects are discovered and trained. Seeing the level of success that Latinos are experiencing in baseball, Solomon decided to bring the academies to United States and he is currently working with major league teams, encouraging them to build academies in large American cities to reintroduce baseball to urban children. On August 7, 2007, Solomon was in attendance during the game which Barry Bonds broke the all-time home run record previously held by Hank Aaron in place of Selig.\n\nIn June 2010, Solomon became MLB's executive vice president for baseball development, putting him in control of academies in the United States and Puerto Rico run by MLB, minor league operations and the Civil Rights Game held annually. \n\nSolomon resigned from his role with Major League Baseball in June 12.

{"id": "2202809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202809", "title": "SS Raifuku Maru", "text": "SS Raifuku Maru\n\nThe was a Japanese cargo ship, which was built in 1918 at Kawasaki Dockyard in Kobe, Japan, and owned by Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd.. In April 1925, it sank in a heavy storm during a voyage from Boston, USA, to Hamburg, Germany, with a cargo of wheat and a crew of thirty-eight, all of whom were lost.\n\nThe \"Raifuku Maru\" had sailed out of Boston on 18 April 1925. On 21 April, it sailed into a heavy storm, and the cargo of wheat began to shift, causing the ship to take on an increasing list to one side. The RMS \"Homeric\", a liner of the White Star Line, and several other vessels received the following communication from the Japanese ship's wireless operator, Masao Hiwatari: \"Now very danger! Come quick!\" Despite the broken English of the Japanese crewmen, it was obvious that the vessel was in trouble. The \"Homeric\" (along with the British vessel \"King Alexander\") tried desperately to reach the \"Raifuku Maru\", but was unable to get close enough to rescue any crew due to the rough seas. The vessel was listing at a 30-degree angle, and sank with all hands while the \"Homeric\"s crew and passengers watched. The \"Homeric\" sent the following message to the Camperdown Signal Station: \"OBSERVED STEAMER RAIFUKU MARU SINK IN LAT 4143N LONG 6139W REGRET UNABLE TO SAVE ANY LIVES.\" Several vessels attempted to locate bodies or survivors from the ship in the days after the sinking, but found none.\n\nThe incident was quite controversial at the time; when the \"Homeric\" arrived in New York, several of the passengers publicly accused the crew of the \"Homeric\" of not making enough effort to save the \"Raifuku Maru\"s crewmen. This was taken up by the Japanese government, who accused the English captains of racism for not saving their crewmen. However this was strenuously denied by the crew of the \"Homeric\" and the White Star Line who argued that they had made every effort to rescue the crew.\n\nSeveral early reports of the incident, including those of the Associated Press, claimed that Hiwatari sent a frantic message reading \"Danger like dagger now!\" The source of this quote is unknown, since it isn't included in radio logs or official records of the incident, but appears in many early accounts of the \"Raifuku Maru\"'s sinking. Divorced of its original context, the \"dagger\" comment became the basis for a popular legend that the ship disappeared without a trace after sending the message. Later writers speculated over what the \"dagger\" was (with waterspouts and UFOs frequently blamed), and the incident became remembered as a genuine mystery of the sea. Popular writers on the Bermuda Triangle, specifically Charles Berlitz and Richard Winer, propagated the myth of the vessel's \"mysterious\" sinking.\n\n"}
{"id": "2202811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202811", "title": "Science fiction magazine", "text": "Science fiction magazine\n\nA science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard-copy periodical format or on the Internet.\nScience fiction magazines traditionally featured speculative fiction in short story, novelette, novella or (usually serialized) novel form, a format that continues into the present day. Many also contain editorials, book reviews or articles, and some also include stories in the fantasy and horror genres.\nMalcolm Edwards and Peter Nicholls write that early magazines were not known as science fiction: \"if there were any need to differentiate them, the terms scientific romance or 'different stories' might be used, but until the appearance of a magazine specifically devoted to sf there was no need of a label to describe the category. The first specialized English-language pulps with a leaning towards the fantastic were \"Thrill Book\" (1919) and \"Weird Tales\" (1923), but the editorial policy of both was aimed much more towards weird-occult fiction than towards sf.\"\n\nMajor American science fiction magazines include \"Amazing Stories\", \"Astounding Science Fiction\", \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\" and \"Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine\". The most influential British science fiction magazine was \"New Worlds\"; newer British SF magazines include \"Interzone\" and \"Polluto\". Many science fiction magazines have been published in languages other than English, but none has gained worldwide recognition or influence in the world of anglophone science fiction.\n\nThere is a growing trend toward important work being published first on the Internet, both for reasons of economics and access. A web-only publication can cost as little as one-tenth of the cost of publishing a print magazine, and as a result, some believe the e-zines are more innovative and take greater risks with material. Moreover, the magazine is internationally accessible, and distribution is not an issue—though obscurity may be. Magazines like \"Strange Horizons\", \"Ideomancer\", \"InterGalactic Medicine Show\", \"Jim Baen's Universe\", and the Australian magazine \"Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine\" are examples of successful Internet magazines. (Andromeda provides copies electronically or on paper.)\n\nWeb-based magazines tend to favor shorter stories and articles that are easily read on a screen, and many of them pay little or nothing to the authors, thus limiting their universe of contributors. However, multiple web-based magazines are listed as \"paying markets\" by the SFWA, which means that they pay the \"professional\" rate of 8c/word or more. These magazines include popular titles such as \"Strange Horizons\", \"InterGalactic Medicine Show,\" and \"Clarkesworld Magazine.\" The SFWA publishes a list of qualifying magazine and short fiction venues that contains all current web-based qualifying markets.\n\nThe World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) awarded a Hugo Award each year to the best science fiction magazine, until that award was changed to one for Best Editor in the early 1970s; the Best Semi-Professional Magazine award can go to either a news-oriented magazine or a small press fiction magazine.\n\nMagazines were the only way to publish science fiction until about 1950, when large mainstream publishers began issuing science fiction books. Today, there are relatively few paper-based science fiction magazines, and most printed science fiction appears first in book form. Science fiction magazines began in the United States, but there were several major British magazines and science fiction magazines that have been published around the world, for example in France and Argentina.\n\nThe first science fiction magazine, \"Amazing Stories\", was published in a format known as bedsheet, roughly the size of Life but with a square spine. Later, most magazines changed to the pulp magazine format, roughly the size of comic books or \"National Geographic\" but again with a square spine. Now, most magazines are published in digest format, roughly the size of \"Reader's Digest\", although a few are in the standard roughly 8.5\" x 11\" size, and often have stapled spines, rather than glued square spines. Science fiction magazines in this format often feature non-fiction media coverage in addition to the fiction. Knowledge of these formats is an asset when locating magazines in libraries and collections where magazines are usually shelved according to size.\n\nThe premiere issue of \"Amazing Stories\" (April 1926), edited and published by Hugo Gernsback, displayed a cover by Frank R. Paul illustrating \"Off on a Comet\" by Jules Verne. After many minor changes in title and major changes in format, policy and publisher, \"Amazing Stories\" ended January 2005 after 607 issues.\n\nExcept for the last issue of \"Stirring Science Stories\", the last true bedsheet size sf (and fantasy) magazine was \"Fantastic Adventures\", in 1939, but it quickly changed to the pulp size, and it was later absorbed by its digest-sized stablemate \"Fantastic\" in 1953. Before that consolidation, it ran 128 issues.\n\nMuch fiction published in these bedsheet magazines, except for classic reprints by writers such as H. G. Wells, Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe, is only of antiquarian interest. Some of it was written by teenage science fiction fans, who were paid little or nothing for their efforts. Jack Williamson for example, was 19 when he sold his first story to \"Amazing Stories\". His writing improved greatly over time, and until his death in 2006, he was still a publishing writer at age 98.\n\nSome of the stories in the early issues were by scientists or doctors who knew little or nothing about writing fiction, but who tried their best, for example, Dr. David H. Keller. Probably the two best original sf stories ever published in a bedsheet science fiction magazine were \"A Martian Odyssey\" by Stanley G. Weinbaum and \"The Gostak and the Doshes\" by Dr. Miles Breuer, who influenced Jack Williamson. \"The Gostak and the Doshes\" is one of the few stories from that era still widely read today. Other stories of interest from the bedsheet magazines include the first Buck Rogers story\", Armageddon 2419 A.D\", by Philip Francis Nowlan, and \"The Skylark of\" S\"pace\" by coauthors E. E. Smith and Mrs. Lee Hawkins Garby, both in \"Amazing Stories\" in 1928.\n\nThere have been a few unsuccessful attempts to revive the bedsheet size using better quality paper, notably \"Science-Fiction Plus\" edited by Hugo Gernsback (1952–53, eight issues). \"Astounding\" on two occasions briefly attempted to revive the bedsheet size, with 16 bedsheet issues in 1942–1943 and 25 bedsheet issues (as \"Analog\", including the first publication of Frank Herbert's \"Dune\") in 1963–1965. The fantasy magazine \"Unknown\", also edited by John W. Campbell, changed its name to \"Unknown Worlds\" and published ten bedsheet-size issues before returning to pulp size for its final four issues. \"Amazing Stories\" published 36 bedsheet size issues in 1991–1999, and its last three issues were bedsheet size, 2004–2005.\n\n\"Astounding Stories\" began in January 1930. After several changes in name and format (\"Astounding Science Fiction\", \"Analog Science Fact & Fiction\", \"Analog\") it is still published today (though it ceased to be pulp format in 1943). Its most important editor, John W. Campbell, Jr., is credited with turning science fiction away from adventure stories on alien planets and toward well-written, scientifically literate stories with better characterization than in previous pulp science fiction. Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy and Robert A. Heinlein's Future History in the 1940s, Hal Clement's \"Mission of Gravity\" in the 1950s, and Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" in the 1960s, and many other science fiction classics all first appeared under Campbell's editorship.\n\nBy 1955, the pulp era was over, and some pulp magazines changed to digest size. Printed adventure stories with colorful heroes were relegated to the comic books. This same period saw the end of radio adventure drama (in the United States). Later attempts to revive both pulp fiction and radio adventure have met with very limited success, but both enjoy a nostalgic following who collect the old magazines and radio programs. Many characters, most notably The Shadow, were popular both in pulp magazines and on radio.\n\nMost pulp science fiction consisted of adventure stories transplanted, without much thought, to alien planets. Pulp science fiction is known for clichés such as stereotypical female characters, unrealistic gadgetry, and fantastic monsters of various kinds. However, many classic stories were first published in pulp magazines. For example, in the year 1939, all of the following renowned authors sold their first professional science fiction story to magazines specializing in pulp science fiction: Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Alfred Bester, Fritz Leiber, A. E. van Vogt and Theodore Sturgeon. These were among the most important science fiction writers of the pulp era, and all are still read today.\n\nAfter the pulp era, digest size magazines dominated the newsstand. The first sf magazine to change to digest size was \"Astounding\", in 1943. Other major digests, which published more literary science fiction, were \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\", \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" and \"If\". Under the editorship of Cele Goldsmith, \"Amazing\" and \"Fantastic\" changed in notable part from pulp style adventure stories to literary science fiction and fantasy. Goldsmith published the first professionally published stories by Roger Zelazny (not counting student fiction in \"Literary Cavalcade\"), Keith Laumer, Thomas M. Disch, Sonya Dorman and Ursula K. Le Guin.\n\nThere was also no shortage of digests that continued the pulp tradition of hastily written adventure stories set on other planets. \"Other Worlds\" and \"Imaginative Tales\" had no literary pretensions. The major pulp writers, such as Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, continued to write for the digests, and a new generation of writers, such as Algis Budrys and Walter M. Miller, Jr., sold their most famous stories to the digests. \"A Canticle for Leibowitz,\" written by Walter M. Miller, Jr., was first published in \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\".\n\nMost digest magazines began in the 1950s, in the years between the film \"Destination Moon\", the first major science fiction film in a decade, and the launching of Sputnik, which sparked a new interest in space travel as a real possibility. Most survived only a few issues. By 1960, in the United States, there were only six sf digests on newsstands, in 1970 there were seven, in 1980 there were five, in 1990 only four and in 2000 only three.\n\nThe first British science fiction magazine was \"Tales of Wonder\", pulp size, 1937–1942, 16 issues, (unless you count \"Scoops\", a tabloid boys' paper that published 20 weekly issues in 1934). It was followed by two magazines, both named \"Fantasy\", one pulp size publishing three issues in 1938–1939, the other digest size, publishing three issues in 1946–1947. The British science fiction magazine, \"New Worlds\", published three pulp size issues in 1946–1947, before changing to digest size. With these exceptions, the pulp phenomenon, like the comic book, was largely a US format. By 2007, the only surviving major British science fiction magazine is \"Interzone\", published in \"magazine\" format, although small press titles such as \"PostScripts\" and \"Polluto\" are available.\n\nDuring recent decades, the circulation of all digest science fiction magazines has steadily decreased. New formats were attempted, most notably the slick-paper stapled magazine format, the paperback format and the webzine. There are also various semi-professional magazines which persist on sales of a few thousand copies but often publish important fiction.\n\nAs the circulation of the traditional US science fiction magazines has declined, new magazines have sprung up online from international small-press publishers. An editor on the staff of \"Science Fiction World\", China's longest-running science fiction magazine, claimed in 2009 that, with \"a circulation of 300,000 copies per issue,\" it was \"the World's most-read SF periodical,\" although subsequent news suggests that circulation dropped precipitously after the firing of its chief editor in 2010 and the departure of other editors. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America lists science fiction periodicals that pay enough to be considered professional markets.\n\nFor a complete list, including defunct magazines, see List of science fiction magazines.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral sources give updates on the state of science fiction magazines. Gardner Dozois presents a summary of the state of magazines in the introduction to the annual \"The Year's Best Science Fiction\" volume. \"Locus\" lists the circulation and discusses the status of pro and semi-pro SF magazines in their February year-in-review issue, and runs periodic summaries of non-US science fiction.\n\n\n"}

It focuses on Rick Grimes, a Kentucky deputy who is shot in the line of duty and awakens from a coma in a zombie apocalypse that has resulted in a state-wide quarantine. After joining with some other survivors, he gradually takes on the role of leader of a community as it struggles to survive the zombie apocalypse. Published beginning in 2003 by Image Comics, the series ran for 193 issues, with Kirkman unexpectedly ending the series in 2019.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" received the 2007 and 2010 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series at San Diego Comic-Con International. The series was adapted into the AMC television series \"The Walking Dead\", which premiered in 2010. The television program loosely follows the storyline of the comic book. The franchise has also spawned multiple additional media properties, including video games (such as \"The Walking Dead\" video game), a companion television series (\"Fear the Walking Dead\"), webisode series (\"\", \"\", \"\", and \"The Walking Dead: Red Machete\"), and various additional publications, including novels (\"\").\n\nThe original pitch by Kirkman and Moore was for a followup to George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\", with the series taking place in the 1960s. Image Comics co-founder Jim Valentino suggested using an original concept instead so the creators would own the property outright. The revised pitch became \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" debuted in 2003, published by Image Comics, with art by Tony Moore for the first six issues and Cliff Rathburn shading the art after issue #5. Charlie Adlard took over as artist on issue #7, after he was approached by Kirkman. Moore also created the cover art for the first 24 issues and the first four trade paperbacks. The remainder were done by Adlard.\n\nWhen the television series premiered in October 2010, Image Comics announced \"The Walking Dead Weekly\". The first 52 issues of the series began to be reprinted on January 5, 2011, with one issue per week for a year.\n\nThe series is periodically re-published in trade paperbacks which contain six issues each, hardcover books with twelve issues and occasional bonus material, omnibus editions of twenty-four issues, and compendium editions of forty-eight issues.\n\nIn May 2018, Image Comics and its imprint Skybound Entertainment, the company that has driven development of \"The Walking Dead\" comic series since 2010, jointly announced The Walking Dead Day. The fan-oriented event has a scheduled date of October 13, 2018 and will coincide with the release of a \"Walking Dead #1 15th Anniversary Variant Edition,\" with cover art by Charlie Adlard. A select number of \"The Walking Dead Day\" participating local comic shops become part of the comic's story line, with their own special edition of Adlard's anniversary cover, featuring the store's logo incorporated into the cover art. The company also noted that additional limited edition collectibles and festivities would be announced at a future date, prior to the October 2018 event.\n\nOn July 3, 2019, Kirkman confirmed through the \"Letters Hacks\" section of issue #193 that the issue would conclude the series, with no previous announcements or warnings beforehand. Kirkman opted to end the comic on his own terms; he stated in his letter in issue #193 that part of the reason to end was that he feared he lacked material to continue the series for several more issues. He had envisioned the series to end around the time that Rick Grimes and his allies reach the Commonwealth, a large human community protected from the walkers, as this would allow him to give a complete arc. However, he found he got there too soon in terms of issues, with the Commonwealth first appearing around issue #150, and Kirkman feared there was no way he could get to an issue #300 with what ideas he had left. This ending came following the death of Rick Grimes, in issue #192. Kirkman kept the series' end a secret as he worked with Adlard to create cover art and solicitation information for Diamond Comic Distributors for non-existent issues through #196 that would have been released through October 2019, creating a storyline that hinted at the death of Carl Grimes, Rick's son, in the wake of Rick's death. Kirkman said that \"The Walking Dead\" comic was always built on surprise, and felt that it was necessary to surprise readers with the end of the series after covering enough of the aftermath of Rick's death in issues #192 and #193.\n\nVolume 1: Days Gone Bye (Issues 1–6)\nVolume 2: Miles Behind Us (Issues 7–12)\nVolume 3: Safety Behind Bars (Issues 13–18)\nVolume 4: The Heart's Desire (Issues 19–24)\nVolume 5: The Best Defense (Issues 25–30)\nVolume 6: This Sorrowful Life (Issues 31–36)\nVolume 7: The Calm Before (Issues 37–42)\nVolume 8: Made to Suffer (Issues 43–48)\nVolume 9: Here We Remain (Issues 49–54)\nVolume 10: What We Become (Issues 55–60)\nVolume 11: Fear the Hunters (Issues 61–66)\nVolume 12: Life Among Them (Issues 67–72)\nVolume 13: Too Far Gone (Issues 73–78)\nVolume 14: No Way Out (Issues 79–84)\nVolume 15: We Find Ourselves (Issues 85–90)\nVolume 16: A Larger World (Issues 91–96)\nVolume 17: Something to Fear (Issues 97–102)\nVolume 18: What Comes After (Issues 103–108)\nVolume 19: March to War (Issues 109–114)\nVolume 20: All Out War (Part One) (Issues 115–120)\nVolume 21: All Out War (Part Two) (Issues 121–126)\nVolume 22: A New Beginning (Issues 127–132)\nVolume 23: Whispers Into Screams (Issues 133–138)\nVolume 24: Life and Death (Issues 139–144)\nVolume 25: No Turning Back (Issues 145–150)\nVolume 26: Call to Arms (Issues 151–156)\nVolume 27: The Whisperer War (Issues 157–162)\nVolume 28: A Certain Doom (Issues 163–168)\nVolume 29: Lines We Cross (Issues 169–174)\nVolume 30: New World Order (Issues 175–180)\nVolume 31: The Rotten Core (Issues 181–186)\nVolume 32: Rest in Peace (Issues 187–193)\n\nMichonne Special (March 16, 2012)\nThe Governor Special (February 13, 2013)\nFree Comic Book Day Special (May 4, 2013)\nMorgan Special (May 5, 2013)\nTyreese Special (October 9, 2013)\nThe Walking Dead: The Alien (April 20, 2016)\nHere's Negan (April 27, 2016 – July 26, 2017, October 4, 2017 (Hardcover))\n\nRick Grimes is the protagonist, a deputy who is comatose when the zombie apocalypse begins.

Lori and Carl form friendships with other survivors such as Carol and Sophia.\n\nAfter leaving the camp, Rick gains a right-hand man and close friendship in Tyreese, who is accompanied by his daughter and her boyfriend. They soon find a farm run by Hershel Greene. Among Hershel's seven children is Maggie Greene, who forms a relationship with Glenn. As the group settle at a prison, they become conflicted with a group of surviving prisoners. Otis meets a katana-wielding survivor named Michonne, who is brought into the group, but struggles to acclimate, facing her own demons. Michonne, Rick and Glenn are later held in captivity by The Governor, a leader of a town called Woodbury who plan to take over the prison. Other Woodbury residents include Alice Warren, who changes sides to Rick's group and delivers Lori's baby, Bob Stookey, an army medic responsible for saving The Governor's life and Lilly, one of The Governor's soldiers.\n\nAfter the prison assault, the remaining survivors regroup at Hershel's farm, and meet Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter and Rosita Espinosa. The group travel to Washington DC where they are hunted by Chris, encounter Gabriel Stokes, a priest, and are then recruited by Aaron and Eric to join the Alexandria Safe-Zone, a city run by congressman Douglas Monroe. Among the residents are Heath and Dr. Denise Cloyd, who quickly become close allies to the core group, and eventually the conflicted Nicholas. Douglas's son, Spencer tries to form a relationship with Andrea. Rick falls in love with Jessie Anderson, an abused wife. Abraham forms a relationship with Holly, a member of the construction crew.\n\nA group of men, known as The Scavengers, tries to conquer Alexandria; the fight attracts a pack of walkers that invades the safe zone, which led to the death of many Alexandrians. After this, Rick and Andrea form a long-standing relationship.\n\nLater, the safe zone starts a trading network with the Hilltop Colony, with help from its scout Paul \"Jesus\" Monroe. \nHowever, their safety is again threatened by the psychopathic Negan and his group known as The Saviors, who reside in a factory. The Hilltop and Alexandria join with The Kingdom, which is run by King Ezekiel, in a war against the Saviors. The war ends thanks to Dwight,a savior who decided to betray Negan.\n\nAfter the war, newcomers such as Magna and Dante are introduced into the series. Another community (Oceanside) out at sea is established, as well as safety perimeters across the DC area, which are violated by the presence of the Whisperers, a tribe of people disguised as the dead who have rejected the notion of re-establishing civilization. The leader, Alpha, antagonizes Rick as her daughter, Lydia, forms a sexual relationship with Carl. When Alpha's second in command, Beta, takes leadership of the group, he declares war against the communities.\n\nRick's group classifies the undead as either walkers, roamers or lurkers, the former being more likely to venture toward a loud noise in search of human prey. Other names have been used by characters in the series, including biters and stinkers. The undead follow and mimic each other, which can result in enormous hordes travelling together, \"walking nonstop, following a sound they've all forgotten,\" as Abraham puts it. When asked about the origins of zombies, Kirkman claimed that there was an answer but that it was unimportant to the story-line. At the same time, it was reported that when Kirkman pitched the series he had claimed that the virus was an alien biological attack in preparation of a full-scale invasion but that he had no intention of following this idea. In 2020, after the end of the series, he confirmed over Twitter that the condition had been caused by a \"space spore.\"\n\nThe series received critical acclaim, winning the Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series in 2010 and prompting Eric Sunde of IGN comics to call it \"one of the best monthly comics available\". Among its fans are author Max Brooks. Because of the popularity of the series, which increased considerably when it was adapted into a television series of the same name, artist Tony Moore's original artwork for the series' early issues has gone up in value; on the March 28, 2013 episode of the VH1 reality television series \"For What It's Worth\", Moore's original artwork for Page 7 of issue #1 was professionally appraised to be worth $20,000.\n\nAMC picked up the rights to produce a show based on the comic in 2009. It ordered a pilot episode on January 21, 2010 and began filming on May 15, 2010. The series premiered on October 31, 2010 with high ratings. On November 8, 2010, after broadcasting two episodes, AMC renewed \"The Walking Dead\" for a second season of 13 episodes, which began on October 16, 2011. The TV show is loosely inspired by the comic, introducing new characters and deviating from the comic in certain plot points.\n\nThe fifth season premiered on October 12, 2014, with Scott M. Gimple as the show's third showrunner. Gimple has said that he would stay closer in line to the comic book series events \"as much as possible\", but ultimately remix stories with certain characters, referencing original characters introduced to the show and deceased characters alive in the comic book as a reason for this. Robert Kirkman himself has mentioned that the series will follow much closer to the comic series with Gimple's run. With the series' ninth season, which started broadcast in October 2018, Angela Kang was promoted to showrunner with Gimple now in charge of all \"Walking Dead\" properties at AMC. This also was accompanied by the largest deviation from the comics, with the departure of Rick Grimes, played by Andrew Lincoln, from the show, though Lincoln will reprise Rick in three feature-length films to be produced as AMC Originals that continue Rick's story with Kirkman's involvement.\n\nA companion television series, titled \"Fear the Walking Dead\", debuted on AMC on August 23, 2015. The series features new original characters, and it is set in the city of Los Angeles, California starting prior to the zombie apocalypse. It explores these new characters as the apocalypse begins. The series was created by Robert Kirkman and Dave Erickson, with Erickson serving as showrunner for the series. AMC ordered the series for a two-season commitment, with the first season consisting of six episodes.\n\nAMC released an animated short of the first part of Issue No. 1 of the comic with animation by Juice Films, voice acting by Phil LaMarr and art by Tony Moore.\n\nTelltale Games, an adventure game developer, secured the rights with Kirkman to make an episodic video game inspired by \"The Walking Dead\" comic book series in 2011. While video games have frequently dealt with the zombie genre, Kirkman said of Telltale's game that \"it [focuses] more on characterization and emotion than action\". Telltale opted to take a new approach to the typical adventure game, making it so that players would have to make decisions through conversation trees or through quick time events, that would propagate through the episode and as determinants into future ones, as to give more weight to the character-driven nature of their game.\n\nTelltale's game, \"The Walking Dead\", first released in 2012, and followed the characters of Lee Everett, a former teacher convicted of murder, and Clementine, a pre-teen girl left alone at the start of the zombie apocalypse; it contained tie-ins with the comic by brief appearances of Glenn Rhee and Hershel Greene, narratively prior to their first appearances in the comic series. The series was a critical success, with much of the praise for the characterization of Clementine and Lee, and is stated to have caused a resurgence in the waning adventure game market since 2000. Telltale went on to develop a full-fleded series, with three additional seasons, additional downloadable content for the first season, and a spin-off title based on Michonne. In all but this spin-off, choices made by players in earlier games continued to set determinants used in later games as the stories followed Clementine's continued struggles to survive as she grows up in the years that followed.\n\nIn the midst of releasing the planned during 2018, Telltale Games went into bankruptcy, laying off the bulk of the staff and cancelling all projects, including the last two episodes of \"The Walking Dead\". By this point, Kirkman had established Skybound Entertainment and had been eyeing a gaming division. He took the opportunity to secure the rights of Telltale's \"The Walking Dead\" properties, and temporarily hired most of the staff that were working on the game so that the series could be finished as well as to close out Clementine's story, which he felt needed to be done. Additionally, with these rights, Skybound took over future publication of Telltale's series, and will publish a remastered version of all four seasons and additional content, featuring graphical improvements that Telltale had made ahead of starting the fourth season.\n\nIn January 2016, the Kings of War creator Mantic Games announced plans to release a tabletop miniature wargame based on The Walking Dead, named \"The Walking Dead: All Out War\". The miniatures game was funded through the popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter. This product is available for order and first began shipping to backers on November 7, 2016.\n\nA series of novels based on the comics, written by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga, were released between 2011 and 2014 focusing on the antagonist \"The Governor\". Taking place in the initial outbreak, the books chronicle his experiences from surviving in the newly ravaged world to the establishment of himself as leader of Woodbury, and finally tying up the conclusion to the prison arc storyline in the comics.\n\nFollowing \"\", Bonansinga continued the \"Walking Dead\" novels as sole author, with Kirkman's name affixed to the title.\n\nThe series has so far been assembled into the following collections:\n\nThe trade paperbacks collect story arcs of six issues each, but contain only the story and none of the original cover art from the comics. Each paperback follows the convention of having a three-word title. The zombies in the cover art for each paperback form part of a larger image if placed end to end. This also loops, as the final zombie on Volume 32 connects to the first on Volume 1.\n\nEach story arc is re-released in hardcover books containing two, omnibus editions containing four, and compendiums containing eight story arcs.\n\nAll hardcovers contain the contents of the comics, including the covers, and in some cases bonus material. The books' trim size is larger than the paperbacks. Each hardcover contains two story arcs from the series. Signed versions of the books are available, each limited to 310 pieces.\n\nLimited omnibus editions collect roughly 24 issues in a slipcase with several extras. The first volume is autographed by Kirkman and Adlard, with 300 copies printed. Subsequent volumes had print runs of 3000 each, along with deluxe limited editions (signed by Kirkman/Adlard) of 300 copies.\n\nSoftcover compendium editions collect approximately 48 comic issues each. They are also available as limited hardcover editions (Red Foil Version for Compendium 1, Gold Foil Version for Compendium 2, and Gold Foil Version for Compendium 3).\n\nSeveral ancillary books and a special edition have also been published:\n\n"}

{"id": "2202827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202827", "title": "Willem Oltmans", "text": "Willem Oltmans\n\nWillem Leonard Oltmans (10 June 1925 – 30 September 2004) was a Dutch investigative journalist and author who did not hesitate to pro-actively intervene in international politics.\n\nDue to the highly critical and opposite stance he often took towards Dutch global politics, as of 1956 the Dutch government conspired to keep him out of work. A lengthy lawsuit (1991–2000) involving the Royal family led to the state having to pay him damages. An erudite orator, the straightforward and uncompromising Oltmans was a striking character in Dutch society.\nOltmans was born into a wealthy family with roots in the Dutch East Indies. During the Second World War he was a member of the Dutch Resistance. \"We blew up a German train,\" Oltmans told the Dutch daily \"Reformatorisch Dagblad\" in 2003 \"Hitler called me a terrorist, but I saw myself as a freedom fighter.\"\n\nHe studied at the prestigious Nyenrode Business University (1946) and Yale University (1948), without graduating. Originally intent on a career with the diplomatic corps of the foreign service, he ended up working in press offices in the Netherlands (1953–1955). He married in 1955 and worked as a freelance reporter in Rome in 1956. There he befriended Indonesian president Sukarno, which started his remarkable career as a controversial journalist.\n\nConvinced that a well connected and informed individual could play a decisive role in the international political arena, he assumed a pro-active part in global political developments, becoming both a news reporter and news maker.\n\nAgainst the will of the Dutch government, Oltmans interviewed Indonesian president Sukarno in 1956. Once he became a confidant of Sukarno and part of his inner circle he took it upon himself to convince the broader public in the Netherlands of the legitimacy of Sukarno's viewpoints. In 1957 he pleaded for the transfer of Dutch New Guinea to Indonesia while in Indonesia. He claimed to have prevented a Dutch war against Indonesia over New Guinea by sending a memo to US president Kennedy. Subsequently Joseph Luns, Minister of Foreign Affairs, covertly tried everything to sabotage Oltmans' career, with considerable success: for a long time, Oltmans was forced to live off welfare. Luns, who now had become Oltmans' nemesis, called him a 'one engine mosquito'. In 1995 Oltmans published his book \"My friend Sukarno\".\n\nHe fought a long lawsuit (1991–2000) against the Dutch state, which he eventually won. In 2000 a commission awarded him eight million guilders (four million dollars) in damages, after taxes. Having paid two million guilders in lawyer's fees, Oltmans bought a penthouse on a canal in Amsterdam and a Steinway piano.\n\nOltmans was based in the USA in the 1960s, where he worked as a reporter for Dutch TV broadcaster NOS and established ties to President Kennedy's closest circle of advisors. After Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in 1963, Oltmans interviewed the mother of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, Marguerite. Further investigation led him to Oswald's acquaintance George de Mohrenschildt. On 15 October 1967, Oltmans interviewed the de Mohrenschildts for NOS which resulted in a 40 minute film that was the only full-length filmed interview of George de Mohrenschildt. However, the film, which was kept at Hilversum, disappeared in 1975. In 1977 De Mohrenschildt agreed to disclose information to Oltmans, but disappeared from their meeting place and was found dead in Florida a few weeks later.\n\nOn 29 March 1977, De Mohrenschildt was found dead due to apparent self-inflicted shotgun blast to the mouth. L. Richardson Preyer of the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigating the assassination of Kennedy stated that De Mohrenschildt was \"crucial witness, based on the new information that he had\". A few days later, Oltmans told the HSCA that de Mohrenschildt had implicated himself in the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. And Pat S. Russell, who was De Mohrenschildt's attorney said \"I definitely feel there was a conspiracy and that definitely was the opinion of George.\" Oltmans testified for three hours behind closed doors and told the committee that De Mohrenschildt told him he had discussed the assassination of Kennedy with Lee Harvey Oswald from A to Z. \"De Mohrenschildt told me that Oswald acted at his (De Mohrenschildt's) instructions and that he knew Oswald was going to kill Kennedy,\" Oltmans said. Although Oltmans had given information to the Committee shortly before, De Mohrenschildt's death had released Oltmans from his promise not to divulge certain information. Oltmans revealed that De Mohrenschildt, whom he had known for ten years, had told him that there had been a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and that he had played a role in the conspiracy. De Mohrenschildt said that CIA and FBI personnel were involved as well.\n\nOltmans played the role of De Mohrenschildt in Oliver Stone's 1991 film about the assassination, \"JFK\".\n\nIn the 1980s Oltmans endeavoured to create a more balanced opinion in the West about the Soviet Union. Looking for a more poised perspective on the one sided bad image of the evil empire's communist power, he often traveled to Russia. Together with the Kremlin's foreign expert Georgi Arbatov, he wrote the book 'The Soviet position', elaborating on Moscow's perspective on the East-West issues in 1981. The book received much attention and was published in several languages.\n\nAlso in the '80s, Oltmans actively interfered with the postcolonial Dutch-Suriname relationship. He recognised a bilateral relationship based in negative sentiments similar to the Dutch-Indonesian relationship. Intent on playing a mediating role Oltmans traveled to Suriname to interview military dictator Bouterse. He published a book that was banned in Suriname and misunderstood in the Netherlands.\n\nDue to the ban imposed on him by Minister Luns, Oltmans was forced to help support himself through his family's inheritance; the death of his parents (1966 and 1974) and some bad investments caused him financial difficulty. In the late eighties he intended to use his large global network as a consultant to introduce entrepreneurs to Eastern European business opportunities. Through a string of quarrels with his stakeholders this initiative failed completely and Oltmans left for South Africa.\n\nBoth his brothers had settled in South Africa in 1948. He had visited the country regularly and in 1990 decided to settle there permanently. In South Africa he continued his tendency of actively intervening in local politics. His investigative reporting was not appreciated by the shaky South African regime of the time and in August 1992 he was deported on charges of espionage. Oltmans always insisted the Dutch Security Service was involved in his deportation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202834", "title": "State Implementation Plan", "text": "State Implementation Plan\n\nA State Implementation Plan (SIP) is a United States state plan for complying with the federal Clean Air Act, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The SIP, developed by a state agency and approved by EPA, consists of narrative, rules, technical documentation, and agreements that an individual state will use to control and clean up polluted areas.\n\nThe Lowest achievable emissions rate (LAER) is used by the EPA to determine if emissions from a new or modified major stationary source are acceptable under SIP guidelines. LAER standards are required when a new stationary source is located in a non-attainment air-quality region. It is the most stringent air pollution standard above the best available control technology and reasonably available control technology standards.\n\nBest available control technology (BACT) is a pollution control standard mandated by the Clean Air Act:\n\nThe EPA determines what air pollution control technology will be used to control a specific pollutant to a specified limit. When a BACT is determined, factors such as energy consumption, total source emission, regional environmental impact, and economic costs are taken into account. It is the current EPA standard for all polluting sources that fall under the New Source Review guidelines and is determined on a case-by-case basis. \n\nThe BACT standard is significantly more stringent than the reasonably available control technology standard but much less stringent than the lowest achievable emissions rate standard.\n\nReasonably available control technology (RACT) is a pollution control standard created by the EPA and is used to determine what air pollution control technology will be used to control a specific pollutant to a specified limit. RACT applies to existing sources in areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards on controlled air pollutants and is required on all sources that meet these criteria. \n\nThe RACT standard is less stringent than either the BACT or the LAER standard set forth by the EPA.\n\nIn Ohio, between 1970 and 1977, a rule in the Clean Air Act required a reduction in the measured sulfur dioxide (SO) emitted by coal-fired power plants. The State Implementation Plan to decrease the SO emitted by such plants was to increase the height of the smokestacks on the plants. The result was that the SO was carried in the wind out of the state and there was a reduction in the measured SO in the area near the source. In the 1977 amendments to the Act, Congress restricted the use of tall smokestacks as a means to attain compliance in SIPs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2202840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202840", "title": "The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)", "text": "The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)\n\nThe Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 is an 1822 painting by British artist J. M. W. Turner. It was commissioned by King George IV as a part of a series of works to decorate three state reception rooms in St James's Palace and link the Hanoverian dynasty with military success. This work was Turner's only royal commission, and was to stand as the pendant piece to Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg's \"Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June\".\nThis massive history painting measures x and was given to Greenwich Hospital shortly after its original installation. The painting now hangs in the National Maritime Museum, also in Greenwich, London.\n\nThis work depicts a scene from the Battle of Trafalgar, a naval battle fought between the British and Franco-Spanish fleet off Cape Trafalgar in southwest Spain. The British had twenty-seven ships to the thirty-three of the Franco-Spanish fleet. Despite this, the British came out as decisively victorious and captured or destroyed nineteen of the Franco-Spanish ships. Admiral Nelson, of the British Navy, took an unconventional approach to this battle and split his fleet into two lines, one led by his flagship \"Victory\" and the other by his subordinate Collingwood, to attack the Franco-Spanish fleet in columns perpendicular to their line. At the height of the battle Nelson was shot from a nearby French ship and mortally wounded. Despite this upsetting death, the victory at Trafalgar represented a crucial naval victory for the British. Their dominance effectively established them as the great naval power and ended Napoleon’s plans to conquer England. The significance of this battle for British history cannot be overstated. Afterwards, many citizens called for a government commissioned work of art depicting the battle. This reflected the role of the history painting and the artist by demonstrating the virtue of the hero, Lord Nelson, to the entire nation. The importance of Nelson and his tactics are referenced in \"Victory\"s dominating position in the scene, the execution as a history painting, and Turner's care in rendering all elements of the scene.\n\nA history painting is traditionally defined as a large-scale work depicting a scene from the Bible, mythology, or classical history. Generally regarded as the height of artistic genres, Turner recognizes this and paints \"The Battle of Trafalgar\" as a history painting depicting a contemporary event and as a patchwork scene composed of different moments portrayed as being simultaneous. Turner knows the importance of this genre and employs it to further the significance of the contemporary scene. This action firmly cements the work as being of great national significance and affirms Britain as a great maritime power. In the pursuit of these ideals and significance, Turner took several moments from the battle, across several days, and merged them into one moment in one scene. This then represents Turner's desire to take the battle and use it to create something of general, philosophical, and national significance. This aspect, along with the pyramidal composition reference triumph and sacrifice reaffirm this work's place as a history painting, despite it not depicting one scene from ancient history, religion, or mythology.\n\nThe British were attempting to establish themselves as a major maritime power; with their victory in this battle they were successful and with this painting that becomes evident. Turner had a great deal of personal interest and investment in this work and with the history of the Battle of Trafalgar in general. Turner made several sketches immediately after the battle, careful studies of the ships and their rigging, and close details of the uniforms. The most notable of these early works was \"The Battle of Trafalgar, as Seen from the Mizen Starboard Shrouds of the Victory\". This work was well received and provided the foundation from which Turner would develop \"Trafalgar\" into a scene representing an overall account of the whole battle. This earlier depiction is closer to Turner’s style in that it leans away from traditional maritime paintings and more toward the ambiguity and sublime that Turner would later be known for. In preparation for \"Trafalgar\" Turner created two preparatory oil sketches, with the \"First Sketch for ‘The Battle of Trafalgar’\" aligning its composition with the traditional maritime paintings. The \"Second Sketch for ‘The Battle of Trafalgar’\" moves away from this traditional style and more closely resembles his final product with a more organized chaos via the build-up of clouds and people in the foreground. Despite this work being a commission, Turner chooses to depict the final work in a style that moves away from conventional practices and closer to his original work and personal style further indicating his personal connection with Trafalgar. While the subject of the piece is evident, there are elements of ambiguity suggesting the sublime, the dissolution of space via strokes of pure paint, and the symmetry between human and natural forces.\n\n\n"}

It is a white crystalline material but often is encountered in an impure form that is brown and non-crystalline powder. It is generated industrially in the production of metallic iron.\n\nMgS is formed by the reaction of sulfur or hydrogen sulfide with magnesium. It crystallizes in the rock salt structure as its most stable phase, its zinc blende and wurtzite structures can be prepared by molecular beam epitaxy. The chemical properties of MgS resemble those of related ionic sulfides such as those of sodium, barium, or calcium. It reacts with oxygen to form the corresponding sulfate, magnesium sulfate. MgS reacts with water to give hydrogen sulfide and magnesium hydroxide.\n\nIn the BOS steelmaking process, sulfur is the first element to be removed. Sulfur is removed from the impure blast furnace iron by the addition of several hundred kilograms of magnesium powder by a lance. Magnesium sulfide is formed, which then floats on the molten iron and is removed.\n\nMgS is a wide band-gap direct semiconductor of interest as a blue-green emitter, a property that has been known since the early 1900s. The wide-band gap property also allows the use of MgS as photo-detector for short wavelength ultraviolet light.\n\nAside from being a component of some slags, MgS is a rare nonterrestrial mineral niningerite detected in some meteorites. MgS is also found in the circumstellar envelopes of certain evolved carbon stars, i. e., those with \"C/O\" > 1.\n\nMgS evolves hydrogen sulfide upon contact with moisture.\n"}

His weight ranged from 20-30 stone (127-190 kg) during his adulthood. Greener, from a very young age, had a tumour at the base of his pituitary gland, which controls the release of human growth hormone. The tumour caused Greener's pituitary to grow to several times the size of that of an average person, and he would not have stopped growing had the tumour not been surgically removed when he was in his late 20s. Amazingly, his condition, pituitary gigantism, was not diagnosed until 1970, when Greener was 27 years old, already at his maximum height and the record-holder as the tallest man in Britain.

He is one of the eponyms of the Rao–Blackwell theorem. He was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, the first black tenured faculty member at UC Berkeley, and the seventh African American to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics.\n\nBlackwell was also a pioneer in textbook writing. He wrote one of the first Bayesian textbooks, his 1969 \"Basic Statistics\". By the time he retired, he had published over 90 books and papers on dynamic programming, game theory, and mathematical statistics.\n\nDavid Harold Blackwell was born on April 24, 1919, in Centralia, Illinois to Mabel Johnson Blackwell, a full-time homemaker, and Grover Blackwell, an Illinois Central Railroad worker. He was the eldest of four children. Growing up in an integrated community, Blackwell attended “mixed” schools, where he distinguished himself in mathematics. During elementary school, his teachers promoted him beyond his grade level on two occasions. It was in a high school geometry course, however, that his passion for math began. An exceptional student, Blackwell graduated high school in 1935 at the age of sixteen.\n\nBlackwell entered the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with the intent to study elementary school mathematics and become a teacher. In 1938 he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in 1939, and was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in mathematics in 1941 at the age of 22, all by the University of Illinois. Blackwell was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.\n\nBlackwell did a year of postdoctoral research as a fellow at Institute for Advanced Study in 1941 after receiving a Rosenwald Fellowship. There he met John von Neumann, who asked Blackwell to discuss his Ph.D. thesis with him. Blackwell, who believed that von Neumann was just being polite and not genuinely interested in his work, did not approach him until von Neumann himself asked him again a few months later. According to Blackwell, \"He (von Neumann) listened to me talk about this rather obscure subject and in ten minutes he knew more about it than I did.\"\n\nHe departed when he was prevented from attending lectures or undertaking research at nearby Princeton University (which the IAS has historically collaborated with in research and scholarship activities) because of his race.\nSeeking a permanent position, he wrote letters of application to 105 historically black colleges and universities. He felt at the time that a black professor would be limited to teaching only at black colleges. He also sought a position at the University of California, Berkeley, and was interviewed by statistician Jerzy Neyman. While Neyman supported his appointment, race-based objections prevented his appointment at that time.\n\nHe was offered a post at Southern University at Baton Rouge, which he held in 1942–43, followed by a year as an Instructor at Clark College in Atlanta. He then moved to Howard University in 1944 and within three years was appointed full professor and head of the Mathematics Department. He remained at Howard until 1954.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1950, Blackwell spent his summers at RAND Corporation with Meyer A. Girshick and other mathematicians exploring the theory of duels. In 1954 Girshick and Blackwell published \"Theory of Games and Statistical Decisions\".\n\nBlackwell wrote one of the first Bayesian textbooks, his 1969 \"Basic Statistics\". Blackwell's \"Basic Statistics\" inspired the 1995 textbook \"Statistics: A Bayesian Perspective\" by the biostatician Donald Berry.\n\nHe took a position at the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting professor in 1954, and was hired as a full professor in the newly created Statistics Department in 1955, becoming the Statistics department chair in 1956. He spent the rest of his career at UC Berkeley, retiring in 1988.\n\nIn 2018, UC Berkeley named an undergraduate residence hall in his honor. David Blackwell Hall opened in Fall 2018.\n\n\nBlackwell married Ann Madison on December 27, 1944. They had eight children together.\n\nDavid Blackwell died of complications from a stroke on July 8, 2010 at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, California.\n\n"}

It is located on the Battle Green in Lexington, Massachusetts and operated as a museum by the Lexington Historical Society.\nThe tavern was built in about 1709–1710 by Benjamin Muzzey (1657–1735), and with license granted in 1693 was the first public house in Lexington. Muzzey ran it for years, then his son John, and then at the time of the battle it was run by John's granddaughter and her husband John Buckman, a member of the Lexington Training Band. In those years the tavern was a favorite gathering place for militiamen on days when they trained on the Lexington Green. (Lexington, unlike other local communities, did not establish a minuteman company, instead maintaining a \"training band\" [an old English phrase for a militia company] for local defense).\n\nThe Battle of Lexington and Concord took form before dawn on April 19, 1775. Having received word that the regular army had left Boston in force to seize and destroy military supplies in Concord, several dozen militiamen gathered on the town common, and then eventually went to the tavern to await the arrival of the British troops. Definite word reached them just before sunrise, and Captain Parker's company of militia left the tavern to assemble in two ranks on the common. Following the arrival of the army, a single shot was fired; by whom, it is still unknown. With this shot, the American Revolutionary War began.\n\nAlthough best known as the headquarters of the militia, Buckman Tavern is also noteworthy as perhaps the busiest of Lexington's 18th-century taverns. It housed the first village store in Lexington, and later, in 1813, the first town post office.\n\nThe tavern's interior appears today very much as it did in 1775 and one can see the restored 18th-century taproom with large fireplace and central chimney. Among the many items on display is the old front door, with its bullet hole possibly made by a British musket ball during the battle, and a portrait of John Buckman.\n\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202906", "title": "40 Below Summer", "text": "40 Below Summer\n\n40 Below Summer is an American metal band from New Jersey.\n\nForming in 1998, the band broke up seven years later in 2005. After two small reunions in 2006 and 2010, they permanently reformed in 2011. Their latest album, \"Transmission Infrared\", was released on iTunes on October 16, 2015.\n\n40 Below Summer came together after drummer and Peruvian native Carlos Aguilar met singer Max Illidge in a band named Alien. Joey D'Amico later joined the duo playing guitar. Pete Savad joined soon after playing bass at first, then moving to guitar with the addition of Jordan Plingos on bass. The self-released \"Side Show Freaks\" (1999) was recorded with these lineups at their rehearsal location in the Music Building, NYC. Savad left the band as they got close to signing their first record deal. Moving Plingos to guitar, the band added Steve Ferreira who was soon replaced by Puerto Rican-born Hector Graziani on bass. Soon after, \"Rain\" (2000) was self-released.\n\nIn late 2000, the band's self-released CD \"Side Show Freaks\" found its way to No Name Management (known for acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne). After partnering with No Name, numerous record label showcases on both coasts followed, with up to fifteen prominent labels showing interest in the band. They eventually signed with Warner Music Group's London-Sire, although at one point they were close to signing with Madonna's Maverick Records, another Warner label. In March 2001, 40 Below Summer travelled to Los Angeles to commence recording their major label debut \"Invitation to the Dance\" with famed heavy metal producer GGGarth (Rage Against the Machine, Mudvayne, Kittie). Prior to the album's release, the band embarked on a poorly attended tour with Chimaira and Ill Niño that was headlined by Factory 81. After several delays, \"Invitation to the Dance\" was eventually released on October 16, 2001 (some sources state September 11, 2001).\n\nTwo months after its release, London-Sire went out of business due to a corporate merger. This led to the band being briefly signed to parent label Warner Bros. Records during 2002. Reprise/Warner Bros. subsequently re-issued \"Invitation to the Dance\", although the band elected to leave the label in December 2002. Regarding their departure, Max Illidge stated \"The label [London-Sire] folded. which essentially meant all our funding was cut. But we couldn't go sign another deal, because Warner Brothers owned London-Sire so Warner Brothers owned our contract. They didn't even know who the fuck we were. They folded a lot of other labels too. For literally like a year they had to sift through probably a thousand different acts that were on all these labels and say 'keep them, dump them'. We were like playing phone tag talking to this guy and that guy for like a year before we finally just said please let us go.\"\n\nAfter performing on the Jägermeister Music Tour with Drowning Pool, Coal Chamber and Ill Niño, they started to write material for their second album. While the band started writing almost immediately after the release of their previous album, they threw out some fifteen songs before coming up with 21 that they reduced down to the final ten (plus a bonus track, \"The Day I Died\").\n\nUnsigned at this point, Razor & Tie Records saw the band in February 2003 when they played in New York City with E.Town Concrete. A deal was signed in June just as the band entered the studio. The band would later strike a licensing deal with Roadrunner Records for the album's UK release.\n\nTheir second album \"The Mourning After\" was released on October 28, 2003. Two singles were released from the album in \"Self-Medicate\" and \"Taxi Cab Confession\". The video for the former received a fair amount of airplay on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball. The band negotiated a release from their contract in 2004. Illidge stated \"We had trouble with Razor & Tie. They really had no experience at the time putting out rock albums. They were known for like kids pop, shit like that. They just didn't know what they were doing, they had no clue. That shit was doomed. We ended up actually getting the rights to \"Mourning After\", and we got a little money out of the deal.\" Not long after this Jordan was temporarily replaced by Ty Fury. The band then recruited Ryan Juhrs (formerly of Flaw) to fill the spot officially and Carlos left soon after.\n\nDespite breaking up, 40 Below Summer released \"The Last Dance\" on October 31, 2006 via Crash Music Inc. The album features nine demo versions of songs intended for their third LP, as well as a bonus DVD featuring footage of the band's \"last\" performance at the Starland Ballroom (September 2005). The album sold 1,095 copies during its first week of release, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nIn October 2006, there was speculation that the band had reunited. This was later dismissed by guitarist Joey D'Amico who stated that the band was just going to do a few shows to promote the release of \"The Last Dance\". However, D'Amico also stated that there was a possibility that 40 Below Summer would record a new album in the future.\n\nThe band filmed a music video for the single \"Relapse\" with director Frankie Nasso. The song was originally written by 2005 guitarist Ty Fyhrie (Fury). Ty Fyhrie also played the 2nd guitar parts on \"The Last Dance.\" Ty went on to work with the bands Murder Of Crows, Dirty Little Rabbits, FOMOFUIAB and Trapt.\n\nIn a radio interview with \"All Knowing Force\", Illidge stated that he expected 40 Below Summer would tour and play 5-10 shows a year. Although his main priority is with his new project Black Market Hero, he didn't rule out the possibility of the band one day recording another album.\n\nThe band did however re-issue their independently released EP \"Rain\" on July 31, 2007 via Crash Music. In addition to the five songs originally released, seven demo tracks were also included, as well as all new cover artwork. \"Sideshow Freaks\" was also re-released on July 15, 2008 by ex-Korn guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch's record label Driven Music Group.\n\nAli Nassar replaced Carlos, and after playing two shows under the 40 Below Summer moniker, they decided to rename the project \"Black Market Hero\". They were soon joined by 2 members of Flaw, drummer Micah Havertape and Ryan Jurhs. In January 2006, Graziani was forced to leave the band due to severe hearing loss he had suffered after years of performing. Former Confliction bassist Matt Fortin joined in August 2006. In 2008, guitar virtuoso Angel Vivaldi replaced Ryan as their permanent lead guitarist and quickly began to write fresh material for a full-length record. Black Market Hero's first single, \"Freedom Dealer,\" was released in summer 2007.\n\"With Daggers Drawn\" was the newest project consisting of former members of 40 Below Summer. Angel Vivaldi performed live in With Daggers Drawn while actively in Black Market Hero during most of 2009. This was before the addition of Joey D'Amico and Max Illidge at which point he delved further into his solo instrumental career. With Daggers Drawn consisted of Max Illidge, Joey D'Amico, Ed Schiro, Tommy Costello, and Greg Telfeian.\n\nDespite 40 Below Summer's status of being broken up at this time, Max would occasionally reunite the band to play shows at the Starland Ballroom. These shows were done as a way to draw attention to his other projects, as well as projects by friends and significant others of his (all of whom would open these \"one-off\" shows).\n\nOn July 12, 2010 it was announced that 40 Below Summer would play a reunion show on Saturday, October 2, 2010 at Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. God Forbid and With Daggers Drawn played support. 40 Below played \"Invitation to the Dance\" from cover-to-cover.\n\nOn February 27, 2012 it was announced that Max and Joey had parted ways with the project With Daggers Drawn. Soon after, the other members of the group disbanded to form rock band Pralaya, while Max and Joey returned to focusing on 40 Below Summer.\n\nOn April 3, 2012 Max Illidge posted a track list for an upcoming album entitled \"Fire at Zero Gravity\" on the band's Facebook. He also stated that \"this album will f**k you sideways\". It was announced June 12, 2012 that Joey D'Amico would play drums instead of Carlos Aguilar. Prior to the release of the album, the band released 2 songs, \"Bottom Feeder\" and \"My Name Is Vengeance\" for free download. On December 1, 2012 40 Below Summer was scheduled to perform an album release show at Starland Ballroom, although it was canceled due to damage to the venue from Hurricane Sandy. Fire at Zero Gravity was officially released on April 30, 2013 via Super Massive Music Group. In 2013, Illidge stated \"Our goal is to just make music. We have fans. Because you don't need a record label anymore, we can keep making music for a long time.\"\n\nIn February 2015, the band announced on Facebook that they were recording a new album. The production of the album was mostly funded by a crowdfunding campaign.\nOn August 31, 2016 the band premiered a music video for the song \"Snake Charmer,\" which is included on \"Transmission Infrared\" and is one of the three songs streamed prior to the album's release.\n\nIn September 2017 the band parted ways with bassist Derrick Klybish and recruited Scare Don't Fear and Beyond Visible guitarist Tom McNamara as their new bass player. McNamara played his first shows with the band in October 2017.\n\nAlthough the band are frequently labeled a nu metal band, vocalist Max Illidge (in an interview) insisted otherwise and describes 40 Below Summer as a \"aggressive rock band\" which \"explores a little bit of everything.\" 40 Below Summer's influences include Tool, Incubus, The Smashing Pumpkins, Deftones, Led Zeppelin, Monster Magnet, Alice in Chains, Yngwie Malmsteen, Candiria, Faith No More and Soundgarden.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies.\n\nThe Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new stationary source may produce. These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAA and the regulations are published in 40 CFR Part 60. NSPS have been established for a number of individual industrial or source categories. Examples:\n\n\nUnder the Clean Water Act, NSPS set the level of allowable wastewater discharges from new industrial facilities. EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of effluent guidelines for existing sources. In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the \"best available demonstrated control technology\" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the best available technology economically achievable standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a \"no discharge of pollutants standard\" (also called a \"zero discharge\" standard) if practicable.\n\nNSPS regulations are published at 40 CFR Subchapter N (Parts 405-499).

In Dragon Gate, he held every available championship in the promotion, including the Open the Triangle Gate Championship a record 12 times.\n\nNobuhiko Oshima, otherwise known as Cima, graduated from the first class of Último Dragón's Toryumon dojo. He quickly became the Toryumon wrestling promotion's biggest star. He first wrestled as Shiima Nobunaga (making a few appearances in WCW under that name), then as Shiima, until finally shortening his stage name to Cima (stylised in all capital letters), under which he still wrestles today. He was one of the founders of the Crazy Max stable, and had a years long feud with Magnum Tokyo, another first class graduate. He began as a high flyer, utilizing the \"Mad Splash\" as his finisher. This, however, took toll on his body and especially his knees. After returning from knee surgery he changed his style and started using the \"Schwein\" as his finisher. He wrestled in Toryumon Japan until 2004, when the promotion separated itself from Último Dragón's dojo, and changed its name to Dragon Gate. He created the Blood Generation stable in 2005, which had its final match in January 2007. On July 1, 2007, Cima won Dragon Gate's main title, the Open the Dream Gate Championship, from Jushin Thunder Liger in Kobe, Japan. Cima thus became the first wrestler to hold this title on two occasions.\n\nSome time in May 2008, Cima developed a neck injury. He tried to recuperate from it early as best as he could, but by the end of June, it was becoming obvious that he would need to take considerable time off to rest and heal up properly. On June 29, he vacated the Dream Gate title, just a day shy of a one-year reign as champion. On September 8, 2008, Cima appeared in a non-wrestling role at Dragon Gate's event Dragon Gate Hawaii at the Waikiki Shell, although he got involved in one match accidentally, hitting Stalker Ichikawa with a steel chair. Cima would return to the ring on December 28, 2008, when he teamed with Jushin Thunder Liger in a losing effort to capture the Dragon Gate Open the Twin Gate Championship. It was also on this day that his Typhoon unit was brought to an end, after Dragon Kid, Ryo Saito & Susumu Yokosuka lost in a Unit Split Survival Three-Way Six-Man Tag Match to teams from World-1 and Real Hazard. After that, nothing more was heard from him for over a month.\n\nThe silence was broken when, on February 9, 2009, before \"WWE Friday Night SmackDown\", he wrestled in a dark match against Jamie Noble in a losing effort. He also wrestled for WPW in California on February 15 in a tag match. On March 1, he made his return to Dragon Gate, and announced the formation of the Warriors-5 stable along with Susumu Yokosuka, Gamma, and Kagetora. The fifth member, Ryoma, was added on the 20th.\n\nTwo days later, he defeated Masato Yoshino to become the new Open the Brave Gate Champion. On April 15, he, Gamma, and Kagetora won the Open the Triangle Gate Title from Shingo Takagi, Taku Iwasa, and Dragon Kid. They would eventually lose the belts to Masato Yoshino, BxB Hulk and Pac. He also challenged Open the Dream Gate Champion Naruki Doi to a Title vs. Title Match on July 19, and despite putting up a valiant effort, he lost the Brave Gate to Doi.\n\nHe and Gamma then participated in the 2009 Summer Adventure Tag League Tournament, but they performed very poorly, only winning one match out of eight and finishing in last place. On December 29, they won the Open the Twin Gate Title from Shingo Takagi and Yamato, but they immediately handed them back, declaring themselves only tentative champions, and desired to face a strong team to determine the actual champions. On February 10, Cima and Gamma defeated Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino, officially becoming the Open the Twin Gate Champions. This win made Cima the first man to win every title in Dragon Gate. On March 22, Cima and Gamma lost the title to Takagi and Cyber Kong. On May 13, 2010, Cima, Gamma and Genki Horiguchi defeated Don Fujii, Masaaki Mochizuki and Akebono to win the Open the Triangle Gate Championship. On October 25, 2010, Cima, Gamma and Horiguchi lost the Open the Triangle Gate Championship to Naoki Tanisaki, Yasushi Kanda and Takuya Sugawara. Cima would regain the title on December 26, 2010, teaming with Dragon Kid and Ricochet.\n\nOn January 14, 2011, Cima and the Warriors turned heel, revealing themselves as the masked men who had been interfering in matches, and attacking Masato Yoshino and the World–1 group, before joining forces with Naruki Doi's group. On January 18 the new group was named Blood Warriors, a combination of the names of Cima's two previous stables, Blood Generation and Warriors. On May 15, the rest of Blood Warriors turned on Dragon Kid and kicked him out of the group, despite the fact that he still held the Open the Triangle Gate Championship with Cima and Ricochet, and replaced him with Cyber Kong and Tomahawk T.T. As a result, the title was declared vacant. On July 17, Cima and Ricochet defeated Dragon Kid and Pac of rival group Junction Three to win the Open the Twin Gate Championship. On September 11 at Way of the Ronin 2011, Cima and Ricochet defeated Masato Yoshino and Pac in a title vs. title match to win Dragon Gate USA's Open the United Gate Championship. After their third successful defense of the Open the Twin Gate Championship on November 30, Cima and Ricochet vacated the title in order for Ricochet to concentrate on defending the Open the Brave Gate Championship and Cima to concentrate on chasing the Open the Dream Gate Championship. On December 25 at \"Final Gate 2011\", Cima defeated Masaaki Mochizuki to win the Open the Dream Gate Championship for the third time. On January 19, 2012, BxB Hulk and Akira Tozawa turned on Cima, causing him to lose a ten-man \"Loser Leaves Unit\" tag team match; as a result, Cima was kicked out of Blood Warriors.\nAfter fifteen successful defenses and a reign of 574 days, Cima lost the Open the Dream Gate Championship to Shingo Takagi on July 21, 2013. During 2014, Cima won both the Open the Triangle Gate and Open the Twin Gate Championship alongside his Veteran-gun stablemates, but lost both titles in first defense. On December 3, 2014, after losing the Open the Twin Gate Championship, Cima and Gamma were forced into joining the villainous Mad Blankey stable. As part of the stable, Cima made unsuccessful attempts at recapturing the Open the Triangle Gate Championship. Cima remained a part of Mad Blankey until May 5, 2015, when members of the stable turned on him, costing him a six-way steel cage match, as a result of which he was shaved bald. On June 14, he, Don Fujii and Gamma defeated the Jimmyz (Genki Horiguchi H.A.Gee.Mee!!, Jimmy Susumu and Ryo \"Jimmy\" Saito) to win the Open the Triangle Gate Championship. On October 8, Cima formed a new unit with Eita, Gamma, El Lindaman, Punch Tominaga, and rookies Kaito Ishida and Takehiro Yamamura. On November 1, the unit was named Over Generation. The same day, he, Gamma, and Don Fujii defended the Open the Triangle Gate Championship against the Jimmyz (Jimmy Susumu, Jimmy K-Ness J.K.S., and Ryo \"Jimmy\" Saito), and vacated the title afterwards. In the summer of 2016, Cima took part in the 2016 King of Gate, finishing with 6 points and failing to advance to the final. Cima teamed up with Gamma once again for the Summer Adventure Tag League, making it to the semi finals where they lost to VerserK (Naruki Doi and Yasshi). On November 3, Cima and Dragon Kid captured the Open The Dream Gate Titles, defeating Jimmy Kagetora and Jimmy Susumu in Osaka. The two held the titles for over a year until they were forced to vacate them due to Dragon Kid suffering an injury. Cima found a new partner in Susumu, but the two were unsuccessful in defeating Eita and T-Hawk for the vacant titles at Final Gate in December 2017.\n\nIn early 2018, Cima announced his departure from Dragon Gate after 21 years working for the promotion, and also announced the formation of a new promotion, Oriental Wrestling Entertainment (OWE), to be primarily based in China. As well as Cima, T-Hawk, El Lindaman and Takehiro Yamamura also left Dragon Gate to join OWE. At OWE's inaugural event on May 7, Cima defeated T-Hawk. On June 22, representing OWE, he debuted in Wrestle-1, defeating Jun Tonsho. The rest of the OWE roster soon debuted in the promotion too, and named themselves \"Strong Hearts\", later recruiting Dezmond Xavier and Zachary Wentz to the group. Cima and Strong Hearts also debuted for DDT Pro Wrestling in September, defeating All Out (Konosuke Takeshita, Akito, Shunma Katsumata and Yuki Iino). On October 28, Cima, Duan Yingnan and T-Hawk defeated Damnation (Mad Paulie, Soma Takao and Tetsuya Endo) to win the KO-D 6 Man Tag Team Championship. The group dropped the titles to All Out on January 3.\n\nCima also made his first appearance in a North American wrestling promotion in about seven years in August 2005, appearing in Ring of Honor in a match against A.J. Styles, who Cima defeated.\n\nCima would return to North America for a three-day tour with Ring of Honor. On March 30, 2006, in Detroit, Michigan, Cima teamed with fellow Blood Generation members Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino to defeat Ring of Honor faction Generation Next, represented by Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, and Jack Evans.\n\nOn March 31, 2006, in Chicago, Illinois, Cima would once again team with fellow Blood Generation members Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino in Ring of Honor, this time losing a match to another stable from Dragon Gate, Do Fixer (Dragon Kid, Ryo Saito, and Genki Horiguchi). Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer gave the match the coveted 5 star rating.\n\nOn April 1, 2006, once again in Chicago, Illinois, at the third and final Ring of Honor show, Cima teamed with Naruki Doi in a losing attempt to win the Ring of Honor Tag Title from champions Generation Next (Austin Aries and Roderick Strong).\n\nIn September 2006 during the Labor Day Weekend, Cima participated in the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) Battle of Los Angeles super tournament. He was able to advance all the way to the finals where he lost to Davey Richards.\n\nCima's next return to Ring of Honor happened in late December 2006. Cima teamed with Shingo on December 22 in Hartford, Connecticut to challenge Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal for the ROH World Tag Team Title, but the Japanese stars came up short in the match. The next night, in Manhattan, New York, Cima and Shingo teamed with Matt Sydal to take on the team of Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, and Delirious. This time, they were successful in their outing, when Cima pinned Delirious. After the match, Cima proclaimed \"Thank you US, thank you ROH, see you in 2007\".\n\nOn January 6, 2007, Cima traveled to Australia and competed in the Australasian Wrestling Federation. In the main event, he wrestled the AWF Champion Steve Ravenous and TNT in a three-way elimination match, which Cima won to become the AWF Champion. The next night in Newcastle, TNT defeated Cima for the AWF Title.\n\nOn September 2, 2007, Cima won Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's Battle of Los Angeles tournament, defeating Human Tornado, Shingo and Pac on his way to the finals where he eliminated both El Generico and Roderick Strong.\nOn September 5, 2007, Cima made his debut in Hawaii (along with Dragon Kid, Susumu Yokosuka and Shingo Takagi) for Action Zone Wrestling, losing to AZW Heavyweight Champion Kris Kavanaugh. After the match, Cima thanked the fans and asked if Hawaii enjoyed Dragon Gate, to which the crowd started a loud Dragon Gate chant. He promised Dragon Gate would be back in Hawaii, and in AZW. He returned to AZW on January 7, 2008 at Battleclash III to defeat \"Sweet & Sour\" Larry Sweeney.\n\nOn January 29, 2012, Cima returned to PWG, teaming with Ricochet in a match, where they were defeated by the RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma). On March 30, Cima and Ricochet were forced to vacate the Open the United Gate Championship, after Cima was sidelined with a neck injury. On July 29 at Enter the Dragon 2012, Dragon Gate USA's third anniversary event, Cima and AR Fox defeated Rich Swann and Ricochet to win the vacant Open the United Gate Championship. They lost the title to The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) on April 6, 2013.\n\nCima appeared at All Elite Wrestling's Double or Nothing event on May 25, 2019 with StrongHearts stable mates T-Hawk and El Lindaman against SoCal Uncensored.\n\nOshima is married to television personality Eleni Masuda. The pair met in 2003 during a baseball game in Fukuoka, where he threw out the first pitch. He proposed to her in 2005 during a vacation in Greece and they finally wed in June 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Cima was one of many Dragon Gate wrestlers embroiled in an animal abuse scandal surrounding Cora, the pet monkey that lived in the Dragon Gate dojo. It was alleged the monkey had been choked until it passed out, burned with charcoal, thrown into a tub of boiling hot water, fed sake regularly until it would pass out, dragged around by a chain on its neck, and burned with fire crackers. Cima was reportedly the one who had brought the monkey into the dojo, but had failed to keep up with the exotic animals preservation laws, though he was not accused of any of the abuse. After the events came to light, Cima took a three-month pay cut and shaved his head to show remorse.\n\n\n"}

Acting as the liaison between a French animation producing company (Protécréa working for TF1) and the SEK Studio (Scientific Educational Korea) company, he struggles with the difficulties of outsourcing and the bureaucracy of the totalitarian closed state.\n\nThe book has 176 pages, two of them drawn by a French colleague (\"Fabrice\").\n\nIt was drawn in Ethiopia, where Delisle's wife was working for Médecins Sans Frontières.\n\nDelisle does not expect to return to North Korea, writing: \"I don't think I would be welcome there anymore.\"\n\nDelisle arrives in Pyongyang, bringing, in addition to the items that he was authorized to bring into the country, a copy of George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", that he judged appropriate for a totalitarian state, CDs of Aphex Twin, and presents like Gitanes cigarettes and Hennessy cognac.\n\nDelisle encounters former colleagues working at SEK Studio on an adaptation of the \"Corto Maltese\" comics. He also meets foreign diplomats, NGO workers in the World Food Programme and businessmen, such as French engineers installing an HDTV transmitter.\n\nDuring his two-month visit, he stays at the Yanggakdo International Hotel, and visits other foreigners in the Koryo Hotel. Accompanied by his guide, he visits the massive statue of Kim Il-sung, the Pyongyang Metro, the legation quarter, the Diplomatic Club (former Romanian embassy), the Arch of Triumph, the \"Juche\" Tower, the International Friendship Exhibition, the USS \"Pueblo\", the enormous Ryugyong Hotel, the Taekwondo Hall, the Children's Palace and the Museum of Imperialist Occupation.\n\nDelisle notes things such as tightrope walking, the absence of disabled and elderly people, North Korean music propaganda, the cult of personality for past leader Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il, the required presence of his translator and guide, nearly-expired water from the South, Coca-Cola and kimjongilias. He also notes the extreme level of apparent brainwashing in the citizens of Pyongyang, perhaps prompted by the oppressive atmosphere of the area. When questioned regarding the lack of disabled people in Pyongyang, his guide asserts and seems to genuinely believe that North Korea has no disabled, and that the children of the \"Korean race\" are all born healthy, strong and intelligent.\n\nNew Regency was working on a film version of \"Pyongyang\", with Steve Conrad to write the script and Gore Verbinski to direct the film, and to star Steve Carell, but this was cancelled in December 2014 in the wake of threats made by hackers alleged to be tied to North Korea to movie theaters over the film \"The Interview\", which mocks the North Korean regime. The film started pre-production in October 2014, and at the time of cancellation was still without a title. New Regency revealed that the scheduled distributor, Fox, cancelled their participation in the project after the incidents with \"The Interview\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202930", "title": "3 Colours Red", "text": "3 Colours Red\n\n3 Colours Red were an English rock band, formed in 1994 in London. They achieved their biggest chart success at the end of the 1990s, along with other British rock bands such as Ash and Feeder. The band was named by sticking a pin in a London listings magazine, \"Time Out\". It landed randomly on an advertisement for the concluding part of the Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski's, \"Three Colors\", trilogy. They went on to record two UK Top 20 albums, and six Top 40 singles.\n\nIn 1994, it was suggested by a mutual friend that bass player/singer Pete Vuckovic should contact guitarist Chris McCormack (ex-Forgodsake/Gunslinger) to start a band, as both had recently left their previous bands and were looking for something new. Due to location they spent the following months trading four track recordings and developing song ideas via post, until they had enough material to record a three-song demo with newly-acquired drummer Keith Baxter (formerly of Skyclad). Terry Thomas was hired as the band's manager as well as producer of the demos (the first to feature guitarist Ben Harding) that secured their recording contract.\n\nMcCormack is the younger brother of Danny McCormack, bassist in The Wildhearts, another British rock band who had already achieved commercial success, and with whom 3 Colours Red would play some of their first concerts. Ben Harding had been a founder member of Senseless Things, whilst Vuckovic's stint with Diamond Head had galvanised his songwriting.\n\nFierce Panda Records released their first single, \"This Is My Hollywood\", published by Warner Chappell Music. The band then signed to Creation Records, after Alan McGee, Creation's founder and discoverer of Oasis, said that 3CR were \"the second best band in Britain\" (after Oasis).\n\nWhile with Creation, the band recorded two albums. The first, \"Pure\" (1997) was produced by Terry Thomas. There was controversy over the resulting single \"Sixty Mile Smile\", the lyrical content of which referred to frontman Vučković's overnight hospitalisation after taking the drug ecstasy.\n\n\"Revolt\" (1999) was produced by Dave Eringa. At the peak of their success, following the band's biggest hit (the Vuckovic-penned \"Beautiful Day\") they embarked upon US tours with Marilyn Manson, Aerosmith and Silverchair. However, the group disbanded after the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 1999, citing musical and personal differences in a press release.\n\nVuckovic was signed to Sony Records and Sanctuary Management and spent two years writing an album for his new project Elevation, which was never released. McCormack joined Rich Battersby and EMF producer Ralph Jezzard for a stint in Grand Theft Audio, who spent considerable time touring America before being dropped.\n\nIn 2002, Vuckovic and McCormack reconciled their differences and reformed the band with original drummer Keith Baxter. Ben Harding had by this time forged a career in public relations and was replaced by Paul Grant (ex-Pornstar).\n\nThe new line-up signed to Mighty Atom Records and Sanctuary Management and recorded \"The Union of Souls\" album with producer Joe Gibb (Funeral for a Friend/ Million Dead) in 2004, to critical acclaim but little commercial success. \"Repeat To Fade\" and \"The World is Yours\", taken from the album, were released as singles and the band toured Europe and Japan with German bands Die Toten Hosen and The Donots as well as a handful of UK tours and festival slots including the first Download festival.\n\nIn mid 2005, a double album, \"If You Ain't Got a Weapon...\", made up of the band's singles and b-sides from the Creation period was released by Sanctuary Records, with accompanying sleeve notes penned by Vuckovic.\nA live DVD recorded at the Islington Academy in 2004 was also released, followed by a live album, \"Nuclear Holiday\" from the same show. The band split again in September 2005 after a UK farewell tour with The Yo-Yos, having been dropped by Sanctuary and disappointing sales of the third album, and continuing personal differences between Vuckovic and McCormack.\n\n\nAs a youngster, Vuckovic was a keen hard rock/heavy metal fan and played in bands with his older brother throughout his teens in his hometown of Tiverton in Devon. His first notable success came in 1993 after leaving his own band, Blackout, and moving to Birmingham to join reformed N.W.O.B.H.M./Heavy metal band Diamond Head as their bassist. He recorded on the 'Death and Progress' and 'Evil Live' albums but they split again soon after.\n\nMcCormack's first success was as a member of Newcastle upon Tyne heavy metal outfit Forgodsake, who released an album on Bleeding Heart Records before McCormack eventually left. He originally moved to London to join Honeycrack with Willie Dowling and C. J. from The Wildhearts but ended up forming 3 Colours Red with Vuckovic instead. Afterwards, he joined electro rockers Grand Theft Audio with Rich Battersby from The Wildhearts, and spent several months touring the U.S. with them before they were eventually dropped by the record label, forcing them to return home. He also tours as the guitarist in Gary Numan's live band and co-wrote several songs with Adam Ant for Ant's 2013 album \"Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter\".\n\nHarding embarked upon a career in public and media relations following the first split of 3 Colours Red in 1999.\n\nGrant went on to form Bassknives with Vuckovic, as well as joining C. J. & the Satellites with C. J. from The Wildhearts in 2006.\n\nAs a teenager, Baxter became a founder member of folk metal pioneers Skyclad, recording five seminal albums with them before leaving in 1995 to move to London and join 3 Colours Red. Following the split of the band in 1999 he formed the band Elevation with Vuckovic. The pair signed with Sony but were dropped a year later. He moved back to his hometown of Lancaster and briefly played with the Northern Irish band Therapy? in 2002.\n\nBaxter went on to play with the Lancaster-based band Baby Judas, but died on 4 January 2008 at the age of 36, from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202935", "title": "Bloxham School", "text": "Bloxham School\n\nBloxham School, also called All Saints' School, is an independent co-educational day and boarding school of the British public school tradition, located in the village of Bloxham, three miles (5 km) from the town of Banbury in Oxfordshire, England. The present school was founded in 1860 by Philip Reginald Egerton and has since become a member of the Woodard Corporation. The current headmaster is Paul Sanderson, who took over from Mark Allbrook in 2013. The school has approximately 515 pupils.\n\nFounded as a school of the Oxford Movement, Bloxham is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\nThe original school on the site in the north of the village of Bloxham was founded in 1853 by John William Hewett (1824-1886), a local Anglo-Catholic curate. The school was supported by Samuel Wilberforce who commissioned the diocesan architect, George Edmund Street, to draw up plans for the new school buildings. Street's design was described by \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" as the 'most beautiful modern Gothic buildings ever devoted in England to a scholastic purpose'. The foundation stone was blessed by Wilberforce on 7 June 1855. Hewett's plans were for a school for 100 commoners, 40 scholars and an unspecified number of choristers. In February 1855 a trust for the school was established, naming it All Saints' Grammar School, with the intent of providing for 'the liberal education of the sons of the clergy, gentry, Naval, Military and professional men and others'. Hewett contributed his own extensive library and the bulk of the funds for the ambitious building project. By mid-1856, Hewett was bankrupt and the school had failed to attract sufficient numbers of boys, who were expected to pay unusually high fees. Hewett's school, with several dozen pupils and incomplete buildings, was closed in April 1857. The school trust approached Nathaniel Woodard for help, but he was uninterested in buying or supporting the school.\n\nIn 1859, Hewett's dilapidated school buildings were bought for £1,615 by Philip Reginald Egerton, a Church of England curate working in Deddington. Like Hewett, he was strongly influenced by the Oxford Movement and sought to establish a new school to teach its values. Egerton adopted the previous foundation's name of All Saints' School, and its motto, but based the school's ethos on that of his alma mater, Winchester College. He sought the backing of several notable academics and clergymen, including Wilberforce, Woodard and Henry Liddon. The project was initially funded by Egerton's wealthy wife, Harriet, and received its first pupil on 31 January 1860. Under the personal leadership of Egerton, Bloxham initially provided education for middle class boys in the public school tradition, although classics was originally not widely taught. In 1861 there were 29 pupils and by 1863 there were 60. Thanks to Wilberforce's continued support, Street drew up new plans for expanding the neo-Gothic school buildings, and additional money was provided by John Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington and John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. The new buildings were unveiled in 1864 in the presence of Thomas Parker, 6th Earl of Macclesfield and Benjamin Disraeli. The Chapel Wing, the last of Street's buildings, was opened on 21 February 1873.\n\nThe school quickly grew, rising to two hundred pupils in twenty years. Despite Egerton's plans for the school to provide for local farmers and tradesmen, a report in 1870 found that most of the boys were from professional, ecclesiastical and military families. An 1879 plan by Egerton and Liddon to affiliate the school with Keble College, Oxford never came to fruition, and Egerton was forced to look elsewhere to ensure the school's long-term viability. The Bloxham School Trust was established in 1884, and in 1897 the school was admitted into the Woodard Corporation. Frederick Scobell Boissier, father of Harrow headmaster Arthur Boissier, taught at Bloxham from 1878 to 1898 and was headmaster from 1886. Education at the school focused on the notions of religious and civic duty, and the Anglo-Catholic nature of the foundation of the school remained a defining feature. Proposals to secularise the school by renaming it 'Bloxham College' were rejected in 1911 and 1951. Bloxham's first headmaster to not be a priest was only appointed in 1925.\n\nDuring the 1890s, Bloxham shrank in size as the local provision of state education improved. The Education Act 1902 worsened the situation, as did a growing prejudice against high church practices in schools. The school's impressive academic record and high Oxbridge entrant rates in the 1900s helped it to survive. By the 1910s, a prefect system, house rivalries, corporal punishment and fagging confirmed Bloxham's identity as a conforming public school, although the latter two practices were abolished in the 1970s. Like many public schools, Bloxham suffered disproportionately high casualties during the First World War, in which over 400 current and former pupils served and 79 were killed. The school survived the subsequent economic depression, and embarked upon a series of ambitious educational and building reforms led by the school's first lay headmaster, Armitage. During the 1960s the school pioneered a tutoring system in which boys of multiple year groups shared a tutor. This system has since been imitated by many other boarding schools. Girls started to be admitted into the sixth form in small numbers in the early 1970s and the school became fully co-educational in 1998. The Lower School, for pupils aged 11–13, was opened in 1994.\n\nBloxham School has grounds which cover approximately in the village of Bloxham. The Neo-Gothic complex of buildings designed by George Edmund Street, called Main School, dominates the school and the north end of the village. It contains two boarding houses, Crake and Wilson, the dining hall, the Masters' Dining Room, the Headmaster's office, the chapel, the 1894 Egerton Library and a number of classrooms. Palmer House, built in 1874 in the Neo-Gothic style, is the school hospital. Egerton House, on the edge of the school campus, was built in 1876 as the Headmaster's House, and was enlarged in 1886. The school's Great Hall was completed in 1937 and was built in the traditional Cotswold style. The Victorian-era Wesley Theatre, a former Methodist chapel, is the school theatre. The Science Block was built between 1959 and 1966. Wilberforce House was built in the late 1960s and Raymond House was opened in 1971 by Margaret Thatcher. Recent building developments include the Raymond Technology Centre, the expansion of the Lower School building and the Vallance Library which was opened by Colin Dexter in April 2006. New squash courts have also been built next to the Dewey Sports Centre, and the art school has been increased in size. The extension to the 1901 music school was completed in the summer of 2007, and officially opened by Aled Jones in November 2008. The Lower School is located in a modernised building called The White Lion, a former public house on the edge of the school campus.\n\nBloxham has a Church of England chapel which can accommodate approximately two hundred people. It was built at first-floor level with classrooms beneath, giving it an elevated position. At its west end is a balcony and organ loft, with an octagonal turret containing the bell tower rising above Main School. At the east end of the chapel is a large \"Te Deum\" window made by Clayton and Bell in memory of Wilberforce. The chapel also contains a rood screen, windows in memory of Egerton and the Boer Wars, and monuments to the school's war dead. The reredos was designed by Bucknall in 1912. The smaller Liddon Chapel, adjacent to the main chapel, is used as a classroom.\n\nBloxham School has four large playing fields, three of which are used for cricket in the summer term. It has two AstroTurf all-weather pitches, which are used for hockey and tennis, as well as additional hard tennis courts. The Dewey Sports Centre, opened by Anne, Princess Royal in 1986, has an indoor sports hall, a well-equipped gym and a climbing wall. Along with the swimming pool, which was extensively refurbished in 2014, it is available for public use. Bloxham also has Fives courts.\n\nDeer Park is where the bursary is situated, as well as some of the buildings used by the CCF, including the armoury and shooting range. Woollen Hale, the house of Bloxham headmasters since 1986, is located on the top of Hobb Hill, overlooking playing fields and the Main School.\n\nLike most traditional public schools, houses form the basis of school organisation and are incorporated into the boarding system. There are six boarding houses within the senior school. These are Crake, Egerton, Raymond, Seymour, Wilberforce and Wilson, with Raymond and Wilberforce being the girls' houses. There is also a junior boarding house, Park Close, for the first form (Year 7) and second form (Year 8) weekly boarders, but all junior pupils are members of Exham House. The school operates a house based tutor system, in which pupils of several year groups share a tutor within one house. All houses are made up of both boarders and day pupils, who are called 'dayboarders'. House captains are appointed each year and make up part of the school's prefect body. The two oldest houses are Crake and Wilson, previously called School House, with all the other houses constituted later. The newest boarding house to be built was Seymour, which was finished in 1982. Houses provide a focal point for social and sporting activity, with keen rivalries existing between different houses.\n\nThe founder of Bloxham, P. R. Egerton, envisaged Bloxham as a school which would take in the sons of local families and turn out young men ‘well educated in the Christian faith.’ Religion still plays a major role in the life of the school and this is focussed on the Chapel of All Saints. Two Eucharistic services are held each week for the pupils in the chapel, and Morning Prayer is held every day. For larger school occasions such as Founderstide (the founder's day) and Christmas, the school uses St Mary's Church, Bloxham. The chaplain plays an important part in school life and is helped by a team of chapel prefects. Special arrangements are made for non-Anglicans to attend their own places of worship if required.\n\nThe school has hosted the Bloxham Festival of Faith and Literature since October 2011.\n\nThe Bloxham Project is an inter-school council started in the 1960s to address the role of religion in schools. It was started by the Chairman of Bloxham School Council and the school chaplain, Donald Dowie. The first Bloxham Conference on Public School Religion took place in 1967 at Bloxham School, and today approximately 120 independent schools take part in the project. It is a full-time organisation which continues to promote Christian educational values in the United Kingdom. The project is currently run from Ripon College Cuddesdon near Oxford, where several of Bloxham's headmasters have been educated.\n\nSport plays a significant role in Bloxham life, with afternoons on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays being allocated to games' practices and matches for pupils in years 9–13. Every pupil in the school is involved in sport, with the aim being that each pupil will represent the school in at least one team during their time at Bloxham. The major sports are rugby, hockey and cricket for boys, and hockey, netball and tennis for girls. Other sports played at Bloxham include squash, athletics, swimming, golf, riding, polo, target shooting, clay pigeon shooting, fives, sailing, cross-country and badminton.\n\nThe school's main sporting rivals include Stowe School, St Edward's School, Oxford, Warwick School, Rugby School and Magdalen College School, Oxford. Bloxham participates annually in the NatWest Schools Cup for rugby union. Bloxham has recently won national titles in shooting, polo and riding, and regional titles in rugby, hockey and sailing.\n\nBloxham has several societies, some of which are pupil-run. Notable school societies include the Scholars Society, the Debating Society and the Common Room Society. The Choral Society, or Chapel Choir, sing twice a week during the school's chapel services. Clubs include a Photography Club, a Wildlife Club and a Model Railway Club. Bloxham School was host of the British Youth Go Tournament in 2011. Pupils are given the opportunity to take part in many other activities, such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award, drama, community service, dance, adventure training, horse riding and management and horticulture. Many of these run on a Monday, Tuesday and Thursday afternoon in time set aside for school activities.\n\nBloxham runs a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) for pupils in third form (Year 9) and above. This was founded in 1910 as the school's Officers' Training Corps, and under Armitage it became one of the most respected contingents in the country. Bloxham is one of the few schools in the country to have been granted its own cap badge and many former members have served with distinction in the British armed forces. Most terms there is a CCF over-night expedition and a range day. The CCF was formerly affiliated with the Royal Green Jackets and is now affiliated with its successor regiment, The Rifles.\n\nThe school has a large music department which offers professional tuition in brass, guitar, keyboard, organ, percussion, singing, strings and woodwind.\n\nThe school magazine is called \"The Bloxhamist\" and is now published at the beginning of every Michaelmas term.\n\nThe school’s prefect system was introduced in its current form by Armitage in the late 1920s. Prefects were solemnly initiated in chapel, and once in office they were responsible for much of the daily administration of the school. Prefects were in charge of most discipline and a prefectural code was introduced; school prefects could give up to six strokes with a cane, and house prefects three.\n\nToday the school has various grades of prefect, all drawn from the Upper Sixth, each with different responsibilities and privileges:\n\nThe motto of Bloxham School is taken from Hewitt's 1853 school. A quotation from the Book of Proverbs, it is \"Justorum Semita Lux Splendens\" (Latin), which translates as \"The path of the just is a shining light\". Until 2009, the school arms was that of the Egerton family, although this usage was never registered with the College of Arms. It is now a stylised version of the original coat-of-arms.\n\nBloxham operates a three-term year:\n\nThe yearly fees for a senior full boarding pupil are £30,585 per year, and £23,670 per year for day pupils. This makes Bloxham the third most expensive school in Oxfordshire.\n\nCurrent members of the school are known as 'Bloxhamists' with alumni referred to as 'Old Bloxhamists', or OBs for short. Notable OBs include:\n\nMilitary\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nReligion\n\nThe arts\n\nOther\n\nThe stone arch at the main entrance to the school was built to the memory of Bloxham pupils who have died in conflict, and the school chapel contains memorials to the school's war dead from multiple conflicts. As with many public schools, Bloxham suffered a disproportionately high casualty rate during World War I, in which 79 current and former pupils were killed. The portraits of the school's dead of the First World War are hung near the chapel.\n\nThe first five headmasters at Bloxham were ordained Anglican priests, with the first lay headmaster being appointed in 1925. The portraits of former headmasters hang in the school dining hall.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2202938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202938", "title": "Lego minifigure", "text": "Lego minifigure\n\nA Lego minifigure, commonly referred to as a minifig, is a small plastic articulated figurine produced by Danish toy manufacturer The Lego Group. They were first produced in 1978 and have been a success, with over 3.7 billion produced worldwide as of 2003. Minifigures are usually found within Lego sets, although they are also sold separately as collectables in blind bags, or custom-built in Lego stores. While some are named as specific characters, either licensed from film, television, and game franchises, or of Lego's own creation, many are unnamed and are designed simply to fit within a certain theme (such as police officers, astronauts and pirates). Minifigures are collected by both children and adults. They are highly customizable, and parts from different figures can be mixed and matched, resulting in many combinations.\n\nSimilar figures are produced by other companies, such as the \"Kreons\" from the construction toy Kre-O by the Korean company Oxford (subsidiary of Hasbro), or the figures by Block Tech or the Canadian company Mega Bloks.\n\nA precursor to the minifigure was released in 1975. These were at the same scale as the current minifigures, but had a different design. They had solid torsos without separate movable arms, solid lower body pieces that were not moveable, and heads without printed features. They had a small variety of headpieces in various colors, including caps, pigtail hair and cowboy hats.\n\nThe first modern minifigures were released in 1978, included in Castle, Space, and Town sets. These were designed by Jens Nygaard Knudsen, who had come up with the idea for having the torsos, legs, and arm pieces interchangeable. As these were made into pieces, the company decided to give them a simple facial expression, rendered as two solid black dots for eyes and a smile painted in solid black, and without any gender or racial components, believing that these factors would be \"determined by the child’s imagination and play\".\n\nIn 1989 for the launch of Lego Pirates theme, minifigures also included hooks for hands, as well as peg legs; this was the first departure from the traditional body parts. Starting with Lego Pirates in 1989 and spreading to Lego Town and Lego Castle in the next few years, minifigures were also produced with different facial expressions such as facial hair, eye patches, feminine makeup, and sunglasses. Most of these early facial additions were still centered around the two eyes and smile, however starting in 1997 with Willa the Witch of the Fright Knights facial expressions became more complex including open mouths and detailed eyes. \n\nAnother departure from traditional parts was the use of spring-loaded legs. These legs are joined together at the top. These legs were only featured in basketball sets, 2002–2003. Other leg variations include short legs for children or dwarfs, or long legs (used in the \"Toy Story\" theme).\n\nIn 2003, the first minifigures with naturalistic skin tones (as opposed to the yellow used until this point) were released, as part of the Lego Basketball theme; these minifigures were also created in the likeness of living people. This also included Lando Calrissian in the Star Wars theme. The following year, the use of natural skin tones was expanded to all licensed products; in which figures were created to represent film actors and other living people. Popular examples include Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and Batman minifigures.\n\nBy 2006, Lego had reportedly produced 4 billion minifigures. There are at least 3655 different minifigures produced between 1975 and 2010 and the number of new minifigures per year is increasing rapidly. In 2010 more than 300 new minifigures were introduced.\n\nMinifigures generally feature six parts (widely referred to as \"tools\" in the toy industry): head, torso, hips, arms, hands, and legs; these six parts allow seven points of articulation: swivel head, swivel arms, swivel wrists, and swivel legs. Minifigures are usually packaged as three separate parts in Lego sets: head, torso and legs. The plastic is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a tough material that makes LEGO figures durable.\n\nThe plastic is melted into specially designed molds that produce the different parts of the minifigure. Some of the molds are also accessories such as weapons (swords, guns, lightsabers, etc.) or everyday accessories (cups, food, tools, etc.). Heads and torsos nearly always need further decoration, and sometimes the arms and legs do, too. This difficult process is why the figures are more expensive than any other Lego products. After being printed, the head is placed on the torso, the legs attached, and the arms are snapped on. The figures are finally bagged and readied for sale.\n\nMinifigure heads are cylindrical, and attach to a long, narrow cylinder molded onto the top of the torso, which allows the head to rotate. This feature also allows items to be attached to the figures over the torso, such as air tanks, capes or breastplates. The heads have a stud on top which is the same size as studs on standard Lego bricks which could allow one to be placed on it. The head is the only component of the minifigure which can be used for other applications - blank minifigure heads have often been used in Lego sets to replicate other objects such as lampshades and electrical appliances.\n\nHead accessories vary widely, and include hair, helmets and hats. The legs rotate independently to 90 degrees forward, and nearly 45 degrees backward. Minifigures also connect to standard Lego bricks in both a sitting or standing position. The hands of a minifigure resemble the letter \"C\", which allows them to hold many Lego accessories as well as bricks, tiles, and plates. There are hundreds of different accessories, including swords, axes, wands, cups, guns, and lightsabers. Additionally, the tops of the hands are approximately the same size as the studs on standard Lego bricks, which allows Lego pieces to be placed on top of them. These variations allow minifigures to be customized, keeping with the modular design of Lego elements.\n\nWhile nearly all minifigure heads, torsos, arms, hands and legs are the same size and shape, some sets have included figures that deviate from the standard.\nOne of the most extreme design variations was a minifigure produced in an edition of five of the Star Wars character C-3PO, cast in solid 14-karat gold.\n\nMinifigures built from special, uniquely molded pieces were first introduced in Life on Mars. Martians are composed of five tools: two pairs of double arms, a mechanical torso, a conjoined leg piece, and a head. This configuration is also used for many \"Star Wars\" Droids; Battle Droids follow the same pattern, while Super Battle Droids feature a head fixed to a torso, General Grievous has space for four arms, and IG-88 has a head constructed of other Lego pieces. Other droids, such as Droidekas, Spider Droids and Pit Droids, are constructed entirely from standard Lego pieces, yet are still generally considered minifigures. R2-D2 and other astromech droids are constructed from unique parts, with a separate top, body and legs. The robots of Exo-Force, Mars Mission commander aliens and Bionicle miniatures have a design similar to the Star Wars Battle Droids, but with separate legs, movable hands, and a head affixed to a small torso. Hagrid, the half-giant character from the Harry Potter series, uses a larger minifigure body, with only the head being separable.\n\nSkeletons, usually found in Castle, Pirate, and Indiana Jones sets, use the standard minifigure head, but unique torsos, arms, and legs designed to resemble a skeletal structure; although different, these figure parts are still detachable. Skeleton figures and others alike stir up controversy on whether they should be considered a minifigure or just a \"figure\", due to the lack of standard minifigure parts.\n\nAdditionally, some minifigures, mostly pirates, sometimes include peg legs and hooks for hands.\n\nMinifigures have also featured unique head sculpts that differ from the traditional cylindrical shape; the first was Jar Jar Binks, included in a Star Wars set in 1999, followed by Yoda, C-3PO, Harry Potter goblin figures, Kit Fisto, and Plo Koon. Kit Fisto was the first minifigure to not use an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene head. The minifigure used rubber instead. Traditional accessories, such as hats and helmets, cannot be placed on these non-standard heads. Some minifigures, such as Wookiees, Gamorrean Guards and Ewoks use a sandwich board piece which fits over the body. SpongeBob has a sculpted Lego brick head that fits like a standard head, similar to the ghost figures, except that these figures use short or standard legs instead of a brick.\n\nAn enormous variety of clothing and accessories has been produced for minifigures, including hairstyles, caps, hats, and helmets. In Lego Star Wars sets, Clone Troopers and Stormtroopers have uniquely sculpted helmets, adapting the original character designs to the minifigure format. Exo-Force minifigures feature anime-style hair, as does the Nightwing minifigure from the Batman Arkham Asylum set.\n\nGhost figures have a full-body cape which attaches to the head of the minifigure, and solid brick-like legs\n\nSome minifigures created to resemble female characters, particularly in Castle and Pirate sets, use large sloped bricks instead of legs, to resemble dresses or skirts. However, these sloped bricks are taller than standard minifigure legs, making some characters seem awkward when placed next to taller females. In 2018, a special skirt piece was released, shorter, more softly curved on the back, and with regular leg pins to connect to the torso, instead of the studs on ordinary bricks.\n\nIn the Simpsons theme as well as other themes, a skirt fabric has been created allowing the minifigure to wear skirts. However, the first skirt mold appeared for the Minnie Mouse and Alice minifigures within the Disney Collectible minifigures theme. The mold for the Ballerina's skirt does predate the Disney minifigures by several months, but it resembles a straight up oval plate and considered a tutu.\n\nShorter legs, without joints at the hip, are sometimes used to create minifigures which are shorter in stature than standard figures (i.e. children, a leprechaun, Yoda or The Penguin). Such pieces were first created for Star Wars sets but have since been used elsewhere. In 2018, a medium-sized pair of legs was introduced, sized between the shorter legs and regular legs. These legs had a joint at the hip to allow individual movement of the legs, and were used to represent older tweens or younger teenagers, introduced for the rebooted Harry Potter theme.\n\nOther legs include Genie smoke legs, mermaid tail legs, snake tail legs and octopus legs.\n\nMinifig customisation is the practice of modifying Lego minifigures. This can be as simple as mixing and matching parts, or as complex as painting or remolding plastic. Some custom minifigures are made by affixing stickers or decals to the figures. There are also third party businesses which sell custom decals and molded minifigure accessories, many of which are inspired by popular media such as films and video games. While a relatively recent phenomenon, minifigure customisation has rapidly become popular within the wider building community, although some maintain a \"purist\" approach, using only elements produced by Lego.\n\nLego executives have for some years now been using personalised minifigures in place of business cards, with email and phone details on the front and back of the torso, and hair and facial features designed to resemble each executive. You can see a list of 39 of these here at 39 Lego Employee Business Cards. It is believed that over 100 of these exist.\n\nBoth children and adult fans of lego (AFOL) collect Lego Minifigures without collecting the sets. The Lego group has produced more than 1,000,000,000 Minifigures in the past 30 years and many people buy and sell these on eBay and other sites such as Bricklink. Most of the minifigures ever produced can be seen at Bricklink Minifigure Catalog. Some of the most expensive and rare minifigures can be viewed at Rare and Expensive Lego Minifigures.\n\nThe Collectible Minifigures (CMF) theme, introduced in 2010, is a set of individually packaged \"blind bag\" minifigures. Each series consists of approximately 16 new and exclusive minifigures, with a random assortment of 60 polybags per box. A new series is released every three to four months, with some having a theme (e.g. monsters or masquerade) and others including a wide variety of minifigs. Several blogs publish \"feel guides\" to help collectors figure out which minifigures are inside the opaque package. The minifigures can be based on movies, sports, fiction, history, or jobs/hobbies (i.e. Punk Rocker, Dino Tracker, Caveman). All CMF minifigures come with a Lego \"stand\". Most CMF come with an (often unique) accessory and many have uniquely printed body parts.\n\nOther variations of the standard minifigure produced for Star Wars sets included the light-up light-saber (L.U.L.S.) minifigures. These figures were released as a part of the more expensive Star Wars Episode III sets in 2005. These figures look like standard minifigures, but to facilitate internal electronics, their parts cannot be removed; the only exception to this is the headgear, the left hand and arm, and each of the legs from the hips. When the head is pressed down, an LED illuminates the light-saber blade. These figures rely on battery power for their special feature. The batteries last three hours and are not intended to be replaced, although replacement is possible. \n\nMany fans, especially children, were amenable to this innovation. Others however, particularly adult collectors, found these figures contentious, considering them to be an unwelcome gimmick. The fact that in two cases unique characters were produced solely as L.U.L. minifigs, with no standard version available to collectors, was also an unpopular decision. Following the initial release of these figures Lego announced no more were to be produced, due to their unpopularity and more expensive production. One set, the 7261 Clone Turbo Tank, which featured an L.U.L. version of Jedi Knight Mace Windu, was even reissued with a standard version of the minifig and an extra Clone Trooper figure to make up the cost of the set. \n\nThere was also at least one high end City themed set (a Police Station/HQ) that included a police officer with a light up 'torch'. Another L.U.L.S. minfig in police uniform appeared without the 'saber' part of the light saber and a yellow LED in the 'handle' of the light saber, reusing the L.U.L.S. design outside the Star-wars setting as an effective 'torch'. He appeared in a high end City set based on a standard and well selling City Police HQ design. A complaint about the set was that the L.U.L.S. minifig was contained in a 'try me' compartment of the box allowing customers (and excited children) to wear down his battery while he was still on the shelf. The set was discontinued after a year with a separate identical design but with 3 extra normal minifgs replacing the L.U.L.S. minfig.\n\nYet another variation on the minifigure is the magnet figure, from such themes as Star Wars, Batman, Indiana Jones, and City. The magnet figures are not included in regular sets but are instead sold in packs of three or more. Some of these include accessories and display base bricks. These figures include magnets in their legs, which allow them to stick to metal surfaces. Magnet figures are nearly indistinguishable from standard figures in appearance. Unlike the LUL figures, only the torso and the hips of magnet minifigures are inseparable.\n\nWithin the Lego Games theme, the Lego microfigures were released. For that name, they are about half the size of the regular Lego minifigure. The microfigures have a fixed head, small, non-movable legs which somewhat resemble normal minifigure legs, and a hint of shoulders for arms. The microfigures have found their way into commercially available sets such as 10253 Big Ben.\n\nLego Nanofigures are miniature versions of original minifigures, following the same general shape, but without any moving parts, roughly the same height as a regular minifigure's legs. They were originally, from 2010, produced in metal colors to represent statuettes, but later, from 2011 onwards, got printing to represent characters in sets produced in micro-scale, too small for regular minifigures, or to represent diminutive characters such as Ant-Man.\n\nIn 2016, a new minifigure mold was released which is a new baby. The baby is not like a microfigure, but rather a scaled-down minifigure of the adult one produced with arms and legs but not moveable. It currently appears in the Lego City Fun at the Park set, with the 16th series of Lego Minifigures, and LEGO 10255 Assembly Square, which is the 2017 Lego Modular Buildings.\n\nIn some Lego products, figures other than standard minifigures are used. A catalog that shows all these Lego figures is available. Some Lego sets from 1974 on included much larger figures where only the heads and hair were special pieces , which is why the usual figures are \"mini\". Technic used larger scale action figures between 1986 and 2001. These figures featured more realistic sculpts, although still distinctively angular, and featured more articulation, including bendable elbows and knees. These figures are further distinguished from minifigures in that they cannot be easily disassembled; even the hair pieces are non-removable. Duplo includes figures that have less articulation than standard minifigures and cannot be disassembled for safety reasons. Likewise, the Fabuland collection, produced in the 1980s, consisted of larger anthropomorphized animal characters, which also could not be easily disassembled. Belville and Scala, Lego products marketed to girls, also include larger scale figures. These figures are similar to Technic figures in articulation, but featureless angular body sculpts. Scala figures more closely resemble dolls, in that clothes are separate from the figures and hair is made of strands rather than molded plastic. The Lego Baby line included figures that could move at all and had the size a bit bigger than the Duplo figures. In 2001 Lego further expanded the minifigure system, with the introduction of Bionicle figures. These figures are a part of a fictional story developed by Lego and resemble biomechanical creatures. Initially, these figures were produced without articulation, only able to hold tools and weapons. Bionicle later got replaced with Hero Factory in 2010. In 2005, Lego released Bionicle playsets, with minifigure variations of characters that had previously been produced in the larger Bionicle scale, notably the Toa and Visorak characters. While these minifigures did not feature movable parts, Lego released Piraka and Inika playsets in 2006, which included minifigures with movable parts. The Friends theme, released in 2012, included mini-doll figures, a more doll-like construction with more realistic anatomy, soon introduced into other themes chiefly aimed at girls. Even though the mini-dolls in the Lego Friends theme have more realistic anatomy, the mini-dolls' legs can only move ninety degrees into a sitting position. The mini-dolls' legs are also molded together and can not move separately as the traditional Lego minifigure legs can. The mini-doll in the Lego Friends theme is slightly taller than the traditional minifigure.\n\n\n"}

She is a Saracen sorceress.\n\nIn Tasso's epic \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (), Rinaldo is a fierce and determined warrior who is also honorable and handsome. Armida has been sent to stop the Christians from completing their mission and is about to murder the sleeping soldier, but instead she falls in love. She creates an enchanted garden where she holds him a lovesick prisoner. Eventually Charles and Ubaldo, two of his fellow Crusaders, find him and hold a shield to his face, so he can see his image and remember who he is. Rinaldo barely can resist Armida's pleadings, but his comrades insist that he return to his Christian duties. At the close of the poem, when the pagans have lost the final battle, Rinaldo, remembering his promise to be her champion still, prevents her from giving way to her suicidal impulses and offers to restore her to her lost throne. She gives in at this, and like the other Saracen warrior woman, Clorinda, earlier in the piece, becomes a Christian and his \"handmaid\".\n\nMany painters and composers were inspired by Tasso's tale. The works that resulted often added or subtracted an element; Tasso himself continued to edit the story for years. In some versions, Armida is converted to Christianity, in others, she rages and destroys her own enchanted garden. She occupies a place in the literature of abandoned women such as the tragic Dido, who committed suicide, and the evil Circe, whom Odysseus abandoned to complete his voyage, but she is considered by many to be more human, and thus more compelling and sympathetic, than either of them.\n\nThe story of Armida and Rinaldo has been the basis for a number of operas:\n\nOn 1 May 2010, Rossini's \"Armida\" was performed and broadcast live to theaters around the world in the series \"MetLive in HD\".\n\nJohannes Brahms composed a cantata entitled \"Rinaldo\" based on the story.\n\n"}

Anderson is credited with helping bring the art of magic from street performances into theatres and presenting magic performances to entertain and delight the audience.\n\nAnderson was born in The Mearns, Scotland. Orphaned at the age of ten, he started his career appearing on the stage with a travelling dramatic company in 1830. At seventeen, he began performing magic and in 1837, at the age of twenty-three, he performed at the castle of Lord Panmure, whose endorsement of Anderson inspired him to put a touring show together which lasted for three years. In 1840, Anderson settled in London, opening the New Strand Theatre. Sir Walter Scott is said to have given him the stage name, The Great Wizard of the North.\n\nAnderson's success came from his extensive use of advertising and popular shows which captivated his audience. The Wizard was committed to philanthropy and expert showmanship, making him one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. Anderson declared: \"It is the duty of all magicians to give entertainment,\" and he was not content to perform an illusion to simply demonstrate that he could accomplish something that the audience could not explain. If the effect was not enthusiastically received, Anderson would remove it from his act. Anderson is famous for a lifetime of successful performances of the bullet catch illusion. Although he did not invent the trick, he made it widely popular and several of his rivals copied Anderson's version in their own shows. Anderson is also credited to be the first magician to pull a rabbit out of a tophat. The trick had existed before in different forms, yet, Anderson was the first magician that performed this classic trick on stage.\n\nIn 1842, Anderson married Hannah Longherst from Aberdeen, an assistant with his show. The following year their son John Henry Jr. was born. In 1845, Anderson's mistress Miss Prentice gave birth to Philip Prentice Anderson, but died in childbirth. Anderson, however, supported the child for his entire life. Anderson would also have two daughters – Helen and Alice – who assisted in their father's show and later became successful magicians, and a second illegitimate son with a member of his touring troupe.\n\n1845 also saw the completion of Anderson's second theatre, the City Theatre in Glasgow. In November, only four months after opening, the theatre burned and Anderson's financial losses were considerable. Through the aid of his show business friends, Anderson was able to launch a new show at London's Covent Garden Theatre in 1846 and then toured Europe the following year, travelling to Hamburg, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg, where he met Czar Nicholas I, who arranged a command performance for Anderson after an awkward chance meeting.\n\nIn 1849, Anderson returned to London to perform for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The following year, Anderson toured America, Canada, Australia, and Hawaii. Upon returning to Britain, Anderson found that he had a rival in fellow magician Robert Houdin.\n\nRobert-Houdin's inventions were pirated by his trusted mechanic Le Grand who was arrested for making and selling duplicate illusions. Many of those illusions fell into the hands of his competitors like The Great Wizard of the North, Robin, and Compars Herrmann. It is not known whether Anderson or the others bought the illusions directly from LeGrand or from another source. But, they willingly performed the illusions after knowing that those were invented by Robert-Houdin.\n\nHerrmann too was performing in London with Robert-Houdin's pirated tricks. Anderson took Houdin's tricks and returned to America in 1853 and performed in Boston. An illusion involving Anderson's dispensing of various alcoholic beverages to the audience caused a legal controversy regarding temperance in that city.\n\nIn 1859, after a brief period as an actor, Anderson began another world tour. In 1862, at the age of eighteen, John Henry Jr. left his father's troupe and began his own independent career as a conjuror. This started a bitter feud between father and son and the two never spoke again. Greatly in debt, Anderson returned to England in 1864. He would tour once more in 1866.\n\nAnderson died in 1874 at the Fleece hotel in Darlington, County Durham. He was buried next to his mother in Aberdeen. Magician Harry Houdini, who was born in the same year as Anderson's death, revered Anderson as one of his inspirations and in 1909 arranged for the upkeep of the gravesite, which had fallen into disrepair.\n\nIn 1854, Anderson held a farewell performance in Aberdeen. The success of this show was enough to inspire Anderson not to retire. Rather, he began to concentrate his efforts on exposing the tricks of mediums and spiritualist fraud. In his shows, he used his daughters to duplicate spiritualist effects. Anderson was one of the magicians of his day who exposed the frauds of the Davenport brothers. The show played at the Lyceum in London and then moved to Covent Garden in 1855. The following year, after a gala performance, the theatre caught fire, destroying all of Anderson's properties and bankrupting him for the second time in his professional career.\n\nAnderson stated that spiritualism was a \"delusion that has driven ten thousand persons mad in the United States.\"\n\nSometime between 1879 and 1881, self styled \"Professor of Magic\" Philip Prentis Hind (1844–1920) began using Anderson as his last name and the stage name of Professor Anderson for his magician's act in Australia presenting himself as the successor to the original Wizard of the North. His act included his wife Louisa as a clairvoyant.\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne. Its success made Snipes a popular action hero icon. It also introduced Snipes' famous line: \"Always bet on black.\"\n\nInternational psychopath terrorist and crime boss Charles Rane (Payne), whom the media dubs as \"The Rane of Terror\", is arrested by the FBI and local authorities just as he is about to receive plastic surgery to alter his features to evade the law. The FBI make plans to return Rane to Los Angeles aboard a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar passenger aircraft, for him to stand trial.\n\nWidower John Cutter (Snipes) is a retired United States Secret Service agent and police officer who is trying to recover from the haunting memories of his wife's death in a convenience store robbery, and has taken to training flight attendants in self defense, including Marti Slayton (Alex Datcher). After one class, Cutter is approached by an old friend, Sly Delvecchio (Tom Sizemore), who offers Cutter the vice presidency of a new antiterrorism unit for his company, Atlantic International Airlines. Cutter is reluctant, but Delvecchio and the company's president, Stuart Ramsey (Bruce Greenwood), convince him to accept the offer.\n\nCutter boards as the 57th passenger on an Atlantic International flight to Los Angeles, where Marti is one of the flight attendants. Rane and his two FBI escorts are also aboard. After the flight takes off, several henchpersons in Rane's employ, posing as flight attendants and passengers, kill the FBI agents, release Rane, and secure the plane by also killing the captain. Cutter, in the lavatory at the time, manages to use the plane's on-board phone to warn Delvecchio of the situation, but Cutter is soon discovered by one of Rane's henchmen.\n\nCutter overpowers the henchman and takes his weapon; he then uses the agent as a shield to confront Rane. Rane is indifferent and shows his ruthlessness by taking a passenger hostage and then killing him without mercy. Rane also shoots his own henchman in a further show of force. Cutter realizes he is outmatched and escapes with Marti to the plane's cargo hold, dispatching another of Rane's men, Vincent, who is disguised as a caterer.\n\nCutter dumps the plane's fuel, forcing Rane to order the surviving pilots to land at a small Louisiana airfield. Cutter jumps from the plane as it lands, but Marti is caught by Vincent and kept aboard. The local sheriff, Chief Leonard Biggs (Ernie Lively), arrests Cutter, thinking he is a terrorist, and takes him to the airport building.\n\nRane contacts the field's tower and demands refueling, for which he promises half the passengers will be freed. For every five minutes of resistance or indecision, Rane will order five passengers to be executed. Rane also asserts that Cutter is one of his own men turned against him. Biggs gives the go-ahead for refueling, and as the passengers are freed, Rane and his men escape from the plane, having given orders to those still on board to kill the rest of the hostages if their plans are interfered with. Cutter recognizes the passenger release as a diversion, escapes from the sheriff, and chases Rane and his men into a local county fair. FBI agents arrive and confirm Cutter's true identity to Biggs. Cutter is able to kill one of Rane's men and gets into a fight with Rane before police arrive and capture him.\n\nBack at the tower, Rane announces that if he does not contact the plane and give flight clearance, his men aboard have been instructed to kill the rest of the hostages. The FBI agents arrange to return Rane to the plane, escorted by two agents, with plans to have a sniper take down Rane and allow them to storm the plane to save the hostages. However, the sniper is Vincent, who kills the escorts, but is shot dead by Cutter, and Rane makes it inside safely. Rane orders the pilots to take off, while Cutter, with Biggs' help, manages to jump from a car onto the speeding plane before it takes off.\n\nInside, Cutter deals with more of Rane's accomplices before getting into a fight with Rane. Their fight blows out one of the plane's windows, causing the bulkhead door to blow out due to the explosive cabin decompression. Cutter manages to get Rane close to the open door and kicks him out of the plane, which sends Rane, screaming in terror, out into the night sky, where he falls to his death. The plane quickly returns to the airfield, where the FBI agents secure Rane's remaining agents and the remaining hostages are freed. Amid congratulations and celebration, Marti and Cutter make their quiet escape into the distance hand-in-hand, but not before Chief Biggs offers them a ride.\n\n\nThe film was based on a script by Stewart Raffill. It was written as a vehicle for Clint Eastwood about a man going to bury his son in Spain who sat next to an Iranian terrorist on the plane. The terrorist hijacks the plane and takes the passengers to Iran. Then the Clint Eastwood character escapes, captures the Mullahs and holds them as prisoners in exchange for American prisoners.\n\nRaffill says \"The head of the studio said to me, “If I make that movie, they’ll blow up the theaters.” So I did a couple of re-writes for them, for Warner Bros who owned it, then I got another picture and came back and then it became a black movie.\"\n\nRaffill says his work only remains in the first quarter of the resulting film.\n\nAlthough supposedly set partly at a small airport in Louisiana, filming took place in Snipes' hometown of Orlando, Florida, with Orlando-Sanford International Airport standing in for \"Lake Lucille\" airport in Louisiana. The airport's former combination main hangar and control tower from its time as Naval Air Station Sanford was used for many key scenes just prior to its demolition after filming.\n\n\"Passenger 57\" was released on November 6, 1992, and opened at number one rank in 1,734 theaters. The opening weekend receipts were $10,513,925. The film's final US domestic gross receipts were $44,065,653. \"Passenger 57\" is one of the films that launched Wesley Snipes' career in the action genre. Because of this film's success, Wesley Snipes was cast in lead roles of other features, including \"Money Train\", \"Drop Zone\", \"Demolition Man\", \"The Art of War\", and the \"Blade\" trilogy.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. Critics praised Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne's performances, but panned the script. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 24% rating based on 25 reviews, with an average score of 4.14/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMarcus Trower, of \"Empire\" magazine, stated that Bruce Payne was \"a brilliantly disconcerting madman. With his flowing blond Jesus locks, armor-piercing stare and casual sadism, he makes Hannibal Lecter look like a social worker – and like Sir Anthony Hopkins' serial killer, part of the man's menace is in the apparent contradiction between his articulate, well-spoken English and his off-hand brutality.\" The \"Radio Times\" stated that Payne and Snipes both gave 'charismatic turns' in the film. \"The New York Times\" stated that Payne brought a 'tongue-in-cheek humor to the psychopathic fiend' that he played. A reviewer for \"People\" magazine stated that \"Bruce Payne steals the plane—and the movie\".\n\nDVD was released in Region 1 in the United States on May 27, 1998, and Region 2 in the United Kingdom on April 26, 1999, it was distributed by Warner Home Video.\n\n"}

She had a younger sister, Isabelle (born 1924). Her ancestry consisted of Welsh, English, Scottish, French, and distant Dutch heritage; her paternal grandfather was an immigrant from Bedminster, Bristol in England, and many of her recent forebears had lived in Canada.\n\nHer childhood has been described as Dickensian. The family lived as boarders in a crowded house. The parents were dysfunctional and unhappy and sometimes prone to violent fights; they moved Dorothy around various schools, and paid only occasional attention to the children, before divorcing in 1927.\n\nThe children were then sent on a train by themselves, unsupervised (Dorothy was eight years old, Isabelle only three), to live with their paternal grandparents in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra, California. The sisters endured harsh and unloving treatment from their grandparents. The grandmother favored black Victorian dress and punished the girls for trifling acts. After Dorothy was caught trick-or-treating one Halloween, an activity the grandparents forbade, she was confined to her room for an entire year except for attending school, and was not even allowed to eat in the kitchen or play in the yard.\nHaving had enough, Dorothy left home at the young age of fourteen in the depths of the Great Depression, working as a housekeeper, cook, and nanny for a San Gabriel, California family, being paid $3 a week. Encouraged by her employer to read and go to school, Dorothy attended Alhambra High School, where she joined several clubs and benefited from two teachers. After graduating from Alhambra in 1937, she moved to Chicago for a failed reunion with her mother, who by then had married Max Rosenberg. Subsequently, she moved into her own apartment there and took office jobs to support herself. She later said, \"I'd hoped so hard that my mother would love me that I had to take the chance and find out. When she didn't, I had nowhere else to go.\" Hillary Rodham Clinton later attributed her interest in children's welfare to her mother's life as well as her belief that caring adults outside of family can fill a child's emotional voids.\n\nWhile applying for a job as a clerk typist at a textile company, she met a traveling salesman named Hugh Ellsworth Rodham, eight years her senior, in 1937. After a lengthy courtship, they married in early 1942.\n\nTheir first child and only daughter, Hillary, was born on Sunday October 26, 1947. At the time of her birth, they were living in a one-bedroom apartment in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago. The second child, a son named Hugh, was born in 1950 and during that year, the growing Rodham family moved into a two-story, three-bedroom house in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois. The couple's third child, a son named Tony, was born in 1954. Dorothy was a full-time homemaker.\n\nDorothy encouraged Hillary to have a love for learning and to pursue an education and a career, though she had never done so herself. As she later recalled, \"I never saw any difference in gender, as far as capabilities or aspirations were concerned. Just because [Hillary] was a girl didn't mean she should be limited.\" In contrast to her husband's staunch Republican views, Dorothy Rodham was, as her daughter later wrote, essentially a Democrat, \"although she kept it quiet in Republican Park Ridge.\" She taught Sunday school at the First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge.\n\nDuring the 1970s, once her children were grown up, Rodham took courses at Oakton Community College in a variety of subjects, receiving high grades and earning an associate's degree in liberal arts. She was among the first mothers of that generation to return to school. In 1987, Rodham and her husband moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, to be closer to their daughter and help care for their young granddaughter, Chelsea. She took courses in subjects that happened to interest her, focusing on psychology but including logic and child development, although she never gained a further degree. Her daughter later wrote in her 2003 memoir \"Living History\", \"I'm still amazed at how my mother emerged from her lonely early life as such an affectionate and levelheaded woman.\"\n\nHer husband Hugh Rodham died in 1993, shortly after their daughter became First Lady of the United States. Dorothy Rodham remained active but valued her privacy and almost never spoke to the media. She spent more time at the White House and accompanied Hillary and Chelsea on visits to France, India, and China; she also enjoyed life in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the 1996 Democratic National Convention, when Bill Clinton was nominated for re-election, she appeared in a video message, saying \"Everybody knows there is only one person in the world who can really tell the truth about a man, and that's his mother-in-law.\" Following the Lewinsky scandal she was reportedly angry at Bill, but encouraged Hillary to seek her own political career.\n\nWhen her daughter was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, she moved to Washington, D.C., living along Connecticut Avenue. She appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2004. Once living alone became too much for her, in 2006, she moved into the Clintons' large Whitehaven house in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C. There she would often sit and discuss the day when her daughter came home from work.\n\nStarting in December 2007, she made a rare public appearance in Iowa and other early primary states to campaign for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. She appeared at some events concerning women's issues and also appeared in a Clinton campaign television advertisement. She was in attendance when her daughter was sworn in as Secretary of State on January 21, 2009.\n\nIn her final years, her health began to fail due to heart problems.\n\nRodham died at George Washington University Hospital on November 1, 2011, in Washington, D.C., with Secretary Clinton cancelling a trip overseas, to be by her side; no cause was given. Other family members were present as well. A small memorial service was held for her at Whitehaven.\n\nThe William J. Clinton Presidential Center held an exhibit featuring Dorothy Howell Rodham and Virginia Dell Kelley, the mother of Bill Clinton, in 2012. It was introduced by a video from Chelsea Clinton in which she talked about the influence her grandmothers had had on her.\n\nIn her 2014 memoir \"Hard Choices\", Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote of Dorothy Howell Rodham, \"No one had a bigger influence on my life or did more to shape the person I became.\" The struggles that she went through became a major theme of the June 2015 kickoff event to Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. They were repeated when Clinton gave a victory speech upon becoming the Democratic nominee in early June 2016, saying, \"I wish she could see her daughter become the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.\"\n"}

In the main comic, Tech-Jacket joined the Viltrumite war. This was followed by a new comic book series which ran twelve issues (July 2014 to December 2015). All issues have been collected into 4 graphic novels.\n\nZack Thompson, a high school kid, finds a dying alien from a race of incredibly intelligent but physically weak beings called the Geldarians. To make up for this they have invented the Tech Jacket, a vest that every Geldarian is equipped with upon birth. Seeing the human and knowing his crashed spaceship is going to blow up and kill them both, the alien fits him with the Tech Jacket, saving his life. But now the Tech Jacket can't be removed and gives Zack \"the most powerful weapons in the universe\". After saving his father (who is therefore aware of the Tech Jacket), Zack tells him about the crashed spaceship and dying alien. Later, the Geldarians show up, thinking Zack killed their comrade Kelda (the alien) and stole the Tech Jacket. After helping the Geldarians fight the Kresh, the Geldarians felt grateful towards him.\n\nHe appeared in \"Invincible\" #71, working on a space station with his father. The station was implied to have been built by him. According to a conversation he had with Allen the Alien, he mainly involves himself in galactic events, and calls himself a \"galactic guardian\" instead of a superhero. He was recruited by Allen and Nolan to accompany them to fight against the Viltrumites. While on board a spaceship with Invincible, they were attacked by Conquest and two additional Viltrumites.\n\nFeatures\n\nAccording to Zack, because a human is already physically stronger than a Geldarian, he is more capable of using the tech jacket and is a natural with it. Additionally, in his most recent appearance, Zack has become physically stronger than in his original series, which implies that his tech jacket strength has increased as well.\n\n"}

Tartessia was rich in silver, like all of Iberia. Similar names (e.g. \"Argantoni\") appear in inscriptions of the Roman period in or near former Tartessian territory. A name or title \"Argantoda(nos)\" is found on silver coinage in Northern Gaul and may have had a meaning akin to \"treasurer\".

This idea of great age and length of reign may result from a succession of kings using the same name or title. Herodotus says that Arganthonios warmly welcomed the first Greeks to reach Iberia, a ship carrying Phocaeans, and urged them fruitlessly to settle in Iberia. Hearing that the Medes were becoming a dominant force in the neighbourhood of the Phocaeans, he gave the latter money to build a defensive wall about their town.

Merozoite surface proteins, or MSPs, are important in understanding malaria, a disease caused by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. During the asexual blood stage of its life cycle, the malaria parasite enters red blood cells to replicate itself, causing the classic symptoms of malaria. These surface protein complexes are involved in many interactions of the parasite with red blood cells and are therefore an important topic of study for scientists aiming to combat malaria. \n\nThe most common form of MSPs are anchored to the merozoite surface with glycophosphatidylinositol, a short glycolipid often used for protein anchoring. Additional forms include integral membrane proteins and peripherally associated proteins, which are found to a lesser extent than glycophosphatidylinositol anchored proteins, or (GPI)-anchored proteins, on the merozoite surface. Merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP-1 & MSP-2) are the most abundant (GPI)-anchored proteins on the surface of Plasmodium merozoites. \n\nMSP-1 is synthesized at the very beginning of schizogony, or asexual merozoite reproduction. The merozoite first attaches to a red blood cell using its MSP-1 complex. The MSP-1 complex targets spectrin, a complex on the internal surface of the cell membrane of a red blood cell. The majority of the MSP-1 complex is shed upon entry into the red blood cell, but a small portion of the C-terminus, called MSP-1, is conserved. The exact role of MSP-1 remains unknown, but it currently serves as a marker for the formation of the food vacuole. \n\nThe function of the MSP-2 complex is not concrete, but current research suggests it has a role in red blood cell invasion due to its degradation shortly after invasion. MSP- 3, 6, 7 and 9 are peripheral membrane proteins that have been shown to form a complex with MSP-1, but the functions of these proteins are largely unknown.\n\nDue to their prevalence on the Plasmodium surface, MSPs have been a key target for vaccine development. Anti-malarial vaccines have been developed to target the merozoite at different stages in its life cycle. Vaccines that target the merozoite in its asexual erythrocytic stage utilize merozoite surface proteins, particularly MSP-1. In addition to vaccines, researchers are developing drugs that bind to MSPs in order to disrupt merozoite replication. Suramin, a drug used to treat African sleeping sickness, has shown moderate success with binding to MSP-1 and its derivatives such as MSP-1 to inhibit red blood cell invasion.\n\nThe challenge faced when developing vaccines is the complexity and variation of these proteins. In merozoites of the same genus and species, the sequences encoding proteins such as MSP-1 vary depending on the region they are found. For example, the Combination B vaccine utilizes antigens of MSP-1 and MSP-2 but has limited efficacy based primarily on the MSP-2 alleles used. In an attempt to increase the efficiency of vaccines produced, constant regions such as MSP-1 which remain on the surface of the Plasmodium after the merozoite stage are becoming a key focus for vaccine studies. Additionally, synthetic glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) molecules are candidates since they elicit a strong immune response while simultaneously remaining relatively consistent in structure over various malarial strains.\n"}

{"id": "2203131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203131", "title": "Geomagnetic reversal", "text": "Geomagnetic reversal\n\nA geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged (not to be confused with geographic north and geographic south). The Earth's field has alternated between periods of \"normal\" polarity, in which the predominant direction of the field was the same as the present direction, and \"reverse\" polarity, in which it was the opposite. These periods are called \"chrons\".\n\nReversal occurrences are statistically random. There have been 183 reversals over the last 83 million years. The latest, the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred 780,000 years ago, with widely varying estimates of how quickly it happened. Other sources estimate that the time that it takes for a reversal to complete is on average around 7000 years for the four most recent reversals. Clement (2004) suggests that this duration is dependent on latitude, with shorter durations at low latitudes, and longer durations at mid and high latitudes. Although variable, the duration of a full reversal is typically between 2000 and 12000 years, which is one to two orders of magnitude less than the duration of magnetic chrons.\n\nAlthough there have been periods in which the field reversed globally (such as the Laschamp excursion) for several hundred years, these events are classified as excursions rather than full geomagnetic reversals. Stable polarity chrons often show large, rapid directional excursions, which occur more often than reversals, and could be seen as failed reversals. During such an excursion, the field reverses in the liquid outer core, but not in the solid inner core. Diffusion in the liquid outer core is on timescales of 500 years or less, while that of the solid inner core is longer, around 3000 years.\n\nIn the early 20th century, geologists such as Bernard Brunhes first noticed that some volcanic rocks were magnetized opposite to the direction of the local Earth's field. The first estimate of the timing of magnetic reversals was made by Motonori Matuyama in the 1920s; he observed that rocks with reversed fields were all of early Pleistocene age or older. At the time, the Earth's polarity was poorly understood, and the possibility of reversal aroused little interest.\n\nThree decades later, when Earth's magnetic field was better understood, theories were advanced suggesting that the Earth's field might have reversed in the remote past. Most paleomagnetic research in the late 1950s included an examination of the wandering of the poles and continental drift. Although it was discovered that some rocks would reverse their magnetic field while cooling, it became apparent that most magnetized volcanic rocks preserved traces of the Earth's magnetic field at the time the rocks had cooled. In the absence of reliable methods for obtaining absolute ages for rocks, it was thought that reversals occurred approximately every million years.\n\nThe next major advance in understanding reversals came when techniques for radiometric dating were improved in the 1950s. Allan Cox and Richard Doell, at the United States Geological Survey, wanted to know whether reversals occurred at regular intervals, and invited the geochronologist Brent Dalrymple to join their group. They produced the first magnetic-polarity time scale in 1959. As they accumulated data, they continued to refine this scale in competition with Don Tarling and Ian McDougall at the Australian National University. A group led by Neil Opdyke at the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory showed that the same pattern of reversals was recorded in sediments from deep-sea cores.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s information about variations in the Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels, but the complex routes of ocean cruises rendered the association of navigational data with magnetometer readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared on the ocean floors.\n\nIn 1963, Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews provided a simple explanation by combining the seafloor spreading theory of Harry Hess with the known time scale of reversals: new sea floor is magnetized in the direction of the then-current field. Thus, sea floor spreading from a central ridge will produce pairs of magnetic stripes parallel to the ridge. Canadian L. W. Morley independently proposed a similar explanation in January 1963, but his work was rejected by the scientific journals \"Nature\" and \"Journal of Geophysical Research\", and remained unpublished until 1967, when it appeared in the literary magazine \"Saturday Review\". The Morley–Vine–Matthews hypothesis was the first key scientific test of the seafloor spreading theory of continental drift.\n\nBeginning in 1966, Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory scientists found that the magnetic profiles across the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge were symmetrical and matched the pattern in the north Atlantic's Reykjanes ridge. The same magnetic anomalies were found over most of the world's oceans, which permitted estimates for when most of the oceanic crust had developed.\n\nPast field reversals can be and have been recorded in the \"frozen\" ferromagnetic (or, more accurately, ferrimagnetic) minerals of consolidated sedimentary deposits or cooled volcanic flows on land.\n\nThe past record of geomagnetic reversals was first noticed by observing the magnetic stripe \"anomalies\" on the ocean floor. Lawrence W. Morley, Frederick John Vine and Drummond Hoyle Matthews made the connection to seafloor spreading in the Morley–Vine–Matthews hypothesis which soon led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics. The relatively constant rate at which the sea floor spreads results in substrate \"stripes\" from which past magnetic field polarity can be inferred from data gathered from towing a magnetometer along the sea floor.\n\nBecause no existing unsubducted sea floor (or sea floor thrust onto continental plates) is more than about (Ma) old, other methods are necessary for detecting older reversals. Most sedimentary rocks incorporate tiny amounts of iron rich minerals, whose orientation is influenced by the ambient magnetic field at the time at which they formed. These rocks can preserve a record of the field if it is not later erased by chemical, physical or biological change.\n\nBecause the magnetic field is global, similar patterns of magnetic variations at different sites may be used to correlate age in different locations. In the past four decades much paleomagnetic data about seafloor ages (up to ~) has been collected and is useful in estimating the age of geologic sections. Not an independent dating method, it depends on \"absolute\" age dating methods like radioisotopic systems to derive numeric ages. It has become especially useful to metamorphic and igneous geologists where index fossils are seldom available.\n\nThrough analysis of seafloor magnetic anomalies and dating of reversal sequences on land, paleomagnetists have been developing a \"Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale\" (GPTS). The current time scale contains 184 polarity intervals in the last 83million years (and therefore 183 reversals).\n\nThe rate of reversals in the Earth's magnetic field has varied widely over time. , the field reversed 5 times in a million years. In a 4-million-year period centered on , there were 10 reversals; at around , 17 reversals took place in the span of 3million years. In a period of 3million years centering on , 13 reversals occurred. No fewer than 51 reversals occurred in a 12-million-year period, centering on . Two reversals occurred during a span of 50,000 years. These eras of frequent reversals have been counterbalanced by a few \"superchrons\" – long periods when no reversals took place.\n\nA \"superchron\" is a polarity interval lasting at least 10million years. There are two well-established superchrons, the Cretaceous Normal and the Kiaman. A third candidate, the Moyero, is more controversial. The Jurassic Quiet Zone in ocean magnetic anomalies was once thought to represent a superchron, but is now attributed to other causes.\n\nThe \"Cretaceous Normal\" (also called the \"Cretaceous Superchron\" or C34) lasted for almost 40million years, from about , including stages of the Cretaceous period from the Aptian through the Santonian. The frequency of magnetic reversals steadily decreased prior to the period, reaching its low point (no reversals) during the period. Between the Cretaceous Normal and the present, the frequency has generally increased slowly.\n\nThe \"Kiaman Reverse Superchron\" lasted from approximately the late Carboniferous to the late Permian, or for more than 50million years, from around . The magnetic field had reversed polarity. The name \"Kiaman\" derives from the Australian village of Kiama, where some of the first geological evidence of the superchron was found in 1925.\n\nThe Ordovician is suspected to have hosted another superchron, called the \"Moyero Reverse Superchron\", lasting more than 20million years (485 to 463million years ago). Thus far, this possible superchron has only been found in the Moyero river section north of the polar circle in Siberia. Moreover, the best data from elsewhere in the world do not show evidence for this superchron.\n\nCertain regions of ocean floor, older than , have low-amplitude magnetic anomalies that are hard to interpret. They are found off the east coast of North America, the northwest coast of Africa, and the western Pacific. They were once thought to represent a superchron called the \"Jurassic Quiet Zone\", but magnetic anomalies are found on land during this period. The geomagnetic field is known to have low intensity between about and , and these sections of ocean floor are especially deep, causing the geomagnetic signal to be attenuated between the seabed and the surface.\n\nSeveral studies have analyzed the statistical properties of reversals in the hope of learning something about their underlying mechanism. The discriminating power of statistical tests is limited by the small number of polarity intervals. Nevertheless, some general features are well established. In particular, the pattern of reversals is random. There is no correlation between the lengths of polarity intervals. There is no preference for either normal or reversed polarity, and no statistical difference between the distributions of these polarities. This lack of bias is also a robust prediction of dynamo theory.\n\nThere is no \"rate\" of reversals, as they are statistically random. The randomness of the reversals is inconsistent with periodicity, but several authors have claimed to find periodicity. However, these results are probably artifacts of an analysis using sliding windows to attempt to determine reversal rates.\n\nMost statistical models of reversals have analyzed them in terms of a Poisson process or other kinds of renewal process. A Poisson process would have, on average, a constant reversal rate, so it is common to use a non-stationary Poisson process. However, compared to a Poisson process, there is a reduced probability of reversal for tens of thousands of years after a reversal. This could be due to an inhibition in the underlying mechanism, or it could just mean that some shorter polarity intervals have been missed. A random reversal pattern with inhibition can be represented by a gamma process. In 2006, a team of physicists at the University of Calabria found that the reversals also conform to a Lévy distribution, which describes stochastic processes with long-ranging correlations between events in time. The data are also consistent with a deterministic, but chaotic, process.\n\nMost estimates for the duration of a polarity transition are between 1,000 and 10,000 years, but some estimates are as quick as a human lifetime. Studies of 16.7-million-year-old lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the Earth's magnetic field is capable of shifting at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day. This was initially met with skepticism from paleomagnetists. Even if changes occur that quickly in the core, the mantle, which is a semiconductor, is thought to remove variations with periods less than a few months. A variety of possible rock magnetic mechanisms were proposed that would lead to a false signal. However, paleomagnetic studies of other sections from the same region (the Oregon Plateau flood basalts) give consistent results. It appears that the reversed-to-normal polarity transition that marks the end of Chron C5Cr () contains a series of reversals and excursions. In addition, geologists Scott Bogue of Occidental College and Jonathan Glen of the US Geological Survey, sampling lava flows in Battle Mountain, Nevada, found evidence for a brief, several-year-long interval during a reversal when the field direction changed by over 50 degrees. The reversal was dated to approximately 15million years ago. In August 2018, researchers reported a reversal lasting only 200 years. But a 2019 paper estimated that the most recent reversal, 780,000 years ago, lasted 22,000 years.\n\nThe magnetic field will not vanish completely, but many poles might form chaotically in different places during reversal, until it stabilizes again.\n\nThe magnetic field of the Earth, and of other planets that have magnetic fields, is generated by dynamo action in which convection of molten iron in the planetary core generates electric currents which in turn give rise to magnetic fields. In simulations of planetary dynamos, reversals often emerge spontaneously from the underlying dynamics. For example, Gary Glatzmaier and collaborator Paul Roberts of UCLA ran a numerical model of the coupling between electromagnetism and fluid dynamics in the Earth's interior. Their simulation reproduced key features of the magnetic field over more than 40,000 years of simulated time and the computer-generated field reversed itself. Global field reversals at irregular intervals have also been observed in the laboratory liquid metal experiment \"VKS2\".\n\nIn some simulations, this leads to an instability in which the magnetic field spontaneously flips over into the opposite orientation. This scenario is supported by observations of the solar magnetic field, which undergoes spontaneous reversals every 9–12 years. However, with the Sun it is observed that the solar magnetic intensity greatly increases during a reversal, whereas reversals on Earth seem to occur during periods of low field strength.\n\nSome scientists, such as Richard A. Muller, think that geomagnetic reversals are not spontaneous processes but rather are triggered by external events that directly disrupt the flow in the Earth's core. Proposals include impact events or internal events such as the arrival of continental slabs carried down into the mantle by the action of plate tectonics at subduction zones or the initiation of new mantle plumes from the core-mantle boundary. Supporters of this hypothesis hold that any of these events could lead to a large scale disruption of the dynamo, effectively turning off the geomagnetic field. Because the magnetic field is stable in either the present North-South orientation or a reversed orientation, they propose that when the field recovers from such a disruption it spontaneously chooses one state or the other, such that half the recoveries become reversals. However, the proposed mechanism does not appear to work in a quantitative model, and the evidence from stratigraphy for a correlation between reversals and impact events is weak. There is no evidence for a reversal connected with the impact event that caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.\n\nShortly after the first geomagnetic polarity time scales were produced, scientists began exploring the possibility that reversals could be linked to extinctions. Most such proposals rest on the assumption that the Earth's magnetic field would be much weaker during reversals. Possibly the first such hypothesis was that high-energy particles trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt could be liberated and bombard the Earth. Detailed calculations confirm that if the Earth's dipole field disappeared entirely (leaving the quadrupole and higher components), most of the atmosphere would become accessible to high-energy particles, but would act as a barrier to them, and cosmic ray collisions would produce secondary radiation of beryllium-10 or chlorine-36. A 2012 German study of Greenland ice cores showed a peak of beryllium-10 during a brief complete reversal 41,000 years ago, which led to the magnetic field strength dropping to an estimated 5% of normal during the reversal. There is evidence that this occurs both during secular variation and during reversals.\n\nAnother hypothesis by McCormac and Evans assumes that the Earth's field disappears entirely during reversals. They argue that the atmosphere of Mars may have been eroded away by the solar wind because it had no magnetic field to protect it. They predict that ions would be stripped away from Earth's atmosphere above 100 km. However, paleointensity measurements show that the magnetic field has not disappeared during reversals. Based on paleointensity data for the last 800,000 years, the magnetopause is still estimated to have been at about three Earth radii during the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal. Even if the internal magnetic field did disappear, the solar wind can induce a magnetic field in the Earth's ionosphere sufficient to shield the surface from energetic particles.\n\nHypotheses have also advanced toward linking reversals to mass extinctions. Many such arguments were based on an apparent periodicity in the rate of reversals, but more careful analyses show that the reversal record is not periodic.\nIt may be, however, that the ends of superchrons have caused vigorous convection leading to widespread volcanism, and that the subsequent airborne ash caused extinctions.\n\nTests of correlations between extinctions and reversals are difficult for a number of reasons. Larger animals are too scarce in the fossil record for good statistics, so paleontologists have analyzed microfossil extinctions. Even microfossil data can be unreliable if there are hiatuses in the fossil record. It can appear that the extinction occurs at the end of a polarity interval when the rest of that polarity interval was simply eroded away. Statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between reversals and extinctions.\n\n\n"}

The ruins of the mission are located in present-day Ejido La Misión, Baja California in the municipio of Ensenada. The mission ruins are behind the local school, on the north side of Highway 1.\n\nIt was near this place that, in 1773, a large cross was erected to indicate the boundary of missionary responsibilities in Las Californias between Franciscans (north) and Dominicans (south). Franciscan missionary Francisco Palóu, on his way to San Diego, supervised the operation. In 1804, the same line was used to divide Las Californias into separate provinces of Alta California and Baja California. Today's border between the United States and Mexico is about to the north.\n\nThe mission was built with the support of six soldiers from the Presidio of San Diego and five others probably from Mission San Vicente. They had just begun to build the first houses and plant the first crops when the neighboring San Juan Bautista Creek ran dry. This forced them to move the mission to a new site called San Juan Bautista, 10 km upstream, where there was a good supply of water.\n\nThe enclosure was rectangular, with the church and the residential quarters facing east and south. It had an open patio, the only entrance to which was a large door located in the southeast corner of the complex, protected by a barrack. The complex also included an irrigation ditch, four granaries, two houses, a corral, and three other rooms.\n\nThe buildings of the complex were made of adobe, with round stone foundations, set at a depth of 90 cm, cemented with a mortar of clay, sand, and lime. The adobe bricks resting on the foundation were cemented with the same mortar and placed in an alternating fashion to give the structure more strength and stability, making walls from 0.9 to 1.1 m thick. The adobe was made with local soil, water, clay, sand, and straw to make it more resistant.\n\nThe walls probably reached a height of 4.5 m, and the roofs were interlaced with tule branches possibly over beams or with adobe tile. The floors were made of flooring tile.\n\nThis Mission is located at the base of a mountain, surrounded by meadows and hills, crossed by the San Juan Bautista stream, also known as the Guadalupe River. Further downhill this stream joins the sea, forming an estuary rich in diverse types of plants and animals, such as white herons and wild ducks.\n\nThe missionaries wrote in their diaries about finding plentiful pasture in the area and further inland as well as watercress, chia, mangrove, cattail, brushwood, a few isolated pines, yucca, mesquite, sycamores, chamomile, willows, and evergreen oaks.\n\nThe native animals that inhabited the region were coyotes, bobcats, beavers, moles, rabbits, squirrels, rats, and mice, among others. There were also marine species such as sea bass, corbina, tuna, sardine, \"boga\" octopus, abalone, clam, and mussel.\n\nThe humidity at San Miguel Arcángel de la Frontera favored the development of cattle herds. According to the missionaries' reports, they had more than 3,000 head of cattle, goats, and sheep, as well as 400 horses and mules in the meadows.\n\nAgricultural crops included wheat, maize, cantaloupe, watermelon, beans, lentils, vegetables, grapes, and barley.\n\nConservation efforts at San Miguel form part of the \"Camino Real Misionero de las Californias\" program of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). Foundations of the eroded walls have been consolidated. Rain gutters have been built to divert the water and prevent its concentration at the base of the remains. One of the walls has been shored. The remains of the walls are covered by a layer made of clay, sand, water, slices of nopal cactus, and manure to protect them from the wind, sunlight, and rain.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2203144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203144", "title": "WCIA", "text": "WCIA\n\nWCIA, virtual channel 3 (UHF digital channel 34), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Champaign, Illinois, United States and serving the Central Illinois region. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with Springfield-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WCIX (channel 49). The two stations share studios on South Neil Street/US 45 in downtown Champaign and also operate a sales office and news bureau on East Edwards Street near the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield. WCIA's transmitter is located west of Seymour along the Champaign–Piatt county line. \n\nSince WCIA's over-the-air signal cannot be seen in western parts of the market (including Springfield and Jacksonville), it is simulcast in high definition on WCIX's second digital subchannel (VHF channel 13.2 or virtual channel 49.2 via PSIP) from a transmitter on Etherton Lane in Clear Lake Township. Nielsen Media Research treats WCIA and WCIX-DT2 as one station in local ratings books, using the identifier name WCIA+.\n\nThe station's first broadcast was on November 14, 1953, and it was owned and operated by Midwest Television, headquartered in Champaign. August C. Meyer Sr., a lawyer and chairman of the board of the Champaign-based Bank of Illinois, founded Midwest Television in 1952. Meyer expanded the company's footprint by buying WMBD-AM–FM–TV in Peoria, Illinois, in 1960 and KFMB-AM–FM–TV in San Diego, California, in 1964. Midwest sold off controlling interest in its Illinois television holdings to Nexstar in 1999. That company acquired Midwest's remaining interest in the Illinois stations in 2001.\n\nWCIA was a primary CBS affiliate, carrying secondary affiliations with NBC and DuMont. DuMont shut down in 1956 and WCIA dropped NBC in 1959 when WCHU-TV (now WICD) started. It also carried a few ABC shows during the 1953–1954 television season.\n\nAs the only commercial VHF station in Central Illinois, WCIA has been one of the country's most dominant television stations for most of its history. On two occasions, it fought off attempts by WICS/WICD and WAND to force it onto the UHF band by claiming that moving to UHF would cause it to lose 150,000 viewers.\n\nDespite its dominance of the market, WCIA provides only a Grade B signal to the Springfield area. Meyer realized early on that Champaign/Urbana and Springfield/Decatur were going to be one giant television market. He originally wanted to build WCIA's tower in White Heath, roughly halfway between Champaign and Decatur. The tower would have been placed on some of the highest ground in Central Illinois. However, just after construction began, Prairie Television (owner of WTVP, now WAND) filed an objection. Prairie claimed WCIA was encroaching on its territory. To avoid delays, WCIA moved its transmitter to the current location in Seymour. Despite this, Decatur (the second-largest city in the western half of the market) receives WCIA's signal very well.\n\nWhile it frequently trounced WICS/WICD and WAND in the ratings, Meyer decided to open a low-powered relay of WCIA on UHF channel 49 to get better coverage in the state capital. In 1985, this became full-powered station WCFN. In 2002, WCFN separated from WCIA and became the area's UPN affiliate. To make up for the shortfall in coverage, WCIA was added to WCFN's digital subcarrier, while WCFN was added to WCIA's digital subcarrier. However, few people lost access to either station due to the extremely high penetration of cable and satellite in the area.\n\nFor decades, WCIA was available on Bloomington–Normal cable systems, in the Peoria market, along with sister station WMBD-TV. In March 2000, shortly after Nexstar bought controlling interest in both stations, it announced it would pull WCIA from AT&T Cable Services (now Comcast Xfinity) in that area due to competition. The move would make WMBD the only CBS affiliate and mean that it would not have to share advertisers with or lose ratings points to WCIA. A group of outraged residents called \"Citizens to Keep WCIA on-the-air\" started a group that protested against Nexstar. Nexstar did not listen and eventually dropped WCIA from Bloomington–Normal area cable systems. However, WCIA's Grade B signal had always covered the Bloomington–Normal area on analog VHF channel 3 and its digital signal on UHF channel 48 also covers the same area, meaning that Bloomington–Normal residents can still receive WCIA over-the-air. The WCIA analog and digital signals both have coverage areas that extend as far west as Morton.\n\nIn November 2006 work began to re-secure WCIA's existing tower in Seymour so it would be able to hold a new digital transmission line and antenna.\n\nWCIA was the longtime home to Illinois Fighting Illini football and men's basketball games that were not aired on national television. Originally produced by WCIA, the station later carried the Illini via the Big Ten Conference's syndicated package with ESPN Plus. Beginning in 2007, these games have since moved to the Big Ten Network. The station still airs Illini men's basketball games that are carried by the CBS network.\n\nIn 2009, WCIA's longtime weathercaster Judy Fraser retired from the station after 34 years. She was only the second head weathercaster in the station's history at the time. Meteorologist Robert Reese took over as Chief Meteorologist. His death in connection with complications from cancer in October 2012 came as a shock to the community. In his early battle, WCIA sold red ribbons in support of Reese and the American Cancer Society.\n\nOn September 11, 2014, WCIA anchor Dave Benton announced on-air that he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and that he had only months to live. He explained that the doctors told him that his cancer had returned and that it was too large for surgery or radiation. Benton was diagnosed with a glioblastoma in November 2013 after doctors found a tumor on the left side of his head. He underwent surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy and completed radiation treatment in February 2014. On April 13, 2015, Benton announced on the 6 p.m. newscast that he was stepping down from the anchor chair due to continued health issues and failed treatments, though he hoped to continue his signature crime reports for the 5 p.m. news as long as his health allowed. Benton died at home on May 26.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal—which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019—would result in WCIA and WCIX gaining additional sister stations in nearby markets including Chicago (independent station WGN-TV) and St. Louis (Fox affiliate KTVI and CW affiliate KPLR-TV). (Ownership conflicts existed in two existing Nexstar markets involving Nexstar's duopoly of CW affiliate WISH-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WNDY-TV (which were both sold to Circle City Broadcasting) and Tribune's duopoly of Fox affiliate WXIN and CBS affiliate WTTV/WTTK in Indianapolis and Nexstar's virtual triopoly of CBS affiliate WHBF-TV, CW affiliate KGCW and Fox-affiliated SSA partner KLJB and Tribune-owned ABC affiliate WQAD-TV (which was sold to Tegna) in the Quad Cities.) The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nOriginally, WCFN/WCIX aired its digital signal in a reduced 480i standard definition format on both its main channel and the digital subcarrier of WCIA. In June 2015, WCIX upgraded to a full 1080i high definition signal, the same as WCIA. In September 2016, WCIA begin broadcasting Bounce TV on 3.3 and Grit TV on 3.4.\n\nWCIA shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 48. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 3. On January 17, 2020, WCIA moved to channel 34 as a result of the spectrum repack.\n\nWCIA currently broadcasts its news from its studios in Champaign. It currently broadcasts 40 hours of news a week, and one hour on Saturday and Sunday. For most of its history, it has been central Illinois' dominant news station, owing to its status as the market's only VHF station.\n\nOn September 12, 2011, WCIA debuted an hour-long lifestyle and news program titled \"ciLiving.tv\", the Springfield market's first hour-long 4 p.m. news program; the show utilizes interactivity with viewers, through the use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, along with online polls and audience quizzes via text message and the station's website. The show also utilizes the station's new set, which is also used for the station's morning show, as well as other programs.\n\nOn October 24, 2012 during the 5:00 p.m. newscast, WCIA and sister station WCIX began broadcasting local news in high definition. This made the WCIA/WCIX operation the third local news operation and second \"Big Four\" network affiliated station to have made the upgrade. However, the newscasts on WCIX continued to be seen over the air in a letterboxed format until June 19, 2015 because its main channel was still transmitted in 4:3 standard definition until it upgraded to HD on that date.\n\nIn April 2015, WCIA expanded its 6 p.m. newscast from 30 minutes to one hour to provide better coverage of local news.\n\nIn late 2015, WCIA expanded its news coverage from the State Capitol. The station now produces and airs \"Capitol Connection\" on Sunday mornings after CBS' \"Face the Nation\". The show is also carried on other Nexstar stations in Illinois. \n\nIn October 2016, WCIA expanded its morning show from four hours to five hours, making the station have the only local news at 9 a.m. in the market. \n\nIn an article published on March 13, 2005, \"The New York Times\" documented WCIA's use of government video news releases. \"The Times\" reported, \"WCIA, based in Champaign, had run 26 segments made by the U.S. Agriculture Department over the past three months alone.\" WCIA acknowledged running the releases in the early hours of its morning news as a service to local farmers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2203151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203151", "title": "Madison Symmetric Torus", "text": "Madison Symmetric Torus\n\nThe Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) is a reversed field pinch (RFP) physics experiment with applications to both fusion energy research and astrophysical plasmas located at University of Wisconsin-Madison. RFPs are significantly different from tokamaks (the most popular magnetic confinement scheme) in that they tend to have a higher power density and better confinement characteristics for a given average magnetic field. RFPs also tend to be dominated by non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects. MST is one of the sites in the Center for Magnetic Self Organization (CMSO).\n\nAs in most such experiments the MST plasma is a toroidal pinch, which means the plasma is shaped like a donut and confined by a magnetic field generated by a large current flowing through it. MST falls into an unconventional class of machine called a reversed field pinch (RFP.) The RFP is so named because the toroidal magnetic field that permeates the plasma spontaneously reverses direction near the edge.\n\nA reversed field pinch is formed similarly to other toroidal pinch devices, by driving current through the plasma from an associated capacitor bank or other high-current power source. In a tokamak the toroidal field is much stronger than the poloidal field, but in an RFP it's just the opposite. In fact, in an RFP the externally applied toroidal field is switched off shortly after startup. The plasma in an RFP is also much closer to the wall than in a Tokamak. This permits a peculiar arrangement of the magnetic field lines, which will 'relax' into a new state such that the total magnetic energy in the plasma is minimized and the total magnetic helicity is conserved. The relaxed state, called a Taylor state, is marked by a peculiar arrangement of magnetic field lines where the toroidal magnetic field at the edge spontaneously reverses direction.\n\nLike most toroidal confinement schemes, the RFP relies on a transient burst of current to create the plasma and the magnetic fields that confine it. But for the RFP to be a viable fusion energy candidate the plasma must be sustained by a steady state current source. OFCD is a scheme for driving a steady current in a relaxed plasma by adding sizable oscillating perturbations to the toroidal and poloidal fields injecting both power and helicity into the plasma.\n\nA nonlinear reaction in the plasma combines the two oscillations in such a way that, on average, a steady\ncurrent is maintained.\n\nOne of the challenges facing the RFP is fueling the hot core of the plasma directly, rather than relying on the deuterium gas\nto seep in slowly from the edge. The Pellet Injector fires a frozen pellet of deuterium into the plasma using a blast of gas or\na mechanical punch. The pellet is vaporized and ionized as it travels into the core of the plasma.\n\nEvery gradient is a source of free energy, especially if it's across a magnetic field. In MST the current is stronger\nin the core than at the edge. This peaked current profile serves as a source of free energy for magnetic fluctuations\nculminating in violent events in the plasma called sawteeth.\n\nPPCD alleviates this effect by driving a current at the edge of the plasma, flattening the current profile. Small pulses\nare added to the power supply currents that drive the toroidal field. The resultant pulsed toroidal magnetic field,\nwith the aid of Faraday's law, creates a poloidal electric field and hence a poloidal current. A great deal of research on MST is devoted to the study of this effect and its application for enhanced confinement.\n\nIn order to initiate a sustained fusion reaction, it is usually necessary to use many methods to heat the plasma. Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) involves injecting a high energy beam of neutral atoms, typically hydrogen or deuterium, into the core of the plasma. These energetic atoms transfer their energy to the plasma, raising the overall temperature. The neutral atoms injected don't remain neutral. As the beam passes through the plasma, the atoms are ionized as they bounce off the ions in the plasma. Because the magnetic field inside the torus is bent into a circle, the fast ions are hoped to be confined in the background plasma. The confined fast ions are slowed down by the background plasma, the same way air resistance slows down a baseball. The energy transfer from the fast ions to the plasma increases the plasma temperature.\nThe actual injector can be seen from the observation window. It looks like a long silver cylinder laying on its side but tilted slightly downward against the torus near the back of the machine. When the injector is pulsed, 20,000 volts accelerates the beam to about 30 amperes of current for about 1.5 milliseconds.\n\nProblems would occur if the fast ions aren't confined within the plasma long enough for them to deposit their energy. Magnetic fluctuations bedevil plasma confinement in this type of device by scrambling what we hoped were well behaved magnetic fields. If the fast ions are susceptible to this type of behavior, they can escape very quickly. However, there is evidence to suggest that they aren't.\n\nEBW is an acronym for Electron Bernstein Wave and is named after the plasma physicist, Ira Bernstein.\n\nBernstein Wave Mode relates to a method of injecting ion or electron energy (IBW or EBW) into a plasma to increase its temperature in an attempt to reach fusion conditions. A plasma is a phase of matter which occurs naturally during lightning and electrical discharges and which is created artificially in fusion reactors to produce extremely high temperatures.\n\nA definition may be found in the Laurence Livermore Plasma dictionary.\n\nThis is an experiment on the MST to heat the plasma and to drive electric current inside the plasma.\n\nThere is a large electric current in the plasma inside this machine; it is responsible for creating the necessary magnetic fields to make the reversed field pinch configuration. It also heats the plasma very quickly — the same way wires inside your toaster get hot. Your toaster probably uses about 10 ampere of current, while the plasma in MST is heated by up to 600,000 amperes. But even though the plasma reaches over 10,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it is not hot enough for practical fusion energy and we need to find other ways to deposit energy into the plasma. The EBW is a way to inject microwave power to further heat the plasma. The standard microwave oven produces around 1 kW of power at a frequency of 2.45 GHz; the EBW experiment is currently producing 150 kW at 3.6 GHz, and it is a goal of the team to upgrade to over 2 MW. To generate this type of power (on a low budget), decommissioned military radar equipment and home-made voltage power supplies are used.\n\nThe second (and perhaps more scientifically important) goal of the EBW experiment is to drive electric current in a prescribed place within the plasma. The main plasma current distributes itself naturally, and the plasma tends to concentrate current into the center, leaving less current near the edge. This can lead to instability of the plasma. It has been shown (both theoretically and by experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus) that driving current in the edge makes the plasma more stable to fluctuations in the magnetic field, resulting in better confinement of the hot plasma and leading to much higher temperature. Using the EBW to drive this stabilizing current would be a very important scientific result. The ability to deposit very specifically the auxiliary current gives us the opportunity to optimize our current drive schemes. The heating is also very localized, allowing us to study how hot (at least locally) the plasma can become within this magnetic confinement scheme — in plasma physics terms, this is called finding the beta limit. This is an unanswered question for the RFP and will give insight on whether or not this type of machine could be scaled up to a cost-effective, efficient fusion reactor.\n\nThe Heavy Ion Beam Probe (HIBP) fires potassium ions into the plasma. By measuring their trajectory we get a profile of\nseveral key properties inside the plasma.\n\nThis versatile diagnostics tool has been used in magnetic confinement fusion experiments to\ndetermine the electric potential, electron density, electron temperature, and magnetic vector potential of the plasma.\n\nA stream of sodium ions (the primary beam) is injected from the ion gun across the magnetic field\ninto the plasma. As the singly charged particles pass through the plasma, they are further ionized creating\nthe doubly charged secondary beam.\n\nThe secondaries are then detected and analyzed outside the plasma. By curving the trajectories, the magnetic field separates secondary\nions from primary ions. Because of this, only secondaries ionized at a given plasma position reach a given detector location.\nThis allows the HIBP to make measurements localized to the ionization position.\nThe secondary current is related to local electron density and the ionization cross-section of the primary ions, which is itself\na function of the electron temperature. The electric potential can be obtained from the energy difference between primary and secondary\nion beams. The energy of the secondary beam can be determined from the angle at which it enters the energy analyzer.\n\nThe MST-HIBP system consists of:\n\n\nFIR, or Far Infrared, refers to light with wavelengths between 1 and 10 mm. The FIR system in MST is based on the FIR lasers enclosed in the beige-colored laser safety room to the right of the picture shown, in the second floor hallway.\nThere are four FIR lasers in the system. One is a CO laser which produces a continuous power of about 120 W. This beam is then split in three. Each beam optically pumps a Formic Acid vapor laser operating at a wavelength of 432.6 mm, and a power of about 20 mW. The FIR system has 2 modes of operation: interferometry and polarimetry.\n\nWhat does FIR diagnostic system measure?\n\nThe electron density, plasma current density, and magnetic field are three important plasma parameters of MST.\nThe FIR system is used to measure their spatial and temporal distributions.\n\nHow does FIR interferometry work?\n\nLike glass, a plasma has a refractive index different from that of vacuum (or air) that depends on plasma electron density.\nWe send one laser beam through the plasma (the probe beam), one through the air (the reference beam), and measure the phase difference\nbetween them. This experimental configuration is called a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The measured phase\nis proportional to the average plasma electron density along the beam path.\n\nIn MST, we send multiple probe beams (blue lines in the figure) through the plasma at different radii. We then apply the\nso-called Abel inversion technique to obtain a profile of the plasma electron density.\n\nHow does FIR polarimetry work?\n\nA plasma is also an optically active media, meaning when a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is propagating parallel (or anti-parallel)\nto the magnetic field, the polarization of the wave exiting the plasma will rotate a small angle.\nThis is called Faraday rotation, and the angle is called the Faraday rotation angle. The FIR\nsystem measures the Faraday rotation, which is proportional to the line average of the electron density times the magnetic\nfield component parallel to the beam path.\n\nThe reason for Faraday rotation is as follows: When a linearly polarized wave is propagating along a magnetic field line,\nit is de-composed into left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized components. The phase difference between them as they\nexit the plasma causes the recombined linearly polarized wave to rotate its polarization direction. In MST, we launch two co-propagating, counter-rotating waves to probe the plasma. We then measure the phase difference between these two beams, which will be twice the Faraday rotation angle.\n\nIn the figure, each of the 11 blue probe beams is a combination of two counter-rotating, circularly polarized beams, measuring the Faraday rotation angles along the same chords as the interferometer does. The combined interferometer phases and Faraday rotation angles can then be combined to determine the poloidal magnetic field distribution. Using Ampere's law, the toroidal plasma current can be determined as well.\n\nHow well does the FIR diagnostic system work?\n\nThe FIR system for MST is very precise. The Faraday rotation angle for MST plasmas is typically\nwithin 5 degrees. To measure such small signal, we have achieved an accuracy of 0.06 degree. The temporal resolution is less than 1 microsecond.\n\nWhat are some of the research topics related to FIR?\n\nFIR is an essential tool for most of the research topics in MST since it provides information about the basic plasma parameters. The system measures electron density, toroidal current, poloidal magnetic field, and the spatial profiles of each.\n\nCurrently, we are exploring the possibility of measuring toroidal magnetic field and poloidal plasma current by using the\nplasma bi-refringence effect, or the Cotton-Mouton effect. When a linearly polarized EM wave is propagating perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field, the refractive index depends on whether the wave polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield direction.\n\nWhy choose FIR lasers?\n\nFor plasma polarimetry-interferometry, the wavelength we chose is sufficiently long to provide measurable plasma induced phase changes, but sufficiently short to avoid\ncomplicated plasma-wave interactions, including the bending of the beam. There are many high power molecular laser lines available in this wavelength range, and many commercially available detectors.\n\nWhat is Thomson Scattering?\n\nThomson scattering is the result of a collision between a photon (an electromagnetic wave) and a charged particle, such as an electron. When an electron and photon \"collide\" the electron feels a Lorentz force from the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the photon and is accelerated. This acceleration causes the electron to emit a different photon in a different direction. This emitted photon has a wavelength shifted from that of the incident photon by an amount dependent on the electron energy. Another way of looking at this is that the electron absorbs the energy of the photon and re emits the energy in the form of a different electromagnetic wave. This scattering of a photon by an electron is called Thomson Scattering.\n\nHow is Thomson Scattering useful to plasma physicists?\n\nSince the wavelength of the scattered photon depends on the energy of the scattering electron, Thomson scattering is good way to measure the energy of an electron. This is done by creating a photon of known wavelength and measuring the wavelength of the scattered photon. The Thomson Scattering configuration at MST uses a 1064 nm Nd:YAG Laser System, which produces the best time-resolution electron temperature readings in the world. We create our photons with high power lasers that we shine into a window on the top of the MST, and collect scattered photons with a large collection lens on the side of the MST.\n\nThe wavelength distribution of the scattered photons tells us the energy distribution of the electrons in the plasma, giving us a direct unobtrusive way of getting the temperature of the electrons. The amount of photons we actually collect can also tell us something about the density of the electrons in the plasma.\n\nFusion plasmas are typically generated from ionization of a neutral gas. In most cases, an isotope of hydrogen — called deuterium — is used as the plasma fuel. These plasmas are therefore primarily made up of deuterium ions (plus electrons), and it is necessary to diagnose the behavior of these ions if the relevant plasma physics is to be understood. However, in any fusion device, other types of ions (\"impurities\") are also present. These exist naturally due to the inability to achieve a perfect vacuum in a fusion reactor before fueling. Thus, materials such as water vapor, nitrogen, and carbon will be found in small amounts in typical plasma discharges. Impurities may also be generated during plasma discharges due to plasma-wall interactions. These interactions primarily cause material from the wall to be ejected into the plasma through sputtering. In the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST), properties of the impurity ions (e.g. carbon, oxygen, etc.) are closely linked to properties of the deuterium ions as a result of strong interaction between the ion species. Thus, impurity ion measurements can, in principle, provide direct information about the deuterium ions. Measurements of the impurity ion temperature (\"T\") and flow velocity (\"v\") are obtained on MST using Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy, or CHERS.\n\nThe CHERS process can be broken down into two separate steps: Charge Exchange and Radiative Decay. In the first stage, an electron is transferred from a neutral atom (e.g. deuterium) to an impurity ion that has no electrons (e.g. C).\nDuring this transfer, the electron typically winds up in an excited state (high energy level) of the impurity ion. As the electron decays down to the ground state (minimum energy level), energy conservation requires radiation to be emitted by the impurity ion. This emission has discrete values of energy, or wavelength, which correspond to the energy differences between the initial and final atomic levels of a particular electron transition. For example, consider charge exchange between a deuterium atom and a C ion: if the electron is transferred to the \"n\"=7 energy level of the carbon ion, then the ion will emit radiation at discrete energies given by the difference in energy between the \"n\"=7 and \"n\"=6 levels, the \"n\"=6 and \"n\"=5 levels, the \"n\"=5 and \"n\"=4 levels, and so on (down to \"n=1\"). This line emission is Doppler-broadened as a result of ion thermal motion, and Doppler-shifted as a result of ion flow. The Doppler shift causes the emission to be blue-shifted (towards shorter wavelength/higher frequency) if the ions are moving towards the point of observation, or red-shifted (towards longer wavelength/lower frequency) if the flow is away from the point of observation. Measurements of the carbon emission line shape are therefore used to extract values for the impurity ion temperature and velocity.\n\n\"Charge Exchange\": H + C →\n\nH + C (\"n=7\", \"l=6\")\n\n\"Radiative decay\": C (\"n=7\", \"l=6\") →\n\nC (\"n=6\", \"l=5\") + h (photon)\n\nIn a typical fusion device the neutral atom density is small. Therefore, the amount of radiated emission that results from charge exchange between impurity ions and neutrals is also small. On MST, the neutral density is enhanced by injection of fast hydrogen atoms via a diagnostic neutral beam (DNB). As a result, the radiated emission is greatly increased, though primarily along the beam injection path (the DNB is located below the deck, and cannot be seen from here; the injection path is from right to left across the plasma).\nPerpendicular to the beam path, there exist a number of optical ports for viewing the plasma at different radial positions. For a given plasma discharge, a fiber bundle system is placed on one of these ports, and is used to collect emission along its line-of-sight (black tubes on top of the machine contain light collection optics; fibers are placed in the long, curved white tube when not in use). This emission is sent to a spectrometer (located in big purple box), where it is dispersed over a finite wavelength range — which is centered on the emission line of interest — by a pair of optical gratings. However, because the collected emission is dominated by radiation from along the beam path, the measurements are effectively localized to the intersection volume between the fiber view and the beam. On MST, this intersection volume is small (~ 2 cm) compared to the plasma volume, allowing spatially resolved measurements of \"T\" and \"v\" to be obtained. Data collected from a number of plasma discharges — for which the location of the fiber bundle system is varied — are used to construct radial profiles of the impurity ion temperature and velocity, providing important information for understanding the physics of plasmas in MST. Typical ion temperatures measured by CHERS on MST are in the range of 100 to 800 eV (2 million to 17 million degrees Fahrenheit), depending on position in the plasma and type of discharge. Likewise, measured equilibrium ion velocities are on the order of 1,000 to 10,000 meters per second.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2203170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203170", "title": "WCIX", "text": "WCIX\n\nWCIX, virtual channel 49 (VHF digital channel 13), is a MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to Springfield, Illinois, United States and serving the Central Illinois region. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with Champaign-licensed CBS affiliate WCIA (channel 3). The two stations share studios on South Neil Street/US 45 in downtown Champaign and also operate a sales office and news bureau on East Edwards Street near the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield. WCIX's transmitter is located on Etherton Lane in Clear Lake Township. There is no separate website for WCIX; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WCIA.\n\nSince WCIX's over-the-air signal cannot be seen in eastern parts of the market (including Champaign, Urbana, and Danville), it is simulcast in high definition on WCIA's second digital subchannel (UHF channel 34.2 or virtual channel 3.2 via PSIP) from a transmitter west of Seymour along the Champaign–Piatt county line. Nielsen Media Research treats WCIX and WCIA-DT2 as one station in local ratings books, using the identifier name WCIX+.\n\nBefore WCIA signed-on in 1953, it originally wanted to build its transmitter tower in White Heath, halfway between Champaign and Decatur. The tower would have been placed on some of the highest ground in Central Illinois. However, after construction began, then-ABC affiliate WTVP (channel 17, now WAND) filed an objection. Even though it was obvious that Champaign–Urbana and Springfield/Decatur would be considered a single market, WTVP owner Prairie Television claimed WCIA was trying to encroach on its territory. To avoid delays, that station moved its transmitter to its current location in Seymour. While the signal from the Seymour tower covered Decatur very well, it was barely viewable in Springfield until cable television arrived in the market in the early 1960s.\n\nWCIA quickly established itself as the dominant station in the region despite its signal issues in the western half of the market. Eventually, then-owner Midwest Television decided to open a low-powered satellite relay of WCIA on UHF channel 49 to get better coverage in Springfield and the surrounding area. This relay launched in 1967 under the callsign W49AA. On February 4, 1985, Midwest Television upgraded channel 49 to a full-power station under new calls, WCFN. However, like its low-powered predecessor, WCFN was a straight simulcast of WCIA, even airing its commercials. WCFN's existence was only acknowledged in WCIA's legal station identifications.\n\nIn 2002, WCFN broke off from the simulcast to be the market's first full-time UPN affiliate. That network had previously been seen in off-hours on Pax outlet WPXU (channel 23, now WBUI) in Decatur. However, few viewers actually lost access to WCIA, given the extremely high penetration of cable and satellite in central Illinois.\n\nThe removal of CBS service from the station would be temporary with the launch of WCFN's digital transmitter, meaning that despite the conversion to UPN, WCFN's schedule could also air as a WCIA subchannel, with WCIA's main CBS channel able to be carried by WCFN. Accordingly, the main channel 49 schedule was added to WCIA-DT2 with channel 3's schedule airing on WCFN-DT2. WCIA's signal aired in full 1080i high definition, with the main WCFN schedule only seen in a reduced 480i standard definition over-the-air on both channels 49.1 and 3.2 as multiplexing of two high-definition signals was not yet possible. In September 2006, with ACME Communications's WBUI (then with executive connections with a former WB network executive) \"de facto\" taking The CW affiliation by default, WCFN joined MyNetworkTV instead in the wake of the WB/UPN merger.\n\nIn early 2007, Nexstar and the Illinois High School Association came to an agreement to carry coverage of IHSA tournaments in the market on channel 49. Central Illinois had previously been without an over-the-air flagship station for these kind of events. Also, from the 2010–11 NBA season to the 2019 Major League Baseball season, the station carried Chicago Bulls, Cubs, and White Sox games which aired in Chicago on WCIU and WLS-TV and were produced by WGN Sports. The station carried Indianapolis Colts preseason football games starting in 2011. Before 2011, WCFN featured Labor Day coverage of the US Open tennis tournament from CBS because of WCIA's commitment to air the \"Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\". In 2011, the tennis coverage shifted fully to WCIA since the telethon was limited to the night before Labor Day.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, the station's call sign was changed to WCIX—a call sign used on CBS owned-and-operated station WFOR-TV in Miami, Florida from 1967 to 1995, when that station changed from channel 6 to channel 4 and swapped with NBC's WTVJ. At that point, the station's logo was changed to resemble that of sister station KARZ-TV in Little Rock, Arkansas; which is also a MyNetworkTV affiliate associated with a big three network-affiliated station (in that case, NBC outlet KARK-TV).\n\nIn June 2015, Nexstar upgraded the transmitters of WCIA and WCIX to allow high definition multiplexing, so WCIX's main MyNetworkTV channel began to be carried on both stations in full 1080i on both 49.1 and 3.2.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal—which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019—would result in WCIX and WCIA gaining additional sister stations in nearby markets including Chicago (independent station WGN-TV) and St. Louis (Fox affiliate KTVI and CW affiliate KPLR-TV). (Ownership conflicts existed in two existing Nexstar markets involving Nexstar's duopoly of CW affiliate WISH-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WNDY-TV (which were both sold to Circle City Broadcasting) and Tribune's duopoly of Fox affiliate WXIN and CBS affiliate WTTV/WTTK in Indianapolis and Nexstar's virtual triopoly of CBS affiliate WHBF-TV, CW affiliate KGCW and Fox-affiliated SSA partner KLJB and Tribune-owned ABC affiliate WQAD-TV (which was sold to Tegna) in the Quad Cities.) The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nWCIX-DT1 and WCIA-DT2 both broadcast in 1080i, upscaled from MyNetworkTV's default 720p format.\n\nWCIX (as WCFN) shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 49, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to VHF channel 13. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 49.\n\nOn April 7, 2005, WCIA began airing the market's first prime time newscast on WCFN. Known on-air as \"Primetime News at 9\", the broadcast originated from the main studios in Champaign but was targeted specifically at a Springfield-based audience. The name was altered to \"myCFN News at 9\" in September 2006 to reflect WCFN's affiliation change to MyNetworkTV.\n\nThere would not be any competition in the time slot until September 11, 2006 when rival ABC affiliates WICS/WICD began co-producing a nightly prime time newscast at 9 on Fox affiliates WRSP/WCCU. That program was based out of WICS' Springfield studios but, unlike WCFN's show, featured market-wide coverage (including contributions from WICD reporters based in Champaign). However, there was a separate weeknight weather forecast segment seen on WRSP and WCCU that was specifically geared towards the Springfield and Champaign areas, respectively.\n\nAlso in 2006, WCIA began airing an hour-long extension of its weekday morning newscast at 7 a.m. on WCFN. This originally included a simulcast of the 6 o'clock hour of \"The Morning Show\" from WCIA. At the end of the first hour, viewers were always reminded to flip the channel to WCFN which offers a local alternative to the national morning programs seen on the big three networks. In 2007, another hour was added to the show which can now be seen from 7 until 9.\n\nIn 2009, WCIA announced it would cancel \"myCFN News at 9\" and launch a new sixty-minute newscast weeknights at 7 on WCFN beginning September 28. As a result, MyNetworkTV programming now airs out-of-pattern, via an hour tape delay, from 8 to 10 p.m. The broadcast would eventually be reduced to 30 minutes in length. On October 24, 2012, WCIA upgraded local news production to high definition level. However, WCIX's newscasts were initially seen over-the-air in a letterboxed format because its main channel only transmitted in 4:3 standard definition until it was upgraded to full HD in 2015. WRSP/WCCU added competition to the weekday morning news race on January 20, 2014 after WICS began producing a two-hour extension of its morning show on the Fox affiliates. In addition to WCIA's main facilities, it operates bureaus in Springfield (on East Edwards Street near the Illinois State Capitol) and Decatur (on North Water Street).\n\nIn September 2017, the station moved its newscast from 7 to 9 p.m.\n\n"}
{"id": "2203174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203174", "title": "Misinformation", "text": "Misinformation\n\nMisinformation is false or inaccurate information. Examples of misinformation include false rumors, or insults and pranks, while examples of more deliberate disinformation include malicious content such as hoaxes, spearphishing and computational propaganda. Its main effects raise fear and suspicion among the general population. News parody or satire may can become misinformation if it is taken as serious by the unwary and spread as if it were true. The terms \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" have often been associated with the neologism \"fake news\", defined by some scholars as \"fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent\". The main difference between misinformation and disinformation is misinformation is shared accidentally, while disinformation is shared deliberately.\n\nThe history of misinformation, along with that of disinformation and propaganda, is part of the history of mass communication itself. Early examples cited in a 2017 article by Robert Darnton are the insults and smears spread among political rivals in Imperial and Renaissance Italy in the form of \"pasquinades\". These are anonymous and witty verse named for the Pasquino piazza and \"talking statue\" in Rome, and in pre-revolutionary France as \"canards\", or printed broadsides that sometimes included an engraving to help convince readers to take their wild tales seriously.\n\nThe spread in Europe and North America of Johannes Gutenberg's mechanized printing press increased the opportunities to spread English-language misinformation. In 1835, the New York Sun published the first large-scale news hoax, known as the \"Great Moon Hoax\". This was a series of six articles claiming to describe life on the Moon, \"complete with illustrations of humanoid bat-creatures and bearded blue unicorns\". The fast pace and sometimes strife-filled work of mass-producing news broadsheets also led to copies rife with careless factual errors and mistakes, such as the Chicago Tribune's infamous 1948 headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\".\n\nIn the so-called Information Age, social networking sites have become a notable vector for the spread of misinformation, \"fake news\" and propaganda. Misinformation on social media spreads quickly in comparison to traditional media because of the lack of regulation and examination required before posting. These sites provide users with the capability to spread information quickly to other users without requiring the permission of a gatekeeper such as an editor, who might otherwise require confirmation of its truth before allowing its publication. Journalists today are criticized for helping to spread false information on these social platforms, but research such as that from Starbird et al. and Arif et al. shows they also play a role in curbing the spread of misinformation on social media through debunking and denying false rumors.\n\nInformation conveyed as credible but later amended can affect people's memory and reasoning after retraction. Misinformation differs from concepts like rumors because misinformation it is inaccurate information that has previously been disproved. According to Anne Mintz, editor of \"Web of Deception: Misinformation on the Internet\", the best ways to determine whether information is factual is to use common sense. Mintz advises that the reader check whether the information makes sense and whether the founders or reporters of the websites that are spreading the information are biased or have an agenda. Professional journalists and researchers look at other sites (particularly verified sources like news channels) for that information, as it might be reviewed by multiple people and heavily researched, providing more concrete details.\n\nMartin Libicki, author of \"Conquest In Cyberspace: National Security and Information Warfare\", noted that the trick to working with misinformation is the idea that readers must have a balance of what is correct or incorrect. Readers cannot be gullible but also should not be paranoid that all information is incorrect. There is always a chance that even readers who have this balance will believe an error to be true or that they will disregard factual information as incorrect. According to Libicki, readers' prior beliefs or opinions also affect how they interpret new information. When readers believe something to be true before researching it, they are more likely to believe information that supports these prior beliefs or opinions. This phenomenon may lead readers who otherwise are skilled at evaluating credible sources and facts to believe misinformation.\n\nAccording to research, the factors that lead to recognizing misinformation is the amount of education a person has and the information literacy they have. This means if a person has more knowledge in the subject being investigated, or are familiar with the process of how the information is researched and presented, then they are more likely to identify misinformation.\n\nPrior research suggest it can be very difficult to undo the effects of misinformation once individuals believe it to be true and fact checking can even backfire. This is to say that despite the ability to fact check informaiton and debunk its accuracy once an audience has consumed the information and believed it to be true it can be a difficult task to undue this belief. Media literacy, which can be a beneficial solution to interpreting media, teaching users to be skeptical is a practical approach that will not have the possibility of backfiring.\n\nHistorically, people have relied on journalists and other information professionals to relay facts and truths. Many different things cause miscommunication but the underlying factor is information literacy. Information distributed by various means, and because of this, it is often hard for users to ask questions of the credibility of what they are seeing. Many online sources of misinformation use techniques to fool users into thinking their sites are legitimate, and the information they generate is factual. Often, misinformation can be politically motivated. Websites such as USConservativeToday.com have previously posted false information for political and monetary gain. In addition, to the sharing of misinformation for political and monitary gain it is also spread unintentionally.Advances in digital media have made it easier to share infoamtion although it is not always accurate. The next sections discuss the role social media has in distributing misinformion, the lack of internet gatekeepers, inaccurate information from media sources, and competition in news and media.\n\nContemporary social media platforms offer a rich ground for the spread of misinformation.The exact sharing and motivation behind why misinformation spreads through social media so easily remains unknown. Combating its spread is difficult for two reasons: the profusion of information sources, and the generation of \"echo chambers\". The profusion of information sources makes the reader's task of weighing the reliability of information more challenging, heightened by the untrustworthy social signals that go with such information. The inclination of people to follow or support like-minded individuals leads to the formation of echo chambers and filter bubbles. With no differing information to counter the untruths or the general agreement within isolated social clusters, some writers argue the outcome is a dearth, and worse, the absence of a collective reality, some writers argue. Although social media sites have changed their algorithms to prevent the spread of fake news, the problem still exists. Furthermore, research has shown that while people may know what the scientific community has proved as a fact, they may still refuse to accept it as such.\n\nMisinformation thrives in a social media landscape frequently used and spread by college students. This can be supported by scholars such as Ghosh and Scott(2018), who indicated that misinformation is \"becoming unstoppable\". It has also been observed that misinformation and disinformation come back, multiple times on social media sites. A research study watched the process of thirteen rumors appearing on Twitter and noticed that eleven of those same stories resurfaced multiple times, after much time had passed.\n\nAnother reason that misinformation spreads on social media is from the users themselves. In a study, it was shown that the most common reasons that Facebook users were sharing misinformation for social motivated reasons, rather than taking the information seriously. Although users may not be spreading false information for malicious reasons, the misinformation is still being spread across the internet. A research study shows that misinformation that is introduced through a social format influences individuals drastically more than misinformation delivered non-socially.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature and structure of the Internet, writers can easily publish content without being required to subject it to peer review, prove their qualifications, or provide backup documentation. Whereas a book found in a library generally has been reviewed and edited by a second person, Internet sources cannot be assumed to be vetted by anyone other than their authors. They may be produced and posted as soon as the writing is finished. In addition, the presence of trolls and bots used to spread willful misinformation has been a problem for social media platforms. As many as 60 million trolls could be actively spreading misinformation on Facebook.\n\nAn example of bad information from media sources that led to the spread of misinformation occurred in November 2005, when Chris Hansen on \"Dateline NBC\" made a claim that law enforcement officials estimate 50,000 predators are online at any moment. Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from \"Dateline\" expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \"Goldilocks number\". Reporter Carl Bialik says that the number 50,000 is used often in the media to estimate numbers when reporters are unsure of the exact data.\n\nBecause news organizations and websites hotly compete for viewers, there is a need for great efficiency in releasing stories to the public. News media companies broadcast stories 24 hours a day, and break the latest news in hopes of taking audience share from their competitors. News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for fact-checking, or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation.\n\nMisinformation can affect all aspects of life. Allcott, Gentzkow and Yu (2019:6) concur that diffusion of misinformation through social media is a potential threat to democracy and broader society. The effects of misinformation can lead to the accurateness about information and details of the occurrence to decline. When eavesdropping on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation.\n\nIn regards to politics, some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies. This type of misinformation comes from speakers not always being upfront and straightforward. When information is presented as vague, ambiguous, sarcastic, or partial, receivers are forced to piece the information together and make assumptions about what is correct. Aside from political propaganda, misinformation can also be employed in industrial propaganda. Using tools such as advertising, a company can undermine reliable evidence or influence belief through concerted misinformation campaign. For instance, tobacco companies employed misinformation in the second half of the twentieth century to diminish the reliability of studies that demonstrated the link between smoking and lung cancer. In the medical field, misinformation can immediately lead to life endangerment as seen in the case of the public's negative perception towards vaccines or the use of herbs instead of medicines to treat diseases.\n\nWebsites have been created to help people to discern fact from fiction. For example, the site FactCheck.org has a mission to fact check the media, especially politician speeches and stories going viral on the Internet. The site also includes a forum where people can openly ask questions about information they're not sure is true in both the media and the internet. Similar sites give individuals the option to be able to copy and paste misinformation into a search engine and the site will investigate the truthfulness of the inputted data. Famous online resources, such as Facebook and Google, have attempted to add automatic fact checker programs to their sites, and created the option for users to flag information that they think are false on their website. A way that fact checking programs find misinformation involve finding the truth by analyzing the language and syntax of news stories. Another way is that fact checkers can search for existing information on the subject and compare it to the new broadcasts being put online. Other sites such as Wikipedia and Snopes are also widely used resources for verifying information.\n\nSome scholars and activists are pioneering a movement to eliminate the mis/disinformation and information pollution in the digital world. The theory they are developing, \"information environmentalism\", has become a curriculum in some universities and colleges.\n\n\n"}

Formed in the late 1990s, the band released five albums between 2001 and 2008.\n\nOriginally comprising Viv Strachan (vocals), Gordon McIntyre (guitar), Nick Reynolds (bass), and Alexis Beattie (drums), Ballboy played gigs around Edinburgh for a few years, and recorded tracks for the Edinburgh indie compilation \"it's a life sentence...\", released by the newly formed SL Records label in 1997.\n\nBy 1999 Gordon McIntyre, the band's main songwriter, had taken over vocal duties. Katie Griffiths had joined on keyboards, and Gary Morgan had taken over the drums. The band signed to SL Records that year, and released a series of EPs. The tracks from these EPs were collected on 2001's \"Club Anthems.\" The band toured the United States in September / October 2002 and McIntyre's journal of the tour was published in \"The Scotsman\" newspaper.\n\nTheir \"proper\" debut album, \"A Guide for the Daylight Hours\", was released in November 2002, featuring artwork by Glasgow-based artist David Shrigley. This album was followed in 2003 by the acoustic, and often melancholy, \"The Sash My Father Wore and Other Stories\", virtually a solo record by McIntyre.\n\nIn 2004 Ballboy returned to full band mode, with a new keyboard player, Alexa Morrison, and their third album. The band continue to play live occasionally and released their fourth studio album \"I Worked on the Ships\" in August 2008. Gordon McIntyre has begun work on a side project, ++Money Can't Buy Music.\n\nFrom their early releases, the band were popular with the late DJ John Peel, and had several tracks featured in the Festive Fifty charts. They recorded several sessions for his BBC Radio 1 show, including a Christmas special live from Peel Acres, where McIntyre recorded a duet with American country singer Laura Cantrell.\n\nIn Autumn 2008 McIntyre composed the soundtrack for the Traverse Theatre Company production of \"Midsummer [a play with songs]\" by David Greig. \"Midsummer\" performed at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, from 24 October to 15 November 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was designed by Eurocom Entertainment Software and published by Taxan.\n\nAccording to the game's manual, an evil magician named Abadon was able to use his power to summon groups of evil beasts, and then built a castle for himself. He then sent out his followers to rid the peace-loving land of Merlwood of its most powerful wizards, a task that was accomplished with ease. While this was going on, a young man named Paul, an apprentice magician who lives in the land of Serenna, is preparing to go on a quest to travel across the land to learn all of the secrets from the ancient masters. However, he hears of the purging of wizards by Abadon, and instead sets out as the last wizard alive to defeat Abadon.\n\nThe game is officially labeled as a role-playing game, but it lacks almost every one of the characteristics of the genre: no freedom of backtracking, no optional side-quests, no weapons nor armor, not even attributes that rule probability of success in combat or spellcasting, no explicit experience levels, and the actual levels (\"rating\" in the game) have no effect on any attribute except the spell points maximum.\n\nThe player must navigate him through puzzles and mazes in order to acquire more items, which allow Paul to learn more spells, and weapons, which allow him to cast certain spells or shield himself.

Paul sets out with some food, water, and money. The game uses a unique system for learning and using magic spells: the player transcribes spells by piecing together sets of phonemes to form magic words, and each spell has a corresponding word that must be written to learn it. Players can simply write the spell words for every single spell at the start of the game (although writing a spell costs 50 mana each).\n\nBy helping other characters and completing various tasks, Paul grows more experienced, increasing his maximum mana and his rank as a magician.\n\nThe game uses a battery-backed save system, which allows the player to save their progress at any time. However, it only allows the player to save a maximum of 15 times, with four different save slots to use.\n\nIn December 2012 programmer Chris Shrigley released the source code for educational purposes to the public.\n\n"}
{"id": "2203201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203201", "title": "Out of Nothing", "text": "Out of Nothing\n\nOut of Nothing is the fourth studio album by English rock band Embrace. It was released on 13 September 2004 through Independiente Records. It went straight in at number one on the official UK charts, going double platinum, selling more than 600,000 copies in the UK, making it their best selling album and their most critically acclaimed since their debut album \"The Good Will Out\". It was a much-anticipated release, as Embrace had not released any new material for three years.\n\nAfter the release of Embrace's third album, 2001's \"If You've Never Been\", which debuted at number 9 on the UK charts and dropped off completely after three weeks, the band were dropped by their record label, Hut, in 2002. Though they were almost immediately picked up thereafter by Independiente, whose founder and managing director, Andy MacDonald, was a long-time fan of the band, Embrace admittedly had a lot of writing and recording to do before they would have enough quality material for a fourth album.\n\nFor two years, Embrace wrote and recorded songs on tape, resulting in an immense amount of possible album material, 500 \"songs and half-songs\" compiled on 52 C90 tapes. In December 2003, after four listening sessions spread over two years, MacDonald finally gave the go-ahead to the band to begin recording for their next album. Later that month, Embrace played three secret gigs as \"The Good Good People\" at Leeds' Cockpit to \"road test\" the new material in preparation for recording.\n\nThe band brought in Youth to produce, having had good experiences with his production on singles All You Good Good People and Come Back to What You Know from their first album, \"The Good Will Out\". Most of the band were excited about the effect that bringing new leadership into the studio was having on their music, but Danny McNamara, the band's lead singer, had a tough time adjusting to Youth's production style: \"January, February and March this year were the hardest time of my life. I was getting four hours sleep a night. Every morning I'd get up and have to take a pill just to stay calm that day. The amount of arguments and throwing shit...It was really intense.\" Youth changed McNamara's song structures, his lyrics, and pushed him to sing with more emotion. Said McNamara: \"There were times I hated him. I'd ring our manager and have meetings with the label, where I'd say, 'Look, can you tell him who's boss? 'Cause he's not listening to me.'\" Thankfully, the label kept its position that Youth was in charge, because gradually, things started to click between the band and its producer. McNamara eventually changed his tune, saying, \"I think I've grown as a person...the idea of relinquishing control and just having a bit of belief and faith in someone else is new to me in my thirty-three years. And it's paid off. I've left my ego at the door.\" Several songs began to take shape and sound that had previously eluded the band.\n\nOut of the 500 possibilities, the band eventually narrowed the list of potential album cuts down to fifteen songs, and then finally decided on the best ten. These included \"Ashes,\" which started life in 2001 as a piano-driven ballad and eventually took the form of a four-minute long anthem of a pop song, \"Someday,\" whose verse was written in 1997 and waited seven years for the rest of the song to show up, and \"Everytime I See Your Face,\" a song that would never see the light of public release. This was due to the addition of \"Gravity,\" a Coldplay-penned composition that Chris Martin (good friend of Danny McNamara) gifted to Embrace after Martin decided that the song sounded a bit more like Embrace than it did Coldplay. \"Everytime I See Your Face\" was dropped from the album, and \"Gravity\" not only found itself on \"Out of Nothing\" but also in the role of comeback single, being Independiente's preferred choice over \"Ashes,\" which had been the album's intended first single before the introduction of \"Gravity.\" Danny McNamara referred to this decision as the \"sexy angle.\"\n\nThe last two songs on the album, \"Near Life\" and the title track, were Embrace's first attempts at songwriting as a band. The success the band experienced in this process led to their next album, \"This New Day\", being almost entirely composed of full-band compositions.\n\n"}

He is best known for his tenure with World Championship Wrestling, where he wrestled under the ring names Ice Train and M.I. Smooth.\n\nOn the July 7, 1993 edition of \"WorldWide\", Hogue made his World Championship Wrestling debut under the ring name Ice Train by winning a handicap match. He later made his pay-per-view debut at the first-ever Fall Brawl event, where he defeated Shanghai Pierce. Hogue then teamed up with The Shockmaster and Charlie Norris and defeated Harlem Heat and The Equalizer at Halloween Havoc. However, Hogue's undefeated streak was broken after losing to Ron Simmons at \"Clash of the Champions\" on January 27, 1994.\n\nHogue wrestled for the Catch Wrestling Association from 1994 to 1995, and again in 1996.\n\nAfter being absent from WCW for the rest of 1994 and all of 1995, Hogue returned to WCW on the February 14, 1996 edition of \"Saturday Night\" in a match against Scott Norton. The match ended in a double countout when both men clotheslined each other, knocking themselves out in the process. After the match, the two shook hands and Norton declared to announcer Gene Okerlund that he and Ice Train would become a formidable tag team because of their similar in-ring styles. The team was quickly named Fire and Ice with Norton representing \"Fire\" and Ice Train eponymously representing \"Ice\". The team easily overpowered numerous teams as they tried to establish themselves as a legitimate contender for the World Tag Team Championship. At Slamboree: Lord of the Ring, Ice Train and Norton were \"randomly selected\" to be on the same team and they easily defeated the makeshift team of \"Big\" Bubba Rogers and Stevie Ray in the first round of the Lethal Lottery tournament. After winning their match, both Ice Train and Norton advanced to the final round and competed in an eight-man battle royal, but neither was successful as Diamond Dallas Page eliminated both men and went on to win the Lethal Lottery tournament, earning a title shot in the process.\n\nSoon afterward, Fire and Ice began feuding with Norton's longtime rivals, The Steiner Brothers. After wrestling to a double countout on two separate occasions, the two teams faced off at the Great American Bash on June 16 to determine who would become the number one contenders to the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Scott Steiner pinned Norton after a Frankensteiner to earn the win for his team as well as the number one contendership. After the loss, Fire and Ice continued feuding with the Steiners, with the two powerhouse teams trying to prove who was best. After a sudden loss to The Rock 'n' Roll Express on an episode of \"Main Event\" before Bash at the Beach, dissension started to appear between Fire and Ice as Norton attacked Ice Train after another team loss. The team finally imploded when Norton faced and defeated Ice Train at Hog Wild on August 10 in a submission match after Norton made Ice Train submit to an armbar. However, Ice Train defeated Norton in a submission rematch on September 15 at Fall Brawl, when Norton submitted to a full nelson.\n\nAfter the implosion of Fire and Ice, Ice Train returned to singles competition in a loss to Diamond Dallas Page on the November 4, 1996 edition of \"Nitro\" and lost a rematch to Page on the following week's edition of \"Nitro\". Ice Train then competed at World War 3, eliminating Mark Starr and Villano IV and even made it into the final ten, but he was eliminated from the match due to the combined efforts of Kevin Nash and Diamond Dallas Page. After World War 3, Ice Train returned to the undercard and gained Theodore Long as his manager for a very brief period. Ice Train began easily defeating opponents on \"Nitro\" and he soon became a mainstay on \"Pro\". However, he soon continued his undercard role on \"WorldWide\" as well as on \"Thunder\".\n\nHogue returned to the Catch Wrestling Association in 1997.\n\nIn mid-2000, Hogue was again pushed into the spotlight as he became a member of The New Blood faction, who feuded with the Millionaire's Club. Hogue was renamed M.I. Smooth and served as Commissioner Ernest Miller's personal limo driver. Smooth regularly appeared in segments with various members of the New Blood. In early 2001, Smooth began a minor feud with Kanyon by brawling with him. On the March 19, 2001 edition of \"Nitro\", Kanyon defeated Smooth. However, Smooth gained revenge two days later on \"Thunder\" as he teamed up with Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller to defeat Kanyon and Road Warrior Animal. Five days later, WCW broadcast its final edition of \"Nitro\" due to the company being bought out by the World Wrestling Federation, although Hogue would not be affected as he retired from wrestling soon after the merger.\n\nHogue helped train Toney Freeman for his career in bodybuilding.\n\n\n"}

She is known as the periodical foster-mother of Queen Christina of Sweden.\n\nCatherine was the daughter of King Charles IX of Sweden and his first spouse Maria of the Palatinate-Simmern. Her personality was described as \"a happy union of her father's power and wisdom and her mother's tender humility\". Her mother died in 1589, and she was placed in the care of the German Euphrosina Heldina von Dieffenau, whom she praised much later in life. In 1592, her father remarried to Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. She reportedly got along well with her stepmother and was close to her half siblings, especially her eldest brother, the future King Gustavus Adolphus, who is noted to have been very affectionate toward her. In later letters to her consort, however, it seems that she was not always as much in agreement with her stepmother as she gave the impression to be. Her father became regent in 1598, and was crowned king in 1607.\n\nIn 1611, her brother succeeded her father as King Gustavus Adolphus. Her brother found her sensible and wise, and she is reported to have acted as his confidante and adviser on several occasions. Catherine married late for a Princess of her period. Although she was a great heiress, her status on the international royal marriage market was uncertain because of the political situation in Sweden after her father had conquered the throne from his nephew Sigismund. Her parents marriage had been an alliance with the anti-Habsburg party in Germany, which in turn was allied with King Henry IV of France and the French Huguenots, and in 1599–1600, there were plans to arrange a marriage between her and the Protestant French Prince Henri, Duke of Rohan, leader of the French Huguenots. Henry married Marguerite de Béthune in 1603. After the Treaty of Knäred in 1613, her status became more secure. With the support of her stepmother Queen Dowager Christina, the queen dowager's brother Archbishop John Frederik of Bremen arranged the marriage between Catherine and her relative (Count Palatine) John Casimir of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Though relatively poor, he had contacts which were deemed valuable to Sweden, though Count Axel Oxenstierna opposed the marriage.\n\nThe marriage took place on 11 June 1615 in Stockholm. Catherine was, by the will of both her parents as well as by the law regarding the dowry of Swedish Princesses, one of the wealthiest heirs in Sweden. As the economic situation at the time was strained, she remained in Sweden the first years after her marriage to guard her interests. In January 1618, she left for Germany. There, the couple was given the Kleeburg Castle in Northern Alsace as their residence. The year after, John Casimir started to build a new residence, the Renaissance Palace Katharinenburg near Kleeburg. In 1620, the Thirty Years' War forced them to flee to Strassburg.\n\nIn 1622, her brother King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden asked her to return to Sweden with her family. The death of her younger brother in Sweden, as well as the lack of heirs to the Swedish throne was evidently the reason why the monarch wished to move her to safety away from the Thirty Years' War. Catherine accepted the invitation and arrived to Sweden with her family in June 1622. At her arrival, the birth of her son Charles immediately strengthened her position. In Sweden, she and her consort were granted Stegeborg Castle and a county in Östergötland as their fief and residence and as payment of her dowry: Catherine was styled Countess of Stegeborg. Catherine and John Casimir settled in well at Stegeborg, where they maintained a royal standard of living: they kept a court with sixty formal ladies-in-waiting and courtiers and an official table. Catherine actively engaged herself in the management of the estates, and was in 1626 given Skenas royal estate as her personal fief. Catherine was on very good terms with her brother King Gustavus Adolphus, who is known to have asked her for advice. During his trips, he often asked her to try to console and control his consort, Queen Maria Eleonora. Catherine was exposed to certain intrigues at court with the purpose of blackening her name in the eyes of the royal couple, but she managed to avoid these plots. She was on good terms with the dynasties of Pfalz and Brandenburg, with whom she corresponded, and who considered her to be wise and to have good judgement.\n\nIn 1631, Catherine was given the custody of her niece, Princess Christina, the heir to the throne, when the queen was allowed to join the king in Germany, where he participated in the Thirty Years' War. Christina remained in her care until Maria Eleonora returned to Sweden upon the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632. After the death of King Gustavus Adolphus, the couple came in conflict with the Guardian Government of Queen Christina over their position and rights to Stegeborg. When John Casimir broke with the royal council in 1633, the couple retired from court to Stegeborg. Catherine did not show any interest in participation in state affairs. In 1636, however, Queen Dowager Maria Eleonora was deemed an unsuitable guardian and deprived of the custody of the young monarch, and Catherine was appointed official guardian and foster mother with the responsibility of the young queen's upbringing. The appointment was made upon the recommendation of Count Axel Oxenstierna, and she reportedly accepted the task with reluctance. This appointment destroyed her relationship with Maria Eleonora. The years in Catherine's care are described by Christina as happy ones.\n\nPrincess Catherine personally enjoyed great respect and popularity in Sweden as a member of the royal house and as the foster parent of the monarch: however, this respect did not include her consort, who was given no task or position at court whatsoever. John Casimir was himself careful to point out her rank as a Royal Princess, but he was himself exposed to some humiliation because of their difference in rank. One example was at the opening of Parliament in 1633, when Catherine in accordance with the wish of the Royal Council followed Queen Christina in the procession, while John Casimir was given the choice to stand and watch the ceremony from a window or not be present at all.\n\nCatherine died in Västerås, where the royal court had fled from an outbreak of plague in Stockholm. At her death, Axel Oxenstierna said, that he would rather have buried his own mother twice, than once again see \"the premature death of this noble Princess\". After her death, the royal council appointed two foster mothers for the queen to replace her: countess Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag.\n\nThe Katarina kyrka in Stockholm is named after her.\n\nOn 11 June 1615, she married count palatine John Casimir of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Five of their children survived infancy:\n\n\nAll kings of Sweden following her son, except three (Frederick I, Oscar I and Charles XIV John), have descended from her. Frederick I and Oscar I were married to her descendants, Charles XIV John was the adopted son of her descendant Charles XIII.\n\n Catherine of Sweden's ancestors in three generations\n"}

It was founded in August 1910 by Eleftherios Venizelos and went on to dominate Greek politics for a considerable number of years until its decline following the Second World War. Among its most well-known members, apart from Venizelos, were Alexandros Papanastasiou, Nikolaos Plastiras, Georgios Papandreou and Konstantinos Mitsotakis.\n\nSince its founding, the party's emblem had been the anchor, Venizelos had brought with him from Crete.\n\nFounded as the \"Xipoliton\" (\"barefoot\") party in Crete (then an autonomous region of the Ottoman Empire), its early leaders were Kostis Mitsotakis (grandfather of Konstantinos Mitsotakis) and Eleftherios Venizelos. After the annexation of Crete by Greece, Venizelos moved to Athens and turned the party into a national one, under the \"Fileleftheron\" (liberal) name in 1910. For the following 25 years, the fate of the party would be tied to that of Venizelos. The party was legally disbanded after the failed coup attempt led by Nikolaos Plastiras of 1935, although the organization remained active.\n\nDuring World War II, a Greek government in exile was formed in Cairo, Egypt, with the assistance of the British. The government was formed almost entirely of prominent Liberals, including Georgios Papandreou and Sophoklis Venizelos, even as King George remained the official head of state.\n\nThe party was reformed after the war. By the 1950s, the Liberal Party had lost much of its support and it was eventually merged into the Centre Union, which went on to win the 1963 and 1964 elections. Throughout its existence, the Liberal Party sought to hinder the rise of the Communist Party of Greece which was the only real opposition to the Liberals on their most important electoral basis (the refugees of the New Lands, i.e., lands acquired by Greece following the Balkan Wars and World War I), sometimes with the use of anti-communist legislation.\n\nThe Liberal Party merged into Center Union (\"Enosi Kentrou\") in 1961, under the leadership of Georgios Papandreou.\n\nIn 1980, Eleftherios Venizelos' grandson Nikitas founded a new party under the same name that claims to be the continuation of the original party, see Liberal Party (Greece, modern).\n\nRepresenting the centrist elements of Greek society, and supported by the middle class and the populations of the New Lands, its main competitor was the People's Party. Increasingly the Liberal Party became associated with anti-monarchism and during the 1920s the Liberals established a republic which they led for most of its short-lived existence.\n\n\n\n"}

Approximately from Stoupa is the village of Agios Nikolaos (also known by its Slavic name \"Selinitsa\"), a working fishing village which also has a number of restaurants and guest houses but which attracts fewer tourists than Stoupa. Above Agios Nikolaos is the lovely small village called Riglia. Other places in the Mani region include Itylo (), Limeni () and Areopoli (). Below Areopoli are the caves of Pirgos Dirou.\n\nThere are many beaches and coves around the area including Stoupa Beach, which is the most popular and has a good beginner's snorkeling site at the end of the beach. Over the hill is Kalogria Beach, with its turquoise waters and rich marine life, volleyball net, and a handful of bars and restaurants. One of the features of Kalogria beach is the upswelling of an underground freshwater spring about out from the shore. It can be seen as a disturbance on the surface of the sea.\n\nIn the past, the Mani area was known for its fierce inhabitants, who lived in isolated fortified towers (some of which are still present today, either in ruins or having been restored). The towers offered protection in an area where feuding was commonplace.\n\nStoupa also has rich cultural history. It is where the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis travelled to with George Zorbas who Kazantzakis employed as the foreman of his lignite mine, the entrance to which can still be seen in a hillside nearby. It is their time together in Stoupa that the novel \"Zorba the Greek\" is based upon, written after hearing news of Zorba's death. There is a bust of Nikos Kazantzakis on the cliff overlooking Kalogria beach, at the corner of the main road and the beach approach. Stoupa is just 7 km away from the historic area of Kardamyli, which is mentioned in work by Homer.\n\nThere are approximately four buses a day which call through Stoupa, running from Kalamata to the southern tip of the peninsula. The bus stops by the bakery, on the main road at the top of Stoupa and takes around ten minutes to reach Agios Nikolaos.\n\nVisitors can book coach trips to the ancient ruins of Olympia and the Corinth Canal. Another possibility is car rental, which allows travellers to take in the sights of places such as Nafplio, Mycenae, Epidavros, and Monemvasia on the Peloponnese.\n\nThe area is serviced by Kalamata Airport where charter flights to the rest of Europe are operated in the summer season, as well as scheduled summer flights to Germany, Sweden, Norway, France, Ukraine and Russia operated by Aegean Airlines.\n\n"}

The group extensively feuded with Lawler into the 1980s, a time particularly remembered for comedian Andy Kaufman's rivalry with Lawler.\n\n\n\nIn 1985, When Hart got hired by WWF, he began becoming a manager of wrestlers including Greg Valentine and King Kong Bundy. he briefly co-managed The Dream Team (Beefcake and Valentine) until he was phased out and gave full control to Johnny Valiant. In September 1985, Hart traded Bundy to manager Bobby Heenan in exchange for Adrian Adonis and The Missing Link.\n\nMany years later, after the demise of the Dungeon of Doom in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1997, Hart resurrected the First Family concept the following year, bringing together several mid-card performers. This short-lived group featured entirely different wrestlers than the Memphis version of the '70s and included former Dungeon members.\n\nThey frequently appeared on WCW programs including \"Monday Nitro\" and primarily feuded with Fit Finlay. Hugh Morrus and Brian Knobs often tagged together, defeating members of Revolution at 1999's Fall Brawl and making a losing effort in a 3-way Tag Team Championship contest at Halloween Havoc.\n\nWith an instrumental version of \"The Zoo\" as their entrance theme, the stable featured a variety of colorful wrestling personalities with unique ring styles: Jerry Flynn demonstrated martial arts strikes and submissions while Brian Knobs utilized a rougher brawling style. Considering publicity photos were taken of the group, WCW's First Family was likely intended for a substantial run; however, according to Hart, the group quickly disbanded due to injuries sustained by numerous members as well as new bookers hired by WCW. In the aftermath of The First Family, Knobs and Hart pursued WCW's hardcore scene that was on the rise in late 1999.\n\n\nContinental Wrestling Association\n"}

Stengel is the founder of Stengel Engineering, also known as Ingenieurbüro Stengel GmbH (or Ingenieurbuero Stengel GmbH).\n\nStengel first worked on amusement park rides in collaboration with Anton Schwarzkopf in 1963. He established his own company, Stengel Engineering, in 1965. His collaboration with Schwarzkopf was responsible for many innovations in roller coaster design, including in 1976 the first modern \"vertical\" looping coaster, \"Revolution\", at Six Flags Magic Mountain. (Arrow Dynamics had debuted the first modern \"corkscrew\" loop a year earlier at Knott's Berry Farm). His clothoid loop is now standard on many roller coasters, as it produces less intense forces on the human body than a circular vertical loop. In 1976 Stengel and Schwarzkopf established the first horizontal launch \"Shuttle Loop\". He is notable for being a pioneer in heartlining, the principle of having the track twist and rotate around the rider's heart line, rather than the track rotating around its own center.\nSince Schwarzkopf's retirement, Stengel has worked on most of the world's record-breaking roller coasters, including Son of Beast, Millennium Force, Superman The Ride, Top Thrill Dragster, Kingda Ka, Dollywood's Mystery Mine, El Toro, Maverick and Olympia Looping, the world's largest portable roller coaster, among many others. Seventy-two percent of the attractions on the 2004 Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards list of the world's top fifty steel roller coasters were designed by Stengel Engineering.\n\nStengel received an honorary doctorate from Gothenburg University in 2005 for \"inexhaustible creativity in linking physics and design to the experience of the body in roller coasters and other rides,\" among the most highly regarded of which is Lisebergbanan at Liseberg park in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nIn 2002, he designed the \"Stengel Dive,\" the roller coaster element that bears his name, for Goliath at Walibi Holland, Netherlands.\n\nStengel celebrated his 500th roller coaster with the opening of Maverick, located at Cedar Point. \n\nHe is semi-retired and serves as a consultant to the amusement park ride industry.\n\n"}

Long known as a center of refined maiolica manufacture, Deruta remains known for its ceramics, which are exported worldwide.\n\nProbably built upon Roman foundations, Deruta's name in its early variants (Ruto, Ruta, Rupta, Direpta and Diruta) all signify the “ruin” of this strategic site caused by the 6th-century Gothic War and the Lombard invasion. The Medieval commune that rose from these ruins had its own charter in the 13th century and was governed from its own Palazzo of the Consuls, but in fact Deruta has been under the dominion of neighboring Perugia since the 11th century, and has largely participated in Perugia's vicissitudes. The town's fortifications date from the 12th century, when it was an outpost in Perugia's marches, facing the rival town of Todi. In 1465, under a new agreement with Perugia, the magistrate sent from Perugia would govern with the consent of four local men of good character (\"quattro boni omini\"). The ravages of plague were so fierce at Deruta that rewalling in the later 15th century took in a smaller circuit to accommodate the reduced population. Besieged in 1408 during the confusion of the Papal Schism by the condottiere Braccio da Montone, and later heavily damaged by Cesare Borgia, Deruta was plundered by Braccio Baglioni, the master of Perugia. Thus in 1540, when the Papal forces of Pope Paul III ousted the Baglioni family from Perugia in the brief war over salt taxes locally called the \"Salt War\" (\"Guerra del Sale\"), Deruta sided with the papacy against Perugia, an alliance that gained it a reduction in taxes. With the papal reduction of Perugia, the region settled down to uneventful history as part of the Papal States.\n\nThe local clay was good for ceramics, whose production began in the Early Middle Ages, but found its artistic peak in the 15th and early 16th century, with highly characteristic local styles, such as the \"Bella Donna\" plates with conventional portraits of beauties, whose names appear on fluttering banderoles with flattering inscriptions. The lack of fuel enforced low firing temperatures, but from the beginning of the 16th century, Deruta compensated with its metallic lustre glazes in golds and ruby red. In the 16th century Deruta produced the so-called \"Rafaellesque\" ware, decorated with fine arabesques and \"grottesche\" on a fine white ground.\n\nDeruta, with Gubbio and Urbino, continues to produce some of the finest Italian maiolica.\n\n\nDeruta was the birthplace of Girolamo Diruta, an organist, music theorist, and composer.\n\n"}

In 1853, a Brazilian owned paddle steamer made it all the way to Nauta.\n\nNauta is the primary destination of the only major road leading out of Iquitos, and is a staging area for several ecotourism lodges and ships on the Marañòn River. Boats take passengers from Nauta to the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve.\n\nNauta is home to many unique features of nature. One example is the Sapi Sapi lagoon, where many exotic animals are found, such as the Yellow-spotted river turtle, the pirarucu fish, crocodiles, and the Arrau turtle. For those interested in seeing these animals up close, the option to take a boat around the lagoon is available. According to legend, there was once a mysterious mermaid that attracted locals with her clothing and natural beauty.\n\nAnother attraction is the \"Playa del Amor\", located on the outskirts of Nauta and surrounded by jungle. Another highlight is the \"Quebrada Gasparito\", another natural area that can be accessed by canoe and is known to be a relaxing getaway spot.\n\nAt the center of town is another attraction, the \"Plaza de Armas\" (see Plaza de Armas) and is characterized by the diversity of mythical statues made up by local residents that represent the native culture of the area. The \"Iglesia de Nauta\", which is now used as a local parish theater, can also be found in the plaza, along with a school and bronze bust both named after Manuel Pacaya. A few streets past the plaza is the local marketplace where local customers and merchants from all over come to exchange goods.\n\nNauta is also the access point to the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve. In order to enter the reserve, a permit must be purchased from the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA). Interested parties may enter by river through the community of \"20 de febrero\". Visitors will find that the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve is one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet.\n\nIn 2013, residents of Nauta created a children's rap video in the Kukama-Kukamiria dialect, in collaboration with Radio Ucamara.

Later his family relocated to Des Moines, Iowa. He played guitar but switched to bass after he relocated to Iowa. In his youth, Gray performed in bands such as Anal Blast, Vexx, Body Pit, The Have Nots and Inveigh Catharsis.\n\nIn June 2003, Gray crashed his car into another vehicle. After police were called to the scene and searched his car, Gray was arrested for possession of marijuana, cocaine and drug paraphernalia, as well as failure to obey a traffic signal.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was one of three original members of Slipknot remaining in the band, and the only one who had maintained his original role in the band due to Clown's switch from main drums to percussion during the early days. He was one of the two members not born in Iowa (the other is Jim Root, who was born in Las Vegas).

In a 911-call, obtained by TMZ, one of the hotel's proprietors said that a hypodermic needle was found next to Gray's bed, as well as many pills that were apparently scattered across the room. An initial autopsy determined that no foul play or trauma was involved, but could not establish the cause of death. He is survived by his wife Brenna and their daughter October, who was born after his death.\n\nOn June 21, 2010, autopsy results were released that stated Gray had died of an overdose of morphine, and had also shown signs of \"significant heart disease\". Also found in the autopsy were traces of anti-anxiety pill Xanax, which Gray had a history of abusing.\n\nOn the day after Gray's death, May 25, 2010, the band, without their usual masks, held a formal press conference in Des Moines, Iowa. They did not take any questions from the media. The band, as well as Gray's brother, Tony, and wife, Brenna, paid tribute to him.\n\nA private funeral was held on May 28, 2010. Paul Gray was buried at the Highland Memory Gardens Cemetery in Des Moines, Iowa. On November 8, 2010, items that decorated Gray's grave, including a Buddha statue and gargoyle statue, were stolen.

He was accused of continually writing high-dose prescription narcotics to Gray from December 27, 2005 until his death, despite knowing Gray's history of drug addiction and abuse. The doctor appeared in court on September 27, 2012 to face the charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. On May 1, 2014, jurors found Daniel Baldi not guilty on all seven counts of involuntary manslaughter following two days of deliberation. Gray's wife Brenna had testified during the two-week-long trial that Baldi prescribed the anti-anxiety drug Xanax to her husband, despite knowing he was addicted to the prescription medicine.\n\nIn January 2018 the family received an out of court settlement from a civil lawsuit they had filed against Dr. Daniel Baldi and his former employers.

The highway runs generally north–south, with Somerset, near Burnie, as its northern terminus and Zeehan as its southern terminus. The highway was opened on 13 December 1963. Part of the highway from to Burnie was known as the Waratah Highway until 1973.\n\nThe highway is susceptible to ice and snow in winter. One of the notorious sections is at the edge of Mount Black, numerous accidents have occurred in the area. Also the Zeehan to Rosebery section has hazardous sections which can be affected by cold and wet weather.\n\nPortions of the highway have been made redundant by extra roads built by Hydro Tasmania during their work on the upper Pieman River scheme and the Henty River dam schemes. These provide short cuts from Queenstown straight through to Tullah by going just west of the West Coast Range.\n\nThe highway crosses the Mackintosh River and the Murchison River near the town of Tullah, where the rivers form a confluence to form the Pieman River.\n\nPrior to its construction, most transportation from the west coast to the north coast was required to use the Emu Bay Railway, or otherwise use shipping to Regatta Point or Strahan in Macquarie Harbour.\n\n\n"}

The newspaper was founded in 1996 as a sports-only newspaper called \"The Title\", but was soon expanded into a general broadsheet Sunday newspaper with its founder, former County Meath Gaelic football player Liam Hayes, carrying on as editor. The paper was considered a 'middle-market' publication.\n\n\"The Title\" was founded in 1996 by journalists Liam Hayes and Cathal Dervan. Hayes, a former captain of the Meath Gaelic football team who made five All-Ireland final appearances, had worked with Dervan at the \"Meath Chronicle\" before spending seven years at the \"Sunday Press\", a national newspaper which folded in 1995. \"The Title\" focused exclusively on sports, covering events from local to international in scale. The newspaper attracted a niche audience, garnering a circulation of 29,000.\n\nOn 21 September 1997, the publication was relaunched as \"Ireland on Sunday\", a three-section, full-colour broadsheet newspaper incorporating \"The Title\" as its tabloid-format sports section. The venture was backed by a consortium of Irish and Irish-American investors, headed by the property developer Paschal Taggart. The consortium invested a total of £4m, with £1.5m being spent on aggressive marketing in the first year. The paper sought to capture some of the former readers of the \"Sunday Press\", which had a circulation of 150,000 before its demise. Hayes said before launch that \"Ireland on Sunday\" aimed to \"reflect the thoughts, the values and the desires of a 32-county Ireland\".\n\nThe newspaper met with success and the first issue's run of 120,000 sold out. Circulation settling at 66,863 by March 1998, well above its launch-day estimate of 40,000 within two years. However, financial difficulties forced Hayes to remortgage his house and ask the company's directors for €50,800 each to keep the title afloat. In July 2000, \"Ireland on Sunday\" was sold to Scottish Radio Holdings for approximately €10.16 million, with Hayes remaining in place as editor. However, in December of that year, he resigned from his post, to be replaced by former \"Evening Herald\" editor Paul Drury.\n\nIn July 2001 it was announced that Associated Newspapers, the national newspaper arm of the Daily Mail and General Trust, had bought \"Ireland on Sunday\" from Scottish Radio Holdings for £7.4 million. The circulation of the newspaper from January to June 2001 was 53,051. The \"Daily Mail\" publisher embarked on a campaign to reposition the middle-market title, slashing its cover price to 50c and bringing its design in line with the British \"Mail on Sunday\". Its editor during this period, former \"Scotsman\" editor Martin Clarke, was accused of anglicising the formerly Irish nationalist title.\n\nOn 21 September 2006, DMGT announced that the previous weekend's edition of \"Ireland on Sunday\" had been the last under that masthead, completing its transition to becoming the \"Irish Mail on Sunday\". The newspaper was already informally considered to be the Irish edition of the \"Mail on Sunday\" and used a variation of that newspaper's masthead and editorial style, but DMGT's move made that transition complete. The UK edition of the \"Mail on Sunday\" was withdrawn from the Irish market in line with this.\n\n\"IoS\" (as it was nicknamed) was aimed at the traditional Irish nationalist readers who had read \"The Sunday Press\", leading it to adopt an Irish nationalist slant. It sold more copies in Northern Ireland (11,000-12,000) per week than any other Dublin-based weekly newspaper. Founding editor Liam Hayes said that its tone was intended to be \"humorous, provocative and responsible\". The paper's columnists included nationalist historian Tim Pat Coogan and publisher of the New York-based \"Irish Voice\" Niall O'Dowd. It attracted controversy on several occasions, clashing with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern over invasion of privacy and supporting swimmer Michelle Smith long after other newspapers had turned against her over allegations of doping.\n"}

Christopher Amott left the band shortly after recording the album in July 2005 but rejoined 2 years later for the songwriting sessions for \"Rise of the Tyrant\".\n\n\"Doomsday Machine\" received mixed reviews by critics. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters praised the songs highlighting \"Enter the Machine\", \"Nemesis\" and \"My Apocalypse\". He said that Michael and Christopher Amott \"truly shine on the album\" and that Arch Enemy \"marry the brutal with the melodic\" with \"impressive skill\".

It is a slightly better album than \"Wages of Sin\" and much better than \"Anthems of Rebellion\"\" and called \"My Apocalypse\" of \"perfect example of a band that has found the right consistency in its line-up.\" However, he criticized the fade out of \"Slaves of Yesterday\". Evil Rocker of Metal Rules noted that \"perhaps the most impressive aspect of this album is the heavy use of dual guitars and solo's [sic], not something usually in the forefront of this genre.\" Jackie Smit of \"Chronicles of Chaos\" felt that the album presents significant improvements over the previous album \"Anthems of Rebellion\" and commented that it \"as a whole is likely to disappoint only the most selective listener.\" Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic said that \"Doomsday Machine\" is \"fundamentally, yet another immaculately produced Arch Enemy album, forged first and foremost by the vision of Michael Amott's guitar.\" Ciaran Meeks of \"Metal Eater\" commented that the band \"have harked back to their roots on this album, reworking and revitalizing the musical philosophy of albums such as \"Stigmata\" and \"Burning Bridges\" into a new-millennial context that will doubtless bludgeon both old and new listeners alike into drop-jawed submission.\" \n\nJason Jordan of Metal Review wrote a negative review where he states that the band \"haven't crafted anything purchase-worthy since Johan Liiva was fronting the crew.\" Jordan also comments that \"while \"Doomsday Machine\" isn't utterly devoid of arresting ingredients, you probably won't glean as much satisfaction from this as you will from \"Black Earth\" or \"Burning Bridges\".\" MetalGeorge of Metal Rules also criticized the album saying that it \"severs all ties between the band and [its] old fan base by catering even more to the plague that is the New Wave of American Heavy Metal\" and that \"where as albums such as \"Burning Bridges\" and \"Wages of Sin\" lead the heavy metal charge, \"Doomsday Machine\" seems content to merely follow in the trodden footsteps of today's trends and common sounds.\" Greg Pratt of \"Exclaim!\" wrote that the album is \"basically more of the same but they've managed to revitalise their sound a bit, adding in some toe-tapping maturity, along with the usual balls-out shredding.\" Cosmo Lee of \"Stylus Magazine\" concluded that \"minus that instrumental, and with more focused songwriting, this album could have been killer. Instead, it is a collection of riffs strung together, with some hot guitar playing.\" Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net said that \"overall, the album leaves a pretty good impression, though it seems to be lacking a certain spark that made earlier efforts essential listening.\" Not unlike him, Justin Donnelly of \"Blistering\" felt that the album \"lies somewhere in between both damnation and acclaim, without being one of the other.\" He commented that the record is not terrible, but \"an inconsistent and unfocussed effort\" and that \"Doomsday Machine\" \"overall is stronger than \"Anthems of Rebellion\", but it is hardly a huge leap forward in terms of consistency.\" The song \"I Am Legend/Out For Blood\" is featured in the comedy movie Let's Be Cops.\n\n\"Doomsday Machine\" received one nomination at the 2005 Metal Storm Awards in the category of The Best Melodeath/Gothenburg Album. It was ranked in the second position behind \"Character\" by Dark Tranquillity.\n\nIn 2005, the album was ranked number 470 in \"Rock Hard\" magazine's book of \"The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time\".\n\n\nPersonnel credits adapted from \"Doomsday Machine\" album liner notes.\n\n\n\n"}

She is considered a pioneer in her use of the romantic novel to explore social and racial themes.\n\nHopkins was born to Benjamin Northup and Sarah Allen in Portland, Maine and grew up in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father was influential in Providence, Rhode Island, due to his political ties and her mother was a native of Exeter, New Hampshire. Though he was not her biological father, Pauline regarded William Hopkins to be her father, hence her surname.\n\nHopkins’ mother, Sarah Allen, was married for a short time to Benjamin Northup and it is from said union that she was born. Allegations of infidelity led to Allen filing for divorce and shortly afterward she met and married.\n\nThe high achieving Hopkins household encouraged Pauline academically, which led her to develop an appreciation for literature. In 1874, after completing her second year at Girls High School, she entered an essay contest held by the Congregational Publishing Society of Boston and funded by former slave, novelist, and dramatist William Wells Brown. Her submission, “Evils of Intemperance and Their Remedy,” highlighted the problems with intemperance and urged parents to be in control of their children's social upbringing. She placed first in the contest, won $10 in gold, and was honored by the judges for her excellent writing skills.\n\nBefore she was noted as a legendary journalist, she rose to fame by catching the public's attention through her various roles as a dramatist, actress and singer. In March 1877, she participated in her first dramatic performance which was \"\"Pauline Western, the Belle of Saratoga.\"\" She acted in several plays after this one, which all received great reviews. However, it was not until the beginning of the 1900s, she decided to focus more on her literary passions.\n\nHer first known work, a musical play called \"Slaves’ Escape; or, The Underground Railroad\" (later revised as \"Peculiar Sam; or, The Underground Railroad\"), first performed in 1880. Her short story \"Talma Gordon\", published in 1900, is often named as the first African-American mystery story. She explored the difficulties faced by African-Americans amid the racist violence of post-Civil War America in her first novel, \"\", published in 1900. She published three serial novels between 1901 and 1903 in the African-American periodical \"Colored American Magazine\": \"Hagar's Daughter: A Story of Southern Caste Prejudice\", \"Winona: A Tale of Negro Life in the South and Southwest\", and \"Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self\". She sometimes used the pseudonym Sarah A. Allen. Pauline Hopkins was beginning to make a reputation for herself. As a result of this, she was offered the opportunity to become a member of the board of directors, a shareholder and a creditor of the \"Colored American Magazine\". Along with her amazing writing, she helped to increase subscriptions and raise funding for the magazine. These roles alone helped her break into the literary world, with her work making up a substantial amount of the literary and historical materials promoted by the magazine.\n\nAfter her involvement with the \"Colored American Magazine\", Hopkins published four additional stories and serialized three novels, \"Hagar's Daughter: A Story of Caste Prejudice\", \"Winona: A Tale of Negro Life in the South and Southwest\", and \"Of One Blood;\" or \"The Hidden Self\", in the \"Colored American Magazine\". Her work has been regarded among other notable African-American writers at the time such as Charles Chesnutt, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Sutton Griggs by Richard Yarborough. In relation to women's publications, Yarborough calls her \"the single most productive black woman writer at the turn of the century.\"\n\n\"Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self\" is the last of four novels written by Pauline Hopkins. She is considered by some to be the most prolific African-American woman writer and the most influential literary editor of the first decade of the 20th century, though she is lesser known than many literary figures of the Harlem Renaissance. \"Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self\" first appeared in serial form in \"The Colored American Magazine\" in the November and December 1902 and the January 1903 issues of the publication, during the four-year period in which Hopkins served as its editor. Elements of the work have been compared to Goethe's \"Faust\".\n\n\"Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self\" tells the story of Reuel Briggs, a medical student who does not care about being black or appreciating African history but finds himself in Ethiopia on an archaeological trip. His motive is to raid the country of lost treasures, which he does find. However, he discovers much more than he expected: the painful truth about blood, race, and the half of his history that was never told. Hopkins wrote the novel intending, in her own words, to \"raise the stigma of degradation from [the Black] race.\" The title, \"Of One Blood\", refers to the biological kinship of all human beings.\n\nIn 1988, Oxford University Press released The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers with Professor Henry Louis Gates as the general editor of the series. Hopkins' novel \"Contending Forces: A Romance Illustrative of Negro Life North and South\" (with an introduction by Richard Yarborough) was reprinted as a part of this series. Her magazine novels (with an introduction by Hazel Carby) were also reprinted as a part of this series. Carby did this as a way to reintroduce Hopkins into the sphere and see how her literature influenced writers in the past, present and now future.\n\nDespite the climate of racism and other social injustices going on during this time, Hopkins made her voice, especially the black voice, known throughout history. She was fearful of the consequences of her actions, but also knew it was necessary for the world to know the struggles of being black in the United States in the 1900s. Other scholars, including Hopkins, have accredited her boldness in her writing on behalf of her parents and the example they set for her. \"The Northup legacy that Pauline Hopkins would claim as her own was one of impressive public action, fearless civic ambition and strong community consciousness.\"\n\nHopkins spent the remainder of her years working as a stenographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from burns sustained in a house fire.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The character is best known as the mailman of the Fantastic Four in their self-titled comic book.\n\nThe character was originally created for a syndicated daily comic strip by writer Stan Lee and artist Dan DeCarlo. Lee recalled in a 1998 interview that,\n\n\"Willie Lumpkin\" drew humor from the people and situations Willie would encounter along his mail delivery route in the small town of Glenville. The daily strip ran from December 1959 to May 6, 1961. A Sunday strip ran through May 28.\n\nLee and artist Jack Kirby then introduced their comic book version of Willie Lumpkin in \"Fantastic Four\" #11 (Feb. 1963). The comic book Lumpkin is depicted as significantly older than in the comic strip, though the character's good nature was retained, as were references to his past as a mailman in Glenville, which the comic book placed in Nebraska.\n\nIn his first comic book appearance, Lumpkin is represented as having befriended the Fantastic Four, to whom he makes regular fan mail deliveries at their Baxter Building headquarters in New York City. He half-jokingly requests to join the team on the grounds that he has the \"power\" to wiggle his ears.\n\nLumpkin appeared in his own solo feature in \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #18 (May 1989). In this parody of \"A Christmas Carol\", he is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who had intended to haunt cantankerous Spider-Man nemesis J. Jonah Jameson but couldn't find his address. The story concludes with the normally amiable postman deciding he hates Christmas.\n\nIn Marvel Comics, Willie Lumpkin serves as the postal worker mailman whose Manhattan route includes the joint home and office of the superhero group the Fantastic Four. On occasion he falls into the danger that typically surrounds the adventuring heroes. Examples include a story in which he is forced to spend Christmas Eve locked in a closet while the Fantastic Four fight the Super-Skrull, or when he helped to save the team from the Mad Thinker. This incident involved Reed's trust in Lumpkin; he had hired the mailman to manipulate the machinery as part of a safety routine. Later Lumpkin is mind-controlled into accessing Doctor Doom's time machine by a minion of Immortus. An alien Skrull also impersonates him in another story to infiltrate the Fantastic Four's headquarters.\n\nHe also briefly dated Peter Parker's Aunt May. When May briefly appeared to have died, Lumpkin grieved and was seen to befriend a new companion named Doreen Greenwald.\n\nLumpkin has since retired, and his niece Wilhemina \"Billie\" Lumpkin has taken his position as the Fantastic Four's mail carrier.\n\nHe was interviewed about the Fantastic Four on the news show \"Lateline\", saying how though the group took on cosmic menaces, they always found time to greet him. Sometime later, the super-team, miniaturized, entered his body to remove an otherwise inoperable brain tumor.\n\nLumpkin was later hired as a biology teacher for the 'Future Foundation', a school founded by the Fantastic Four. Willie enjoyed a trip to the moon when the Future Foundation and associates decided to hold a party.\n\n\"Marvels\" is a \"history\" of the world of Marvel super-heroes painted by Alex Ross and which spans from the late 1930s to the 1960s. In one scene, main character Phil Sheldon, a journalist who observes the Marvel characters from a distance (and sometimes close-up), meets his ex-girlfriend in a movie theatre where she introduces him to her date, Bill Lumpkin. With a smile, Lumpkin tells Sheldon that they have met though he states that Sheldon will not remember where, causing the reporter a little embarrassment.\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel Universe, there is a government agent named Lumpkin, who works for the agency that runs the think-tank/school in the Baxter Building. His first name is not mentioned. He is in his forties and overweight. He is initially shown recruiting Reed Richards. He has expressed a romantic interest in Grimm's mother. Lumpkin and three of his men assist the Four in confronting the Mad Thinker, a former Baxter Building student. The entire group is knocked out by tranquilizing chemicals. Reed saves everyone.\n\n\n\n"}

The line was originally constructed as a private railway line named the Emu Bay Railway and was one of the longest-lasting and most successful private railway companies in Australia. While at present the line travels from Burnie to Melba Flats, it previously ran through to Zeehan carrying minerals and passengers as an essential service for the West Coast community.\n\nIn the 1870s, the Van Diemen's Land Company engaged John C. Climie to undertake a survey of a line from near Burnie to Mount Bischoff. On 1 February 1878 a , horse drawn wooden tramway opened from Emu Bay (Burnie) to Rouse’s Camp, near Waratah to serve the Mount Bischoff tin mines. In 1887, the line was taken over by the Emu Bay to Mount Bischoff Railway Company and relaid with steel rails as gauge railway line to allow steam locomotives to operate. In 1897 the Emu Bay Railway Company took over the line, extending it 60 kilometres to Zeehan on 21 December 1900.\n\nFollowing the opening of the Murchison Highway, the line was closed between Rosebery and Zeehan in August 1965. After being sold in 1967 to EZ Industries, the line was upgraded to carry heavier trains and in January 1970 reopened from Rosebery to Melba Flats. During the construction of the Pieman River hydro electric scheme in the late 1970s the line was diverted in places and new bridges were built.\n\nThe Melba Line was included in the October 1984 sale of EZ Industries to North Broken Hill Peko, which in 1988 merged with CRA Limited to form Pasminco. In 1989 an 11 kilometre branch opened from Moorey Junction to serve Aberfoyle’s Hellyer Mine. On 22 May 1998, the line was sold by Pasminco to the Australian Transport Network and integrated into its Tasrail business. In February 2004 it was included in the sale of Tasrail to Pacific National and in September 2009 to the government owned TasRail.\n\nAt its peak as a steam operation the railway had approximately 23 stopping or named places (including names for watering locations and other passenger operation related points) on its line and adjacent lines:\n\n\nBeyond Zeehan the Tasmanian Government Railways line continued to Regatta Point to connect with the Mount Lyell line to Queenstown.\n\n\n\n"}

They were sent out into the San Gabriel Valley towns to organize new troops and recruit leaders. By March 1919, there were nine active troops with 190 boys in the SGV. The Pasadena Council (also known as the Pasadena District Council) of the Boy Scouts of America was organized March 3, 1919, with jurisdiction over Pasadena, Altadena and Lamanda Park.\n\nA charter was granted by the BSA National Headquarters dated April 1, 1919 to the Pasadena District Council. Tallman Trask was hired to be the first Scout Executive. Trask had been a District Executive for the Los Angeles Council. He had also served as Los Angeles' camp director. Prior to joining the BSA, Trask was an executive for the YMCA and had run several camps for them. By October 1, 1919, there were 15 active troops with 299 Scouts.\n\nThe council's name was changed in 1929 to Pasadena-San Gabriel Valley Council to better reflect the geographic area served by the council. In 1951 the name was changed to San Gabriel Valley Council to shorten it and better identify the 29 cities and towns that made it up.\n\n\n\nHolcomb Valley Scout Ranch, was a BSA camp and is now closed, at elevation, was located north of Big Bear Lake in the old mining district of Belleville in the Holcomb Valley on the site of the old Hitchcock Ranch. Holcomb Valley Scout Ranch is North of the town of Fawnskin. The camp offered a week-long Oak Badge-National Youth Leadership Training class and offered a Boy Scout summer resident camp until 2012 when the program was ended. The camp was closed a few years later. One Hike offered is to the Big Bear Discovery Center. Cougar Crest hike to Bertha Peak gives an amazing view of Big Bear Lake. Spring creek trail offers a more level long hike. South of the camp, not far away is the Pacific Crest Trail. To the East and near the camp is a USFS public camp ground \"Holcomb Valley Camp Ground\".\n\nHolcomb Valley Scout Ranch was formerly part of Old Baldy Council. The Scout Ranch was turned over to the San Gabriel Valley Council in 2005. The Old Baldy Council took title to the property in 1965 from William Hitchcock. The Hitchcock Ranch is still part of the Holcomb Valley Scout Ranch. Guy Reide, Old Baldy's Scout Executive(1949 to 1966) in 1965 had the vision and worked with William Hitchcock to have the ranch turned into a Scout camp. Loren Baldwin became the first camp ranger and Holcomb Valley held its first Boy Scout summer resident camp in 1974. Holcomb Valley is named after William F. Holcomb, who discovered gold there and staked a claim in May 1860 with his partner. Holcomb became known for his marksmanship. After 10 years of prospecting he still had no major success. As food sources were diminishing, some of the prospectors hired Holcomb to hunt for grizzly bear to provide food for the long winter months. While trailing a bear up Polique Canyon he found Holcomb Valley. Tracking the injured animal, he passed a quartz ledge shining with gold.\nBonanza and many other western films and TV shows were shot in Holcomb Valley. For a short time under Old Baldy Council the camp was called \"Camp Lipscomb\" after US Congressman Glenard P. Lipscomb.\n\nTrask Scout Reservation is in the City of Monrovia, Ca. in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. It is located above the sawpit dam off of Monrovia Canyon Park. Camp Trask offers, Cub Scout Programs, Family Camp programs and Boy Scout Programs on a year-round basis. The camp has a full size fort used for many program activities, called Fort Rotary. The camp is in a riparian zone ecosystem. Canyon stream and the camp are shaded by deciduous trees, white alders and bigleaf maples, evergreen canyon and coast live oaks.\n\nOriginally known as Monrovia Scout Reservation, Camp Trask was purchased in 1966. The camp was dedicated as Tallman H. Trask Scout Reservation on May 13, 1972.\n\nCamp Cherry Valley is a summer camp on the leeward side of Catalina Island, California, which is owned and operated by the Greater Los Angeles Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. It is located two coves north of Two Harbors at Cherry Cove. The camp, valley and cove get their name from the Catalina cherry trees native to the island. It also offers non-Scouting programs on a year-round basis.\n\nThe San Gabriel Valley Council's Order of the Arrow lodge is the Ta Tanka Lodge (#373). In 2016 the Ta Tanka Lodge merged with the Siwinis OA Lodge to form the new lodge: Tuku'ut and the totem is the Saber-Toothed Cat. Ta Tanka Lodge started with 120 members who chose the Sioux word \"ta tanka\" meaning \"bull buffalo\" as its name and as their totem a white buffalo. The Order of the Arrow (OA) is the national honor society of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The OA's Ta Tanka Lodge as three goals: recognize outstanding Scouts, promote BSA camping and provide cheerful service to the SGVC, including its Districts, Packs and Troops . Since 1933 the Ta Tanka Lodge has hosted a weekend camp out the weekend after Thanksgiving call \"Desert Caravan\", held in the various campgrounds in the Mojave Desert. \"Caravan\" was move to Labor Day weekend camp at Camp Holcomb Valley. Caravan is open to Troops and families of the SGVC with events like treasure hunt, Branding Irons, team games-fun competitive events, dutch oven cobbler cook-off, chili cook-off and a campfire program.\n\nTa Tanka Lodge has four local Chapters:\nOn March 16, 2016 the Ta Tanka OA Lodge of the San Gabriel Valley Council and the Siwinis OA Lodge of the Los Angeles Area Council voted and agreed on a new Lodge name and totem for the new Lodge of the Greater Los Angeles Area Council. The new Lodge is Tuku'ut and the totem is the Saber-Toothed Cat. The Order of the Arrow (OA) is the national honor society of the Boy Scouts of America. The OA provides leadership and service experience to OA Scouts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2203381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203381", "title": "The Fabulous Rougeaus", "text": "The Fabulous Rougeaus\n\nThe Fabulous Rougeaus (also known as The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers) was the professional wrestling tag team of real-life brothers Jacques and Raymond Rougeau, best known from their time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from 1986 to 1990.\n\nJacques and Raymond began tag-teaming in the late 1970s in their family's Montreal-based wrestling promotion. They later became major stars in Lutte Internationale. Their most notable feud in Montreal was against the Garvin brothers, Ron Garvin and Jimmy Garvin (who were not actually brothers); the climax of their feud was a match in front of close to 20,000 fans at the Montreal Forum.\n\nThey were signed to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) contracts in February 1986, and debuted as clean-cut faces, The Rougeau Brothers. The Rougeaus were often matched against heel teams such as The Dream Team and Demolition. The latter team coined the nickname the \"Ragú sisters\" for the brothers - this would later be revived after the Rougeaus' eventual heel turn by such face opponents as The Rockers, The Bushwhackers and Demolition who had made their own (face) turn.\n\nThe Rougeaus actually won the WWF Tag Team Championship on August 10, 1987 at the Forum, in a House Show, defeating The Hart Foundation. Jimmy Hart, the Hart Foundation's manager, tried to interfere on their behalf with his signature foreign object, a megaphone. The megaphone was intercepted by the Rougeaus, who used it to get the pin and win the titles. They were announced as the new tag team champions, but the decision was later reversed and their title win was never recognized by the WWF.\n\nNearly a year after this event, the Rougeaus made a gradual turn to heel. An early indication of this came during a televised match against The Killer Bees, which aired during July 1988. Both teams went into the match as babyfaces, but the Rougeaus won the match by cheating. After the match, fans booed when the Rougeaus offered to shake hands with the Bees, who refused. Also during this period of time, old rivals the Hart Foundation had turned babyface and dumped \"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart as their manager. Jimmy became manager of the Rougeaus to solidify their heel turn and to solidify The Hart Foundation's babyface turn. This was also done in part because the Rougeau Brothers were not getting over with fans, and Vince McMahon felt they might be more successful as heels.\n\nThe Rougeaus began calling themselves The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers and feuded with the Hart Foundation during the fall of 1988 into early 1989, with the storyline being that Jimmy Hart still had a contract with the Hart Foundation, and was subsequently giving his percentage of the Foundation's earnings to the Rougeaus as a bonus. The Rougeaus developed a facetiously pro-American gimmick, billing themselves as \"soon to relocate to Memphis, Tennessee\" and using the theme song \"All-American Boys\". The theme song was an upbeat rock number, sung by the Rougeaus themselves, would further rile the fans by claiming their affinity for \"whitebread\" things like \"preppy\" hairstyles and Barry Manilow's music. The bridge of the song (in French) admits they are aware the fans despise them, slyly confirming that their ingratiating demeanor is phony and done to mock the fans. To draw even more heat, they would wave comically small American flags and try to start a \"U.S.A.\" chant just to annoy the crowd.\n\nThe Rougeaus had a real-life altercation with Tom Billington (the Dynamite Kid from The British Bulldogs) backstage in 1988. \"Mr. Perfect\" Curt Hennig had framed the Bulldogs in a prank at the Rougeaus' expense, leading to the Dynamite Kid (upset about being incorrectly blamed) slapping Jacques from behind in the locker room in Miami and repeatedly punching him in the face. Tension between Dynamite and the Rougeaus mounted for more than a week until Jacques punched him in the mouth with a roll of quarters in hand before the next TV tapings in Fort Wayne, Ind., causing Dynamite to lose four teeth. After the attack, Billington harbored a grudge against the Rougeaus, and it was feared Dynamite might try to get revenge after their 10-team, 20-man elimination match at the Survivor Series 1988 PPV (which was his final match in the WWF). The match had the Rougeaus, Demolition, Brain Busters, The Bolsheviks, and Los Conquistadores vs. The British Bulldogs, The Rockers, The Hart Foundation, The Young Stallions, and The Powers of Pain. For fear of the Dynamite Kid taking his revenge, the match was booked so the Rougeaus were the first team eliminated, with Bret Hart pinning Raymond in the bout's opening minutes with a small package. The Bulldogs were kept in the match until they were one of the final four teams remaining. By the time the Bulldogs had been eliminated and made their way back to the locker room, the Rougeaus had already been rushed out of the building. During the actual match, Dynamite worked with the Rougeaus without incident.\n\nThe Rougeaus' next big feud was against The Rockers in 1989. The feud began when the Rockers debuted a new theme song for themselves with them singing (this new theme was soon dropped, however). The Rougeaus claimed that the Rockers were \"copycats,\" and hit Shawn Michaels in the throat with Jimmy Hart's megaphone. The teams feuded over the summer of 1989, producing many excellent, raved-about matches. At SummerSlam 89, the Rougeaus teamed with fellow Canadian Rick Martel, defeating the Rockers and Martel's former Strike Force tag-team partner Tito Santana in a six-man tag team match. After their initial feuds against the face teams of the era, the Rougeaus quickly devolved into a comedy tag team, often coming out on the short end against The Bushwhackers.\n\nRaymond, who suffered from chronic back pain for years, retired in 1990 and moved behind the microphone; briefly as an interviewer for English-language WWF broadcasts, then as host of their French-language TV shows. He came out of retirement in 1996 to face Owen Hart in a boxing match at the Forum and now occasionally wrestles in Jacques' Montréal-area promotion, Lutte International 2000.\n\nJacques disappeared from the WWF for nearly a year, but was re-branded as The Mountie upon his return in 1991, and went on to singles success with Jimmy Hart as his manager. The Mountie was a corrupt member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) who would often boast that he \"always gets his man\" in the ring. Rougeau's greatest singles success as The Mountie was when he won the WWF Intercontinental from Bret Hart in January 1992. He would only hold the title for two days however, losing it to Rowdy Roddy Piper at the Royal Rumble.\n\nThe Mountie gimmick caused some controversy in Canada with the real RCMP, with litigation forcing Rougeau to use his real life name when wrestling in his home country, though he did continue to wrestle in his Mountie inspired boots, black pants and red shirt. Despite being a heel in the WWF, Rougeau, like a lot of other Canadian wrestlers, was cheered in Canada, especially in his home province of Quebec. At one time during his singles run, Rougeau wrestled a match with WWF Champion Hulk Hogan where the babyface Hogan (who was the WWF's most popular star at the time) was actually booed by the crowd and Rougeau was the fan favorite, despite he and Jimmy Hart doing what they could to get heat from the crowd in attendance.\n\nHe then began teaming up with Carl Ouellet to win the World Tag Team Championship three times as The Quebecers. He briefly retired, reunited with Ouellet as \"The Amazing French Canadians\" in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and appeared sporadically in the WWF and WCW before retiring from full-time competition. He occasionally wrestles for his own promotion.\n\nOn March 30, 1998 they reunited with Pierre as they defeated a young Edge, Shawn Stasiak and Tom Brandi in a 6-tag in a dark match for WWF Shotgun Saturday Night.\n\n\n"}

One of their best-known songs, it reached No. 7 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the week of March 7, 1987, and was later named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The song was also included on their compilation albums \"\" in 1999 and \"Solid Gold Hits\" in 2005.\n\nThe song, written by Adam Yauch and band friend Tom \"Tommy Triphammer\" Cushman (who appears in the video), was intended as an ironic parody of \"party\" and \"attitude\"-themed songs, such as \"Smokin' in the Boys Room\" and \"I Wanna Rock\". However, the irony was lost on most listeners. Mike D commented that, \"The only thing that upsets me is that we might have reinforced certain values of some people in our audience when our own values were actually totally different. There were tons of guys singing along to 'Fight for Your Right' who were oblivious to the fact it was a total goof on them.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Fight for Your Right\" begins as a mother and father tell their two sons to stay out of trouble while they are away. When they leave, the two boys decide to have a party, hoping \"no bad people show up\"; this prompts the arrival of Ad-Rock, Mike D, and MCA at the party. The trio start all kinds of trouble within the house, such as chasing and kissing girls, starting fires, bringing more troublesome people into the house, spiking the punch, smashing things, and starting a massive pie fight. As the pie fight reaches its peak, Ad-Rock, Mike D, and MCA run away, the party having become too out of hand even for them. As the video ends, the remaining partygoers shout along to the final chorus of \"party!\" before hitting the returning mother in the face with a pie.\n\nDirected by Ric Menello and Adam Dubin, there are numerous cameos in this video, including an unknown-at-the-time Tabitha Soren, Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, Def Jam label mate LL Cool J, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, members of the punk rock band Murphy's Law, as well as the Beastie Boys' producer, Rick Rubin, who was shown wearing an AC/DC and Slayer shirt, the latter of whom were also signed to Def Jam at the time.\n\nSoren, whose hair was dyed blonde for the shoot, got her chance to be in the video because she was a friend of Rubin's and attended nearby New York University. \"I worked hard at not getting any pie goo on me,\" she recalls, because the whipped cream used had been scoured from supermarket trash cans since there was no money in the budget for it. As a result, it was rancid and had a foul odor. \"The smell in that room, when everyone was done throwing pies, was like rotten eggs. You wanted to throw up.\"\n\nIn 2011, Adam Yauch directed and wrote a surreal comedic short film entitled \"Fight for Your Right Revisited\" to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original video's release. The short film serves as a video for the single \"Make Some Noise\" from \"Hot Sauce Committee Part Two\". Most of the non-sequitur dialogue between characters were a result of improvisation by the cast.\n\n\"Revisited\" acts as a sequel to the events that took place in the original music video and features Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA (played by Seth Rogen, Elijah Wood, and Danny McBride, respectively) as they get into more drunken antics, before being challenged to a dance battle by the future Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA (John C. Reilly, Will Ferrell, and Jack Black, respectively), coming out of a DeLorean.\n\nThe short features numerous cameo appearances, some appearing onscreen for only a few seconds. They include Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandon, Steve Buscemi, Alicia Silverstone, Laura Dern, Shannyn Sossamon, Kirsten Dunst, Ted Danson, Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman, Rainn Wilson, Amy Poehler, Mary Steenburgen, Will Arnett, Adam Scott, Chloë Sevigny, Maya Rudolph, David Cross, Orlando Bloom, and Martin Starr, as well as the Beastie Boys themselves.\n\nAlthough \"Fight for Your Right\" is not performed, its outro can be heard at the beginning of the short.\n\nSinger/songwriter Cara Quici sampled the song and added new lyrics for her 2013 song \"Fight\" personally approved by Rick Rubin and licensed by Sony ATV and Universal Music Group. The \"Fight\" video by Cara Quici features a cameo by Dennis Rodman.\n\nIn 1998, the song was covered by N.Y.C.C. whose version peaked at 14 in the UK singles chart.\n\nOn August 2, 2009, Coldplay performed an acoustic piano-based version of this song during their concert on the final night of the All Points West concert series as a tribute to the Beastie Boys, who were unable to perform on opening night following Adam Yauch's announcement that he had cancer. The band performed this version again on May 4, 2012, at their concert at the Hollywood Bowl as a tribute to Yauch, who had died earlier that day.\n\n"}

Foster on June 18, 1873, the paper was named after the U.S. Democratic Party, which then was the conservative and less-popular party in New England. Foster was already known, by then, as a political firebrand; one of his previous publishing ventures had been the \"States and Union\", a pro-slavery paper in nearby Portsmouth, New Hampshire, during the American Civil War.\n\n\"Foster's Daily Democrat\" still takes a conservative line in its editorial pages, and its editorials tends to back Republicans. \"Foster's\" endorsed George W. Bush in the 2000 New Hampshire primary, although the paper backed no one in the general election. It also endorsed District 1 Congressman Jeb Bradley on a number of occasions and it is considered rare for a Democratic candidate to get an endorsement from \"Foster's\". Foster's is in favor of the death penalty.\n\nIn the 2004 New Hampshire Democratic primary, the paper endorsed Joe Lieberman, generally considered a more conservative Democrat. Yet its editorial stated that readers should be \"absolutely clear on one thing. \"Foster's Daily Democrat\" remains fully supportive of President Bush.\"\n\nIn 1988, editor Rodney G. Doherty described himself as a \"black sheep\" of journalism and said he edits \"a blue-collar paper.\" He said he prefers a hard-news, top-down style of newsroom management, with young reporters filing several quick stories based on assignments from editors, rather than longer, more analytical pieces. He said likes to see reporters write about \"what \"is\" news, rather than what they think is the news.\"\n\nColin Manning, who wrote \"Foster's\" statehouse notebook, later went on to be New Hampshire governor John Lynch's communications director.\n\nAs of 2009, Doherty is the executive editor of the paper. The managing editor is Mary Pat Rowland. The assistant managing editor is Mike Gillis. The editorial page editor is Jon Breen.\n\n\"Foster's Daily Democrat\" was an afternoon publication for 135 years until November 26, 2007, when it switched to morning publication. At the time, Doherty said morning publication would be more convenient for readers, and would allow the paper to update its Website earlier in the day.\n\nIn 2014, the Geo. J.

Regular features include advice columns, stock tables, classified advertising, comic strips, obituaries, television listings and local lottery numbers. The newspaper also carries entertainment, world and national news from the Associated Press, as well as both AP and locally generated sports stories.\n\nSections and pullouts for the daily paper include main news and an award-winning sports section every day, plus:\n\n\"Foster's\" competed head-to-head with \"The Portsmouth Herald\", a daily newspaper based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

It is the sequel to the 1985 film \"Fright Night\", with Ragsdale and McDowall reprising their roles. Composer Brad Fiedel also returned with another distinct synthesizer score. Following the plot of the first film, it focuses on Charley Brewster who, now a college student, encounters a group of vampires led by a beautiful woman who is seeking him out.\n\nReleased by TriStar Pictures in 1989, the film grossed almost $3 million domestically, and has since become a cult film like its predecessor. In 2003, it received a brief issuing on DVD by Artisan Entertainment in a full frame presentation, but the release quickly went out of print and has since become a rare collector's item.\n\nA third film was planned with a target release year of 1990, but studio discussions over the popularity of the franchise led to the film being cancelled.\n\nThree years after the first film, 20-year-old Charley Brewster, as a result of psychiatric therapy, now believes that Jerry Dandrige was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire. As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed.\nCollege student Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young, go to visit Peter Vincent, who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on \"Fright Night\", much to the chagrin of Charley. While visiting Peter's apartment Charley sees three large crates being offloaded from a truck. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes drawn to one of the four, the alluring Regine. Charley drives Alex back to her dorm and begins to make out with her, only to see himself kissing Regine and pull away. An upset Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's vampires, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's group, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth, a bug-eating servant of Regine, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs.\n\nLater that night, Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day, Charley talks to his psychiatrist, Dr. Harrison, who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there, however, he sees his friend Richie with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood. Charley runs off to find Peter, and the two of them arm themselves with crosses and crash Regine's party.\n\nThere, Charley finds Richie, but is shocked to find him alive and well, with no bite marks on his neck. Regine makes her entrance, doing an erotic dance with a mesmerized Charley. She introduces herself to Peter and Charley, and claims to be a performance artist in town for some shows. Satisfied that what he thought was Regine attacking Richie was nothing but an act, Charley leaves when he remembers his date with Alex. Peter elects to stay behind and while looking around, he notes that there are people in the corners of the room biting others on the neck. Noting the odd behavior, he draws his pocket mirror and finds that Regine and Belle, who are dancing in the middle of the dance floor, cast no reflections.\n\nStorming out of the party, Peter runs into Regine waiting for him outside. As he runs down the stairwell Peter again comes face-to-face with Regine, who reveals herself as a vampire, the sister of Jerry Dandrige, and has come to take her revenge on both Charley and Peter. Peter runs back home and hides, resolving to tell Charley in the morning what has just transpired. Charley, meanwhile, after being turned away from the symphony, returns home and falls asleep, only to be visited by Regine, who bites him on the neck while he sleeps. Charley, content with the explanation that Regine is a performance artist, is once again in denial. He begins to discuss the situation with Alex when Peter arrives to try to warn the couple about Regine but neither believe him. Peter states that he has warned them and runs back to his home, packs his belongings and departs.\n\nMeanwhile, Charley has started to show signs of being a vampire as he is becoming sensitive to garlic and sunlight. After failing to talk to his psychiatrist, he overhears a news report about Richie's body being discovered the previous night. Now believing that everything is real, Charley goes to see Peter, only to find that Peter has gone. Louie is once again stalking Alex. Louie reveals his true nature to Alex and Charley and stalks them in the school library, only to flee after Alex injures him by cramming wild roses, which are harmful to vampires, into his mouth. Alex and Charley are then arrested by campus officers.\n\nPeter, meanwhile, is also arrested by the cops after he shows up on the set of \"Fright Night\" and attempting to kill its new host, Regine, on live TV. Everyone thinks he's lost his sanity as he says, \"I have to kill the vampire\"; and ends up in a state hospital. Alex is bailed out by Dr. Harrison and goes to post bail for Charley, only to find that he has already been bailed out by Regine. Alex and Dr. Harrison head to the state hospital when the doctor reveals that he is in fact a vampire. He tries to bite Alex only for her to turn the tables on him and run him through with a piece of wood. She then assumes his identity as a doctor and tries to have Peter released from the hospital. A distraction intentionally caused by one of the hospital's patients, Fritzy (who actually believes Peter's story about him being a vampire hunter) allows them to escape the place.\n\nAlex and Peter head to Regine's lair in order to save Charley. They find a disoriented Charley, who is slowly turning into a vampire. They rescue him and manage to kill a now undead Richie, Belle, Bozworth and Louie before confronting Regine. She attempts to escape into her coffin, but finds that Charley and Alex have lined it with Communion wafers. Regine knocks Alex unconscious and attempts to turn Charley into a vampire, but Peter destroys her with sunlight.\n\nSome time later, Charley and Alex discuss the previous day's events, with Alex joking that no one would ever believe them. They ponder if there are more vampires out there, but agree to continue on with their lives while being prepared, just in case. They embrace each other as a bat can be heard flying away.\n\nUnlike the first film, the sequel saw a very limited release in the US by distributor New Century/Vista and producer The Vista Organization. TriStar Pictures, the sister studio of Columbia Pictures, the studio that released the original film, released the film overseas. The film was only released on 148 screens and brought in only $548,231 on its opening weekend. Its domestic gross was $2,983,784.\n\n\"Fright Night Part 2\" received negative reviews, currently holding a 33% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews.\n\nInternational Video Entertainment (IVE, now known today as Lions Gate Home Entertainment) released the film on videocassette in 1989. In Australia, CBS/Fox Video released it to videocassette as a coffin-shaped VHS cover. The film was released on DVD by Artisan Entertainment on August 19, 2003, though the DVD soon went out of print. The transfer on the DVD was criticized for being of a low quality, apparently lifted from a VHS print of the film, and the DVD case also falsely claimed the film was presented in its \"original\" 1.33:1 pan-and-scan transfer, despite the fact that the film was shot on Panavision. A high definition transfer in the original aspect ratio was created for television airings. This transfer has been used to create widescreen, bootleg DVDs and Blu-rays of the film, due to the unavailability and low quality of the official DVD.\n\nRoddy McDowall relished playing Peter Vincent and was eager to bring original creator and director Tom Holland back to the franchise, so he had set up a meeting for himself and Holland with Carolco Pictures chairman José Menéndez. However, before that meeting could occur, Menéndez and his wife were murdered by their sons, Lyle and Erik. Not only did this stop another sequel, it also interfered with the release of \"Fright Night Part 2\", which attained extremely limited theatrical distribution before being dumped on home video by Carolco's subsidiary, Live Entertainment.\n\nIn January 2017, Tom Holland announced that he was writing a \"Fright Night 3\" novel and that in 2019 he would obtain the rights to the franchise and that a third film would be happening. This would follow the continuity as the original 1985 \"Fright Night\" and its 1988 sequel without anything to do with the 2011 or 2013 films.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2203410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203410", "title": "Genetic relationship (linguistics)", "text": "Genetic relationship (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, genetic relationship or genealogical relationship are terms for the relationship which exists between languages that are members of the same language family. The traditional term \"genetic relationship\" is increasingly replaced by \"genealogical relationship\" in recent literature to avoid confusion with the unrelated use of the term in biological genetics. Languages that possess genetic ties with one another belong to the same linguistic grouping, known as a language family. These ties are established through use of the comparative method of linguistic analysis.\n\nTwo languages are considered to be genetically related if one is descended from the other or if both are descended from a common ancestor. For example, the Romance languages are called as such because they are descended from Vulgar Latin; therefore, languages like Spanish, Italian and French are therefore said to be genetically related, as well as the former three are to Latin. In a similar way, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian are genetically related through the North Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.\n\nThe classification of languages into language families begins by making a list of words in the potential languages that exhibit lexical and grammatical similarities; that is, they are similar in sound and meaning. The next step is to determine how the similarities originated. There are three possibilities: convergence, borrowing and common origin. Convergence is the chance similarity of sound and meaning of a word in two different languages and \"is based on the principle that a word is an arbitrary association of sound and meaning\". An example of convergence is that many unrelated languages have words similar to \"mama\" and \"papa\" for 'mother' and 'father'. Borrowing results from the exchanging of words between languages in close contact with one another. Once convergence and borrowing have been eliminated as possible explanations for similarities in sound and meaning of words, the last explanation is common origin. It can be assumed that the similarities occurred due to descent from a common ancestor, and the words are known as cognates. The set of all cognates of a word is the etymology of the word.\n\nWhen languages are in contact with one another, either of them may influence the other through linguistic interference such as borrowing. For example, French has influenced English, Arabic has influenced Persian, and Chinese has influenced Japanese in this way. However, such influence does not constitute (and is not a measure of) a genetic relationship between the languages concerned. Linguistic interference can occur between languages that are genetically closely related, between languages that are distantly related (like English and French, which are distantly related Indo-European languages) and between languages that have no genetic relationship.\n\nOne theory concerning genetic relationships among languages is monogenesisthe idea that all known languages, with the exceptions of creoles, pidgins and sign languages, are descendant from a single ancestral language.\n\nA common visual representation of a language family is given by a genetic language tree. The tree model is sometimes termed a dendrogram or phylogeny. The family tree shows the relationship of the languages within in a family, much as a family tree of an individual shows their relationship with their relatives. There are criticisms to the family tree model. Critics focus mainly on the claim that the internal structure of the trees is subject to variation based on the criteria of classification. Even among those who support the family tree model, there are debates over which languages should be included in a language family. For example, within the dubious Altaic language family, there are debates over whether the Japonic and Koreanic languages should be included or not.\n\nThe wave model has been proposed as an alternative to the tree model. The wave model uses isoglosses to group language varieties; unlike in the tree model, these groups can overlap. While the tree model implies a lack of contact between languages after derivation from an ancestral form, the wave model emphasizes the relationship between languages that remain in contact, which is more realistic.\n\nSome problems encountered by the genetic relationship group of languages include language isolates and mixed, pidgin and creole languages. Mixed languages, pidgins and creole languages constitute special genetic types of languages. They do not descend linearly or directly from a single language and have no single ancestor. Language isolates are languages that are unrelated to other languages. Each language isolate is considered to be a single language family with one language according to the \"Ethnologue\". Including language isolates when counting language families considerably increases the number of language families.\n\n"}

{"id": "2203415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203415", "title": "The Machines (professional wrestling)", "text": "The Machines (professional wrestling)\n\nThe Machines were a professional wrestling stable that performed in the World Wrestling Federation in 1986 and 1987. The team consisted of well-known WWF wrestlers working under masks which strongly resembled that worn by Super Strong Machine in New Japan Pro Wrestling at the time; leader André the Giant had faced Hirata and two other Strong Machines during tours of NJPW in 1984, getting the idea for the masks. The gimmick was very much tongue-in-cheek, as the identities of the masked men were obvious to the fans but frustrating to heels when they were unable to prove them. The Machines was the last tag team Capt. Lou Albano managed in the WWF until he returned in 1994 to manage The Headshrinkers.\n\nAfter feuding intensely with André for more than a year, Bobby Heenan's Heenan Family challenged André and a partner of his choice to face King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd in a tag team match on April 26, 1986. When André did not show and was replaced by Ted Arcidi, Bobby Heenan launched a campaign to get him suspended from the WWF. After deliberating on the matter, WWF President Jack Tunney was forced to suspend him for missing the tag team match and subsequent matches against the Heenan Family. This was part of a wrestling storyline, to allow André time off for production of the film \"The Princess Bride\" which was being filmed in the UK and also to allow him to fulfill a contracted tour of Japan. He was also beginning to develop health problems from the gigantism that caused his size that led him to having major back surgery and limited his wrestling ability at that time.\n\nLess than two months after the suspension was announced, vignettes appeared on WWF Television hailing the debut of a masked tag team from the Orient, known as \"The Machines\": Giant Machine and Super Machine. The team announced that they were coming to America soon with their manager Lou Albano and that their only mission was to prove that they were the number one tag team in the world. Super Machine was portrayed by Bill Eadie. His ring name was a play on his previous gimmick \"Masked Superstar\". Though it was clear that Giant Machine was none other than André the Giant, commentators sold that Giant Machine might be Giant Baba, and not André, under the mask. In televised interviews with Studd and Bundy, Studd would question the two smaller Machines being Japanese as one had a West Texas accent (Big Machine/Mulligan) and the other had a \"New York accent\" (Super Machine/Eadie). On the WWF show \"Tuesday Night Titans\", Heenan claimed he knew of no Japanese wrestler who was 7'4\" tall, weighed over 500 lbs and spoke with a French accent.\n\nIn the following weeks, Bobby Heenan made repeated claims that Giant Machine was André the Giant attempting to circumvent his suspension. To illustrate the obviousness of the ruse, Heenan went so far as to introduce his \"new team from Korea\" on an episode of Jesse Ventura’s \"Body Shop\". The team was merely King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd wearing paper bags over their heads. Heenan's claims led to Jack Tunney decreeing that if the Giant Machine was revealed to be André, André's suspension would become permanent.\n\nOn August 5 (shown August 23), The Machines made their WWF debut with Super Machine wrestling in a singles match while Albano and Giant Machine were at ringside. Later that night, Bobby Heenan sneaked around at ringside taking pictures of the Giant Machine to try to prove his true identity. One week later, Albano introduced a third Machine to the WWF: Big Machine, who was played by Blackjack Mulligan. André had been suffering from (legitimate) severe back injuries, and the introduction of the Big Machine character was meant to reduce André's wrestling role. \"The Machines\" angle was designed to put him in a lighter tag-team role. Due to the severity of the back injury, Mulligan was brought in to reduce André's wrestling role even further, thereby keeping the popular superstar on TV.\n\nBig Machine and Super Machine wrestled the majority of the matches against Bobby Heenan's cronies, occasionally with Lou Albano joining them to face Bundy, Studd and Heenan in six man tag-team action. Soon, other masked wrestlers (whose identities were generally obvious) appeared and temporarily teamed with The Machines. On September 10, Big and Super Machine were joined by Animal Machine to defeat King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd and Bobby Heenan. On September 16 the Machines were joined by Hulk Machine as the trio defeated the Heenan Family. The Hulk Machine returned on September 22 and helped the Machines win in the main event at the Madison Square Garden. A few weeks later the Machines received help from the kilt-wearing Piper Machine. On a house show in St. Paul, Minnesota the Machines even got the help of Crusher Machine, pinning John Studd to gain the victory for his team. On October 28, The Machines wrestled their last match under that gimmick, a loss to Bundy and Studd. This also marked the last appearance as a manager in the WWF for Lou Albano.\n\nAfter the Machines last match was shown on November 23, the angle was ended and André was announced as being reinstated on November 29. In the following weeks the mystery of why André the Giant was reinstated built up until it was revealed that Bobby Heenan had arranged for the suspension to end so he could turn on Hulk Hogan in the buildup to WrestleMania III. After the angle ended Eadie (Super Machine) was repackaged as Ax, one half of Demolition while Big Machine worked for the WWF as Blackjack Mulligan (Windham's best-known wrestling identity) in late 1986 and the first half of 1987 before leaving the promotion.\n\n"}

The game is the third installment of the \"Bases Loaded\" series.\n\nThe object of the game is to win an exhibition game of baseball, as the game does not have a season play option. After an exhibition game is completed, the player is given a numerical score based thirteen categories, including batting, errors, and spectacular plays. The score ranges from 1 to 100, but a player can score over 100 points by earning bonus points for jumping and diving catches.\n\nWhile Jaleco did hire famed baseball player Ryne Sandberg for an endorsement, this installment of the game did not feature real teams or players. More unpopular with players, however, was the somewhat bizarre premise that \"playing a perfect game\", not winning a pennant, was the game's ultimate goal. Regardless, there would be one more NES Bases Loaded title, as well as several Super NES titles.\n\nThe game is the third in the NES \"Bases Loaded\" series, following \"Bases Loaded II\".\n\nBoth the US and Japanese versions of the game contain staff credits. Both versions have the same exact staff credits except the composer. In the Japanese version, the composer is credited as \"God of Soul\". In the USA version, he is credited as \"Music Lover\". This is an alias for Tatsuya Nishimura (as revealed in Bases Loaded 4).

He is renowned for inventing military effective napalm whilst he worked at Harvard in 1942.\nHis award-winning research included work on blood-clotting agents including the first synthesis of vitamin K, synthesis and screening of quinones as antimalarial drugs, work with steroids leading to the synthesis of cortisone, and study of the nature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\n\nFieser was born in Columbus, Ohio, obtained his BA in chemistry in 1920 from Williams College, and his PhD under James Bryant Conant at Harvard in 1924. His graduate research concerned the measurement of oxidation potentials in quinone oxidation. in 1924-1925 Fieser worked at the University of Oxford with W.H. Perkin Jr. and with Julius von Braun at the Frankfurt University as a postdoc. Between 1925 and 1930 he worked at Bryn Mawr College where he met his future wife. He then moved to Harvard University.\n\nWith his research assistant and wife Mary Peters Fieser (MA, 1936, Radcliffe) he coauthored eight books and the first seven volumes of the classic series \"Reagents for Organic Synthesis\" known popularly among chemists as \"Fieser and Fieser\". He was also an editor and contributor for \"Organic Syntheses\".\n\nFieser had two chemical reagents named for him. \"Fieser's reagent\" is a mixture of chromium trioxide in acetic acid. \"Fieser's solution\" is an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, sodium hydrosulfite, and sodium anthraquinone b-sulfonate used for the removal of oxygen from a gas stream. Woodward's rules for calculating UV absorption maxima are also known as the Woodward-Fieser rules. He was the first to propose the existence of iceane.\n\nIn 1939 Fieser was involved in a competitive race for the structure elucidation of Vitamin K and he was able to report its synthesis in the end of that year. According to a recent \"in memoriam\" Fieser was a contender for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1941 and 1942 (when no prizes were actually awarded). However the 1943 award was shared between Henrik Dam for the discovery of vitamin K and Edward A. Doisy for the discovery of its chemical nature.\n\nDuring World War II Fieser was partly responsible for a military experiment that went disastrously awry. \"Project X-ray\" was a scheme to drop a great number of bats with small incendiary charges with a timed fuse attached over Japan to start widespread fires. After the bats nested in housing and factories, the timed fuses would ignite the incendiary charges (napalm) and start the fires. During a test run, a number of the bats escaped and ignited Carlsbad Airfield's hangars, barracks, and a general's car. \"The accidental incineration of Carlsbad Auxiliary Army Airfield by incendiary bats was both a high and a low for Project X-Ray.\" Fieser omitted the account of the fires from his own account of the bat tests.\n\nDow Chemical began producing his formula for Napalm during World War II. The use of Napalm during the Vietnam War stirred controversy. Fieser, however, was unapologetic for its creation. He stated, \"I have no right to judge the morality of Napalm just because I invented it.\"\n\nIn 1962 he served on the \"U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory Committee\" that in 1964 issued a report on the relationship between . Fieser was a chain smoker, and only after he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1965 and recovered did he quit the habit and start to actively promote the committee's conclusions.\n\nFieser was the graduate advisor of 1987 Nobel laureate Donald J.

His influence is still widely felt and his legacy continues to grow among Christians both in Russia and abroad. He was murdered early on a Sunday morning, on 9 September 1990, by an ax-wielding assailant outside his home in Semkhoz, Russia.\n\nMen was born in Moscow to a Jewish family on 22 January 1935. He was baptized at six months along with his mother in the banned Catacomb Church, a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church that refused to cooperate with the Soviet authorities.\n\nWhen Men was 6 years old, the NKVD arrested his father, Volf Gersh-Leybovich (Vladimir Grigoryevich) Men (born 1902). Volf spent more than a year under guard and then was assigned to labor in the Ural Mountains. His son Alexander studied at the Moscow Fur-and-Down Institute in 1955 and transferred to Irkutsk Agriculture Institute from which was expelled in 1958 due to his religious beliefs. In the same year one month after his expulsion, he was ordained a deacon. In, 1960 he became a priest upon graduating from the Leningrad Theological Seminary. In 1965, he completed studies at Moscow Theological Academy.\n\nAlexander Men became a leader with considerable influence and a good reputation among Christians both locally and abroad, among Roman Catholics and Protestants, as well as Orthodox. He served in a series of parishes near Moscow. A unique combination of broad erudition, openness to secular culture, science, to other confessions, to non-Christian religions, and deep Christian roots from the Catacomb Church propelled him into the ranks of leading Christian preachers.\n\nStarting in the early 1970s, Men became a popular figure in Russia's religious community, especially among the intelligentsia. Men was harassed by the KGB for his active missionary and evangelistic efforts. In the late-1980s, he utilised the mass media to spread the message of Christ (he was offered to host a nationally televised program on religion); his days and nights were full of teaching and lecturing at packed lecture halls. Men was one of the founders of the Russian Bible Society in 1990; that same year he founded the Open Orthodox University and \"The World of the Bible\" journal. His strenuous efforts in educating the Russian populace in the basics and dynamics of the Orthodox faith has garnered him the label as a modern-day apostle to the Soviet people. However, some representatives of the Orthodox circles and those interested in Orthodoxy evaluated the views of Father Alexander as being not fully “orthodox”, and advised against using his books as an introduction to Orthodoxy.\n\nOn Sunday morning, 9 September 1990, he was murdered while walking along the wooded path from his home in the Russian village of Semkhoz to the local train platform. He was on his way to catch the train to Novaya Derevnya to celebrate the Divine Liturgy. Men had served at the parish in Novaya Derevnya for 20 years. His assailant's or assailants' use of an axe indicated a possible revenge motive. The murder occurred around the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and despite orders from within the Soviet (and later the Russian) government that the case be further investigated, the murder remains unsolved. His funeral was held on the day in the Orthodox calendar which commemorates the beheading of John the Baptist.\n\nSince his death, Men's works and ideas have been seen as controversial among the conservative faction of the Russian Orthodox Church, citing his strong tendencies towards ecumenism which his books advocate. Nonetheless, Men has a considerable number of supporters, some of whom argue for his canonization. His lectures are regularly broadcast over Russian radio. His books are published freely in Russia nowadays. During his lifetime, they had to be printed abroad; mainly in Brussels, Belgium by the publishing house Foyer Chrétien Oriental and circulated in secret. Several key Russian Orthodox parishes encourage following his example as one who faithfully followed Christ. Two Russian Orthodox churches have been built on the site of his assassination and a growing number of believers in both Russia and abroad consider him a martyr.\n\nIn conjunction with the 25th year Commemoration of Memory, the Moscow Patriarchate Izdatel'stvo publishing house has begun a project to publish Fr. Men's \"Collected Works\" in a series of 15 volumes.\n\nMen's son, Mikhail Men, is a Russian political figure who from 2005 to 2013 served as the Governor of Ivanovo Oblast and now as Minister of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector in Dmitry Medvedev's Cabinet. He is also a musician known outside Russia for the Michael Men Project.\n\nAlexander Men's greatest work is his \"History of Religion,\" published in seven volumes under the title \"In Search of the Way, the Truth, and the Life\" (volumes 1–6, Brussels, 1970–1983; 2nd edition Moscow, 1991–1992) in which the author examines the history of non-Christian religions as a way for Christians in the struggle of Magiism and Monotheism. Also including as the seventh volume his most famous work, \"Son of Man\" (Brussels, 1969; 2nd edition Moscow, 1991). Because of the persecution in the Soviet Union at the time, the Brussels editions were published under a pseudonym.\nFather Alexander Men was one of the first pioneers of Christian “samizdat” (self-publishing) of the 1960s.\n\nAn English translation of \"Son of Man\" by Mormon author Samuel Brown was completed in 1998, but is now out of print, as are several other works in English translation. In 2014, a new project was commenced by Revd Alastair Macnaughton (1954–2017), an Anglican priest and Russian scholar, to translate the entire \"History of Religion,\" into the English language for the first time. Volume 1 was published in 2018.\nRecent works of Alexander Men in English translation include:\n\n\nMany other works by Alexander Men have been published in Russian, most notably:\n\n\n\n"}

In his obituary, \"The Washington Post\" described him as \"a professional wrestler whose blue-collar bona fides made him beloved among working class fans for 40 years\". He was most successful in the American Midwest, often teaming with Dick the Bruiser.\n\nLisowski was born on July 11, 1926 and raised in the Milwaukee suburb of South Milwaukee. Early on he was more interested in football, playing fullback for the South Milwaukee High School football team, but took up wrestling while stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army. Having developed a liking for the sport, he continued training with Ivan Racy and Buck Tassie at Milwaukee's Eagles Club when he returned, eventually wrestling Marcel Buchet in his first recorded match late in 1949.\n\nHis early career included wrestling three to four nights per week at a Chicago armory, typically earning $5 a night. To support himself and to stay in shape, Lisowski worked various blue collar jobs by day, from meat packing to bricklaying. Fred Kohler was the first promoter to put him on TV, and by 1954 he had developed a barrel-chested physique that would stick with him for most of his career. Decades before Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Sandman, Lisowski perfected the gimmick of the beer drinking tough guy. To further his career he bleached his dark hair blonde and started to get over as a strongman heel, famous for his bolo punch as well as a devastating full nelson. This eventually led to him winning the Chicago-area NWA World Tag Team Championship with partner Art Nielson.\n\nLisowski continued to have tag team success throughout the remainder of the 1950s, often paired with his wrestling \"brother\" Stan Lisowski. By 1959, he was being billed as \"Crusher\" Lisowski, which legend came from a promoter's off-hand comment that he \"just crushes everybody.\" Until early 1965, Crusher was a heel (hated bad guy) in the AWA. After meeting the team of Larry Hennig & Harley Race for the first time, the fans adopted Crusher and his wrestling \"cousin\" Dick the Bruiser as full-fledged heroes in AWA territory. His bluster was legendary, as he would threaten to maul opponents in the ring and afterward \"have a party, take all the dollies down Wisconsin Avenue, drink beer and dance the polka.\" Besides his impressive physique, The Crusher's gimmick was to absorb a tremendous amount of punishment and still be able to make a comeback for the win.\n\nOver the next 15 to 20 years Crusher and Bruiser were tag partners off and on, and a natural combination due to their common background and brawling wrestling style. If Dick the Bruiser and Crusher felt they hadn't bloodied their opponents enough during a match, they would trade punches with each other afterwards. They won the AWA World Tag Team Championship 5 times, the WWA Tag Team Titles (the WWA was Dick \"Bruiser\" Afflis's promotion) 6 times, and the NWA International Tag Titles among others.\n\nIntroduced at the beginning of wrestling matches as \"The Wrestler That Made Milwaukee Famous\" (a play on the slogan for Schlitz, \"The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous\"), Crusher was successful as a solo wrestler, winning the AWA World Heavyweight Championship three times, the first time unifying it with the Omaha version of the World Heavyweight Championship on July 9, 1963, in a match where he defeated Verne Gagne. He was skillful at cutting promos, as he would brag about his \"100 megaton biceps\" and offer to pummel \"da bum\" he was facing in the ring with ease, and he often delighted in calling opponents \"turkeynecks.\" His most quotable and famous phrase though was: \"How 'bout 'dat?\" When asked how he trained for a match, he'd claim he ran along the waterfront in Milwaukee carrying a large full beer barrel over either shoulder for strength (and longtime AWA announcer Rodger Kent often noted that by the end of the Crusher's training run, the beer was gone), and that he'd dance polka all night with Polish barmaids to increase his stamina. Although much of Crusher's popularity came from the idea that he was a big beer drinker, in actuality, he never drank beer, and according to Baron Von Raschke, he actually preferred wine.\n\nThe Crusher's wrestling career almost ended in 1981, when the 450-pound Jerry Blackwell botched a top rope move and landed on Lisowski's right arm, causing nerve damage from his shoulder all the way to his wrist. Doctors told him he'd never wrestle again, but Crusher did strength training for two years while he was unofficially \"retired,\" returning to the ring in 1983.\n\nHe also had a successful run in the WWF in the early 1960s where he was a nemesis of Johnny Valentine and a very young Bruno Sammartino, primarily in the Pittsburgh promotion. He drew very large crowds to Forbes Field with battles against each man.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, seeing that the American Wrestling Association (AWA) promotion with which he had the most success over the years was crumbling, particularly when Hulk Hogan and many of the other top talent jumped ship to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Crusher went to work for McMahon on a part-time basis, appearing at WWF house shows all over the Midwest. Lisowski claimed that he made more money working part-time for McMahon than he did working for the frugal Gagne on a full-time basis.\n\nIn 1986, Lisowski occasionally teamed with The Machines as Crusher Machine.\n\nThe Crusher's last match was at a WWF house show in Omaha on February 15, 1988. He replaced Billy Jack Haynes to team with Ken Patera and face Demolition, who were disqualified when Mr. Fuji tripped Crusher with a cane about three minutes in.\n\nThe Crusher's last television appearance was at WWF's 1998 pay-per-view where was shown sitting alongside Mad Dog Vachon in the front row. Jerry Lawler made fun of the two men's age, and tried to steal Vachon's artificial leg, but Vachon hit him over the head with it, and Crusher punched him. As Lawler bailed, the two former enemies shook hands.\n\nIn 1964, the Minneapolis-based garage rock band The Novas wrote a song dedicated to him called \"The Crusher\", with lead singer Bob Nolan imitating the raunchy voice of Crusher Lisowski (and his trademark yell at the beginning of the record). The tune, which included the lyrics \"Do the hammer lock, you turkeynecks!\" was popular in the upper Midwest and made it to #88 on the national \"Billboard\" chart. It was later covered by The Cramps on their album \"Psychedelic Jungle\". The song has received a resurgence of popularity in recent years, as David Letterman has often played it on his late-night talk show. The Ramones released a song entitled \"The Crusher\" paying tribute to Lisowski on their last studio recorded album, \"Adios Amigos\".\n\nOn June 8, 2019, a bronze statue of The Crusher was unveiled in South Milwaukee at 1101 Milwaukee Avenue. South Milwaukee Mayor Erik Brooks declared the day \"Reggie 'Da Crusher' Lisowski Day\" in his memory.\n\nA few weeks later on August 24, 2019, surveillance video captured two men striking the statue with a concrete block, damaging the nose, cheek and chest. Da Crusher’s family noticed the damage Aug. 29 and reported it to police. James Dudgeon, 18, of South Milwaukee was charged with criminal damage to property. Additionally, 21-year-old Douglas Macklin of Pembine, Wisconsin, was charged Sept. 19 in connection with the vandalism. According to a criminal complaint, Dudgeon identified Macklin as his accomplice. Police also found a photo of Macklin on his Facebook page wearing the same shirt he is seen wearing in the video.\n\nIn 1974, he and Dick the Bruiser starred in the movie \"The Wrestler\", where they beat up a posse of mobsters on the big screen.\n\nIn his later years, multiple surgeries on his hips and knee crippled him, as well as a non-cancerous tumor removed from his brain stem in March 2005, which left Lisowski partially paralyzed.\n\nLisowski's wife Faye died in March 2003 after the couple were married for 55 years. Lisowski died of a brain tumor on October 22, 2005, at age 79. He, his wife, Faye, and infant son Gary are interred at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery near Milwaukee. He was survived by four children, nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.\n\nGagne reacted to his death by saying to the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\", \"We had some dandy matches. The Crusher never was a great technically skilled wrestler, but he was tougher than nails and a brawler. He could bench press nearly 600 pounds. And he loved to have fun. After a match, he couldn't get a beer in his hands fast enough.\"\n\n\n\n"}

A lieutenant in the Imperial Russian military, he was commissioned to lead an expedition to Japan in 1791, returning two Japanese castaways to their home country in exchange for trade concessions from the Tokugawa shogunate. He was the son of Erik Laxman.\n\nLaxman landed on Hokkaidō in October 1792, where he was met by members of the Matsumae clan, who were entrusted with defending Japan's northern borders. Unlike previous foreign visitors, Laxman was treated hospitably, but this changed when he demanded, imprudently, that he be able to deliver the castaways (Daikokuya Kōdayū's party) to Edo (modern-day Tokyo) in person. He was soon met by two envoys and five hundred men, sent from Edo by senior councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu, who attempted to delay or prevent Laxman's traveling much deeper into Japanese territory. They asked that he travel to the town of Matsumae, overland and without his ship. Laxman refused, and ultimately was allowed to sail, with Japanese naval escort, to the port of Hakodate; from there, 450 Russians and Japanese would march to Matsumae Castle.\n\nOddly, despite his impudence, Laxman was granted lavish Western-style living quarters; they were allowed to ignore the custom of kneeling and bowing before the Shogun's envoys, and were bestowed three samurai swords, and a hundred bags of rice. The envoys then explained to him that Japanese law demanded that all foreign trade be performed at Nagasaki. Since he had come to return castaways, they explained, he would be allowed to leave peacefully. When Laxman refused to leave without a trade agreement, he was provided with papers that explicitly stated that Nagasaki would welcome one Russian ship, that foreign ships were not allowed to dock anywhere else in the country, and that Christianity would also not be tolerated anywhere in Japan.\n\nLaxman returned to Russia essentially empty-handed, though he held (quite possibly) the first official Japanese documents granting permission to trade, to a nation other than China or the Netherlands. In 1804–1805, nine years after Laxman's return to Russia, an attempt was made to trade at Nagasaki as part of the expedition around the world led by Adam Johann von Krusenstern, but the Russian ambassador Nikolai Rezanov was greeted with a lengthy dispatch from the Shogunate explaining that Japan was closed to foreign trade and demanding that they leave. After this major setback, the Tsarist government debated for many years the actual intention and meaning of the documents, and, leaving the opening of Japan to private entrepreneur explorers, ultimately failed to open Japan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2203507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203507", "title": "Futures and promises", "text": "Futures and promises\n\nIn computer science, future, promise, delay, and deferred refer to constructs used for synchronizing program execution in some concurrent programming languages. They describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the computation of its value is not yet complete.\n\nThe term \"promise\" was proposed in 1976 by Daniel P. Friedman and David Wise,\nand Peter Hibbard called it \"eventual\".\nA somewhat similar concept \"future\" was introduced in 1977 in a paper by Henry Baker and Carl Hewitt.\n\nThe terms \"future\", \"promise\", \"delay\", and \"deferred\" are often used interchangeably, although some differences in usage between \"future\" and \"promise\" are treated below. Specifically, when usage is distinguished, a future is a \"read-only\" placeholder view of a variable, while a promise is a writable, single assignment container which sets the value of the future. Notably, a future may be defined without specifying which specific promise will set its value, and different possible promises may set the value of a given future, though this can be done only once for a given future. In other cases a future and a promise are created together and associated with each other: the future is the value, the promise is the function that sets the value – essentially the return value (future) of an asynchronous function (promise). Setting the value of a future is also called \"resolving\", \"fulfilling\", or \"binding\" it.\n\nFutures and promises originated in functional programming and related paradigms (such as logic programming) to decouple a value (a future) from how it was computed (a promise), allowing the computation to be done more flexibly, notably by parallelizing it. Later, it found use in distributed computing, in reducing the latency from communication round trips. Later still, it gained more use by allowing writing asynchronous programs in direct style, rather than in continuation-passing style.\n\nUse of futures may be \"implicit\" (any use of the future automatically obtains its value, as if it were an ordinary reference) or \"explicit\" (the user must call a function to obtain the value, such as the codice_1 method of or in Java). Obtaining the value of an explicit future can be called \"stinging\" or \"forcing\". Explicit futures can be implemented as a library, whereas implicit futures are usually implemented as part of the language.\n\nThe original Baker and Hewitt paper described implicit futures, which are naturally supported in the actor model of computation and pure object-oriented programming languages like Smalltalk. The Friedman and Wise paper described only explicit futures, probably reflecting the difficulty of efficiently implementing implicit futures on stock hardware. The difficulty is that stock hardware does not deal with futures for primitive data types like integers. For example, an add instruction does not know how to deal with codice_2. In pure actor or object languages this problem can be solved by sending codice_3 the message codice_4, which asks the future to add codice_5 to itself and return the result. Note that the message passing approach works regardless of when codice_6 finishes computation and that no stinging/forcing is needed.\n\nThe use of futures can dramatically reduce latency in distributed systems. For instance, futures enable \"promise pipelining\", as implemented in the languages E and Joule, which was also called \"call-stream\" in the language Argus.\n\nConsider an expression involving conventional remote procedure calls, such as:\n\nwhich could be expanded to\n\nEach statement needs a message to be sent and a reply received before the next statement can proceed. Suppose, for example, that codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, and codice_10 are all located on the same remote machine. In this case, two complete network round-trips to that machine must take place before the third statement can begin to execute. The third statement will then cause yet another round-trip to the same remote machine.\n\nUsing futures, the above expression could be written\nwhich could be expanded to\nThe syntax used here is that of the language E, where codice_11 means to send the message codice_12 asynchronously to codice_7. All three variables are immediately assigned futures for their results, and execution proceeds to subsequent statements. Later attempts to resolve the value of codice_14 may cause a delay; however, pipelining can reduce the number of round-trips needed. If, as in the prior example, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, and codice_10 are all located on the same remote machine, a pipelined implementation can compute codice_14 with one round-trip instead of three. Because all three messages are destined for objects which are on the same remote machine, only one request need be sent and only one response need be received containing the result. The send codice_20 would not block even if codice_9 and codice_10 were on different machines to each other, or to codice_7 or codice_8.\n\nPromise pipelining should be distinguished from parallel asynchronous message passing. In a system supporting parallel message passing but not pipelining, the message sends codice_11 and codice_26 in the above example could proceed in parallel, but the send of codice_20 would have to wait until both codice_9 and codice_10 had been received, even when codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, and codice_10 are on the same remote machine. The relative latency advantage of pipelining becomes even greater in more complicated situations involving many messages.\n\nPromise pipelining also should not be confused with pipelined message processing in actor systems, where it is possible for an actor to specify and begin executing a behaviour for the next message before having completed processing of the current message.\n\nIn some programming languages such as Oz, E, and AmbientTalk, it is possible to obtain a \"read-only view\" of a future, which allows reading its value when resolved, but does not permit resolving it:\n\n\nSupport for read-only views is consistent with the principle of least privilege, since it enables the ability to set the value to be restricted to subjects that need to set it. In a system that also supports pipelining, the sender of an asynchronous message (with result) receives the read-only promise for the result, and the target of the message receives the resolver.\n\nSome languages, such as Alice ML, define futures that are associated with a specific thread that computes the future's value. This computation can start either eagerly when the future is created, or lazily when its value is first needed. A lazy future is similar to a thunk, in the sense of a delayed computation.\n\nAlice ML also supports futures that can be resolved by any thread, and calls these \"promises\". This use of \"promise\" is different from its use in E as described above. In Alice, a promise is not a read-only view, and promise pipelining is unsupported. Instead, pipelining naturally happens for futures, including ones associated with promises.\n\nIf the value of a future is accessed asynchronously, for example by sending a message to it, or by explicitly waiting for it using a construct such as codice_41 in E, then there is no difficulty in delaying until the future is resolved before the message can be received or the wait completes. This is the only case to be considered in purely asynchronous systems such as pure actor languages.\n\nHowever, in some systems it may also be possible to attempt to \"immediately\" or \"synchronously\" access a future's value. Then there is a design choice to be made:\n\n\nAs an example of the first possibility, in C++11, a thread that needs the value of a future can block until it is available by calling the codice_42 or codice_43 member functions. You can also specify a timeout on the wait using the codice_44 or codice_45 member functions to avoid indefinite blocking. If the future arose from a call to codice_38 then a blocking wait (without a timeout) may cause synchronous invocation of the function to compute the result on the waiting thread.\n\n\"Future\" is a particular case of Event (synchronization primitive), which can be completed only once. In general, events can be reset to initial empty state and, thus, completed as many times as you like.\n\nAn \"I-var\" (as in the language Id) is a future with blocking semantics as defined above. An \"I-structure\" is a data structure containing I-vars. A related synchronization construct that can be set multiple times with different values is called an \"M-var\". M-vars support atomic operations to \"take\" or \"put\" the current value, where taking the value also sets the M-var back to its initial \"empty\" state.\n\nA \"concurrent logic variable\" is similar to a future, but is updated by unification, in the same way as \"logic variables\" in logic programming. Thus it can be bound more than once to unifiable values, but cannot be set back to an empty or unresolved state. The dataflow variables of Oz act as concurrent logic variables, and also have blocking semantics as mentioned above.\n\nA \"concurrent constraint variable\" is a generalization of concurrent logic variables to support constraint logic programming: the constraint may be \"narrowed\" multiple times, indicating smaller sets of possible values. Typically there is a way to specify a thunk that should run whenever the constraint is narrowed further; this is needed to support \"constraint propagation\".\n\nEager thread-specific futures can be straightforwardly implemented in non-thread-specific futures, by creating a thread to calculate the value at the same time as creating the future. In this case it is desirable to return a read-only view to the client, so that only the newly created thread is able to resolve this future.\n\nTo implement implicit lazy thread-specific futures (as provided by Alice ML, for example) in terms in non-thread-specific futures, needs a mechanism to determine when the future's value is first needed (for example, the codice_47 construct in Oz). If all values are objects, then the ability to implement transparent forwarding objects is sufficient, since the first message sent to the forwarder indicates that the future's value is needed.\n\nNon-thread-specific futures can be implemented in thread-specific futures, assuming that the system supports message passing, by having the resolving thread send a message to the future's own thread. However, this can be viewed as unneeded complexity. In programming languages based on threads, the most expressive approach seems to be to provide a mix of non-thread-specific futures, read-only views, and either a \"WaitNeeded\" construct, or support for transparent forwarding.\n\nThe evaluation strategy of futures, which may be termed \"call by future\", is non-deterministic: the value of a future will be evaluated at some time between when the future is created and when its value is used, but the precise time is not determined beforehand and can change from run to run. The computation can start as soon as the future is created (eager evaluation) or only when the value is actually needed (lazy evaluation), and may be suspended part-way through, or executed in one run. Once the value of a future is assigned, it is not recomputed on future accesses; this is like the memoization used in call by need.\n\nA is a future that deterministically has lazy evaluation semantics: the computation of the future's value starts when the value is first needed, as in call by need. Lazy futures are of use in languages which evaluation strategy is by default not lazy. For example, in C++11 such lazy futures can be created by passing the codice_48 launch policy to codice_38, along with the function to compute the value.\n\nIn the actor model, an expression of the form codice_50 is defined by how it responds to an codice_51 message with environment \"E\" and customer \"C\" as follows: The future expression responds to the codice_51 message by sending the customer \"C\" a newly created actor \"F\" (the proxy for the response of evaluating codice_53) as a return value \"concurrently\" with sending codice_53 an codice_51 message with environment \"E\" and customer \"C\". The default behavior of \"F\" is as follows:\n\n\nHowever, some futures can deal with requests in special ways to provide greater parallelism. For example, the expression codice_58 can create a new future that will behave like the number codice_59. This trick does not always work. For example, the following conditional expression:\nsuspends until the future for codice_61 has responded to the request asking if codice_62 is greater than itself.\n\nThe \"future\" and/or \"promise\" constructs were first implemented in programming languages such as MultiLisp and Act 1. The use of logic variables for communication in concurrent logic programming languages was quite similar to futures. These began in \"Prolog with Freeze\" and \"IC Prolog\", and became a true concurrency primitive with Relational Language, Concurrent Prolog, guarded Horn clauses (GHC), Parlog, Strand, Vulcan, Janus, Oz-Mozart, Flow Java, and Alice ML. The single-assignment \"I-var\" from dataflow programming languages, originating in Id and included in Reppy's \"Concurrent ML\", is much like the concurrent logic variable.\n\nThe promise pipelining technique (using futures to overcome latency) was invented by Barbara Liskov and Liuba Shrira in 1988, and independently by Mark S. Miller, Dean Tribble and Rob Jellinghaus in the context of Project Xanadu circa 1989.\n\nThe term \"promise\" was coined by Liskov and Shrira, although they referred to the pipelining mechanism by the name \"call-stream\", which is now rarely used.\n\nBoth the design described in Liskov and Shrira's paper, and the implementation of promise pipelining in Xanadu, had the limit that promise values were not first-class: an argument to, or the value returned by a call or send could not directly be a promise (so the example of promise pipelining given earlier, which uses a promise for the result of one send as an argument to another, would not have been directly expressible in the call-stream design or in the Xanadu implementation). It seems that promises and call-streams were never implemented in any public release of Argus, the programming language used in the Liskov and Shrira paper. Argus development stopped around 1988. The Xanadu implementation of promise pipelining only became publicly available with the release of the source code for Udanax Gold in 1999, and was never explained in any published document. The later implementations in Joule and E support fully first-class promises and resolvers.\n\nSeveral early actor languages, including the Act series, supported both parallel message passing and pipelined message processing, but not promise pipelining. (Although it is technically possible to implement the last of these features in the first two, there is no evidence that the Act languages did so.)\n\nAfter 2000, a major revival of interest in futures and promises occurred, due to their use in responsiveness of user interfaces, and in web development, due to the request–response model of message-passing. Several mainstream languages now have language support for futures and promises, most notably popularized by codice_63 in Java 5 (announced 2004) and the codice_64 and codice_65 constructions in .NET 4.5 (announced 2010, released 2012) largely inspired by the \"asynchronous workflows\" of F#, which dates to 2007. This has subsequently been adopted by other languages, notably Dart (2014), Python (2015), Hack (HHVM), and drafts of ECMAScript 7 (JavaScript), Scala, and C++.\n\nSome programming languages are supporting futures, promises, concurrent logic variables, dataflow variables, or I-vars, either by direct language support or in the standard library.\n\n\n\nLanguages also supporting promise pipelining include:\n\n\nFutures can be implemented in coroutines or generators, resulting in the same evaluation strategy (e.g., cooperative multitasking or lazy evaluation).\n\nFutures can easily be implemented in channels: a future is a one-element channel, and a promise is a process that sends to the channel, fulfilling the future. This allows futures to be implemented in concurrent programming languages with support for channels, such as CSP and Go. The resulting futures are explicit, as they must be accessed by reading from the channel, rather than only evaluation.\n\n\n"}

It was the first of two singles released from that LP. It peaked at number 94 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song was one of the band's early compositions about environmentalism, discussing acid rain. It also transitioned from their murky lyrics and jangling guitar of their first three albums to a more accessible sound influenced by producer Don Gehman.\n\nThough R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe once described the song as \"pretty much a song about oppression,\" the subject of the song was initially about acid rain and its effects on the environment, hence the first line of the chorus, \"Don't fall on me.\" \n\nWhen it first appeared during live concerts in 1985, the song had a different melody which had been entirely rewritten by the time of its recording for \"Lifes Rich Pageant\". The counter-melody in the second verse is actually the song's original tune and features the original acid rain inspired lyrics.\n\nIn an interview with David Fricke, singer Michael Stipe commented that the finished version of the song \"is not about acid rain. It's a general oppression song about the fact that there are a lot of causes out there that need a song that says, 'Don't smash us.' And specifically, there are references to the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the guy dropping weights and feathers.\"\n\nIn audience patter prior to a performance of the song on \"VH1 Storytellers\" in 1998, Stipe again mentioned the apocryphal tale of Galileo Galilei dropping feathers and lead weights off the Leaning Tower of Pisa (to test the laws of gravity) as partial inspiration for the first verse:“I was reading an article in Boston when I was on tour with the Golden Palominos, and Chris Stamey showed me this article about this guy that did an experiment from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, whereby he dropped a pound of feathers and a pound of iron to prove that there was... a difference in the... density? What did he prove? I don’t even know. [\"A man shouts out from the audience\"] What? [\"\"They fall just as fast,\" repeated the disembodied voice\"] They fall just as fast. Thank you very much.”\n\nThe song is something of a duet between Stipe and Mike Mills, with the two of them sharing vocals prominently during the bridge and chorus. Mills takes lead vocals for the bridge. Later in the song, the pair are joined by Bill Berry's vocals in the chorus with the words \"it's gonna fall\".\n\nStipe filmed and directed the video for this song, in which the lyrics are seen superimposed over upside-down, black-and-white footage of a quarry. Towards the end of the second verse, he misspelled the word 'Foresight'.\n\nAll songs written by Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Michael Stipe unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\nThe B-side to this single is an instrumental entitled \"Rotary Ten\", a song which has been described by guitarist Peter Buck as \"a movie theme without a movie.\" It would gain a sequel of sorts, \"Rotary Eleven\" for the \"Losing My Religion\" single in 1991.\n\nThe folk supergroup, Cry Cry Cry (Dar Williams, Richard Shindell, and Lucy Kaplansky) used \"Fall on Me\" as the opening track for their eponymous album of cover songs.\n\nTooth and Nail melodic rap duo Furthermore, covered the song on their 2002 album \"She and I\".\n\nMatt Nathanson included an acoustic cover of this song on the deluxe version of his 2013 album \"Last of the Great Pretenders\".\n"}

She currently co-hosts \"Good Day New York\" on Fox 5 NY WNYW, with Rosanna Scotto in New York City. From April 2000 to August 2017, she co-anchored on WABC-TV's \"Eyewitness News This Morning\", with Ken Rosato. Stokes joined the station as part of an effort to increase ratings on WABC's morning newscast and helped bring the broadcast to #1.\n\nStokes began her journalistic career as the medical reporter and then weekend co-anchor at WCIA in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois in 1986. Then, in 1988, she worked as a reporter and weekend anchor for WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina. There for two years, she became popular with the viewers in that state.\n\nNext, Stokes worked as a crime and street reporter for WBFF-TV, the Fox Station in Baltimore. Finally, Stokes got hands on experience for full-time anchor as WJLA-TV's lead female anchor of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts. She was there from 1992 through 1996.\n\nThen Stokes went to MSNBC at the time of its inception. She was one of the original anchors on the 24-hour cable news television channel and the first African American to speak on the cable news network. MSNBC hired newcomer \"girl in glasses\" Ashleigh Banfield to MSNBC in 2000 and replaced Stokes on MSNBC'S \"Today in America\" also in 2000. During her tenure at NBC News Stokes was a rotating newsreader for \"NBC Sunrise\" and \"Weekend Today\".\n\nDuring her tenure at the cable TV station, Stokes covered the Columbine High School Massacre and the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. in 1999.\n\nStokes was paired with Robb Hanrahan who, at the time, also co-anchored the station's 5 p.m. news with Roz Abrams and had previously co-anchored the morning news. The new pair, who replaced anchors Nancy Loo and David Ushery, did not work as well as WABC had hoped they would. Hanrahan was taken off the morning news in December 2000 and replaced with WABC-TV's weekend sports anchor Steve Bartelstein.\n\nStokes and Bartelstein proved to work well and eventually helped bring \"Eyewitness News This Morning\" back to the number one position it had enjoyed in previous years. The pair eventually took over anchoring duties for \"Eyewitness News at Noon\", replacing Nancy Loo and David Ushery once again.\n\nFor a brief time in 2003, Stokes was removed from the noon newscast and replaced with Sade Baderinwa. Stokes resumed anchoring the noon newscast when Roz Abrams left the station and was replaced by Baderinwa.\n\nFrom Tuesday, March 13, 2007, to Wednesday, July 4, 2007, (Independence Day), Stokes was the sole anchor of \"Eyewitness News This Morning\" and \"Eyewitness News at Noon\". She was joined by a rotating roster of reporters from March until July when reporter Ken Rosato was chosen to permanently replace Steve Bartelstein. Rosato officially took over on July 9, 2007, as her morning and noon co-anchor.\n\nIn fall 2010, the morning newscast expanded to begin at 4:30 a.m. and, in fall 2014, the noon news expanded to a full hour, which lengthened Stokes' and Rosato's already long days. As part of the expansion, WABC promised to relieve both of them of their noon duties in order to focus on the morning news. That promise was kept and, in June 2015, Stokes and Rosato handed over noon duties to David Navarro and Shirleen Allicot.\n\nLori Stokes left Eyewitness News in August 2017. It was announced that October 4, 2017, Stokes will start her first day and will co-host Good Day New York with Rosanna Scotto on Fox-5 WNYW replacing Greg Kelly, who has allegedly, left on his own terms at Fox 5 WNYW.\n\n\n"}

It begins with the history of same-sex unions during ancient times, which consisted of unions ranging from informal and temporary relationships to highly ritualized unions, and continues to modern-day state-recognized same-sex marriage. Events concerning same-sex marriages becoming legal in a country or in a country's state are listed in bold.\n\nVarious types of same-sex marriages have existed, ranging from informal, unsanctioned relationships to highly ritualized unions.\n\nCicero mentions the marriage (using the Latin verb for \"to marry\", i.e. nubere) of the son of Curio the Elder, but he does it in a metaphorical form to criticize his enemy Antonius. Cicero states thus that the younger Curio was \"united in a stable and permanent marriage\" to Antonius. Martial also mentions a number of same-sex marriages, but always in derisory terms against people whom he wants to mock.\n\nPractices and rituals for same sex unions were more recognized in Mesopotamia than in ancient Egypt. In ancient Assyria, there was considered to be nothing wrong with homosexual love between men. The Almanac of Incantations contained prayers giving equal standing to the love of a man for both a woman and a man.\n\nAt least two of the Roman Emperors were in same-sex unions; and in fact, thirteen out of the first fourteen Roman Emperors held to be bisexual or exclusively homosexual. The first Roman emperor to have married a man was Nero, who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions. First with one of his freedmen, Pythagoras, to whom Nero took the role of the bride, and later as a groom Nero married a young boy, who resembled one of his concubines, named Sporus.\n\nAdolescent emperor Elagabalus referred to his chariot driver, a blond slave from Caria named Hierocles, as his husband. He also married an athlete named Zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in Rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens.\n\nThese same-sex marriages continued until Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. A law in the Theodosian Code (\"C. Th.\" 9.7.3) was issued in 342 AD by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans. This law prohibited same-sex marriage in ancient Rome and ordered that those who were so married were to be executed.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, a same-sex marriage between the two men Pedro Díaz and Muño Vandilaz in the Galician municipality of Rairiz de Veiga in Spain occurred on 16 April 1061. They were married by a priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova.\n\nThe Siwa Oasis in Egypt had an historical acceptance of male homosexuality and even rituals of same-sex marriage—traditions that Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century. The German egyptologist George Steindorff explored the oasis in 1900 and reported that homosexual relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage.\n\nJames Michael McConnell, librarian, and Richard John Baker, law student on the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota, applied to the Clerk of District Court, Gerald Nelson, for a marriage license. Nelson denied the license because both applicants were men. \n\nMcConnell re-applies in a different county and receives a marriage license. Eventually, Assistant Chief Judge Gregory Anderson rules that \"The marriage is declared to be in all respects valid.\"\n\nOn a direct appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a one-sentence order stating \"The appeal [of Baker and McConnell from Hennepin County] is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\" Hennepin County had argued that the marriage license issued previously in Blue Earth County suggested that the \"Questions Raised by This Appeal Are Moot.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Established by the U.S. Air Force at the end of World War II, it was extended and consolidated during the Vietnam War (1959–1975) to the U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy and in the late 1980s to the U.S. Army. Most higher level SERE students are military aircrew and special operations personnel considered to be at high risk of capture.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force SERE School is located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, while SERE Training for the U.S. Army is located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The Navy and Marine Corps SERE School has known locations at: the U.S. Navy Remote Training Site at Warner Springs, California, the remote Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center (Bridgeport, California), and an annex of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.\n\nThe origins of what we now call SERE are rooted in the leadership of Britain's MI-9 Evasion and Escape organisation, formed in February 1939 at the onset of World WarII. Led by World WarI veteran Colonel (later Brigadier) Norman Crockatt, MI-9 were formed to train air crew and Special Forces in evading enemy troops following bail out, forced landings or becoming cut off behind enemy lines. A training school was established in London, and officers and instructors from MI-9 also began visiting operational air bases, providing local training to air crews unable to be detached from their duties to attend formal courses. MI-9 went on to devise a multitude of evasion and escape tools. Overt items to aid immediate evasion after bailing out, followed by covert items (concealed compasses, silk and tissue maps etc.) hidden in uniforms and personal items for use to aid escape following capture.\n\nOnce the United States entered the war in 1941, MI-9 travelled to Washington to discuss their now mature E&E training, devices and proven results with USAAF. As a result, the United States stood up their own Evasion and Escape organisation, known as MIS-X, based at Fort Hunt, Virginia.\n\nThere were also several unofficial private \"clubs\" created during World WarII by British and American pilots who managed to escape from and evade the Germans during the war and return to friendly lines. One such club was the \"Late Arrivals' Club\". This club, which had a \"Flying Boot\" as its identifying symbol, was strictly non-military. However, under the left collar of his uniform, the individual who had successfully escaped and/or evaded the enemy pinned the \"Flying Boot\" and although everyone knew it was not official, they did not question its being worn.\n\nUnder the direction of Air Force General Curtis LeMay it was realized that it was much cheaper and more effective to train aircrews in Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape techniques, than to have them languishing in enemy hands. He was responsible for SERE training at several bases/locations. In 1943, LeMay directed the establishment of a small program for Cold Weather Survival at RCAF Station Namao (formerly called Blatchford Field) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. (There was a USAAF B29 unit assigned there and they attended Survival Training with the British and Canadian Forces.) In 1945 it was moved to Camp Carson, Colorado, and in 1948 at Marks Air Base, Nome, Alaska. The first instructors of the consolidated school were composed of experienced wilderness \"civilian\" volunteers and USAF military personnel with prior instructor experience. This initial cadre also included \"USAF Rescuemen\" from around Alaska, Colorado, Greenland, etc. General LeMay attended the first class of instruction as a student.\n\nUltimately, the USAF consolidated at Stead AFB, Nevada. In the mid 1960s, the school was moved to Fairchild AFB, WA.\n\nThe depicted SERE patch is said to have the following symbolic significance: the color green represents freedom; the patch is halved with a yellow strip to signify that survival, evasion, resistance and escape all require caution, with the knife the basic survival tool; the severed barbed wire represents captivity but freedom regained; the Chinese character 虎 (\"hǔ\", \"tiger\") alludes to the \"Here be dragons/tigers\" legend found on early maps; finally, the black surround honors symbolically those who have died on active duty.\n\nThe curriculum has three key parts: survival and evasion; resistance and escape; and water survival. Some parts are classified.\n\nMost SERE training focuses on survival and evasion. Skills taught include Woodcraft and Wilderness Survival including Firecraft, Sheltercraft, Traps and Snares, Food & Water Procurement, Preservation and Purifying, Improvised Equipment, and also specific equipment and techniques of Rescue Sciences such as Distress signal, Navigation with and without an Escape and evasion map, Route Selection, Wilderness First Aid (a variant of the battlefield variety), techniques, methods of Evasion, and Communication Protocols, in all types of climate and terrain.\n\nTraining on how to survive and resist the enemy in the event of capture is largely based on the experiences of past U.S. prisoners of war.\n\nHow to survive in water is taught at a separate Professional Military Education (PME) course; it takes three days and is typically attended after the main SERE course. In addition to training in the use of aquatic survival gear, more academic skills include first aid tailored to an aquatic environment, communication protocols, ocean ecology, and equipment maintenance.\n\nSERE training is intended, above all, to provide students with the skills needed to live up to the U.S. military code of conduct when in uncertain or hostile environments. It is:\n\n\nSERE training takes place at three levels:\n\n\nThe US Army operates two SERE Level-C courses, one for Army aviators and one for Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF). SERE training for Army aviators is included in the Army Aviation School curriculum at Fort Rucker totaling 21 days of instruction encompassing full-spectrum training including academics and resistance labs. For ARSOF personnel, there's a 19-day SERE course, conducted by the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (SWCS), at Camp Mackall. The SWCS's SERE course focuses its training on:\n\nLevel A is taught to recruits and candidates in Officer Candidate School and the Recruit Depots, or under professional military education.\n\nLevel B at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, Bridgeport, California, and at the North Training Area, Camp Gonsalves, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.\n\nLevel C is held at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine at the Navy Remote Training Site, Rangeley, and at Naval Air Station North Island, California at the Navy Remote Training Site, Warner Springs. This installation provides \"Code of Conduct\" that is necessary for Recon Marines, Marine Corps Scout Snipers, MARSOC Marines, Navy SEALs, enlisted Navy and Marine aircrewmen, Naval Aviators, Naval Flight Officers, Naval Flight Surgeons, Navy EOD, and Navy SWCC. As the \"eyes\" and \"ears\" of the commander, they carry knowledge of sensitive battlefield information.\n\nThe training encompasses those basic skills necessary for worldwide survival, facilitating search and rescue efforts, evading capture by hostile forces. It is based on and reinforces the values expressed in the Code of Conduct while maintaining an appropriate balance of sound educational methodology and realistic/stressful training scenarios.\n\nAdditional survival training in Level C Code of Conduct may include the five-day Peacetime Detention and Hostage Survival (PDAHS) course. This training provides the skills to survive captivity by a hostile government or terrorist cell during peacetime.\n\nThe largest SERE Course is located at US Air Force Survival School at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. The US Air Force Survival School is also home to the USAF SERE Specialist program, the only career-long SERE instructor career field. Each USAF SERE Specialist goes through a grueling selection process and if successful, attends the USAF SERE Specialist Training Course. Those that graduate (less than 10%) are awarded the Sage Beret, SERE Arch and SERE Flash. Following training, the Specialists are tasked with 45 weeks of intensive on-the-job training. Each graduate must attend Airborne School at the US Army Training Center located at Ft. Benning, GA. After completion of four years as an Instructor (Field Training) the Specialist may be tasked to train students worldwide. USAF SERE Specialists are required to complete an associate degree in Survival and Rescue Sciences through the USAF Community College in order to continue to advance in their career field.\n\nSERE Specialists complete additional qualification training at specialized schools as required. Examples are Scuba Courses, Military Freefall Parachuting, Altitude chamber, etc. Assignment to each of the outlying schools requires additional training by the SERE Specialist. Upon reporting to the new assignment, each SERE Specialist must first complete that school's course (the same as an Aircrew member), and then be trained by the school's cadre in the specialized subject matter (and carry crews under supervision) before the newly assigned Specialist is \"qualified\" to teach without supervision. At Edwards AFB, USAF SERE Specialists are tasked as \"Test Parachutists\" and required to perform multiple jumps on newly introduced / modified rescue systems, aircraft, and parachuting and / or ejection systems. This includes test parachuting newly designed canopies, harnesses, etc. Currently, they are the only Test Parachutists in the Department of Defense. USAF SERE Specialists are considered DOD-wide subject matter experts in their field and are assigned to base level and command staff as advisers.\n\nLevel B SERE training in the Air Force is conducted at Lackland Air Force Base under the name Evasion and Conduct After Capture (ECAC). Student training for Level B medical aircrew was conducted at Brooks City-Base, Texas until the planned course closure on 30 September 2009. The Air Force conducts Arctic Survival Training – Cool School at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, and Parachuting and Non-Parachuting Water Survival Training at Fairchild AFB, Washington. The parachute water survival training—which was once located in Florida—ceased operations there in August 2015.\n\nSERE training was also conducted at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs from the late 1960s until 1995, enabling those USAF officers commissioned through USAFA to exempt from USAF SERE training at Fairchild AFB following undergraduate pilot or navigator training. In contrast, those USAF officers commissioned through AFROTC or OTS still had to complete SERE at Fairchild following flight training. In 1995, the resistance/escape element of the course at USAFA was abolished (see Controversies below), leaving the survival and evasion classes in a program called Combat Survival Training (CST) until 2005. In the summer 2008 some portions of the program, including resistance training, were reinstated. Following the summer of 2011, the scope of the CST program was reduced drastically and incorporated into the mandatory expeditionary skills training for budgetary reasons. Now, all USAFA graduates selected for pilot, air battle manager, or navigator training must complete SERE training at Fairchild after receiving their wings, along with their AFROTC and OTS graduate counterparts.\n\nThe SERE techniques are commonly, but erroneously, believed to be modeled on abusive Chinese \"brainwashing\" practiced on U.S. POWs during the Korean War, to extract false confessions. Instead, most SERE techniques were modeled after 1950s and early 1960s CIA interrogation and psychological warfare practices. The CIA physical and psychological methods were originally codified in the \"Kubark Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual\" published in 1963, and in CIA torture training handbooks for Latin American regimes published in the 1970s and 1980s, and were employed during the Cold War, the CIA's Phoenix Program in Vietnam, and the Chilean intelligence organization DINA's Operation Condor in South America. The other primary source for SERE techniques was 1960s CIA \"mind control experiments\", using sleep deprivation, drugs, electric shock, and isolation and extended sensory deprivation. Certain of the less physically damaging CIA methods, derived from what was at the time called \"defensive behavioral research\", were reduced and refined as training techniques for the SERE program.\n\nIn 1976, Lieutenant Wendell Richard Young, a former student, filed a $15 million suit against the Warner Spring school, after breaking his back during training. Investigating his claims, Newsweek found instances of waterboarding. A committee was also formed to interview ex-POWs and find out about torture methods used by the US military.\n\nOne of the U.S. Air Force's SERE training programs was conducted at the United States Air Force Academy from the late 1960s until 1995. Because a large number of pilots and other aircrew members graduated from the academy, it was more efficient for the Air Force to send all cadets through SERE training while they were still at the academy. Cadets would normally complete the training during the summer between their fourth-class (freshman) and third-class (sophomore) years. A number of selected second-class (junior) and first-class (senior) cadets would serve each year as SERE training cadre under the supervision of enlisted Air Force SERE instructors.\n\nAs a result of POWs' experiences during Operation Desert Storm (1990–1991), sexual assault resistance was added to the SERE curriculum. However, some of the training scenarios allegedly were taken too far by SERE cadet members at the academy during practical portions of the program. In 1995, the ABC television news program \"20/20\" reported that as many as 24 male and female cadets in 1993 had allegedly been sexually assaulted at the Academy during SERE training. One of the cadets sued the U.S. federal government, which eventually settled for a reported 3 million in damages.\n\nAs a result of the scandal, the SERE program at the Academy was reduced to the survival and evasion portions only, and the curriculum was revamped to be in line with the main course at Fairchild AFB titled: \"Combat Survival Training (CST)\". All graduates going on to aircrew positions were then required to attend the resistance portion of the training at Fairchild Air Force Base before reporting to an operational flying unit. The CST program was discontinued entirely in 2004. The Air Force Academy SERE program is running . The curriculum of the revived program will contain some resistance elements, but will not contain sexual assault resistance.\n\nIn July 2005, an article in \"The New Yorker\" magazine alleged that psychologists who help direct the SERE curriculum have been advising the military at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and other sites on interrogation techniques.\n\nThe SERE program's chief psychologist, Colonel Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for the \"behavioral science consultants\" who helped to devise Guantánamo's interrogation strategy although he has emphatically denied that he had advocated the use of counter-resistance techniques used by SERE instructors to break down detainees. \"The New Yorker\" notes that in November 2001, Banks was detailed to Afghanistan, where he spent four months at Bagram Air Base, \"supporting combat operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters\".\n\nIn June 2006, an article on \"Salon\", an online magazine, confirmed finding a document obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union through the Freedom of Information Act. A March 22, 2005, sworn statement by the former chief of the Interrogation Control Element at Guantánamo said SERE instructors taught their methods to interrogators of the prisoners in Cuba. The article also claims that physical and mental techniques used against some detainees at Abu Ghraib are similar to the ones SERE students are taught to resist.\n\nAccording to Human Rights First, the interrogation that led to the death of Iraqi Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush involved the use of techniques used in SERE training. According to the organization \"Internal FBI memos and press reports have pointed to SERE training as the basis for some of the harshest techniques authorized for use on detainees by the Pentagon in 2002 and 2003.\"\n\nOn June 17, 2008, Mark Mazzetti of \"The New York Times\" reported that the senior Pentagon lawyer Mark Schiffrin requested information in 2002 from the leaders of the Air Force's captivity-resistance program, referring to one based in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The information was later used on prisoners in military custody. In written testimony to the Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing, Col. Steven Kleinman of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency said a team of trainers whom he was leading in Iraq were asked to demonstrate SERE techniques on uncooperative prisoners. He refused, but his decision was overruled. He was quoted as saying \"When presented with the choice of getting smarter or getting tougher, we chose the latter.\" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has acknowledged that the use of the SERE program techniques to conduct interrogations in Iraq was discussed by senior White House officials in 2002 and 2003.\n\nOn December 9, 2014, the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report further confirming the use of SERE tactics in interrogations. The contractors who developed the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" received 81 million for their services, out of an original contract worth more than 180 million. NBC News identified the contractors, who were referred to in the report via pseudonyms, as Mitchell, Jessen & Associates from Spokane, Washington, which was run by two psychologists, John \"Bruce\" Jessen and James Mitchell. Jessen was a senior psychologist at the Defense Department who taught special forces on how to resist and endure torture. The report states that the contractor \"developed the list of enhanced interrogation techniques and personally conducted interrogations of some of the CIA's most significant detainees using those techniques. The contractors also evaluated whether the detainees' psychological state allowed for continued use of the techniques, even for some detainees they themselves were interrogating or had interrogated.\" Mitchell, Jessen & Associates developed a \"menu\" of 20 enhanced techniques including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and stress positions. The CIA acting general counsel, described in his book \"Company Man\", that the enhanced techniques were \"sadistic and terrifying.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was created on September 30, 1873, when International Railroad and the Houston and Great Northern Railroad merged. The railroad was officially incorporated as the International & Great Northern Railroad Company.\n\nOriginally, the I&GN operated of track from Hearne to Longview, but at its peak it owned of track. As the railroad expanded southwestwards from Hearne, it reached Rockdale in 1874 and Austin on December 28, 1876. The line extended to San Antonio in 1880 and finally to the US-Mexican border town of Laredo on December 1, 1881.\n\nThe I&GN, like other railroads of its time, had many financial troubles and went into receivership on several occasions. Jay Gould acquired control of the I&GN in December 1880. Due to his control of the Missouri Pacific (Mopac) and the Texas and Pacific Railroad, the three were operated as one system, although they each retained their separate corporate identities and seniority districts.\n\nDue to financial difficulties stemming in part from the Panic of 1907, the I-GN entered receivership in 1908 and was sold at foreclosure to a reorganized company, the International & Great Northern Railway Company on August 31, 1911. Less than four years later, the company entered receivership again, which lasted until it was sold at foreclosure in July 1922. The International-Great Northern Railroad was incorporated by the state of Texas on August 17, 1922, and fully took over operation of the International & Great Northern Railway on December 31, 1922. \n\nIn a bit of planned corporate maneuvering to keep the I-GN within the Mopac fold, the Gulf Coast Lines subsidiary, New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railway, bought the I-GN in June 30, 1924; subsequently, the Gulf Coast Lines were bought by the Missouri Pacific on January 1, 1925. Finally, on March 1, 1956, all of the GCL subsidiaries were merged into the parent Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, and the I-GN ceased its corporate existence.\n\nIn the 1960s, many of the redundant out-of-the-way lines were abandoned, including Waco to Marlin and Bryan to Navasota. The latter route was subsequently traversed via trackage rights over the Southern Pacific Railroad between the same two points. The Missouri Pacific was merged into the Union Pacific Railroad in 1997.\n\n"}

The team achieved their greatest fame in the Philadelphia professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling but has also competed in the Global Wrestling Federation and Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South.\n\nThe storyline brothers Axl and Ian Rotten first started to team as the Bad Breed in the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in 1992. On January 29, 1993 Axl and Ian defeated the Texas Mustangs (Bobby Duncum, Jr. and John Hawk aka. JBL) to win the GWF Tag Team Championship. Their run with the GWF gold did not last long as they were defeated less than a month later by The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), and they left the promotion soon after.\n\nIn October that same year the Rotten ”Brothers” made their debut for a relatively new promotion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania then known as Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW). In their debut they defeated the makeshift team of Chad Austin and Todd Shawn at \"NWA Bloodfest: Part 1\" on October 1, but lost to Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond) less than 2 hours later. The next night they main evented the show in a loss to Public Enemy in a \"Three Way Steel Cage Match\" (third team was Badd Company). A few weeks later Bad Breed unsuccessfully challenged for the ECW Tag Team Championship as they lost to champions Tony Stetson and Johnny Hotbody. Bad Breed gained a measure of revenge by defeating Stetson and Hotbody on November 12 in a non-title match.\n\nIn June 1994, Bad Breed started a feud with Public Enemy over the ECW Tag Team Title, but throughout the feud Bad Breed was never able to defeat Public Enemy for the gold. After feuding with Public Enemy the Rottens next targeted The Pitbulls, this feud led to the two teams facing off at November to Remember in a match where the losing team was forced to split up. Bad Breed lost when Pittbull #2 pinned Ian.\n\nSince the brothers both blamed each other for the loss, they began a feud against one another after teaming together for two years. The first match between the two “brothers” was at “Double Tables” on February 4, 1995 which Ian won. They next clashed in a “Hair vs Hair” match on the April 8 show \"Three Way Dance\". After being shaved bald Ian came looking for revenge at \"Hostile City Showdown\" only a week later, this time in a “Barbedwire Baseball Bat” match, but once again Axl beat his “brother”. Their final match took place at Hardcore Heaven in a Taipei Death match.\n\nAxl and Ian Rotten would reunite in 2002 where the duo won the IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship on March 2, but Axl would not be around long enough to see the team lose the belts, which forced Necro Butcher to team with Ian as they lost the titles on April 5.\n\nThe Bad Breed reunited at \"Hardcore Homecoming\" on June 10, 2005, when they took on the reunion of The Gangstinators in an \"ECW fight\" (an un-sanctioned match where there are no rules, only a fight until there is one man or team standing). On the heels of their success at \"Hardcore Homecoming\", Bad Breed once again teamed up in IWA Mid-South to win the IWA Mid-South tag team title from Vito and Sal Thomaselli, but were forced to vacate the titles when Ian suffered a concussion and had to take time off.\n\n"}

Six more Sunderlands were converted for transport use in 1943, with a further 12 following in 1944. Following the end of the Second World War, BOAC converted its Sunderlands to a less-austere standard, more suitable for peace-time operations as the \"Hythe\"-class. The primitive bench seats were removed, with seats fitted for sixteen passengers on one deck in the initial H.1 configuration, with the addition of a promenade deck giving the H.2 configuration, while the H.3 layout had an additional eight seats. of mail could be carried. Engines were standardised as the Bristol Pegasus 38.\n\nIn November 1945, Shorts flew a further refined conversion of one of BOAC's Sunderlands from their Rochester works, with revised low-drag fairings on the aircraft's nose and tail, and a refurbished interior, which was known as the Sandringham. All the Sandringhams were civil conversions of former Royal Air Force Coastal Command Short Sunderlands. The first prototype retained the Pegasus engines of the Sunderland III and Hythe, and was designated the Sandringham 1 by Shorts, but later Sandringhams, converted by Short and Harland Ltd at Belfast Harbour, were based on the Sunderland V, and were powered by Pratt & Whitney \"Twin Wasp\" engines.\n\nIn 1963 an additional conversion of a former Royal New Zealand Air Force Sunderland V was carried out by Ansett to a similar standard to the Sandringhams. The aircraft, named \"Islander\", was fitted with a 43-seat interior.\n\nThe converted Sunderlands commenced operations with BOAC on the Poole Harbour, Dorset and Lagos, Nigeria in March 1943. Following a proving flight to British India, the Sunderlands were transferred in October 1943 to flights between Poole and Karachi, via Gibraltar and Cairo. As Egypt was under military control, the aircraft were given military serial numbers and operated as part of RAF Transport Command. The service was extended to Calcutta in May 1944, while VE-Day, the end of the war in Europe, allowed the aircraft reverted to BOAC control. They continued on the India route, which was extended again to Rangoon in Burma following VJ-Day.\n\nBOAC's Hythes took on flights to Australia in 1946, starting flying the Poole–Sydney route in conjunction with Qantas on 12 May 1946. In August that year, BOAC's Hythes were also deployed on services to Hong Kong on what was known as the Dragon route.\nThe Sandringham 5 was operated by BOAC from 1947 as the \"Plymouth class\" on the Far East routes from Southampton via Alexandria to Hong Kong and Tokyo. These were replaced by Lockheed Constellation land planes during 1949. TEAL used Sandringhams on the Auckland to Sydney route and flights to Pacific Islands. In 1950, Qantas introduced the first of five aircraft which flew from the Rose Bay flying boat base on Sydney Harbour to destinations in New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Fiji, New Guinea and Lord Howe Island. Two of these were purchased from TEAL and the other three were purchased from BOAC. These were in service through to 1955.\n\nThe type was used by Ansett Flying Boat Services on the Sydney (Rose Bay) to Lord Howe Island scheduled service until 1974. One of Ansett's Sandringhams was converted from a S-25 Sunderland previously owned by the Royal New Zealand Air Force. It was also used in Norway by DNL – Norwegian Airlines 1946–1952 on the domestic service from Oslo to Tromsø, and in Uruguay by Compañía Aeronáutica Uruguaya S.A. (CAUSA) on the passenger services between Montevideo and Buenos Aires (1950–1962).\n\nIn October 1954, Captain Sir Gordon Taylor flew his newly acquired Sandringham 7 from the UK to Australia to begin a series of flying boat cruises of the south Pacific. The aircraft later passed to Réseau Aérien Interinsulaire in Tahiti and is now stored at the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace at Paris Le Bourget.\n\nOne of the last operators of the Sandringham was Antilles Air Boats in the Virgin Islands of the Caribbean which flew the aircraft in scheduled passenger service during the 1970s with flights from the Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base on St. Thomas and the Christiansted Harbor Seaplane Base on St. Croix among other destinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are the descendants of an Indo-Aryan group and have been isolated until recent times. Their total population is estimated to be 500,000. They are one of the oldest known ethnic minorities in Afghanistan.\n\nThey are mainly concentrated in the northern parts of Laghman and Nangarhar, also parts of Kunar, Kapisa, Parwan, Nuristan, and a bit of Panjshir. Some believe the Pashai are descendants of ancient Gāndhārī. Many Pashai consider themselves Pashtuns speaking a special language, and many are bilingual in Pashto. Pashai communities can also be found in the Chitral district of northwestern Pakistan.\n\nPashayis and Nuristanis were native to Kunar and Laghman valleys near Jalalabad in the north-east Afghanistan, until they were displaced to less fertile mountainous region by successive wave of immigration by Ghilzai Pashtuns. Today, the majority of Pashai are Sunni Muslims, and are often referred to as \"Kohistani\", while a minority are Nizari Ismaili Muslims. The Pashayi people originally practiced Buddhism and Ancient Hinduism, along with tribal religions.\n\nPer \"Tabakat-i-Akbari\" of Nizamuddin Ahmad, Mughal Emperor Akbar had dispatched his younger brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim, who was a staunch adherent of the missionary-minded Naqshbandi Sufi order, against the infidels of Katwar in 1582.

In the BBC film adaptation (2000), Fuchsia is portrayed by Scottish actress Neve McIntosh. \n\nFuchsia is also the subject of The Cure song \"The Drowning Man\", which is about her death and mentions her by name.\n\nFuchsia is the first child of the Earl of Groan and his Countess; but the earldom of Groan and the family seat Gormenghast can only be inherited by a son. Consequently, Fuchsia has been largely ignored by both parents; and she spends most of her time with Nannie Slagg. While Fuchsia cares for Nannie Slagg deeply, she also delights in tormenting the old woman with childish antics and pranks. When Fuchsia is about fifteen, an heir-apparent is finally born. Like many firstborns, Fuchsia is angry that her parents are having another baby and determines to hate her brother or sister. After his naming ceremony, Fuchsia expresses delight that Titus was dropped on his head. Over time, however, the two grow very close. When Titus is twelve, he is imprisoned by his mother and his schoolmaster for repeated questioning and disobedience; and Fuchsia is the only one to visit or talk to him.\n\nThe novel describes Fuchsia as \"a girl of about fifteen with long, rather wild black hair. She was gauche in movement and in a sense ugly of face, but with how small a twist might she not suddenly have become beautiful. Her sullen mouth was full and rich – her eyes smoldered\".\n\nFuchsia is a dreamer and a romantic, who escapes the dull pace of life in Gormenghast by reading fantasy tales. She frequently disappears into her secret attic rooms to fantasize and sulk. She scrawls on walls with charcoal and makes such wild claims as \"[W]hen I am Queen, I am going to burn down the castle!\", which upsets the aged Nannie Slagg. Lady Fuchsia Groan will never become Queen; but her fantasies of romance and adventure seem to keep her forever young. She responds to everything with childlike enthusiasm; and, beneath her callous and bratty exterior, she is sweet and loving. She loves her father, though she barely knows him; and, during his slow descent into madness, she often says she \"cannot bear\" to see him this way. She also has an enduring friendship with Dr. Alfred Prunesquallor, the Gormenghast physician. What Fuchsia seems to want most is someone to love her. Actress Neve McIntosh said of the character, \"She locks herself in her attic where she lives in her imagination. All she wants is a knight in shining armor to come up to the castle tower and carry her off.\" Fuchsia's favorite drink is elderberry wine.\n\nSteerpike takes advantage of Fuchsia's romantic soul by convincing the lonely young woman that he is an adventurer. Fuchsia herself is initially disgusted by Steerpike's grubby appearance, but she is then awed when he tells her of an enigmatic \"pavement in the sky\". He uses her to quickly find himself work as Dr. Prunesquallor's manservant and dispensary clerk.\n\nOver the course of the novels, Fuchsia falls in love with Steerpike. She is attracted by his swashbuckling persona and by the fact that he is different from anyone else she has ever met. It is possible that Fuchsia also loves what Steerpike represents: the possibility for change. Since Steerpike himself started out as a lowly kitchen boy and advanced upwards through the society of Gormenghast, perhaps it is also possible for Fuchsia to change her own destiny. Unbeknownst to Fuchsia, Steerpike is responsible for the death of her father, an event that saddens the young woman deeply and adds to her feeling of being utterly alone.\n\nUltimately, the pair's love affair is doomed to fail. Fuchsia finally realizes that Steerpike is \"evil\" and untrustworthy, and is frightened by his lust for power. While the television series portrays Steerpike as begging Fuchsia for shelter even after he has been revealed as a criminal (a request for assistance that she rejects), there is no corresponding scene in the novel. Fuchsia's death, in chapter 75, is precipitated by \"mounting melancholia\" brought on by the revelation that she had loved a murderer. This eventually leads her to a situation in which she finds herself standing perilously on a windowsill above the waters that had flooded the castle. Disturbed by someone knocking at the door, she slips and, knocked unconscious by her head striking the windowsill, drowns. While nothing indicates Steerpike's involvement as an immediate cause of her death (he indirectly contributed by disturbing her always fragile mental equilibrium), Titus, upon hearing of her death, immediately blames Steerpike for it (chapter 76) and swears to kill him.\n\nFuchsia was buried on Gormenghast Mountain, at a site overlooking the castle chosen by her mother, in a ceremony at which neither her brother the Earl, recovering as he was from the severe fever that followed his killing of Steerpike, nor Dr. Prunesquallor, who was caring for the Earl, could attend. It was immediately after a visit to her grave that Titus decided to abandon his hereditary responsibilities and go out into the world.\n\nIn \"Titus Alone\", Fuchsia is one of the characters from the earlier novels mocked by Cheeta in the nightmarish scene that she puts on in the Black House (chapter 105).\n"}

He became interested in the art of writing stories as a child during his primary and secondary school years. He attended the University of Puerto Rico after graduating from high school and earned his teachers certificate.\n\nIn 1920, Pedreira traveled to New York City with the intention of becoming a medical doctor and enrolled in the school of medicine of Columbia University in that city. He was exposed to the realities of racial discrimination, which was rampant in the city at that time, during his brief stay. This was one of the many factors which influenced Pedreira decision to join the Puerto Rican Nationalist movement while at the same time becoming an open advocate for Puerto Rico's independence. He dropped out of medical school because of financial problems and returned to Puerto Rico.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, he was granted a scholarship by the government and attended the University of Puerto Rico once again.

While the book was originally used along with the education project \"TeachScheme!\" (renamed ProgramByDesign), it has been adopted at many colleges and universities for teaching program design principles.\n\nAccording to HtDP, the design process starts with a careful analysis of a problem statement with the goal of extracting a rigorous description of the kinds of data that the desired program consumes and produces. The structure of these data descriptions determines the organization of the program.\n\nThen, the book carefully introduces data forms of progressively growing complexity. It starts with data of \"atomic\" forms and then progresses to \"compound\" forms, including data that can be arbitrarily large. For each kind of data definition, the book explains how to organize the program in principle, thus enabling a programmer who encounters a new form of data to still construct a program systematically.\n\nLike \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP), HtDP relies on a variant of the programming language Scheme. It includes its own programming integrated development environment (IDE), named DrRacket, which provides a series of programming languages. The first language supports only functions, atomic data, and simple structures. Each language adds expressive power to the prior one. Except for the largest teaching language, all languages for HtDP are functional programming languages.\n\nIn the 2004 paper, The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum, the authors distinguish the pedagogic focus of HtDP from that of SICP, and show how HtDP was designed as a textbook to address some problems that some students and teachers had with SICP.\n\nMany colleges and schools have used HtDP in their classes, including:\n\n\n"}

It required more powerful engines, better defensive armament, and other enhancements.\n\nThe Sunderland Mark IV used major structural elements of the Sunderland Mark III, with a fuselage stretch of 3 ft ahead of the wing, an extended and redesigned planing bottom, the same wing with thicker Duralumin skinning, and Bristol Hercules engines. Further structural changes were made after initial flight tests. The planned armament consisted of two fixed forward-firing .303 inch (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns in the nose, a Brockhouse Engineering nose turret with twin .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns, twin 20 mm Hispano cannon mounted in a Bristol B.17 dorsal turret, twin .50 in (12.7 mm) guns in a Glenn-Martin tail turret, and another .50 in (12.7 mm) machine gun in a hand-held waist position on each side of the fuselage. The turrets were all electrically powered. Two prototypes and thirty production aircraft were ordered as the Sunderland Mark IV.\n\nOn 30 August 1944, the prototype (MZ269) first flew from the River Medway at Rochester. The increased engine power caused aerodynamic stability problems, and a new fin was designed with greater height with forward dorsal extension, plus a new tailplane with increased span and area. Changes were so extensive, that the new aircraft was given the name Seaford. Thirty production aircraft were ordered, but the first of these flew in April 1945, well after the introduction of the Sunderland Mark V, and too late to see combat in Europe. The prototypes were powered by Hercules XVII engines of 1,680 hp (1,253 kW), but production aircraft used 1,720 hp (1,283 kW) Hercules XIX engines. The planned Glenn Martin tail turrets were never installed. Eight production Seafords were completed; the first (NJ200) was used for trials at MAEE Felixstowe. The second production Seaford (NJ201) was evaluated by RAF Transport Command, then in December 1945 it was loaned without armament to BOAC as G-AGWU, then returned to MAEE as NJ201 in February 1946. In April 1946, the other six production Seafords were delivered to No. 201 Squadron RAF for brief operational trials. In 1948, those six aircraft were modified as civilian airliners at Belfast, then leased to BOAC with the designation Solent 3.\n\n\nShort S.45 Seaford NJ203 displayed at Oakland Aviation Museum, Oakland, California.\n\n\n"}

Just cause has become a common standard in labor arbitration, and is included in labor union contracts as a form of job security. Typically, an employer must prove just cause before an arbitrator in order to sustain an employee's termination, suspension, or other discipline. Usually, the employer has the burden of proof in discharge cases or if the employee is in the wrong.\n\nIn the workplace, just cause is a burden of proof or standard that an employer must meet to justify discipline or discharge. Just cause usually refers to a violation of a company policy or rule. In some cases, an employee may commit an act that is not specifically addressed within the employers' policies but one of which the employer believes warrants discipline or discharge. In such instances, the employer must be confident that they can defend their decision.\n\nWhen an arbitrator looks at a discipline dispute, the arbitrator first asks whether the employee's wrongdoing has been proven by the employer, and then asks whether the method of discipline should be upheld or modified. In 1966, an arbitrator, Professor Carroll Daugherty, expanded these principles into seven tests for just cause. The concepts encompassed within his seven tests are still frequently used by arbitrators when deciding discipline cases.\n\nDaugherty's seven tests are as follows:\n\nThe last test, the degree of discipline, is important because arbitrators want to ensure that the \"punishment fits the crime.\" An employer's use of progressive discipline often gives the employer an advantage in arbitration.\n\nThe culture of the community or community standards sometimes play an important role in how just cause is defined, especially if there are issues of immorality. What is accepted in an urban and liberal community may not be accepted in a rural and religiously conservative community. The courts or arbitrator who will rule on a challenge to the discipline may be a product of those communities. Just cause can become controversial in instances when the employers personnel policies do not address a specific act but the employer believes that just cause exists. For example, if an employee is arrested and charged with a misdemeanor, the employer may deem that sufficient cause for dismissal, even if the employee is not incarcerated or is not convicted.\n\n"}

Arlington was not part of the 1914-opened Boylston Street subway; its construction was delayed by World War I and the station opened in 1921.\n\nArlington station has two side platforms serving the two tracks of the Boylston Street subway, located under the east half of the block of Boylston Street between Arlington Street and Berkeley Street. A fare mezzanine is located under the intersection of Arlington Street and Boylston Street. The mezzanine is connected to the platforms with stairs, elevators, and exit-only escalators. Five stairway entrances are located around the mezzanine; another stairway and the surface elevator are located further west on the north side of Boylston Street, connected to the mezzanine by a passageway. A closed passageway formerly led to an entrance from the Public Garden.\n\nA smaller fare mezzanine is located at Berkeley Street and connected to the platforms with a long corridor. This entrance does not have elevators for accessibility and is not open in normal use. The MBTA plans to add elevators to the Berkeley Street lobby and reopen it as a full entrance. A design contract was awarded in April 2020.\nAfter the success of the original Tremont Street subway in 1897–1898, there was a push to extend the tunnel under Boylston Street towards Kenmore Square. During 1913 tunnel excavations near the present-day site of Arlington station, remains of ancient fish weirs built by Native Americans were found approximately below street level. Their age has been estimated as between 2,000 and 3,600 years.\n\nBusinesses in the Back Bay neighborhood along Boylston Street between Clarendon and Tremont Streets became worried about loss of income due to being bypassed by an uninterrupted tunnel between Boylston and Copley stations, which was completed in 1914. They lobbied for an infill station near Arlington Street, but were rebuffed by the Boston Elevated Railway and the state legislature. In 1915, with the backing of Boston mayor James Michael Curley, they succeeded in getting legislative approval for a new underground station.\n\nAfter delays caused by World War I, Arlington station finally opened in 1921, and remained in continuous use through its first major renovation, in 1967. The Berkeley Street entrance was closed on January 3, 1981 as part of extensive cutbacks that including closing Bowdoin and Symphony.\nThe MBTA wanted to improve its graphic design in the early 1960s, so they hired Cambridge Seven Associates graphic designers to make it easier for people to understand. Arlington was used as their pilot project for testing modernization ideas, including the (T) \"lollipop\" sign, the colored walls and signage distinction between \"inbound\" vs \"outbound\", the high-contrast photographs on the walls, and the colored bands along the wall and above the entrances. At the platform level, the wall at the inbound end of the station was painted with \"warm\" colors red and orange, while the outbound end was painted with \"cool\" colors blue and green. The A dedication ceremony was held on August 17, 1968, with the renovation fully completed in 1968.\n\nOn November 22, 2006, the MBTA closed the Arlington Street entrance to the station to begin a major renovation of the station. Conducted in concert with similar changes to , the project added elevators and raised platforms to make the station accessible. The street elevator was placed in front of the Arlington Street Church along with a new set of stairs, and the nothwest entrance was relocated. The 1981-closed Berkeley Street entrance was reopened for the duration of the project.\n\nOn May 31, 2009, the renovated main entrances on Arlington Street reopened for public use; the Berkeley Street entrances were reverted to emergency-only exits. Panels of artwork were added to the station at the platform level. Designed by Ross Miller, these panels explain and celebrate the ancient Boylston Street Fishweir that had been discovered during excavations in the vicinity.\n\n"}

{"id": "2203640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203640", "title": "Shwedagon Pagoda", "text": "Shwedagon Pagoda\n\nThe Shwedagon Pagoda (, ), officially named Shwedagon Zedi Daw (, , lit. 'Golden Dagon Pagoda') and also known as the Great Dagon Pagoda and the Golden Pagoda, is a gilded stupa located in Yangon, Myanmar.\n\nThe Shwedagon is the most sacred Buddhist pagoda in Myanmar, as it is believed to contain relics of the four previous Buddhas of the present kalpa. These relics include the staff of Kakusandha, the water filter of Koṇāgamana, a piece of the robe of Kassapa, and eight strands of hair from the head of Gautama.\n\nBuilt on the high Singuttara Hill, the tall pagoda stands above sea level, and dominates the Yangon skyline. Yangon's zoning regulations, which cap the maximum height of buildings to above sea level (75% of the pagoda's sea level height), ensure the Shwedagon's prominence in the city's skyline.\n\nHistorians and archaeologists maintain that the pagoda was built by the Mon people between the 6th and 10th centuries AD. However, according to legend, the Shwedagon Pagoda was constructed more than 2,600 years ago, which would make it the oldest Buddhist stupa in the world. According to tradition, Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchant brothers from the north of Singuttara Hill in what is currently Yangon, met the Lord Gautama Buddha during his lifetime and received eight of the Buddha's hairs. The brothers returned to Burma and, with the help of the local ruler, King Okkalapa, found Singuttara Hill, where relics of other Buddhas preceding Gautama Buddha had been enshrined. When the king opened the golden casket in which the brothers had carried the hairs, incredible things happened:\n\nThe stupa fell into disrepair until the 14th century, when King Binnya U (1323–1384) rebuilt it to a height of . A century later, Queen Binnya Thau (1453–1472) raised its height to . She terraced the hill on which it stands, paved the top terrace with flagstones, and assigned land and hereditary slaves for its maintenance. Binnya Thau yielded up the throne to her son-in-law Dhammazedi in 1472, retiring to Dagon. During her last illness she had her bed placed so that she could look upon the gilded dome of the stupa. The Mon face of the Shwedagon inscription catalogues a list of repairs beginning in 1436 and finishing during Dhammazedi's reign. By the beginning of the 16th century, Shwedagon Pagoda had become the most famous Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma.\nA series of earthquakes during the following centuries caused damage. The worst damage was caused by a 1768 earthquake that brought down the top of the stupa, but King Hsinbyushin later raised it to its current height of . A new crown umbrella was donated by King Mindon Min in 1871 after the annexation of Lower Burma by the British. An earthquake of moderate intensity in October 1970 put the shaft of the crown umbrella visibly out of alignment. A scaffold was erected and extensive repairs were made.\n\nFrom 22 February 2012 to 7 March 2012, devotees celebrated the annual Shwedagon Pagoda Festival for the first time since 1988, when it was banned by the governing State Law and Order Restoration Council. Celebrations began at the Rahu corner of the pagoda's \"yinbyin\" platform, at the Maha Pahtan and Aung Myay central platforms, at 9 am. on 22 February. The Shwedagon Pagoda Festival, which is the largest pagoda festival in the country, begins during the new moon of the month of Tabaung in the traditional Burmese calendar and continues until the full moon.\n\nThe pagoda is listed on the Yangon City Heritage List.\n\nThe stupa's plinth is made of bricks covered with gold plates. Above the base are terraces that only monks and other males can access. Next is the bell-shaped part of the stupa. Above that is the turban, then the inverted almsbowl, inverted and upright lotus petals, the banana bud and then the umbrella crown. The crown is tipped with 5,448 diamonds and 2,317 rubies. Immediately before the diamond bud is a flag-shaped vane. The very top—the diamond bud—is tipped with a 76 carat (15 g) diamond.\n\nThe gold seen on the stupa is made of genuine gold plates, covering the brick structure and attached by traditional rivets. People all over the country, as well as monarchs in its history, have donated gold to the pagoda to maintain it. The practice continues to this day after being started in the 15th century by the Queen Shin Sawbu (Binnya Thau), who gave her weight in gold.\n\nThere are four entrances, each leading up a flight of steps to the platform on Singuttara Hill. A pair of giant leogryphs guards each entrance. The eastern and southern approaches have vendors selling books, good luck charms, images of the Buddha, candles, gold leaf, incense sticks, prayer flags, streamers, miniature umbrellas and flowers.\n\nIt is customary to circumnavigate Buddhist stupas in a clockwise direction. In accordance with this principle, one may begin at the eastern directional shrine, which houses a statue of Kakusandha, the first Buddha of the present kalpa. Next, at the southern directional shrine, is a statue of the second Buddha, Koṇāgamana. Next, at the western directional shrine, is that of the third Buddha, Kassapa. Finally, at the northern directional shrine, is that of the fourth Buddha, Gautama.\n\nMost Burmese people are Theravada Buddhists, and many also follow practices which originated in Hindu astrology. Burmese astrology recognizes the seven planets of astrology — the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In addition, it recognizes two other planets, Rahu and Ketu. All the Burmese names of the planets are borrowed from Hindu astrology, but the Burmese Rahu and Ketu are different from the Hindu Rahu and Ketu. The Burmese consider them to be distinct and separate planets, whereas Hindu astrology considers them to be either the Dragon's Head and Tails, or Ascending and Descending Nodes. To the Burmese people, Ketu is the king of all planets. As in many other languages, the Burmese name the seven days of their week after the seven planets, but Burmese astrology recognizes an eight-day week, with Wednesday being divided into two days; until 6 p.m. it is Wednesday, but after 6.pm. until midnight it is Rahu's day.\n\nIt is important for Burmese Buddhists to know on which day of the week they were born, as this determines their planetary post. There are eight planetary posts, as Wednesday is split in two (a.m. and p.m.). They are marked by animals that represent the day — garuda for Sunday, tiger for Monday, lion for Tuesday, tusked elephant for Wednesday morning, tuskless elephant for Wednesday afternoon, mouse for Thursday, guinea pig for Friday and nāga for Saturday. Each planetary post has a Buddha image and devotees offer flowers and prayer flags and pour water on the image with a prayer and a wish. At the base of the post behind the image is a guardian angel, and underneath the image is the animal representing that particular day. The plinth of the stupa is octagonal and also surrounded by eight small shrines (one for each planetary post). It is customary to circumnavigate Buddhist stupas in a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pilgrim, on his way up the steps of the pagoda, buys flowers, candles, coloured flags and streamers. These are to be placed at the stupa in a symbolic act of giving, which is an important aspect of Buddhist teaching. There are donation boxes located in various places around the pagoda to receive voluntary offerings which may be given to the pagoda for general purposes. As of December 2017 foreigners are charged a 10,000 Kyats (approx. US$7) entrance fee.\n\nRudyard Kipling described his 1889 visit to Shwedagon Pagoda ten years later in \"From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel\"\n\nIn 1608 the Portuguese adventurer Filipe de Brito e Nicote, known as \"Nga Zinka\" to the Burmese, plundered the Shwedagon Pagoda. His men took the 300-ton Great Bell of Dhammazedi, donated in 1485 by King Dhammazedi. De Brito's intention was to melt the bell down to make cannons, but it fell into the Bago River when he was carrying it across. To this date, it has not been recovered.\n\nTwo centuries later, the British landed on May 11, 1824 during the First Anglo-Burmese War. They immediately seized and occupied the Shwedagon Pagoda and used it as a fortress until they left two years later. There was pillaging and vandalism, and one officer's excuse for digging a tunnel into the depths of the stupa was to find out if it could be used as a gunpowder magazine. The Maha Gandha (lit. great sweet sound) Bell, a 23-ton bronze bell cast in 1779 and donated by King Singu and popularly known as the Singu Min Bell, was carried off with the intention to ship it to Kolkata. It met the same fate as the Dhammazedi Bell and fell into the river. When the British failed in their attempts to recover it, the people offered to help provided it could be restored to the stupa. The British, thinking it would be in vain, agreed, upon which divers went in to tie hundreds of bamboo poles underneath the bell and floated it to the surface. There has been much confusion over this bell and the 42-ton Tharrawaddy Min Bell donated in 1841 by Tharrawaddy Min along with 20 kg of gold plating; this massive ornate bell hangs in its pavilion in the northeast corner of the stupa. A different but less plausible version of the account of the Singu Min Bell was given by Lt. J.E. Alexander in 1827. This bell can be seen hung in another pavilion in the northwest of the pagoda platform.\n\nThe Second Anglo-Burmese War saw the British re-occupation of the Shwedagon in April 1852, only this time the stupa was to remain under their military control for 77 years, until 1929, although the people were given access to the Paya.\n\nDuring the British occupation and fortification of the Pagoda, Lord Maung Htaw Lay, the most prominent Mon-Burmese in British Burma, successfully prevented the British Army from looting of the treasures; he eventually restored the Pagoda to its former glory and status with the financial help from the British rulers. This extract is from the book “A Twentieth Century Burmese Matriarch” written by his great-great-great grand daughter Khin Thida.\n\nIn 1920, students from Burma's only university met at a pavilion on the southwest corner of the Shwedagon pagoda and planned a protest strike against the new University Act which they believed would only benefit the elite and perpetuate colonial rule. This place is now commemorated by a memorial. The result of the ensuing University Boycott was the establishment of \"national schools\" financed and run by the Burmese people; this day has been commemorated as the Burmese National Day since. During the second university students strike in history of 1936, the terraces of the Shwedagon were again where the student strikers camped out.\n\nIn 1938, oilfield workers on strike hiked all the way from the oilfields of Chauk and Yenangyaung in central Burma to Rangoon to establish a strike camp at the Shwedagon Pagoda. This strike, supported by the public as well as students and came to be known as the '1300 Revolution' after the Burmese calendar year, was broken up by the police who, in their boots whereas Burmese would remove their shoes in pagoda precincts, raided the strike camps on the pagoda.\n\nThe \"shoe question\" on the pagoda has always been a sensitive issue to the Burmese people since colonial times. The Burmese people had always removed shoes at all Buddhist pagodas. Hiram Cox, the British envoy to the Burmese Court, in 1796, observed the tradition by not visiting the pagoda rather than take off his shoes. However, after the annexation of lower Burma, European visitors as well as troops posted at the pagoda openly flouted the tradition. U Dhammaloka publicly confronted a police officer over wearing shoes at the pagoda in 1902. It was not until 1919 that the British authorities finally issued a regulation prohibiting footwear in the precincts of the pagoda. However, they put in an exception that employees of the government on official business were allowed footwear. The regulation and its exception clause moved to stir up the people and played a role in the beginnings of the nationalist movement. Today, no footwear or socks are allowed on the pagoda.\n\nIn January 1946, General Aung San addressed a mass meeting at the stupa, demanding \"independence now\" from the British with a thinly veiled threat of a general strike and uprising. Forty-two years later, on August 26, 1988, his daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi addressed another mass meeting of 500,000 people at the stupa, demanding democracy from the military regime and calling the 8888 Uprising the second struggle for independence.\n\nIn September 2007, during nationwide demonstrations against the military regime and its recently enacted price increases, protesting monks were denied access to the pagoda for several days before the government finally relented and permitted them in.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, 20,000 bhikkhus and thilashins (the largest protest in 20 years) marched at the Shwedagon Pagoda, Yangon. On Monday, 30,000 people led by 15,000 monks marched from Shwedagon Pagoda and past the offices of Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) party. Comedian Zarganar and star Kyaw Thu brought food and water to the monks. On Saturday, monks marched to greet Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest. On Sunday, about 150 nuns joined the marchers. On September 25, 2007, 2,000 monks and supporters defied threats from Myanmar's junta. They marched to Yangon streets at Shwedagon Pagoda amid army trucks and the warning of Brigadier-General Myint Maung not to violate Buddhist \"\"rules and regulations\".\"\n\nOn September 26, 2007, clashes between security forces and thousands of protesters led by Buddhist monks in Myanmar have left at least five protesters dead by Myanmar security forces, according to opposition reports, in an anticipated crackdown. Earlier in the day security authorities used tear gas, warning shots and force to break up a peaceful demonstration by scores of monks gathered around the Shwedagon Pagoda.\n\nThe web site reports that protesting \"monks were beaten and bundled into waiting army trucks,\" adding about 50 monks were arrested and taken to undisclosed locations.\nIn addition, the opposition said \"soldiers with assault rifles have sealed off sacred Buddhist monasteries ... as well as other flashpoints of anti-government protests.\"\nIt reports that the violent crackdown came as about 100 monks defied a ban by venturing into a cordoned-off area around the Shwedagon Pagoda, Myanmar's holiest Buddhist shrine.\n\nIt says that authorities ordered the crowd to disperse, but witnesses said the monks sat down and began praying, defying the military government's ban on public assembly.\nSecurity forces at the pagoda \"struck out at demonstrators\" and attacked \"several hundred other monks and supporters,\" the opposition web site detailed.\nMonks were ushered away by authorities and loaded into waiting trucks while several hundred onlookers watched, witnesses said. Some managed to escape and headed towards the Sule Pagoda, a Buddhist monument and landmark located in Yangon's city centre.\n\nUppatasanti Pagoda—located in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar—is a replica of Shwedagon Pagoda. Completed in 2009, it is similar in many aspects to Shwedagon Pagoda, but its height is less than that of Shwedagon.\n\nAnother replica of Shwedagon Pagoda, in height, was constructed at Lumbini Natural Park in Berastagi, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Completed in 2010, the construction materials for this pagoda, were imported from Myanmar.\n\nGlobal Vipassana Pagoda, high and opened in 2009, located in Mumbai, India \n\n\n\n"}

It was developed from the Short Seaford, itself a development of the Short Sunderland military flying boat design.\n\nThe first Solent flew in 1946. New Solents were used by BOAC and TEAL, production ending in 1949. Second-hand aircraft were operated until 1958 by a number of small airlines such as Aquila Airways.\n\nThe Short S.45 Solent was a high-wing monoplane flying boat of aluminium construction. Power was provided by four Bristol Hercules engines.\n\nThe aircraft could be fitted for 24 passengers with day and night accommodation or 36 day passengers. The cabins (four on the lower deck and two on the upper) could be used to sleep four or seat six. The upper deck included a lounge/dining area next to kitchen; the lower deck had two dressing rooms, toilets and three freight compartments. \nThe flight crew was five (two pilots, navigator, and radio operator with the flight engineer in a separate compartment behind the flight deck opposite crew rest berths) and there were two stewards to attend to the passengers.\n\nThe Solent 2 introduced by BOAC could carry 34 passengers and 7 crew. Between 1948 and 1950, BOAC operated their Solents on the three-times weekly scheduled service from Southampton to Johannesburg taking a route down the Nile and across East Africa. The journey took four days, including overnight stops.

The two species are:\n\nBoth species of kangaroo mouse live in sandy desert ecosystems, and forage for seeds and vegetation amongst the scrub brush of their native habitat. The dark kangaroo mouse is also known to feed occasionally on insects and carrion. The mouse rarely drinks water, instead deriving it metabolically from the foods it eats. The kangaroo mouse collects food and maintains large caches in their burrows, which are excavated to a length of between 3 and 8 feet (1 to 2.5 meters). The burrow, the entrance to which the mouse covers during daylight hours, is also used to raise litters of between 2 and 7 young. The pale kangaroo mouse burrows only in fine sand, while the dark kangaroo mouse prefers fine, gravelly soils but may also burrow in sand or sandy soil. Kangaroo mice are nocturnal, and are most active in the two hours following sunset. They are believed to hibernate during cold weather. Although mitochondrial data indicate that the clades appear to be in approximate genetic equilibrium and have not suffered any extreme bottlenecks over time, there is still concern for the survival of smaller and more vulnerable Microdipodops subpopulations due to impending habitat threats in the Great Basin Desert.\n\nThe kangaroo mice are closely related to the kangaroo rats, which belong to the same subfamily, Dipodomyinae.\n\n\n"}

Where the aqueduct crossed the lower lying areas around Wandin and approaching Mount Evelyn, it was in steel or wood-stave piping, converting to open concrete-lined channel when the higher levels were reached. It went through the township of Mount Evelyn in open channel (except for a short distance adjacent to the railway line) winding around the local contours to just above what is now Johns Crescent, then part of the 'Pine Mont Estate.'\n\nFrom this point, the aqueduct was again transferred to steel pipes to go under the Olinda Creek and Swansea Road to feed the Olinda Reservoir, in the Edinburgh Road area. This reservoir, now roofed over, was open to the skies.\n\nThe pipes crossing the Olinda Creek valley cut across the Lilydale Water Race, so water was fed from the Aqueduct to the Race, the pipe creating the Race at the Cascades was cut away, and the section of the Race upstream fell into disuse. The part of the Race downstream to the small reservoir on Birmingham Road was lined with concrete.\n\nMount Evelyn residents adjacent to the open channel were permitted to syphon water out of the channel for their own use. Those on the high side of the channel were only allowed to pump water where there was no possibility of drainage back into the open channel. One was the Pine Mont Guest House, where a windmill pumped water up to the house on top of a small hill, and the drainage went down the other side. This first aqueduct system, before later enlargement, had a capacity of 20,000,000 gallons (75 megalitres) per day.\n\nIn 1917, following a severe drought, a site in Silvan was selected across the Stoneyford Creek (a tributary of Olinda Creek) for extra water storage for Melbourne. The four components of the 'Silvan Dam' were completed by 1933, and comprised:\n\n\nThe health concerns accompanying increases in population caused the open channels to be replaced by pipes to and from the Silvan Reservoir by the late 1960s.

They could be used for trade, a hobby or DIY, and their contents vary with the craft of the owner.\n\nA toolbox could refer to several types of storage to hold tools. It could mean a small portable box that can carry a few tools to a project location or a large storage system set on casters. Modern toolboxes are predominantly metal or plastic. Wood was the material of choice for toolboxes built beginning in the early 19th century.\n\nToolboxes can be mainly divided as 5 types. They are:\n\n\nSmall portable toolboxes are sometimes called hand boxes or portable tool storage. Most portable toolboxes have one handle on top and a lid that opens on a hinge. Many have a removable tote tray that sits on a flange inside the lip of the box, with a single larger compartment below. The tote tray helps organize smaller parts and accessories. Portable toolboxes sometimes use slide-out trays or cantilever trays in lieu of the removable tote tray. Metal toolboxes (typically steel) weigh more than plastic ones. A plastic toolbox laden with tools can weigh the same as a comparable steel box does when empty. Metal boxes are also subject to rusting and their sharp edges can mark the surfaces of things they are banged against. Metal is, however, known for being stronger than plastic, so one should balance its disadvantages against the need to withstand abuse and support the weight of many tools.\nPortable chests are a type of tool storage that is small enough to carry, but has drawers to organize contents. Portable chests have a handle on top for portability and a top lid that opens on hinges. Portable chests typically have 3-4 drawers. Most are made from metal, but some have a plastic shell with metal drawers in order to help lighten the piece.\n\nA toolbox can also refer to a large tool storage system, or tool chest combos, that includes multiple pieces. These systems are almost always made from metal. Most tool storage systems are painted steel, but some are stainless steel and aluminum. They include a top chest that has drawers and a top lid that opens on a hinge. The top chest is designed to sit on a cabinet, also called a rolling cabinet (rollcab) or rollaway. The cabinet sits on four or more casters and has drawers to organize tools. Other pieces can be added to the system or combo. A middle chest, also called an intermediate chest, can be placed between the top chest and cabinet for extra storage. A side cabinet with more drawers can be hung from the side of a cabinet. A side locker can also be hung from the side of a cabinet; usually with a door that protects shelves or small drawers.\nToolcarts (also known as rollcabs) are commonly used in the transportation industry for maintenance and repair of vehicles on location. Used as portable work stations, some of the larger types are self powered and propelled, for example, pit carts in automobile racing.\n\nAfter several decades of decline in popularity, today a resurgence in use is underway. Viewed by many as intended primarily for specialized craftsmanship, such as machinists, tool and die makers, jewelers and other specialized craftsmen, they are also sought after by average tradesman and collectors as working heirloom. Many toolboxes and chests from a variety of trades can be seen at the Smithsonian Museum of American History.\n\nTool chests are primarily made of metal, though some expensive models are made of hardwoods.\n\n\n\nThe term \"toolbox\" is used in computing to represent a set of subroutines (or functions) and global variables. Typically these implement missing functionality using capabilities available in the core software.\n\n\n"}

Not all of the residents worked in the mine, some of them were prospectors in search of the gold, silver, copper and iron pyrite. During the First World War, the mine was leased to the Nichols Chemicals company for the production of sulphuric acid. After the war ended, the market fell and the mine ceased operations. Other mines soon set up operations in the area. They went by the names of The Emily, Algold, Algoma Summit and The Edward. Each mine had a town site for their employees.\n\nThe town continued to grow, with the building of a two-storey railway station, workers homes and a movie theatre. A post office was built in 1915 and closed in 1966.\n\nThe Second World War ultimately led to Goudreau's demise as the demand for gold came second to iron and steel for the war. The mines eventually closed down as costs increased.

It is centered at the intersection of the east-west and north-south portions of Highway 638.\n\nNon-native settlers began farming in the area around the time the mines of Bruce Mines closed in 1875. In November, 1889, William Moor, a farmer prospecting after the fall harvest, found ore containing gold atop a ridge overlooking what was then Lake Ickta (now Havilah Lake). After some ownership dispute, American investors organized the Ophir\nGold Mining Company (named after the biblical Ophir) to purchase the land in 1892. A small mining town was built, and gold mining operations commenced in 1893, producing 2489 tons of ore worth $8459. Operations ceased due to a financial panic in the United States and a fatal mining accident. The name of the mine and lake were changed to Havilah, another biblical reference, as mining resumed from 1910 to 1911, but the operation and its buildings were subsequently abandoned \n\nNorth of Ophir, this region was settled in the late 19th century for primarily agricultural reasons.

Moxidectin kills some of the most common internal and external parasites by selectively binding to a parasite's glutamate-gated chloride ion channels. These channels are vital to the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells; when moxidectin binds to the channels, it disrupts neurotransmission, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite.\n\nMoxidectin was approved for onchocerciasis (river-blindness) in 2018 for people over the age of 11 in the United States based on two studies. There is a need for additional trials, with long-term follow-up, to assess whether moxidectin is safe and effective for treatment of nematode infection in children and women of childbearing potential. Moxidectin is predicted to be a helpful to achieve elimination goals of this disease. \n\n\nNematodes can develop cross-resistance between moxidectin and other similar parasiticides, such as ivermectin, doramectin and abamectin.\n\nStudies of moxidectin show the side effects vary by animal and may be affected by the product's formulation, application method and dosage.\n\nAn overdose of moxidectin enhances the effect of \"gamma\"-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. In horses, overdose may lead to depression, drooping of the lower lip, tremor, lack of coordination when moving (ataxia), decreased rate of breathing (respiratory rate), stupor and coma.\n\nIf a dog licks moxidectin from the skin which was applied as a \"spot-on\" (topical) treatment, this has the same effect as an overdose, and may cause vomiting, salivation and neurological signs such as ataxia, tremor, and nystagmus. Collie dogs cannot be administered moxidectin.\n\nMoxidectin is very lipophilic, which causes it to have a high volume of distribution. Moxidectin concentrates in the animal's adipose tissue, from where it is released for up to two months following administration.\n\nIn goats, the oral bioavailability of moxidectin is 2.7 times lower, and the half-life is 1.8 times shorter than in sheep.\n\nMoxidectin, a macrocyclic lactone of the milbemycin class, is a semisynthetic derivative of nemadectin, which is a fermentation product of the bacterium \"Streptomyces cyanogriseus\" subsp. \"noncyanogenus\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, an American Cyanamid Company agronomist discovered the \"Streptomyces\" bacteria from which moxidectin is derived in a soil sample from Australia.\nTwo companies filed patents for moxidectin: Glaxo Group and the American Cyanamid Company; in 1988, all patents were transferred to American Cyanamid. In 1990, the first moxidectin product was sold in Argentina.\n\nFor human use, moxidectin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June, 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. This is the first human approval worldwide. The license holder is the nonprofit biopharmaceutical company Medicines Development for Global Health.\n"}

In 1972, the MBTA began planning a reconstruction of that section of the line, then scheduled for 1973-74. The work was eventually done in 1980, when the line was closed to modify the track and wires for the new LRVs. The line was cut back to Symphony on March 21, 1980; it was re-extended to Northeastern (using LRVs) on June 21 and Brigham Circle on September 20. \n\nThe station was originally known as Ruggles Street or Ruggles-Museum.

{"id": "2203756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203756", "title": "Jaccard index", "text": "Jaccard index\n\nThe Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient (originally given the French name \"coefficient de communauté\" by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for gauging the similarity and diversity of sample sets. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:\n\n(If \"A\" and \"B\" are both empty, define \"J\"(\"A\",\"B\") = 1.) \n\nThe Jaccard distance, which measures \"dis\"similarity between sample sets, is complementary to the Jaccard coefficient and is obtained by subtracting the Jaccard coefficient from 1, or, equivalently, by dividing the difference of the sizes of the union and the intersection of two sets by the size of the union:\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the Jaccard distance is as the ratio of the size of the symmetric difference formula_4 to the union. \nJaccard distance is commonly used to calculate an \"n\" × \"n\" matrix for clustering and multidimensional scaling of \"n\" sample sets. \n\nThis distance is a metric on the collection of all finite sets.\n\nThere is also a version of the Jaccard distance for measures, including probability measures. If formula_5 is a measure on a measurable space formula_6, then we define the Jaccard coefficient by \n\nand the Jaccard distance by \n\nCare must be taken if formula_9 or formula_10, since these formulas are not well defined in these cases.\n\nThe MinHash min-wise independent permutations locality sensitive hashing scheme may be used to efficiently compute an accurate estimate of the Jaccard similarity coefficient of pairs of sets, where each set is represented by a constant-sized signature derived from the minimum values of a hash function.\n\nGiven two objects, \"A\" and \"B\", each with \"n\" binary attributes, the Jaccard coefficient is a useful measure of the overlap that \"A\" and \"B\" share with their attributes. Each attribute of \"A\" and \"B\" can either be 0 or 1. The total number of each combination of attributes for both \"A\" and \"B\" are specified as follows:\n\nEach attribute must fall into one of these four categories, meaning that\n\nThe Jaccard similarity coefficient, \"J\", is given as\n\nThe Jaccard distance, \"d\", is given as\n\nWhen used for binary attributes, the Jaccard index is very similar to the simple matching coefficient. The main difference is that the SMC has the term formula_14 in its numerator and denominator, whereas the Jaccard index does not. Thus, the SMC counts both mutual presences (when an attribute is present in both sets) and mutual absence (when an attribute is absent in both sets) as matches and compares it to the total number of attributes in the universe, whereas the Jaccard index only counts mutual presence as matches and compares it to the number of attributes that have been chosen by at least one of the two sets. \n\nIn market basket analysis, for example, the basket of two consumers who we wish to compare might only contain a small fraction of all the available products in the store, so the SMC will usually return very high values of similarities even when the baskets bear very little resemblance, thus making the Jaccard index a more appropriate measure of similarity in that context. For example, consider a supermarket with 1000 products and two customers. The basket of the first customer contains salt and pepper and the basket of the second contains salt and sugar. In this scenario, the similarity between the two baskets as measured by the Jaccard index would be 1/3, but the similarity becomes 0.998 using the SMC.\n\nIn other contexts, where 0 and 1 carry equivalent information (symmetry), the SMC is a better measure of similarity. For example, vectors of demographic variables stored in dummy variables, such as gender, would be better compared with the SMC than with the Jaccard index since the impact of gender on similarity should be equal, independently of whether male is defined as a 0 and female as a 1 or the other way around. However, when we have symmetric dummy variables, one could replicate the behaviour of the SMC by splitting the dummies into two binary attributes (in this case, male and female), thus transforming them into asymmetric attributes, allowing the use of the Jaccard index without introducing any bias. The SMC remains, however, more computationally efficient in the case of symmetric dummy variables since it does not require adding extra dimensions.\n\nIf formula_19 and formula_20 are two vectors with all real formula_21, then their Jaccard similarity coefficient (also known then as Ruzicka similarity) is defined as\n\nand Jaccard distance (also known then as Soergel distance)\n\nWith even more generality, if formula_24 and formula_25 are two non-negative measurable functions on a measurable space formula_6 with measure formula_5, then we can define\n\nwhere formula_29 and formula_30 are pointwise operators. Then Jaccard distance is\n\nThen, for example, for two measurable sets formula_32, we have formula_33 where formula_34 and formula_35 are the characteristic functions of the corresponding set.\n\nThe weighted Jaccard similarity described above generalizes the Jaccard Index to positive vectors, where a set corresponds to a binary vector given by the indicator function, i.e. formula_36. However, it does not generalize the Jaccard Index to probability distributions, where a set corresponds to a uniform probability distribution, i.e. \n\nIt is always less if the sets differ in size. If formula_38, and formula_39 then \n\nInstead, a generalization that is continuous between probability distributions and their corresponding support sets is\n\nwhich is called the \"Probability\" Jaccard. It has the following bounds against the Weighted Jaccard on probability vectors.\n\nThe corresponding distance, formula_43, is a metric over probability distributions, and a pseudo-metric over non-negative vectors.\n\nThe Probability Jaccard Index has a geometric interpretation as the area of an intersection of simplices. Every point on a unit formula_44-simplex corresponds to a probability distribution on formula_45 elements, because the unit formula_44-simplex is the set of points in formula_45 dimensions that sum to 1. To derive the Probability Jaccard Index geometrically, represent a probability distribution as the unit simplex divided into sub simplices according to the mass of each item. If you overlay two distributions represented in this way on top of each other, and intersect the simplices corresponding to each item, the area that remains is equal to the Probability Jaccard Index of the distributions.\n\nConsider the problem of constructing random variables such that they collide with each other as much as possible. That is, if formula_48 and formula_49, we would like to construct formula_6 and formula_51 to maximize formula_52. If we look at just two distributions formula_53 in isolation, the highest formula_52 we can achieve is given by formula_55 where formula_56 is the Total Variation distance. However, suppose were weren't just concerned with maximizing that particular pair, suppose we would like to maximize the collision probability of any arbitrary pair. One could construct an infinite number of random variables one for each distribution formula_57, and seek to maximize formula_52 for all pairs formula_53. In a fairly strong sense described below, the Probability Jaccard Index is an optimal way to align these random variables.\n\nFor any sampling method formula_60 and discrete distributions formula_53, if formula_62 then for some formula_63 where formula_64 and formula_65, either formula_66 or formula_67.\n\nThat is, no sampling method can achieve more collisions than formula_68 on one pair without achieving fewer collisions than formula_68 on another pair, where the reduced pair is more similar under formula_68 than the increased pair. This theorem is true for the Jaccard Index of sets (if interpreted as uniform distributions) and the probability Jaccard, but not of the weighted Jaccard. (The theorem uses the word \"sampling method\" to describe a joint distribution over all distributions on a space, because it derives from the use of weighted minhashing algorithms that achieve this as their collision probability.)\n\nThis theorem has a visual proof on three element distributions using the simplex representation.\n\nVarious forms of functions described as Tanimoto similarity and Tanimoto distance occur in the literature and on the Internet. Most of these are synonyms for Jaccard similarity and Jaccard distance, but some are mathematically different. Many sources cite an IBM Technical Report as the seminal reference. The report is available from several libraries.\n\nIn \"A Computer Program for Classifying Plants\", published in October 1960, a method of classification based on a similarity ratio, and a derived distance function, is given. It seems that this is the most authoritative source for the meaning of the terms \"Tanimoto similarity\" and \"Tanimoto Distance\". The similarity ratio is equivalent to Jaccard similarity, but the distance function is \"not\" the same as Jaccard distance.\n\nIn that paper, a \"similarity ratio\" is given over bitmaps, where each bit of a fixed-size array represents the presence or absence of a characteristic in the plant being modelled. The definition of the ratio is the number of common bits, divided by the number of bits set (\"i.e.\" nonzero) in either sample.\n\nPresented in mathematical terms, if samples \"X\" and \"Y\" are bitmaps, formula_71 is the \"i\"th bit of \"X\", and formula_72 are bitwise \"and\", \"or\" operators respectively, then the similarity ratio formula_73 is\n\nIf each sample is modelled instead as a set of attributes, this value is equal to the Jaccard coefficient of the two sets. Jaccard is not cited in the paper, and it seems likely that the authors were not aware of it.\n\nTanimoto goes on to define a \"distance coefficient\" based on this ratio, defined for bitmaps with non-zero similarity:\n\nThis coefficient is, deliberately, not a distance metric. It is chosen to allow the possibility of two specimens, which are quite different from each other, to both be similar to a third. It is easy to construct an example which disproves the property of triangle inequality.\n\nTanimoto distance is often referred to, erroneously, as a synonym for Jaccard distance formula_76. This function is a proper distance metric. \"Tanimoto Distance\" is often stated as being a proper distance metric, probably because of its confusion with Jaccard distance.\n\nIf Jaccard or Tanimoto similarity is expressed over a bit vector, then it can be written as\n\nwhere the same calculation is expressed in terms of vector scalar product and magnitude. This representation relies on the fact that, for a bit vector (where the value of each dimension is either 0 or 1) then \n\nand \n\nThis is a potentially confusing representation, because the function as expressed over vectors is more general, unless its domain is explicitly restricted. Properties of formula_80 do not necessarily extend to formula_24. In particular, the difference function formula_82 does not preserve triangle inequality, and is not therefore a proper distance metric, whereas formula_83 is.\n\nThere is a real danger that the combination of \"Tanimoto Distance\" being defined using this formula, along with the statement \"Tanimoto Distance is a proper distance metric\" will lead to the false conclusion that the function formula_82 is in fact a distance metric over vectors or multisets in general, whereas its use in similarity search or clustering algorithms may fail to produce correct results.\n\nLipkus uses a definition of Tanimoto similarity which is equivalent to formula_24, and refers to Tanimoto distance as the function formula_82. It is, however, made clear within the paper that the context is restricted by the use of a (positive) weighting vector formula_87 such that, for any vector \"A\" being considered, formula_88 Under these circumstances, the function is a proper distance metric, and so a set of vectors governed by such a weighting vector forms a metric space under this function.\n\n\n\n"}

By the time of the 1930 United States Census, the Moore family had moved to Phoenix, Arizona where Oscar eventually began performing with his older brother Johnny, who played both trombone and guitar. The younger Moore relocated to Los Angeles, California by mid-1936. In September of the following year, he participated in his first recording session as part of the Jones Boys Sing Band for Decca Records, led and arranged by Leon René. The group attracted some local attention via radio spots and two short films for MGM directed by Buster Keaton. Sometime the same month that Oscar first recorded with the Jones Boys, he accompanied pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole in an extended engagement at Bob Lewis’s Swanee Inn, North La Brea, Hollywood. He would end up spending ten years with Cole in the piano-guitar-bass trio format that influenced Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, and countless cocktail combos throughout the jazz world. Initially the group was collective unit, but the group was re-structured after experiencing chart success with Capitol Records in the mid-1940s.

Developed in the early 1990s by Keygene, AFLP uses restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA, followed by ligation of adaptors to the sticky ends of the restriction fragments. A subset of the restriction fragments is then selected to be amplified. This selection is achieved by using primers complementary to the adaptor sequence, the restriction site sequence and a few nucleotides inside the restriction site fragments (as described in detail below). The amplified fragments are separated and visualized on denaturing on agarose gel electrophoresis , either through autoradiography or fluorescence methodologies, or via automated capillary sequencing instruments.\n\nAlthough AFLP should not be used as an acronym it is commonly referred to as \"Amplified fragment length polymorphism\", the resulting data are not scored as length polymorphisms, but instead as presence-absence polymorphisms.\n\nAFLP-PCR is a highly sensitive method for detecting polymorphisms in DNA. The technique was originally described by Vos and Zabeau in 1993. In detail, the procedure of this technique is divided into three steps:\n\n\nThe AFLP technology has the capability to detect various polymorphisms in different genomic regions simultaneously.

Although the dynastic governments of imperial China also claimed responsibility for the practice of religion, human rights bodies such as United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) have criticized this differentiation as falling short of international standards for the protection of religious freedom.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. China's five officially sanctioned religious organizations are the Buddhist Association of China, Chinese Taoist Association, Islamic Association of China, Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. These groups have been overseen and controlled by the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China since the State Administration for Religious Affairs' absorption into the United Front Work Department in 2018. Unregistered religious groups—including house churches, Falun Gong, Tibetan Buddhists, underground Catholics, and Uyghur Muslims—face varying degrees of harassment, including imprisonment, torture, and forced religious conversion to atheism.\n\nArticle 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China of 1982 specifies that:\nThis protection is extended only to what are called \"normal religious activities,\" generally understood to refer to religions that submit to state control via the State Administration for Religious Affairs. The Constitution further forbids the use of religion to \"engage in activities that disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state.\" Furthermore, it states that \"[r]eligious organizations and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign dominance.”\n\nThe law affords protection to five officially sanctioned religions: the Buddhist Association of China, Chinese Taoist Association, Islamic Association of China, Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Religious groups are required to register with the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA, formerly known as the central Religious Affairs Bureau) or its provincial and local offices (still known as Religious Affairs Bureaus (RABs)). SARA and the RABs are responsible for monitoring and judging the legitimacy of religious activity.\n\nProselytizing is only permitted in private settings or within registered houses of worship. Proselytization in public, in unregistered churches or temples, or by foreigners is prohibited. Members of the officially atheist Communist Party are strongly discouraged from holding religious faith.\n\nA significant number of non-sanctioned churches and temples exist, attended by locals and foreigners alike. Unregistered or underground churches are not officially banned, but are not permitted to openly conduct religious services. These bodies may face varying degrees of interference, harassment, and persecution by state and party organs. In some instances, unregistered religious believers and leaders have been charged with \"illegal religious activities\" or \"disrupting social stability.\" Religious believers have also been charged under article 300 of the criminal code, which forbids using heretical organizations to \"undermine the implementation of the law.\" An extrajudicial, Communist Party-led security organ called the 6-10 Office oversees the suppression of Falun Gong and, increasingly, other unregistered religious organizations.\n\nFolk religions, though not officially protected, are sometimes tolerated by authorities. The State Administration for Religious Affairs has created a department to oversee the management of folk religion.\n\nChristianity has had a presence in China dating as far back as the Tang dynasty, and accumulated a following in China with the arrival of large numbers of missionaries during the Qing dynasty. Missionaries were expelled from China in 1949 when the Communist Party came to power, and the religion was associated with Western imperialism. However, Christianity experienced a resurgence of popularity since the reforms under Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s and 1980s. By 2011, approximately 60 million Chinese citizens were estimated to be practicing Protestantism or Catholicism. The majority of these do not belong to the state-sanctioned churches. The government declared in 2018 that there are over 44 million Christians in China.\n\nReligious practices are still often tightly controlled by government authorities. Chinese children in Mainland China are permitted to be involved with officially sanctioned Christian meetings through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement or the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Associations. In early January 2018, Chinese authorities in Shanxi province demolished a church, which created a wave of fear among the Christians. \n\nChina is home to an estimated 12 million Catholics, the majority of whom worship outside the official Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA). The State Administration for Religious Affairs states that there are 5.3 million Catholics belonging to the official Catholic Patriotic Association, which oversees 70 bishops, and approximately 6,000 churches nationwide. In addition, there are roughly 40 bishops unordained by the CPA who operate unofficially, and recognize the authority of the Vatican.\n\nThe state-sanctioned church appoints its own bishops, and as with all official religious, exercises control over the doctrine and leadership of the religion. As a matter of maintaining autonomy and rejecting foreign intervention, the official church has no official contact with the Vatican, and does not recognize its authority. However, the CPA has allowed for unofficial Vatican approval of ordinations. Although the CPA continues to carry out ordinations opposed by the Holy See, the majority of CPA bishops are now recognized by both authorities. In addition to overseeing the practice of the Catholic faith, the CPA espouses politically oriented objectives as well. Liu Bainian, chairman of the CPA and the Bishops Conference of the Catholic Church in China, stated in a 2011 interview that the church needed individuals who \"love the country and love religion: politically, they should respect the Constitution, respect the law, and fervently love the socialist motherland.’’\n\nSome Catholics who recognize the authority of the Holy See choose to worship clandestinely due to the risk of harassment from authorities. Several underground Catholic bishops have been reported disappeared or imprisoned, and harassment of unregistered bishops and priests is common. There are reports of Catholic bishops and priests being forced by authorities to attend the ordination ceremonies for bishops who had not gained Vatican approval. Chinese authorities also have reportedly pressured Catholics to break communion with the Vatican by requiring them to renounce an essential belief in Roman Catholicism, the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. In other instances, however, authorities have permitted Vatican-loyal churches to carry out operations.\n\nThe Three-Self Patriotic Movement, National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China; the Three-Self Church or \"TSPM\" is the government-sanctioned (\"patriotic\") Christian organization in China. Known in combination with the China Christian Council as the lianghui, they form the only state-sanctioned (\"registered\") Protestant church in mainland China. All other Protestant denominations are illegal.\n\nChinese house churches are a religious movement of unregistered assemblies of Christians in China, which operate independently of the government-run Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) for Protestant groups and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CCPA) and the Chinese Catholic Bishops Council (CCBC) for Catholics. They are also known as the \"Underground\" Church or the \"Unofficial\" Church, although this is somewhat of a misnomer as they are collections of unrelated individual churches rather than a single unified church. They are called \"house churches\" because as they are not officially registered organizations, they cannot independently own property and hence they meet in private houses, often in secret for fear of arrest or imprisonment.\n\nChina took full control of Tibet in 1959. In the wake of the takeover and especially during the cultural revolution many monasteries were destroyed and many monks and laypeople killed. The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India and has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current Dalai Lama has attempted to negotiate with the Chinese authorities for greater autonomy and religious freedom for Tibet. As various high-ranking Lamas in the country have died, the authorities have proposed their own candidates on the religious authorities, which has led at times to rival claimants to the same position. In an effort to control this, the Chinese government passed a law in 2007 requiring a Reincarnation Application be completed and approved for all lamas wishing to reincarnate.\n\nThe present incarnation of the Panchen Lama is disputed. The Dalai Lama recognises Gedhun Choekyi Nyima; however, the Chinese government recognises Gyaincain Norbu as the incarnation of the 11th Panchen Lama. Exile Tibetan sources allege that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was kidnapped by the Chinese government. The identity of the Panchen Lama is of critical importance to Tibetan Buddhism because he is one of the authorities that must approve the next Dalai Lama.\n\nTaoist practitioners are required to register with the state-controlled Chinese Taoist Association (CTA), which exercises control over religious doctrine and personnel. Local governments restrict the construction of Taoist temples and statues, and call for abandonment of practices they deem to be \"superstitious\" or \"feudal.\" The CTA dictates the proper interpretation of Taoist doctrine, and exhorts Taoist practitioners to support the Communist Party and the state. For example, a Taoist scripture reading class held by the CTA in November 2010 required participants to ‘‘fervently love the socialist motherland [and] uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.’’\n\nThe State Administration for Religious Affairs places the number of Muslims in China at approximately 21 million, while independent estimates suggest that the number could be upwards of 50 million or more. According to a 2000 census, 96 percent of 20.3 million reported Muslims belong to three ethnic groups: Hui, Uyghur, and Kazakh. Most Hui Muslims live in Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu provinces, while Uyghur Muslims are predominantly found in Xinjiang.\n\nThe state-run Islamic Association of China (IAC) oversees the practice of Islam, though many Muslims worship outside the state system. The IAC regulates the content of sermons and the interpretation of religious scripture, exercises control over the confirmation of religious leaders, and monitors overseas pilgrimages. In 2001, the IAC established a committee to ensure that scriptures were interpreted in a manner that would serve the interests of the Chinese government and the Communist Party.\n\nAuthorities in Xinjiang impose rigid controls over religious expression, particularly over Uyghurs. Human rights reports indicate that crackdowns on religion are frequently integrated into security campaigns. Authorities monitor mosques, restrict the observation of Ramadan by government officials and students, and enact campaigns to prevent Uyghur men from wearing beards. Uyghur Muslims who worship independently have been detained and charged with conducting \"illegal religious activities.\"\n\nHowever, the suppression of the Uyghurs has more to do with the fact that they are separatists, rather than Muslims. China banned a book titled \"Xing Fengsu\" (\"Sexual Customs\") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protesters, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book. The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because the Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs. Hui Muslim protesters who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protesters were imprisoned.\n\nIn 2007, anticipating the coming \"Year of the Pig\" in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV \"to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities\". This is believed to refer to China's population of 20 million Muslims (to whom pigs are considered \"unclean\").\n\nIn response to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting, Chinese state-run media attacked Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons which insulted Muhammad, with the state-run \"Xinhua\" advocating limits on freedom of speech, while another state-run newspaper \"Global Times\" said the attack was \"payback\" for what it characterized as Western colonialism, and it also accused Charlie Hebdo of trying to incite a clash of civilizations.\n\nDifferent Muslim ethnic groups in different regions of China are treated differently by the Chinese government with regards to religious freedom. Religious freedom is present for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build Mosques, and have their children attend Mosques, while more controls are placed on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Since the 1980s, Islamic private schools have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government in Muslim areas, while only Xinjiang is specifically prevented from allowing these schools because of the separatist sentiment which exists there.\n\nAlthough religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students to embark on religious studies under the direction of an Imam. China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside Xinjiang.\n\nHui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan unlike Uyghurs who hold the same job positions, the amount of Hui who are going on Hajj is expanding, and Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them.\n\nHui religious schools are allowed to operate a massive autonomous network of mosques and schools that are run by a Hui Sufi leader, which was formed with the approval of the Chinese government even as he admitted to attending an event where Bin Laden spoke.\n\n\"The Diplomat\" reported on the fact that while Uyghur's religious activities are curtailed, Hui Muslims are granted widespread religious freedom and therefore the policy of the Chinese government towards Uyghurs in Xinjiang is not directed against Islam, but rather aggressively stamping out the Uyghur separatist threat.\n\nUyghur views vary by the oasis where they live. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs. Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and it views China more positively than does the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-Chinese oasis. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favorably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government. In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang. Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan turn a blind eye to the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children. Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca is encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party. From 1979-1989, 350 mosques were built in Turpan. Han, Hui, and the Chinese government is viewed much more positively by Uyghurs, specifically in Turpan, where the government gives them better economic, religious, and political treatment.\n\nThe Uyghur terrorist organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine \"Islamic Turkistan\" has accused the Chinese \"Muslim Brotherhood\" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining terrorist jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, with no separatist Islamist organizations operating among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the \"infidel Chinese\" language is the language of the Hui.\n\nIn Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims).\n\nThe main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars alike ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim-owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.\n\nSince the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.\n\nIn 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 30,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, Hui led by General Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until there were 135 of them left.\n\nFrom Northern Xinjiang over 7,000 Kazakhs fled to the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau region via Gansu and were wreaking massive havoc so Ma Bufang solved the problem by relegating the Kazakhs into designated pastureland in Qinghai, but Hui, Tibetans, and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash against each other.\n\nTibetans attacked and fought against the Kazakhs as they entered Tibet via Gansu and Qinghai.\n\nIn northern Tibet Kazakhs clashed with Tibetan soldiers and then the Kazakhs were sent to Ladakh.\n\nTibetan troops robbed and killed Kazakhs 400 miles east of Lhasa at Chamdo when the Kazakhs were entering Tibet.\n\nIn 1934, 1935, 1936-1938 from Qumil Eliqsan led the Kerey Kazakhs to migrate to Gansu and the amount was estimated at 18,000, and they entered Gansu and Qinghai.\n\nTibetan troops serving under the Dalai Lama murdered the American CIA agent Douglas Mackiernan and his two White Russian helpers because he was dressed as a Kazakh, their enemy.\n\nFollowing a period of meteoric growth of Falun Gong in the 1990s, the Communist Party launched a campaign to \"eradicate\" Falun Gong on 20 July 1999. The suppression is characterised by a multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor, and physical torture, sometimes resulting in death.\n\nAn extra-constitutional body called the 6-10 Office was created to lead the suppression of Falun Gong. The authorities mobilized the state media apparatus, judiciary, police, army, the education system, families and workplaces against the group. The campaign is driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio and internet. There are reports of systematic torture, illegal imprisonment, forced labor, organ harvesting and abusive psychiatric measures, with the apparent aim of forcing practitioners to recant their belief in Falun Gong.\n\nForeign observers estimate that hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in \"re-education through labor\" camps, prisons and other detention facilities for refusing to renounce the spiritual practice. Former prisoners have reported that Falun Gong practitioners consistently received \"the longest sentences and worst treatment\" in labor camps, and in some facilities Falun Gong practitioners formed the substantial majority of detainees. As of 2009 at least 2,000 Falun Gong adherents had been tortured to death in the persecution campaign, with some observers putting the number much higher.\n\nSome international observers and judicial authorities have described the campaign against Falun Gong as a genocide. In 2009, courts in Spain and Argentina indicted senior Chinese officials for genocide and crimes against humanity for their role in orchestrating the suppression of Falun Gong.\n\nIn 2006 allegations emerged that the vital organs of non-consenting Falun Gong practitioners had been used to supply China's organ tourism industry. The Kilgour-Matas report stated in 2006, \"We believe that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners\". Ethan Gutmann interviewed over 100 witnesses and alleged that about 65,000 Falun Gong prisoners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008. In 2008, two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for \"the Chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from Falun Gong practitioners\". The Chinese government has denied the allegation.\n\n\n"}

He broke through in 2001 with his international hit single \"Perdono\" and has remained commercially successful since then, in several countries. Ferro has released a Spanish version of each of his albums, and has also sung in English, Portuguese, and French. Known as the modern face of Italian pop music, he frequently writes songs for other artists and has produced albums for Giusy Ferreri, Alessandra Amoroso and Baby K.\n\nAside from his success as an artist, Ferro is well known for his personal struggles. Having been overweight as a teenager, he has been outspoken about his battles with food addiction and eating disorders. In October 2010, at the height of his fame, Ferro came out as gay, having himself struggled with depression related to self-acceptance about his homosexuality.\n\nFerro is currently one of the best-selling artists in Italy. Both his third album \"Nessuno è solo\" and fourth album \"Alla mia età\" were certified diamond. Despite his fears, his coming out did not negatively affect his career, as fifth album \"L'amore è una cosa semplice\" was the best-selling album of 2012 in Italy, and his first greatest hits album was supported by a stadium tour. As of 2015, Ferro has sold over 15 million records worldwide.\n\nFerro's interest in music was born when he received a toy keyboard as a present, which was used to compose his first songs when he was seven. He later started taking guitar and piano classes at a local conservatory of music. When he was 16 years old, he joined a gospel choir and during the same years, he started performing in piano bars and karaoke contests.\n\nIn 1997, Ferro participated in the \"Accademia della Canzone di Sanremo\", a music contest created with the purpose to choose the contestants of the Sanremo Music Festival, but was eliminated during the first stage of the competition. The following year, Ferro participated again in the same contest, and despite being chosen as one of the 12 finalists, he did not make it to win the competition. However, during the selections, Ferro met music producers Alberto Salerno and Mara Maionchi, and started to collaborate with them.\n\nIn 1999 Ferro also toured throughout Italy as a back vocalist with the Italian hip hop band Sottotono.\n\nIn 2001, Ferro signed a contract with EMI Music Italy. On 22 June 2001, he released his first single, \"Xdono\". During the first months after the release, the song received a poor reception, but it later became a hit and, after topping the Italian Singles Chart in September 2001, it was certified double platinum by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry for sales exceeding 100,000 copies.\n\nThe song was included in Ferro's debut album, \"Rosso Relativo\", released on 26 October 2001. Following the commercial success obtained in Italy, in 2002 the album was released in several European countries. A Spanish-language version of the record, titled \"Rojo Relativo\", was also released in Spain and Latin America. \"Rosso Relativo\" obtained success in different markets throughout its various editions and had sold more than 1,000,000 copies worldwide by 2004, according to EMI Music. The album also allowed Ferro to receive a nomination for Best New Artist at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2003.\n\nIn November 2003, Ferro released his second studio album, \"111\", recorded both in Italian and Spanish, produced by Alberto Salerno, Mara Maionchi and Michele Canova. The album was preceded by the release of \"Xverso\" / \"Perverso\", and also spawned the singles \"Sere nere\" / \"Tardes negras\", \"Non me lo so spiegare\" / \"No me lo puedo explicar\" and \"Ti voglio bene\" / \"Desde mañana no lo sé\". \"111\" has sold more than 1,000,000 copies worldwide, topping the Mexican Albums Chart and being certified four times platinum in Italy for domestic sales exceeding 450,000 copies. Following the success of the album Ferro won Best Italian Artist at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\n\nIn July 2004, Ferro also released in Europe his first English-language single, \"Universal Prayer\", a duet with British R&B singer Jamelia recorded to promote the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nFerro lived in Mexico during these years, first in Cuernavaca and later in Puebla. He studied Spanish there at a university, eventually graduating in August 2005, before relocating to Manchester.\n\nFerro's third studio album, \"Nessuno è solo\" / \"Nadie está solo\", was released in June 2006, following the lead single \"Stop! Dimentica\", which became a number-one hit in Italy and Austria. The album, described by music critics as more intimate and melancholic, obtained in Italy a success even bigger than his previous ones, reaching the diamond certification for its domestic sales. The third single from the album, \"Ti scatterò una foto\", was included in the soundtrack of the movie \"Ho voglia di te\", directed by Luis Prieto and based on the book with the same title by Federico Moccia. \"Nessuno è solo\" also features a duet with Italian pop singer-songwriter Biagio Antonacci, while the Spanish-language version of the album includes \"Mi credo\", a song recorded with Pepe Aguilar.\n\nIn June 2008 Ferro co-wrote with Roberto Casalino the single \"Non ti scordar mai di me\" for \"X Factor Italy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first edition's runner-up Giusy Ferreri. The song became a huge success in Italy, topping the Italian Singles Chart for 12 non-consecutive weeks. Ferro also produced Giusy Ferreri's debut album, \"Gaetana\", containing 6 songs penned by him, including \"L'amore e basta!\", a duet between Ferro and Ferreri.\n\nOn 7 November 2008 Ferro released his fourth studio album, \"Alla mia età\" / \"A mi edad\", preceded by the single with the same title. \"Alla mia età\" debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and became the best-selling album of 2009 in Italy, also achieving his second diamond certification. The album contains a duet with singer-songwriter Franco Battiato, and \"Breathe Gentle\", the English version of third single \"Indietro\", features Kelly Rowland. Other collaborators to the project included Italian songstress Laura Pausini, Anahí and Dulce María of Mexican pop group RBD and Amaia Montero.\n\nIn November 2009, Ferro released his first video album, \"Alla mia età – Live in Rome\", recorded during his concerts at the \"Stadio Olimpico\" on 24 and 25 June 2009. A few months later, Ferro was chosen to record the Italian version of Mary J. Blige's single \"Each Tear\", included in her album \"Stronger with Each Tear\" The song reached the top spot on the Italian Singles Chart.\n\nIn October 2011 Ferro released \"La differenza tra me e te\", the lead single from his fifth studio album \"L'amore è una cosa semplice\" (titled \"El amor es una cosa simple\" in Spanish). The album was released on 28 November 2011 and spent five weeks on top of the Italian Albums Chart. All seven singles were certified gold or higher in the country. The album itself was certified eight times platinum and became the best-selling album of 2012.\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2012, Ferro embarked on a largely domestic concert tour, with additional stops in Switzerland, Belgium and Monaco. The tour's highlight was Ferro's first full stadium concert at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. This sold-out concert was attended by 50,000 fans.\n\nIn 2013 Ferro opted to focus on collaborating with other artists. Italian female hip hop artist Baby K released her debut album \"Una seria\" in March, which was produced by Ferro together with Michele Canova. Ferro featured on first single \"Killer\", which peaked at No. 10 on the Italian Singles Chart and was certified platinum. He also featured on the album's third single, \"Sei sola\". In September Alessandra Amoroso released \"Amore puro\", another album produced by Ferro and Canova. This album achieved a double platinum certification. Four of its five singles were written by Ferro.\n\nFerro released his first greatest hits album \"TZN - The Best of Tiziano Ferro\" in November 2014. Both the lead single \"Senza scappare mai più\" and the second single \"Incanto\" reached the top five in Italy and were certified platinum. The album itself spent six non-consecutive weeks at number one, the last of which came after his acclaimed guest performance at the Sanremo Music Festival. It was eventually certified seven times platinum and spent almost a year in the top ten on the Italian album chart. In Spain, it was Ferro's first top ten album in more than ten years.\n\nIn the summer of 2015 Ferro toured the main Italian stadiums, including two concerts at the San Siro stadium in Milan and two at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. The Milan concerts were recorded and added to a new CD/DVD edition of \"TZN - The Best of Tiziano Ferro\", that was released in November 2015. That same month Ferro started a European arena tour to continue promoting the greatest hits compilation.\n\nFerro announced the release date of his sixth studio album a year in advance, at the last concert of his European arena tour. He told the crowd that it would be released on 2 December 2016. In June the album's title was revealed to be Il mestiere della vita. The album's lead single \"Potremmo ritornare\" was released in October and debuted on top of the Italian Singles Chart. It was his first number-one hit as lead artist since 2008's \"Alla mia età\".\n\nAmong the collaborators include Baby K, Raige, Emanuele Dabbono, Tormento and Carmen Consoli, the latter collaboration Ferro and Consoli sang together in the second single Il conforto, extracted on January 13, 2017. The song reached the 4th position in the Italian Singles Chart.\n\nComposed of 13 tracks, the album features pop, rap and R&B sounds, with themes ranging from forgiveness to fear and anger.\n\nFrom June to July 2017 the tour \"Il mestiere della vita Tour 2017\" was held, consisting of thirteen dates in Italian stadiums. In April 2018 the singer-songwriter won an Onstage Award for the best Italian tour.\n\nIn contrast to his flourishing professional life, Ferro's personal life was marked by ever increasing despondency. Convinced that he would have to give up his singing career if the truth about his sexuality were ever revealed, he kept family and friends at a distance, living alone in England. He was diagnosed with depression in 2008 and started taking antidepressants. In late 2009, he came close to taking his own life, going as far as to write a suicide note. In early 2010 his desperation led him to break down and come out to his father, an event that inspired the title of his first book, \"Trent'anni e una chiacchierata con papà\" (Thirty years old and a chat with dad). This book, published in October 2010, contains most of his personal diaries, dutifully kept since his teenage years. Its release was preceded by an interview with Vanity Fair in which he declared his homosexuality to the public. The following year Ferro moved back to Italy to live closer to his friends and family.\n\nIn 2019, Ferro announced his marriage to former Warner Bros. consultant Victor Allen. The two were married in Sabaudia, a comune of the Latina province in Latium. In a statement made to the Corriere, he confirmed that he considers himself both \"gay and Catholic\".\n\n\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2013 \n\n"}
{"id": "2203809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203809", "title": "Bowdoin station", "text": "Bowdoin station\n\nBowdoin () is a rapid transit station in Boston, Massachusetts. It serves the MBTA Blue Line. It is located in Bowdoin Square in the Beacon Hill neighborhood. It is the downtown terminus of the line (though Government Center served this role during nights and weekends from 1982 to 2014).\n\nBowdoin station is the only heavy rail station on the MBTA subway system that is not accessible.\n\nThe East Boston Tunnel was opened to streetcar service as far as Court Street on December 30, 1904. Court Street proved to be a problematic terminus; its single-track design limited frequent service, and also resulted in crashes. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) began an extension towards Beacon Hill in 1912. The extension opened to Bowdoin with an intermediate stop at Scollay Under on March 18, 1916.\n\nBowdoin was built with an unusual wedge-shaped island platform inside a balloon loop, which eliminated the awkward end-changing required at Court Street and allowed use of unpowered trailer cars in the tunnel to increase capacity. A pair of tracks continued past the loop, out the Joy Street Portal, and down Cambridge Street, allowing for one route to provide through streetcar service from East Boston to Cambridge rather than looping at Bowdoin.\n\nOver the weekend of April 18 to 21, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted from streetcar use to high-floor rapid transit operation. Rather than modify the tunnel, the BERy elected to build smaller-than-usual rapid transit cars which could operate in a tunnel designed for streetcars—particularly around the tight loop at Bowdoin. Blue Line cars are thus long, substantially shorter than the Orange Line cars and the Red Line cars. Bowdoin is the only remaining loop in regular service on the MBTA's heavy rail lines, though Red Line trains can loop around Codman Yard past Ashmont station if necessary.\n\nBecause the line did not have a dedicated maintenance facility, trains used the Joy Street Portal to reach surface tracks on the Longfellow Bridge, which connected to the Cambridge Tunnel and the Eliot Shops near Harvard Square. When the first phase of the Revere Extension opened to Orient Heights with a new facility in 1952, the connection was no longer necessary and the portal was filled. The tail tracks past the Bowdoin loop are still used for train storage during the winter, however.\n\nThe station was modernized in 1968 as part of a $9 million systemwide station improvement program. The original headhouse was replaced with a glassy entrance under a tilted concrete slab, set into a shallow depression to reduce the costs of installing the escalator. The new headhouse was designed by Josep Lluís Sert as part of a project for a never-built Catholic chapel nearby.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the MBTA suffered from a serious budget crisis, which resulted in service cuts. MBTA Commuter Rail service to Providence and Concord and on the Woburn Branch were cut entirely, five underused commuter rail stations were closed, Boylston and Essex were closed for short periods, and the outer ends of the Orange and Blue lines were bustituted on Sundays. Bowdoin, with low ridership and in close proximity to Government Center, was closed on January 3, 1981 due to budget cuts. It reopened on January 11, 1982, but only on weekdays until 6:30 pm - intended to serve workers in nearby office and government buildings. Bowdoin was briefly closed again from March 3 to April 20, 1982, and reopened again with limited hours, with Government Center serving as the terminus on nights and weekends (though trains continued to loop at Bowdoin).\n\nThe station was closed from July 29 to September 8, 1992, during track work on the loop. As the MBTA planned the Blue Line Modernization Project in the early 1990s, the agency planned to close Bowdoin in order to eliminate the tight loop. The closure would take place after the renovation of Government Center, which would re-add a long-closed entrance at the west end of the Blue Line platform. In 2008, the MBTA began running six-car trains on the Blue Line. Because the eastbound side of the Bowdoin platform can only fit four cars, the trains have pushbuttons to allow passengers at Bowdoin to open the doors from the platform.\n\nUntil at least 2011, the MBTA still planned to close the station after Government Center was renovated. However, by 2013, the MBTA decided not to construct the planned west entrance at Government Center, and to instead build only a less-expensive emergency exit. On December 28, 2013, the MBTA resumed night and weekend service to Bowdoin station. The change was intended to provide alternative transportation during the three-month closure of the Callahan Tunnel and subsequent two-year closure of Government Center station. This was the first time since 1981 that the station was open during all operating hours. In February 2016, the MBTA announced that Bowdoin would remain open at all times even after Government Center reopened on March 21.\n\n"}
{"id": "2203813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203813", "title": "Richmond station (California)", "text": "Richmond station (California)\n\nThe Richmond Transit Center is a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Amtrak station located in Richmond, California. Richmond is the north terminus of BART service on the Richmond–Warm Springs/South Fremont line and Richmond–Daly City/Millbrae line; it is a stop for Amtrak's \"Capitol Corridor\", \"San Joaquin\", and \"California Zephyr\" routes. It is one of two transfer points between BART and Amtrak, along with Oakland Coliseum station.\n\nThe Southern Pacific-controlled Northern Railway opened through what is now Richmond in 1878, but a station was not established until the arrival of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1900. The station was closed upon the formation of Amtrak in 1971. Two years later, Richmond became one of the termini of the initial BART system. Amtrak service began in 1978, with a shelter constructed in 1984. A new Amtrak platform was built in 2001, followed by a renovation of the whole station completed in 2007.\n\nThe Southern Pacific-controlled Northern Railway opened through the then-uninhabited swamplands near Point Richmond on January 8, 1878. A stop was soon established at San Pablo, north of what is now Richmond. Passenger service to Richmond started around 1900 when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) made Port Richmond the west terminus of its transcontinental mainline, where passengers could board ferries to San Francisco. By 1910, the rapidly growing town of Richmond had four train stations: the Southern Pacific (SP) stopped in downtown Richmond near MacDonald Avenue and at Stege south of Potrero Avenue; the was at the west end of MacDonald Avenue.\n\nEven as intercity rail service began to decline, Richmond was served by SP trains on the Shasta Route, Overland Route, and Central Valley routes, plus ATSF service to the Central Valley. ATSF service ended in 1968 when the \"Golden Gate\" was discontinued. SP service to Richmond on the \"San Joaquin Daylight\" continued until May 1, 1971, when Amtrak took over intercity passenger service.\n\nAs early as 1957, Richmond was identified as a likely terminus for a line of a proposed regional rapid transit system. The system was approved by voters in November 1962. The station was originally to be located at 6th and MacDonald west of downtown, but this was changed to 16th and Nevin (along the SP line) to allow construction of a storage yard north of the station and permit future extension. After tension between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District and the city, an agreement to use the latter site was reached in May 1967. BART service to Richmond began on January 29, 1973; it has remained a terminus since. An extension to Crockett was considered in 1991 but not pursued.\n\nA \"rather disquieting\" mosaic relief by William Mitchell, made of seashells and fiberglass, is located near the BART faregates.\nUnlike other large cities, the Bay Area did not have a convenient transfer location between Amtrak intercity service and local rapid transit; Oakland Central Station was not located near a BART stop. The introduction of the \"San Joaquin\" service in 1974 added a third round trip to the SP mainline north of Oakland. The \"San Joaquin\" plus the long-distance \"San Francisco Zephyr\" and \"Coast Starlight\" began stopping at a small side platform near the BART station in late 1977 or early 1978. A station building with an elevator to the BART pedestrian access was built in 1984. Service gradually expanded; a second \"San Joaquin\" was added in 1980, and the \"Capitols\" service began in 1991. The \"Coast Starlight\" ceased to stop at Richmond in April 1996, followed by the \"California Zephyr\" (successor to the \"San Francisco Zephyr\") in October 1998.\n\nThe Amtrak station building was closed on December 1, 1997, though trains continued to stop. On April 12, 2000, BART and the city broke ground on a \"transit village\", a large mixed-use transit-oriented development adjacent to the station. In July 2001, the aging Amtrak facility was replaced with a modern island platform with better access to the BART pedestrian tunnel. The $1.9 million project, funded by the state, was intended to improve the station as preparation for the transit village. The developer for the transit village - which included an 800-space garage for BART - was chosen in 2002.\n\nA $6.4 million renovation of the station was undergone as part of the transit village project. An \"industrial post-modern\" circular canopy was built over the station entrance. The station was officially named the Richmond Transit Center at a dedication ceremony on October 18, 2007. A BART ticket window opened at the station in August 2008, joining seven other major stations in the system. The two intercity trains began stopping at Richmond again on November 8, 2010. However, the \"Coast Starlight\" stop was again discontinued on January 14, 2013 because the train was scheduled to arrive at night - if it was several hours late, passengers would be unable to exit through the locked BART tunnel. In 2018, BART and CCJPA installed a \"courtesy light\" on the Amtrak platform, which will instruct eastbound \"Capitol Corridor\" trains to hold for two minutes if a BART train is arriving to allow passengers to make their connection.\n\nThe BART station - a single island platform with two tracks - is located on the east side of the station complex. The Amtrak station - an island platform served by two of the three tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad Martinez Subdivision - is located to its west. An under-track pedestrian tunnel connects the two platforms with entrances on both sides of the tracks. The east side has a BART parking lot; the transit village, bus bays, and parking garage are located near the large canopy on the west side.\n\nAlthough Richmond is a terminal station for BART, most connecting regional bus services instead run to El Cerrito del Norte station, which is much closer to I-80. Richmond is served by several local bus services:\n\nA Golden Gate Transit route over the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge connecting Richmond to the agency's main service area in North Bay ran until 2015, when it was combined with a route that terminates at El Cerrito del Norte station.\n\nRichmond station is also served by Flixbus intercity buses.\n\n\n"}

Prior to this, it was misclassified as \"Toxoplasma gondii\" due to structural similarities. The genome sequence of \"Neospora caninum\" has been determined by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the University of Liverpool. \"Neospora caninum\" is an important cause of spontaneous abortion in infected livestock.\n\n\"Neospora caninum\" has a heteroxenous life cycle, with the sexually reproductive stage occurring in the intestine of a definitive host. Until recently, the only known definitive host was the domestic dog. New research has determined that other canids such as coyotes (\"Canis latrans\"), gray wolves (\"Canis lupus\"), and Australian dingos (\"Canis lupus dingo\") are also definitive hosts.\n\nOocysts passed in the feces of the definitive host, such as canines or canids, are ingested by an intermediate host, such as cattle. After ingestion of an oocyst, motile and rapidly dividing tachyzoites are released. These tachyzoites disseminate throughout the host, and in response to the host immune response, differentiate into bradyzoites, which form cysts in muscle and tissue. Formation of these cysts results in chronic infection of the intermediate host. Ingestion of infected intermediate host tissue by the definitive host completes the life cycle. A second route of transmission is the congenital transmission from mother to offspring. Transplacental transmission (passage from mother to offspring during pregnancy) has also been shown to occur in dogs, cats, sheep and cattle. If the intermediate host acquires the disease during pregnancy, it activates these cysts, and active infection often causes spontaneous abortion. In addition, if the aborted fetus and membranes are then eaten by the definitive host, they cause further infection and the cycle is complete. Other carnivores, for example the red fox (\"Vulpes vulpes\"), may also be intermediate hosts, but they are not known to be definitive hosts. \"Neospora caninum\" does not appear to be infectious to humans. In dogs, \"Neospora caninum\" can cause neurological signs, especially in congenitally infected puppies, where it can form cysts in the central nervous system.\n\nThe discovery that coyotes are definitive hosts may increase the risk of transmission of \"N. caninum\" to domestic livestock as well as to wild ruminants such as white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\"). Coyote range now includes most of North and Central America. Studies suggest that the parasite may be widespread among wildlife and that infection cycles cross over between wild and domestic animals.\n\nRecent studies have broadened the list of known intermediate hosts to include birds. \"N. caninum\" has recently been found to infect domestic chickens and house sparrows (\"Passer domesticus\") which may become infected after ingesting parasite oocysts from the soil. Sparrows, which are common in urban and rural areas, may serve as a food source for wild and domestic carnivores. \"N. caninum\" has also been detected in common buzzards (\"Buteo buteo\") and magpies. The presence of birds in cattle pastures has been correlated to higher infection rates in cattle. Birds may be an important link in the transmission of \"N. caninum\" to other animals.\n\nNeosporosis is an infectious disease for many different canids and cattle. Neuromuscular degeneration was first observed in canines in Norway, which led to hind limb paralysis. Abortion in dairy cattle was also observed as a major cause of disease by neosporosis. Although this disease is worldwide, it is of major concern in the United States, Netherlands, and New Zealand.\n\n\"N. caninum\" infections have been reported from most parts of the world with studies in the United States, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Estonia, Germany, and Portugal. 12-45% of aborted fetuses from dairy cattle are infected with the organism. Exposure is common in US dairy herds, ranging from 16% to 36% of dairy cows testing positive on serum. The majority of calves that acquire a \"Neospora\" infection during gestation are born clinically normal except that they have precolostral antibody titers to \"Neospora caninum\".\n\nIn addition to being an important cause of cattle abortions, neosporosis is a significant disease in dogs throughout the world. If the disease is caught early, dogs may be successfully treated with clindamycin and other antiprotozoan drugs. However, the disease is often fatal to young puppies. Preventative vaccines have been tested on cattle. An inactivated vaccine was made commercially available but had mixed results. A live vaccine using attenuated \"N. caninum\" tachyzoites has been more successful but is expensive to produce. Other treatment options aim at prevention of the disease. Prevention requires an understanding of the transmission cycle, especially the connection between cattle and dogs (canids). Canids may pick up the parasite from eating infected material and spread the disease through contaminated feces. One control method is to test for the disease and remove infected cattle from the herd. Another method of control is preventing canids from entering the cattle holding area.\n\nFrom the \"neo\"- (Latin, \"new\") + \"spora\" (Greek, \"seed\") and \"canis\" (Latin, \"dog\"), \"Neospora caninum\" is a sporozoan parasite that was first described in 1984.\n\n"}

It consists of a set of twenty-five variations and a concluding fugue, all based on a theme from George Frideric Handel's Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B major, HWV 434. They are known as his Handel Variations.\n\nThe music writer Donald Tovey has ranked it among \"the half-dozen greatest sets of variations ever written\". Biographer Jan Swafford describes the \"Handel Variations\" as \"perhaps the finest set of piano variations since Beethoven\", adding, \"Besides a masterful unfolding of ideas concluding with an exuberant fugue with a finish designed to bring down the house, the work is quintessentially Brahms in other ways: the filler of traditional forms with fresh energy and imagination; the historical eclectic able to start off with a gallant little tune of Handel's, Baroque ornaments and all, and integrate it seamlessly into his own voice, in a work of massive scope and dazzling variety.\"\n\nThe \"Handel Variations\" were written in September 1861 after Brahms, aged 28, abandoned the work he had been doing as director of the Hamburg women's choir (\"Frauenchor\") and moved out of his family's cramped and shabby apartments in Hamburg to his own apartment in the quiet suburb of Hamm, initiating a highly productive period that produced \"a series of early masterworks\". Written in a single stretch in September 1861, the work is dedicated to a \"beloved friend\", Clara Schumann, widow of Robert Schumann. It was presented to her on her 42nd birthday, September 13. At about the same time, his interest in, and mastery of, the piano also shows in his writing two important piano quartets, in G minor and A major. Barely two months later, in November 1861, he produced his second set of \"Schumann Variations\", Op. 23, for piano four hands.\n\nFrom his earliest years as a composer, the variation was a musical form of great interest to Brahms. Before the \"Handel Variations\" he had written a number of other sets of variations, as well as using variations in the slow movement of his Op. 1, the Piano Sonata in C major, and in other chamber works. As he appeared on the scene, variations were in decline, \"little more than a basis for writing paraphrases of favorite tunes\". In Brahms's work the form once again became restored to greatness.\n\nBrahms had been emulating Baroque models for six years or more. In particular, between the time he wrote his previous \"Two Sets of Variations for piano\", (No. 1, \"Eleven Variations on an Original Theme, in D major (1857)\" and No. 2, \"Fourteen Variations on a Hungarian Melody, in D major (1854)\"), Op. 21, and the \"Handel Variations\", Op. 24, Brahms did a careful study of \"more rigorous, complex and historical models, among others preludes, fugues, canons and the then obscure dance movements of the Baroque period. Two gigues and two sarabandes that Brahms wrote to develop his technique are extant today. The results of these historical studies are seen in his choice of Handel for the theme, as well as his use of Baroque forms, including the Siciliana dance form (Var. 19) from the French school of Couperin and, in general, the frequent use of contrapuntal techniques in many variations.\n\nOne aspect of his approach to variation writing is made explicit in a number of letters. \"In a theme for a [set of] variations, it is almost only the bass that has any meaning for me. But this is sacred to me, it is the firm foundation on which I then build my stories. What I do with a melody is only playing around ... If I vary only the melody, then I cannot easily be more than clever or graceful, or, indeed, [if] full of feeling, deepen a pretty thought. On the given bass, I invent something actually new, I discover new melodies in it, I create.\" The role of the bass is critical.\n\nIdentifying the bass as the essence of the theme, ...Brahms advocated using it to control the structure and character of individual variations and of the entire set. But by this he apparently did not mean retaining in the variations the bass line of the theme or even its harmonies ... To invent something actually new and to discover new melodies in the bass give the bass a role at once passive and active. While maintaining the structure of the theme—the passive bass, so to speak—Brahms may actively create melodies and figurative patterns (including melodies \"discovered in\" the bass), project different contrapuntal textures, and draw on an expanded harmonic vocabulary, sometimes interpreting the melody as the bass of the harmony or regarding major and minor or sharp and flat versions of the same passage as equally valid and available. The result is a great diversity of expression and character founded on a relatively strict conception of the \"given\" material.\n\nBrahms also took into careful account the character of the theme, and its historical context. Unlike the great model of Beethoven's Diabelli Variations, where the variations departed widely from the character of the theme, Brahms's variations expressed and developed the character of the theme. Because the theme for the Handel variations originated in the Baroque era, Brahms included forms such as a siciliana, a musette, a canon and a fugue.\n\nStill not fully established in his career in 1861, Brahms had to struggle to get the work published. He wrote to Breitkopf & Härtel, \"I am unwilling, at the first hurdle, to give up my desire to see this, my favourite work, published by you. If therefore, it is primarily the high fee that stops you taking it, I will be happy to let you have it for 12 Friedrichsdors or, if this still seems too high, 10 Friedrichsdors. I very much hope you will not think I plucked the initial fee arbitrarily out of the air. I consider this work to be much better than my earlier ones; I think it is also much better adapted to the demands of performance and will therefore be easier to market ...\"\n\nThe theme of the \"Handel Variations\" is taken from an aria in the third movement of Handel's Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B Major, HWV 434 (\"Suites de pièces pour le clavecin,\" published by J. Walsh, London 1733 with five variations). Brahms himself owned a copy of the 1733 First Edition. The appeal of the aria for Brahms might have been its simplicity: its range is restricted to one octave; the harmony is plain, with every note taken from the B-flat major scale; it \"made an admirably neutral starting-place\". While Handel had written only five variations on his theme, Brahms, with the piano as his instrument rather than the more limited harpsichord, enlarged the scope of his opus to 25 variations ending with an extended fugue. Brahms's use of Handel exemplifies his love of the music of the past and his tendency to incorporate it and transform it in his own compositions.\n\nOf the overall concept of the work, Malcolm MacDonald writes \"Some of Brahms's models in this monumental work are easy enough to identify. In the scale and ambition of his conception both Bach's 'Goldberg' and Beethoven's 'Diabelli Variations' must have exercised a powerful if generalized influence; in specific features of form Beethoven's 'Eroica' Variations is a closer parallel. But the overall structure is original to Brahms.\" And MacDonald suggests what might have been a more contemporary source of inspiration, the \"Variations on a Theme of Handel, Op. 26\", by Robert Volkmann. \"Brahms might well have known that large and often admirable work, published as recently as 1856, which Volkmann based on the so-called 'Harmonious Blacksmith' theme from the Air with Variations in Handel's E major Harpsichord Suite.\"\n\nIn \"Music, Imagination, and Culture\" Nicholas Cook gives the following concise description:\n\"The Handel Variations consist of a theme and twenty-five variations, each of equal length, plus a much longer fugue at the end which provides the climax of the movement in terms of duration, dynamics, and contrapuntal complexity. The individual variations are grouped in such a way as to create a series of waves, both in terms of tempo and dynamics, leading to the final fugue, and superimposed on this overall organization are a number of subordinate patterns. Variations in tonic major and minor more or less alternate with each other; only once is there a variation in another key (the twenty-first, which is in the relative minor). Legato variations are usually succeeded by staccato ones; variations whose texture is fragmentary are in general followed by more homophonic ones. ... the organization of the variation set is not so much concentric—with each variation deriving coherence from its relationship to the theme—as edge-related, with each variation being lent significance by its relationship with what comes before and after it, or by the group of variations within which it is located. In other words, what gives unity to the variation set ... is not the theme as such, but rather a network of 'family resemblances', to use Wittgenstein's term, between the different variations.\"\nThere are various opinions about the organization of the \"Handel Variations\". Hans Meyer, for example, sees the divisions as nos. 1–8 ('strict'), 9–12 ('free'), 13 ('synthesis'), 14–17 ('strict') and 18–25 ('free'), culminating in the fugue. William Horne emphasizes paired variations: nos. 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 23 and 24. This helps him to group the set as 1–8, 9–18, 19–25, with each group ending with a fermata and preceded by one or more variation pairs. John Rink, focusing on Brahms's dynamic markings, writes,\n\"Brahms takes pains to control the intensity level throughout the twenty-five variations, maintaining a state of flux in the first half, and then keeping the temperature perceptibly low after the peak in Variations 13–15 until the massive 'crescendo' towards the fugue begins in Variation 23. We thus find a sensitivity to motion and momentum that complements—and possibly transcends in importance to the listener—the elegance of structure about which so many authors have (legitimately) enthused.\nUnity is maintained, at least in part, by using Handel's key signature of B major throughout most of the set, varied by only a few exceptions in the tonic minor, and by repeating Handel's four-bar/two-part structure, including the repeats, in most of the work.\n\nThe performer of the audio files in this section is Martha Goldstein.\nHandel's theme is divided into two parts, each four bars in length and each repeated. The elegant aria moves in stately quarter notes in time with \"a ceremonial character typical of its period\". The harmonic progressions are elementary. Every bar except one has one or two decorations. The melody consists of a one-bar figure in the right hand consisting mostly of a trill and a turn; it is repeated in a rising sequence three times followed by a fourth descending repetition; a decorative flourish finishes the first half of the variation, which is then repeated. The left hand plays solid chords in support throughout, three quarter-note chords to each bar setting the pace followed by a rhythmic eighth-note chord leading to the next bar and emphasizing its first beat. The second half follows a similar pattern, varied mainly by alterations to the turns.\nBrahms's first variation stays close to the melody and harmonies of Handel's theme while changing its character completely. It uses staccato throughout and its syncopated accents are distinctly non-Baroque. The dynamic marking \"poco \" (a bit louder), too, clearly separates it from Handel's elegant aria. In tempo the variation seems much more hurried, crisp, even dance-like; each time the right hand \"pauses\" on an eighth note, the left hand fills in with sixteenth notes. At the end of the two sections, Brahms replaces Handel's decorations with brilliant up- and down-scale runs.\nMinor-key inflections in Variations 2 to 4 increase the distance from Handel and lay the groundwork for Variations 5 and 6, in the tonic minor.\n\nVariation 2 is a subtle piece with a flowing, lilting rhythm. Complexity is added as Brahms uses a favourite technique, found throughout his works, with triple time in one voice—in this case, triplets in the right hand—against duple time in the other. While explicitly recalling the melody of Handel's theme, the chromaticism of this variation adds to the sense of a world beyond the Baroque. In the first half the pattern is of phrases rising on the scale with a crescendo, then falling away in a shorter decrescendo. The second half climbs both in pitch and dynamics to a high climax, again falling away quickly. There is a smooth transition to the next variation.\nThe elegant third variation, marked \"dolce\", moves at a more leisurely pace, providing a sense of calm after two rather busy variations. It also provides a much-needed contrast with the following thunderous variation. Right and left hands alternate and overlap, the left imitating the right in a pattern of three eighth notes. The first note of each group is played staccato, adding to the sense of lightness. The occasional rolled chord adds interest.\n\nThe fourth variation, marked \"risoluto\", is a showpiece, with sixteenth notes played in octaves in both hands, strong accents (the \"sforzandos\" are frequently emphasized by six-note chords) and climaxes that rise a full octave higher than Handel's theme. The charging, syncopated rhythm places the stress on the last sixteenth note of almost every beat. Although no tempo indications are given, this variation is often performed at great speed.\nAfter the mighty sounds of the previous variation, the lyrical fifth variation begins quietly. The change of mood is emphasized by a shift to the tonic minor (B minor). This is the first variation in a key different from Handel's. Numerous small crescendos and decrescendos underscore the \"espressivo\" marking. The melody moves upward at a measured pace in eighth notes while the left hand accompanies with broken chords in sixteenth notes in contrary motion. The mood is peaceful and tranquil. A pairing between this variation and the following one is created by the use of the tonic minor key signature and contrary motion.\nLike the preceding variation, this piece is in the tonic minor and features contrary motion, and the motives of the two variations are similar. Marked \" sempre\" with legato phrasing, Variation 6 has a hushed, mysterious tone. The pace is measured, as both hands are written mainly in eighth notes with short sequences of sixteenth notes providing variety. Here Brahms uses counterpoint in the form of a two-part canon in octaves, including inverted canon for several measures in the second half.\n\nEchoing the pairing of Variations 5 and 6, the seventh variation is paired with the eighth. Returning to Handel's original B major, Variation 7 is fast, exciting, high-spirited, and fundamentally rhythmic in nature. A sustained drumbeat effect is created by the emphatic repetition of its upper notes and a staccato rhythm throughout all three voices. Because of the repeated upper notes, the focus moves to the inner voices. Numerous accents add further emphasis to the highly rhythmic character of this variation: in some bars in the first half, accents are placed on the last beat of the bar, while in the second half, the accents are yet more numerous, assigned to every beat except the last of each bar. Each half ends in a peak of excitement, marked \"forte\" with arpeggios in contrary motion. It leads seamlessly into 8.\n\nVariation 8 continues the rhythmic excitement of Variation 7, the left hand beating out, on the same note over and over, the same anapestic rhythm as the preceding variation. After a few bars, the two voices of the right hand are flipped. A fermata at the close provides a moment of silence before 9 begins and signals the end of the first section.\n\nVariation 9 slows the pace of the series, with a sense of grandeur as both treble and bass move in stately, ominous octaves. The piece is highly chromatic, and, like several earlier variations, treble and bass are in contrary motion throughout. Each two-bar phrase begins with two exclamatory chords, as if sounding an alarm. The variation starts an octave higher than Handel's theme, and its repeated two-bar pattern continually ascends, increasing in tension, until the climax, when it reaches a full two octaves higher than Handel.\nIn contrast to the preceding number, Variation 10 is \"Allegro energico\", fast and exhilarating. Its rather odd effect sounds almost devoid of melody, as the main notes of the theme are scattered among various registers. The first half consists of a series of startling gestures that begin with large, loud chords (\" energetico\") in the higher registers followed by echoes progressively lower, ending deep in the bass in a series of single notes played . The second half rushes to a great climax.\n\nAfter the tension of Variations 7–10, the next two variations are sweet and melodic. Variation 11 uses counterpoint and has a simple, pleasant air with its rock-steady rhythm in the right hand while the left hand simply plays two notes to one. Variations 11 and 12 are another example of the pairing of variations which is so characteristic of the work.\nThe quietness and delicacy of Variation 12 prepares for the return of the dark tonic minor in Variation 13. The left hand is similar to Variation 17, in the same rhythm as the left hand of Handel's theme.\n\nVariation 13 returns to the tonic minor in a funereal mood. It is the middle variation of the set and, in the view of Denis Matthews, the emotional centre. Right-hand sixths play against rolled chords in the left, perhaps suggesting muffled drums. For Tovey the lugubrious tone suggests a \"kind of Hungarian funeral march\", while Malcolm MacDonald sees it as \"florid\" and \"a Hungarian fantasia\". Here Brahms abandons the usual repeat signs because each passage that would have been repeated is instead written an octave higher.\n\nVariations 13 and 14, while very different in character, are paired in being fast and exciting and in their use of parallel sixths in the right hand.\n\nVariation 14, marked \"sciolto\" (\"loose\") breaks the dark mood of Variation 13 and returns to the original key. With its extended trills and scalar runs in sixths in the right hand against broken octaves in the left hand, it is a virtuoso showpiece. The mood is of great energy, excitement, and high spirits. It leads without a break into the following variation.\n\nDonald Francis Tovey sees a grouping in Variations 14–18, which he describes as \"aris[ing] one out of the other in a wonderful decrescendo of tone and crescendo of Romantic beauty\".\n\nFollowing without a pause from the previous number, Variation 15, marked \"forte\", is a bravura variation building relentlessly toward an exciting climax. It consists of a one-bar pattern, varied only slightly, of two declamatory chords in eighth notes in the higher registers, followed by lower sixteenth notes that echo Handel's original turns. A prominent upbeat creates syncopated energy. It has been called an étude for Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 2. It breaks the structural mould of Handel's theme by adding one \"extra\" bar. In Brahms's first autograph, Variations 15 and 16 were positioned in the reverse order.\nVariation 16 continues from Variation 15 as a \"variation of variation\", repeating the pattern of two high eighth notes followed by a run of lower sixteenth notes. It also forms another pairing with Variation 17. Baroque contrapuntal techniques appear again in this canon, described by Malcolm MacDonald as \"wittier\" than the canon of Variation 6. The left hand begins with two descending staccato eighth notes, immediately followed in the opposite hand by the two eighth notes inverted, a full four octaves higher. In each case, a figure in sixteenth notes follows in canonic imitation. The effect is light and exhilarating.\nIn Variation 17, the absence of the sixteenth notes that were so prominent in the preceding two variations gives the impression of a slowing, despite the marking of \"più mosso\". The effect is of gently falling raindrops, with gracefully descending broken chords in the right hand, \"piano\" and staccato, repeated throughout the work at various pitches. Each note is played twice, adding to the suggestion of a leisurely pace.\nAnother \"variation of a variation\", paired with the preceding Variation 17. The accompaniment from the previous variation, which now echoes the melody of the aria, is now syncopated and alternating between the hands, while the \"raindrops\" are replaced by sweeping arpeggios.\n\nThis slow, relaxing variation, with its lilting rhythm and time, is written in the dance style of a Baroque French siciliana from the school of Couperin (Brahms had edited Couperin's music). It uses chords almost exclusively in the root position, perhaps as another reminiscence of \"antique\" music. In a technique often used by Brahms, the melodic line is hidden in an inner part. This variation opens a lengthy quiet section which includes nos. 19–22, \"not noticeably interrelated\".\n\nFrom the outset, Variation 20 builds toward its climax. In contrast to the preceding variation, there is little of the Baroque in it with its chromaticism in both treble and bass and its thick textures (triads in the right hand against octaves in the left hand). Malcolm MacDonald refers to its \"organ-loft progressions\".\n\nVariation 21 moves to the relative minor (G minor). Like Variation 19, the theme is hidden, in this case by merely gracing the main notes of the theme in passing, thereby achieving a sense of lightness. It is another example of Brahms' use of polyrhythms, this time pairing three notes against four.\nThe light mood of the preceding variation continues in Variation 22. Often referred to as the \"musical-box\" variation because of the regularity of its rhythm, underlined particularly by a drone bass, Variation 22 alludes to the Baroque musette, a soft pastoral air imitating the sound music of a bagpipe, or \"musette\". It remains in the high registers, consistently above Handel's theme, the lowest note being the repeated B of the drone.\n\nThe light mood prepares the way for the climactic, concluding section which, in Tovey's words, comes \"swarming up energetically out of darkness\".\n\nAt Variation 23 the rise toward a final climax begins. It is clearly paired with the following Variation 24, which continues its pattern but in a more hurried, more urgent manner.\nIn preparation for the climactic final variation, Variation 24 intensifies the excitement, replacing the triplets of Variation 23 with masses of sixteenth notes. Clearly modeled on the preceding, it is another example of Brahms's use of \"variation of variation\".\nAn exultant showpiece, Variation 25 ends the variations and leads into the concluding fugue. Its strong resemblance to Variation 1 ties the set together, as they both feature a left hand which fills the pauses in the right.\n\nThe powerful concluding fugue brings the variation set to a climactic close. Its subject, repeated many times from beginning to end, derives from the opening of Handel's theme. At its most microscopic level, the subject comes solely from the ascending major second from the first two beats in the top voice of Handel's theme. The ascending second is stated twice in sixteenth notes and repeated again a major third higher. This parallels the first measure of Handel's theme, which ascends from B to C to D to E. The following melodic line of the second measure resembles the second measure of Handel's theme in general trajectory (Brahms's theme is also strikingly similar to the subject of Fugue VI from Felix Mendelssohn's Six Preludes and Fugues, Op. 35, also in B major). Julian Littlewood observes that the fugue has \"a dense contrapuntal argument which recalls Bach more than Handel\". Denis Matthews adds that it is \"more redolent of one of Bach's great organ fugues than any in The Well-Tempered Clavier, with inversions, augmentation and double counterpoint to match, and a great peroration over a swinging dominant pedal-point\". Despite its magnitude, Littlewood suggests, the fugue avoids separation from the rest of the set by its comparable texture. \"In this way it systematically creates a web of links between past and present, achieving synthesis rather than quotation or parody.\" Michael Musgrave in \" The Music of Brahms\" writes,\"Brahms brings his subject, derived, like that of the Diabelli fugue, from the theme, into contrapuntal relationships involving diminution, augmentation, stretto, building to the final peroration through a long dominant pedal with two distinct ideas above. But the pianism is an equal part of the conception, and in this, the most complex example of Brahms's virtuoso style, the characteristic spacings in thirds, sixths and wide spans between the hands are employed as never before. Indeed, the pianistic factor serves to create the great contrasts within the fugue, which transcends a traditional fugal movement to create a further set of variations, in which many of the previous textures are recalled in the context of the equally transformed fugal theme.\"\n\nAn entry in Clara Schumann's diary about the \"Handel Variations\" gives an idea of how close the relationship between her and Brahms was, as well as Brahms's sometimes extraordinary insensitivity: \"On Dec 7th I gave another soirée, at which I played Johannes' \"Handel Variations\". I was in agonies of nervousness, but I played them well all the same, and they were much applauded. Johannes, however, hurt me very much by his indifference. He declared that he could no longer bear to hear the variations, it was altogether too dreadful for him to listen to anything of his own and to have to sit by and do nothing. Although I can well understand this feeling, I cannot help finding it hard when one has devoted all one's powers to a work, and the composer himself has not a kind word for it.\" Yet in the following spring (April 1862) Brahms wrote, in a note to a critic to whom he was sending a copy of the work, \"I am fond of it and value it particularly in relation to my other works\".\n\nClara Schumann premiered the work in Hamburg on December 7, when she visited Brahms's home town to give a series of performances, which also included the Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor—which had not been well received when Brahms introduced it to Leipzig in the Gewandhaus in January 1858—and the premiere of the Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor. Clara's performance of the \"Handel Variations\" in Hamburg was a triumph, which she repeated soon afterward in Leipzig. During that winter, Brahms also gave performances of the \"Handel Variations\", as a result of which he made minor alterations to the score. Publication came in July 1862 by Breitkopf & Härtel.\n\nWith the \"complete failure,\" as he described it to Clara, of his first large-scale orchestral work, the First Piano Concerto, the Handel Variations became an important landmark in the developing career of Brahms. Another seven years passed before his reputation was firmly established by \"A German Requiem\" in Bremen in 1868, and it took a full fifteen years before he made his mark as a symphonist with his first symphony (1876).\n\nDuring what was probably the first meeting of Brahms and Richard Wagner in January 1863, Brahms performed his \"Handel Variations\". Despite the great differences between the two men in musical style and an underlying tension based on musical politics—Brahms championing a more conservative approach to music while Wagner, along with Franz Liszt, called for \"the music of the future\" with new forms and new tonalities—Wagner complimented the work graciously, if not wholeheartedly, saying, \"One sees what still may be done in the old forms when someone comes along who knows how to use them\".\n\nThe piece is often heard in a version that was arranged for orchestra by the British composer and Brahms enthusiast Edmund Rubbra in 1938. The orchestration was first performed at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Adrian Boult. The ballet \"Brahms/Handel\", made by New York City Ballet balletmaster Jerome Robbins in collaboration with Twyla Tharp, was set to this orchestration. The work has also been transcribed for solo organ by French-Canadian composer Rachel Laurin.\n\n"}

Located between Beach Street and Shirley Avenue, it serves the MBTA Blue Line. It serves Revere Beach, a popular summer destination with a substantial year-round resident population. It opened in January 1954 on the site of a former Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad station, as part of an extension to Wonderland. Revere Beach station was closed and rebuilt from 1994 to 1995.\n\nLike all Blue Line stations from Airport east, Revere Beach has two tracks and two side platforms. Uniquely among Blue Line stations, it is located below grade in a trench, with a surface-level fare lobby. Entrances to the station are from Beach Street and Shirley Avenue.\n\nThe narrow gauge Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad (BRB&L) opened from East Boston to Lynn on July 29, 1875. The line ran directly adjacent to the beachfront, a popular summer destination, on the alignment of the modern Revere Beach Boulevard. Revere station was located between Beach Street and Shirley Avenue. The station was renamed Pavilion in the late 1870s and Crescent Beach in 1884.\n\nThe Eastern Railroad-backed Boston, Winthrop, and Shore Railroad (BW&S) operated slightly inland in 1884 and 1885, with its own Crescent Beach station just west of the BRB&L station. In April 1897, the BRB&L was moved inland onto the BW&S right-of-way, with Crescent Beach station relocated to the new alignment. By 1928 the line was electrified, with pre-pay stations - more a rapid transit line than a conventional railroad. However, due to the Great Depression, the BRB&L shut down on January 27, 1940.\n\nIn 1941, the Boston Elevated Railway bought the BRB&L right of way from Day Square to Revere Beach for use as a high-speed trolley line similar to the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line; these plans were delayed by the onset of World War II. The 1926 \"Report on Improved Transportation Facilities\" and 1945–47 \"Coolidge Commission Report\" recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the BBRB&L route rather than using it for a trolley line.\n\nIn 1947, the newly formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (M.T.A.) decided to build to Lynn as a rapid transit line, and construction began in October 1948. The first part of the Revere Extension opened to Orient Heights in January 1952 and Suffolk Downs in April 1952; the second phase (cut short due to limited funds) opened to Wonderland on January 19, 1954 with intermediate stations at Beachmont and Revere Beach.\n\nRevere Beach station was closed for approximately one year starting on June 25, 1994 as the station was rebuilt along with Suffolk Downs, Beachmont, and Wonderland stations as part of the Blue Line Modernization Program. Blue Line service temporarily ended at Orient Heights and buses served the closed stations during the project Revere Beach station was largely rebuilt at a cost of $9.8 million; it reopened along with the other stations on June 24, 1995.\n\nThe station was closed while additional platform repair work was performed from August 2 through 29, 2008.\n\n"}

His first full-time job was as a reporter for \"The Charlotte Observer\". After approximately one year there, he joined the \"Ann Arbor News\" in 1992 and spent two years covering the University of Michigan.\n\nIn 1994, Whitlock was hired by the \"Kansas City Star\". The Scripps Howard Foundation awarded Whitlock its National Journalism Award for commentary on March 7, 2008. Whitlock was the first sportswriter to win the award and $10,000 prize.

However, after the announcement, Whitlock was interviewed by sports blog The Big Lead, and disparaged two of his ESPN colleagues. Whitlock labeled Mike Lupica \"an insecure, mean-spirited busybody\", and called Robert \"Scoop\" Jackson a \"clown\", saying that \"the publishing of [Jackson's] fake ghetto posturing is an insult to black intelligence.\" Jackson, like Whitlock, is African-American. Whitlock then disappeared from all ESPN television work. He soon announced to \"The Kansas City Star\" readers in September 2006 that he was fired altogether from ESPN as a result of his remarks; he wrote that the company doesn't tolerate criticism and acted as they saw fit.

He originally titled it \"Grande Marche Chromatique\", reflecting the use of chromatic scales throughout the piece, but changed the title based on his personal interest in the Roman Empire.\n\nGenerally, the march is divided into three parts. The first part contains the melody that the trumpet keeps and the several supporting parts. The second third is the section where the low brass (mainly the tubas) take over with the chromatic scale like role. Finally there is a trio, or a softer melodic section, where there is a strong balance between woodwinds and low brass. The trio has a part similar to the second third with a chromatic scale-like sound. The piece is written in cut time and is originally written to be played at standard march tempo, but when played as a screamer it is usually played much faster. \n\nCzech composer Julius Fučík wrote the march on October 17, 1899 in Sarajevo, where he had been stationed as military bandmaster of the Austro-Hungarian Army since 1897. Originally, he called the piece Grande Marche Chromatique. The march demonstrates the state of the art in playing technology and the construction of brass instruments, which allowed fast and even chromatic gears in all instruments and positions. Fučík was so impressed by the description of a gladiator appearance in a Roman amphitheater in Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel Quo Vadis (1895, German: 1896) that he soon changed the title of his work. The phrase \"entry of the gladiators\" is known in two descriptions of Pompeii in 1877 and is probably older. \n\nOn January 10, 1900 Kapellmeister Anton Fridrich (1849-1924, Khevenhüller-Marsch) created an arrangement for string orchestra for himself in Graz. In July 1900, the \"Concert March for large orchestra\", published by Hoffmann’s widow in Prague, is listed under the title Einzug der Gladiatoren by Hofmeister. Further edits followed. In 1903 one of the H.M. Coldstream Guard Band's pre-recorded clay roller advertised by Columbia Records titled Entry of the Gladiators. In the same year a piano score with the title Entry of the Gladiators / Thunder and Blazes ('Donner und Feuersbrünste') was released. The phrase Entrance of the Gladiators, which has existed since at least the 18th century, is also common in English.\n\nHermann Ludwig Blankenburg published his farewell to the gladiators at the latest in 1904. In 1928, both pieces were recorded by the \"Great Odeon Orchestra\" on a plate (No. 85204). \n\nIn 1901, the Canadian composer Louis-Philippe Laurendeau rewrote the piece, used a faster tempo and a different key and published it as Thunder and Blazes. Laurendeau often worked for Carl Fischer Music in New York. Americans are used to hearing the march at a much faster pace. The piece became known in the North American circus and imported back to Europe. Especially in a very fast version, it is the most famous circus music for clowns. It is also often found in the repertoire of mechanical music automatons.\n\nIn 1901, American publisher Carl Fischer published a version of this march, arranged for American wind bands by Canadian composer Louis-Philippe Laurendeau, under the title \"Thunder and Blazes\". It was during this period that the piece gained lasting popularity as a screamer march for circuses, often used to introduce clowns. Today it is known mainly by this association. Laurendeau's version was also transcribed for fairground organs. \n\nThe Julius Fučík's Entrance of the Gladiators is also quoted in the 1963 novelty song \"Yakety Sax\", which have been parodied in many movies and TV shows, including \"V for Vendetta\", \"Doctor Who\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\", and \"South Park.\" The march receives the occasional concert hall performance, such as at the 2007 Last Night of the Proms.\n\n\n"}

During the Civil War, she destroyed the CSS \"Governor Moore\" and served in blockade operations. She was attached to the Asiatic Squadron from 1867–1870. She sank in 1870 outside Yokohama, Japan after collision with the British steamer \"Bombay\". A court of inquiry, headed by the local British consul, found the officers of \"Oneida\" were responsible for the collision, with \"Bombay's\" captain being blamed for not staying at the scene to render assistance - a decision that caused some controversy.. A less exhaustive U.S. naval court of inquiry laid the blame entirely on the \"Bombay\"'s actions. Japanese fishing boats saved 61 sailors but 125 men lost their lives. The American government made no attempt to raise the wreck and sold it to a Japanese wrecking company. The company recovered many bones from the wreck and interred them at their own expense. The Japanese erected a memorial tablet on the grounds of Ikegami Temple in Tokyo and held a Buddhist ceremony in the sailor's memory in May 1889.\n\n\"Oneida\" was authorized by Act of Congress, February 1861, and built at the New York Navy Yard; launched 20 November 1861; and commissioned 28 February 1862, Captain Samuel Phillips Lee in command.\n\nShortly after commissioning \"Oneida\" sailed from New York and joined the West Gulf Blockading Squadron commanded by Flag officer David Farragut. On 24 April 1862 she participated in the attacks on Forts Jackson and St. Philip below New Orleans, Louisiana, and drove off the Confederate ram which sank the steam gunboat . \"Oneida\" destroyed the gunboat CSS \"Governor Moore\" in a following engagement on the same date.\n\nOn 27 April 1862 \"Oneida\" destroyed obstructions in the Mississippi River above Carrollton, Mississippi, helping prepare the way for the Vicksburg campaign. In both passages of the Confederate works at Vicksburg, Mississippi – on 28 June 1862 and 15 July 1862 – by the Union fleet under Rear Admiral Farragut, \"Oneida\" was second in line.\n\nOn 7 August 1862, under the command of Commander George H. Preble, \"Oneida\" collided with the steamer \"Whiteman\" or \"Lewis Whitman\" (sources differ) loaded with dead and wounded troops from the Battle of Baton Rouge, including the body of Brigadier General Thomas Williams, on the Mississippi River near Donaldsonville, Louisiana; the steamer sank with the loss of all hands. Early in September 1862, \"Oneida\" failed in an attempt to stop the passage of the Confederate States Navy sloop-of-war CSS \"Florida\" into Mobile, Alabama.\n\nFrom 15 October 1863 to 23 August 1864, under the command of Captain C. V. Gridley, \"Oneida\" served in blockade operations off Mobile, where on 5 August she participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay and the subsequent capture of CSS \"Tennessee\". At a later date she witnessed the surrender of Fort Morgan at Mobile. \"Oneida\" decommissioned pn 11 August 1865 at New York City.\n\nSeven sailors and one Marine from \"Oneida\" were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at the Battle of Mobile Bay. These men were:\n\nIn late June 1865, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, the sternwheel paddle steamer \"Echo No. 2\" struck \"Oneida\"′s prow and sank in the Ohio River near Cairo, Illinois, while carrying 300 soldiers of the 13th and 41st Ohio Veteran Volunteer Regiments. The regiments lost rations and a combined 10 horses and 13 mules in the sinking. The soldiers blamed the pilot guiding \"Echo No. 2\" for the accident and beat him.\n\nRecommissioned in May 1867, she was attached to the Asiatic Squadron and continued in that capacity until January 1870.\n\n\"Oneida\" departed from Yokohama, Japan on 24 January 1870, on passage back to the United States. Some 12 miles into this voyage, she was struck by the British Peninsula & Oriental steamer \"Bombay\", at 6:30 pm near Saratoga Spit. The Court of Inquiry unanimously held that the officers of \"Oneida\" were entirely to blame for the collision. The \"Oneida\" was under the command of an inexperienced junior officer whilst the senior officers were at dinner. On seeing a light ahead, this young officer had sought the advice of a navigating officer who briefly came on deck and then returned to dinner. Confusing helm orders were given on \"Oneida\", with the result that \"Bombay's\" efforts to avoid collision were in vain and she struck \"Oneida\" at an angle of 45 degrees, abaft the mizzen chains. The starboard quarter was cut off \"Oneida\" and she sank at 6:45 pm in 20 fathoms (37 m) of water with the loss of 125 men, 61 sailors being saved in two Japanese fishing boats. The loss of life on the \"Oneida\" was compounded by a shortage of boats: 3 of the ship's boats had been lost in a typhoon the previous August and not replaced, 2 were destroyed in the collision, leaving only 2, which were lowered immediately.\n\nThere is controversy over the subsequent actions of Captain Eyre of the \"Bombay\". He was accused of steaming on without rendering assistance. He had his certificate suspended for 6 months by the Court of Inquiry and the ship itself was libeled, meaning that steamer and other ships of the P.& O. Line were kept away from American ports. The findings of the Inquiry were debated in the House of Commons, with speakers making clear that \"Bombay\" remained at the position of the collision for, by varying reports, between 5 or 6 minutes and 10 or 12 minutes, whilst \"Oneida\" carried on under full sail and steam, with a full tide under her. No indication of distress from \"Oneida\" were seen or heard on \"Bombay\" (\"Oneida's\" crew admitted they did not show any blue lights), it would have been time-consuming to turn the ship in a narrow channel, making the provision of any useful help impossible, and the position of \"Oneida\" was not clear as she was not showing any lights. Furthermore, there was damage to \"Bombay\", with 9 feet of water in the forward compartment, the ship was 18 years old and carrying a number of passengers.\n\nThe wreck of the \"Oneida\" was sold at public auction at Yokohama 9 October 1872, to Mr. Tatchobonaiya. Inside the wreckage were found many of the bones of the dead sailors, which were interred, at the expense of the salvagers, on the grounds of Ikegami Temple in Tokyo. In \"Jinrikisha Days in Japan\" (1891), Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore tells the story, writing:\n\nAccording to records regarding the \"Oneida\", she was leaving port carrying payment for sales of ammunition and gunpowder to the Japanese government. Around 1955, Takeshita Hisao led an effort to salvage the loaded payment, as well as other artifacts from the \"Oneida\" wreck. Artifacts including coins, ammunition shells, rifles, and further bones from deceased sailors and passengers were found. The recovered steam gauge was later donated to the United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka. In 2010, a special aired 9 November on Fuji Television made a further effort at salvage with the help of Takeshita's family and one of the divers from the 1955 effort. The show's salvage team located a shipwreck that matched descriptions of the \"Oneida\", and efforts continue to discover more about the wreckage and remaining contents.\n\n"}

Dense granules are found only in platelets and are smaller than α-granules. The origin of these dense granules is still unknown, however, it is thought that may come from the mechanism involving the endocytotic pathway. Dense granules are a sub group of lysosome-related organelles (LRO). There are about three to eight of these in a normal human platelet.\n\nThey are found in animals and in unicellular organisms including Apicomplexa protozoans.\n\nThey are also found in \"Entamoeba\".\n\nDense granules play a major role in Toxoplasma gondii. When the parasite invades it releases its dense granules which help to create the parasitophorous vacuole.\n\nThe dense granules of human platelets contain adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), ionized calcium (which is necessary for several steps of the coagulation cascade), and serotonin. Dense granules are similar to lysosomes with an acidic pH and even some lysosomal proteins like CD63. There is a granular adenine nucleotide pool within the dense granule. It is thought that it is made up of system of insoluble calcium. This pool is likely to be different than that of the cytoplasmic nucleotides. In some animals it has been shown that the platelets contain histamine. During exocytosis, the pool of ATP within the dense granule is released. Serotonin is picked up by the dense granules where it interacts with ATP and calcium. The serotonin that is then released by the dense granule, recruits other platelets and helps play a major role in stopping the loss of blood at the injury. The calcium from a dense granule accounts for the majority of the calcium within the platelets and plays a role in the binding of different proteins.\n\nA deficiency of CD63 can be associated with Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome. The patients with this disease show signs of abnormal dense granules and melanosomes which can cause prolonged bleeding and albinism. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder where patients platelets are have a deficient amount of dense granules. CHS is very similar to beige mouse. \n\nThe dense granule is very important in the coagulation cascade because of the bleeding disorders caused by a dense granule deficiency. However, the exact details of how it created is unknown. It has been observed that they are produced in bone marrow by megakaryocytes. Within the megakaryocytes it is thought that their production has something to do with the endocytotic pathway. Dense granules have their components sent to maturing dense granules using vesicular nucleotide transporters. This is what is thought to cause the build up of ADP/ATP in dense granules. This mechanism is also responsible for the build up of MRP4 which picks up cAMP for the dense granule. Mice with MRP4-/- will have dysfunctional platelets from cAMP not being takin up from the cytosol and placed into the dense granule.\n\nThere are a number of proteins that are within the dense granule membrane. To maintain the low pH within the granule, there is a Hydrogen ion pumping ATPase. Ral has been found within the granule's membrane. There are several adhesive receptors that have luminal binding domains and are expressed post exocytosis. These adhesive receptors help the adhesive receptors on the surface of the platelets. One of these receptors is GPIb. GPIb is one of the more important receptors within platelets.\n\nThe true function of a dense granule is still unknown. However, the secretion of dense granules occurs along with platelet activation. Both, ADP and collagen can cause the secretion of dense granules. Patients and mice with dense granule deficiency have a harder time forming a hemostatic plug and therefore have a longer bleed time.\n\nThe dense granules' matrix is dense with electrons that allow them to be detected through whole mount electron microscopy. The calcium levels within the dense granule allows for no extra staining when viewing the dense granule with an electron microscope. When observed by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), these granules are osmophilic. The secretion of dense granules can be detected by seeing how much ATP/ADP is being released with luciferase-based luminescence. The relationship to ATP/ADP released can be used to then determine the secretion of dense granules. Another option is to observe the amount of serotonin being released from a platelet with a large amount of serotonin already on it. Another way to detect the secretion of dense granules is through flow cytometry. Since dense granules have surface membrane proteins, the activation of CD63 and LAMP-2 can be observed with flow cytometry. \n\n"}

It is located in the Charlestown neighborhood off Austin Street near New Rutherford Avenue (MA-99), under the double-decked elevated structure carrying Interstate 93 to the Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge. The station is named for the adjacent Bunker Hill Community College. Like all Orange Line stations, Community College station is fully accessible.\n\nCommunity College station is located under the double-decked elevated Interstate 93 at the southwest edge of Charlestown, Boston, just south of Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC) and west of New Rutherford Avenue (Route 99). East Cambridge and the NorthPoint development are to the southwest, with the MBTA Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility and the Inner Belt District industrial park to the northwest and highway ramps to the southeast.\n\nThe station has two island platforms and three tracks. Only the west platform is in use; inbound (southbound) tracks use the west track, with outbound trains using the center track. The east platform and track are not used for revenue service. A fare mezzanine is located over the tracks at the south end of the station. The mezzanine is connected to the north sidewalk of the Gilmore Bridge, which carries Austin Street over the Orange Line and the North Station approach tracks. A footbridge also connects the mezzanine directly to BHCC.\n\nFor much of the 19th century, the four major northside railroads (the Fitchburg, Boston and Lowell (B&L), Boston and Maine (B&M), and Eastern) did not share any trackage on the approach to Boston. (Not until North Union Station in 1893 did they share a depot). At that time, Charlestown was separated from East Cambridge by a large cove, Millers River. The Fitchburg crossed the B&M and the Eastern at Prison Point (then the site of a substantial state prison), near the modern location of Community College station. The Fitchburg and B&M had substantial freight depots nearby, and the B&M briefly had a Charlestown station around the 1850s. The Fitchburg's Charlestown station was to the west nearer East Cambridge: at what is now Linwood Street by the 1850s, and near what is now Water Street (near the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility) by the 1890s. (For some period after the Boston terminal replaced the Charlestown terminal in 1848, however, a flag stop was made at the Prison Point Bridge.)\n\nThe Charlestown Elevated section of the Boston Elevated Railway's Main Line opened in June 1901, with three elevated stations in Charlestown. The Thompson Square station was located one-third of a mile east of the current station along Austin Street at Main Street, while the City Square station was located half a mile south along Rutherford Avenue at Chelsea Street. The elevated was unpopular with many local residents, as it was noisy and blocked out sunlight to Main Street. In 1917, the elevated structure was slated to be replaced with a more permanent subway line along the same Main Street routing, but this project was canceled by the US's entry into World War I.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the MBTA began work on the Haymarket North Extension project. It included a tunnel segment north from Haymarket through a new underground stop at North Station, then under the Charles River to a portal south of the Gilmore Bridge. From there, the extension was built along the Haverhill Line commuter rail right of way. Community College station was built to replace the two elevated stops nearby in Charlestown. The new route opened to Sullivan Square on April 7, 1975. The Main Line had previously been renamed as the Orange Line in 1967, as part of a systemwide rebranding by the newly formed MBTA.\n\nLike the Sullivan Square and Wellington stations, Community College was built with a second island platform serving the outbound track plus a third express track. This extra infrastructure was to be used for the Orange Line's planned extension to Reading to replace commuter rail service on the line. (Continuing commuter rail service to Andover and Haverhill was to be via the Wildcat Branch). However, the Orange Line extension was cut short to Oak Grove due to local opposition in Melrose, and no express service ever ran. The second platform is open for outbound passengers at busy Sullivan Square and Wellington, but at less-busy Community College it sits unused.\n\nUnlike the four other original stations on the Haymarket North Extension, Community College was not built with a busway. Bus routes in East Cambridge already terminated at Lechmere station to the west, while Charlestown routes and already extended to Haymarket station along historic streetcar routings. Routes and , which had terminated at City Square, were not extended to Community College; route 111 was instead extended to Haymarket, while route 112 was rerouted to . In December 1975, outbound trips on route 92 were rerouted to Rutherford Avenue between Austin Street and School Street to serve BHCC and the station. However, it returned to its previous routing by December 1977.\n\nThe station was not originally accessible. An elevator to the main platform, reached by a footbridge between the platforms, was constructed as part of the Big Dig. Bidding took place in 2002. Shaft framework was installed for the unused second platform, but no elevator machinery was installed. The renovations were completed around 2005. \n\n"}

Many variations of his last name are seen and he is sometimes incorrectly called Johan Wessel.\n\nGansfort has been called one of the reformers before the Reformation. He protested against a perceived paganizing of the papacy, superstitious and magical uses of the sacraments, the authority of ecclesiastical tradition, and the tendency in later scholastic theology to lay greater stress, in a doctrine of justification, upon the instrumentality of the human will than on the work of Christ for man's salvation.\n\nGansfort was born at Groningen. After initial schooling at the local Latin school of St Martin's, he was educated at the municipal school of Zwolle, which was closely connected to the Brethren of the Common Life in whose house the young student lived. He developed close ties with the monastery of Mount St. Agnes not far from Zwolle, and became close friends with Thomas a Kempis.\n\nHis sixteenth-century biographer Albertus Hardenberg, who knew Gansfort's one-time \"famulus\" Goswinus van Halen, writes that Gansfort left Zwolle directly for Cologne, perhaps as late as 1449. At Cologne he stayed in the \"Bursa Laurentiana\", where he soon became a teacher. He was granted the degree \"magister artium\" in 1452, and remembers with great gratitude that it was here that he first studied Plato. He learned Greek from monks who had been driven out of Greece, and Hebrew from some Jews. He was particularly interested in the Eucharistic theology of Rupert von Deutz, and he scoured local Benedictine libraries for works related to this devotion.\n\nInterest in the disputes between the realists and the nominalists in Paris induced him to go to that city, where he remained for sixteen years as a scholar and teacher. There, he eventually took the nominalist side, prompted as much by his mystical anti-ecclesiastical tendencies as by any metaphysical insight; for the nominalists were then the anti-papal party. A desire to know more about humanism sent him to Rome, where in 1470 he was the intimate friend of Italian scholars and under the protection of Cardinals Bessarion and Francesco della Rovere (general of the Franciscan order and afterwards Pope Sixtus IV). It is said that Sixtus would have gladly made Wessel a bishop, but that he had no desire for any ecclesiastical preferment but rather asked for a Hebrew Old Testament. This he took to Groningen, where he studied the text aloud to the bemusement of his fellow monks.\n\nFrom Rome, Wessel returned to Paris and speedily became a famous teacher, gathering round him a band of enthusiastic young students, among whom was Reuchlin. In 1475, he was at Basel and, in 1476, at Heidelberg, teaching philosophy in the university. As old age approached, he grew to dislike the theological strife of scholasticism and turned away from that university discipline, \"non studia sacrarum literarum sed studiorum commixtae corruptiones\". After thirty years of academic life, he returned to his native Groningen, and spent the rest of his life partly as director of the \"Olde Convent\", a sister convent of the Order of Tertiaries, and partly in the convent of St. Agnes at Zwolle. He was welcomed as the most renowned scholar of his time, and it was fabled that he had travelled through all lands, Egypt as well as Greece, gathering everywhere the fruits of all sciences. To his friends, disciples and admirers, he imparted his rhetorical spirituality, a zeal for higher learning and the deep devotional spirit which characterized his own life. He died on October 4, 1489, with the confession on his lips: \"I know only Jesus the crucified\". He was buried in the middle of the choir of the church of the \"Olde Convent\", which stood on what is now called the Rode Weeshuistraat but at the time was known as the Straat van de Geestelijke Maagden, whose director he had been. His bones were unearthed in 1862 in the presence of Gansfort's progeny, members of the American Gansevoort family. His remains were then relocated to the Martinikerk where a memorial had been erected. In 1962 his remains were unearthed again and taken to the Groningen anatomical laboratory for research. In absence of the main researcher, the bones were wrongly identified and for over 50 years were thought to have been destroyed. They were rediscovered in 2015 and to be reburied in the Martinikerk in 2017.\n\nThe founders of the Protestant University of Groningen in 1614 considered Wessel Gansfort one of their intellectual predecessors, together with Rudolph Agricola (1444–85) and Regnerus Praedinius (1510–59). Early editions of works by Gansfort (e.g. Zwolle 1522, Basel 1523, Groningen 1614, Marburg 1617) on their title page call him the learned light of the world (\"Lux mundi\").\n\n\nGansfort's major works are:\n\nThere are also:\n\nSeveral of his letters survive. Some his works are said to have been burned by his friends shortly after his death for fear of ecclesiastical inquisition.\n\n\nA complete edition of his works appeared at Groningen in 1614, including a biography by the Protestant preacher Albert Hardenberg.\n\n\n"}

During the first months of revenue service, the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system had safety problems with its design and operation.

The collected works are known as the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. On completion of the project, the Society dissolved itself.\n\nThe nineteenth-century society needs to be distinguished from its successor, the Neue Bachgesellschaft (New Bach Society), founded in 1900.\n\nThe founders of the society were Moritz Hauptmann, cantor of the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig, (and thus a successor of Bach); Otto Jahn, author of a noted biography of Mozart; Carl Ferdinand Becker, teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory; and the composer Robert Schumann.\n\nThe Bach-Gesellschaft began publishing Bach's works in 1851 with a volume that started with BWV 1, the cantata \"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1\". It completed publication in 1900 with its forty-sixth volume. However, the edition of \"The Art of Fugue\" by Wolfgang Graeser, published in 1926, is sometimes counted as \"Volume 47\" and was issued as a supplement to the Bach-Gesellschaft publication by Breitkopf & Härtel, publishers of the original series. Additionally, Vol. 45, part 1 includes a revised edition (\"Neue berichtige Ausgabe\") of the English Suites and French Suites that had previously been published in Vol. 13.\n\nAmong the editors was Alfred Dörffel. Brahms was one of the subscribers to the project and also served on the editorial board. A list of subscribers was printed in each volume.\n\nThe volumes varied somewhat in editorial quality and accuracy; Bach scholar Hans T. David particularly criticized Vol. 31's presentation of \"The Musical Offering\" for numerous incorrect readings, and the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" calls the edition as a whole \"of very unequal merit.\" \"Britannica\" both lauds the editing of Wilhelm Rust for the edition and notes a deterioration of standards after his death, including a volume in which \"the bass and violin are a bar apart for a whole line\" (apparently a reference to sloppy editing). In his edition of the \"Goldberg Variations,\" Ralph Kirkpatrick also calls attention to several \"mistakes of the Bachgesellschaft edition\" that he has corrected, particularly with regard to the presentation of ornaments. (It is worth noting that the Bach-Gesellschaft volume containing the \"Goldbergs\" was one of the first to be published—Vol. 3, which appeared in 1853.)\n\nNevertheless, the Bach-Gesellschaft's volumes were a groundbreaking achievement and contributed greatly to the study and appreciation of Bach's music. They remained the standard edition of Bach's complete works until the publication of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe by Bärenreiter and the Deutscher Verlag für Musik (1954-2007).\n\n"}

Founded in 1852, it houses a large collection of items relating to German culture and art extending from prehistoric times through to the present day. The Germanisches National Museum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history. \nOut of its total holding of some 1.3 million objects (including the holdings of the library and the Department of Prints and Drawings), approximately 25,000 are exhibited.\n\nThe museum is situated in the south of the historic city center between Kornmarkt and Frauentormauer along the medieval city wall. Its entrance hall is situated on Kartäusergasse which was transformed by the Israeli sculptor Dani Karavan to the Way of Human Rights ().\n\nThe Germanisches Museum, as it was named initially, was founded by a group of individuals led by the Franconian baron Hans von und zu Aufsess, whose goal was to assemble a \"well-ordered compendium of all available source material for German history, literature and art\".\n\nThe term \"Germanic\" should be understood in the historical context of the mid nineteenth century. In 1846, German linguists and historians, amongst them the Brothers Grimm, Leopold Ranke und Jacob Burckhardt, had met in Frankfurt, and decided to use \"Germanistik\" as a comprehensive term embracing all the fields of their academic disciplines related to the culture of German speaking regions. The German revolutions of 1848–49 had failed to achieve a liberalised and unified Germany. Thus the name of the museum maintained the idea of a close cultural relationship within a region defined by the common German language, and a shared German cultural tradition. In 1852, the museum's intention to document the cultural unity of the German-speaking areas was a progressive concept, free from any exaggerated Chauvinism. Only in 1871, when the German Empire was constituted, the museum paid tribute to it by adding \"national\" to its name.\n\nThe museum understands itself as an important research and educational institution. As a national museum and a museum of the entire German-speaking region the German National Museum collects and maintains cultural, artistic and historical testimonials from the beginning of history to the present. As a research and educational institution of international standing, the collections, exhibitions and publications present the cultural history of the German-speaking countries in an international and interdisciplinary approach. The work of the institution is guided by the principle of respect for all cultures, so that all human beings can understand what the museum communicates, independent of their upbringing, education, and religious beliefs.\nThe museum constitutes an architectural monument in itself, as it consists of a variety of buildings erected in different periods. It incorporates the remaining structures of the former Nuremberg Charterhouse (), dissolved in 1525 and thereafter used for a variety of secular purposes until in 1857 what was left of these premises, by then badly dilapidated, was given to the Museum. The charterhouse was rebuilt and modified to accommodate the collections until the late nineteenth century when Neo-Gothic extensions were added on its south side. During and after the First World War, the „Alter Eingang“ (\"Old Entrance\") and the „Galeriebau“ (\"Gallery building\") designed by German Bestelmeyer were built to provide an entrance from Kornmarkt and further space.\n\nAfter the destructions during the Second World War, Sep Ruf designed additional buildings; historical parts of the halls and galleries were adapted to the new architectural concept or torn down after their destruction during the war; only some buildings were restored and rebuilt. The first major building was added 1955–1958, called „Heussbau“ after the first president of West Germany, Theodor Heuss. In 1983, and from 1988–1993, the museum was substantially enlarged. The „Kartäuserbau“ with the new entrance hall situated now on Kartäusergasse was designed by Jan Störmer of architects ME DI UM. In 1999, the 1910 building of the St Lorenz's parish children's home was acquired. It was restored in 2002, and is now the home for the Collection of Children's Toys.\n\nThe collection is displayed in the following sections (denominated here as by the GNM):\n\nSome random examples of the collection are shown here:\n\nIn the section \"History of the GNM\", the painting Germania is displayed which was exhibited in St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main in 1848.\n\nThe Germanisches Nationalmuseum is a public law foundation supported by the Federal Republic of Germany, the state of Bavaria and the city of Nuremberg. Its Administrative Board is chaired by Prof. Dr. h.c. Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, the head of the General Directorate is Prof. Dr. G. Ulrich Großmann (as per 2016).\n\nAssociated to the museum are Archives, like the , libraries, a special department for restoration and conservation (\"Institut für Kunsttechnik und Konservierung\") and an educational center. The museum also administrates the Collection of Children's Toys at St. Lorenz's parish, the Museum of the Emperor's Castle at Nuremberg Castle, as well as the , a Manor house located north of Nuremberg with its collection of hunting weapons and tools. The museum is organized as a public foundation since 1921. Since 2 July 1954, companies and individual persons (the \"\"Fördererkreis\"\") are invited to support the museum's activities.\n\nAs a research institute, the GNM conducts scientific and historical research on the material provided in the collections and archives.

Steinway, was a businessman and civic leader who was influential in the development of Astoria, New York City.\n\nSteinway was born in Seesen, Brunswick, Germany, the fourth son of Henry Engelhard Steinway. In Germany, he received an elementary education and was also given instruction in languages and music. He then became an apprentice in a piano factory, where he spent two years.\n\nHe came to the United States with his father and brothers in 1850. With his father and his brothers Charles and Henry, he founded the firm of Steinway & Sons in 1853. In 1876, he became the official head of the firm, after he had done the decisions factually since 1871 when his father died, and in regard of representation since 1860 when he was the speaker to inaugurate the new plant at 4th Avenue/52nd Street, New York City. In 1866, Steinway erected Steinway Hall to make a place for the exhibition of the highest musical skill. It was a huge success for the company. He also founded the Steinway Concert & Artist department, which is still working today.\n\nIn 1870, William began building a company town, Steinway Village, on in northern Astoria, New York. Avoiding the crowded streets and labor problems associated with operating in Manhattan, he directed the construction of the Steinway Piano Factory on this land, a large facility still in operation today. Near the factory was housing for his workers, a church, library and kindergarten as well as a public trolley line. In 1929, a resort area which Steinway developed just east of Astoria, in North Beach, was converted into North Beach Airport, later renamed LaGuardia Airport.\n\nHis successor in the company was .\n\nSteinway was devastated by his wife's adultery, according to his personal diaries. Steinway married Regina Roos in Buffalo, New York in April 1861. He was 26 and she 17 and the couple were deeply in love. The marriage lasted 16 years and included a series of affairs which Steinway found personally devastating. Regina was to become pregnant six times – two children were still-born and a third miscarried. One son was illegitimate and moved with his mother to France when she divorced in 1876. Steinway later happily remarried.\n\nSteinway also became involved in Daimler AG's first venture into American markets. Through his connections with designer and Daimler confidant Wilhelm Maybach, Steinway met Gottlieb Daimler during a stay in Germany in 1888. Their conversations would invariably revolve around one subject: production of Daimler engines in America. Steinway, like Daimler, quite rightly believed these was a bright future for the internal combustion engine and automobile. After William Steinway returned to America, plans quickly materialized. On September 29, 1888, Daimler Motor Company of New York was founded and initially produced gas and petroleum engines for stationary and marine applications. Steinway and Daimler also started seriously considering the production of automobiles in America, as shipping costs and custom duties prevented importation of highly-coveted \"old-world\" automobiles. From 1892 until ca. 1896/97 the \"American Daimler\" was produced in the premises of the Steinway Astoria plant, full copies of the German cars.\n\nFollowing Steinway's early death in 1896, his heirs weren't convinced about the project and sold all their shares to the General Electric Company in 1898. The factory was renamed Daimler Manufacturing Company. Nonetheless, the hand polished wood inside the Daimler AG company's luxury top brand cars named Maybach is still () made by Steinway's factory in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nDuring the 1890s, Steinway began a project to extend his company town's horse-drawn trolley line under the East River and into midtown Manhattan. This project would eventually lead to the IRT Flushing Line. Although he died before the completion of the project, the tunnels that were dug under the East River were named the Steinway Tunnels after him. The dirt removed from the tunnels was formed into a small island in the middle of the East River, now called U Thant Island. Steinway served as head of the New York Subway Commission, the group that planned the New York City Subway network.\n\nWilliam Steinway died on November 30, 1896, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.\n\nMain Street in Astoria has been renamed Steinway Street in his honor, and today a station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line ( trains) is named Steinway Street.\n\nThe Smithsonian's National Museum of American History launched an online edition of \"The William Steinway Diary\" in December 2010 to coincide with a special display of the diary. The exhibition, titled, \"A Gateway to the 19th Century: The William Steinway Diary, 1861–1896,\" was on view in the Albert H. Small Documents Gallery from Dec. 17, 2010 through April 8, 2011. In the diaries, Steinway documented more than 36 years of his life through near-daily notes in nine volumes and some 2,500 pages, beginning eight days after the first shots of the Civil War were fired and three days before his wedding. The exhibition of the diary included select diary passages, Steinway family photographs, maps and advertisements, and documentation of his role in the creation of the New York City subway and the company town of Steinway in Queens, N.Y.\n\nRecognizing the diary's historical significance, the late Henry Ziegler Steinway, Steinway's grandson and former president of Steinway & Sons, donated the diary to the museum in 1996. A complete transcription of the diary alongside high-resolution scans of each handwritten page are available on \"The William Steinway Diary\" website from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The site provides a detailed look at Steinway's firsthand account of the period's financial panics, labor unrest and rise of the German immigrant class. Primary source material is contextualized with more than 100 images from Steinway family archives and related essays.\n\n\n"}

At different times these were made up of sailors, disciplinary companies, marine infantry, free companies and detachments from metropolitan units. The Spanish Army of Africa can be said to have originated as a permanent institution with the establishment in 1893 of the \"Regimiento de África N° 1\" (1st African Infantry Regiment).\n\nFollowing the Melilla Campaign of 1909–10 Spain began expanding inland from its established coastal holdings and a force of Policia Indigena (Native Police) was created with Moroccan personnel. This indigenous force provided the basis for the establishment in 1911 of the Regulares - Moroccan infantry and cavalry units with Spanish officers.\n\nThe Spanish Army of Africa included an indigenous light infantry force under European officers, designated as the \"Tiradores de Ifni\". In existence from 1934 to 1969, this corps was modelled on the North African tirailleurs of the French Army.\n\nThe Spanish Legion was formed by royal decree of King Alfonso XIII on 28 January 1920 as the Regiment of Foreigners. \"El Tercio\" was modeled on the French Foreign Legion. Its purpose was to provide a corps of professional troops to fight in Spain's colonial campaigns in North Africa in place of conscript units that were proving ineffective. The initial make-up of the regiment was that of a headquarters unit and three battalions known as \"Banderas\" (\"banners\") - an archaic 16th-century term.\n\nBy the Rif War of the 1920s, the Army of Africa was composed in essence of the Spanish Legion and the Regulares; plus \"cazadores\" (Spanish infantry), artillery, engineers and support units. In total it numbered 30,000 soldiers and was the most professional and effective fighting force in the 100,000-man Spanish Army during the 1920s and 30s. Indigenous infantry recruited in the enclave of Ifni (\"Tiradores de Ifni\") from 1934 on, were also considered part of the Army of Africa. A locally recruited gendarmerie, the \"Mehalas de la Mehalla' Jalifiana\", numbering about 5,000 men and modeled on the Moroccan Goumiers attached to the French Army of Africa, was established in 1923 and provided support to the regular units of the Army of Africa. \n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Rif War, the garrison of Spanish Morocco was reduced to the units listed above; plus seven infantry battalions, six cavalry squadrons and six artillery batteries from mainland Spain assigned to African service on a rotation basis.\n\nThe Army of Africa was to play a key part during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. Along with other units in the Spanish Army, the Army of Africa rose against the Second Spanish Republic and took part in the Spanish coup of July 1936 on the side of the \"Nacionales\". On 18 July 1936, General Francisco Franco assumed the supreme command over this force.\n\nSpanish Morocco fell to the rebels without significant opposition. The initial intention was to transport the Army of Africa to mainland Spain by sea. However the crews of the majority of ships in the Spanish Navy had remained loyal to the Republican government in Madrid, overwhelming the officers who had joined the rising. Between 29 July and 5 August 1936 1,500 members of the Army of Africa were accordingly transported to mainland Spain in a bold airlift led by Junkers transport planes supplied by Nazi Germany. The fascist régime of the Kingdom of Italy provided Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers to provide air cover for merchant ships carrying 3,000 soldiers and equipment from Morocco on 5 August. Thereafter daily flights continued until about 8,000 Moroccans and legionaries, with supporting artillery, were gathered at Seville.\n\nAfter landing in Spain, the Army of Africa was split into two columns, one commanded by General Juan Yagüe and the other commanded by Colonel José Enrique Varela. Yagüe's force advanced north, making remarkably rapid gains, and then turned north-eastwards towards Madrid and Toledo. Varela's force entered Andalusia and took control of the key cities of Seville, Granada, and Córdoba. Thanks mostly to the Army of Africa's advances, almost all of western Spain was in Francoist Nationalist hands by the end of September 1936. By early 1937 the Army of Africa's strength had been increased to 60,000 men. The Legion and Regulares spearheaded the \"Nacionales\" operations for the remainder of the war and played a central role in the Nationalist victory.\n\nWith the ending of the Civil War the Army of Africa was reduced to a peacetime establishment. However under Franco it was accorded a higher profile in Spain itself than had been the case under either monarchy or republic. During the 1940s detachments from the \"Tiradores de Ifni\" garrisoned the Canary Islands, while a mounted \"Guardia Mora\" (\"Moorish Guard\") undertook ceremonial duties in Madrid.\n\nFollowing Moroccan independence in 1956 the bulk of the locally recruited Regulares were transferred to the new Royal Moroccan Army. The cities of Melilla and Ceuta, and the lesser plazas de soberanía as well, remained Spanish and are still garrisoned by Legion and Regulares units.\n\nIfni remained under Spanish administration until June 1969. However widespread disturbances in the territory in 1956 and the Ifni War of 1957-58 led to substantial desertions amongst the indigenous rank and file of the \"Tiradores de Ifni\". Accordingly, the four tabors which made up this force underwent a process of \"europeanisation\" in which the majority of their personnel were recruited from Spain itself.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204067", "title": "Nicholas Winton", "text": "Nicholas Winton\n\nSir Nicholas George Winton (né Wertheim; 19 May 1909 – 1 July 2015) was a British humanitarian who established an organisation to rescue children at risk from Nazi Germany. Born to German-Jewish parents who had emigrated to Britain at the beginning of the 20th century, Winton supervised the rescue of 669 children, most of them Jewish, from Czechoslovakia on the eve of World War II. Winton found homes for the children and arranged for their safe passage to Britain.\nThis operation was later known as the Czech \"\" (German for \"children's transport\").\n\nHis work went unnoticed by the world for nearly 50 years, until 1988 when he was invited to the BBC television programme \"That's Life!\", where he was reunited with several of the children he had saved. The British press celebrated him and dubbed him the \"British Schindler.\" In 2003, Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for \"services to humanity, in saving Jewish children from Nazi Germany occupied Czechoslovakia\". On 28 October 2014, he was awarded the highest honour of the Czech Republic, the Order of the White Lion (1st class), by Czech President Miloš Zeman. He died in 2015 at the age of 106.\n\nWinton was born on 19 May 1909 in Hampstead, London to Jewish parents Rudolph Wertheim (18811937), a bank manager, and his wife Barbara ( Wertheimer, 18881978), as the middle-born of their three children. His elder sister was Charlotte (1908–2001) and the younger brother, Robert (1914–2009). His parents were German Jews who had moved to London two years earlier. The family name was Wertheim, but they changed it to Winton in an effort at integration. They also converted to Christianity, and Winton was baptised.\n\nIn 1923, Winton entered Stowe School, which had just opened. He left without qualifications, attending night school while volunteering at the Midland Bank. He then went to Hamburg, where he worked at Behrens Bank, followed by Wasserman Bank in Berlin. In 1931, he moved to France and worked for the Banque Nationale de Crédit in Paris. He also earned a banking qualification in France. Returning to London, he became a broker at the London Stock Exchange. Though a stockbroker, Winton was also \"an ardent socialist who became close to Labour Party luminaries Aneurin Bevan, Jennie Lee and Tom Driberg.\" Through another socialist friend, Martin Blake, Winton became part of a left-wing circle opposed to appeasement and concerned about the dangers posed by the Nazis.\n\nAt school, he had become an outstanding fencer and was selected for the British team in 1938. He had hoped to compete in the following Olympics, but the games were cancelled because of the war.\n\nShortly before Christmas 1938, Winton was planning to travel to Switzerland for a skiing holiday. He decided instead to visit Prague and help Martin Blake, who was in Prague as an associate of the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, then in the process of being occupied by Germany, and had called Winton to ask him to assist in Jewish welfare work. Winton established an organisation to aid children from Jewish families at risk from the Nazis. He set up his office at a dining room table in his hotel in Wenceslas Square. In November 1938, following \"Kristallnacht\" in Nazi-ruled Germany, the House of Commons approved a measure to allow the entry into Britain of refugees younger than 17, provided they had a place to stay and a warranty of £50 was deposited for their eventual return to their own country.\n\nAn important obstacle was getting official permission to cross into the Netherlands, as the children were to embark on the ferry at Hook of Holland. After \"Kristallnacht\" in November 1938, the Dutch government officially closed its borders to any Jewish refugees. The Dutch police, the \"marechaussee\", searched for them and returned any found to Germany, despite the horrors of \"Kristallnacht\" being well known.\n\nWinton succeeded, thanks to the guarantees he had obtained from Britain. After the first train, the process of crossing the Netherlands went smoothly. Winton ultimately found homes in Britain for 669 children, many of whose parents would perish in the Auschwitz concentration camp. His mother worked with him to place the children in homes and later hostels. Throughout the summer of 1939, he placed photographs of the children in \"Picture Post\" seeking families to accept them. By coincidence, the names of the London and North Eastern Railway steamers which operated the Harwich to Hook of Holland route included the \"Prague\" and the \"Vienna\"; the former can be seen in a 1938 Pathé newsreel.\n\nHe also wrote to US politicians such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, asking them to take more children. He said that two thousand more might have been saved if they had helped, but only Sweden took any besides those sent to Britain. The last group of 250, scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, were unable to depart. With Hitler's invasion of Poland on the same day, the Second World War had begun. Of the children due to leave on that train, only two survived the war.\n\nWinton acknowledged the vital roles in Prague of Doreen Warriner, Trevor Chadwick, Nicholas Stopford, Beatrice Wellington (born 15 June 1907), Josephine Pike, and Bill Barazetti (1914–2000), who also worked to evacuate children from Europe. Winton was in Prague for only about three weeks before the Nazis occupied the country. He never set foot in Prague Station. He later wrote that \"Chadwick did the more difficult and dangerous work after the Nazis invaded... he deserves all praise\".\n\n\nOf the 669 children saved from the Holocaust through Winton's efforts, more than 370 have never been traced. BBC News suggested in 2015 that they may not know the full story of how they survived the war.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, Winton applied successfully for registration as a conscientious objector and later served with the Red Cross. In 1940, he rescinded his objections and joined the Royal Air Force, Administrative and Special Duties Branch. He was an aircraftman, rising to sergeant by the time he was commissioned on 22 June 1944 as an acting pilot officer on probation.\n\nOn 17 August 1944, he was promoted to pilot officer on probation. He was promoted to the rank of war substantive flying officer on 17 February 1945. He relinquished his commission on 19 May 1954, retaining the honorary rank of flight lieutenant.\n\nAfter the war, Winton worked for the International Refugee Organization and then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Paris, where he met Grete Gjelstrup, a Danish secretary and accountant's daughter. They married in her hometown of Vejle on 31 October 1948.\n\nThe family insisted that their son Robin stay with them rather than be sent to a residential home. Robin's death from meningitis, the day before his sixth birthday, affected Winton greatly and he founded a local support organisation which became Maidenhead Mencap. Winton stood, unsuccessfully, for the town council in 1954; he later found work in the finance departments of various companies.\n\nIt has been reported Winton suppressed his humanitarian exploits for many years; however, he mentioned them in his election material while unsuccessfully standing for election to the Maidenhead town council in 1954. His rescue achievements went unnoticed for half a century until in 1988 his wife found a detailed scrapbook in their attic, containing lists of the children, including their parents' names and the names and addresses of the families that took them in. She gave the scrapbook to Elisabeth Maxwell, a Holocaust researcher and wife of media magnate Robert Maxwell. Winton himself could not remember the reason why this was done. Letters were sent to each of these known addresses and 80 of \"Winton's children\" were found in Britain.\n\nIn an interview on the BBC radio programme \"The Life Scientific\", Simon Wessely described how his father Rudi, one of the rescued children, had a chance encounter with Winton.\n\nThe wider world found out about his work in February 1988 during an episode of the BBC television programme \"That's Life!\" when he was invited as a member of the audience. At one point, Winton's scrapbook was shown and his achievements were explained. The host of the programme, Esther Rantzen, asked whether anybody in the audience owed their lives to Winton, and if so, to stand: more than two dozen people surrounding Winton rose and applauded. Ms Rantzen then asked if anyone present was the child or grandchild of one of the children Winton saved. The rest of the audience stood.\n\nTo celebrate his 100th birthday, Winton flew over the White Waltham Airfield in a microlight piloted by Judy Leden, the daughter of one of the boys he saved. His birthday was also marked by the publication of a profile in \"The Jewish Chronicle\".\n\nWinton died in his sleep on the morning of 1 July 2015 at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough from cardio-respiratory failure, having been admitted a week earlier following a deterioration in his health. He was 106 years old. Winton was survived by his son, Nicholas, and his daughter, Barbara.\n\nWinton's death came 76 years to the day after 241 of the children he saved left Prague on a train. A special report from the BBC News on several of the children whom Winton rescued during the war had been published earlier that day.\n\nIn the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours, Winton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield homes for the elderly in Britain, and in the 2003 New Year Honours, he was knighted for services to humanity, in recognition of his work on the Czech \"Kindertransport\". He met the Queen again during her state visit to Bratislava, Slovakia, in October 2008. In 2003, Winton received the Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2010, Winton was named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government.\n\nWinton was awarded the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, Fourth Class, by the Czech President Václav Havel in 1998. In 2008, he was honoured by the Czech government in several ways. An elementary school in Kunžak is named after him, and he was awarded the Cross of Merit of the Minister of Defence, Grade I. The Czech government nominated him for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe minor planet 19384 Winton was named in his honour by Czech astronomers Jana Tichá and Miloš Tichý.\nA statue of Winton stands on Platform 1 of the Praha hlavní nádraží railway station. Created by Flor Kent, it was unveiled on 1 September 2009 as part of a larger commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the last \"Kindertransport\" train (see also \"Winton train\", below).\n\nThere are also three memorials at Liverpool Street Station in London, where the \"Kindertransport\" children arrived. In September 2010, another statue of Winton was unveiled, this time at Maidenhead railway station by Home Secretary Theresa May, MP for Maidenhead. Created by Lydia Karpinska, it depicts Winton sitting on a bench and reading a book.\n\nWinton was baptised as a Christian by his parents, but his Jewish ancestry disqualified him from being declared a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Israel. As an adult, he was not active in any particular religion. In a 2015 interview, Winton told Stephen Sackur he had become disillusioned with religion during the war as he could not reconcile religious movements \"praying for victory on both sides of the same war\". Winton went on to describe his personal beliefs: \"I believe in ethics, and if everybody believed in ethics we'd have no problems at all. That's the only way out; forget the religious side.\"\n\nWinton received the Wallenberg Medal on 27 June 2013 in London. The following year, the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation established a literary competition named after Winton. The contest is for essays by high school students about Winton's legacy.\n\nWinton was awarded the Freedom of the City of London on 23 February 2015.\n\nIn 2019 his old school, Stowe, opened a new boys' day house, named Winton.\n\nOn 1 September 2009, a special \"Winton Train\" composed of one or two steam locomotives (out of a set of six) and carriages used in the 1930s set off from the Prague Main railway station for London via the original Kindertransport route. On board were several surviving \"Winton children\" and their descendants, who were welcomed by Winton in London. \n\nThe occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the final intended Kindertransport arranged by Winton, due to set off on 1 September 1939 but prevented by the outbreak of the Second World War that very day. At the train's departure, a memorial statue for Winton, designed by Flor Kent, was unveiled at the railway station.\n\nOn 19 May 2014, Winton's 105th birthday, it was announced he was to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, for giving Czech children \"the greatest possible gift: the chance to live and to be free\". On 28 October 2014, Winton was awarded the Order of the White Lion (Class I) by Czech President Miloš Zeman, the Czech Defence Ministry having sent a special aircraft to bring him to Prague. The award was made alongside one to Sir Winston Churchill, which was accepted by his grandson Nicholas Soames. Zeman said he regretted the highest Czech award having been awarded to the two personalities so belatedly, but added \"better late than never\". Winton was also able to meet some of the people he rescued 75 years earlier, themselves then in their 80s. He said, \"I want to thank you all for this enormous expression of thanks for something which happened to me nearly 100 years ago—and a 100 years is a heck of a long time. I am delighted that so many of the children are still about and are here to thank me.\"\n\n\nWinton's work is the subject of three films by Slovak filmmaker Matej Mináč: the drama \"All My Loved Ones\" (1999), in which Winton was played by Rupert Graves, the documentary \"\" (\"Síla lidskosti—Nicholas Winton\", 2002), which won an Emmy Award, and the documentary drama \"Nicky's Family\" (\"Nickyho rodina\", 2011). A play about Winton, \"Numbers from Prague\", was performed in Cambridge in January 2011.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme, on 28 October 2014, Winton said he thought he had \"made a difference to a lot of people\" and went on to say, \"I don't think we've learned anything… the world today is in a more dangerous situation than it has ever been.\"\n\nOn 19 May 2020, Google honoured Winton's legacy and celebrated what would have been his 111th birthday with a doodle.\n\nOn 22 April 2016, a remembrance quarter peal was rung and a new method named \"Sir Nicholas Winton Delight\" by bellringers of the Whiting Society of Ringers. On 19 May 2016, a memorial service for Winton was held at London's Guildhall, attended by some 400 people, including 28 of those he saved, and Czech, Slovak and UK government representatives. On 20 May 2016, military charity Glen Art presented a memorial concert celebrating Winton's life with Jason Isaacs, Rupert Graves and Alexander Baillie, at St John's, Smith Square. All funds donated were given to charities supporting Syrian refugee children. On 14 July 2017, a memorial garden for Winton was opened in Maidenhead Oaken Grove park by Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\n\n\n"}

Both \"Calliope\" and her sister ship were based on the earlier cruiser . They were effectively test ships for the use of geared turbines which resulted in the one less funnel. They also received slightly thicker armour. They led into the first of the \"Cambrian\" subclass.\n\nEight light cruisers were ordered for the Royal Navy in the 1913 budget. The six ships of the \"Caroline\" class used conventional direct drive turbine engines but \"Calliope\" and \"Caroline\" each had a different engine design using geared reduction to match optimum working speeds of turbines and propellers. This followed experimental designs ordered in 1911 using geared high pressure turbines for the destroyers and and in 1912 using gearing for both high pressure and low pressure turbines in destroyers and .\n\n\"Calliope\" was built at HM Dockyard, Chatham, Kent. She was laid down in January 1914, launched on 17 December 1914, and completed in June 1915.\n\n\"Calliope\" had four shafts as used in the \"Caroline\" design but unlike the two used in \"Champion\". Gearing increased the efficiency of power transmission to the water so allowed smaller boilers and turbines to be used than otherwise would be the case. Nominal design power for the same target speed was therefore reduced from 40,000 shp in the \"Caroline\" class to 37,500 shp. Propeller speed was 480 rpm.\n\nCommissioned in June 1915, \"Calliope\" was assigned to the Grand Fleet for service as flagship of the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron. She was badly damaged by a fuel oil fire in her boiler room while at sea on 19 March 1916, but was repaired in time to be one of the five ships in the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May-1 June 1916. Under the command of Commodore Charles E. Le Mesurier, HMS Calliope received a number of hits just before nightfall on 31 May (notably by the German battleships and ), and 10 of her crew were killed.\n\nIn September 1917, \"Calliope\" helped to sink four German trawler minesweepers in the North Sea off the coast of Jutland.\n\nIn March 1919, \"Calliope\" was commissioned for service with the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station where she suffered with another engine room fire in the Atlantic Ocean off the Azores in October 1919. She returned to Devonport for repairs, which were carried out between November 1919 and March 1920, and then recommissioned for continued service on the North America and West Indies Station. She returned to the United Kingdom in December 1920 for a refit and paid off at the Nore in January 1921. She was in the Nore Reserve from October 1921 to May 1924, when she was commissioned for service with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in the Atlantic Fleet.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1926, \"Calliope\" was used to transport troops before paying off into dockyard control at the Nore in April 1926 for a refit. Between 1927 and 1928 she was used for trooping runs again, becoming the Senior Naval Officer's ship in the Nore Reserve in December 1927. In September 1928 received her last commission, this time with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet, which ended in January 1930 when she paid off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard.\n\n\"Calliope\" was transferred to dockyard control in January 1931. She was sold for scrap on 28 August 1931 to Thos W Ward of Inverkeithing, Scotland.\n\n\"Calliope\" received one battle honour, for the Battle of Jutland in 1916.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204075", "title": "Slightly Odway", "text": "Slightly Odway\n\nSlightly Odway is the debut studio album by Australian alternative rock band Jebediah. It was recorded between March and May 1997 at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne, with Neill King producing. \"Slightly Odway\" was released on 8 September 1997 by record label Murmur.\n\nIt peaked at number 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and appeared in the top 50 for non-consecutive runs totalling 54 weeks.\n\nThe group's line-up of Chris Daymond on lead guitar, Kevin Mitchell on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Vanessa Thornton on bass guitar and Kevin's older brother, Brett Mitchell, on drums started recording \"Slightly Odway\" in March 1997 with United Kingdom's Neill King (The Smiths, Madness, Elvis Costello) producing.\n\nAccording to Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll, the title \"is a comment on the slightly odd way they feel they approach life as well as music\".\n\nIn March 2002 Kevin reflected on his song writing \"It didn't bother me that people didn't pick up on the lyrics. I'd made a conscious effort to focus on lyrics, because there were some lyrics on \"Slightly Odway\" that I was a little embarrassed about, ones where I hadn't really been trying. But I certainly didn't want vindication or attention for what I'd written.\"\n\nThe bowling green on the artwork of the album is the Kardinya Bowling Club, where bass player Vanessa Thornton's grandparents played. The spaceship is in fact a Futuro house that was located on the corner of Leach Highway and Karel Avenue in Willetton, close to where the band members grew up. The structure was used as part of a sales office for a nearby residential subdivision and was removed in 1996, after being donated to the Barking Gecko Theatre Company.\n\nJebediah had issued a single version of \"Jerks of Attention\" on 8 December 1996, which was produced by Lindsay Gravina, and charted on the ARIA Singles Chart in 1997. Jedediah and King re-recorded \"Jerks of Attention\" for the album.\n\nThe vinyl version of \"Slightly Odway\" contains a version of \"Tracksuit\" (originally on their debut extended play, \"Twitch\", August 1996), re-recorded with the album's producer Neill King. The Asian version of \"Slightly Odway\", released in 1998, also contains \"Tracksuit\" and \"Monument\" (a B-side from \"Leaving Home\", June 1997), as well as a printed copy of the lyrics.\n\n\"Slightly Odway\" was released on 8 September 1997, which peaked at number seven on the ARIA Albums Chart, and number two on the ARIA alternative charts. Within four months it was certified gold, then platinum and eventually went double-platinum.\n\nKevin Mitchell stated in a 2012 interview with X-Press magazine that, to the surprise of numerous people, none of the singles from the album received commercial radio airplay. Despite this the single, \"Jerks of Attention\", which was released in December 1996, reached number 62 on the ARIA Singles Charts. The second single, \"Leaving Home\", released on 27 June 1997, reached number 48 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and was ranked number 10 in the Triple J Hottest 100 music poll for 1997.\n\nThe third single, \"Military Strongmen\", released on 11 October 1997, peaked at No. 65 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The fourth and fifth singles, \"Teflon\" and \"Harpoon\", released on 23 March 1998 and 22 June 1998 reached number 41 and number 46 respectively on the ARIA Singles Chart.\n\nIn his retrospective review, Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic wrote that \"Slightly Odway\" \"shows Jebediah as a talented young band, despite the flimsy songwriting and the lack of light and shade on the album. Once Jebediah learn they don't need to bludgeon the audience with their guitar-playing they will be better off for it.\" Lewis preferred the earlier version of \"Jerks of Attention\", which is \"one of their finest songs\", over the album version, which was \"a half-paced version of the original single: it certainly doesn't improve it.\"\n\nIn May 2011 Matt Neal of \"The Warrnambool Standard\" felt the album was \"packed with big power chords, frontman Kevin \"Bob Evans\" Mitchell's distinctive sing-through-your-nose approach, inspired bursts of guitar noise and a love of crowd-friendly melodies. Some of it hasn't aged well\".\n\nThe album placed at number 15 in a list of the greatest 100 Australian albums compiled by Australian youth radio station Triple J.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204084", "title": "Wilshire Boulevard", "text": "Wilshire Boulevard\n\nWilshire Boulevard is one of the principal east-west arterial roads in the Los Angeles area of Southern California, extending from Ocean Avenue in the city of Santa Monica east to Grand Avenue in the Financial District of downtown Los Angeles. It is also one of the major city streets through the city of Beverly Hills. Wilshire Boulevard runs roughly parallel with Santa Monica Boulevard from Santa Monica to the west boundary of Beverly Hills. From the east boundary it runs a block south of Sixth Street to its terminus.\n\nWilshire Boulevard is densely developed throughout most of its span, connecting Beverly Hills with five of Los Angeles's major business districts to each other. Many of the post-1956 skyscrapers in Los Angeles are located along Wilshire; for example, the Wilshire Grand Center, which is the tallest building in California, is located on the Figueroa and Wilshire intersection. One Wilshire, built in 1966 at the junction of Wilshire and Grand, is said to be \"...the main hub of the internet for the entire Pacific Rim\" due to the large concentration of telecommunications companies renting space there. Aon Center, at one point Los Angeles' largest (and presently third-largest) tower, is at 707 Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nOne particularly famous stretch of the boulevard between Fairfax and Highland Avenues is known as the Miracle Mile. Many of Los Angeles' largest museums are located there. The area just to the east, between Highland Avenue and Wilton Place, is referred to as the \"Park Mile\". Between Westwood and Holmby Hills, several tall glitzy condominium buildings overlook this part of Wilshire, giving it the title of \"Millionaire's Mile\". This section is also known as the Wilshire Corridor and Condo Canyon.\n\nThe Wilshire Corridor, located next to Century City, is one of Los Angeles' busiest districts, and contains many high-rise residential towers. The Fox and MGM studios are located in a series of skyscrapers, along with many historic Los Angeles hotels.\n\nWilshire Boulevard is also the principal street of Koreatown, the site of many of Los Angeles' oldest buildings, as well as skyscrapers. Koreatown and Mid-Wilshire are among Los Angeles' most densely populated districts.\n\nWilshire Boulevard originated as one of the central pathways constructed by the Tongva Aztec tribes residing in the region prior to the exploration of the conquistadores. At the time of the founding of Los Angeles, Wilshire Boulevard was one of the main arteries connecting the largest Tongva city in the area, then known as Yaanga, which eventually become Union Station, to the Pacific Ocean. \n\nFrom the founding of Los Angeles through nearly all of the 1800s, Wilshire Boulevard was known as \"Calle de los Indios.\" \n\nBefore the Spanish settlements of Los Angeles, much of the length of Wilshire Boulevard can be traced back to the indigenous Tongva people who used it to bring back tar from the La Brea pits in today's Miracle Mile section of Wilshire Blvd, back to their settlement on the coast. This road was later used by Spanish explorers and settlers, calling it El Camino Viejo ('The Old Road'). The route that ultimately became Wilshire crossed the original pueblo of Los Angeles and five of the original Spanish land grants, or \"ranchos\".\n\nWilshire was pieced together from various streets over several decades. It began in the 1870s as Nevada Avenue in Santa Monica, and in the 1880s as Orange Street between Westlake (now MacArthur) Park and downtown. Nevada and Orange were later renamed as parts of Wilshire.\n\nIn 1895, Calle de los Indios was renamed \"Wilshire Boulevard\" by Henry Gaylord Wilshire (1861–1927), an Ohio native from Cincinnati, Ohio, who made and lost fortunes in real estate, farming, and gold mining. In 1895 he began developing of a barley field, stretching westward from Westlake Park for an elite residential subdivision, and donated to the city a strip of land wide by long for a boulevard, on the conditions that it would be named for him and that railroad lines and commercial or industrial trucking would be banned. The road first appeared on a map under its present name in 1895. A historic apartment building on the corner of Wilshire Blvd. and S. Kenmore Ave., the Gaylord, carries his middle name.\n\nThe Wilshire Boulevard home of J. Paul Getty was used as the filmset for the 1950 film \"Sunset Boulevard\": it was demolished in 1957.\n\nThe Purple and Red subway lines of the Los Angeles Metro run along Wilshire Boulevard from just past the 7th/Figueroa Street station before serving the Westlake/MacArthur Park and Wilshire/Vermont stations, where the Purple Line continues along Wilshire to serve two stations at Normandie Avenue and at Western Avenue in Koreatown, while the Red Line branches off to terminate in North Hollywood.\n\nThe construction of the future Purple Line extension along Wilshire Boulevard commenced in November 2014. The construction timeline would see the project from the existing Wilshire/Western station to the planned Wilshire/La Cienega station on the corner of Wilshire and La Cienega Boulevard, to be completed by 2023. The second phase got officially under way on February 23, 2018 from Wilshire/La Cienega to Century City Station. Phase three of the Purple Line extension, when fully completed, will extend to UCLA and Westwood/VA Hospital, and will follow Wilshire Boulevard for most of its route. Phase four to downtown Santa Monica is still in the planning stages and has no funding.\n\nMetro Local Line 20, Metro Rapid Line 720, and Santa Monica Transit Line 2 operate along Wilshire Boulevard. Due to the high ridership of line 720, NABI articulated buses are used on this route, and bus lanes are in place along some segments of the line.\n\nAll of the boulevard is at least four lanes in width, and most of the portion between Hoover Street and Robertson Boulevard has a raised center median. The widest portion is in the business district of central Westwood, where mobs of pedestrians crossing Wilshire at Westwood Boulevard must traverse ten lanes (including two left-turn pockets). According to a 1991 study by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, this and the nearby intersection of Wilshire and Veteran are among the busiest in Los Angeles. The boulevard's widest portion is in Westwood and Holmby Hills, where it expands to six, and briefly, eight lanes.\n\nThe sections of Wilshire Boulevard in the city of Los Angeles are notorious for their giant potholes.\n\nWilshire Boulevard formerly ended at the MacArthur Park lake, but in 1934 a berm was built for it to cross and link up with the existing Orange Street (which ran from Figueroa to Alvarado) into downtown Los Angeles. Orange Street was renamed Wilshire and extended east of Figueroa to Grand. This divided the lake into two halves; the northern half was later drained.\n\nWilshire Boulevard runs through or near the following:\n\n\n\nThe entire route is in Los Angeles County.\n\nAmerican singer Lana Del Rey mentions Wilshire Boulevard in the song \"Honeymoon\" on her 2015 album of the same name, as well as American Rapper Nipsey Hussle, in the song \"Dreamin'\" on his fifth mixtape titled \"The Marathon\".\nThe 1997 film \"Volcano\" features the boulevard being destroyed by volcanic lava.\nOn March 9, 1997, American East Coast rapper The Notorious B.I.G. was seated in the front passenger seat of an SUV, which came to a stop at the red light at the intersection of Wilshire and Fairfax. Another vehicle pulled up next to them, and the driver drew out a pistol and shot B.I.G. four times in a drive-by shooting, killing him.\n\n\n\n"}

His father Edward was a tailor and a shirt-maker.\n\nA graduate of Boston Latin School and Boston University, he began his career as a disc jockey. His first radio job, c. 1947, was at WHEB in Portsmouth NH. In 1948 he joined WHDH, and in October 1950, he became program director at station WORL. He briefly worked in New York at WNEW, before relocating to WBZ radio in late 1955; in 1956, he became one of the \"Live Five\" after WBZ dropped its syndicated NBC programming and went on the air with live disc jockeys.

It is the world's largest baking company and operates the largest bakeries in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Chile, Peru, Colombia, El Salvador and Spain, and has some of the widest distribution networks in Mexico and the United States. It was also the ninth largest company of Mexico by revenues in 2013.\n\nBimbo reported revenues of US$14.1 billion for 2014. It has more than 138,000 employees, 165 manufacturing plants and 2.5 million sales centers located in 32 countries in America, Europe and Asia. It operates more than 100 trademarks, among which are Entenmann's, Bimbo, Tia Rosa, Marinela, Wonder Bread (in Mexico only), Barcel, Sara Lee, Mrs Baird's, Stroehmann, Ball Park buns, Oroweat and Arnold Bread. Bimbo has one of the widest distribution networks in the world, surpassing 52,000 routes Bimbo operates under a scheme of recurrent sales channels views, making three daily visits to the same establishment.\n\nBimbo has been listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange since 1980 and is a constituent of the IPC, the main benchmark index of Mexican stocks. In 2016, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Grupo Bimbo at #986 on the Forbes Global 2000, an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world.\n\nThe company Grupo Bimbo was started in Mexico in 1945 by Lorenzo Servitje, José T. Mata, Jaime Sendra, Jaime Jorba and Alfonso Velasco. Over fifteen years, under the leadership of Daniel Servitje, current Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Group, it has established itself as a global bakery company, reporting an increase in sales of US$4.67 billion in 2004 to US$10.712 billion, in 2011.\n\nThe first products launched into the market were cellophane-wrapped large and small white loaves of bread, rye bread and toasted bread. By late 1948, there were nine Bimbo products on the market. The line was expanded in 1952 with the production of the Donas del Osito (Bear Cub Doughnuts) started, along with a new line of buns: Bimbollos, Medias Noches and Colchones.\n\nIn 1949 the first depot outside Mexico City was inaugurated in the city of Puebla. In 1956, the Bimbo Occidente plant in Guadalajara started operations, with Roberto Servitje as its first General Manager. Four years later the Bimbo del Norte plant was inaugurated in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León.\n\nAfter an administrative restructure and the launch of successful products such as Gansito and Submarinos Marinela, in 1972 the company installed the largest bakery in Latin America and one of the ten largest in the world, in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City.\n\nWith an important growth in the products and brands portfolio, such as Barcel, Marinela, Tía Rosa, Ricolino and Suandy, Don Roberto Servitje was appointed as CEO of Grupo Bimbo in 1979. A year later, the company started trading 15% of its shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV).\n\nIn 1984, the company started its expansion by exporting to the United States. Two years later, the company created a new organizational structure, known as Grupo Bimbo till today.\n\nLater, in 1989, Bimbo Central America was created with the opening of a plant in Guatemala. Two years later with the addition of Bimbo Argentina, the Latin America Region Corporate structure was created and in 1995, the company opened two more plants in Chile and in Argentina.\n\nWith the appointment of Daniel Servitje as CEO of the company in 1997, the global growth strategy was strengthened. In 1998 the Group acquired the American bakery Mrs. Baird's, as well as Plus Vita and Pullman in Brazil, in 2001. A year later it acquired the West region baking business of George Weston Limited in the United States.\n\nGrupo Bimbo acquired the Panrico bakery in Beijing in 2007, initiating its presence in the Asian market, expanding its operations in two continents.\n\nOn 2008, Grupo Bimbo bought Nutrella bakery in Brazil and in 2009 bought all of the George Weston Foods Ltd. in the United States, with the brands Arnold, Boboli (premade pizza crusts), Brownberry, Entenmann's, Freihofer's, Stroehmann and Thomas’, plus 22 factories and 4,000 delivery trucks.\n\nDuring 2011, the Group consolidated two acquisitions, becoming the largest baking company in the world. In September, Grupo Bimbo bought Fargo in Argentina, while in October, it closed on the acquisition of Sara Lee's operations in Spain and Portugal, renaming the unit Bimbo Iberia. Thus the company managed to unify the Bimbo brand that operated independently in both countries.\n\nShortly after, in February 2014, Grupo Bimbo announced the acquisition of Canada Bread. The transaction, valued at C$1.83 billion, enabled the Group to reaffirm its position as the world's leading baking company by extending its distribution in North America and entering the market of United Kingdom, this last one through the New York Bakery Co. brand, a leading manufacturer of bagels in Europe. In the same year, the company acquired Supan, a baking company in Ecuador, an operation that led the company to reinforce its presence in America and the world.\n\nIn June 2015, Bimbo was being considered as a possible buyer of Hostess Brands, the manufacturer of \"Twinkies\" valued at US$2 billion. However, a month later Hostess Brands' owners cancelled its plans to sell the company after failing to receive any offers.\n\n\nBimbo's Management Council is organized as follows:\n\n\nBimbo has several brands, which vary from country to country.\nThe name Bimbo was first coined in 1945. The main hypothesis is that it resulted from the combination of Bingo and the Disney film Bambi. Later, the founders discovered that children in Italian are called bimbo, while in Hungarian, the word means bud and the phoneme used in China to name it sounds very similar to bread.\n\nThe corporate pet, a small polar bear, resulted from the drawing that came to Mr. Jaime Jorba in a Christmas card, and whom Anita Mata, wife of Jaime Sendra, dressed with a white apron and a chef's hat, given a loaf of bread under his arm. The company has made a few failed attempts to change this mascot with some characters like Gruba, a character from the Olocoons franchise. \n\nThe Bimbo trademark was recognized as \"famous\" by the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property on April 23, 2010 and is one of the 27 selected brands that have reached this category in the country. In 2014, the Brand Footprint by Kantar World Panel positioned it in seventh place in the food industry in the world.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prominent among the Anglo-Métis of the area, he is considered to be the founder of the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nAn interpreter for the Hudson's Bay Company for many years, Isbister was talented linguistically, speaking English, Gaelic, Cree, Dene and Michif.\n\nIsbister began farming in the summer of 1862 one mile east of the present day federal penitentiary at Prince Albert. The area he farmed is close to present day 17 Avenue and 14 Street West. Isbister was probably the first man in what is now known as Saskatchewan to grow wheat on his own farm. He also worked on the John Smith Reserve (currently the Muskoday First Nation) as a farm instructor. By 1866, when Isbister moved a short distance away, several families were living in the district, which was known as Isbister's Settlement.\n\nBy 1884, both settler and Métis discontent was growing rapidly due to poor agricultural conditions and unresolved land issues in the Saskatchewan Valley region. As a community leader, Isbister was selected as one of the four delegates (along with Gabriel Dumont) sent to recall Louis Riel from Montana to lead the people in seeking government action to address the situation. Local settlers' perception of government inaction culminated in the Northwest Rebellion of the following year (1885).\n\nLike most other Anglo-Métis of the area, Isbister disassociated himself from the movement led by Riel when tensions ultimately erupted into violence. Despite this, he was denounced by the Conservative press in Prince Albert.\n\nFollowing the Northwest Rebellion, Isbister was active in the Anglican Church of Canada in the Prince Albert area, and lived out his last days in that community. He is buried in the Anglican St. Mary's Cemetery just west of the Penitentiary not far from where he farmed initially.\n\n\n"}

Since then, Yamauchi has fulfilled his dream of creating realistic driving simulators with his massively successful \"Gran Turismo\" series. He has also expressed interest in broadening out to other game genres; in 1999 Polyphony Digital released \"Omega Boost\", a shoot 'em up title set in space, which has since proven to be Yamauchi's only foray outside of racing game development.\n\nAs a result of \"Gran Turismo's\" success, Yamauchi has become an important figure in the worldwide automotive industry. For his help with promoting Volkswagen models in the series, the company gave him a Golf R32.. Polyphony Digital worked with Nissan to design the multifunction display (which relays various pieces of car data to the driver, including G-Force generated, torque distribution and lap times) found in the R35 GT-R. The car, as well as the display itself, appear in many games in his franchise, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, \"Gran Turismo 5,\" Gran Turismo 6 and a newer, facelifted version of the car in Gran Turismo Sport.

It was created on 2 February 1661 for Walter Ernle, later Member of Parliament for Devizes. He died 25 July 1682, and was buried at Bishops Cannings, Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his grandson, Sir Walter Ernle (1672–1690), 2nd Baronet, of Maddington, Wiltshire, who was, in turn, succeeded at his own death by his younger brother, Sir Edward Ernle (1673-1728/9), 3rd Baronet, P.C., MP. The third Baronet was succeeded by a kinsman, Sir Walter Ernle (1676–1732), 4th Baronet, of Conock, in the parish of Chirton, Wiltshire, who died childless, and was succeeded by his younger brother, the Reverend Sir John Ernle (circa 1680/1-1724), 5th Baronet, Rector of All Cannings, Wiltshire, who was predeceased by his only son.\n\nThe title is generally considered to have become extinct on the fifth Baronet's death in 1734. However, it was assumed by the late Baronet's kinsman Sir Michael Ernle (circa 1704–1771), a descendant of the first Baronet's younger brother. He also died without issue. The claim was then passed on to his younger brother, The Reverend Sir Edward Ernle (circa 1711/2-1787). Since his death in 1787, the title has not been claimed.\n\nThe Ernle baronets bore the coat-of-arms: Argent, on a bend sable, three eagles displayed or.\n\nThe estates of the family passed through female lines of descendants, and the surname Ernle, pronounced Earnley, after the Sussex parish from which it derived, now forms part of the orotund surname, Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, borne by Admiral The Honourable Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, younger son of the 17th Lord Dunsany whose wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Mary Grosvenor Ernle-Erle-Drax, née Burton, was the eventual heiress of the senior line of the Wiltshire Ernle family. The surname continues among the admiral's descendants, being thus preserved whereas it would otherwise, apparently, have died out in the United Kingdom. No other current bearers of the surname worldwide are known to be related in the male-line to the Wiltshire and Sussex Ernle sib.\n\nA one-name study of the surname Ernle and its many variants, including Erneley and Ernly, is being undertaken by a descendant of an earlier cadet line (descended from Thomas Ernle, gent., of Brembridge or Bremeridge manor, Dilton, parish of Westbury, Wilts., who was buried in Westbury parish church in 1595. He was the second son of John Ernle, Esq., of Burton Priory, Bishops Cannings, Wilts., who died in 1571) of the same Wiltshire family which originated with the mediaeval lords of the manor of Earnley on the Sussex coast.\n\nFor a more extensive account of the Ernle lineage, readers are advised to consult, with caution for their many errors, Burke's Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies, and the entries for the family listed in various editions of Burke's Landed Gentry, indexed by Burke's Family Index. For the baronetcy, the account in the Complete Baronetage should be examined.\n\n\n"}

Currently the school has an enrollment of about 6,000 students per week, 2,700 of them children.\n\nThe Old Town School of Folk Music was originally established by Dawn Greening in her family dining room. \n\nWith her incredible warmth, and skill at building relationships, Greening and her family acted as a support system to a vast community of struggling folk artists. Doc Watson, Pete Seeger and Odetta were among the artists that were always welcome in their home and treated as family.\n\nDuring a time when mothers were expected to act as caretakers and people of color were supposed to enter through the back door as servants, Greening and her family took the brunt of social backlash and exclusion from their neighbors. Yet Greening had the foresight, connections and follow-through required to create a hub for their alternative grass-roots community. She personally coordinated students and teachers to regularly come into her home and experience folk music for what it was; a quilt of tradition and history meant to bring folks from all walks of life together. \n\nWith her support, Win Stracke and Frank Hamilton were able to formally open the school on December 1, 1957.\n\nStracke was a classically trained singer and Hamilton was a young multi-instrumentalist and teacher of folk music; Hamilton had previously studied under Bess Lomax Hawes, daughter of folklorist John Lomax. Stracke and Hamilton met at the Gate of Horn nightclub in Chicago where they were both performing. \n\nComing together with Greening, Hamilton and Stracke developed a classroom technique based upon traditional oral and folk teaching methods: listening, watching, trial and error, and playing by ear. Where other music schools taught sight reading and performance, Greening, Stracke and Hamilton wanted the Old Town School \"method\" to retain its emphasis on participation and development of aural skills.\n\nSeveral of the early faculty at the Old Town School were past members of Win Stracke's the \"I Come For to Sing\" review. A folk review performed by a rotating group of artists, the program was a variety show in which each program revolved around a particular topic, the songs and readings presented would all deal with that topic. Win Stracke, Studs Terkel, Big Bill Broonzy, and Fleming Brown were all members of \"I Come For to Sing\" at different times. The school would also publish a folk magazine by the same name from 1975-1987.\n\nThe initial version of the Old Town School Songbook was an unbound stack of pages to be added to a three ring binder. It was a collection of 94 songs mostly North American in origin, but selections from Israel, Ireland, England, and Chile were added. In keeping with the teaching philosophy of the school it favored lots of songs which were suitable for group involvement. Each page had a short history of the song, the chord progression, rhythm indicators, a transcription of the melody and lyrics for the verses. Chord fingering charts were provided for guitar and banjo.\n\nPete Seeger, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Driftwood, Big Bill Broonzy, and Josh White all performed at the Old Town School in its early years. Early teachers at the school included Chicago blues guitarist Big Bill Broonzy, and banjo players Fleming Brown and Stu Ramsey as well as the Brazilian singer-guitarist Valucha deCastro (a.k.a. Valucha Buffington). The formation and growth of the School coincided with the folk music boom of the 1960s and early 1970s. In Chicago, folk influence was scattered in Hyde Park (site of the Folk Festival), Oak Park (where Greening lived), and Old Town. The school's first location was a rundown storefront at 333 W. North Ave. in Old Town.\n\nThroughout its existence the School has focused on offering both instruction and performance with many performing musicians also acting as teachers and mentors. The School also proved a rich ground for collaboration. The late 1960s were a peak of success as several musicians associated with the School rose to national prominence, including Roger McGuinn of The Byrds, Fred Holstein, John Prine, Steve Goodman, Bonnie Koloc, and Bob Gibson. The school moved into a more permanent home at 909 West Armitage Ave.\n\nEnrollment peaked in 1975 with about 650 students per-week, but as the folk revival declined in the mid-1970s so did the fortunes of the School; although it continued to provide music lessons to hundreds of students the School suffered financial difficulties and was on the brink of bankruptcy in 1981. It was discussed at this time to move the School from its aging facilities on Armitage Avenue to the suburbs.\n\nThe Old Town School of Folk Music (OTSFM), was having a near death experience in the late 1980s.. On revenues of $200,000 per year the school was losing $40,000 per year, with no money in the bank. The school had ceased to be relevant to its markets, and new customers were not being attracted to the school's programming. In order to survive, the school needed to develop a new strategy. So it developed three:\n1. The school could not pay its bills, so one strategy was to reduce costs and raise cash. Goal: Return to net profitability within 12 months.\n2. Develop relevant new products to attract new customers. Goal: Increase revenues by 40% per year through new product offerings.\n3. Raise money to renovate the school's main building at 909 Armitage Ave. and conference hall. Goal: Raise $600,000 over the next 24 months.\n\nA new Executive Director, Jim Hirsch, was hired at the beginning of the turnaround. One member of the Board and Jim reviewed all of the financial numbers and decided what they could control, and where cuts were necessary. Reducing costs involved laying off guitar instructors, who were struggling to make a living as artists. The little that the OTSFM paid them was still a meaningful amount in their lives, but an expense the school had to reduce in order to survive. The layoffs were painful, but amazingly half of the staff agreed to work for free, during the transition. They understood the situation faced by the school. Each creditor, and there were many, to whom the school owed money, was met face-to-face. A plan was offered to pay them; if they could extend a little more credit to the school. \nGrowth takes time to build, but cost reductions can happen (no matter how painful) immediately.\n\nThe school faced several tough choices. The school owned two buildings. It was a painful choice, but the school's board decided to sell one of its buildings, so that bills could be paid and agreements kept.\n\nThe school also needed to look at its programs and concert offerings to the public. Michael Miles was hired to work on the school's programming. If the school wanted to survive over the long term, it needed to offer more exciting products (concerts, lessons, etc.) and draw in a broader, more ethnically diversified customer base. The OTSFM expanded its concert offerings and guitar instruction lessons. A new 'Wiggleworms' program was put together to teach music to little children (under 5 years old), and Jim put together a \"Latin Music Festival\" that was the first such offering in Chicago by a non-Latino institution. This was highlighted in February 1989 by a performance from Jesus \"Chucho\" Rodriguez & Henry Hernandez with their Indian Harp and The Inca Peruvian Highland Wind Ensemble. These programs resulted in a much more ethnically diversified audience and helped with revenue growth.\n\nExecution of the above changes was primarily done by the school's staff. The board (a group of volunteers) took responsibility for raising $600,000 to do the renovation. Just like a good song needs a 'hook' to resonate with a listener, the school needed a 'hook' to interest funding organizations and individual contributors. The school's success with its new products for a diversified audience was a primary reason funding organizations agreed to provide support to the school's capital campaign. \nSince then the school has had a renaissance. Its annual revenues are in excess of several million dollars. It successfully renovated its old building, later a new one was purchased and renovated with money from an even larger capital campaign. The new venue has a larger concert stage and teaching capacity. That new building helped to lead the way for revitalizing a Chicago neighborhood. Currently, the school's concerts and teaching programs are full, and there is a very healthy involvement of volunteers, customers and staff. It impacts more people's lives today than at any time in its past\n\nAfter occupying a building at 909 West Armitage Avenue in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood since 1968, the Old Town School in 1998 expanded into a new and larger main branch in the former Hild Library at 4544 North Lincoln Avenue, with a 400-seat concert hall. The move allowed the school room to expand its music education program significantly.\n\nIn October 2018, the school announced that it would sell its Armitage building to gain endowment money. Teachers and community members blasted the decision for being shortsighted and taken without feedback from the community. The following March, the school announced that it had reconsidered and would not sell the building, instead focusing on increasing enrollment. Meanwhile, the faculty voted to unionize, associating itself with the Illinois Federation of Teachers.\n\nAs of late 2003, Old Town School has occasionally held or sponsored concerts in the 1525-seat Harris Theater for Music and Dance located mostly underground in the downtown Millennium Park.\n\nToday, the Old Town School continues to offer music, dance, art and theater classes and performances for adults and children at both locations and children's classes in some suburban branch locations. Students from all over the Chicago area attend weekly classes taught by dedicated professionals. Students can also take ensemble classes, working with others on the music of groups like The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and many others. Most classes perform at the end of the eight-week session in the \"Big Gig\" or at local venues. The current enrollment is about 7,000 students per week.\n\nMany well-known folk, world, bluegrass, jazz, blues and country musicians from all over the world perform at the 4544 North Lincoln Avenue location.\n\nThere are two Old Town School Music Stores (one at 4544 North Lincoln Avenue and one at 909 West Armitage Avenue) that sell musical instruments for children and adults, books, CDs, accessories, and more. The Store offers instrument repairs and rentals to students.\n\nSince 1997, Old Town School hosts the Chicago Folk & Roots Festival in nearby Welles Park. However, in 2012, the School announced it would not organize the event due to rising costs from city policy changes. Instead, in collaboration with The Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce, Old Town School hosted the Square Roots festival.\n\nOn December 1, 2007, Old Town School celebrated its 50th Anniversary with a concert at Chicago's Auditorium Theatre featuring Jeff Tweedy, Bela Fleck & Abigail Washburn, David Bromberg, Bonnie Koloc, Frank & Mary Hamilton, Lonnie Brooks with Wayne Baker Brooks and Nicholas Tremulis and Luna Negra Dance Theater.\n\nIn July 2010, the School announced the planned $18 million expansion of their facility to include new classroom and theater space across the street from their current location (on an empty lot purchased in 2005). The new building opened at 4545 North Lincoln Avenue on January 9, 2012. It adds more than 27,000 square feet of acoustically-engineered, state-of-the-art classrooms and a 150-seat flexible use hall called The Myron R. Szold Music and Dance Hall. The building is LEED Gold certified.\n\nOn Friday nights, the School offers 6-String Socials at 909 West Armitage Avenue where students can get together to practice singing and playing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2204155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204155", "title": "Slouching Towards Gomorrah", "text": "Slouching Towards Gomorrah\n\nSlouching Towards Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline is a 1996 non-fiction book by Robert H. Bork, a former United States Court of Appeals judge. Bork's thesis in the book is that U.S. and more generally Western culture is in a state of decline and that the cause of this decline is modern liberalism and the rise of the New Left. Specifically, he attacks modern liberalism for what he describes as its dual emphases on radical egalitarianism and radical individualism. The title of the book is a play on the last couplet of W. B. Yeats's poem \"The Second Coming\": \"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\" Bork contends that the \"rough beast of decadence … now sends us slouching towards our new home, not Bethlehem but Gomorrah.\" More directly, the title borrows from Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem.\n\nBork first traces the rapid expansion of modern liberalism that occurred during the 1960s, arguing that this legacy of radicalism demonstrates that the precepts of modern liberalism are antithetical to the rest of the U.S. political tradition. He then attacks a variety of social, cultural, and political experiences as evidence of U.S. cultural decline and degeneracy. Among these are affirmative action, increased violence in and sexualization of mass media, the legalization of abortion, pressure to legalize assisted suicide and euthanasia, feminism and the decline of religion. Bork, himself a rejected nominee of President Ronald Reagan to the United States Supreme Court, also criticizes that institution and argues that the judiciary and liberal judicial activism are catalysts for U.S. cultural corruption.\n\nIn this light, Bork advocates an amendment to the United States Constitution which would allow Congressional supermajorities to override Supreme Court decisions.\nThe book received a negatively critical response by \"The Mises Review\", which stated that \"Bork's failure to set forward his arguments rigorously leads to a crucial error in his approach to constitutional interpretation\" and that the \"omni-competent state is, for Bork, not a monster to be dispatched but a tool to be used. Whether the state is likely to enforce the values he favors is a question he leaves un-examined\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2204161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204161", "title": "Representation (politics)", "text": "Representation (politics)\n\nPolitical representation is the activity of making citizens \"present\" in public policy making processes when political actors act in the best interest of citizens. This definition of political representation is consistent with a wide variety of views on what representing implies and what the duties of representatives are. For example, representing may imply acting on the expressed wishes of citizens, but it may alternatively imply acting according to what the representatives themselves judge is in the best interests of citizens. And representatives may be viewed as individuals who have been authorized to act on the behalf of others, or may alternatively be viewed as those who will be held to account by those they are representing. Political representation can happen along different units such as social groups and area, and there are different types of representation such as substantive representation and descriptive representation.\n\nUnder the \"accountability\" view, a representative is an individual who will be held to account. Representatives are held accountable if citizens can judge whether the representative is acting in their best interest and sanction the representative accordingly. The descriptive and symbolic views of political representation describe the ways in which political representatives \"stand for\" the people they represent. \"Descriptive\" representatives \"stand for\" to the extent that they resemble, in their descriptive characteristics (e.g. race, gender, class etc.), the people they represent. On the other hand, \"symbolic\" representatives \"stand for\" the people they represent as long as those people believe in or accept them as their representative. Pitkin argues that these views of political representation give an inadequate account of political representation because they lack an account both of how representatives \"act for\" the represented and the normative criteria for judging representative's actions. Hence Pitkin proposes a \"substantive\" view of representation. In this view of political representation, representation is defined as substantive \"acting for\", by representatives, the interests of the people they represent.\n\nIn contrast, Jane Mansbridge has identified four views of democratic political representation: promissory, anticipatory, surrogate and gyroscopic. Mansbridge argues that each of these views provides an account of both how democratic political representatives \"act for\" the people they represent and the normative criteria for assessing the actions of representatives. \"Promissory\" representation is a form of representation in which representatives are chosen and assessed based on the promises they make to the people they represent during election campaigns. For Mansbridge, promissory representation, preoccupied with how representatives are chosen (authorized) and held to account through elections, is the traditional view of democratic political representation. Anticipatory, surrogate and gyroscopic representation, on the other hand, are more modern views that have emerged from the work of empirical political scientists. \"Anticipatory\" representatives take actions that they believe voters (the represented) will reward in the next election. \"Surrogate\" representation occurs when representatives \"act for\" the interest of people outside their constituencies. Finally, in \"gyroscopic\" representation, representatives use their own judgements to determine how and for what they should act for on behalf of the people they represent.\n\nUnder Rehfeld's general theory of representation, a person is considered a representative as long as the particular group she represents judges her as such. In any case of political representation, there are representatives, the represented, a selection agent, a relevant audience and rules by which the relevant judge whether or not a person is a representative. Representatives are those who are selected by a selection agent from a larger set of qualified individuals who are then judged to representatives by a relevant audience using particular rules of judgement. The rules by which a relevant audience judges whether or not a person is a representative can be either democratic or non-democratic. In a case where the selection agent, relevant audience and the represented are the same and the rules of judgment are democratic (e.g. elections), the familiar democratic case of political representation arises and where they are not, undemocratic cases arise.\n\nIn this method, elected representatives will be chosen by more or less numerically equivalent blocks of voters. This is not always practical for historical and current political reasons, and sometimes is impractical purely on the basis of logistics, as in regions where travel is difficult and distances are long. The shortened term \"rep-by-pop\" is used in Britain but is relatively uncommon in the U.S.\n\nHistorically rep-by-pop is the alternative to rep-by-area. However, in the colonial countries, the geographic realities made a necessity of low-population electoral districts in order to give meaningful representation to remote communities, and only in urban and suburban areas has there been any success with applying rep-by-pop more or less evenly\n\nIn the United States and other democracies, typically the lower house of a bicameral (two-chamber) system is based on population—more or less—while the upper House is based on area. Or, as it might be put in the United Kingdom, on title to land, as was originally the case with the old pre-Reforms House of Lords. In the Senate or the Lords, it does not matter how many people are living in a constituent's jurisdiction, it matters that the constituent have the jurisdiction (by election, heredity or appointment—the US, the UK and Canada respectively).\n\nThe principle of rep-by-pop, when brought in and promoted publicly, removed many archaic seats in the British House of Commons although some northern and rural counties necessarily still have variably lower populations than most urban ridings. Former British colonies like Canada and Australia also have rural and wilderness areas spanning tens of thousands of square miles, with fewer voters in them than a tiny urban-core riding. In the most extreme case, one riding of the Canadian parliament covers more than 2 million square kilometres, Nunavut, yet has less than one third the average number of voters for a riding, with a population of about 30,000. Making the riding larger would be difficult for the elected member, as well as for campaigning and also unfair to remotely rural constituents, whose concerns are radically different from those of the medium-sized towns that typically dominate the electorate in such ridings.\n\nThe American Constitution has built into it a series of compromises between rep-by-pop and rep-by-area: two Senators per state, at least one representative per state, and representation in the electoral college. In Canada, provinces such as Prince Edward Island have unequal representation in Parliament (in the Commons as well as the Senate) relative to Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta, partly for historical reasons, partly because those electoral allotments are constitutionally guaranteed, and partly because governments have simply chosen to under-represent certain voters and over-represent others. In the United States, Baker v. Carr (1962) established the \"one-person/one vote\" standard, that each individual had to be weighted equally in legislative apportionment.\n\nIn Canada, until recent reforms, there were still many federal and provincial electoral districts in British Columbia and other provinces that had less than a few thousand votes cast, notably Atlin, covering the province's far northwest, with no more than 1,500. The area of the riding was about the size of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia combined, and larger than many American states. In practicality, the voters of the tiny communities scattered across the subarctic landscape, less than the population of a city block, had as much electoral clout as two Fraser Valley municipalities totaling up to 60,000 in population. The population imbalance between largely rural areas and overwhelmingly urban areas is one reason why the realities of representation by area still have sway against the ideal of representation by population.\n\nUnder representative democracy, (in contrast to descriptive representation) is the tendency of elected legislators to advocate on behalf of certain groups.\n\nConflicting theories and beliefs exist regarding why constituents vote for representatives. \"Rather than choosing candidates on the basis of an informed view of the incumbents' voting records, voters, it is argued, rely primarily on the policy-free 'symbols' of party identification\". Politicians, it would seem, have little to fear from a public that knows little about what laws their representatives support or oppose in the legislature.\n\nScholars have defined representation as \"the making present in some sense of something which is nevertheless not present literally or in fact\". Descriptive representation is the idea that a group elects an individual to represent them who in their own characteristics mirror some of the more frequent experiences and outward manifestations of the group. In this form of representation, representatives are in their own persons and lives in some sense typical of the larger class of persons whom they represent. For example, certain ethnic groups or gender-based groups may want to elect a leader that shares these descriptive characteristics as they may be politically relevant. Disadvantaged groups may gain benefit from descriptive representation primarily in two ways:\n\n\nDescriptive representation can be instituted by political parties independently where they set aside a certain number of party seats for particular groups. It can also be instituted through national electoral quotas either by reserving seats for office or candidate quotas for political parties.\n\nTraditionally, quotas have been thought of as a way of providing adequate representation for previously disadvantaged groups such as women or oppressed ethnic groups. However, another way of conceptualizing quotas is to institute a maximum or ceiling quota for advantaged groups. This may improve the meritocracy of the system and improve the process of candidate selection\n\nEmpirically, quotas show mixed results. In Lesotho, quota-mandated female representation has had no effect or even reduced several dimensions of women's engagement with local politics. In Argentina, quotas have mandated negative stereotypes about women politicians. Meanwhile, in India, women are more likely to win an election in a constituency that formerly had quotas, even when the quotas are removed, and women leaders provide public goods favoured by women constituents. Evidence also shows that caste-based quotas may not change stereotypes of how people view the oppressed caste group, it does change the social norms of interaction between caste groups\n\nDyadic representation refers to the degree to which and ways by which elected legislators represent the preferences or interests of the specific geographic constituencies from which they are elected. Candidates who run for legislative office in an individual constituency or as a member of a list of party candidates are especially motivated to provide dyadic representation. As Carey and Shugart (1995, 417) observe, they have \"incentives to cultivate a personal vote\" beyond whatever support their party label will produce. Personal vote seeking might arise from representing the public policy interests of the constituency (by way of either the delegate, responsible party, or trustee models noted above), providing it \"pork barrel\" goods, offering service to individual constituents as by helping them acquire government services, and symbolic actions.\n\nThe most abundant scientific scholarship on dyadic representation has been for the U.S. Congress and for policy representation of constituencies by the members of the Congress. Miller and Stokes (1963) presented the seminal research of this kind in an exploratory effort to account for when alternative models of policy representation arise. Their work has been emulated, replicated, and enlarged by a host of subsequent studies. The most advanced theoretical formulation in this body of work, however, is by Hurley and Hill (2003) and by Hill, Jordan, and Hurley (2015) who present a theory that accounts well for when belief sharing representation, delegate representation, trustee representation, responsible party representation, and party elite led representation will arise.\n\nThe concept of collective representation can be found in various normative theory and scientific works, but Weissberg (1978, 535) offered the first systematic characterization of it in the scientific literature and for the U.S. Congress, defining such representation as \"Whether Congress as an institution represents the American people, not whether each member of Congress represented his or her particular district.\" Hurley (1982) elaborated and qualified Weissberg's explication of how such representation should be assessed and how it relates to dyadic representation. Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson (1995), offer the most advanced theoretical exposition of such representation for the U.S. Congress. And the latter work was extended in Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson (2002).\n\nIn most parliamentary political systems with strong (or ideologically unified) political parties and where the election system is dominated by parties instead of individual candidates, the primary basis for representation is also a collective, party based one. The foundational work on assessing such representation is that of Huber and Powell (1994) and Powell (2000).\n\n\n\n"}
